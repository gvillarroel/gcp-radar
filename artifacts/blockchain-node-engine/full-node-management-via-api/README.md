# Full node management via API

Product: Blockchain Node Engine
Feature slug: `full-node-management-via-api`
Coverage: `HIGH`
IAM mapping: `unknown`

## Technical Summary

Blockchain Node Engine exposes a control-plane API for blockchain full-node resources identified by names like `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/blockchainNodes/{node}`. This API enables administration of individual full nodes through operations to create, list, retrieve, update (patch), and delete nodes, and includes endpoint information for interacting with a node.
