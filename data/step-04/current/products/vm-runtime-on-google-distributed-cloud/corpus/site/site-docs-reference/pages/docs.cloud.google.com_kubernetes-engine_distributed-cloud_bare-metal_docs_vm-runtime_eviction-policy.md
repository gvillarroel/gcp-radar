This document is for platform administrators that run virtual machines (VMs) in
Google Distributed Cloud. This document shows you how to configure the eviction policy
that controls how VMs that use VM Runtime on GDC can automatically
migrate to other hosts during maintenance events. These configuration settings
let you VMs continue to run on other hosts when you upgrade a cluster or perform
maintenance on a host.
Before you begin
To complete this document, you need access to Google Distributed Cloud version 1.12.0
( anthosBareMetalVersion: 1.12.0 ) or higher cluster. You can use any cluster
type capable of running workloads. If needed,
try Google Distributed Cloud on Compute Engine
or see the
cluster creation overview .
Eviction policy settings
Google Distributed Cloud lets you configure node behavior when you perform cluster
upgrades or place nodes into maintenance mode. VM Runtime on GDC uses
an eviction policy that controls how the cluster handles VMs that run during
these events.
When enabled, VM Runtime on GDC uses live migration to move VM
workloads to another host by default. This behavior minimizes potential
disruption to the VM workloads. With live migration, migratable VMs move from
one host to another without disruption to the guest OS.
Note: If you're upgrading to Google Distributed Cloud 1.12 from a previous
version, you can't take advantage of migration-based eviction during the upgrade
to version 1.12. Migration-based eviction for cluster upgrades is only supported
for Google Distributed Cloud version 1.12 and higher.
The following eviction policy settings can be configured:
Property
Default
Valid values
evictionStrategy
LiveMigrate
LiveMigrate , Restart
maxMigrationAttemptsPerVM
3
Integers in the range [ 1 , 5 ]
migrationTargetInitializationTimeout
30s
Any valid duration string, such as 1m , 2h , or 1h30m
evictionStrategy
If this value is set to LiveMigrate , VM Runtime on GDC attempts to
migrate any migratable VM away from a node to evict it. The VM is placed on
another node in the cluster and continues to run.
Note: The VirtualMachineDisk for a VM must use the ReadWriteMany access mode
for the VM to use live migration. If the VirtualMachineDisk access mode is
ReadWriteOnce , the VM can't live migrate.
If this value is set to Restart , VM Runtime on GDC makes no attempt
to migrate VMs. Instead, VMs are stopped when the node is put into maintenance
mode, and the VMs start again when the node is brought out of maintenance mode.
The VM is unavailable during the host maintenance event.
When you choose the LiveMigrate strategy, VM Runtime on GDC falls
back to the Restart strategy for non-migratable VMs.
maxMigrationAttemptsPerVM
This setting controls the maximum number of migration attempts that can occur
for a particular VM before the Restart strategy applies.
This setting is ignored if evictionStrategy is set to Restart .
migrationTargetInitializationTimeout
This setting controls the maximum amount of time a migration can take to start
before it's considered to have failed. A migration that takes too long to start
counts toward the failed migration budget for a VM workload.
This setting is ignored if evictionStrategy is set to Restart .
Enable and configure the eviction policy
To use the eviction policy in VM Runtime on GDC, the
evictionPolicy setting must be defined in your cluster's VMRuntime object.
This setting is enabled by default. If you upgrade from a previous version, you
must enable this setting manually.
An empty object, such as evictionPolicy: {} , enables the eviction policy with
default settings. To change the default behavior, add additional configuration
options to the evictionPolicy object.
To enable and configure the eviction policy, complete the following steps:
Edit the VMRuntime custom resource:
kubectl edit vmruntime vmruntime
Add or update the evictionPolicy section with an empty object to use
the default eviction policy settings, or add your desired settings:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VMRuntime
metadata :
name : vmruntime
spec :
disableCDIUploadProxyVIP : false
enabled : true
evictionPolicy : {}
useEmulation : false
If the evictionPolicy isn't populated, such as evictionPolicy: null or
isn't included in the manifest, no special action is taken. VMs are forcefully
evicted.
The following example manifests show how to enable live migration of VMs, or
restart the VMs on the same host after maintenance is complete:
Live migrate
The following example eviction policy enables live migration of VMs. The
cluster can retry the live migration up to 3 times, with a 30-second
timeout on the process each time to start:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VMRuntime
metadata :
name : vmruntime
spec :
disableCDIUploadProxyVIP : false
enabled : true
evictionPolicy :
evictionStrategy : LiveMigrate
maxMigrationAttemptsPerVM : 3
migrationTargetInitializationTimeout : 30s
useEmulation : false
Restart
The following example eviction policy makes no attempt at migration for
any VMs during eviction. VMs are stopped on their current host, and start
again when the host finishes its maintenance event:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VMRuntime
metadata :
name : vmruntime
spec :
disableCDIUploadProxyVIP : false
enabled : true
evictionPolicy :
evictionStrategy : Restart
useEmulation : false
Save and close the VMRuntime custom resource in your editor.
VM Runtime on GDC now applies the eviction policy to VMs in your
cluster.
