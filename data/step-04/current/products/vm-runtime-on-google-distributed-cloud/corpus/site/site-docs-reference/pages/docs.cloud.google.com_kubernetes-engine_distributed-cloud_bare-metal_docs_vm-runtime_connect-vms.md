This document is intended for application owners that run Google Distributed Cloud.
This document shows you how to connect to virtual machines (VMs) that use
VM Runtime on GDC. You can connect to VMs directly using an IP
address, or using built-in tools for SSH or console access.
Before you begin
To complete this document, you need access to the following resources:
A VM that runs in one of your clusters. If needed,
create a VM in Google Distributed Cloud .
The virtctl client tool installed as a plugin for kubectl . If needed,
install the virtctl client tool .
Configure passwordless SSH access to VMs
Direct, passwordless SSH access to your VM is facilitated by a guest agent
that's installed by VM Runtime on GDC. Among other duties, the guest
agent installs and expires SSH keys. This capability enables an SSH tunnel for
accessing your VM from clients outside the cluster network.
Enable the guest agent
To enable the guest agent:
Note: For Windows guest operating systems, there are additional steps required
to start the guest agent, initially. For instructions, see the Windows guest OS
tab in Create initial user credentials .
Check your VirtualMachine custom resource to confirm it's configured to
enable the guest agent:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME -o yaml --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
The spec.osType field should be set to the operating system of your VM,
Linux or Windows . The spec.guestEnvironment section shouldn't be
explicitly configured as empty. If the section is configured as empty
( guestEnvironment: {} ), you can remove it entirely to enable the guest
agent.
Your VirtualMachine custom resource for the VM you want to access should
look like this:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : sample-vm
spec :
compute :
cpu :
vcpus : 2
memory :
capacity : 4Gi
...
osType : Linux
...
If necessary, use kubectl edit to update the VirtualMachine custom
resource.
To verify the guest agent is working, check the status in your VM custom
resource:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
When the guest agent is working, you see status: "True" for the
GuestEnvironmentEnabled and GuestEnvironmentDataSynced conditions.
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
...
name : vm-sample-01
...
status :
conditions :
- lastTransitionTime : "2022-10-05T22:40:26Z"
message : ""

- lastTransitionTime : "2022-10-06T21:55:57Z"
message : ""
observedGeneration : 1
reason : GuestEnvironmentDataSynced
status : "True"
type : GuestEnvironmentSynced
...
Enable passwordless SSH access
To enable passwordless SSH access for your VM:
Create a VirtualMachineAccessRequest manifest file, such as
vm-access-request.yaml , in the editor of your choice:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachineAccessRequest
metadata :
name : VMAR_NAME
namespace : VM_NAMESPACE
spec :
vm : VM_NAME
user : USERNAME
ssh :
key : PUBLIC_SSH_KEY
ttl : EXPIRATION_TIME
Replace the following:
VMAR_NAME : the name of the access
request resource.
VM_NAMESPACE : the namespace for
the VM you want to access.
VM_NAME : the name of the VM you want
to access.
USERNAME : the username for user who
is accessing the VM.
PUBLIC_SSH_KEY : the public key
for SSH access. Typically, this is the contents of the id_rsa.pub file.
EXPIRATION_TIME : the ttl
(time-to-live) field specifies the how long the SSH key is valid.
For example, if you specify 30m the SSH key expires after 30 minutes.
This flag uses the following units:
s for seconds
m for minutes
h for hours
d for days
Use kubectl apply to create the VirtualMachineAccessRequest from the
manifest file. For example, if you named your manifest file
vm-access-request.yaml ,
kubectl apply -f MANIFEST --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
MANIFEST : the name of the access
request manifest file. For example, vm-access-request.yaml .
KUBECONFIG : the path to the
kubeconfig file of the cluster that hosts the VM you are accessing.
To verify that your access request configuration succeeded, check the status
of the VirtualMachineAccessRequest :
kubectl get vmar VMAR_NAME -o yaml --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
When the configuration is successful, the status section includes
state: configured :
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachineAccessRequest
metadata :
...
annotations :
kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration : |

Disable the guest agent
When you create a new VM and set the osType field, the guest agent is enabled.
While this feature is in Preview, you can disable it by editing the
VirtualMachine custom resource. Disabling the guest agent disables passwordless
SSH access to your VM.
Note: Features listed as Preview are covered by the
Pre-GA Offerings Terms
of the Google Cloud Terms of Service. Pre-GA products and features might have
limited support, and changes to pre-GA products and features might not be
compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Preview offerings are intended for use in test environments only.
To disable the guest agent:
Use kubectl to stop your VM before you make changes to the configuration:
kubectl virt stop VM_NAME --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Edit your VM resource:
kubectl edit gvm VM_NAME --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Update the VirtualMachine configuration to add an empty spec.guestEnvironment
explicitly:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1alpha1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : vm-example
namespace : default
spec :
compute :
...
osType : Linux
guestEnvironment : {}
Save and close the updated VM manifest in your editor.
Use kubectl to start the VM:
kubectl virt start VM_NAME --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Connect using an IP address
If your VM has an accessible IP address and you already have the credentials to
access the VM, you can connect using a protocol such as SSH, VNC, or RDP.
Connect through IP address
If you can connect directly to your VM's IP address, use one of the following
methods:
SSH
Get the details of your VM to view its IP address:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME --namespace VM_NAMESPACE --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : name for your VM.
VM_NAMESPACE : the namespace
for your VM.
The following example output shows the VM information and IP address:
NAME STATUS AGE IP
vm1 Running 7m 10 .200.0.21
Connect to your VM using an SSH client:
ssh USERNAME @ IP_ADDRESS -i PATH_TO_KEY
Replace the following values:
USERNAME : the username for an
account on your VM.
IP_ADDRESS : the IP
address of your VM obtained in the previous step.
PATH_TO_KEY : the path to the
private SSH key.
VNC or RDP
Virtual Network Computing (VNC)
and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
let you use the graphical console to access your VM. When you use an IP
address, you must enable VNC or RDP in the guest OS before you can use
either to connect to the VM. For information about enabling and using VNC or
RDP, consult the documentation for your guest OS.
You also need existing credentials to sign in to the VM, such as those you
define to
create initial user credentials
when you create a VM.
Get the details of your VM to view its IP address:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME --namespace VM_NAMESPACE --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : name for your VM.
VM_NAMESPACE : the namespace
for your VM.
The following example output shows the VM information and IP address:
NAME STATUS AGE IP
vm1 Running 7m 10.200.0.21
Connect to the IP address of your VM obtained in the previous step using a
client tool and the appropriate port such as VNC port 5900 or RDP port
3389 .
Connect through a Service
If your VM connects to the default pod-network and you can't communicate
directly to the IP address of your VM, expose the VM behind a load balancer
Service .
Create a Service manifest, such as my-service-load-balancer.yaml , in the
editor of your choice:
nano my-service-load-balancer.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
name : VM_NAME -service
spec :
selector :
kubevirt/vm : VM_NAME
ports :
- name : PORT_NAME
protocol : PROTOCOL_TYPE
port : EXTERNAL_PORT
targetPort : TARGET_PORT
type : LoadBalancer
In this Service manifest type, replace the following values:
VM_NAME : the name for your VM to expose for remote access.
PORT_NAME : the name of your protocol, such as ssh , vnc , or
rdp .
PROTOCOL_TYPE : the protocol type, such as TCP for SSH and RDP, or
UDP for VNC.
EXTERNAL_PORT : the external port number to expose and that you use to
connect to.
TARGET_PORT : the target port, such as 22 for SSH.
Save and close the Service manifest in your editor.
Create the Service using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-service-load-balancer.yaml --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Get the EXTERNAL-IP address of the load balancer service:
kubectl get service VM_NAME -service --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
The IP address of the load balancer is displayed, as shown in the following example output:
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
vm1-service LoadBalancer 172.26.232.167 10.200.0.51 22:31141/TCP 6d20h
Connect to the EXTERNAL-IP address of the load balancer with a standard
protocol, such as using an SSH client:
ssh USERNAME @ LOAD_BALANCER_IP_ADDRESS -i PATH_TO_KEY
Replace the following values:
USERNAME : the username for an account on your VM.
LOAD_BALANCER_IP_ADDRESS : the IP address of your load
balancer.
PATH_TO_KEY : the path to the
private SSH key.
Connect directly using SSH
If your client is connected to the same physical network as your bare metal
cluster nodes and you don't require the use of SSH tunnels to connect to the
cluster, you can connect using kubectl virt ssh .
To use SSH to connect a Linux VM from the console with the virtctl add-on:
kubectl virt ssh USERNAME @ VM_NAME --namespace VM_NAMESPACE --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Replace the following values:
USERNAME : the username to access your VM. This
account is created if it doesn't exist on the VM.
VM_NAME : the name of your VM.
After you have successfully connected using SSH the VM and no longer need the
connection, exit the SSH session:
exit
Connect directly using the console
If you don't have direct network connectivity to your Linux VM for SSH access,
connect to the console of the VM using the VM Runtime on GDC console.
This method opens a serial console. Upon connection, you are given a command
prompt, instead of a graphical console.
To access a Linux VM from the console, use the virtctl add-on:
kubectl virt console VM_NAME --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Replace VM_NAME with the name of your VM.
When prompted, enter the user credentials for your VM. These credentials must
exist on the VM, or be applied when the VM is created. If needed see the
following section to
create initial user credentials
when you create a VM.
After you've successfully connected to the console of the VM and no longer
need the connection, exit the VM session and console:
Ctrl + ]
Connect directly using VNC
You can use the kubectl virt vnc command to open the Virtual Network Computing
(VNC) graphical console to access your VMs. This method works for VMs running
either a Windows or a Linux guest OS. When you use the kubectl virt vnc
command, VM Runtime on GDC opens VNC for you, so you aren't required to
enable VNC in the guest OS.
You need existing credentials to sign in to the VM, such as those you
define to
create initial user credentials
when you create a VM.
To access a VM using VNC, use the virtctl add-on:
kubectl virt vnc VM_NAME --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Replace VM_NAME with the name of your VM.
When prompted, enter the user credentials for your VM.
After you've successfully connected to the VNC session of the VM and no
longer need the connection, log off from the VM to close the VNC connection.
Create initial user credentials
When you connect to your VM using the console, you must specify user
credentials. The process for creating initial user credentials differs for Linux
and Windows guest operating systems.
Linux guest OS
For Linux VMs, user credentials can be built in to your custom images, or can
be specified when you create a VM.
Use the --configure-initial-password parameter with kubectl virt create
command:
kubectl virt create vm VM_NAME \
--image ubuntu20.04 \
--os-type Linux \
--configure-initial-password USERNAME : PASSWORD \
--kubeconfig KUBECONFIG
Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : name for your VM.
USERNAME : username for the
account to create on the VM.
PASSWORD : password for the user
account.
This example command creates a Linux VM that runs Ubuntu 20.04. It's
recommended that you change the initial credentials after you first sign
in to the VM.
Note: To change credentials on an existing VM, connect to the VM using
kubectl virt console VM_NAME and then update the credentials within the
guest OS.
Windows guest OS
Use the following steps to reset a password for an existing user or create the
initial password for a new user:
Enable the guest agent in your Windows VM:
Configure the VM to enable the guest agent .
Use VNC or RDP to connect to the VM.
In the VM, navigate to the guest agent drive. In most cases, this is
drive E: .
Use PowerShell to run install.ps1 .
This installs and starts the guest agent. The guest agent starts
automatically for subsequent VM reboots.
Close the remote session.
On your admin workstation, use the following command to reset (or set if
you use a new username) the Windows VM password:
kubectl virt reset-windows-password VM_NAME \
--user = USERNAME \
--namespace = VM_NAMESPACE
Replace the following:
VM_NAME : the name of the VM.
USERNAME : the username you want to
reset (or set) the password for. If the username is new, the command creates a
new Windows account and sets the initial password.
VM_NAMESPACE :
(Optional) the namespace of the VM. This flag is optional. If not
specified, the default namespace, default , is used.
To reset (or set) password without a confirmation prompt, use the optional
--force flag. When you use the --force flag, the prompt warns you of
the consequences of resetting the password for an existing account.
Without the --force flag, the command prompts you to confirm the
password reset with the following text:
This command creates an account and sets an initial password for the
user USERNAME if the account does not already exist.
If the account already exists, resetting the password can cause the
LOSS OF ENCRYPTED DATA secured with the current password, including
files and stored passwords.
Would you like to set or reset the password for USERNAME (Y/n)?
After you confirm (or force) the password reset, the command returns the
new password for the specified VM and username:
Resetting and retrieving password for USERNAME on VM_NAME
vm_name: VM_NAME
username: USERNAME
password: PASSWORD
