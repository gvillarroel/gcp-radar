Edit VM configuration in VM Runtime on GDC
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document is intended for application owners that use
VM Runtime on GDC to run virtual machines (VMs) in clusters created
with Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on bare metal. This document shows
you how to edit VMs running in bare metal clusters. For example, you can edit
resource allocation, such as CPU and memory, or change the network a VM connects
to.
You can modify any field in the spec section of a VirtualMachine resource.
You can also edit the labels for a VM. Other fields, such as the VM name
( metadata.name ), can't be edited. By default, your VM must be in a Stopped
state before you edit the resource. However, starting with
Google Distributed Cloud version 1.13.0, you can configure your VirtualMachine
resource to restart automatically whenever you change the
configuration.
If your edits to the VirtualMachine resource contain errors when you save
them, the changes are rejected and you see a notification. Correct the
errors and try to save the VirtualMachine resource again. If your VM doesn't
start after you make changes, use the
kubectl describe gvm VM_NAME command to
view troubleshooting information and correct the errors.
Before you begin
To complete this document, you need access to the following resources:
A VM that runs in one of your clusters. If needed,
create a VM in a bare metal cluster .
The virtctl client tool installed as a plugin for kubectl . If needed,
install the virtctl client tool .
Edit compute resources
If your compute workload demands change, you can update the number of virtual
CPUs and amount of virtual memory you assign to your VMs. To edit your compute
workloads, complete the following steps:
Stop the VM that you want to edit:
kubectl virt stop VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you
want to stop.
Use kubectl to edit the VM:
kubectl edit gvm VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you
want to edit.
In your editor, update the compute resource values that you want to change.
For example, the following sample VirtualMachine manifest shows that the VM
resource has 2 vCPUs assigned:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : vm1
spec :
...
compute :
cpu :
vcpus : 2
...
If you want to update the number of assigned vCPUs, change the value in your
editor, as shown in the following example:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : vm1
spec :
...
compute :
cpu :
vcpus : 4
...
Save and close the VM manifest.
Start the VM that you edited:
kubectl virt start VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you
edited.
Check the STATUS of your VM:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME
Make sure that your VM is in a Running state. If your VM requests more
compute resources than the host can provide, your VM can't start. If the VM
isn't in a Running state, check your VirtualMachine resource manifest and
the compute resource availability on the host.
The following example output shows the VM in a Running state:
NAME STATUS AGE IP
vm1 Running 1m 192.168.2.72
View detailed information about a VM using kubectl describe gvm :
kubectl describe gvm VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you
edited.
The following example output shows the condensed information for a VM, with a
change to the number of vCPUs successfully applied:
Name : vm1
Namespace : default
Labels : < none >
Annotations : < none >
API Version : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
Kind : VirtualMachine
...
Spec :
Compute :
Cpu :
Vcpus : 4
...
For more information, see how to
create VMs with specific vCPU and memory compute configurations .
Edit disk resources
If your storage requirements change, you can add or remove virtual disks to a
VM. To edit the disks attached to your VM, complete the following steps:
Stop the VM that you want to edit:
kubectl virt stop VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you
want to stop.
Use kubectl to edit the VM:
kubectl edit gvm VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you
want to edit.
In your editor, update the spec.disks section to attach or detach disks.
For example, the following sample VirtualMachine manifest shows that only a
boot disk is attached to the VM:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : vm1
spec :
...
disks :
- boot : true
virtualMachineDiskName : vm1-boot-dv
...
If you want to add an existing empty disk, update the disk configuration in
your editor, as shown in the following example:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : vm1
spec :
...
disks :
- boot : true
virtualMachineDiskName : vm1-boot-dv
- virtualMachineDiskName : DISK_NAME
...
Replace DISK_NAME with the name of the disk to attach.
Save and close the VM manifest.
Start the VM that you edited:
kubectl virt start VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you edited.
Check the STATUS of your VM:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME
Make sure that your VM is in a Running state. If your VM requests a
StorageClass or disk assignment that the host can't provide, your VM can't
start. If the VM isn't in a Running state, check your VirtualMachine and
VirtualMachineDisk resource manifests and the host storage support.
View detailed information about a VM using kubectl describe gvm :
kubectl describe gvm VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you edited.
The following example output shows the condensed information for a VM, with
a change to the attached disks successfully applied:
Name : vm1
Namespace : default
Labels : < none >
Annotations : < none >
API Version : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
Kind : VirtualMachine
...
Spec :
Disks :
Name : vm1-boot-dv
Name : data-disk-01
...
For more information, see how to
create and manage disks .
Edit network resources
As your infrastructure changes, you might want to change the network
configuration for a VM. For example, you might want to connect the VM to a
different virtual network or manually assign an IP address. To edit the network
configuration for a VM, complete the following steps:
Stop the VM that you want to edit:
kubectl virt stop VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you want to
stop.
Use kubectl to edit the VM:
kubectl edit gvm VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you want to
edit.
In your editor, update the network configuration settings that you want to
change.
For example, the following sample VirtualMachine manifest shows that the VM
connects to a network named backend-vlan100 and uses DHCP since no IP
address is defined:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : vm1
spec :
...
interfaces :
- name : eth0
networkName : backend-vlan100
default : true
...
If you want to change the network that the VM connects to or assign a manual
IP address, update the network configuration in your editor, as shown in the
following example:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : vm1
spec :
...
interfaces :
- name : eth0
networkName : NETWORK_NAME
ipAddresses :
- IP_ADDRESS
default : true
...
Replace NETWORK_NAME with the name of the network to
connect to, or add the ipAddresses section and specify the
IP_ADDRESS for your VM to use.
Save and close the VM manifest.
Start the VM that you edited:
kubectl virt start VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you edited.
Check the STATUS of your VM:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME
Make sure that your VM is in a Running state. If your VM requests a
network connection that the host can't provide, your VM can't start. If the VM
isn't in a Running state, check your VirtualMachine resource manifest and
the host network support.
View detailed information about a VM using kubectl describe gvm :
kubectl describe gvm VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you edited.
The following example output shows the condensed information for a VM, with a
change to the network and IP address configuration successfully applied:
Name : vm1
Namespace : default
Labels : < none >
Annotations : < none >
API Version : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
Kind : VirtualMachine
...
Spec :
Compute :
Interfaces :
Name : eth0
Network Name : backend-vlan200
...
Status :

Configure your VM for automatic restarts
Many VM configuration changes, such as changes to the compute settings,
require the VM to be stopped and restarted for the changes to get synchronized
with the corresponding VM instance ( VirtualMachineInstance ). VMs running in
version 1.13.0 clusters or higher can be configured to restart
automatically whenever you make changes to their configuration. When you
configure a VM to use this feature, you don't need to stop and restart a VM when
you edit its custom resource. VM Runtime on GDC monitors the VM and, if
it detects a configuration change, it restarts the VM automatically to sync the
changes.
If you are using Config Sync to manage your YAML configuration
files, this feature is especially useful. Without this feature, you must stop
the VM manually before you make any changes to the VirtualMachine custom
resource and start the VM manually after you've completed your changes.
To enable automatic restarts:
Note: You don't need to stop and restart the VM to enable automatic restarts.
The autoRestartOnConfigurationChange field, like the autoDelete field for
disks, isn't synchronized with the VM instance.
Use kubectl to edit the VM:
kubectl edit gvm VM_NAME
In your editor, add the autoRestartOnConfigurationChange field and set it
to true .
You can make additional changes to your VM, such as update the vcpus
value. If you edit compute settings, VM Runtime on GDC restarts
your VM automatically when you save your changes.
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
...
name : vm-sample-01
namespace : default
resourceVersion : "16711824"
uid : ed623879-0cfa-52de-ad2c-b63308e6116c
spec :
autoRestartOnConfigurationChange : true
compute :
cpu :
vcpus : 2
...
Save and close the VM manifest.
If you have made any other changes to the VM that need to be synchronized
with the corresponding VM instance, VM Runtime on GDC restarts the
VM. If you've only made the change to enable automatic restarts, no VM
restart is needed.
Check the status of your VM:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME
Depending upon how quickly you get the VM, you may see state: Starting as
the VM restarts. When the VM has successfully restarted, you see state:
Running . Subsequent configuration changes to the VirtualMachine custom
resource don't require you to stop and start the VM manually. Subsequent
changes to the custom resource are reflected in the VM instance
consistently.
Note the following situational feature behavior:
If you stop a VM manually before you edit the VirtualMachine custom
resource, the configuration change doesn't trigger a restart. The stopped
state of the VM before the configuration change is persisted.
If you have made label or scheduling changes for the VM prior to enabling the
automatic restart feature, adding autoRestartOnConfigurationChange now
without any other change doesn't trigger a restart. Ideally, this feature
keeps the VM instance consistent with the VM configuration. However,
VM Runtime on GDC can't detect prior inconsistencies.
