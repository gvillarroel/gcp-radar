This document describes how to configure clusters and VMs to support high
performance and low latency workloads with the computing efficiencies of
non-uniform memory access (NUMA). There are instructions for tuning Kubernetes
settings for cluster nodes. This document also includes instructions for
configuring Virtual Machines (VMs) with NUMA affinity so that they get scheduled
on and take advantage of the NUMA nodes .
With a NUMA-aware VM, all the communication within the VM is local to the NUMA
node. The NUMA-aware VM avoids data transactions to and from remote
resources that can degrade VM performance.
Configure nodes to use NUMA
The following sections describe how to configure the critical Kubernetes
components to tune the node and make sure it can schedule NUMA-aware containers.
These NUMA nodes are tuned to optimize CPU and memory performance. Follow the
instructions for each node that you want to run NUMA-aware VMs.
Update the kubelet configuration
As part of the node configuration to support NUMA node affinity, you need to
make the following changes in the kubelet configuration:
Enable the CPU Manager with a static policy
Enable the Memory Manager with a Static policy
Enable the Topology manager with restricted topology
To configure kubelet on your worker node:
Note: You may need to use sudo to run some of the following commands.
Locate the kubelet file on your worker node and open it for editing:
edit /etc/default/kubelet
If you don't see the kubelet file, create it with the following command:
echo "KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=\"\"" >> /etc/default/kubelet
This command creates the kubelet file with an empty
KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS="" section.
To enable the CPU Manager with a static policy, add the
--cpu-manager-policy=static flag to the KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=""
section of the file:
KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=" --cpu-manager-policy=static "
To enable the Memory Manager with a Static policy, add the
--memory-manager-policy=Static flag to the KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=""
section of the file:
KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS="--cpu-manager-policy=static --memory-manager-policy=Static "
To enable the Topology Manager with a restricted policy, add the
--topology-manager-policy=restricted flag to the KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=""
section of the file:
KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS="--cpu-manager-policy=static --memory-manager-policy=Static --topology-manager-policy=restricted "
Check the current amount of memory reserved by Google Distributed Cloud:
cat /var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env
The output should look like the following:
KUBELET_KUBEADM_ARGS="--anonymous-auth=false --authentication-token-webhook=true --authorization-mode=Webhook --container-runtime=remote --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock --feature-gates=SeccompDefault=true --kube-reserved=cpu=100m,memory=3470Mi --max-pods=110 --node-ip=192.168.1.190 --node-labels=baremetal.cluster.gke.io/k8s-ip=192.168.1.190,baremetal.cluster.gke.io/namespace=cluster-user001,baremetal.cluster.gke.io/node-pool=node-pool-1,cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool=node-pool-1 --pod-infra-container-image=gcr.io/anthos-baremetal-release/pause-amd64:3.1-gke.5 --provider-id=baremetal://192.168.1.190 --read-only-port=10255 --rotate-server-certificates=true --seccomp-default=true"
The --kube-reserved=cpu=100m,memory=3470Mi setting indicates that
Google Distributed Cloud has reserved 3,470 mebibytes of memory on the node.
Set the --reserved-memory flag in the KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS section of the
kubelet file to 100 mebibytes more than the current reserved memory to
account for the eviction threshold. If there is no reserved memory, you can
skip this step.
For example, with the reserved memory of 3470Mi from the example in the
preceding step, you reserve 3570Mi of memory in the kubelet file:
KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS="--cpu-manager-policy=static --memory-manager-policy=Static --topology-manager-policy=restricted --reserved-memory=0:memory=3570Mi "
Remove CPU and memory state files from the /var/lib directory:
rm /var/lib/cpu_manager_state
rm /var/lib/memory_manager_state
Restart kubelet:
systemctl start kubelet
For more information about these policy settings, see the following
Kubernetes documentation:
CPU Management Policies
Memory Manager configuration
Topology Manager restricted policy
Configure the node to use hugepages
Once you have enabled Memory Manager with the Static policy, you can add
hugepages to further improve container workload performance on your NUMA nodes.
Hugepages, as the name suggests, let you specify memory pages that are larger
than the standard 4 kibibyte (KiB). VM Runtime on GDC supports 2
mebibyte (MiB) and 1 gibibyte (GiB) hugepages. You can set hugepages for a node
at runtime, or for when the node machine boots. We recommend that you configure
hugepages on each node that you want to run NUMA-aware VMs.
To configure the number of hugepages of a specific size on your NUMA node at
runtime, use the following command:
echo HUGEPAGE_QTY > \
/sys/devices/system/node/ NUMA_NODE /hugepages/hugepages- HUGEPAGE_SIZE kB/nr_hugepages
Replace the following:
HUGEPAGE_QTY : the number of
hugepages to allocate of the specified size.
NUMA_NODE : the NUMA node, such
as node0 , to which you're allocating hugepages.
HUGEPAGE_SIZE : the size of
the hugepages in kibibytes, 2048 (2 MiB) or 1048576 (1 GiB).
Configure a VM to use the NUMA node
Once your cluster nodes are tuned for NUMA, you can create NUMA-aware VMs.
NUMA-aware VMs are scheduled on NUMA nodes.
To create a NUMA-aware VM:
Follow the instructions to
create a VM from a manifest .
Use the following compute settings to configure your VM to be NUMA-aware:
spec.compute.guaranteed : Set guaranteed to true . With this setting,
the virt-launcher Pod is configured to be placed in the Kubernetes
Guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) class .
spec.compute.advancedCompute :
dedicatedCPUPlacement : Set dedicatedCPUPlacement to true . This
setting pins virtual CPUs to the physical CPUs of the node.
hugePageSize : Set hugePageSize to either 2Mi or 1Gi to specify
the hugepages size for your VM to use, 2 mebibyte or 1 gibibyte.
numaGuestMappingPassthrough : Include an empty structure ( {} ) for
this setting. This setting establishes NUMA affinity so that your VM is
scheduled on NUMA nodes only.
The following example VirtualMachine manifest shows how a NUMA-aware VM
configuration might look:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : vm1
spec :
compute :
cpu :
vcpus : 2
guaranteed : true
advancedCompute :
dedicatedCPUPlacement : true
hugePageSize : 2Mi
numaGuestMappingPassthrough : {}
memory :
capacity : 256Mi
interfaces :
- name : eth0
networkName : pod-network
default : true
disks :
- virtualMachineDiskName : disk-from-gcs
boot : true
readOnly : true
