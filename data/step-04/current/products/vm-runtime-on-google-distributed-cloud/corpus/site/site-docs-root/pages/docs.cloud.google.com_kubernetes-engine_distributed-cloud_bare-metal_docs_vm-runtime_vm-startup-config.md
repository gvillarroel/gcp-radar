When you use Google Distributed Cloud version 1.13.0 and later, you can specify
startup routines to customize the initialization of your VM on startup. You can
configure your VM to create SSH keys, add users and passwords, install packages,
write files, configure network settings, and more.
These startup tasks are configured with either the cloud-init API or with
startup scripts API (not both). These startup directives are specified in the
VirtualMachine YAML manifest file and execute automatically each time your VM
starts.
Prerequisites
In order to configure a VM with startup directives, you must meet the following
prerequisites:
Enable VM Runtime on GDC .
Use a verified Linux guest OS and set
osType to Linux in the VM manifest. Windows guest OSes aren't supported
for this capability, since they don't support cloud-init.
Ensure that the guest OS has cloud-init installed. Most recent Linux OSes
include cloud-init.
The following sections describe how to specify startup routines in the VM
manifest with either the cloud-init API or
startup scripts .
Use the cloud-init API to initialize VMs
Cloud-init is
commonly used for cloud instance initialization and for customizing VMs during
startup. VM initialization typically involves tasks like package installations,
repository setup, SSH key creation, writing data out to files, and setting up
other aspects of your VM. You incorporate cloud-init configuration YAML into the
VirtualMachine custom resource with the spec.cloudInit field. When your VM
instance starts, cloud-init reads the provided data and initializes the VM
accordingly.
Note the following details of our cloud-init implementation:
You specify cloud-init data in the VirtualMachine YAML manifest when you
create or update a VM. For instructions to create a VM by applying a manifest,
see
Tutorial: Create and manage a Linux VM in VM Runtime on GDC .
We use the
NoCloud data source ,
spec.cloudInit.noCloud , in our VM spec.
You specify user data and network data in separate
sections in the VirtualMachine manifest. The section naming and structure
depend upon the data format you decide to use.
You can specify cloud-init configuration information in the following data
formats:
Clear text
Base64-encoded string
Kubernetes Secret
Note: You can't specify both cloud-init API directives ( spec.cloudInit ) and
startup scripts ( spec.startupScripts ) in the same
VirtualMachine manifest.
To help you get started, we've provided some
configuration examples for common VM initialization tasks.
Cloud-init user data
VM Runtime on GDC supports cloud-init user data in
cloud-config syntax ,
so begin your user data with #cloud-config . You can format the user data as
clear text, a base64-encoded string, or a Kubernetes Secret.
Note: When using clear text or a base64-encoded string, the maximum size allowed
is 2048 bytes. If the user data size is near or greater than 2048 bytes, specify
it as a Kubernetes Secret.
For more information about user data syntax and module reference, see the
cloud-init documentation .
Cloud-init user data as clear text
The following example manifest shows how to specify user data as clear text. In
this case, cloud-init executes a command when the VM starts:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
userData : |
#cloud-config
runcmd:
- echo hello
Cloud-init user data as a base64-encoded string
The following example shows how to specify user data in base64-encoded format.
In this example, the user data consists of the same echo hello command as in
the clear text example :
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
userDataBase64 : I2Nsb3VkLWNvbmZpZwpydW5jbWQ6CiAgLSBlY2hvIGhlbGxvCg==
Cloud-init user data as a Kubernetes Secret
The following example shows a YAML manifest for both a VirtualMachine and a
Secret . The spec.cloudInit.noCloud.secretRef section in the VirtualMachine
configuration indicates that the cloud-init user data is in a Kubernetes Secret
named my-sec . The corresponding Secret configuration specifies the user data
as a key-value pair. The base64-encoded value in this case is the cloud-init
user data in cloud-config syntax.
In the referenced Secret, use the data key userData (shown) or userdata to
specify the cloud-init user data.
In this example, the user data consists of the same echo hello command as in
the clear text example :
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
secretRef :
name : my-sec
---
apiVersion : v1
kind : Secret
type : Opaque
metadata :
name : my-sec
data :
userData : I2Nsb3VkLWNvbmZpZwpydW5jbWQ6CiAgLSBlY2hvIGhlbGxvCg==
If the referenced Secret isn't found or the data key userData or userdata
doesn't exist in the Secret, note the following VM startup behavior:
For VM creation, the VM is put in an ErrorConfiguration state with a
detailed reason and message.
In other cases, the VM continues to use the old cloud-init user data until
the VM is correctly configured. As a result, guest agent enable or disable
updates don't take effect until the VM is correctly configured.
To retrieve VM information, including what cloud-init user data was used, use
the following command:
kubectl get vm VM_NAME -o yaml --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG_PATH
Replace the following:
VM_NAME : the name of your VM.
KUBECONFIG_PATH : the path to the
kubeconfig file for the cluster containing your VM.
To retrieve the related Kubernetes warning event, use either kubectl get event
or kubectl describe gvm .
Cloud-init network data
Similar to user data, you can format the network data as clear text, a
base64-encoded string, or a Kubernetes Secret. Unlike user data, network data
doesn't use cloud-config syntax.
When using clear text or a base64-encoded string, the maximum size allowed
is 2048 bytes. If the user data size is near or greater than 2048 bytes, specify
it as a Kubernetes Secret.
For more information about network data syntax and related details, see the
Networking Config Version 2
in the cloud-init documentation.
Tip: The following sections illustrate how to specify cloud-init network data in
the VirtualMachine configuration in different formats. The example network
data enables DHCP for all ethernet devices with names that start with an "e".
This specific cloud-init directive to enable DHCP is automatically embedded in
the VM for you, so you don't need to specify it yourself.
Cloud-init network data as clear text
The following example manifest shows how to specify network data as clear text.
In this case, cloud-init enables DHCP for all ethernet devices with names that
start with an "e" ( e* ):
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
userData : |
#cloud-config
runcmd:
- echo hello
networkData : |
version: 2
ethernets:
alleths:
match:
name: e*
dhcp4: true
Cloud-init network data as a base64-encoded string
The following example shows how to specify network data in base64-encoded format.
In this example, the network data consists of the same DHCP configuration
specified in the clear text example :
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
networkDataBase64 : dmVyc2lvbjogMgpldGhlcm5ldHM6CiAgYWxsZXRoczoKICAgIG1hdGNoOgogICAgICBuYW1lOiBlKgogICAgZGhjcDQ6IHRydWUK
Cloud-init network data as a Kubernetes Secret
The following example shows a YAML manifest for both a VirtualMachine and a
Secret . The spec.cloudInit.noCloud.networkDataSecretRef section in the VirtualMachine
configuration indicates that the cloud-init network data is in a Kubernetes Secret
named my-sec . The corresponding Secret configuration specifies the network data
as a key-value pair. The base64-encoded value in this case is the cloud-init
network data.
In the referenced Secret, use the data key networkData (shown) or
networkdata to specify the cloud-init network data.
In this example, the network data consists of the same DHCP configuration
specified in the clear text example :
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
networkDataSecretRef :
name : my-sec
---
apiVersion : v1
kind : Secret
type : Opaque
metadata :
name : my-sec
data :
networkData : dmVyc2lvbjogMgpldGhlcm5ldHM6CiAgYWxsZXRoczoKICAgIG1hdGNoOgogICAgICBuYW1lOiBlKgogICAgZGhjcDQ6IHRydWUK
Cloud-init examples
The following sections contain clear text examples of some common use cases for
VM initialization with cloud-init:
Configure authorized SSH keys
Add a new user
Run commands on the first startup
Write files
Configure authorized SSH keys
The following user data example assigns the authorized SSH key
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaK8L93bWxnyp to the default user.
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
userData : |
#cloud-config
ssh_authorized_keys:
- ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaK8L93bWxnyp
Add a new user
The following user data example creates a user test and gives test full
sudo access. This example assigns the user a non-expiring password of pwd .
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
userData : |
#cloud-config
users:
- default
- name: test
sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
chpasswd:
list: |
test:pwd
expire: False
Run commands on the first startup
The following user data example runs an echo command and an ls command. You
can use commands to install packages and more when your VM starts.
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
userData : |
#cloud-config
runcmd:
- [ echo, hello ]
- [ ls, -l, / ]
Write files
The following user data example writes a bash script to the file test in the
/var/lib/google directory of your VM. The cloud-init directives set the file
permissions to read, write, and execute ( 0744 ) for the file owner.
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
cloudInit :
noCloud :
userData : |
#cloud-config
write_files:
- path: /var/lib/google/test
permissions: 0744
content: |
#!/bin/bash
echo hello
Troubleshooting cloud-init
If you encounter issues with your VM initialization and you're using
cloud-init, check the following cloud-init logs in your VM:
/var/log/cloud-init.log : By default, cloud-init writes all events with a
level of DEBUG or higher to this log.
/var/log/cloud-init-output.log : By default, cloud-init directs both stdout
and stderr from all cloud-init stages to this log.
Use startup scripts to initialize VMs
Startup scripts perform tasks during the startup process of a virtual machine
(VM) instance. You can specify one or more scripts in the spec.startupScripts
section of the VirtualMachine spec. Startup scripts can be used to initialize
your VM. VM initialization typically involves tasks like package installations,
repository setup, SSH key creation, writing data out to files, and setting up
other aspects of your VM.
Note the following details for startup scripts:
You specify startup scripts in the VirtualMachine YAML manifest when you
create or update a VM. For instructions to create a VM by applying a manifest,
see
Tutorial: Create and manage a Linux VM in VM Runtime on GDC .
Specified scripts run every time the VM starts.
Include #!/bin/... at the top of the script to indicate the script
interpreter. For example, include #!/bin/bash to execute the script with the
Bash shell.
You can't specify both cloud-init API directives
( spec.cloudInit ) and startup scripts ( spec.startupScripts ) in the same
VirtualMachine manifest.
Note: If you're using Google Distributed Cloud version 1.13.0, you must start the
VM twice for startup scripts to take effect under specific circumstances. This
VM start behavior applies only when you update an existing VM that has no
startup scripts to include startup scripts. This issue is fixed in
Google Distributed Cloud release 1.13.1 and higher.
Script formats
You can specify startup scripts in the following data formats:
Clear text
Base64-encoded string
Kubernetes Secret
Note the following rules for working with different script formats:
When using clear text or a base64-encoded string, the maximum size allowed for
script contents is 2048 bytes. If your script content size is near or greater
than 2048 bytes, specify scripts as a Kubernetes Secret.
When using a Kubernetes Secret, use the data key script in the referenced
Secret to specify the script content.
If a referenced Secret isn't found or the data key script doesn't exist in
the referenced Secret, the VM continues to run the script. The VM doesn't,
however, write or update the script content. In this case, you can find the
Kubernetes warning event with either kubectl get event or
kubectl describe gvm .
The following sample VirtualMachine YAML manifest contains three scripts, one
in each of the supported formats. In this case, each script runs the echo
hello command shown in myscript1 , the clear text example.
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : "my-vm"
spec :
...
startupScripts :
- name : myscript1
script : |
#!/bin/bash
echo hello
- name : myscript2
scriptBase64 : IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKICAgICAgZWNobyBoZWxsbwo=
- name : myscript3
scriptSecretRef :
name : my-sec
---
apiVersion : v1
kind : Secret
type : Opaque
metadata :
name : my-sec
data :
script : IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKICAgICAgZWNobyBoZWxsbwo=
Script troubleshooting
To check the script results or logs, run the following command:
journalctl -u cloud-final
The startup script log entries begin with the following text:
started to run the command /var/lib/google/startup-scripts/ SCRIPT_NAME ...
The log entry includes SCRIPT_NAME , the name of the
startup script.
