Create and use storage classes in VM Runtime on GDC
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document is intended for application owners and platform administrators
that run Google Distributed Cloud. This document shows you how to create and use
storage classes for VMs that use VM Runtime on GDC. A StorageClass
lets you define different storage configurations to provide for the various
needs of your VMs.
Before you begin
To complete this document, you need access to Google Distributed Cloud version 1.12.0
( anthosBareMetalVersion: 1.12.0 ) or higher cluster. You can use any cluster
type capable of running workloads. If needed,
try Google Distributed Cloud on Compute Engine
or see the
cluster creation overview .
Storage classes overview
You use a StorageClass to define the type of storage you make available to
VMs. Different storage classes might map to a different type of storage
hardware, file system, or performance. You can create and use storage classes to
support your compute workloads in VM Runtime on GDC. For more
information, see
Storage Classes .
A default StorageClass can be defined in the custom resource for
VM Runtime on GDC. If you don't define a specific class when you
create a VirtualMachineDisks, this default StorageClass is used. No initial
StorageClass is configured and set as default. In the following section, you
learn how to
set or update this default StorageClass .
Set or update the default StorageClass
Initially, Google Distributed Cloud with VM Runtime on GDC have no default
StorageClass configured. To create a VirtualMachineDisk without specifying a
StorageClass , you must first
create a StorageClass
and then set it as default.
If you want to initially set or update the default StorageClass that
VM Runtime on GDC uses when you create a VirtualMachineDisk , update
the VMRuntime custom resource.
Edit the VMRuntime custom resource:
kubectl edit vmruntime
Add or update the spec.storage section that specifies the default
StorageClass to use:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VMRuntime
metadata :
name : vmruntime
spec :
enabled : true
storage :
defaultStorageClass : STORAGE_CLASS_NAME
...
Edit STORAGE_CLASS_NAME with the name of the default
StorageClass you want to use. If you need to first create a StorageClass ,
see
Create a StorageClass .
Save and close the VMRuntime custom resource in your editor.
The StorageClass you specified is now used when you now create a virtual
machine disk and don't specify a StorageClass . The following section shows
you how to
create a disk and use a specific StorageClass .
Existing VirtualMachineDisk resources are not updated to use the newly
specified StorageClass .
Use a specific StorageClass
If you don't want to use the default StorageClass when you create a
VirtualMachineDisk , use the storageClassName field to specify a different
StorageClass .
To use a specific, already-defined StorageClass when you create a
VirtualMachineDisk , complete the following steps:
Create a VirtualMachineDisk manifest, such as my-disk.yaml , in the
editor of your choice:
nano my-disk.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachineDisk
metadata :
name : DISK_NAME
spec :
size : 10Gi
storageClassName : STORAGE_CLASS_NAME
Replace the following values:
DISK_NAME : the name for your disk.
STORAGE_CLASS_NAME : the StorageClass to use for
your disk. This StorageClass must already exist. If you need to first
create a StorageClass , see
Create a StorageClass .
Save and close the disk manifest in your editor.
Create the disk using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-disk.yaml
Configure storage profiles
Storage profiles provide extra configuration options associated with each
StorageClass . These configuration options include which access mode and volume
mode to use for VirtualMachineDisks that use the StorageClass .
Without a configured storage profile, disks default to the ReadWriteOnce
access mode. This access mode isn't sufficient for production workloads, as
features like live migration don't work. The default volume mode without a
configured storage profile is Filesystem .
VM Runtime on GDC automatically generates one storage profile for
each StorageClass in a cluster. The storage profile is the same name as the
associated StorageClass . The following example output shows that the cluster
has four storage classes and associated profiles:
$ kubectl get storageprofiles
NAME AGE
anthos-system 11d
node-disk 11d
standard 11d
nfs 11d
To edit a storage profile and change the access mode or volume mode, complete
the following steps:
Edit the StorageProfile custom resource for editing:
kubectl edit storageprofile STORAGE_PROFILE_NAME
Replace STORAGE_PROFILE_NAME with the StorageProfile
you want to edit.
Add a single entry to the spec.claimPropertySets list of the
StorageProfile :
apiVersion : cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind : StorageProfile
metadata :
name : nfs
spec :
claimPropertySets :
- accessModes :
- ACCESS_MODE
volumeMode : VOLUME_MODE
The accessMode and volumeMode use the underlying Kubernetes components.
The values you set depend on the storage driver you use. Replace the following
values as appropriate for the storage you use:
ACCESS_MODE : the access mode that you want to use. If
supported by the associated StorageClass , the preferred access mode is
ReadWriteMany .
Acceptable values include ReadWriteOnce , ReadOnlyMany ,
ReadWriteMany , and ReadWriteOncePod . If not specified, ReadWriteOnce
is used based on the VM Runtime on GDC defaults. For more
information, see
Access modes .
VOLUME_MODE : the volume mode that you want to use.
Acceptable values include Filesystem and Block . If not specified,
Filesystem is used based on the Kubernetes defaults. For more
information, see
Volume modes .
Note: The access mode and volume mode must be supported by the underlying
StorageClass .
Save and close the StorageProfile custom resource in your editor.
The storage profile settings you defined are used when you now create any
virtual disks. Existing VirtualMachineDisk resources are not updated to use
the defined storage profile settings.
