Create a Windows VM from ISO image in Google Distributed Cloud
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows you how to create a Windows virtual machine (VM) that boots
from an ISO using VM Runtime on GDC. When the VM boots, you manually
complete the Windows setup routine.
You can also create a Windows VM from a prepared disk image
using an HTTP source
or
from Cloud Storage .
Before you begin
To complete this document, you need access to the following resources:
Access to Google Distributed Cloud version 1.12.0 ( anthosBareMetalVersion: 1.12.0 )
or higher cluster. You can use any cluster type capable of running workloads.
If needed,
try Google Distributed Cloud on Compute Engine
or see the
cluster creation overview .
The virtctl client tool installed as a plugin for kubectl . If needed,
install the virtctl client tool .
Create a virtual disk for the ISO image
To successfully create a Windows VM, follow the steps and sections in this
document in order.
To boot from a Windows ISO image, first create a VirtualMachineDisk with
diskType of cdrom . Use your Windows ISO as the source for this disk.
Create a VirtualMachineDisk manifest, such as windows-iso.yaml , in the
editor of your choice:
nano windows-iso.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachineDisk
metadata :
name : windows-iso
spec :
source :
http :
url : IMG_URL
size : 10Gi
diskType : cdrom
Replace IMG_URL with the HTTP path to your Windows ISO.
You can also
create and use credentials to import an ISO from Cloud Storage .
Save and close the manifest in your editor.
Create the VirtualMachineDisk using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f windows-iso.yaml
Create a VM drivers disk
To successfully boot from a Windows ISO and complete the install process, the
VM needs access to the
virtio drivers . To provide the virtio drivers to the VM,
complete the following steps:
Create a VirtualMachineDisk manifest, such as virtio-driver.yaml , in the
editor of your choice:
nano virtio-driver.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachineDisk
metadata :
name : virtio-driver
spec :
size : 1Gi
source :
registry :
url : docker://quay.io/kubevirt/virtio-container-disk:latest
diskType : cdrom
This manifest pulls the latest virtio drivers from a public Docker repo and
sets the diskType as cdrom . Your VM uses this disk during the install
process.
Save and close the manifest in your editor.
Create the VirtualMachineDisk using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f virtio-driver.yaml
Create a Windows VM
Create a VM that boots from the Windows ISO VirtualMachineDisk , and attaches
the virtio drivers disk:
Create a manifest that defines a VirtualMachineDisk for the boot volume and
a VirtualMachine , such as windows-vm.yaml , in the editor of your choice:
nano windows-vm.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachineDisk
metadata :
name : VM_NAME -boot-dv
spec :
size : 100Gi
---
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : VM_NAME
spec :
osType : Windows
disks :
- virtualMachineDiskName : VM_NAME -boot-dv
boot : true
- virtualMachineDiskName : windows-iso
- virtualMachineDiskName : virtio-driver
compute :
cpu :
vcpus : 2
memory :
capacity : 4Gi
interfaces :
- name : eth0
networkName : pod-network
Replace VM_NAME with the name that you want for your VM.
This manifest creates a 100 Gibibyte (GiB) boot volume. As this boot volume is empty
when the VM first starts, the VM boots from ISO as a CD-ROM device to start
the setup routine. The virtio drivers are also attached to complete the
install process.
Save and close the manifest in your editor.
Create the VirtualMachineDisk and VirtualMachine using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f windows-vm.yaml
Connect to Windows VM and complete OS install
The VM starts and boots from the Windows ISO in the previous section. Connect to
your VM and complete the Windows install process and configure your VM:
Connect to your Windows VM:
kubectl virt vnc VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of your Windows VM.
When prompted, enter your
Windows guest OS user credentials for your VM.
For more information about using kubectl virt vnc to connect to your VM, see
Connect directly using VNC .
In the Windows setup, choose to perform a Custom install .
Select Load driver , browse to the viostor directory on the virtio
disk, then select the directory that matches the version of Windows you want
to install.
For more information, see
KubeVirt Windows virtio drivers .
With the storage and network drivers from virtio now available, complete
the rest of the Windows install process.
We recommend that you enable Remote Desktop Protocol so you can connect
directly to the VM after install.
Detach the ISO image and drivers disk
After the Windows install is complete, remove the virtio drivers disk and
Windows ISO image from the VM:
Stop your Windows VM:
kubectl virt stop VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of your Windows VM.
Use kubectl to edit the VM:
kubectl edit gvm VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of your Windows VM.
In your editor, update the spec.disks section to remove the Windows ISO and
virtio disks, as shown in the following example. The only disk left attached
to the VM should be the VM_NAME -boot-dv :
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : windows-vm
spec :
osType : Windows
disks :
- virtualMachineDiskName : windows-vm-boot-dv
boot : true
interfaces :
...
Save and close the VM manifest.
Start your Windows VM:
kubectl virt start VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of your Windows VM.
Check the STATUS of your VM:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of your Windows VM.
Make sure that your VM is in a Running state. If the VM isn't in a Running
state, check your VirtualMachine resource manifest to make sure you only
removed the Windows ISO and virtio disk. Check that the host has enough
compute resources to start your VM.
