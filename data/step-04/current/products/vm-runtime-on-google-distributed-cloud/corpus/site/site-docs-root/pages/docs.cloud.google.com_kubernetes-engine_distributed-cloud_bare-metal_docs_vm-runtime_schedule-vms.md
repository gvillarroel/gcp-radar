This document is intended for application owners and platform administrators
that run Google Distributed Cloud. This document shows you how to use schedule
configurations such as affinity and anti-affinity for VMs that use
VM Runtime on GDC.
Before you begin
To complete this document, you need access to the following resources:
Access to Google Distributed Cloud version 1.12.0 ( anthosBareMetalVersion: 1.12.0 )
or higher cluster. You can use any cluster type capable of running workloads.
If needed,
try Google Distributed Cloud on Compute Engine
or see the
cluster creation overview .
The virtctl client tool installed as a plugin for kubectl . If needed,
install the virtctl client tool .
Note: The VirtualMachine manifests in this document use the default
networking configuration. For more information about VM networking, see
Create and use virtual networks for VM Runtime on GDC .
Schedule configurations overview
Schedule configurations are optional values in VM Runtime on GDC. If
no scheduling configuration is specified, the VM defaults to Kubernetes default
scheduling behavior.
With the default scheduling behavior, VMs are spread across your cluster. The
scheduler looks at the current node resource availability, such as CPU and
memory, and schedules VMs on nodes to distribute the compute demands. If you
have no specific requirements, you don't need to define any schedule
configurations.
The following three fields are available to schedule VMs:
nodeSelector : specifies node labels that the host node of a VM must have.
VM Runtime on GDC schedules the VM only on those nodes that have a
specified label.
Affinity: specifies the affinity rules of the VM. It includes node
affinity and inter-VM affinity or anti-affinity. You define a soft or hard
requirement for the scheduler:
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution : is a soft requirement.
The scheduler tries to honor your request. If the scheduler can't honor the
request, the VM may be scheduled on an unpreferred node.
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution : is a hard requirement. The
scheduler tries to honor your request. If no nodes are available that
match your requirement, the VM is not scheduled.
Tolerations : allows the VM to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.
You can define any of these scheduling configurations to support your compute
workloads and scheduling needs. In addition to scheduling configurations, VM
scheduling is contingent upon available resources.
Note: To update scheduling configurations on existing VMs, the VM must first be
in a Stopped state. After you make changes, start the VM. The scheduler uses
the new configuration to run the VM on an appropriate nodes. For more
information, see
manage the powers state of a VM .
VM Runtime on GDC uses the same VM scheduling logic and manifest
structure as Kubernetes to
assign Pods to Nodes .
For more information on these scheduling configurations, see the following
links:
nodeSelector
Affinity and anti-affinity
Taints and tolerations
Put VMs on a specific node
If you have nodes with specific hardware configurations, you can schedule VMs
to only run on these nodes. For example, your VM might want a particular CPU
chipset, or need GPU support. You can use a basic nodeSelector , or more
flexible affinity rules, to schedule VMs to run on these nodes.
nodeSelector
The following VirtualMachine manifest uses a nodeSelector for a hard
scheduling requirement. If no node is available that meets the scheduling
configuration, the VM can't be scheduled.
Create a VirtualMachine manifest, such as my-scheduled-vm.yaml, in
the editor of your choice:
nano my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : VM_NAME
spec :
interfaces :
- name : eth0
networkName : pod-network
default : true
disks :
- virtualMachineDiskName : VM_NAME -boot-dv
boot : true
scheduling :
nodeSelector :
kubernetes.io/hostname : NODE_NAME
Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : the name of your VM.
NODE_NAME : the node(s) that you want to
schedule your VM on.
The boot disk named
VM_NAME -boot-dv must already exist.
For more information, see
Create a VM boot disk .
Save and close the VM manifest in your editor.
Create the VM and schedule configuration using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Affinity
The following VirtualMachine manifest uses affinity for a soft scheduling
requirement. The scheduler tries to honor your request. If the scheduler can't
honor the request, the VM is scheduled on an unpreferred node.
Create a VirtualMachine manifest, such as my-scheduled-vm.yaml, in the
editor of your choice:
nano my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : VM_NAME
spec :

Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : the name of your VM.
NODE_NAME : the node(s) that you want to
schedule your VM on.
The boot disk named
VM_NAME -boot-dv must already exist.
For more information, see
Create a VM boot disk .
Note: For a hard scheduling requirement, set
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution rather than
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution .
Save and close the VM manifest in your editor.
Create the VM and schedule configuration using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Don't put VMs on a specific node
Certain VMs might have workloads that don't run on a particular node. You can
use anti-affinity rules to avoid scheduling VMs on these nodes.
The following VirtualMachine manifest uses affinity for a soft scheduling
requirement. The scheduler tries to honor your request. If the scheduler can't
honor the request, the VM may be scheduled on an inappropriate node.
Create a VirtualMachine manifest, such as my-scheduled-vm.yaml, in the
editor of your choice:
nano my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : V VM_NAME

requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution rather than
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution .
Save and close the VM manifest in your editor.
Create the VM and schedule configuration using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Keep VMs apart
Your compute workloads might have VMs that should be spread across nodes for
high availability, such as a pool of frontend VMs. You can use inter-VM
anti-affinity rules to avoid scheduling VMs together on nodes.
The following VirtualMachine manifest uses affinity for a soft scheduling
requirement. The scheduler tries to honor your request. If the scheduler can't
honor the request, the VM may be scheduled on an inappropriate node.
Create a VirtualMachine manifest, such as my-scheduled-vm.yaml, in the
editor of your choice:
nano my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : VM_NAME
labels :
KEY:VALUE
spec :
interfaces :
- name : eth0

labelSelector :
matchLabels :
KEY:VALUE
Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : the name of your VM.
KEY:VALUE : the key:value label to apply to your VMs that you want to
schedule across different nodes. For more information, see
Labels and selectors .
The boot disk named VM_NAME -boot-dv must
already exist. For more information, see
Create a VM boot disk .
Note: For a hard scheduling requirement, set
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution rather than
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution .
Save and close the VM manifest in your editor.
Create the VM and schedule configuration using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Keep VMs together
Your compute workloads might have VMs that should be kept together on nodes to
reduce latency, such as a middleware and database tier. You can use inter-VM
affinity rules to schedule VMs together on nodes.
The following VirtualMachine manifest uses affinity for a soft scheduling
requirement. The scheduler tries to honor your request. If the scheduler can't
honor the request, the VM may be scheduled on an inappropriate node.
Create a VirtualMachine manifest, such as my-scheduled-vm.yaml, in the
editor of your choice:
nano my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : VM_NAME
labels :
KEY:VALUE
spec :
interfaces :
- name : eth0
networkName : pod-network

labelSelector :
matchLabels :
KEY:VALUE
weight : 100
Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : the name of your VM.
KEY:VALUE : the key:value label pair to apply to
your VMs that you want to schedule across different nodes. For more
information, see
Labels and selectors .
The boot disk named VM_NAME -boot-dv must
already exist. For more information, see
Create a VM boot disk .
Note: For a hard scheduling requirement, set
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution rather than
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution .
Save and close the VM manifest in your editor.
Create the VM and schedule configuration using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Schedule VMs on nodes with taints
Taints are a scheduling property that lets nodes only allow VMs with specified
tolerations to be scheduled to run on them. You can apply a taint to a node,
then in the VirtualMachine manifest define a toleration to let the VM run on
the node. For more information, see
Taints and tolerations .
Create a VirtualMachine manifest, such as my-scheduled-vm.yaml, in the
editor of your choice:
nano my-scheduled-vm.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : VM_NAME
spec :
interfaces :
- name : eth0
networkName : pod-network
default : true
disks :
- virtualMachineDiskName : VM_NAME -boot-dv
boot : true
scheduling :
tolerations :
- key : KEY_NAME
operator : "Equal"
value : KEY_VALUE
effect : "NoSchedule"
Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : the name of your VM.
KEY_NAME : the key name of your toleration that
matches the taint on the node.
KEY_VALUE : the value of the key for your toleration
that matches the taint on the node.
