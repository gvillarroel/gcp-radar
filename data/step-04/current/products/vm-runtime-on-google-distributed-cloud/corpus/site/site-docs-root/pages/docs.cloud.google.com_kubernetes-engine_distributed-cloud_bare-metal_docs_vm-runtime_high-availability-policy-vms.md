Configure a high availability policy for VMs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows you how to configure the high-availability policy for
virtual machines (VMs) that run using VM Runtime on GDC.
When you
enable VM Runtime on GDC ,
the cluster creates a VMHighAvailabilityPolicy object named default . This
object specifies the default recovery strategy in case a cluster node that
is running a VM fails. Possible default recovery strategies are:
Reschedule : Reschedule the VM on another cluster node.
Ignore : Do nothing.
Initially, the default recovery strategy is set to Reschedule .
A default recovery strategy of Reschedule is appropriate in the following
situation:
Your cluster has at least two worker nodes.
Your VM disks are provisioned using a network-file-based storage class. That is,
the storage class is based on a network file system that coordinates POSIX
file locks across different clients.
Network File System (NFS)
is an example of a network-file-based storage class.
If your VMs are using local storage or a block-based storage system,
we recommend that you set the default recovery strategy to Ignore . We make
this recommendation for the following reasons:
If your VMs use local storage, and a node fails, there is no
way to recover the stored data and move it to a new node.
If your VMs use a block-based storage system, the storage
might not have sufficient detachment guarantees. That could lead to
concurrent disk access and data corruption during VM scheduling.
Inspect the VMHighAvailabilityPolicy object
Verify that there is a VMHighAvailabilityPolicy object:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get VMHighAvailabilityPolicy --namespace vm-system
Replace USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG with the path of your user cluster
kubeconfig file.
The output shows that there is a VMHighAvailabilityPolicy object named
default . In the output, you can also see the current value of
defaultRecoveryStrategy . For example, the following output shows that the
current value of defaultRecoveryStrategy is Reschedule :
vm-system default 5m55s Reschedule 15s 1m30s
Get a detailed view of the VMHighAvailabilityPolicy object:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get VMHighAvailabilityPolicy \
--namespace vm-system --output yaml
Example output:
apiVersion: vm.cluster.gke.io/v1alpha1
kind: VMHighAvailabilityPolicy
metadata:
...
labels:
app.kubernetes.io/component: kubevirt
app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: virt-operator
kubevirt.io: virt-api
name: default
namespace: vm-system
..
spec:
defaultRecoveryStrategy: Reschedule
nodeHeartbeatInterval: 15s
nodeMonitorGracePeriod: 1m30s
Change the default recovery strategy
In certain situations, we recommend that you change the default recovery
strategy. For example if your VMs are using local storage or a file system that
is not network-file-based, then we recommend that you change the value of
defaultRecoveryStrategy to Ignore .
To change the value of defaultRecoveryStrategy , open the
VMHighAvailabilityPolicy object for editing:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG edit VMHighAvailabilityPolicy \
default --namespace vm-system
In your text editor, change the value of defaultRecoveryStrategy to a value
of your choice: Reschedule or Ignore . Close the text editor.
Override the default recovery strategy for a VM
The default recovery strategy applies to all VMs running in the cluster.
However, you might need to override the default recovery strategy for individual
VMs.
For example, suppose that most of your VMs are provisioned with a
network-file-based storage class, but a few VMs are provisioned with a
block-based storage class. For each VM that uses block-based storage, we
recommend that you override the default recovery strategy by setting the
recovery strategy for the individual VM to Ignore .
To override the default recovery strategy for a VM, add a
vm.cluster.gke.io/vm-ha-recovery-strategy annotation to both the
VirtualMachineInstance (VMI) object and the GVM object.
For example, these commands set the recovery strategy to Ignore for a VM
named my-vm :
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
annotate vmi my-vm \
vm.cluster.gke.io/vm-ha-recovery-strategy=Ignore --overwrite
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
annotate gvm my-vm \
vm.cluster.gke.io/vm-ha-recovery-strategy=Ignore --overwrite
If you want to remove the annotations later, use a hyphen at the end of the
annotation name. For example:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
annotate vmi my-vm \
vm.cluster.gke.io/vm-ha-recovery-strategy-
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
annotate gvm my-vm \
vm.cluster.gke.io/vm-ha-recovery-strategy-
Advanced configuration
In addition to configuring the default recovery strategy, you can configure the
following:
Node heartbeat interval : The time between heartbeats sent by each cluster
node
Node monitor grace period : The maximum amount of time a node can fail to
send a heartbeat before it is considered unhealthy
In most cases, the default values for heartbeat interval and grace period are
appropriate. However, you might choose to adjust these values if you want
to fine tune the tradeoff between speed of recovery and overhead. A shorter
heartbeat interval will shorten recovery time, but will also increase overhead.
In a large cluster, you might choose to lengthen the heartbeat interval, because
frequent heartbeats from many nodes could create an unacceptable load on the
Kubernetes API server.
Keep the heartbeat interval lower than the grace period to avoid cases where a
single missed heartbeat results in a node being deemed unhealthy.
Run kubectl edit to open the VMHighAvailabilityPolicy object for editing. Set
nodeHeartbeatInterval and nodeMonitorGracePeriod to values of your choice.
spec:
defaultRecoveryStrategy: Reschedule
nodeHeartbeatInterval: 15s
nodeMonitorGracePeriod: 1m30s
