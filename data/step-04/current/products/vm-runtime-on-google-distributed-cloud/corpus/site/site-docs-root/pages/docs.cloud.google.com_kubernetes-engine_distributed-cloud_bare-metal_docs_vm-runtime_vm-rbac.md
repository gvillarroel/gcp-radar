VM Runtime on GDC manages a wide range of resources related to your
VMs. These resources include GKE-defined resources, KubeVirt-defined
resources, and Kubernetes resources. VM Runtime on GDC uses
role-based access control (RBAC)
to set and enforce permissions for managed resources. To help you work with
these resources and manage your VMs, we've provided four pre-configured
ClusterRoles:
kubevm.admin
kubevm.edit
kubevm.view
kubevm.cluster.view
These built-in roles provide a generalized access model on the custom resources
related to VM Runtime on GDC. Each role has pre-established permissions
to operate on the resources. This document provides information about resources
VM Runtime on GDC manages so that cluster administrators can customize
their own access model.
Predefined ClusterRoles
This section describes each of the predefined ClusterRoles. These ClusterRoles
are only available when VM Runtime on GDC is enabled:
When VM Runtime on GDC is enabled, the four predefined ClusterRoles
are automatically created.
When VM Runtime on GDC is disabled, the four predefined ClusterRoles
are deleted.
The following table lists the cluster roles and their related permissions:

Aggregated ClusterRoles
The kubevm.admin , kubevm.view , and kubevm.edit ClusterRoles aren't used
directly. Instead, these three roles are aggregated to Kubernetes default
admin , view , and edit ClusterRoles respectively. This aggregation extends
the default Kubernetes roles so they can be used to manage GKE
resources. With
aggregated ClusterRoles ,
you can use Kubernetes default roles to manage access to GKE
resources or create your own roles based on the predefined ClusterRoles.
Example aggregation label
The kubevm.edit ClusterRole has the label
rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true" , which aggregates it to
the Kubernetes edit ClusterRole. The permissions in the kubevm.edit
ClusterRole are granted to the Kubernetes default edit role. The kubevm.admin
and the kubevm.view ClusterRoles are aggregated similarly with
aggregate-to-admin or aggregate-to-view annotations.
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ClusterRole
metadata :
name : kubevm.edit
labels :
kubevm : kubevm.edit
rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit : "true"
...
Typical User Scenarios
The following sections describe how to use
RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding
to grant the permissions specified in the predefined ClusterRoles to a user or
set of users.
Cluster admin
To grant admin permissions to a user or set of users, create a
ClusterRoleBinding with the Kubernetes default admin ClusterRole.
Example ClusterRoleBinding
The following admin-charlie example ClusterRoleBinding gives user charlie
admin permissions. The ClusterRoleBinding uses permissions from the default
Kubernetes admin ClusterRole, which includes permissions from the predefined
kubevm.admin ClusterRole through aggregation.
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ClusterRoleBinding
metadata :
name : admin-charlie
roleRef :
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
kind : ClusterRole
name : admin
subjects :
- apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
kind : User
name : charlie
Cluster viewer
To grant viewer permissions to a user or set of users, create a
ClusterRoleBinding with the Kubernetes default view ClusterRole. See
Example ClusterRoleBinding for a similar
ClusterRoleBinding example.
Cluster editor
To grant editor permissions to a user or set of users, create a
ClusterRoleBinding with the Kubernetes default edit ClusterRole. See
Example ClusterRoleBinding for a similar
ClusterRoleBinding example.
Namespaced editor
To grant namespaced editor permissions to a user or set of users, you need to
create two separate bindings:
Create a RoleBinding on the namespace and reference the default Kubernetes
edit ClusterRole.
Create a ClusterRoleBinding that references the predefined
kubevm.cluster.view ClusterRole. This ClusterRoleBinding is needed, because
some resources, such as virtualmachinetypes and storageclasses , aren't
namespaced.
Role binding examples (namespaced editor)
The following RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding examples give user charlie
editor permissions for resources in the default namespace:
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : RoleBinding
metadata :
name : edit-charlie
namespace : default
roleRef :
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
kind : ClusterRole
name : edit
subjects :
- apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
kind : User
name : charlie
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ClusterRoleBinding
metadata :
name : kubevm-cluster-view-charlie
roleRef :
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
kind : ClusterRole
name : kubevm.cluster.view
subjects :
- apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
kind : User
name : charlie
Namespaced viewer
To grant namespaced viewer permissions to a user or set of users, you need to
create two separate bindings:
Create a RoleBinding on the namespace and reference the default Kubernetes
view ClusterRole.
Create a ClusterRoleBinding that references the predefined
kubevm.cluster.view ClusterRole.
See Role binding examples (namespaced editor) for
similar RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding examples.
Resources used by VM Runtime on GDC
The following sections contain tables of resources used by
VM Runtime on GDC. These sections are for informational purposes only.
If you plan to use predefined roles in the typical user scenarios described in
the preceding sections, there's no specific use for this information.
If, however, you don't want to use the predefined roles, you can use this
resource information to create your own, customized roles.
Google Kubernetes Engine-defined resources
The predefined ClusterRoles focus on access to GKE-defined
resources. The following table lists the GKE resources and the
access permissions granted by each of the predefined ClusterRoles.

KubeVirt resources
VM Runtime on GDC is based on the
KubeVirt open source project . By default,
the permissions for the KubeVirt resources are automatically aggregated to the
default Kubernetes roles, similar to the GKE-managed resources. Use
the resource information in the following table if you want to create your own,
customized roles:

access to the following Kubernetes resources. Use the resource information in

ClusterRole YAML examples
You can retrieve YAML for the ClusterRoles with the following kubectl command:
kubectl get ClusterRole CLUSTERROLE_NAME -o yaml --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG_PATH
Replace the following:
CLUSTERROLE_NAME : the name of
the ClusterRole, such as kubevm.cluster.view .
KUBECONFIG_PATH : the path to the
kubeconfig file for the cluster.
Here are examples of the command output for each of the four predefined
ClusterRoles:
