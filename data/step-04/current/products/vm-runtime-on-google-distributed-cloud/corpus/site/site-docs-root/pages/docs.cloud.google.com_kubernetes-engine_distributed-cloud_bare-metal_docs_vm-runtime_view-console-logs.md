View console logs for VMs that use VM Runtime on GDC
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document is intended for application owners that run Google Distributed Cloud.
This document shows you how to view console logs for virtual machine (VM) that
use VM Runtime on GDC. You can use the VM console logs to
troubleshoot and diagnose problems in your cluster.
Before you begin
To complete this document, you need access to the following resources:
A VM that runs in one of your clusters. If needed,
create a VM in Google Distributed Cloud .
The virtctl client tool installed as a plugin for kubectl . If needed,
install the virtctl client tool .
Connect to VM
To make sure there are logs to review, connect to your VM and generate some log
activity.
To access a VM from the console, use kubectl :
kubectl virt console VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM that you want to
connect to.
When prompted, enter the user credentials you specified when you created the
VM.
Run a command to check for updates, such as apt-get for Debian-based VMs
or yum check-update for Red Hat-based VMs.
Debian-based
apt-get update
Red Hat-based
yum check-update
After you have successfully generated some console log activity, exit the VM
session and console:
Ctrl + ]
View VM console logs
You view VM console logs in the Google Cloud console. VM serial console logs
are streamed to Cloud Logging and can be viewed in Logs Explorer. VMs
that run using VM Runtime on GDC are classed as containers in the
console logs.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Logs Explorer page in the
Logging menu.
Go to Logs Explorer
In the Query field, enter the following basic query:
resource . type = "k8s_container"
resource . labels . container_name = "log"
The Query results window shows the output of the console logs from
your VMs, as shown in the following example screenshot:
You can further filter the results of your query to a particular VM by adding
the cluster name and the name of the VM to your query:
resource . type = "k8s_container"
resource . labels . container_name = "log"
resource . labels . cluster_name = " CLUSTER_NAME "
labels . k8s - pod / kubevirt / vm = " VM_NAME "
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME :
the name of the cluster that contains your VM.
VM_NAME : the name of your VM.
