This document is intended for IT administrators, Operators, and
Networking specialists who run Google Distributed Cloud. This document shows you
how to create and use virtual networks to support VM workloads that use
VM Runtime on GDC. To learn more about common roles and example
tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before you begin
To complete this document, you need access to the following resources:
Access to Google Distributed Cloud version 1.12.0 ( anthosBareMetalVersion: 1.12.0 )
or higher cluster. You can use any cluster type capable of running workloads.

Virtual networks overview
Networks are created using custom resources. A network can be created at any
time after your cluster is created. Network settings for the host interface and
VLAN ID assignment, if defined, can't be changed after you create a network.
The deletion of networks is subject to some conditions. For example, the
network controller rejects the deletion of a network when it's in use by any
resources, such as VMs or network interfaces.
The network definition can include the gateway, routes, and DNS information.
You can also enable the use of an external DHCP server. These network settings
are statically or dynamically assigned depending on how certain network
configurations options are defined.
Default pod-network
Each cluster has a pod-network created by default for you. This network can't
be changed. Routes for the pod CIDR and service CIDR, and DNS configuration are
automatically populated. The DNS configuration uses the same values as the
cluster.
The pod-network can be used by workloads that need an interface to access the
pod network of the cluster and don't need any specific configuration options.
The routes of the pod-network are always configured to ensure the cluster and
service access for the workloads, even though the default gateway is not on the
pod-network interface.
This default pod-network lets you test VM Runtime on GDC without
additional steps to create your own virtual networks. Many of our docs use this
default pod-network to reduce the complexity of the examples. The needs of
your VM workloads determine if this default pod-network is sufficient, or if
you need to create and use your own virtual networks.
Note: You typically wouldn't use this default pod-network for production
traffic. Instead, you would create and use your own virtual networks, as shown
in the rest of this document. You define IP address ranges, routes, and VLANs in
your own networks, which aren't possible in the default pod-network .
The following YAML manifest shows a sample configuration for the pod-network .
Values for routes, DNS, and the interface name have been populated by the
cluster:
​​apiVersion : networking.gke.io/v1
kind : Network
metadata :
name : pod-network
spec :
routes :
- to : 192.168.0.0/16
- to : 10.96.0.0/12
dnsConfig :
nameservers :
- 10.96.0.10
Create and use virtual networks
To support production workloads, create networks that support the features you
need, such as the use of an external DHCP server or the use of a VLAN ID. These
networks provide layer 2 (L2) connectivity for your VMs.
Use an external DHCP server
VM Runtime on GDC doesn't provide DHCP servers. You must manually
specify IP addresses for VMs or configure the use of external DHCP servers. When
you enable the use of an external DHCP server, you can skip configuration of DNS
and gateway settings if they're provided by DHCP.
To create a network that uses an external DHCP server, complete the following
steps:
Create a Network manifest, such as use-dhcp-network.yaml , in the editor
of your choice:
nano use-dhcp-network.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : networking . gke . io / v1
kind : Network
metadata :
name : NETWORK_NAME
spec :
type : L2
nodeInterfaceMatcher :
interfaceName : INTERFACE_NAME
externalDHCP4 : true
Replace the following values:
NETWORK_NAME : the name for your network.
INTERFACE_NAME : the interface name on your
Google Distributed Cloud node to attach the network to. Specify the name of the
physical interface on your node to use. All nodes in your cluster should
have the same interface name.
In this Network manifest, the following values are set:
type is set to L2 . With this setting, workloads can only have a
Layer 2 attachment to this network. This is the only network type that
you can create in VM Runtime on GDC.
externalDHCP4 is set to true . This setting enables external DHCP for
the network. The external DHCP server is responsible for IPv4 address
allocation, routes, gateway, and DNS configuration for workloads connected
to this network.
Save and close the Network manifest in your editor.
Create the network using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f use-dhcp-network.yaml
Manually define network settings
VM Runtime on GDC doesn't provide DHCP servers. You must manually
specify IP addresses for VMs or configure the use of external DHCP servers. If
you manually specify IP addresses, you must define network settings for DNS,
routes, and default gateway.
To create a network with manually-specified networking settings for VMs,
complete the following steps:
Create a Network manifest, such as manual-network.yaml , in the editor of
your choice:
nano manual-network.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : networking . gke . io / v1
kind : Network
metadata :
name : NETWORK_NAME
spec :
type : L2
nodeInterfaceMatcher :
interfaceName : INTERFACE_NAME
routes :
- to : " ROUTE_ADDRESS "
gateway4 : GATEWAY_ADDRESS
dnsConfig :
nameservers :
- NAMESERVER_ADDRESS
Replace the following values:
NETWORK_NAME : the name for your network.
INTERFACE_NAME : the interface name on your
Google Distributed Cloud node to attach the network to. Specify the name of the
physical interface on your node to use. All nodes in your cluster should
have the same interface name.
ROUTE_ADDRESS : optional routes in CIDR notation to
configure on every VM that connects to this network.
GATEWAY_ADDRESS : the gateway IP address for your VMs to
use.
NAMESERVER_ADDRESS : one or more DNS nameserver IP
addresses for your VMs to use.
Save and close the Network manifest in your editor.
Create the network using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f manual-network.yaml
Use a VLAN ID
When you create virtual networks, you can define tagged VLANs. These VLAN
assignments help you isolate network traffic based on your workload requirements
and isolation needs. In an AnthosManaged network, the cluster has permission
to create and delete the VLAN interface on every node.
To create a network that defines a VLAN assignment, complete the following
steps:
Create a Network manifest, such as vlan-network.yaml , in the editor of
your choice:
nano vlan-network.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : networking . gke . io / v1
kind : Network
metadata :
name : NETWORK_NAME
spec :
type : L2
networkLifecycle : AnthosManaged
l2NetworkConfig :
vlanID : VLAN_ID
nodeInterfaceMatcher :
interfaceName : INTERFACE_NAME
externalDHCP4 : true
Replace the following values:
NETWORK_NAME : the name for your network.
INTERFACE_NAME : the interface name on your
Google Distributed Cloud node to attach the network to. Specify the name of the
physical interface on your node to use. All nodes in your cluster should
have the same interface name.
VLAN_ID : the VLAN ID you want to tag traffic for.
In this Network manifest, the following values are set:
Workloads can have only an L2 attachment to this network.
The network is AnthosManaged . This setting is the default lifecycle if
not specified.
In this mode, the cluster has permission to create and delete the VLAN
interface on every node, such as INTERFACE_NAME . VLAN_ID .
If you want to create, or have already created, the VLAN interfaces on
the nodes, set the networkLifecycle value to UserManaged as shown
in the next section.
The network has external DHCP enabled. The external DHCP server is
responsible for IPv4 address allocation, routes, gateway, and DNS
configuration for workloads connected to this network.
Save and close the Network manifest in your editor.
Create the network using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f vlan-network.yaml
Create a user-managed network
In the following example virtual network, the network is user-managed , as
opposed to Anthos-managed in a previous example. In user-managed networks,
you're responsible for creating or deleting the VLAN interface on the host.
To create a network in a user-managed mode and manually define the VLAN
interface configuration, complete the following steps:
Create a Network manifest, such as user-managed-network.yaml , in the
editor of your choice:
nano user-managed-network.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML definition:
apiVersion : networking . gke . io / v1
kind : Network
metadata :
name : NETWORK_NAME
spec :
type : L2
networkLifecycle : UserManaged
l2NetworkConfig :
vlanID : VLAN_ID
nodeInterfaceMatcher :
interfaceName : INTERFACE_NAME
externalDHCP4 : true
Replace the following values:
NETWORK_NAME : the name for your network.
INTERFACE_NAME : the host interface to attach the
network to.
VLAN_ID : the VLAN ID you want to tag traffic for.
In this Network manifest, the following values are set:
Workloads can have only an L2 attachment to this network.
The network is UserManaged . You must create or delete the VLAN
VLAN_ID interface on every node before
the network is created, or after the network is deleted.
The network has external DHCP enabled. The external DHCP server is
responsible for IPv4 address allocation, routes, gateway, and DNS
configuration for workloads connected to this network.
Save and close the Network manifest in your editor.
Create the network using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f user-managed-network.yaml
Connect a VM to a network
Network settings for your VM such as DNS and DHCP are statically or dynamically
assigned depending on how certain network configurations options are defined:
If you configure a static IP address on the VM, no query is sent to a DHCP
server. Additional information to configure the gateway and route must come
from the network resource.
If you don't configure a static IP address on the VM, a query is sent to the
DHCP server. The VM gets all information from the DHCP server and ignores any
configuration you define in the network resource.
If external DHCP isn't set to true in the network resource, you must
configure a static IP address for the VM. All other information comes from the
configuration you define in network resource.
To create a VM that connects to a network, complete the following steps:
CLI
To create a VM using kubectl , complete the following steps:
kubectl virt create vm VM_NAME \
--image ubuntu20.04 \
--network NETWORK_NAME
Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : the name for your VM.
NETWORK_NAME : the name of your network to connect
to.
If the network is configured to allow the use of external DHCP
servers, the VM gets an IP address assignment automatically. If you
need to define a static IP address, add the optional
--ip IP_ADDRESS parameter and value.
Note: In the ~/google-virtctl directory, a
VM_NAME .yaml file is created. You can
view the content of this file to see the definition of the Kubernetes
resources that were created by the VM Runtime on GDC.
Manifest
To create a VM using a YAML manifest, complete the following steps:
Create a VirtualMachine manifest, such as my-vm.yaml , in the editor of
your choice:
nano my-vm.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : VM_NAME
spec :
interfaces :
- name : eth0
networkName : NETWORK_NAME
ipAddresses :
- IP_ADDRESS
default : true
disks :
- virtualMachineDiskName : VM_NAME -boot-dv
boot : true
In this YAML manifest, define the following settings:
VM_NAME : the name for your VM.
NETWORK_NAME : the name of your network to connect
to.
IP_ADDRESS : the IP address in CIDR notation to
assign to your VM, such as 192.0.2.10/24 .
If your network is configured to allow the use of external DHCP
servers, remove this field from the VirtualMachine manifest.
The boot disk named VM_NAME -boot-dv must already
exist. For more information, see
Create a VM boot disk .
Save and close the VirtualMachine manifest in your editor.
Create the VM using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-vm.yaml
