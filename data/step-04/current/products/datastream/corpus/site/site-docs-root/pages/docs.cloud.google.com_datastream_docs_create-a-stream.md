Create a stream
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In this section, you learn how to create a stream. Datastream uses this stream to transfer data from a source Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or Spanner database into BigQuery or Cloud Storage.
Creating a stream includes:
Defining settings for the stream.
Selecting the connection profile that you created for your Oracle , MySQL , SQL Server , PostgreSQL , Spanner , MongoDB or Salesforce or source (the source connection profile), or creating a source connection profile if you haven't created one.
Configuring information about the source database for the stream by specifying the tables and schemas in the source database that Datastream:
Can transfer into the destination.
Is restricted from transferring into the destination.
Determining whether Datastream will backfill historical data, as well as stream ongoing changes into the destination, or stream only changes to the data. When enabling historical backfill, you can optionally specify schemas and tables in the source database that Datastream shouldn't backfill into the destination.
Selecting the connection profile that you created for
BigQuery
or
Cloud Storage
(the destination connection profile), or creating a destination connection
profile if you haven't created one.
Configuring information about the destination for the stream. This information includes:
For BigQuery:
The datasets into which Datastream will replicate schemas, tables, and data from a source database.
For Cloud Storage:
The folder of the destination bucket into which Datastream will transfer schemas, tables, and data from a source database.
Validating the stream to ensure that it will run successfully. Validating a stream checks:
Whether the source is configured properly to allow Datastream to stream data from it.
Whether the stream can connect to both the source and the destination.
The end-to-end configuration of the stream.
Datastream comes equipped with a wizard to help you create a stream. This wizard consists of six panels: Get started, Define & test source, Configure source, Define destination, Configure destination, and Review & create. Information on how to populate each panel is provided in the various sections of this page.
Before you begin
Make sure that you've set up your source database for replication. For
information about steps required for each supported source type, see
Configure sources .
Find out what steps might be required to set up your selected destination.
For more information, see Configure destinations .
Define settings for the stream
Go to the Streams page in the Google Cloud Console.
Go to the Streams page
Click CREATE STREAM .
Use the following table to populate the fields of the Define stream details section of the Create stream page:
Field Description
Stream name Enter the display name of the stream.
Stream ID Datastream populates this field automatically based on the stream name that you enter. You can keep the ID that's auto-generated or change it.
Region Select the region where the stream is stored. Streams, like all resources, are saved in a region. Region selection doesn't impact whether your stream can connect to the source database or the destination, but can impact availability if the region experiences downtime. We recommend that you keep all resources for the stream in the same region as your source data to optimize cost and performance.
Source type Select the profile type that you specified when you created a connection profile for your Oracle , MySQL , SQL Server , PostgreSQL , Spanner , Salesforce source or MongoDB source. Or, if you haven't created a connection profile for the source database, you can create one now.
Destination type Select the profile type that you specified when you created a connection profile for a BigQuery or Cloud Storage destination. Or, if you haven't created a connection profile for the destination, you can create one now.
Encryption By default, your data is encrypted with a key that's managed by Google Cloud. If you want to manage your encryption, then you can use a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK):
Select the Cloud KMS key checkbox.
From the Key type drop-down menu, select Cloud KMS and then select your CMEK.
If you don't see your key, then click ENTER KEY RESOURCE NAME to provide the resource name of the key that you want to use. For example, you can enter projects/ my-project-name /locations/ my-location /keyRings/ my-keyring /cryptoKeys/ my-key in the Key resource name field, and then click SAVE .
As part of creating the stream, Datastream will verify that the CMEK exists, and that Datastream has permissions to use the key. For more information about creating a CMEK or giving Datastream permissions for the key, see Use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) .
Optionally, use labels to organize your Datastream resources.
To create a label, click ADD LABEL , and then enter the key-value pair for the label.
To remove the label, click the trashcan icon to the right of the row that contains the label.
Note: If your source is SQL Server, you can configure your stream to replicate columns added to the source schema after the stream
is created by adding the enable_ddl_support_for_ct label. For more information, see How Datastream handles DDL changes to the source schema .
Optionally, add alerting policies for your stream. Alerting policies define when and how you want to be notified about stream failures.
To create an alerting policy, click Add alerting policy .
The Create alerting policy page appears in Cloud Monitoring. On this page, you define the alerting policy in case your stream fails.
For more information about alerting policies, see Managing metric-based alerting policies .
Review the required prerequisites that are generated automatically to reflect how the environment must be prepared for a stream. These prerequisites can include how to configure the source database and how to connect it to the destination. It's best to complete these prerequisites at this step, but you can complete them at any time before you test the stream or start it. For more information about these prerequisites, see Sources .
Click CONTINUE . The Define connection profile panel of the Create stream page appears for your source database type.
Note: If your source database type is Oracle, then the panel name is Define Oracle connection profile . If you select a different source database, then that database name appears in the panel name.
Specify information about the source connection profile
If you have created a source connection profile for Oracle , MySQL , SQL Server , PostgreSQL , Spanner , Salesforce or MongoDB , then select it from the list of connection profiles.
If you haven't created a source connection profile, then create one by clicking CREATE CONNECTION PROFILE at the bottom of the drop-down list, and then perform the same steps as in Create connection profiles .
Click RUN TEST to verify that the source database and Datastream can communicate with each other.
If the test fails, then the issue associated with the connection profile appears. Refer to the Diagnose issues page for troubleshooting steps. Make the necessary changes to correct the issue, and then retest.
Click CONTINUE . The Configure stream source panel of the Create stream page appears.
Configure information about the source database for the stream
Configure a PostgreSQL source database
Define replication properties for your PostgreSQL source database. In the Replication properties section, specify the following properties:
In the Replication slot name field, enter the name of the slot you created specifically for this stream. The database server uses this slot to send events to Datastream.
In the Publication name field, enter the name of the publication you created in the database. A publication is a group of all tables that you want to replicate changes from using this stream.
In the Select objects to include section, use the Objects to include drop-down menu to specify the tables and schemas in the source database that Datastream can transfer into the destination.
The menu fails to load the list of tables and schemas if your database has more than 5,000 objects.
If you want Datastream to transfer all tables and schemas, then select All tables from all schemas .
If you want Datastream to transfer only specific tables and schemas, select Specific schemas and tables , and then select the checkboxes for the schemas and tables that you want Datastream to pull.
For each schema that you select, there's a Future tables checkbox.
If this checkbox is selected, then any tables for the schema that you add to the source after the stream is created will be transferred into the destination automatically.
If this checkbox isn't selected, then after the stream is created, Datastream won't transfer any new tables for the schema from the source into the destination.
By default, the Future tables checkbox is selected for each schema.
For each schema table that you select, there's a SELECT COLUMNS button. Click this button to filter any columns of the table that you want to exclude from being streamed from the source into the destination. Any columns that you clear are excluded from the stream.
By default, the checkboxes for all columns of the table are selected.
If you want to provide a textual definition of the tables and schemas that you want Datastream to transfer, select Custom , and then, in the Object matching criteria field, enter the schemas and tables that you want Datastream to pull.
If your database has large numbers of tables and schemas, we recommend using the Custom option because some tables and schemas might not be included in the list of objects to pull.
Enter schemas and tables as a comma-separated list, using the [schema].[table] format, where both the schema and the table can be a wildcard (asterisk). You can't use partial wildcards.
If your destination is BigQuery, you can configure partitioning and clustering for your tables:
For each table that you want to set partitioning or clustering,
click Select columns .
To configure partitioning, in the Partitioning section, select one
of the following options:
No partitioning : when you select this option, no partitioning
is applied to your tables.
Partitioning by ingestion time : when you select this option,
data is organized into time-based partitions. Select a value from
the Partitioning type list to configure the partitioning granularity with available options being hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly. Daily is the default granularity.
Partitioning by field : when you select this option, you need to
select the source column by which you want to partition your table, and the
partitioning type. Only source columns with supported data types can be selected.
For information about supported source data types and available partitioning types, see
Configure partitioning and clustering for a BigQuery destination .
Optionally, select the Partitioning filter option. If you select this option, a
partition filter is required on all queries for this table. A partition filter can reduce
cost and improve performance. For more information,
see Set partition filter requirements .
You can use partitioning filters only in the append-only write mode.
To configure clustering, in the Clustering section, select the fields by which you want to cluster your table. You can select up to four fields. The order in which you add the clustering fields determines the sort order of the data. If you don't specify clustering settings for a table, Datastream defaults to using up to four primary keys from the source table as the clustering keys in BigQuery.
Partitioning and clustering are only applied to new tables in BigQuery. If you want to configure or modify
partitioning and clustering settings for a table that already exists, first delete it from BigQuery, and then configure or modify
its settings in Datastream.
Click Save to save your settings.
For more information about partitioning and clustering, see Configure partitioning and clustering .
Optionally, expand the Select objects to exclude node. In the Objects to exclude field, enter the tables and schemas in the source database that you want to restrict Datastream from pulling. The Objects to exclude list takes precedence over the Objects to include list. If an object meets the criteria in both the include and exclude lists, the object is excluded from the stream.
You define these schemas and tables with the same comma-separated logic that you use if you're specifying schemas and tables that you want Datastream to pull.
Optionally, expand the Choose backfill mode for historical data node, and then make one of the following selections:
Select the Automatic option to stream all existing data, in addition to changes to the data, from the source into the destination. In the Objects excluded from automatic backfill field, enter the tables and schemas in the source database that you want to restrict Datastream from backfilling into the destination.
Select the Manual option to stream only changes to the data into the destination.
Click CONTINUE . The Define connection profile panel of the Create stream page appears for your destination type.

If you want to provide a textual definition of the collections that you want Datastream to transfer, select Custom , and then, in the Object matching criteria field, enter the collections that you want Datastream to pull. Enter the objects as a comma-separated list, using the [collection].[field] format.
If your database has large numbers of objects, we recommend using the Custom option because some tables and schemas might not be included in the list of objects to pull.
If your destination is BigQuery, you can configure partitioning for your collections:
For each collection that you want to set partitioning, click
Select fields .
In the Partitioning section, select one
of the following options:
No partitioning : when you select this option, no partitioning
is applied to your collections.
Partitioning by ingestion time : when you select this option,
data is organized into time-based partitions. Select a value from
the Partitioning type list to configure the partitioning granularity with available options being hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly. Daily is the default granularity.
Optionally, select the Partitioning filter option. If you select this option, a
partition filter is required on all queries for this collection. A partition filter can reduce
cost and improve performance. For more information,
see Set partition filter requirements .
You can use partitioning filters only in the append-only write mode.
Partitioning is only applied to new tables in BigQuery. If you want to configure or modify
partitioning settings for a table that already exists, first delete it from BigQuery, and then configure or modify
its settings in Datastream.
Click Save to save your settings.
For more information about partitioning and clustering, see Partition and cluster BigQuery tables .
Optionally, expand the Choose backfill mode for historical data node, and then make one of the following selections:
Select the Automatic option to replicate all existing data, in addition to changes to the data, from the source into the destination. In the Objects excluded from automatic backfill field, enter the objects in the source org that you want to restrict Datastream from backfilling into the destination.
Select the Manual option to replicate only changes to the data into the destination.
Click CONTINUE . The Define connection profile panel of the Create stream page appears for your destination type.
Configure a Spanner source database
In the Select objects to include section, use the Objects to include drop-down menu to specify the tables and schemas in the source database that Datastream can transfer into the destination.
The menu fails to load the list of tables and schemas if your database has more than 5,000 objects.
If you want Datastream to transfer all tables and schemas, then select All tables from all schemas .
If you want Datastream to transfer only specific tables and schemas, select Specific schemas and tables , and then select the checkboxes for the schemas and tables that you want Datastream to pull.
For each schema that you select, there's a Future tables checkbox.
If this checkbox is selected, then any tables for the schema that you add to the source after the stream is created will be transferred into the destination automatically.
If this checkbox isn't selected, then after the stream is created, Datastream won't transfer any new tables for the schema from the source into the destination.
By default, the Future tables checkbox is selected for each schema.
For each schema table that you select, there's a SELECT COLUMNS button. Click this button to filter any columns of the table that you want to exclude from being streamed from the source into the destination. Any columns that you clear are excluded from the stream.
By default, the checkboxes for all columns of the table are selected.
If you want to provide a textual definition of the tables and schemas that you want Datastream to transfer, select Custom , and then, in the Object matching criteria field, enter the schemas and tables that you want Datastream to pull.
If your database has large numbers of tables and schemas, we recommend using the Custom option because some tables and schemas might not be included in the list of objects to pull.
Enter schemas and tables as a comma-separated list, using the [schema].[table] format, where both the schema and the table can be a wildcard (asterisk). You can't use partial wildcards.
In the Change stream name field, enter the name of the Spanner change stream that you created. Datastream reads this change stream to replicate changes from your source database.
Optionally, in the Objects to exclude field, enter the tables and schemas in the source database that you want to restrict Datastream from pulling. The Objects to exclude list takes precedence over the Objects to include list. If an object meets the criteria in both the include and exclude lists, the object is excluded from the stream.
You define these schemas and tables with the same comma-separated logic that you use if you're specifying schemas and tables that you want Datastream to pull.
In the Choose backfill mode for historical data section, select the backfill mode:
Select the Automatic option to stream all existing data, in addition to changes to the data, from the source into the destination. In the Objects excluded from automatic backfill field, enter the tables and schemas in the source database that you want to restrict Datastream from backfilling into the destination.
Select the Manual option to stream only changes to the data into the destination.
Optionally, specify the maximum number of concurrent CDC and backfill tasks in the respective fields.
Setting the maximum number of concurrent reads for change stream queries (the CDC concurrency limit) might increase streaming latency. This is because change streams are divided into partitions, and limiting concurrency prevents Datastream from reading multiple partitions simultaneously. We recommend setting this value only if you've observed significant CPU usage.
From the RPC priority drop-down, select the remote procedure call priority for your Spanner requests:
Low
Medium
High
In the FGAC role field, specify the fine-grained access control role for your Spanner requests.
Select the Backfill Data Boost enabled checkbox if you want to use Data Boost for backfill jobs. To use this option, Data Boost must be enabled for your database. For more information, see Data Boost overview .
Click CONTINUE . The Define connection profile panel of the Create stream page appears for your destination type.
Select a destination connection profile
If you have created a destination connection profile , then select it from the list of connection profiles.
If you haven't created a destination connection profile, then create one by clicking CREATE CONNECTION PROFILE at the bottom of the drop-down list, and then perform the same steps as in Create connection profiles .
Note: For BigLake Iceberg tables destination, use or create a BigQuery connection profile.
Click CONTINUE . The Configure stream destination panel of the Create stream page appears.
Configure information about the destination for the stream
This section describes what information you need to provide to configure your
BigQuery or Cloud Storage destination.
BigQuery destination
In the Specify how Datastream should stream into a BigQuery dataset section, select one of the following options from the Schema grouping drop-down:
Dataset for each schema : Datastream creates a BigQuery dataset for each source schema, based on the schema name.
If you select this option, then for every schema in the source database, Datastream creates a dataset in the project that contains the stream.
In addition, if you select the Dataset for each schema option, you need to provide the following:
In the Location type section, specify where you want to store your data in BigQuery. Select Region to specify a single geographical location, or Multi-region to specify a larger area that contains two or more regions. If your priority is to optimize costs and performance, select Region , and keep your datasets alongside other Google Cloud resources that you manage. If you want to achieve higher quota limits, select Multi-region to let BigQuery use multiple regions within a group.
When you select Region , the field defaults to the region that you selected for the stream.
(Optional) In the Dataset prefix field, define a prefix for the dataset created by the stream. The string that you specify is added to the source schema name. For example, if the schema is called <mySchema> , and you define the dataset prefix as <myPrefix> , Datastream creates a dataset called <myPrefix><mySchema> .
Expand the Show advanced encryption options section.
Specify how you want your data to be encrypted in BigQuery by selecting a Google-managed or customer-managed encryption key.
Note: The Dataset for each schema option isn't supported for Salesforce sources.
Single dataset for all schemas : Datastream creates all the tables inside the existing BigQuery dataset that you specify.
Each table that Datastream creates is named using a combination of the source schema name and table name, separated by an underscore (for example, <mySchemaName>_<myTableName> ). The datasets available are grouped by region. You can also create a new dataset.
Specify the Stream write mode . Select your write mode to define how data is written and processed in BigQuery:
Merge : select this option if you want your data to be synchronised with the source.
Append-only : select this option if you want to keep all historical data for your change events.
Specify the limit of data staleness . Only available when Merge mode is selected in the preceding step. Select a limit to balance BigQuery query performance and cost versus data freshness. BigQuery applies the changes in the background on an ongoing basis, or at query run time, according to the staleness limit. Lower staleness (fresher data) may increase BigQuery processing costs.
If you select 0 minutes , BigQuery always returns the query results based on the freshest data. This results in the highest cost of the query.
Click CONTINUE . The Review stream details and create panel of the Create stream page appears.
BigLake Iceberg tables destination
In the Specify how Datastream should stream into a BigQuery dataset section, select how you want Datastream to create new schemas and tables from the Schema grouping drop-down:
Dataset for each schema : Datastream creates a BigQuery dataset for each source schema, based on the schema name.
If you select this option, then for every schema in the source database, Datastream creates a dataset in the project that contains the stream.
In addition, if you select the Dataset for each schema option, you need to provide the following:
In the Location type section, specify where you want to store your data in BigQuery. Select Region to specify a single geographical location, or Multi-region to specify a larger area that contains two or more regions. If your priority is to optimize costs and performance, select Region , and keep your datasets alongside other Google Cloud resources that you manage. If you want to achieve higher quota limits, select Multi-region to let BigQuery use multiple regions within a group.
When you select Region , the field defaults to the region that you selected for the stream.
(Optional) In the Dataset prefix field, define a prefix for the dataset created by the stream. The string that you specify is added to the source schema name. For example, if the schema is called <mySchema> , and you define the dataset prefix as <myPrefix> , Datastream creates a dataset called <myPrefix><mySchema> .
Expand the Show advanced encryption options section.
Specify how you want your data to be encrypted in BigQuery by selecting a Google-managed or customer-managed encryption key.
Note: The Dataset for each schema option isn't supported for Salesforce sources.
Single dataset for all schemas : Datastream creates all the tables inside the existing BigQuery dataset that you specify.
Each table that Datastream creates is named using a combination of the source schema name and table name, separated by an underscore (for example, <mySchemaName>_<myTableName> ). The datasets available are grouped by region. You can also create a new dataset.
In the Define Datastream connection to BigLake Iceberg tables section, provide the following information:
From the Connection ID drop-down, select the identifier of the BigQuery connection that you created and that you want to use for your stream. For information about creating a Cloud resource connection in BigQuery, see Configure BigLake Iceberg tables in BigQuery .
Note: To prevent your stream from failing, make sure that the connection ID has write permissions to the underlying Cloud Storage bucket.
Enter or select the URI address of the bucket that you created in Cloud Storage. For information about creating a Cloud Storage bucket, see Create a bucket .
Review the File format and Table format . Datastream supports the Parquet file format and the Iceberg table format.
Review the Stream write mode . Datastream only supports the Append-only write mode when streaming to BigLake Iceberg tables.
Click CONTINUE . The Review stream details and create panel of the Create stream page appears.
Cloud Storage destination
Optionally, in the Stream path prefix field, enter the folder of the destination bucket into which Datastream will transfer schemas, tables, and data from a source database.
For example, if you want Datastream to transfer data from the source database into the /root/example folder in the destination bucket, then enter /root/example in the Stream path prefix field.
In the Output format field, choose the format of files written to Cloud Storage.
Datastream supports two output formats: Avro and JSON.
Optional. If you select the JSON format, then two checkboxes appear:
Include a Unified Types schema file in the file path : If you select this checkbox, then Datastream writes two files to Cloud Storage: a JSON data file and an Avro schema file . The schema file has the same name as the data file, with a .schema extension. If you don't select this checkbox, then Datastream writes only the JSON data file to Cloud Storage. By default, this checkbox isn't selected.
Enable gzip compression : If you select this checkbox, then Datastream uses the gzip utility to compress the files that Datastream writes to Cloud Storage. If you don't select this checkbox, then Datastream writes the files to Cloud Storage without compressing them. By default, this checkbox is selected.
Click CONTINUE . The Review stream details and create panel of the Create stream page appears.
