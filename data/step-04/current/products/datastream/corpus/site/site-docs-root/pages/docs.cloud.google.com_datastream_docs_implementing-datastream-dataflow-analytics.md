Datastream
Datastream supports streaming data from Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases directly into BigQuery datasets. However, if you need more control over the stream processing logic, such as data transformation or manual setting of logical primary keys, you can integrate Datastream with Dataflow job templates.
This tutorial shows you how Datastream integrates with Dataflow
by using Dataflow job templates to stream up-to-date materialized views in BigQuery for analytics.
For organizations with many isolated data sources, access to enterprise data across the organization, especially in a real-time manner, can be limited and slow. This restricts the organization's ability to introspect.
Datastream provides near real-time access to change data from various on-premises and cloud-based data sources. Datastream provides a setup experience where you don't have to do much configuration for streaming data; Datastream does this for you. Datastream also has a unified consumption API which democratizes your organization's access to the freshest available enterprise data to build integrated scenarios.
One such scenario is transferring data from a source database into a cloud-based storage service or messaging queue. After Datastream streams the data, the data is transformed into a form that other applications and services can read. In this tutorial, Dataflow is the web service that communicates with the storage service or messaging queue to capture and process data on Google Cloud.
You learn how to use Datastream to stream changes (data that's inserted, updated, or deleted) from a source MySQL database into a folder in a Cloud Storage bucket. Then, you configure the Cloud Storage bucket to send notifications that Dataflow uses to learn about any new files containing the data changes that Datastream streams from the source database. A Dataflow job then processes the files and transfer the changes into BigQuery.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you:
Create a bucket in Cloud Storage. This is the destination bucket into which Datastream streams schemas, tables, and data from a source MySQL database.
Enable Pub/Sub notifications for the Cloud Storage bucket. By doing this, you're configuring the bucket to send notifications that Dataflow uses to learn about any new files that are ready for processing. These files contain changes to data that Datastream streams from the source database into the bucket.
Create datasets in BigQuery. BigQuery uses datasets to contain the data that it receives from Dataflow. This data represents the changes in the source database that Datastream streams into the Cloud Storage bucket.
Create and manage connection profiles for a source database and a destination bucket in Cloud Storage. A stream in Datastream uses the information in the connection profiles to transfer data from the source database into the bucket.
Create and start a stream. This stream transfers data, schemas, and tables from the source database into the bucket.
Verify that Datastream transfers the data and tables associated with a schema of the source database into the bucket.
Create a job in Dataflow. After Datastream streams data changes from the source database into the Cloud Storage bucket, notifications are sent to Dataflow about new files containing the changes. The Dataflow job processes the files and transfers the changes into BigQuery.
Verify that Dataflow processes the files containing changes associated with this data, and transfers the changes into BigQuery. As a result, you have an end-to-end integration between Datastream and BigQuery.
Clean up the resources that you created on Datastream, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and BigQuery so they don't take up quota and you aren't billed for them in the future.

Make sure that you have the Datastream Admin role granted to your user account.
Go to the IAM page
Make sure that you have a source MySQL database that Datastream can access. Also, verify that you have data, tables, and schemas in the database.
Configure your MySQL database to allow incoming connections from Datastream public IP addresses. For a list of all Datastream regions and their associated public IP addresses, see IP allowlists and regions .
Set up change data capture (CDC) for the source database. For more information, see Configure a source MySQL database .
Make sure that you meet all prerequisites to enable Pub/Sub notifications for Cloud Storage.
In this tutorial, you create a destination bucket in Cloud Storage and enable Pub/Sub notifications for the bucket. By doing this, Dataflow can receive notifications about new files that Datastream writes to the bucket. These files contain changes to data that Datastream streams from the source database into the bucket.
Requirements
Datastream offers a variety of source options , destination options , and networking connectivity methods .
For this tutorial, we assume that you're using a standalone MySQL database and a destination Cloud Storage service. For the source database, you should be able to configure your network to add an inbound firewall rule. The source database can be on-premises or in a cloud provider. For the Cloud Storage destination, no connectivity configuration is required.
Because we can't know the specifics of your environment, we can't provide detailed steps when it comes to your networking configuration.
For this tutorial, you select IP allowlisting as the network connectivity method. IP allowlisting is a security feature often used for limiting and controlling access to the data in your source database to trusted users. You can use IP allowlists to create lists of trusted IP addresses or IP ranges from which your users and other Google Cloud services such as Datastream can access this data. To use IP allowlists, you must open the source database or firewall to incoming connections from Datastream.
Create a bucket in Cloud Storage
Create a destination bucket in Cloud Storage into which Datastream streams schemas, tables, and data from a source MySQL database.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Browser page for Cloud Storage.
Go to the Browser page
Click Create bucket . The Create a bucket page appears.
In the text field of the Name your bucket region, enter a unique name for
your bucket, and then click Continue .
Accept the default settings for each remaining region of the page. At the end
each region, click Continue .
Click Create .
Enable Pub/Sub notifications for the Cloud Storage bucket
In this section, you enable Pub/Sub notifications for the Cloud Storage bucket that you created. By doing this, you're configuring the bucket to notify Dataflow of any new files that Datastream writes to the bucket. These files contain changes to data that Datastream streams from a source MySQL database into the bucket.
Before enabling notifications for your bucket, make sure that you meet all prerequisites .
Access the Cloud Storage bucket that you created. The Bucket details page appears.
Click terminal Activate Cloud Shell .
At the prompt, enter the following command:
gcloud storage buckets notifications create gs:// bucket-name --topic=my_integration_notifs --payload-format=json --object-prefix=integration/tutorial/
bucket-name is a placeholder for the name of your Cloud Storage bucket.
By entering this command, you're creating the my_integration_notifs topic in Pub/Sub. You're also configuring the Pub/Sub notifications to only listen to the Datastream output path which you define in the Create a destination connection profile for Cloud Storage step.
Later in this procedure, you configure this topic in Pub/Sub to have notifications sent to Dataflow about changes to data that Datastream streams into your Cloud Storage bucket.
The Pub/Sub topic captures any changes to this data. Any subscribers to this topic (such as Dataflow) receive this information.
Optional: If an Authorize Cloud Shell window appears, then click Authorize .
Verify that you see the following lines of code:
Created Cloud Pub/Sub topic projects/ project-name /topics/my_integration_notifs
Created notification config projects/_/buckets/ bucket-name /notificationConfigs/1
project-name is a placeholder for the name of your Google Cloud project.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Topics page for Pub/Sub.
Go to the Topics page
Click the my_integration_notifs topic that you created.
On the my_integration_notifs page, go to the bottom of the page. Verify that the Subscriptions tab is active and a No subscriptions to display message appears.
You're going to create a subscription for the my_integration_notifs topic. Apps that subscribe to this subscription, such as Dataflow, can obtain the information in the topic. This information is associated with changes to data in the source database that Datastream streams into your Cloud Storage bucket.
Click Create subscription .
In the menu that appears, select Create subscription .
In the Add subscription to topic page:
In the Subscription ID field, enter my_integration_notifs_sub .
Set the Acknowledgement deadline value to 120 seconds. This allows Dataflow sufficient time to acknowledge the files it has processed, and helps improve the overall performance of the Dataflow job. For more information about Pub/Sub subscription properties, see Subscription properties .
Leave all other default values on the page.
Click Create .
Later in this tutorial, you create a Dataflow job . As part of creating this job, you assign Dataflow to be a subscriber to the my_integration_notifs_sub subscription. By doing this, Dataflow can receive notifications about new files that Datastream writes to Cloud Storage, process the files, and transfer the data changes into BigQuery.
Create datasets in BigQuery
In this section, you create datasets in BigQuery. BigQuery uses datasets to contain the data that it receives from Dataflow. This data represents the changes in the source MySQL database that Datastream streams into your Cloud Storage bucket.
Go to the SQL workspace page for BigQuery in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the SQL workspace page
In the Explorer pane, next to your Google Cloud project name, click
more_vert View actions .
In the menu that appears, select Create dataset .
In the Create dataset window:
In the Dataset ID field, enter an ID for the dataset. For this tutorial, enter My_integration_dataset_log in the field.
Leave all other default values in the window.
Click Create dataset .
Dataflow uses the My_integration_dataset_log dataset to stage the data changes that it receives from Datastream.
In the Explorer pane, next to your Google Cloud project name, click
arrow_right
Expand node , and then verify that you see the dataset that you created.
Use the steps in this procedure to create a second dataset: My_integration_dataset_final .
The changes that are staged in the My_integration_dataset_log dataset are merged into the My_integration_dataset_final dataset to create a one-to-one replica of the tables in the source database.
Next to each dataset, expand
arrow_right
Expand node .
Verify that each dataset is empty.
After Datastream streams data changes from the source database into your Cloud Storage bucket, a Dataflow job processes the files containing the changes and transfers the changes into the BigQuery datasets.
Create connection profiles in Datastream
In this section, you create connection profiles in Datastream for a source database and a destination. As part of creating the connection profiles, you select MySQL as the profile type for your source connection profile and Cloud Storage as the profile type for your destination connection profile.
Datastream uses the information defined in the connection profiles to connect to both the source and the destination so that it can stream data from the source database into your destination bucket in Cloud Storage.
Create a source connection profile for your MySQL database
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Connection profiles page for Datastream.
Go to the Connection profiles page
Click Create profile .
To create a source connection profile for your MySQL database, in the Create a connection profile page, click the MySQL profile type.
In the Define connection settings section of the Create MySQL profile page, supply the following information:
In the Connection profile name field, enter My Source Connection Profile .
Keep the autogenerated Connection profile ID .
Select the Region where you want to store the connection profile.
Connection profiles, like all resources, are saved in a region, and a stream can only use connection profiles that are stored in the same region as the stream. Region selection doesn't impact whether Datastream can connect to the source or the destination, but can impact availability if the region experiences downtime.
Enter Connection details :
In the Hostname or IP field, enter a hostname or public IP address that Datastream can use to connect to the source database. You're providing a public IP address because you use IP allowlisting as the network connectivity method for this tutorial.
In the Port field, enter the port number that's reserved for the source database. For a MySQL database, the default port is typically 3306 .
Enter a Username and Password to authenticate to your source database.
In the Define connection settings section, click Continue . The Secure your connection to your source section of the Create MySQL profile page is active.
From the Encryption type menu, select None . For more information about this menu, see Create a connection profile for MySQL database .
In the Secure your connection to your source section, click Continue . The Define connectivity method section of the Create MySQL profile page is active.
In the Connectivity method drop-down, choose the networking method that you'd like to use to establish connectivity between Datastream and the source database. For this tutorial, select IP allowlisting as the connectivity method.
Configure your source database to allow incoming connections from the Datastream public IP addresses that appear.
In the Define connectivity method section, click Continue . The Test connection profile section of the Create MySQL profile page is active.
Click Run test to verify that the source database and Datastream can communicate with each other.
Verify that you see the Test passed status.
If the test fails, you can address the problem in the appropriate part of the flow, and then return to re-test. Refer to the Diagnose issues page for troubleshooting steps.
Click Create .
Create a destination connection profile for Cloud Storage
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Connection profiles page for Datastream.
Go to the Connection profiles page
Click Create profile .
To create a destination connection profile for Cloud Storage, in the Create a connection profile page, click the Cloud Storage profile type.
In the Create Cloud Storage profile page, supply the following information:
In the Connection profile name field, enter My Destination Connection Profile .
Keep the autogenerated Connection profile ID .
Select the Region where you want to store the connection profile.
In the Connection details pane, click Browse to select the Cloud Storage bucket that you created earlier in this tutorial . This is the bucket into which Datastream transfers data from the source database. After making your selection, click Select .
Your bucket appears in the Bucket name field of the Connection details pane.
In the Connection profile path prefix field, provide a prefix for the path that you want to append to the bucket name when Datastream streams data to the destination. Make sure that Datastream writes data to a path inside the bucket, not to the bucket root folder. For this tutorial, use the path that you defined when you configured your Pub/Sub notification. Enter /integration/tutorial in the field.
Click Create .
After creating a source connection profile for your MySQL database and a destination connection profile for Cloud Storage, you can use them to create a stream.
Create a stream in Datastream
In this section, you create a stream. This stream uses the information in the connection profiles to transfer data from a source MySQL database into a destination bucket in Cloud Storage.
Datastream comes equipped with a setup assistant to help you create a stream. This assistant consists of six panels: Get started, Define & test source, Configure source, Define destination, Configure destination, and Review & create. To populate each panel, complete the instructions in the following sections.
Define settings for the stream
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Streams page for Datastream.
Go to the Streams page
Click Create stream .
Supply the following information in the Define stream details panel of the Create stream page:
In the Stream name field, enter My Stream .
Keep the autogenerated Stream ID .
From the Region menu, select the region where you created your source and destination connection profiles.
From the Source type menu, select the MySQL profile type.
From the Destination type menu, select the Cloud Storage profile type.
Review the required prerequisites that are generated automatically to reflect how your environment must be prepared for a stream. These prerequisites can include how to configure the source database and how to connect Datastream to the destination bucket in Cloud Storage.
For more information about these prerequisites, see Configure a source MySQL database .
Click Continue . The Define MySQL connection profile panel of the Create stream page appears.
Specify information about the source connection profile
In this section, you select the connection profile that you created for your source database (the source connection profile). For this tutorial, this is My Source Connection Profile .
From the Source connection profile menu, select your source connection profile for MySQL database .
Click Run test to verify that the source database and Datastream can communicate with each other.
If the test fails, then the issue associated with the connection profile appears. Refer to the Diagnose issues page for troubleshooting steps. Make the necessary changes to correct the issue, and then retest.
Click Continue . The Configure stream source panel of the Create stream page appears.
Configure information about the source database for the stream
In this section, you configure information about the source database for the stream by specifying the tables and schemas in the source database that Datastream:
Can transfer into the destination.
Is restricted from transferring into the destination.
You also determine whether Datastream backfills historical data, as well as stream ongoing changes into the destination, or stream only changes to the data.
Use the Objects to include menu to specify the tables and schemas in your source database that Datastream can transfer into a folder in the destination bucket in Cloud Storage. The menu only loads if your database has up to 5,000 objects.
For this tutorial, you want Datastream to transfer all tables and schemas. Therefore, select All tables from all schemas from the menu.
Verify that the Select objects to exclude panel is set to None . You don't want to restrict Datastream from transferring any tables and schemas in your source database into Cloud Storage.
Verify that the Choose backfill mode for historical data panel is set to Automatic. Datastream streams all existing data, in addition to changes to the data, from the source into the destination.
Click Continue . The Define Cloud Storage connection profile panel of the Create stream page appears.
Select a destination connection profile
In this section, you select the connection profile that you created for Cloud Storage (the destination connection profile). For this tutorial, this is My Destination Connection Profile .
From the Destination connection profile menu, select your destination connection profile for Cloud Storage .
Click Continue . The Configure stream destination panel of the Create stream page appears.
Configure information about the destination for the stream
In this section you configure information about the destination bucket for the stream. This information includes:
The output format of files written to Cloud Storage.
The folder of the destination bucket into which Datastream transfers schemas, tables, and data from the source database.
In the Output format field, select the format of files written to Cloud Storage. Datastream supports two output formats: Avro and JSON. For this tutorial, Avro is the file format.
You don't have to populate the Stream path prefix field. In this field, you can provide a prefix for the path that's appended to your bucket name when Datastream transfers data to the destination. This is the path of your Cloud Storage bucket into which Datastream transfers schemas, tables, and data from a source MySQL database.
You already provided the path of /integration/tutorial when you created the destination connection profile for Cloud Storage .
Click Continue . The Review stream details and create panel of the Create stream page appears.
Create the stream
Verify details about the stream as well as the source and destination connection profiles that the stream uses to transfer data from a source MySQL database to a destination bucket in Cloud Storage.
To validate the stream, click Run validation . By validating a stream, Datastream checks that the source is configured properly, validates that the stream can connect to both the source and the destination, and verifies the end-to-end configuration of the stream.
If a validation check passes, then a check mark icon appears.
If a validation check doesn't pass, then an exclamation point icon and a See error details button appear. Click the button, and a dialog appears, explaining why the check didn't pass and information about what to do to rectify the problem. After making the appropriate corrections, click Revalidate .
For more information about troubleshooting validation checks that don't pass, see Diagnose issues .
After all validation checks pass, click Create .
In the Create stream? dialog, click Create .
Start the stream
For this tutorial, you create and start a stream separately in case the stream creation process incurs an increased load on your source database. To put off that load, you create the stream without starting it, and then start the stream when your database can handle the load.
By starting the stream, Datastream can transfer data, schemas, and tables from the source database to the destination.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Streams page for Datastream.
Go to the Streams page
Select the checkbox next to the stream that you want to start. For this tutorial, this is My Stream .
Click Start .
In the dialog, click Start . The status of the stream changes from Not started to Starting to Running .
It takes about 30 seconds for the stream to start running. Background resources need to start so that the stream can start.
After starting a stream, you can verify that Datastream transferred data from the source database to the destination.
Verify the stream
In this section, you confirm that Datastream transfers the data from all tables of a source MySQL database into the /integration/tutorial folder of your Cloud Storage destination bucket.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Streams page for Datastream.
Go to the Streams page
Click the stream that you created. For this tutorial, this is My Stream .
In the Stream details page, click the bucket-name /integration/tutorial link, where bucket-name is the name that you gave your Cloud Storage bucket. This link appears after the Destination write path field. The Bucket details page of Cloud Storage opens in a separate tab.
The link is comprised of the name of your bucket and the folder of your bucket into which Datastream transfers schemas, tables, and data from the source database. You specified this folder to be /integration/tutorial when you created the destination connection profile for Cloud Storage .
Verify that you see folders that represent tables of the source database.
Click one of the table folders and then click each subfolder until you see data that's associated with the table.
The first folder is [schema]_[table] , followed by folders that represent the year, month, day, hour, and minute that Datastream transferred data from the source database into a destination bucket in Cloud Storage.
A folder is created every minute (when there's new data to write).
A new file is created when the file size reaches 250 MB, or whenever a schema changes. If tables are partitioned, then files are created for each partition.
Create a Dataflow job
In this section, you create a job in Dataflow. After Datastream streams data changes from a source MySQL database into your Cloud Storage bucket, Pub/Sub sends notifications to Dataflow about new files containing the changes. The Dataflow job processes the files and transfers the changes into BigQuery.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Jobs page for Dataflow.
Go to the Jobs page
Click Create job from template .
In the Job name field of the Create job from template page, enter a name for the Dataflow job that you're creating. For this tutorial, enter my-dataflow-integration-job in the field.
From the Regional endpoint menu, select the region where you want to store the job. This is the same region that you selected for the source connection profile , destination connection profile , and stream that you created.
From the Dataflow template menu, select the template that you're using to create the job. For this tutorial, select Datastream to BigQuery .
After making this selection, additional fields related to this template appear.
The Datastream to BigQuery template is a streaming pipeline that reads Datastream data and replicates it into BigQuery. The template reads data from Cloud Storage using Pub/Sub notifications and replicates it into a time-partitioned BigQuery staging table. Following replication, the template executes a Merge in BigQuery to upsert all change data capture (CDC) changes into a replica of the source table.
To minimize the cost associated with frequent Merge operations, we suggest starting with an initial frequency of once every 6-12 hours. After all backfills have completed and data is replicating smoothly, reduce this value to your selected frequency.
For more information about the Datastream to BigQuery template, see Datastream to BigQuery (Stream) .
In the File location for Datastream file output in Cloud Storage. field, enter the name of your Cloud Storage bucket using the following format: gs:// bucket-name .
In the Pub/Sub subscription being used in a Cloud Storage notification policy. field, enter the path that contains the name of your Pub/Sub subscription. For this tutorial, enter projects/ project-name /subscriptions/my_integration_notifs_sub .
project-name is a placeholder for the name of your Google Cloud project. Also, you created the my_integration_notifs_sub subscription in the Enabling Pub/Sub notifications for the Cloud Storage bucket section of this tutorial.
In the Datastream output file format (avro/json). field, enter avro because, for this tutorial, Avro is the file format of files that Datastream writes to Cloud Storage.
In the Name or template for the dataset to contain staging tables. field, enter My_integration_dataset_log because Dataflow uses this dataset to stage the data changes that it receives from Datastream.
In the Template for the dataset to contain replica tables. field, enter My_integration_dataset_final because this is the dataset where the changes that are staged in the My_integration_dataset_log dataset merge to create a one-to-one replica of the tables in the source database.
You created the My_integration_dataset_log and My_integration_dataset_final datasets in the Create datasets in BigQuery section of this tutorial.
In the Dead letter queue directory. field, enter the path that contains the name of your Cloud Storage bucket and a folder for a dead letter queue. Make sure that you don't use a path in the root folder, and that the path is different than the one to which Datastream writes data. Any data changes that Dataflow fails to transfer into BigQuery are stored in the queue. You can fix the content in the queue so that Dataflow can reprocess it.
For this tutorial, enter gs:// bucket-name /dlq in the Dead letter queue directory. field (where bucket-name is the name of your bucket and dlq is the folder for the dead letter queue).
Click Run job .
It might take several minutes for your Dataflow job to run. Background resources need to run. Also, the job has to process the files containing the data changes that it receives from Cloud Storage before it can transfer these changes into BigQuery.
Verify the integration
In the Verify the stream section of this tutorial, you confirmed that Datastream transferred the data from all tables of a source MySQL database into the /integration/tutorial folder of your Cloud Storage destination bucket.
In this section, you verify that Dataflow processes the files containing changes associated with this data, and transfers the changes into BigQuery. As a result, you have an end-to-end integration between Datastream and BigQuery.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the SQL workspace page for BigQuery.
Go to the SQL workspace page
In the Explorer pane, expand the node next to the name of your Google Cloud project.
Expand the nodes next to the My_integration_dataset_log and My_integration_dataset_final datasets.
Verify that each dataset now contains data. This confirms that Dataflow processed the files containing changes associated with the data that Datastream streamed into Cloud Storage, and transferred these changes into BigQuery.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this tutorial, use the Google Cloud console to do the following:
Delete your project, Datastream stream, and Datastream connection profiles.
Stop the Dataflow job.
Delete the BigQuery datasets, Pub/Sub topic and subscription, and Cloud Storage bucket.
By cleaning up the resources that you created on Datastream, Dataflow, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Storage, you prevent the resources from taking up quota and you aren't billed for them in the future.
Delete your project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you created for this tutorial.
Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for this tutorial, then when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost. When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as the appspot.com URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple tutorials and quickstarts, then reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to the Manage resources page
In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click Delete .
To delete the project, in the dialog, type the project ID, and then click Shut down .
