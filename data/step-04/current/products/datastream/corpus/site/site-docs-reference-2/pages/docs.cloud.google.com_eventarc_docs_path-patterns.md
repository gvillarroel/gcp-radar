Eventarc supports applying a path pattern when filtering. The path
pattern syntax lets you define an expression that matches events. This lets
you control the granularity of the Eventarc trigger you are
creating, and to capture and act on certain events. For example, you can create
a trigger that applies to a single event, such as a change to a specific file,
or you can extend the scope of the pattern and create a trigger that applies
more broadly.
Apply a path pattern
You can apply a path pattern to filter events when you create a trigger
using the Eventarc Google Cloud console page or by running
a gcloud command.
For example, you can apply a path pattern when filtering on resource names or
database instances (a single instance or a path).
Specifying a resource name path pattern applies when creating a trigger
for Cloud Audit Logs events and to resourceName values. A resource
name indicates the resource being audited through an audit log.
Resource names are organized hierarchically using identifiers made up of the
ID of the resource itself and the IDs of any parent resources, all separated by
forward slashes, like this: /projects/project-1/datasets/dataset-id .
The filtering done by Eventarc matches patterns based on the
values of these identifiers. For more information, in this document, see
Resource name format .
Specifying a database instance path pattern applies when creating a
trigger for Firebase Realtime Database events and to instance or ref
values. A database instance indicates a Firebase Realtime Database
instance. You can apply a path pattern to the instance name of the database
instance, or a document path for which you want to receive events when data is
created, updated, or deleted in that path, or any of its children.
Specifying a resource ID path pattern applies when creating a trigger
for Cloud IoT events and to registry and device values.
You can apply a path pattern to filter changes in registries, and devices in a
registry, with wildcard matching.
For details, see the instructions to
create a trigger for a specific provider, event type, and destination .
Identify if you can apply a path pattern
To confirm if you can apply a path pattern to an attribute of an event from a
provider, describe the event provider. For example:
gcloud eventarc providers describe cloudaudit.googleapis.com --location = us-central1
The output is similar to the following and a pathPatternSupported value of
true indicates that you can apply a path pattern:
displayName: Cloud Audit Logs
eventTypes:
- description: An audit log is created that matches the trigger 's filter criteria.
filteringAttributes:
- attribute: methodName
description: The identifier of the service' s operation.
required: true
- attribute: resourceName
description: The complete path to a resource. Used to filter events for a specific
resource.
pathPatternSupported: true
- attribute: serviceName
description: The identifier of the Google Cloud service.
required: true
- attribute: type
required: true
type: google.cloud.audit.log.v1.written
name: projects/project-name/locations/us-central1/providers/cloudaudit.googleapis.com
Or, for example:
gcloud eventarc providers describe firebasedatabase.googleapis.com --location = us-central1
Where the output is similar to the following:
displayName: Firebase Realtime Database
eventTypes:
- description: New data has been created in the database.
filteringAttributes:
- attribute: instance
description: A single database instance.
pathPatternSupported: true
required: true
- attribute: ref
description: Pattern to match for the database instance.
pathPatternSupported: true
required: true
- attribute: type
required: true
type: google.firebase.database.ref.v1.created
[ ... ]

gcloud eventarc providers describe .
Path pattern syntax
The path pattern syntax is defined as follows:
Pattern
/? Segment (/ Segment )*
Segment
CaptureGroup | Expression
CaptureGroup
{ ID (= Expression )? }
Expression
Wildcard | MultiSegmentWildcard | NameSegment
NameSegment
( Character * Wildcard ? Character *)
ID
[a-zA-Z0-9_]+
Wildcard
*
MultiSegmentWildcard
**
Character 1
[\\w\\s\\t~@#$%&.,?:;+='[]()-]
Legend:
?
zero or one
*
zero or more
+
one or more
|
OR
1 Only listed ASCII characters are supported.
Regular expression matching is not supported. Supported metacharacters:
\w refers to a word; also represented as [a-zA-Z0-9_]
\t refers to a tab
\s refers to a whitespace character
Expressions
An expression can be one of the following segment types and cannot be empty:
A single segment Wildcard defined as * matches zero or more characters
in the pattern.
A MultiSegmentWildcard defined as ** matches zero or more segments
in the pattern.
A NameSegment consists of zero or one * and other characters. This
combination lets you filter by prefix, suffix, or file extension; for
example, file-*.txt .
Note that a path can contain many single segment wildcards, but only
one multiple segment wildcard. For example, the following path is invalid:
/projects/**/buckets/** .
Resource regionality
Resource names can contain location identifiers. For example:
/projects/$PROJECT_ID/ locations/$REGION /triggers/my-trigger
However, path pattern matching is constrained by resource regionality. For
example, for Cloud Audit Logs triggers, location wildcards only match
triggers from the Cloud Audit Logs region, or global triggers.
Capture groups
A CaptureGroup lets you capture the content of an expression. You do this
by assigning the value to a variable name in braces; for example,
buckets/{path=**}/files/{filename=file-*.txt} . A single segment wildcard can
omit =* in a capture group; for example,
/projects/_/buckets/{bucket}/objects/file.*
Note: Capture groups have no semantic meaning; only the syntax is supported.
Resource name format
The following table provides examples of full resource names for commonly used
Google Cloud services. It is not a complete list. To learn more about how
full resource names are formatted, see the
Resource names section of the API design guide.

1 For Cloud Firestore, don't specify a leading slash
when creating a trigger
(see examples ).
For more information, see
Cloud Firestore data model .
2 For Cloud Storage, resource names contain an
underscore ( _ ) rather than a project ID. You cannot replace the underscore
with a project ID, project name, or project number.
3 For Cloud Storage, use the entire object name, including
forward slashes. These characters are
part of the object name , not path separators.
Examples
The following examples demonstrate how you can and can't use the syntax.
