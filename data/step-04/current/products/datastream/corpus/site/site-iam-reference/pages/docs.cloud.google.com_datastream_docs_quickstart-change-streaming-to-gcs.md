Requirements
Datastream offers a variety of source options, destination options, and
networking connectivity methods.
In this quickstart, we assume that you're using a standalone Oracle database and
a destination Cloud Storage service. For the source database, you should be
able to configure your network to add an inbound firewall rule. The source
database can be on-premises or in a cloud provider. Because the destination is
Cloud Storage, it should be in Google's cloud provider.
Because we can't know the specifics of your environment, we can't provide
detailed steps when it comes to your networking configuration.
For this quickstart, you'll select IP allowlisting as the connectivity
method. IP allowlisting is a security feature often used for limiting and
controlling access to the data in your source database to trusted users. You can
use IP allowlists to create lists of trusted IP addresses or IP ranges from
which your users and other Cloud services such as Datastream can access
this data. To use IP allowlists, you must open the source database or firewall
to incoming connections from Datastream.
Create connection profiles
By creating connection profiles for a source database and a destination, you're
creating records that contain information about the source and the destination.
In this quickstart, you'll select Oracle as the profile type for your source
connection profile, and Cloud Storage as the profile type for your
destination connection profile. Datastream uses the information in the
connection profiles to migrate data from the source Oracle database into a
destination bucket in Cloud Storage.
Create a source connection profile for Oracle database
Go to the Connection profiles page for Datastream in the
Google Cloud Console.
Go to the Connection profiles page
Click CREATE PROFILE .
In the Create a connection profile page, click the Oracle profile
type (because you want to create a source connection profile for Oracle
database).
Supply the following information in the Define connection settings
section of the Create Oracle profile page:
Enter My Source Connection Profile as the Connection
profile name for your source database.
Keep the auto-generated Connection profile ID .
Select the Region where the connection profile will be stored.
Connection profiles, like all resources, are saved in a region, and a stream can only use connection profiles that are stored in the same region as the stream. Region selection doesn't impact whether Datastream can connect to the source or the destination, but can impact availability if the region experiences downtime.
Enter Connection details :
In the Hostname or IP field, enter a hostname or public IP address
that Datastream can use to connect to the source Oracle
database. You're providing a public IP address because IP allowlist
will be used as the network connectivity method for this quickstart.
In the Port field, enter the port number that's reserved for the
source database. For an Oracle database, the default port is typically
1521 .
Enter a Username and Password to authenticate to your source
database.
In the System identifier (SID) field, enter the SID or service name
that identifies the database instance. For Oracle databases, this is
typically ORCL .
In the Define connection settings section, click CONTINUE . The
Define connectivity method section of the Create Oracle profile page
is active.
Choose the networking method that you'd like to use to establish
connectivity between Datastream and the source database. For this
quickstart, use the Connectivity method drop-down menu to select IP
allowlisting as the networking method.
Configure your source database to allow incoming connections from the
Datastream public IP addresses that appear.
In the Define connectivity method section, click CONTINUE . The
Test connection profile section of the Create Oracle profile page is
active.
Datastream comes equipped with a wizard to help you create a stream. This wizard consists of six panels: Get started, Define & test source, Configure source, Define destination, Configure destination, and Review & create. Information on how to populate each panel is provided in the various sections of this page.
Define settings for the stream
Go to the Streams page for Datastream in the Google Cloud
Console.
Go to the Streams page
Click CREATE STREAM .
Supply the following information in the Define stream details panel of
the Create stream page:
Enter My Stream as the Stream name .
Keep the auto-generated Stream ID .
From the Region menu, select the region where you created your
source connection profile.
From the Source type menu, select the Oracle profile type.
From the Destination type menu, select the Cloud Storage
profile type.
Review the required prerequisites that are generated automatically to
reflect how your environment must be prepared for a stream. These
prerequisites can include how to configure the source database and how to
connect Datastream to the destination bucket in Cloud Storage.
For more information about these prerequisites, see Configure a source Oracle database .
Click CONTINUE . The Define Oracle connection profile panel of the
Create stream page appears.
Specify information about the source connection profile
From the Source connection profile menu, select your source connection profile for Oracle
database .
Click RUN TEST to verify that the source database and
Datastream can communicate with each other.
If the test fails, then the issue associated with the connection profile
appears. Refer to the Diagnose issues
page for troubleshooting steps. Make the necessary changes to correct the
issue, and then retest.
Click CONTINUE . The Configure stream source panel of the Create
stream page appears.
Configure information about the source database for the stream
Use the Objects to include menu to specify the tables and schemas in
your source database that Datastream can transfer into a folder in
the destination bucket in Cloud Storage. The menu only loads if your
database has up to 5,000 objects.
For this quickstart, you want Datastream to transfer all tables and
schemas. Therefore, select All tables from all schemas from the menu.
For this quickstart, make sure that the Select objects to exclude panel is set to "None." You don't want to restrict Datastream from transferring any tables and schemas in your source database into Cloud Storage.
Also, make sure that the Choose backfill mode for historical data panel is set to "Automatic." Datastream will stream all existing data, in addition to changes to the data, from the source into the destination.
Specify the CDC method. For this tutorial, select Logminer .
Click CONTINUE . The Define Cloud Storage connection profile panel
of the Create stream page appears.
Select a destination connection profile
From the destination connection profile menu, select your destination connection profile for
Cloud Storage .
Click CONTINUE . The Configure stream destination panel of the
Create stream page appears.
Configure information about the destination for the stream
In the Stream path prefix field, enter the folder of the destination
bucket into which Datastream will transfer schemas, tables, and
data from a source Oracle database.
For this quickstart, you want Datastream to transfer data from the
source database into the /root/tutorial folder in the
destination bucket of Cloud Storage. Therefore, enter /root/tutorial
in the Stream path prefix field.
In the Output format field, select the format of files written to
Cloud Storage. For this quickstart, Avro is the file format.
Click CONTINUE . The Review stream details and create panel of the
Create stream page appears.
Create the stream
Verify details about the stream as well as the source and destination
connection profiles that the stream will use to transfer data from a source
Oracle database to a destination bucket in Cloud Storage.
Click RUN VALIDATION to validate the stream. By validating a stream,
Datastream checks that the source is configured properly, validates
that the stream can connect to both the source and the destination, and
verifies the end-to-end configuration of the stream.
If a validation check passes, then a check mark icon appears to the left of the validation check.
If a validation check doesn't pass, then an exclamation point icon appears to the left of the check, and a SEE ERROR DETAILS button appears below the check. Click the button, and a message appears, explaining why the check didn't pass and information about what to do to rectify the problem. After making the appropriate corrections, click REVALIDATE .
For more information about troubleshooting validation checks that don't pass, see Diagnose issues .
After all validation checks pass, click CREATE .
In the Create stream? dialog, click CREATE .
After creating a stream, you can start it.
Start the stream
In the previous section of the quickstart, you created a stream, but you didn't
start it. You can do this now.
For this quickstart, you create and start a stream separately in case the stream
creation process incurs an increased load on your source database. To put off
that load, you create the stream without starting it, and then start the stream
when the load can be incurred.
By starting the stream, Datastream can transfer data, schemas, and
tables from the source database to the destination.
Go to the Streams page for Datastream in the Google Cloud
Console.
Go to the Streams page
Select the checkbox to the left of the stream that you want to start. For
this quickstart, this is My Stream .
Click START .
In the dialog, click START . The status of the stream changes from Not started
to Starting to Running .
It takes about 30 seconds for the stream to start running. Background resources need to start so that the stream can start.
After starting a stream, you can verify that Datastream transferred
data from the source database to the destination.
Verify the stream
In this section, you confirm that Datastream transfers the data from
all tables of your source Oracle database into the /root/tutorial
folder of your Cloud Storage destination bucket.
Go to the Streams page for Datastream in the Google Cloud
Console.
Go to the Streams page
Click the stream that you created. For this quickstart, this is My
Stream .
In the Stream details page, click the link that appears below the
Destination write path field. The Bucket details page of
Cloud Storage opens in a separate tab.
Note: The link you click is comprised of the name of your bucket and the
folder of your bucket into which Datastream transferred schemas,
tables, and data from your source Oracle database. You specified this folder
to be /root/tutorial when you configured information about the destination connection profile for your
stream . So, the link should appear as
BUCKET-NAME /root/tutorial**.
Verify that you see folders that represent tables of your source Oracle
database.
Click one of the table folders and drill down until you see data that's
associated with the table.
The first folder is [schema]_[table] , followed by folders that represent the year, month, day, hour, and minute that Datastream transferred data from the source Oracle database into a destination bucket in Cloud Storage.
A folder is created every minute (when there's new data to write).
A new file is created when the file size reaches 250 MB, or whenever a schema changes. If tables are partitioned, then files are created for each partition.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
Use the Google Cloud console to delete your project, Datastream
stream and connection profiles, and Cloud Storage destination bucket.
By cleaning up the resources that you created on Datastream, they won't
take up quota and you won't be billed for them in the future. The following
sections describe how to delete or turn off these resources.
Delete your project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you created
for this quickstart.
Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for this quickstart, then when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost. When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as appspot.com , delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple tutorials and quickstarts, then reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to the Manage resources page
In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then
click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click Shut down to delete
the project.
Delete the stream
Go to the Streams page for Datastream in the Google Cloud
Console.
Go to the Streams page
Click the stream that you want to delete. For this quickstart, this is My
Stream .
Click PAUSE .
In the dialog, click PAUSE .
In the Stream status pane of the Stream details page, verify that
the status of the stream is Paused .
Note: You pause the stream before deleting it to make sure that all "in
flight" data is transferred cleanly from the source database to the
destination.
Click DELETE .
In the dialog, enter Delete in the text field, and then click
DELETE .
Delete the connection profiles
Go to the Connection profiles page for Datastream in the
Google Cloud Console.
Go to the Connection profiles page
Select the checkbox for each connection profile that you want to delete. For
this quickstart, select the check boxes for My Source Connection Profile
and My Destination Connection Profile .
Click DELETE .
In the dialog, click DELETE .
Delete your Cloud Storage destination bucket
Go to the Browser page for Cloud Storage in the Google Cloud
Console.
Go to the Browser page
Select the checkbox to the left of your bucket, and then click
DELETE .
In the dialog, enter DELETE in the text field, and then click
DELETE .
