Configure an Amazon RDS Oracle database for CDC
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to configure change data capture (CDC) to
stream data from an Amazon RDS Oracle database to a supported destination ,
such as BigQuery or Cloud Storage.
You can configure your source Oracle database for use with the following CDC
methods:
Binary log reader ( Preview )
LogMiner API
For more information about the binary log reader and the LogMiner API, see
Work with Oracle database redo log files .
For detailed instructions about how to configure your source Oracle database for
each of these methods, see the sections that follow.
Configure your Amazon RDS Oracle database for binary log reader
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
For Amazon RDS sources, Datastream supports only database directory
objects as the log access method for the binary log reader. You need to create
the database directories that point to the online redo log files and the archived
log files. The names of these directories are static and can't be changed later.
You need to provide these names to Datastream when you create your stream.
Connect to your source Amazon RDS instance.
In the terminal, or using the Amazon RDS dashboard, run the following commands:
BEGIN
rdsadmin . rdsadmin_master_util . create_archivelog_dir ;
END ;
BEGIN
rdsadmin . rdsadmin_master_util . create_onlinelog_dir ;
END ;
COMMIT ;
GRANT READ ON DIRECTORY ONLINELOG_DIR TO USER_NAME ;
GRANT READ ON DIRECTORY ARCHIVELOG_DIR TO USER_NAME ;
Verify that your database is running in ARCHIVELOG mode. To do
so, sign in to your Oracle database and run the following command at the SQL
prompt:
SELECT LOG_MODE FROM V$DATABASE;
If the result is ARCHIVELOG , then move on to step c.
If the result is NOARCHIVELOG , then you'll need to enable ARCHIVELOG mode for your database.
For your database to run in ARCHIVELOG mode, you must enable backups for the database.
Archived log files consume disk space, so you'll want to configure the DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST_SIZE parameter for your database. Use this parameter to specify (in bytes) the hard limit on the total space to be used by target database recovery files. By setting this parameter, you can manage the tradeoff between protecting the database from running out of disk space and the stream failing because of log position loss.
Define a data retention policy for your database by running this command:
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . set_configuration ( 'archivelog retention hours' , 96 );
We recommend that you retain backups and archive logs for a minimum of 4 days, and 7 days is recommended.
Running this command will restart your database instance so that the changes you made to the database can take effect.
Configure the Oracle log file rotation policy. We recommend setting a maximum log file size to a value lower than 1GB.
Enable supplemental log data . To do so, first enable minimal database-level supplemental logging by running the following command:
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . alter_supplemental_logging ( 'ADD' );
Next, choose whether to turn on logging for specific tables or the entire database.
To log changes only for specific tables, run the following command for each table that you want to replicate:
ALTER TABLE SCHEMA . TABLE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA ( ALL ) COLUMNS ;
Replace the following:
SCHEMA : the name of the schema that contains the table.
TABLE : the name of the table for which you want to log changes.
To replicate most or all tables in your database, consider turning logging on
for the entire database. At the SQL prompt, run the following command to enable
supplemental log data for the entire database:
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . alter_supplemental_logging ( 'ADD' , 'ALL' );
The supplemental logging mode must be set to ALL . You can't set this mode to PK_ONLY .
Grant the following privileges to the database user:
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'GV_$LOG' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'GV_$LOGFILE' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'GV_$ARCHIVED_LOG' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'GV_$INSTANCE' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'GV_$STANDBY_LOG' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$INSTANCE' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$PDBS' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$TRANSPORTABLE_PLATFORM' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$DATABASE' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$PARAMETER' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'COL$' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'DBA_OBJECTS' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'DBA_TABLESPACES' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'DBA_ENCRYPTED_COLUMNS' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'DBA_EXTENTS' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
GRANT CONNECT TO USER_NAME ;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO USER_NAME ;
GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO USER_NAME ;
Replace USER_NAME with the name of the user account that you intend to use to
connect to your database.
Configure your Amazon RDS Oracle database for LogMiner
Verify that your database is running in ARCHIVELOG mode. To do so, sign in
to your Oracle database and run the following command at the SQL prompt:
SELECT LOG_MODE FROM V$DATABASE ;
If the result is ARCHIVELOG , then move on to step c.
If the result is NOARCHIVELOG , then you'll need to enable ARCHIVELOG
mode for your database.
Key point: For your database to run in ARCHIVELOG mode, you must enable
backups for the database.
Archived log files consume disk space, so you'll want to configure the
DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST_SIZE
parameter for your database. Use this parameter to specify (in bytes)
the hard limit on the total space to be used by target database recovery
files. By setting this parameter, you can manage the tradeoff between
protecting the database from running out of disk space and the stream
failing because of log position loss.
Define a data retention policy for your database by running this
command:
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . set_configuration ( 'archivelog retention hours' , 96 );
We recommend that you retain backups and archive logs for a minimum of
4 days, and 7 days is recommended.
Note: Running this command will restart your database instance so that the
changes you made to the database can take effect.
5. Configure the Oracle log file rotation policy. We recommend setting a
maximum log file size to a value lower than 1GB.
Enable supplemental log data . To do so, first
enable minimal database-level supplemental logging by running the following
command:
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . alter_supplemental_logging ( 'ADD' );
Next, choose whether to turn on logging for specific tables or the entire
database.
To log changes only for specific tables, run the following command for each
table that you want to replicate:
ALTER TABLE SCHEMA . TABLE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA (ALL) COLUMNS;
Replace the following:
SCHEMA : the name of the schema that contains the table.
TABLE : the name of the table for which you want to log changes.
To replicate most or all tables in your database, consider turning logging on
for the entire database.
At the SQL prompt, run the following command to enable supplemental log data for
the entire database:
exec rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.alter_supplemental_logging('ADD','ALL');
Important: The supplemental logging mode must be set to ALL . You can't set
this mode to PK_ONLY .
Grant the appropriate privileges to the user account that will be used to connect to your database. To do so, run the following commands:
GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO USER_NAME ;
GRANT CONNECT TO USER_NAME ;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO USER_NAME ;
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$DATABASE' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$ARCHIVED_LOG' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$LOG' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' ); -- for primary databases
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$STANDBY_LOG' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' ); -- for standby databases
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$LOGFILE' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$LOGMNR_LOGS' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$LOGMNR_CONTENTS' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'V_$PARAMETER' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'DBMS_LOGMNR' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'EXECUTE' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'DBMS_LOGMNR_D' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'EXECUTE' );
GRANT SELECT ANY TRANSACTION TO USER_NAME ;
GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO USER_NAME ;
If your database uses Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), grant the following permissions:
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'DBA_TABLESPACES' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
exec rdsadmin . rdsadmin_util . grant_sys_object ( 'DBA_ENCRYPTED_COLUMNS' , ' USER_NAME ' , 'SELECT' );
If your organization doesn't permit granting the GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE permission, use the solution described in the Oracle change data capture (CDC) section of the Datastream FAQ page.
If your source database is Oracle 12c or newer, then grant the following additional privilege:
GRANT LOGMINING TO USER_NAME ;
For each command, replace USER_NAME with the name of the user account. Also, running these commands will grant privileges to the user to read from V$DATABASE (which is required for validation), start the log miner, and grant privileges to select from V$LOGMNR_CONTENT .
Grant the user account SELECT access to the DBA_EXTENTS view in your database. This privilege lets you use the ROWID based backfill for your Oracle source:
GRANT SELECT ON DBA_EXTENTS TO USER_NAME ;
