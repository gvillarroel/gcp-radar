Security, privacy, and compliance for Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the controls that support the security of
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise. These controls can
also help you meet the privacy and regulatory requirements that apply to your
business.
The security, privacy, and compliance for Google Cloud services is a
shared responsibility .
For example, Google secures the infrastructure that Google Cloud services
run on, and provides you with tools such as access controls to let you manage
who has access to your services and resources. For more information about how we
secure the infrastructure, see the Google infrastructure security design
overview .
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise architecture
The following diagram shows the components of the
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise architecture.
The components include the following:
In your on-premises environment, your application developers install the
Gemini Code Assist extension for Visual Studio Code or
JetBrains. Developers can use this extension to interact with
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise.
By default, the extension uses an encrypted TLS connection over the
internet to connect from your on-premises environment to
Google Cloud. To create a dedicated secured connection between your
on-premises environment and Google Cloud, you can configure
Cloud VPN
or
Cloud Interconnect .
Within your Google Cloud environment, you can set up a
VPC Service Controls service perimeter .
VPC Service Controls lets you define security policies that prevent access to
Google-managed services outside of a trusted perimeter, block access to
data from untrusted locations, and mitigate data exfiltration risks.
Your Google Cloud project where you enabled the
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise service.
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise use the
Gemini for Google Cloud API
to process conversations. The Gemini for Google Cloud API doesn't have access to
any of the other APIs or resources in your project.
Alternatively, if your organization uses
Cloud Workstations ,
developers can interact with Gemini Code Assist Standard and
Enterprise in their workstations. For more information, see
Code with Gemini Code Assist .
Unlike most Google Cloud APIs, Gemini for Google Cloud API is an API
that's developed for Google-provided clients only. This API enables these
clients to access the stateless LLMs that power
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise. These LLM instances
are shared by all Google customers who enable the Gemini for Google Cloud API
Standard and Enterprise.
Deployment security controls
This section describes some of the security controls for
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise on Google Cloud.
Authentication
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise require that your
application developers authenticate to Google Cloud to verify their
identity and access privileges. You must set up each developer with a
user account that is managed
by Cloud Identity, Google Workspace, or an
identity provider that you've federated
with Cloud Identity or Google Workspace. For more information, see
Overview of identity and access management .
After you create the accounts, consider the following security best
practices:
Enable
single sign-on
when authenticating with external identity providers.
Use
2-step verification
to help protect users from stolen passwords.
Enforce and monitor password requirements .
Access controls
You can use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control
application developer access to Gemini Code Assist Standard or
Enterprise. To manage IAM roles at scale, we recommend that you
create a group
for your application developers and grant the IAM roles or
permissions that are required for Gemini Code Assist Standard and
Enterprise to that group. We don't recommend granting IAM roles
to individual users because individual assignments can increase the complexity
of managing and auditing roles.
When you assign roles to your application developer group, ensure that you
abide by the principle of least privilege and other
IAM security best practices .
Use the processes in your existing identity provider for group creation and
membership. For more information about setting up IAM, see
IAM overview .
For more information about the IAM roles that are required for
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise, see
Set up Gemini Code Assist for a project .
For information about the minimum permissions that your application developers
require, see
Advanced setup tasks .
To audit administrative and access activities, see Gemini for
Google Cloud .
Network security
By default, Google applies protections to data in transit for all
Google Cloud services, including Gemini Code Assist
Standard and Enterprise.
The main connection is the connection between your application developer
workstations and Google Front End (GFE). GFE is our globally distributed system
that routes traffic between the Google network and the outside world.
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise use this connection to
receive and respond to developer prompts. By default, this connection is
protected using TLS. For more information about default network protections, see
Encryption in transit .
If required by your organization, you can configure additional security
controls to further protect traffic on the Google Cloud network and
traffic between the Google Cloud network and your corporate network.
Consider the following:
Use Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect to maximize
security and reliability for the connection between your corporate network
and Google Cloud. For more information, see
Choosing a Network Connectivity product .
Use VPC Service Controls. VPC Service Controls lets you
control the movement of data in Google services and set up context-based
perimeter security. For more information on setting up
VPC Service Controls, see
Configure VPC Service Controls for Gemini .
In Google Cloud, consider
Shared VPC
as your network topology. Shared VPC provides centralized network
configuration management while maintaining separation of environments. For
more information about network topologies, see
Decide the network design for your Google Cloud landing zone .
For more information about network security best practices, see
Secure your network
and
Decide the network design for your Google Cloud landing zone .
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise data protection and privacy
This section describes how Gemini Code Assist Standard and
Enterprise protect your data and privacy.
Customer Data
Customer Data is defined in the
Google Cloud Terms of Service .
For information about how we process and protect Customer Data, see the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum (Customers) .
For example, Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise handle
the following data as Customer Data:
Prompt data, which includes developer queries
Response data from Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise
Additional context, such as the current conversation history, snippets
of files that are open in the IDE, snippets of files that are stored
adjacent to the open file, and cursor location in the current file
Because Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise are stateless
Google Cloud services, they don't store prompts and responses in
Google Cloud. If required, you can set up
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise to store user input
and responses in a Cloud Logging bucket. For more information, see
View Gemini logs . To monitor
Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise usage, see
Monitor Gemini for Google Cloud usage .
