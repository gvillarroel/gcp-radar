Get more relevant suggestions with remote repository context
You can get more contextually aware and relevant code suggestions by directing
Gemini Code Assist to focus on specific remote repositories.
This is useful when your task centers on a specific set of microservices,
libraries, or modules.
Before you begin
Before you use a remote repository as context, you must first
index and configure it for code customization .
Use a remote repository as context
To direct Gemini Code Assist to use one or more repositories
as the primary context for your prompts:
In your IDE's chat, start your prompt with the @ symbol.
A list of your available indexed remote repositories appears.
Select the repository (or repositories) you want to use for context from
the list. You can also start typing the repository name to filter the list.
After selecting the repositories, write the rest of your prompt.
Gemini Code Assist then prioritizes the selected repositories
when generating a response.
Example prompts
This section includes examples of how you can get more relevant suggestions with
remote repository context.
Understand a repository
@REPOSITORY_NAME What is the overall structure of this repository?
@REPOSITORY_NAME I'm a new team member. Can you give me an overview of
this repository's purpose and key modules?
Generate and modify code
@REPOSITORY_NAME Implement an authentication function similar to the one
in this repository.
@REPOSITORY_NAME Refactor the following code to follow the conventions in
the selected repository.
Use the library-x in @REPOSITORY_A_NAME-A and implement the function-x
Test
@UNIT_TEST_FILE_NAME Generate unit tests for module-x based on the examples
in the selected file.
By using remote repositories as a focused source of context, you can get more
accurate and relevant suggestions from Gemini Code Assist, which
can help you code faster and more efficiently.
Use smart actions
To help you be more productive while minimizing context switching,
Gemini Code Assist provides AI-powered smart actions directly in
your code editor. When you select your code in your code editor, you can view
and select from a list of actions relevant to your context.
To use smart actions in your code, follow these steps:
VS Code
In your code file, select a block of code.
Next to the selected code block, click
lightbulb Show Code
Actions .
Select an action such as Generate unit tests .
Gemini Code Assist generates a response that's based on the
action you selected.
IntelliJ
In your code file, select a line or block of code.
Right-click the selected code and select a smart action, like
Generate unit tests .
Selecting the smart action will automatically prompt
Gemini Code Assist to generate a response to the prompt in
the Gemini Code Assist tool window.
Use code transformation quick fix
If there's an error in your code, Gemini Code Assist gives you
the option to apply a quick fix to the error with code transformation.
To apply a quick fix in your code file, follow these steps:
VS Code

Exclude files from local context
If files are specified in a .aiexclude or .gitignore file,
Gemini Code Assist by default excludes them from local use in the
context for code completion, code generation, code transformation, and chat.
To learn how to exclude files from local use, see
Exclude files from Gemini Code Assist use .
Disable code suggestions that match cited sources
Gemini Code Assist provides citation information when it directly
quotes at length from another source, such as existing open source code. For
more information, see
How and when Gemini cites sources .
To prevent code that matches cited sources from being suggested to you, do the
following:
VS Code
