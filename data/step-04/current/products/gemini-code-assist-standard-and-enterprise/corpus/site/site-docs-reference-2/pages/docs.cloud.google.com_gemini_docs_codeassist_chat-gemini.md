Specify files and folders in your workspace context
By default, Gemini Code Assist uses the current open file as
context. You can specify files or folders in your workspace for
Gemini Code Assist to use as additional context. When you specify
a folder, Gemini Code Assist uses the files in the folder as well
as the files in subfolders as context.
Note: When you include a folder, Gemini Code Assist selects up to
the first 100 files it finds within the folder and its subfolders. If you
require codebase awareness beyond this limit, you may want to consider use of
code customization .

Manage files and folders in the Context Drawer
After you specify a file or folder to be used as context for your Gemini Code Assist prompts , these files and folders
are placed in the Context Drawer , where you can view and remove them from the
prompt context.
To manage the files and folders in your Context Drawer, perform the following
tasks:
VS Code
Note: Chats created with Gemini Code Assist for VS Code, prior
to version 2.34.0 , won't retain and display the saved context in the Context
