Page Summary

The Google Maps SDK for iOS provides classes for map display, interaction, and customization within iOS apps.
Core map and navigation classes like GMSMapView , GMSNavigationSession , and GMSNavigator enable displaying maps, managing navigation sessions, and controlling navigation routes.
Map objects and utilities such as GMSMarker , GMSPolygon , and GMSCircle allow developers to add and manipulate various elements on the map.
The SDK offers advanced features like location simulation ( GMSLocationSimulator ), road snapping ( GMSRoadSnappedLocationProvider ), and indoor building display ( GMSIndoorDisplay ).
Developers can customize map appearance with styles ( GMSMapStyle ), camera settings ( GMSCameraPosition ), and UI settings ( GMSUISettings ).

This layer should not be instantiated directly. It provides model access to the camera normally
defined on GMSMapView .
Modifying or animating these properties will typically interrupt any current gesture on
GMSMapView , e.g., a user’s pan or rotation. Similarly, if a user performs an enabled gesture
during an animation, the animation will stop ‘in-place’ (at the current presentation value).
Declaration

GMSMapStyle holds details about a style which can be applied to a map.
With style options you can customize the presentation of the standard Google map styles, changing
the visual display of features like roads, parks, and other points of interest. As well as
changing the style of these features, you can also hide features entirely. This means that you
can emphasize particular components of the map or make the map complement the content of your
app.
For more information see: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/styling
Declaration
Swift
class GMSMapStyle : NSObject
Objective-C
@interface GMSMapStyle : NSObject
GMSMarker

GMSOverlay is an abstract class that represents some overlay that may be attached to a specific
GMSMapView. It may not be instantiated directly; instead, instances of concrete overlay types
should be created directly (such as GMSMarker , GMSPolyline , and GMSPolygon ).
This supports the NSCopying protocol; [overlay_ copy] will return a copy of the overlay type,
but with map set to nil.
Declaration
Swift
class GMSOverlay : NSObject , NSCopying
Objective-C
@interface GMSOverlay : NSObject < NSCopying >
GMSOverlayLayer
GMSOverlayLayer is a custom subclass of CALayer , and an abstract baseclass for GMSOverlay
layers that allow custom animations.
Note that this CALayer or any subclass are never actually rendered directly, as GMSMapView is
provided entirely via an OpenGL layer. As such, adjustments or animations to ‘default’
properties of CALayer will not have any effect.
This is an implementation detail and it should not be instantiated directly.
Declaration
Swift
class GMSOverlayLayer : CALayer
Objective-C
@interface GMSOverlayLayer : CALayer
GMSPanorama

Declaration
Swift
class GMSPanoramaService : NSObject
Objective-C
@interface GMSPanoramaService : NSObject
GMSPanoramaView
A panorama is used to display Street View imagery. It should be constructed via
[[GMSPanoramaView alloc] initWithFrame:] , and configured post-initialization.
All properties and methods should be accessed on the main thread, similar to all UIKit objects.
The GMSPanoramaViewDelegate methods will also be called back only on the main thread.
The backgroundColor of this view is shown while no panorama is visible, such as while it is
loading or if the panorama is later set to nil. The alpha color of backgroundColor is not
supported.

and define a filled region.
Declaration

class GMSPolygon : GMSOverlay
Objective-C
@interface GMSPolygon : GMSOverlay
GMSPolygonLayer
GMSPolygonLayer is a subclass of GMSOverlayLayer , available on a per-polygon basis, that
allows animation of several properties of its associated GMSPolygon .
Note that this CALayer is never actually rendered directly, as GMSMapView is provided
entirely via an OpenGL layer. As such, adjustments or animations to ‘default’ properties of
CALayer will not have any effect.
Declaration
Swift
class GMSPolygonLayer : GMSOverlayLayer
Objective-C
@interface GMSPolygonLayer : GMSOverlayLayer
GMSPolyline
GMSPolyline specifies the available options for a polyline that exists on the Earth’s surface.

view CGPoint . A projection is constant and immutable, in that the mapping it embodies never
changes. The mapping is not necessarily linear.
Passing invalid Earth coordinates (i.e., per CLLocationCoordinate2DIsValid ) to this object may
result in undefined behavior.

Swift
class GMSTextureStyle : GMSStampStyle
Objective-C
@interface GMSTextureStyle : GMSStampStyle
GMSSpriteStyle
Describes the drawing style for a stamp image over a GMSStyleSpan .
Note
Only supports transparent background. If any color is set to the GMSStyleSpan it will
only be treated as a fallback.
Note
Use of GMSSpriteStyle requires Metal rendering framework. See
GMSServices::setMetalRendererEnabled:(BOOL) to learn how to enable Metal. If GMSStyleSpan is
added to a map without Metal being enabled, the stamp will not render and instead the polyline
span will attempt to fallback to any set color. If no color is set, it will fallback to the
default polyline color, [UIColor blueColor].
Note
Use GMSMapView::mapCapabilities property to query if a GMSMapView supports
GMSSpriteStyle .
Declaration
Swift
class GMSSpriteStyle : GMSStampStyle

Objective-C
@interface GMSSyncTileLayer : GMSTileLayer
GMSTileLayer
GMSTileLayer is an abstract class that allows overlaying of custom image tiles on a specified
GMSMapView . It may not be initialized directly, and subclasses must implement the
tileForX:y:zoom: method to return tiles.
At zoom level 0 the whole world is a square covered by a single tile, and the coordinates x and
y are both 0 for that tile. At zoom level 1, the world is covered by 4 tiles with x and y
being 0 or 1, and so on.
Declaration
Swift
class GMSTileLayer : NSObject
Objective-C
@interface GMSTileLayer : NSObject
GMSURLTileLayer
GMSURLTileProvider fetches tiles based on the URLs returned from a GMSTileURLConstructor . For
example:

NSString *URLStr =
[NSString stringWithFormat:@" https://example.com/%d/%d/%d.png ", x, y, zoom];
return [NSURL URLWithString:URLStr];
};
GMSTileLayer *layer =
[GMSURLTileLayer tileLayerWithURLConstructor:constructor];
layer.userAgent = @"SDK user agent";
