To create a serving config, complete the following steps:

On the Create Serving Config page, choose Search as the product the serving configuration
will be used for.
Provide a name for your serving configuration. The name must be
1024 characters or less, and can contain only alphanumeric characters,
underscores, hyphens, and spaces.
Optional: If needed, update the ID. The ID is generated from the
name you provide, and must be unique across your project. It must be 50
characters or less, and cannot contain spaces.
Click Continue .
Choose whether to enable dynamic faceting for this serving configuration.
Choose or create serving controls to optimize your searches with. For more
information on controls, see Creating and managing controls.
Manage resources and monitor activity
When you have completed your initial configuration of your project, the
Google Cloud console dashboard displays the system state of your
Vertex AI Search for commerce project. The console dashboard lets you manage resources and
monitor activity.
Go to the Search for commerce console
Create an API key
An API key is required if you use a JavaScript pixel or a Tag Manager tag
to capture user events from users' browsers. For more information about ways to
capture user events, see Record real-time user events .
To create an API key for calls to the userEvents.Collect
method, complete the following steps:
Go to the
Google Cloud console Credentials
page.
In the project drop-down at the top of the Google Cloud console page, select
your project (the project may already be selected).
Click Create credentials and then select API key .
Do not add any website application restrictions . Some user privacy
settings are known to not pass the referrer URL.
Take note of the generated API key, which you use when calling
user event logging.
For increased security, add an
API restriction
to your API Key to restrict access to the Vertex AI Search for commerce service
at https://retail.googleapis.com/* .
Note: The API key is only for authenticating the userEvents.Collect method.
Other API methods require OAuth 2.0 through a service account or a
user account.
