About serving configs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes serving configs. A serving config is a serving
entity that associates a model or a set of controls that are used to generate
your recommendation or search results.
Relationship with models and controls
When you create a serving config , you select a model
(for recommendations) or controls (for search) to
attach. Serving configs are invoked by your site when surfacing recommendations
or search results. At serving time, the serving config's associated model or
controls are referenced to determine what the recommendations or search results
generate.
Models
A recommendations serving config can have a single model
associated with it. However, any model can be associated with multiple serving
configurations, enabling you to deploy the same model on different pages using
different serving configs.
Serving controls
Search serving configs have a multi-to-multi relationship with
serving controls. You can add multiple serving controls to a serving config, and
a single serving control can be associated with multiple serving configs.
You can create serving controls and then add or swap them into a live
search serving config.
API resource and permissions
A serving config is passed into the API using the
placements resource:
Recommendations uses the URL projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/placements/ SERVING_CONFIG_ID :predict .
Search uses the URL projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/placements/ SERVING_CONFIG_ID :search .
The permissions used on these resources are the placements.search and
placements.predict permissions.
Support for placements in Vertex AI Search for commerce
The placement identifies the serving config name and the set of models to use for the search.
Serving configurations are available as of Recommendations AI v2 and
Retail Search v2alpha.
The servingConfig resource is available in the API versions
v2beta and v2alpha. You can use this resource to create, view, edit, and remove
serving configurations.
If you have existing placements, or create new placements, serving
configurations associated with each placement are automatically created.
Creating a serving configuration does not create a corresponding placement.
Deleting a serving configuration deletes its corresponding placement, and deleting a
placement deletes its corresponding serving configuration.
Serving configurations allow you to edit diversity and price reranking options and have them take
effect in near real-time. With placements, diversity and pricing settings can only be changed from
the recommendation model that the placement points to.
Placements are still supported, but using serving configurations instead is recommended. If a random serving_config_id is placed as part of the search request, search will default to essentially an empty or non-configured serving control, allowing Vertex AI Search for commerce to still work with default search capability.
Recommendations options for serving configs
The following options allow you to change the behavior of a
recommendations serving config.
These options were previously available when creating models; they are now
associated with serving configs instead.
Price reranking
Price reranking causes recommended catalog items with a similar recommendation
probability to be ordered by price, with the highest-priced items first.
Price reranking is disabled by default.
Enabling price reranking helps balance conversion rates and average order
values. Because relevance is also used to order the items returned, enabling
price reranking is not the same as sorting by price.
This option can be edited after creating a serving config.
Result diversification
If you want to ensure that results returned from a single prediction request are
more diversified rather than looking similar, you can enable diversification.
Generally, diversification reduces the likelihood that similar products are
shown in a recommendation panel, at the risk of removing some good
recommendations. Diversification settings can be edited after creating a serving
configuration. It is disabled by default.
Two types of diversification are available: rule-based diversity and data-driven
diversity.
Note:
Boost controls and diversity (rule-based or data-driven) are not compatible with each other. Only specify one of these settings at a time.
Rule-based diversity
Rule-based diversity relies on categories of your product catalog. Use
rule-based diversity to recommend products from a variety of categories.
Diversification is configured by level, with higher levels of diversification
causing fewer items to be displayed per category. This diversification type
works best if your catalog provides high-quality product categories.

Data-driven diversity
Use data-driven diversity to produce recommendations results that balance
relevance and diversity. Data-driven diversity learns from product catalog
metadata, such as titles or categories. Instead of relying on the title or
category words, data-driven diversity captures semantic similarity to produce
better-performing diversification.

Category matching
If the serving config includes a Similar Items model for
recommendations, you can enable category matching. When category
matching is used, the only product results returned are those that share at
least one category with the context product.
If your categories have deeply nested hierarchies, they are
truncated using heuristics to improve the possibility of a match. For
example, if the context product's categories are a > b > c > d > e > f , the
returned results are those whose categories are a > b > c .
Category matching can be used in combination with other filtering options, such
as price, availability, and filter tags. For example, if you use the filter tag
fall_Sale and have category match enabled, the returned results are those that
have both the required tag and a category match.
This option can be edited after creating a serving config. By default,
category matching is disabled.
Dynamic faceting search option for serving configs
You can turn on dynamic faceting when you create or edit a serving
configuration.
When dynamic faceting is enabled for a serving config,
search can automatically use attributes as dynamic facets in
search results for this configuration, based on past user behavior such as facet
clicks and views. Whether a given attribute can be used as a facet is by default
defined by the product-level attribute configuration.
Dynamic faceting settings in the API can be overwritten
by site-wide attribute controls in the Search for commerce console. See
Managing site-wide controls .
Note that dynamic facets can be created based just on accurate product catalog data.
However, for the feature to work optimally for your site, the facet models need
to learn from activity on your site. For this, you need to set query, category
and filter fields in your search event uploads accurately.
