This page describes how you can monitor A/B experiment traffic and compare key
business metrics for search in the Search for commerce
console.
Overview
You can conduct an A/B experiment to compare key business metrics between
your existing search implementation and Vertex AI Search for commerce.
After setting up the experiment and its traffic splitting, you can monitor
experiment traffic and view business metrics using the Experiment page in
the Search for commerce console.
To set up A/B experiment monitoring in the console, you input information about
your A/B test such as name, time range, and experiment arm information. Each
experiment variant arm maps to a experiment group that you have created for the
A/B experiment, where the first arm you set up in the console is treated as the
baseline control.
Each experiment has a Monitoring tab displaying traffic split metrics that
can help you determine if the A/B test is set up correctly. This is important
for validating whether bias has been introduced into the A/B test. For example, a
typical issue to look out is whether some queries or categories are served by
one experiment arm but not others.
Each experiment also has an Analytics tab where you can view key business
metrics comparisons. Two categories of business metrics are included:
Per search or per browse metrics, such as clicks per search.
Per search or per browse visit metrics, such as revenue per browse visit.
See Metrics list for a complete list of metrics.
Each business metric provides raw values, relative lift compared with the
baseline control, and a 95% confidence interval. You can view both aggregated
metrics and metrics by date.
The traffic monitoring tab displays whether unintended traffic splits have
occurred and the dates on which they occurred. An unintended traffic split is
determined by comparing the actual traffic split percentage with the intended
split percentage that you input when setting up monitoring. The traffic split is
considered correct if the relative difference is equal to or less than 10%. For
example, if traffic is intended to split evenly across two arms, an actual split
of 45% to 55% is just within the intended range.
You can use the console to monitor multiple experiments simultaneously.
The experiment date and metrics sliced by date use America/Los_Angeles as the
time zone and 12:00 AM America/Los_Angeles time for start dates and end dates.
You can update experiment details in the console such as start and end dates,
number of variant arms, experiment IDs, and intended traffic split percentage at
any time, regardless of whether the experiment is ongoing, finished, or pending.
The data is updated retroactively.
Monitoring and analyzing the A/B experiments has following
requirements/limitations:
The maximum time range of experiment data you can track is 180 days. If an
experiment started more than 180 days ago, metrics older than that are not
captured.
Per-query or per-category traffic monitoring returns only the top 100
queries or categories that get the most traffic of all variant arms in the
experiment.
Before you begin
Before you set up monitoring in the Search for commerce console for an A/B
experiment:
Set up user event ingestion for events served by your existing search
implementation and by Vertex AI Search for commerce.
Review A/B experiment best practices .
Set up the experiment using a third-party experiment platform such as
Google Optimize or
Optimizely .
Set up and note the user event experimentIds for each experiment group.
When you set up experiment monitoring, you need to specify the experiment
IDs for each variant arm.
Add an experiment in the console
Use the following procedures to add a new experiment to monitor in the
Search for commerce console:
Add experiment details
Add variants
In this procedure, you create variant arms in the Search for commerce
console that correspond to the existing experiment groups that you created in
your third-party experiment platform. For examples of how variant arms can map
to existing experiment groups, see Examples of experiment
setups .
Add experiment details
Add an experiment in the console and enter its details.
Go to the Experiments page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Experiments page
Click Add Experiment .
The New Experiment page opens.
Enter a name for your experiment.
Select the start and end dates of your experiment.
If your experiment traffic is set to ramp up gradually, set the start date to
a date when ramping up is completed and the traffic split is stabilized.
Select what kind of activity this experiment tracks:
Browse : Navigation on your site by page category.
Browsing activity is indicated by an empty
query in the search response.
Search : Text query searches on your site.
Next, create variant arms for your experiment.
Add variants
After adding experiment details in the console, create variant arms that
correspond to each experiment group.
The first variant arm that you set up is the baseline variant. The baseline
typically represents your existing solution.
Before starting, make sure you have the user event experimentIds for each
experiment group.
Click Add Variant Arm .
The Create Variant Arm panel opens.
Enter the user event experimentId associated with the experiment setup
that this variant arm will monitor:
If you are setting up your first variant arm: Enter the user event
experimentId associated with the baseline group that will serve as
your baseline.
If you have already set up your baseline variant arm : Enter the user
event experimentId associated with the next experiment group.
Enter a human-readable name for this variant arm.
This name is displayed in monitoring dashboards in the console.
(Optional) Provide a description of this variant arm.
Select a serving traffic destination:
Google Vertex AI Search for Retail API : If this variant arm monitors
traffic for Vertex AI Search for commerce results.
External : If this variant arm monitors traffic for results from an
external service. For example, the baseline (or control) variant arm
likely represents an external destination if the experiment is comparing
an existing service's traffic to Vertex AI Search for commerce traffic.
Click Create to finish creating this variant arm.
The variant arm is displayed on the New Experiment page.
Repeat the previous steps to create variant arms associated with each
experiment group you plan to monitor.
You must have at least one External arm and one Google Vertex AI Search
for Retail API
arm.
(Optional) By default, intended traffic percentage is split evenly across
all variant arms. To customize the intended traffic percentages:
Under the Add Variants section, click a traffic percentage value in
Traffic % column.
The Traffic Percentage panel opens.
In the Weight distribution field, select Custom percentages .
In the Traffic % column for each variant arm, enter its intended
traffic percentage.
The total traffic percentage across all variant arms must add up to 100%.
Click Done .
The Traffic Percentage panel closes.
Click Create on the New Experiment page to finish creating your
experiment.
The experiment is displayed on the Onboarding Experiments page.
Examples of experiment setups
This section presents two examples of experiment setups.
Example 1 shows a baseline control and one Vertex AI Search for commerce experiment
group.
Example 2 shows comparing a baseline control with two Vertex AI Search for commerce
experiment groups.
Example 1: Two variant arms
In this example, assume that you plan to set up an A/B experiment with:
20% of search requests sent to in-house search engines as the baseline
control group
20% of search requests sent to Google Vertex AI Search for Retail API as the experiment group
60% as a holdout group that is not in the A/B test
The request and user event configuration would be:

event.experimentIds
event.attributionToken

20%
Holdout traffic
Either / both
N/A
Depends on discovery engine
60%
Holdout traffic might be served by an in-house search engine,
Vertex AI Search for commerce, or both. Because they are not part of the A/B test,
they don't have an experiment ID. To indicate which user events are part of the
A/B test, make sure to provide experimentIds and attributionToken
information. Your experimentId strings might be different from those given in
this example. Make sure that the IDs you use are consistent between your
experiments and user events.
When creating the corresponding experiment in the console, you would create only
two variant arms, because the holdout group is not part of the experiment. The
intended traffic percentage split between the two variant arms is 50% / 50%.
To set up monitoring for this example experiment, you would create corresponding
variant arms in the console for each experiment group. The following table shows
information you would enter in the console during variant arm setup for this
example.
Variant arm name

Example 2: Three variant arms
In this example, assume that you plan to conduct an A/B experiment on the head
queries (high-frequency queries) and include both turning on and off dynamic
facets. The requests and user events configurations would be:
Variant arm name

event.experimentIds
event.attributionToken

Traffic metrics
An experiment's Monitoring page shows if there are unintended traffic splits
for the following metrics:
Search/Browse event count per date
Search/Browse visitor count per date
Search/Browse event count per category
When unintended traffic splits occur for one of these metrics, its card at the
top of the Monitoring page shows the dates on which the unintended traffic
split occurred. Click Unintended traffic splits to see a filterable table
listing unintended traffic splits for that metric.
The following tables on an experiment's Monitoring page compare traffic
metrics across variant arms according to usage. Click View more next to any
table title to see a filterable table listing all traffic splits for that
metric:
Search/Browse event count per date : The total number of searches or
browses that have occurred on a variant arm on a given date.
Search/Browse visitor count per date : The number of visitors who have
queried or browsed on a variant arm on a given date.
Search/Browse event count per category : The total number of times that a
given query or category has been searched for on a variant arm from the
experiment start date to its end date (or to today's date, if the experiment
is ongoing). This table shows only the top 100 queries or categories in
terms of the total traffic of all variant arms in the experiment.
Monitor an experiment
The Onboarding experiments page displays a table of your recent experiments.
To monitor an experiment:
Go to the Experiments page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Experiments page
Click the experiment name.
The Monitoring page for that experiment opens.
Review the page for unintended traffic splits.
Each metric displays the dates on which any unintended traffic splits
occurred.
If you see unintended splits, click Unintended traffic splits to see a
filterable table listing unintended traffic splits for that metric.
Address unintended traffic splits
Monitoring experiments from the Search for commerce console can help bring
your attention to potential issues in your experiment.
If you encounter unintended traffic splits, make sure events are tagged with the
correct experiment ID. For example, an event belonging to a control group being
tagged with the wrong experiment ID can cause the event to be attributed to the
wrong variant arm.
If event tagging is working correctly, unintended traffic splits reported by the
Search for commerce console can indicate traffic split issues in your
experiment platform. When this is the case, pause your A/B testing before
resolving the issue so that your experiment does not produce incorrect results.
Business metrics for analytics

Analyze experiment business performance
Each experiment's Analytics tab displays business metrics dashboards. The
dashboards show performance comparisons across variant arms.
There are two dashboards of metrics:
Per search visit and per browse visit metrics
Per search and per browse metrics
Either search metrics or browse metrics are shown based on the ProductType
attribute of the experiment.
Each dashboard displays a summary metrics table showing metrics results
aggregated across the dates shown in the date range filter. The default date
values are the experiment start and end dates.
Each metric is displayed as an aggregated
result table as well as a daily value chart that provides more detailed
information.
The aggregated table date range uses the experiment's start and end dates as
the default date values. If the experiment is ongoing, the end date is set to
the current date. You can modify the date range filter. If userAgent is
provided with ingested user events, you can also slice metrics by device type.
Click the Refresh icon to apply modified filters to metrics.
When the metrics relative lift is positive enough to exceed the confidence
interval bandwidth, a green background color is displayed for that variant.
Similarly, if the relative lift is negative enough, a red background color is
displayed for that variant. If the relative lift is smaller than the confidence
interval width, a grey background color indicates that the result does not
have statistical significance.
For example, when comparing a variant arm versus baseline control arm:
If a metric Clickthrough rate per search is +3.0%
and the confidence interval, displayed as Lift CI , is [2.1%, 4.0%], the
variant arm is highlighted in green to indicate it is a better performing
variant for this metric compared to the baseline control.
If a metric Revenue rate per browse visit is -1.5%
and the confidence interval is [-2.6%, -0.4%], the variant arm is
highlighted in red to indicate it performs worse in this metric compared
to the baseline control.
If a metric Average unit value per search is +1.0%
and the confidence interval is [-1.1%, 3.0%], the variant arm is highlighted
in gray to indicate that the difference in performance doesn't yet have
statistical significance.
Generally, the more data points, the smaller the variance is. Accumulated
metrics over a few weeks will have a lower confidence interval bandwidth than
daily metrics and are more likely to show statistical significance.
