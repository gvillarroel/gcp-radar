Additional considerations and testing
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Additional considerations must be taken into account for best practices and testing
your conversational commerce agent interface.
Implement best practices
Consider these best practices when implementing your conversational commerce agent interface:
Visitor ID consistency : Help to ensure that a unique visitor_id is consistently sent with each request for a given end user. This is vital for accurate personalization and model training. This identifier should ideally remain consistent for an end user across sessions and sign in or sign out states.
Branch management : While default_branch is common, ensure you are using the correct branch ID if your product catalog is structured with multiple branches.
Search API interaction : For SIMPLE_PRODUCT_SEARCH and any cases where refined_search is provided, remember to make a separate call to the core Search API ( SearchService.Search ) using the query from the refined_search field or the original query to get the actual product listings. The Conversational API primarily focuses on the conversational experience and user intent understanding rather than directly returning product results.
User interface design : Design your web interface to clearly present conversational_text_response , followup_question , and refined_search options in an intuitive manner to guide your user.
Configure attributes for LLM generation
To ensure that the conversational commerce agent can generate responses, attributes must be set to Retrievable in your Attribute controls .
If an attribute is Indexable but not Retrievable , the agent will find the product but cannot read the details to answer user questions. The agent often triggers a fallback response, such as Sorry, we don't have that product .
For this reason, you should set the semantic attributes ( Title , Description , Brand , Specs ) to Retrievable: True so that the LLM can use them. Set the user interface or app attributes ( BrandID , SkuID ) to Retrievable: True if your frontend requires them for rendering. Set your backend metadata to Retrievable: False to optimize context window usage.
Plan A/B tests
While relevance is an important input metric, Vertex AI Search for commerce also takes other variables into account with the goal of optimizing for business results:
Metrics
Revenue per visit (RPV)
Revenue per visit is the most effective metric for search performance as it takes into account conversion rate, AOV, and relevance.
Conversion—Average order value (AOV)
Conversion % and AOV both contribute to RPV.
Relevance—Buyability—Price
Relevance, among other inputs, is used to produce high performing search results.
A/B readiness checklist
These are the success metrics used:
Revenue per visit (RPV)
Conversation rate (CVR)
Add-to-cart events
Click-through rate
Item
Definition
Stage
Event attribution scheme
Work with Google to properly segment the user events for measurement.
Pre-experiment
Monitoring data inputs
Ability to quickly understand when training data contains anomalies that could impact performance.
Pre-experiment
Event coverage
Are we instrumenting all possible outcomes associated with search or recommendations AI sessions?
Pre-experiment
Measurable success criteria
Documented definition of done (in measurable terms).
Pre-experiment
Ability to measure UX biases
Ensure consistent UX across experiment arms.
During experiment
Coherency between VAIS data and consumption
Verify attribution tokens, filters, order by, offset, etc., are being passed from API to UserEvents. Visitor/UserIDs match between event and API requests.
During experiment
Approval to tune during the experiment
Plan for tuning activities, document changes, adjust measurements and interpretation accordingly.
During Experiment
Implement proof of concept or minimum viable product
Data ingestion
A/B test design
Performance metrics
Governance and process
Up-to-date and complete product catalog ingestion
Adherence to recommended events ingestion methods to ensure data synchronization between Google and you. Google's recommendation is for real-time event tracking, including impression data.
Pass through necessary attributes such as experiment IDs, visitor IDs, and correctly implement search tokens where applicable.
Incorporate experimentation best practices to ensure reliable results:
Verify integration.
Test a single change at a time.
Avoid aggressive caching.
Ensure web interface fairness between test and control.
Ensure traffic fairness with traffic split using visitor ID.
Ensure product data consistency.
Apply same business rules across test & control.
All evaluation criteria should be empirical, objectively measured, and driven by metrics.
Alignment on exact definitions of metrics tracked is critical to measure performance accurately.
Standard metrics tracked include:
Search CTR (results relevance)
Null search rate (intent understanding)
Revenue per visitor / Revenue per user
Number of searches to convert
Data integration, testing, feature rollout, and optimization will be an iterative process, requiring resources.
Example experiment cadence

Trained model and serving configs
Product and event data ingestion
Compare (client) data with Commerce search telemetry and adjust accordingly
Align on measurement baselines
Perform offline evaluation
Tune configurations
A/A test to verify traffic split
Obtain QA sign-off
Commit to move forward with ramp
Ongoing testing
Ramp to X% of traffic
Measure, adjust, and repeat
Ramp to X% live traffic
Continue tuning/optimization
Test incremental features
Analyze performance across search segments
Make any modeling/rules adjustments
Cross-check performance
Identify and explain anomalies
Initiate experiment
Share performance metrics daily
Perform tuning
Components of a successful experiment
Calibrate measurements and establish success criteria
Maintain experiment fairness
Monitor data quality
Plan time to verify catalog, user event, and API consumption coherency before official launch.
Establish quantifiable success criteria up front (ideally, expressed as a change to RPV).
Proactively identify and explain regressions or anomalies, then fix them.
Share measurements often, understand and document metrics definitions across experiment arms.
Minimize UX differences between segments (common layout and visuals, just different data).
Be mindful of merchandising / business rules (ensure they don't introduce bias).
Measure catalog drift.
Properly annotate experiment outcomes (by way of user events).

Conduct experiments in the console
Go to the Experiments page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Experiments page
Use the console for advanced self-service analytics for Vertex AI Search for commerce onboarding and A/B testing by applying Google's attribution methodology:
Monitor traffic segmentation, business metrics, and search and browse performance.
Apply per-search visit level metrics across both keyword search and browse.
View experiment performance as a time-series with statistical significance metrics.
Use the embedded Looker platform.
