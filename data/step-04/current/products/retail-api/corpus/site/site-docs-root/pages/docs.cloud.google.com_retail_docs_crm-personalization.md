Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This API implementation guide for Vertex AI Search for commerce outlines how to use your
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data to personalize search experiences
within Vertex AI Search for commerce. By integrating user attributes from your CRM, you can
deliver more relevant search results, ultimately improving customer engagement
and conversion. This document details the process of integrating these user
attributes, including data considerations and technical specifications.
Select data for personalization
The effectiveness of personalization hinges on the quality, coverage, and relevance of the CRM data you provide. Consider what information about a customer would genuinely influence the search results a knowledgeable sales associate might offer.
Tip: Ask yourself, Would an in-store associate show this user a different product if the associate knew this data about the customer?
When you have pilot tests complete, you will have stronger recommendations on what data is (and isn't) impactful.
Recommended data categories for impact
These data categories constitute the most telling information for your commerce site user behavior.
Geographic information : Customer location, such as state or country. ZIP code information is too granular. See the section on Excessive granularity for more information.
Demographic data : Core customer characteristics, such as age and gender.
Knowing a customer's age group (18-24 as opposed to 55-64 years of age) would likely inform different product display strategies for items like apparel or electronics. This is highly impactful data.
Customer personas : For example, a budget conscious or frugal shopper as opposed to a big spender.
Data categories less likely to be impactful
These data categories have a marginal impact on your commerce data capture.
Attributes derived from purchase history:
Our system already incorporates past purchase behavior for personalization.
Sending attributes like user bought a green dress yesterday is redundant, because this information is natively captured and utilized.
Focus on novel insights from your CRM.
Specific marketing response data, such as Clicked email #7 :
While relevant for marketing campaign analysis, it doesn't tell the AI what search result to show.
Data completeness
Beyond relevance, the completeness of your data across your user base significantly impacts its utility for personalization. An attribute is most valuable when it's available for a substantial portion of your users, allowing the system to identify broader patterns and apply personalization more widely.
Highly useful :
Attributes you have for a significant majority of your users, such as shipping_state:MA if available for 70% of your user base.
This allows for robust pattern recognition and widespread application of personalization.
Less useful :
Attributes available for only a small fraction of your users, such as hair_color:blonde if available for just 0.1% of your user base.
While interesting, such sparse data makes it difficult for the system to derive meaningful personalization signals due to the lack of sufficient examples. Instead, prioritize attributes that offer broader coverage across your customer profiles.
Data granularity guidelines
The appropriate level of data granularity is crucial for effective personalization. Data that's too broad or too specific can diminish the system's ability to identify meaningful patterns. Aim for attributes that segment your customer base into actionable groups.
Tip: For optimal granularity, strive for attributes that yield 2 to 50 distinct categories.
Appropriate granularity
Examples of appropriate granularity are fields for:
Gender
State
City
Age group (such as 30-39 years of age)
This granularity level provides differentiation for personalization without creating an unmanageable number of categories.
Insufficient granularity
An example of insufficient granularity is country:US if the vast majority of your customer base resides in the United States. This is because an attribute that has little variance across your customer base offers minimal value for personalization.
Excessive granularity
Examples of excessive granularity are:
Exact zip or postal codes ( zipcode:12345 ) : With tens of thousands of potential zip codes, most will have very few associated customers. This atomization dilutes the signal. If using zip codes, truncate them to the first two digits to achieve a more appropriate level of granularity. The first two digits of ZIP codes are approximately mapped to state-sized areas.
Exact ages ( age:37 ) : This creates an excessive number of age categories. To reduce the number, group numerical data like age into ~10 predefined bins or buckets (such as age:30-39 ).
Further data guidelines
This section addresses categorical and other data formats.
Categorical data format
This system is optimized for categorical data: distinct, named values, such as:
state:MA
gender:male
Numerical data
Key Point: The system treats all values (including numbers) as categories rather than inherently understanding numerical proximity or order. For example, age:37 , age:37.1 , and age:37.0 will be processed as three distinct, unrelated categories. The system won't infer that age:37 and age:38 are close, nor will it understand that age:37 and age:82 are distant.
For this reason, any numerical attributes such as age, income, or frequency should be grouped into meaningful buckets before data transmission.
These are incorrect and correct examples, respectively:
age:37
age:30-39
Additional data constraints
Attribute limit : Each query supports up to 100 key-value pairs . Support for more pairs may be added in future releases.
Duplicate keys : Duplicate keys are not allowed within a single query. However, multiple values per key are supported.
Prohibited PII : Under no circumstances should you send specific Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as customer email addresses, Social Security Numbers, full names, or financial data, such as credit card numbers, not in any form.
API integration and data transmission
Customer data should be transmitted within the query field of your search requests, not in the events.
Protocol buffer structure (for developers)
The user attributes are defined within the SearchRequest message as a map of strings to a StringList message.
View protobuf sample
// A list of string values.
message S tr i n gLis t {
// String values.
repea te d s tr i n g values;
}
// Request message for [SearchService.Search][] method.
message SearchReques t {
...
// The user attributes that could be used for personalization of search.
map tr i n g , S tr i n gLis t > user_a ttr ibu tes ;
}
JSON request example
This example illustrates how to structure user_attributes within a JSON search request.
View JSON sample
{
...
user_a ttr ibu tes : [
{ key : "pets" # n o te keys ca n be hashed or u n hashed
value {
values : "dog" # No te : t hese values MUST be hashed
values : "cat"
}
},
{ key : "state"
value {
values : "CA"
}
}
]
}
API response
There are no changes to the SearchResponse API when utilizing this feature. Personalization occurs internally based on the provided user attributes.
Data hashing requirements
To ensure data privacy and security, attribute values must be hashed. Keys can be sent hashed or unhashed.
Hashing keys
Attribute keys, such as pet_owner and state , can be sent in their original
string form or hashed. Both are acceptable.
For example:
Acceptable — pet_owner
Acceptable — hash(pet_owner)
Hashing values
Attribute values, such as dog and CA , must be hashed. Sending plain text values is not permitted.
For example:
Acceptable — hash(dog)
Not acceptable — "Dog"
Combined key-value hashing
If both the key and the value are to be hashed, they must be hashed independently. Do not hash the combined key-value string.
For example:
Acceptable — pet_owner:hash("dog")
Acceptable — hash(pet_owner):hash("dog")
Not acceptable — hash("Pet_owner:dog")
Best practices for data transmission
This section outlines several best practices for data transmission, including how to handle repeated values, data consistency, attribute key naming flexibility, and handling varied user profiles.
How to handle repeated values
If a user has multiple values for a single attribute, such as owning both a dog
and a cat, provide all values under a single key within the StringList .
These code samples demonstrate examples of incorrect and correct usage, respectively:
View sample
// This is incorrect because it sends the same key multiple times for different
// values, causing only one of the two values for pets to be used, choosing one
// value or the other in an inconsistent manner.
{
key : "pets" ,
value {
values : "dog"
}
},
{
key : "pets" ,
value {
values : "cat"
}
}
View sample
{
key : "pets" ,
value {
values : "dog" ,
values : "cat"
}
}
Data consistency
Maintain strict consistency in the spelling, spacing, and capitalization of all keys and values. The system interprets even minor variations as distinct categories.
For example, State:MA , state:MA , state:ma , STATE:MA , and residence_state:MA will all be treated as separate and unrelated attributes.
Caution: The same key must always be used for a given attribute.
For example:
Don't swap between pets: and pets_owned: .
Don't change spacing, punctuation, or capitalization for a given key or value attribute, after it's established.
Attribute key-naming flexibility
While consistent, the specific naming convention for your attribute keys (for
example, pet_owner , pets , codeabc ) does not inherently impact the system's
ability to use the data. The crucial aspect is the consistency of the data you
transmit.
How to handle varied user profiles
It is acceptable for different users to have different sets of attributes.
Example : User A might have age:30-39 and pet:dog , while User B has gender:male but no pet or age data. The system handles partial profiles gracefully.
Dynamic data updates
User attributes can evolve over time. You can update a user's profile with new information as it becomes available.
Example : A user initially identified with age:30-39 and pet:dog can later have state:MA added if their location is acquired.
Cross-platform consistency
Strive for consistent attribute transmission for a given user across all
touchpoints, such as mobile app or website. This ensures a unified
personalization experience.
Optimal : User A is consistently age:30-39 on both the mobile app and website.
Suboptimal : User A is age:30-39 on the mobile app, but only pet:dog on the website.
How to handle missing data
If a specific piece of information about a user is unavailable, do not send a placeholder or an empty value. Just omit that key-value pair from the request.
Example : Avoid pet:unknown or pet:
