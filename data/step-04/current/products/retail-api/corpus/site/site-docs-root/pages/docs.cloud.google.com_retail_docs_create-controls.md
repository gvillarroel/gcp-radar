Create serving controls
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create serving controls.
Serving controls are rules that you define and apply to individual
serving configs.
You can create a serving control in the Search for commerce console
consisting of a condition, which triggers the control, and an action that takes
place when the condition triggers. You can then attach the new serving control
to a serving configuration.
Relationship between serving controls and configs
Serving configs have a multi-to-multi relationship with controls. You can
add multiple controls to a serving config, and a single control can be
associated with multiple serving configs.
When you create serving controls and serving configs, you select a
product (recommendations or search) that the control can be used for.
Serving controls can be associated only with serving configs
of the same product type. For example, a serving control created for
recommendations can't be associated with a serving config
that was created for search.
Serving configs manage which controls are applied during a search or
prediction request. Only the controls on the active serving config for a
request are considered at serving time. For example, suppose you have created
two controls: a control called gShoe Sale that boosts results for the brand
gShoe when shoes is searched for and a control called More shoes that
expands queries using the term running shoes to include sport shoes. If you
attach only the gShoe Sale control to a serving config, then search requests
using that serving config boosts gShoe results for queries using the term
shoes, but the More shoes control has no effect because it is not
attached to the serving config you are using.
For more information, refer to
About serving configs .
Quickstart videos and guides
Introduction to serving controls : Serving controls enable you to create rules that customize how your serving configurations return search results.
Boost/bury : Affects result ranking and order in the returned result list.
Available for search and recommendations.
Filter : Removes results that do not pass the filter from the returned
result list. Available for search only.
Redirect : Redirects your users to a specific page depending on
the search query. Available for search only.
This tutorial shows you to how to use the redirect control.
To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the
Cloud Shell Editor, click Guide me :
Guide me
Linguistic : Customizes search query linguistics. Available for
search only.
Several types of linguistic controls are
available:
Synonym : Expands considered synonyms for a search query.
One-way synonym : Expands considered synonyms unidirectionally for
specific terms.
Do not associate : Prevent a group of terms from being used in search
when specific terms appear.
Ignore : Prevent a term from being used in searches.
Replacement : Replaces terms in the search query.
Pinning : Affects result ordering, placing a result at a specific position — for example, at position 4. Available for search and browse.
For examples of these controls, see
About serving controls .
Note: Creating chaining or conflicting controls is not recommended.
Vertex AI Search for commerce doesn't support running controls in a predetermined
order.
Serving control configuration options
You can create controls and then add or swap them into a live serving
configuration.
You can create up to 100 serving controls in Vertex AI Search for commerce. If you need more serving controls,
request additional quota. To do so, follow the steps in Increase your quotas .
A serving config can have up to
100 serving controls of any type, with the exception of search redirect controls, whose limit can be up to 1,000
per serving config. Keep in mind that your quota for controls on one serving config may differ from the overall quota allowed for a control type in your Vertex AI Search for commerce API.
Note: There is a five-minute delay from when a control is attached to ready for use in serving. The preview page and search requests will reflect this delay.
You can create a serving control in these ways:
On the
Controls page in the
Google Cloud console: Here, you can optionally create controls
during the serving config creation process.
You can use the Merchandising console .
You can create a serving control inline, using the Controls.create method.
To use the Google Cloud console to create serving controls:
Go to the Controls page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Controls page
Follow the Google Cloud console steps under each serving control section .
Control types
Controls have different requirements depending on their type. Go to the creation
procedure for the control type you plan to create:
Create a boost/bury control
Create a filter control
Create a redirect control
Create a pinning control
Create a two-way synonym control
Create a one-way synonym control
Create a do-not-associate control
Create an ignore control
Create a replacement control
Create a boost/bury control
This control type is available for search and
recommendations.
Create a search boost/bury control
Create a recommendations boost/bury control
See Boost/bury controls for more about this control type.
Create a search boost/bury control
To create a search boost/bury control:
Cloud console
Go to the Controls page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Controls page
Under the Serving controls tab, click add_box Create control .
The Create control pane opens.
In the Preferences section, in the Control name field, enter a
name for your new control.
Optional: To change the automatically created control ID, click
Edit and enter a new control ID.
In the Product selection section, select Search .
Choose Boost/bury controls as the control type. Click Continue
In the Triggers section, select what type of user behavior triggers
this control.
Browse categories : The rule is triggered when a user browses
categories on your site ( search.request.query is
empty).
Search : The rule is triggered when a user searches on your site
( search.request.query isn't empty). To set this
control to trigger when any category
is browsed, or any query is searched for, skip the following step.
Optional: Set specific categories or queries that can trigger this
control depending on whether a specific category is browsed or a specific
query is searched for.
If you chose Browse categories : In the Categories field, enter
which categories will trigger this control when browsed.
If you chose Search : Click the Add query button to add query
terms (for example, running shoes ) to be filtered. For each term, choose either Partial match or Full match .
Note: If you specify a category or query term condition in addition to a time
range conditions, the control is applied only when both conditions are
met.
Optional: Click the Add Time Range button to add one or more
time ranges during which this control can be applied.
Note: If you specify time range conditions in addition to this type of
condition, the control is applied only if both conditions are met.
Click Continue to proceed to the Actions section.
Add filters for product attributes in the Boost/bury product field.
Use the filter expression syntax documented in Filtering and
ordering . For example, to specify red and blue versions of
"product1" and "product2": (id: ANY("product1","product2")) AND
(colorFamily: ANY("Red","Blue"))
For Boost/bury value , use the slider to set the strength of the
boost. Positive values boost the results, and negative values bury
them. Click Continue .
In the Serving configs section, select which serving configs to apply
the control to.
Submit your control settings.
It takes a few minutes for newly created or updated controls to be ready to
serve live traffic. You can test if your changes have been applied on
the console Evaluate page.
You can now find the new control listed on the Serving controls tab of
the Controls page.
curl
Make a Control.create request with a control ID and an
instance of Control contained in the request body.
For field details, see the
Controls API reference and the
Controls.create API reference .
A boost/bury control can be triggered when a user browses categories on your
site ( search.request.query is empty), or when a user
searches on your site ( search.request.query isn't empty).
The following example shows fields for a browse-triggered control, where
searchSolutionUseCase is set to SEARCH_SOLUTION_USE_CASE_BROWSE .

Create a pinning control
To create a pinning control:
Cloud console
Go to the Controls page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Controls page
On the Serving controls tab, click
add_box Create control .
The Create control pane opens.
In the Control name field of the Preferences section, enter a name for your new control.
Optional: To change the automatically created control ID, click Edit and enter a new control ID.
In the Product selection section, select Search or Browse .
Choose Pinning control as the control type. Click Continue .
In the Triggers section, choose the user behavior that triggers this control:
Browse categories : Browse requests are required to have the page_categories field populated in addition to the search.request.query being empty.
Search : Search requests require only the search.request.query to be populated.
By default, all categories browsed and queries searched trigger this control.
Optional: Set a condition that triggers the rule based on a particular
category browsed or query searched for:
Browse categories : In the Categories field, enter which
categories trigger the control.
Search : To add query terms to be filtered (for example, running shoes ),
click Add query . For each term, choose Partial match or Full match .
Optional: Click Add Time Range or Add Date Range to add one or more time ranges during which this control can be applied.
Note: If you specify a category or query term plus time- or date-range conditions, the control is applied only if both types of conditions are met.
Click Continue to proceed to the Actions section. For Pin location , use the slider to specify which position the products are to be pinned to. The pin value slider won't accept values of 0, negative numbers, or non-integers.
Vertex AI Search for commerce allows 10 pins in the pin map of any single control. The position can be any value between 1 and 120 (the maximum request page size).
Note: Pins to the second page are not honored if the position is greater than the request page size. For example, if a search query requests a page size of 50 but you have set a pin to page 75, the search item will be ignored in the results.
Click Continue to proceed to the Serving configs section. Select which serving configs to apply the control to, and submit your control settings.
It takes a few minutes for newly created or updated controls to be ready to
serve live traffic. You can test if your changes have been applied on
the console Evaluate page.
You can find the new control listed on the Serving controls tab of the
Controls page.
curl
Make a Control.create request with a control ID and an
instance of Control contained in the request body.
For field details, see the
Controls API reference and the
Controls.create API reference .
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth application-default print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_NUMBER " \
--data '{
"displayName": " DisplayName ",
"solutionTypes": "SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH",
"searchSolutionUseCase": [" SEARCH_SOLUTION_USE_CASE_SEARCH "],
"rule": {
"condition": {
"queryTerms": [
{
"value": " Term1 ",
"fullMatch": " boolean: true / false "
},
{
"value": " Term2 ",
"fullMatch": " boolean: true / false "
},
],
"activeTimeRange": [
{
"startTime": timestamp1 ,
"endTime": timestamp2
},
{
"startTime": timestamp3 ,
"endTime": timestamp4
}
]
},
"pinAction": {
"pinMap" : {
" pin_position1 ": " product_id ",
" pin_position2 ": " product_id >"
}
}
}
}' \
"https://retail.googleapis.com/v2alpha/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /catalogs/default_catalog/controls?controlId= CONTROL_ID "
The pin_position should be an integer between [1,10] inclusive and product_id must exist in your catalog. The maximum number of allowed elements in the pin map is 10 for each control.
Next, attach the pinning control to your serving config:
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth application-default print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_NUMBER " \
-d '{
"controlId": " CONTROL_ID "
}' \
'https://retail.googleapis.com/v2alpha/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/ SERVING_CONFIG_ID :addControl'
In this case, CONTROL_ID should be the pinning control id you created previously.
To add a control to a serving config, use the ServingConfig.addControl
method:
For more about this method, see the
ServingConfig.addControl API reference .
For an example of this method, see
Manage serving configs .
Finally, to test your setup, make a search request. To make sure that a request will have the pinning control applied successfully, use query terms (in search) or page categories (in browse) that match the terms/categories provided in the control you created in the preceding steps.
Cloud console
Go to the Evaluate page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Evaluate page
Go to the Search tab.
Enter a test query in the search query field.
Click Search preview .
View the results to ensure that your chosen products are pinned.
curl
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer " -H "Content-Type: application/json"
--data "{'query': ' ','visitorId': ' '}" \ "https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT/locations/global/catalogs/CATALOG/placements/default_search:search"
Constraints for error checking
For error checking, keep these constraints in mind:
Two products cannot be pinned to the same position, that is, products "a" and "b" cannot both occupy position #2.
Conversely, one product cannot be pinned to more than one location, that is, product "a" cannot be pinned to positions #2 and #3 at the same time for the same query.
The product_id must exist as a product in the catalog, assuming that no filters or sorting are applied.
