About product attributes
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Vertex AI Search for commerce can use product attributes for indexing,
dynamic faceting, searchability, filtering, and model quality. This page
discusses setting product attribute configurations and how they are treated
depending on the method and configuration you use.
Attribute types
Product attributes can have different default settings and allowed options
depending on their type.
System attributes : Predefined system attributes are existing Product
fields that provide more information about the product. These include
product attributes like brand, availability, color, and size. For all
available system attributes for products, see the
Product reference documentation .
Custom attributes : Custom attributes are extra attributes that you define
using the Product.attributes field. For example, this could include store
names, vendors, or style. For examples and limits for custom attributes, see
the
Product.attributes reference documentation .
Some examples of top 20 custom attributes are:
Product line this product belongs to
Volume of in-store sales for this product
Occasion for clothing
Deals and coupons applicable to this product
Site-wide product popularity
Note: The top 20 selected custom attributes change monthly. The selected
attributes appear on the Controls page of the
Search for commerce console. Access it by clicking the Attribute
controls tab on the Controls page.
Inventory-level attributes : System or custom attributes that provide
store-level information about the product. You might use inventory-level
attributes for products whose properties vary significantly between stores and
regions, such as grocery items, or for products that have store-specific
promotions.
inventories.price and inventories.originalPrice are numeric system
attributes predefined by Vertex AI Search for commerce. You can create custom
inventory-level attributes, which can be textual or numeric. Inventory-level
attributes are indexable by default. Setting searchable and dynamic faceting
is not supported for inventory-level attributes.
Note: Providing values for predefined system attributes in Product
such as brand, color, and size is highly encouraged. You can also include custom
attributes that you define with Product.attributes .
Available attribute settings
Attribute configuration settings impact search and recommendations behavior
across your site.
Configuration
Description
System attributes
Custom attributes
Inventory-level attributes
Searchability
This attribute is searchable by search queries, which increases recall for that attribute (text attributes only).
Always on (text only)
Disabled by default (Can be enabled; text only.)
Not supported
Indexability
Search can filter and facet using this attribute.
Always on
Enabled by default (Can be disabled.)
System: always on Custom: default on (Can be disabled.)
Dynamic faceting
Search can automatically use this attribute as a dynamic facet, based on past user behavior such as facet clicks and views (text attributes only).
Enabled by default (if indexability = True ) (Can be disabled.)
Enabled by default (if indexability = True ) (Can be disabled.)
Not supported
Filterable (Preview)
This attribute can be used in Recommendations AI filter expressions. This control is applicable only for text attributes.
Disabled by default (Can enabled for text; except FulfillmentInfo and Title .)
Disabled by default (Can be enabled for text.)
Supported only for availability=IN_STOCK
Exact match
This property only applies to textual custom attributes. To enable exact-searchable, requires indexable set to enabled.
Not supported
Disabled by default (Can be enabled.)
Not supported
Search uses the following attribute settings:
Indexable : Search can filter and facet using this attribute.
Dynamic faceting : Search can automatically use this
attribute as a dynamic facet based on past user behavior such as facet clicks
and views. To enable dynamic faceting for an attribute, Indexable
must be set to true for that attribute.
Searchable : This attribute is searchable by search
queries, which increases recall for that attribute. This control is applicable
only for text attributes.
Retrievable : If set to true, search returns this
attribute in responses to search queries. If all attributes have
Retrievable set to false, the search results contain only the product name
or (for variants) the product name and color information. The REST field RetrievableFields is deprecated for products. Use the retrievable site-wide control instead.
Recommendations uses the following attribute settings:
Filterable (Public Preview): This attribute can be used in recommendations
filter expressions. This control is applicable only for text attributes.
Indexable
If an attribute is set to indexable, search can filter and facet
using the attribute.
System attributes : Indexability is always enabled for predefined system
attributes. This setting can't be disabled for system attributes.
Custom attributes : Enabled by default. You can disable indexability for
any custom attribute. If you plan to make a custom attributes indexable, it
must follow the regular expression pattern [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_]* . For example,
key0LikeThis or KEY_1_LIKE_THIS .
Inventory-level attributes : Always enabled for system inventory-level
attributes; this setting can't be changed. Enabled by default for
custom inventory-level attributes; this setting can be turned off.
Dependencies : N/A
Your index configuration changes go into effect immediately after you import catalog data. Otherwise it can take up to 12 hours or more for your changes to take effect. You can test if your changes have been applied
on the
Evaluate page.
Dynamic faceting
When dynamic faceting is enabled for an attribute, search can
use the attribute as a dynamic facet. Dynamic facets can be automatically added
to a search based on past user behavior such as facet clicks and views.
System attributes : Enabled by default if indexability is set to true. You
can disable dynamic faceting for any system attribute.
Custom attributes : Enabled by default if indexability is set to true. You
can disable dynamic faceting for any custom attribute.
Inventory-level attributes : Not supported.
Dependencies : To enable dynamic faceting for an attribute, you must first
enable indexability for that attribute.
Setting dynamic faceting for an attribute is always global. The dynamic faceting
configuration you apply to that attribute is used by products across the catalog
that use that attribute.
Dynamic faceting configuration changes take up to two days. You can test if your
changes have been applied on the
Evaluate page.
For numerical custom attributes, buckets need to be specified in the request.
Numerical values are not bucketed automatically.
Searchable
If an attribute is set to searchable, recall for that attribute in
search queries is improved.
Only textual attributes values can have searchability enabled. It is not
applicable to numerical attributes.
System attributes : Predefined textual system attributes for Product have
their searchability settings configured by Vertex AI Search for commerce. These
setting can't be changed.
Custom attributes : Disabled by default. You can enable this
configuration for any textual custom attribute.
Inventory-level attributes : Not supported.
Dependencies : N/A
Exact-searchable : Targeted search returns for search queries that match any given product in your catalog. This option works well for serial numbers. See more information about the exact-searchable option .
Although products with a searchable attribute are more likely to appear in
search results for that attribute, they are not guaranteed to appear.
Recommendations filtering
Preview: This feature is in public preview.
While there is a limit of 10 filterable attributes that can be aggregated from
variants into primary products for recommendations, if an attribute has recommendations filtering
turned on, it can be used in recommendations filter expressions to filter
products in predictions.
System attributes : Off by default. You can turn on this setting for any
predefined system textual attributes for Product , except for
FulfillmentInfo and title . Not supported for numeric attributes.
Custom attributes : Off by default. You can turn on this setting for any
custom textual attributes for Product . Not supported for numeric attributes.
Inventory-level attributes : Supported only for the availability value
IN_STOCK .
Dependencies : N/A
Exact-searchable option
You can give a certain value for specific string queries to the exact-searchable option, a catalog attribute field. If a query matches any product in your catalog where the value for that field is the string given in the query, it returns exactly that product in the search query. This option works well for serial numbers, where customers expect a targeted search experience.
Usually for custom attributes, the ExactSearchableOption field is useful for product attributes with an exact value (like ModelId or ManufacturerId ). Attributes like product_id are primary index fields—exact-searchable by default. The item_id field is always on for exact match and can't be disabled.
To avoid returning unrelated items in searches, never set the searchable option to a generic value such as battery .
To avoid under-serving search queries, don't set special fields like tag — which could have as one of its string values "iphone" — to exact-searchable. Doing so could cause those queries to limit results for all iphones in the product catalog.
For more information, see About product attributes .
Attribute configuration best practices
These best practices are important for understanding how to index your custom attributes properly, keeping in mind certain language parsing mechanisms that could affect their searchability.
Handling alphanumerics (part numbers or SKUs) : Because the default linguistic analysis optimizes for natural language, it may strip special characters like hyphens ( - ) from part numbers (such as converting part-123 to part and 123 ). To make these searchable, you must use the exact-searchable attribute flag.
The n-gram workaround : For highly complex model numbers containing special characters, best practice dictates breaking the string into n-grams in your own data pipeline prior to ingestion, and storing the original string in a custom attribute marked as exact searchable: true . This forces rigid matching against your n-gram fragments.
Custom attribute key restrictions : Custom attribute keys can't contain hyphens or special characters. To be indexable, the key must strictly match the regular expression pattern [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_]* . For more information, refer to the About product attributes page.
UTF-8 requirement : All string attributes and values must be valid UTF-8 encoded strings.
Attribute behavior
When structuring your product catalog using primary and variant product designations, know how product attributes are handled for filtering. Their behavior depends on whether you're using search or recommendations and on how you configure your catalog taxonomy.
To ensure predictable and accurate filtering behavior, maintain consistency and completeness in your filterable attribute definitions across primary and variant products. This approach aids in precise filtering, which improves product discovery and search relevance.
Primary-variant behavior in search versus recommendations
While only primary items are returned in search and recommendation results, Vertex AI Search for commerce optimizes search and recommendation quality.
For search models, variant attributes are used for the primary product in the search index. Search results display diverse options for the primary product based on its variants' attributes.
For recommendation models, product details and attributes are not inherited from primary to variant. For optimal recommendation quality, it's crucial that primary and variant products have complete and accurate details for key attributes such as product.categories , product.title , product.attributes , and product.prices .
Handle attributes during indexing and filtering
If the same attribute is defined in Primary and Variant , the attribute in the variant is part of filtering. For example, say an attribute is defined for a primary product and its variants (color or size). Variant attribute values are mainly for filtering, during which the system checks if any of the primary's variants match the attribute value. Take product availability: A primary product can be marked out-of-stock , but if at least one of its variants is in-stock , the primary is available for search results if an in-stock filter is applied.
Variant attributes take precedence for filtering. If an attribute is defined on a primary product and its variants, the attribute from the variant is used in filtering. For example, if a primary product has a placeholder color, but its variants have actual colors, the variant's color should be populated and is used for filtering.
For inventory-related attributes like availability, if a primary product has variants, the primary product's availability should be set to OUT_OF_STOCK , while the true availability (such as IN_STOCK ) should be set at the variant level. This way, the primary product is considered in stock as long as at least one variant is in stock. If so, filters such as availability: ANY("IN_STOCK") correctly return the primary product.
When a filter expression is used, the prediction response will return primary products that have at least one primary or variant product matching the filter's attribute value.
Optional attributes for filtering
Keep the categories field clean and optimized for taxonomy. If more filtering is needed, implement it based on broad categories using separate custom attributes, not in the categories field. This also avoids negatively impacting autocompletion training for category suggestions.
For example, say you typically set categories like [lvl1, lvl1>lvl2, lvl1>lvl2>lvl3] for filtering. Autocomplete counts the most frequent categories for a given query, so you end up with lvl1 and lvl2 (all your products) as suggested categories.
Attribute behavior best practices
If your catalog consists of primary and variant products and the same attribute is defined in both, the attribute in variant will be considered during filtering.
Populate attributes accurately : Ensure that both primary and variant products have complete and accurate details for their attributes, especially those used for filtering, to maximize effectiveness.
Use built-in fields : Do not rely solely on custom attributes. Map your product information to the built-in Product fields ( brands , colors , sizes , and the required fields ). Built-in fields have a greater impact on searchability, indexability, and relevance optimizations. Custom attributes ( Product.attributes ) are for product data that doesn't fit into predefined system attributes.
Set site-wide retrievable fields control : The API supports variantRollupKeys for variants, allowing you to retrieve details in search responses.
Caution: If you're using search, Product.retrievableFields , where attributes were included with a product in the search response, is deprecated. Use the retrievable site-wide control.
Consistent catalog language : The product catalog should be in one language only, and search queries should be sent in the same language. Having multiple languages in the catalog can degrade model performance. Not setting the language code can affect features like spell correction.
Price information : Accurately populate price information for both primary and variant products to ensure accurate recommendations and filtering. If a product lacks product-level pricing and relies solely on local inventory pricing, fill the primary product's pricing with the median from inventory-level pricing.
Configuration modes
The configuration mode determines how
attribute configurations are treated and which attribute configurations you can
set.
Catalog-level configuration mode (default) : In this mode,
attribute configurations on the catalog level on the catalog level are used as
the source of truth.
Product-level configuration mode (deprecated) : In this mode,
attribute configurations on the product-level are used as the source of truth.
Previously, product-level configuration was the default mode. If you are still
on product-level configuration mode and need to switch to catalog-level
configuration mode, contact Support. Search
doesn't support returning to product-level configuration mode after you have
switched.
To check the configuration mode, go to the Search for commerce console
Controls page . If the
Indexable option is available as a column on the Site-wide controls tab,
then the configuration model is catalog level. If the
Indexable column is not available on the Site-wide controls tab, then
the configuration model is product-level.
Configuration methods
You can set attribute configurations in the following ways:
The Search for commerce console : Set
attribute configurations on the catalog level using the
Search for commerce console. This configures attributes globally across
all products. Which of these settings are available in the console depends on
the configuration mode. See the next section for more details on how to configure attributes in the console .
The AttributeConfig API method : Set attribute configurations on
the catalog level using the API. This configures attributes
across all products.
The Product API method (deprecated) : Set custom attributes on the
product-level using the Product API method. Setting attributes with this
method is not available to new users and is not
recommended.
Configure attributes in the console
You can globally set attribute options across all products from the
Search for commerce console
Controls page , on the
Site-wide controls tab. For more details on how to set
this in the console, see
Manage site-wide attribute controls .
To use this feature the configuration mode must be catalog level.
Changes to attribute configuration settings for indexable and searchable take
effect immediately upon catalog ingestion. Otherwise, it can take up to 12 hours
or more for changes to take effect. You can test if your changes have been
applied on the
Evaluate page.
Configure attributes with AttributesConfig
The AttributesConfig API resource lets you manage attribute configurations on
the catalog level.
The following fields set attribute options at the catalog level:
CatalogAttribute.indexableOption : Sets the
indexable option for an attribute.
CatalogAttribute.dynamicFacetableOption :
Sets the dynamic faceting option for an attribute.
CatalogAttribute.searchableOption : Sets the
searchable option for an attribute.
CatalogAttribute.recommendationsFilteringOption
(Public Preview): Sets the recommendations filtering option for an attribute.
To retrieve all attribute configurations, use the
GetAttributesConfig method.
Update multiple attributes
Use the updateAttributesConfig method to update
multiple attributes at the catalog level.
The catalog attributes you include in the request are updated in the
catalog, or inserted if they don't exist. If there is no value for a catalog
attribute field, it is assigned a default value.
The maximum number of catalog attributes allowed in a request is 1000.
Update an individual attribute
The following methods are used to update individual catalog attributes:
AddCatalogAttribute : Adds an individual attribute configuration to a
catalog attribute.
See the API reference documentation for
AddCatalogAttribute .
ReplaceCatalogAttribute : Modifies an individual attribute configuration.
This replaces the specified CatalogAttribute in the AttributesConfig by
updating the catalog attribute with the same CatalogAttribute.key .
See the API reference documentation for
ReplaceCatalogAttribute .
RemoveCatalogAttribute : Removes an individual attribute configuration
from AttributesConfig .
Only CatalogAttributes that are not in use by products can be deleted. If a
CatalogAttribute is in use, RemoveCatalogAttribute doesn't delete it, but
resets its configuration properties to default values.
CatalogAttribute.inUse is set to True if the attribute is in use by any
products.
See the API reference documentation for
RemoveCatalogAttribute .
Deprecated
Configure attributes with the Product method
Setting attributes with this method is not available to new
users and is not recommended.
The following fields set indexable and searchable settings for a specific
product using the Product API method:
Product.attributes.indexable .
Product.attributes.searchable . Only available for
custom attributes.
Best practices for naming and structuring custom attributes
When extending your product data beyond the predefined schema, how you name and format your custom attributes directly impacts Vertex AI Search for commerce's ability to index, retrieve, and facet your products.
Follow these best practices to ensure optimal search performance and avoid validation errors:
Prioritize native system attributes first . Before creating a custom attribute, verify whether a default system attribute (such as brands , colorInfo , sizes , or materials ) already exists for your data. The backend AI models understand default fields much better than custom attributes, and heavily factor them into relevance and recall optimizations.
Example : Do not pass brand information as Product.attributes.brand . Instead, map it directly to the default Product.brands field. Save custom attributes for uniquely specific data, such as Product.attributes.sleeve_length .
Follow strict naming conventions for indexability . If you intend to use a custom attribute for filtering, faceting, or boosting, it must be marked as Indexable . To be indexable, your custom attribute key must adhere to the regular expression pattern [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_]* .
Valid naming : sleeve_length or KEY_1_LIKE_THIS .
Invalid naming : sleeve-length (hyphens are not allowed and will prevent indexing).
Limits : The attribute key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a maximum length of 128 characters. A single product can have a maximum of 200 custom attributes.
Define clear value types (text or numbers) . Vertex AI Search for commerce strictly requires that custom attribute values be defined as either textual ( text ) or numerical ( numbers ). You must set exactly one of these types for a given key; attempting to populate both text and numbers for the same attribute will return an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
Textual attributes : Allowed up to 400 values per attribute. Empty strings ( "" ) are not permitted. Each value must be a non-empty UTF-8 string with a maximum length of 256 characters.
Numerical attributes : Allowed up to 400 values per attribute.
Faceting consideration: If you want to use a numerical attribute as a dynamicFacet , you must cast the numerical data type to a Text string in your data pipeline before ingestion (such as passing 10.99 as "10.99" ). Otherwise, numerical attributes can only be used as static facets where you must manually explicitly define interval buckets in the search request.
Use exact matches strategically. The exact-searchable configuration is designed for highly specific, alphanumeric strings that lack linguistic meaning, such as model_name (such as "WA2300AH3000" ) or part_number .
Example : Do not apply exact match to custom attributes containing common English nouns or popular brands. Doing so restricts the search results when those common words appear in a search query, resulting in low product recall and negatively affecting click-through rates (CTR).
