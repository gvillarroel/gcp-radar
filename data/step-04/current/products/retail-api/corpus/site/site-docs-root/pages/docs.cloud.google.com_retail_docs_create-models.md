This page describes how to create a new recommendations model.
Note: You don't need to manually configure or create models for
search.
If you already have a recommendation model of the correct type
and you want to get predictions from it from a different location in your site,
you can create a new serving config for it rather than creating a
new model. Learn more .
Introduction
When you want to use a new recommendation type for getting predictions, you
must create a new recommendation model and provide sufficient user event data
for it to be trained. You create serving configs for your new model, and
when the model has finished training, request predictions from those serving
configurations.
For an overview of the process of working with Vertex AI Search for commerce, see
Implement Vertex AI Search for commerce .
Create a recommendation model
Add a new recommendation model by using the Search for commerce
console or the models.Create
API method .
You can have up to 20 models per project, and up to 10 of them can be active
(not paused) at any time. Learn more about pausing a model .
You can start up to five model operations per minute. Limited model operations
include creation, deletion, pause, and resume.
Before you create a new model:
Review and choose from the available recommendation model types
and model business objectives . These determine what
kind of recommendations this model should be trained to provide.
Decide how often to tune the model . For tuning and training cost
details, see Pricing .
Make sure you have enough data uploaded to meet
requirements for creating a new model . Some requirements depend
on the model type you choose.
If you plan to create a Page-Level Optimization model:
Check that you already have recommendation serving configs that have trained
models attached to them. You must provide a selection of recommendation
serving configs that Page-Level Optimization can choose from when optimizing a page's
recommendations.
Set up event recording for detail-page-view events and events that match
the page type you will deploy the Page-Level Optimization model on (for example, if you
deploy the model on a home page, make sure you set up recording for
home-page-view events). To improve personalized recommendations, event
recording for purchase and add-to-cart events is also recommended.
If you choose the conversion rate (CVR) business objective, event
recording for add-to-cart events is required.
Make sure that after creating the Page-Level Optimization model, you continue to query the
model to create recommendations impressions. These impressions are used to
train the Page-Level Optimization model and improve the recommendations it serves.
To create a new model:
Google Cloud console
Go to the Models page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Models page
Click Create model .
Enter a name for your model.
The name must be 1024 characters or less, and can contain only
alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and spaces.
Choose the recommendation type.
If you selected the Page-Level Optimization model type :
Choose the type of page the "Page-Level Optimization" model will optimize for you.
Choose how much to restrict the serving of similar serving configs
across panels:
Unique model type: Do not allow multiple serving configs with
the same model type to be shown on different panels.
Unique model: Do not allow multiple serving configs with the same
model to be shown on different panels.
Unique serving config: Do not allow the same serving config to be
shown on multiple panels.
No restriction: Allow any serving configs to be shown on any
number of panels.
For each recommendation panel you plan to show with this model:
Enter a panel ID.
Select which serving configs the Page-Level Optimization model can consider as
options for that panel.
For example, an add-to-cart page might have a recommendation panel
where you want to display either Frequently Bought Together or Others You May Like
recommendations. In this case, select a serving config that uses
the Frequently Bought Together model and another that uses the Others You May Like model for
consideration on this panel. When you make a prediction call to the
Page-Level Optimization model, it chooses which type of recommendations you should
display in that panel based on the end user's event history.
Select a default serving config.
If a Google server outage occurs, the Page-Level Optimization model can still serve
results from the default serving config.
If you need to create additional panels, for each new panel click
Add a panel and enter the new panel details.
Choose the business objective, if available for the model type you
selected.
If you chose the Frequently Bought Together model type, select the Context products type :
Multiple context products : Use one or multiple items as context for
recommendations from this model.
Single context product : Use one item as context for recommendations
from this model.
Review the Data requirements met? list to confirm that you have
uploaded sufficient data for the model type you selected.
If an unmet data requirement prevents you from creating the model, an
X cancel icon appears next to the
requirement and the Create button at the bottom of the Create
recommendation model pane is disabled.
If you need to upload more data, carefully review the data requirements
listed to make sure whether some or all of them need to be fulfilled for
that model, then import the user events or products required to create the
model
For how to import, see Import historical user events
and Import catalog information .
Choose how often to tune the model. For tuning cost details, see
Pricing .
Every three months : The model automatically tunes every three
months.
Manual tune only : The model is tuned only when you tune it
manually.
( Public Preview feature ) Choose whether to automatically generate
tags for filtering.
Auto generate tags : Turning on this option lets you filter
recommendations results from this model. Having this option turned on
can increase training time. For training cost details, see
Pricing .
Do not generate tags : If this option is turned off, you cannot get
filtered recommendations from this model.
Click Create to create the new recommendation model.
If you have uploaded sufficient user event data of the required type, the
initial model training and tuning begins.
Initial model training and tuning takes 2-5 days to complete, but can take
longer for large datasets.
You can create serving configurations for your new model
before training completes, but they will serve only
"dry run" predictions until the initial training and tuning
completes and the model becomes active.
curl
Make a Models.create request to the v2 API with an instance of
Model in the request body. See the Models.create API
reference.
For details about all Models fields, see the
Models API reference .

If you have uploaded sufficient user event data of the required type, the
initial model training and tuning begins.
Initial model training and tuning takes 2-5 days to complete, but can take
longer for large datasets.
You can create serving configs for your new model
before training completes, but they will serve only
"dry run" predictions until the initial training and tuning
completes and the model becomes active.
Requirements for creating a new recommendation model
The first time you use a specific recommendation type for your site, you are
training a new machine learning model, which requires sufficient training data,
as well as time to train and tune the model. The following steps are required to
start using a new recommendation type:
Import your catalog to Vertex AI Search for commerce, if you
haven't already, and implement processes to keep the uploaded catalog
up to date.
Start recording user events to Vertex AI Search for commerce,
if you haven't already, making sure to follow the
best practices for recording user event data .
Identify the recommendation type and
optimization objective you want to use.
Determine the user event data requirement for your selected
recommendation type and objective.
Import historical user event data to meet the minimum
event data requirements, or wait until the user event data collection meets
the minimum requirements.
Create your model and your
serving configs .
At this point, Vertex AI Search for commerce initiates model training and
tuning.
Initial model training and tuning takes 2-5 days to complete, but can take
longer for large datasets.
Confirm that your model is working correctly using
prediction preview .
Create your A/B experiment .
Model type minimum data requirements
The type of user events you import, and the amount of data you need, depends on
your recommendation (model) type and your
optimization objective . When you reach the minimum data requirement,
you can begin model training.
The data collection window represents the period for user events; importing more
historical data has no effect on model quality.
Make sure to use real user events and real catalog data. Good quality models
can't be built on synthetic data.

We recommend uploading events at least daily to maintain good data
quality. During historical event imports, make sure that data
distribution skews toward the most recent timestamp. The number of
events on the last timestamp day should be equal to or more than the
average daily event count.
