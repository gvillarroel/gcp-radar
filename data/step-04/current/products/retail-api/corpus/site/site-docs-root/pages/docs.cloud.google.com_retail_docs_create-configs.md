Create serving configs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create serving configs. A serving
configuration is a serving entity that associates a model or a set of controls
that are used to generate your search or recommendation results. For more information about serving configs, see About serving configs .
Before you begin
Recommendations and search serving configs
have different requirements and options:
Recommendations serving configs require a model. If you
plan to attach an existing model to a new serving config, get the ID of
the model you plan to use (required when using the ServingConfig.create
method).
If creating the serving config using the console, you can create a new
model during the creation process instead of attaching an existing model.
You can switch models later, as long as it is of the same model type.
Search can use serving controls, but they are not required. If
you plan to attach existing controls to a new serving config, get the
IDs of the controls you plan to use.
If creating the serving config using the console, you can also create
new controls during the creation process.
You can switch or add serving controls to your serving config after
you create it.
Create a serving config
You can create a serving config using:
The Search for commerce console .
The ServingConfig.create API .
Up to 100 serving configs are allowed per catalog.
Search works with non-configured serving configs. Any serving_config_id can be
placed as part of the search request, and this default_search will search the
catalog with Vertex AI Search for commerce default search capability.
If you have existing placements, or create new placements,
a serving config associated with each placement is automatically created.
Creating a serving config does not create a corresponding placement. Deleting a
serving config deletes its corresponding placement, and deleting a placement
deletes its corresponding serving config.
Create a serving config in the console
Add a new serving config on the
Serving Configs page in the
Search for commerce console.
To create a new serving config:
Go to the Serving Configs page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Serving configs page
Click add_box Create serving config .
Recommendations
Select Recommendation as the product the serving config
will be used for.
Provide a name for your serving config.
The name must be 1024 characters or less, and can contain only
alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and spaces.
Optional: If needed, update the ID.
The ID is generated from the name you provide, and must be unique
across your project. It must be 50 characters or less, and cannot
contain spaces.
Choose or create a model you want this serving config to
provide recommendations for.
Learn more about creating new models.
Select how much price reranking should affect recommendation results,
if available for the model you selected.
Price reranking causes recommended products with a similar
recommendation probability to be ordered by price, with the
highest-priced items first. Relevance is still also used to order
items, so enabling price reranking is not the same as sorting by
price.
Select whether to use rule-based or data-driven result diversification:
Ruled-based: Ruled-based result diversification affects whether
results returned from a single prediction request are from
different categories of your product catalog.
Data-driven: Data-driven result diversification uses machine learning
to balance category diversity and relevance in your prediction
results.
For more information, see Result diversification .
Select how much to diversify recommendation results.
If you selected a Similar Items model for this serving config, select
whether to enable category matching.
When category matching is enabled, the only product results returned
are ones that share at least one category with the context product.
Category matching can be used in combination with other filtering
options, such as price, availability, and filter tags.
Search
On the Create Serving Config page, choose Search as the product the serving configuration
will be used for.
Provide a name for your serving configuration. The name must be
1024 characters or less, and can contain only alphanumeric characters,
underscores, hyphens, and spaces.
Optional: If needed, update the ID. The ID is generated from the
name you provide, and must be unique across your project. It must be 50
characters or less, and cannot contain spaces.
Click Continue .
Choose whether to enable dynamic faceting for this serving configuration.
Choose or create serving controls to optimize your searches with. For more
information on controls, see Creating and managing controls.
Click Create to create the new configuration.
The new configuration appears in your
Serving Configs page .
It might take a few minutes for the configuration to become available for use
in search requests. It is immediately available for recommendations.
Optional: On the Serving Configs page, click a serving config name
and go to its Evaluate tab to preview the products that would be returned
for this configuration.
Evaluation preview can help you to confirm that your configuration is
performing as you expect.
Create a serving config with ServingConfig.create
You can create a serving config with the ServingConfig.create API
method. For API reference documentation for this method, see
ServingConfig.create .
Which fields you use depend on if you're creating a serving config for
recommendations or search.
For more details about the ServingConfig fields, see the
ServingConfigs API reference .
Recommendations
Make a ServingConfig.create request with a serving config ID and an
instance of ServingConfig contained in the request body.
servingConfigId : Required. Creates an ID for your ServingConfig . This
value should be 4-63 characters. Valid characters are /[a-z][0-9]-_/ .
displayName : Required. The human readable ServingConfig name displayed
in the Search for commerce console.
modelID : Required. The ID of the model to use at serving time.

results. Allowed values are no-diversity (default), low-diversity ,
medium-diversity , high-diversity , and auto-diversity . If
diversityLevel is not set, then diversity is disabled.

recommendation results based on product category. Set to
DATA_DRIVEN_DIVERSITY to diversify recommendations based on learning

If diversityLevel is set but diversityType is not set, then
diversityType defaults to rule-based. For more information, see
result diversification .
