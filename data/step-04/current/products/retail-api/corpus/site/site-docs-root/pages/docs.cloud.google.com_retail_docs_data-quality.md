Data quality
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes search use cases, their respective
performance tiers, and how to check the Search for commerce console for an
assessment of your data quality and which performance tiers you have unlocked.
Each performance tier is automatically activated when you satisfy all of its
upgrade-blocking data requirements. You must also meet the requirements for all
previous tiers to upgrade to the next tier.
Search use cases
Search provides search results for two use cases:
Text query search , used when your shoppers look for items on your
application by entering text queries and getting a set of relevant results.
Browse search , used when your shoppers land on a particular category
page, such as the "Appliances" category web page of a home improvement
store's retail site and browse the sorted items in that category.
For more about the differences between these use cases, see
About text search and browse search .
Unlock search performance tiers
Text query search and browse search have different performance tiers that
increasingly improve your search results. Unlocking performance tiers relies on
the user event and catalog data that you upload to Vertex AI Search for commerce.
The following performance tiers are available for both use cases, text query search and browse:
Text query search
TIER 1
Relevance
Results are returned based on degree of relevance to the query, such as how black a dress is when a black dress is queried.
Minimum data requirements
Catalog
Text query
Data checks
Products should have a description.
At least 95% of search requests should have query expansion enabled.
Ratio of detail-page-view events to search events should be at least 4 percent.
Products should have unique titles that are distinguishable in search queries.
Product title should contain at least 2 words.
At least 95% of products should have titles.
Products should have a valid and accessible URI.
There should be at least 5 custom searchable attributes in the catalog.
The exact match field for all products shouldn't contain any real word and it should be exactly one token.
TIER 2
Relevance and popularity
Refines TIER 1 for the most popular items in the queried search.
Equally relevant products are ranked by the popularity of the product on your site.
Data checks
Upgrade blocking to unlock Tier 2 :
At least 100,000 text search and browse events must have been imported or recorded in the last 90 days.
Performance critical :
At least 95% of events in the last 90 days should be joined with products.
At least 1.5% of search events with later pages over the last 7 days, meaning, they include all associated search result pages and their product impressions.
At least 95% of search events over the last 7 days should be associated with product impressions.
At least 10,000 detail-page-view , add-to-cart , and purchase events over the last 90 days.
At least 70% of search requests over the last 90 days should have associated events.
At least 95% search events over the last 90 days have attribution tokens.
At least 100,000 events associated with the most popular visitor ID over the last 7 days.
TIER 3
Revenue-optimized
To unlock revenue optimization, model more than 250,000 search events with at least one user interaction.
Data checks
Upgrade blocking to unlock Tier 3 :
95% of products must have a price for revenue optimization to work properly. This requires primary products or at least one of their variants to be priced. When the product goes out of stock, rather than clear the price, give the product the attribute of out-of-stock .
At least 250,000 search events must be associated with user interaction (followed by a detail-page-view , add-to-cart , or purchase event with the same visitor ID and one of the products included in the search event) in the last 90 days.
At least 250,000 search user events must have detail-page-view events that occurred immediately after the search event to meet the threshold. This metric is calculated over the last 30 days, if you uploaded more than 100 million events in that time. Otherwise, the time window is 90 days.
At least 100 products must have had at least one detail-page-view event that are attributable to a search event. This metric is calculated over the last 30 days if you have uploaded over 100 million events in the last 30 days. Otherwise, the time window is 90 days.
Performance critical :
Search events should be either associated with a query (text) or a category page (browse). There shouldn't be any search events where both are empty. Ideally, you should have a large number of search events with both fields filled.
Search requests shouldn't have an empty query. Ideally, similar to search events, search requests should have either the query (text) and the page category (browse) filled. This metric is calculated as a percentage of all search requests in the last 60 days.
At least 20 for every 1,000 detail-page-view events should be add-to-cart events from the last 90 days to meet this threshold.
For every 1,000 add-to-cart events, there should be at least 25 purchase events from the last 90 days.
TIER 4
Personalized revenue
Tier 4 builds on Tier 3 by adding personalization capabilities.
Data checks
Upgrade blocking to unlock Tier 4 :
At least 100,000 search events in the last 30 days must be served by Vertex AI Search for commerce (not a legacy engine).
Never cache personalized search results. Caching is detected when multiple search user events with different visitor IDs have the same attribution token. This metric is calculated over the 100,000 most recent search events with a Vertex AI token.
A consistent visitorId (and userId for logged-in users) must be tracked across events and search requests. There must be a more than a 10% match rate of visitor IDs between SearchRequests and user events for the most recent 100,000 user events.
Performance critical :
To improve personalization quality, at least 10% of visitor IDs should match between search API requests and search events.
At least 1% of search events should have user IDs set.
At least 1% of search requests should have a user ID set.

The Search for commerce console provides a page where you
can check if you have met each tier's data requirements.
The next sections show how to sign up for data quality alerts that notify you which of the tiers your data falls into, given your current parameters. These alerts also serve as a guide for your specific use case data requirements for best optimizing your search results.
Check your data quality
After uploading your data, go to the Search for commerce console to see data
check metrics for each performance tier for your use case.
Go to the Data quality page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Data quality page
View the data check metrics for your search use case:
For text search metrics, click the Search tab.
For browse search metrics, click the Browse tab.
Check each performance tier's score card of issues at the top of the page.
If it is labeled "In use" : You have satisfied all blocking
issues for that tier and have unlocked it.
If there are 0 blocking issues : You have satisfied the data
checks for that tier. If there are 0 blocking issues for this tier and
all previous tiers, it takes about 24 hours to train and prepare the
model and activate the newly unlocked tier.
If there are any blocking issues : Check that tier's metrics
to see which data issues to address to unlock that tier.
View each performance tier's data check metric table to see a list of
issues that can block tier upgrades or impact search performance.
Check the Status column for the priority level of each data check
metric:
Upgrade blocking : Identifies data issues that prevent
search from upgrading your use case to the next
performance tier. To unlock a tier, satisfy all upgrade blocking data
checks for that performance tier (and those of its previous tiers).
Performance critical : Identifies data issues that don't
block an upgrade, but can have a significant impact on text search or
browse search performance.
Compliant : Indicates that this data check has passed.
Unavailable : Indicates that a non-upgrade blocking data
check is not yet completed. Values for these metrics are displayed as
N/A . It can take up to 24 hours after importing data to compute
some data checks.
For more information about any metric, click Details to see a detail
panel that displays that metric's description, data check timestamp, and
threshold values.
Check the thresholds in a metric's Details panel for the values
needed to satisfy that metric's data check and improve results. Not all
thresholds apply to all metrics:
Blocking threshold : A required threshold to meet for satisfying
this metric's data check.
Critical threshold : A highly recommended threshold to meet.
Not meeting this threshold can have a significant negative impact on
performance.
Warning threshold : A recommended threshold to meet. Not
meeting this threshold can have a minor impact on performance.
To import more data to satisfy any data issues, see
Import historical user events
or
Import catalog information
in the public documentation.
Best practices
In search requests and in user events, provide user IDs in addition to visitor
IDs for signed-in users. This allows search to personalize
results for the user based on users' signed-in events across devices.
Send user events in real time instead of in batch uploads with a delay. This
helps search personalize using a user's most recent activity
on your site.
Upload all user events. For example, don't submit only events that are
attributable to searches.
Feature selection for upper revenue-optimized tiers
Vertex AI Search for commerce has been upgraded for retailers whose data has reached the upper performance tiers that unlock revenue-optimized search capabilities. These retailers in these upper tiers can now make use of feature selection:
For browse: Silver and Gold
For search: Tiers 3 and 4
Why the ranking upgrade?
Large Vertex AI Search for commerce customers have up to 10,000 custom attributes in their product catalog, while the ranking model previously had only 20 static product features (such as price and average rating) shared across all customers. This resulted in the ranking model having very incomplete product data, and no ability to customize the product features to different retail domains and use cases like fashion, hardware or home goods.
The inability to model custom attributes led some users to put the attributes they considered important into the static (fixed) product features. However, this required manual effort and clearly only worked for a small number of attributes.
Dynamic custom feature selection
Vertex AI Search for commerce has upgraded its revenue-optimized tiers to auto select custom attributes. The upgrade involves incorporating relevant custom attributes into the ranking process:
Goes through all custom attributes for each retailer and chooses the most useful ones to be added to the set of static product features.
Displays selected attributes for each retailer.
Repeats the feature selection process on a regular basis (once every 30 days).
In sum, Vertex AI Search for commerce not only gives the ranking model access up to 100 times or more potential new features to select from for the model, but each customer's attributes are also refreshed regularly to adapt to seasonal sales and other dynamic data changes.
The upgraded ranking solution provides more powerful search insights, utilizing regularly refreshed custom attributes to drive data quality.
Full product knowledge
Feature selection : The Vertex AI Search for commerce algorithm selects up to 20 most important custom attributes for each retailer.
Benefits : Improved ranking accuracy by leveraging additional information about products, such as sale codes and product or style specifications.
Visibility : Retailers can view the selected custom attributes and ensure they are maintained and up-to-date.
Customization and learning : Customers can identify patterns in selected custom attributes and add other relevant ones to further increase ranking performance.
How to see which attributes are being used
If a customer has the higher tiers enabled with sufficient user event data points, the new custom attributes information is now visible in the Console, listed under the Text search and/or Browse search tab in the Data quality page of the Search for commerce. Here, it tells you which custom attributes were chosen by the Vertex AI Search for commerce system.
Note: Attributes don't have to be searchable, but they must be in your product catalog.
Note: The number of attributes is not limited. You can add as many attributes according to your preferences. All are eligible for feature selection.
What to do with the custom attributes
Maintain and don't delete or deprecate attributes that were chosen because it might affect the model.
Improve coverage for auto selected attributes, filling in these fields for more products
Examine trends in which custom attributes are autoselected. If you have other similar attributes, add them to your catalog. They will become candidates for selection by the feature search algorithm.
Correctly annotate numeric attributes by assigning them numeric values rather than string values. For example, provide a numeric value of 10.5 , instead of text ("10.5").

Troubleshoot
Here is how to solve the following common issues.
Data check isn't passing
If a data check isn't passing, click Details for that metric on the Data
quality page to see a more detailed description of that metric and the
thresholds to meet that satisfy that data check.
If you have already met the data requirements, check the Timestamp section
for when that metric was last computed. If you recently reformatted or ingested
a significant amount of data, it might take several hours to re-compute that
metric.
If you haven't met the data requirements, you might need to reformat data or
collect more data to meet the data check requirements. After you have ensured
your data will meet the metric threshold, re-import your formatted data or
import your additional data, then wait for the metric to re-compute.
A metric value labeled as N/A
Metrics values are displayed as N/A if no data has been uploaded or if the
metrics are not yet computed. It can take up to 24 hours after importing data to
compute some data checks.
Performance tier has no blocking issues but isn't in use
To troubleshoot, follow these steps:
Check if there are any blocking data issues for previous tiers. You need to
meet the requirements for all previous tiers to upgrade to the next tier.
Wait 24 hours. After all upgrade-blocking data checks have passed, it takes
about 24 hours to train and prepare the model and activate the newly unlocked
tier.
If the performance tier isn't marked as in-use within two days of passing all of
its upgrade-blocking data checks, contact Vertex AI Search for commerce support with
your project number and project ID for assistance.
