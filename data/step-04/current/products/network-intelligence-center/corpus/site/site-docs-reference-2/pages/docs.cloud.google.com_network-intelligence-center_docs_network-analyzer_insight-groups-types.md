Insight groups and types
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes Network Analyzer insight groups and their
corresponding insight types.
The results from Network Analyzer analyses are known as insights .
An insight can include one of the following outcomes from an analysis:
A network failure, such as a service connectivity blockage caused by
configuration issues.
A suboptimal configuration, such as reserved but unassigned IP addresses, or
dynamic routes that overlap with static or subnet routes.
A preventive warning, such as IP utilization above 75 percent for a
subnet range.
A summary of status, such as the list of reserved but unallocated IP addresses
distributed by region or service projects.
Supported insight types
In addition to the Network Analyzer pages, insights are published
as the following insight types:
Recommender insight types. To request a list of insights or to list
insight details, see
Use the Recommender CLI and API .
To view all Recommender insight types, see
Recommender insight types .
Cloud Logging insight types. For details, see the
analyzer_log.proto on GitHub .
Each of the following sections provides links to the Network Analyzer insight
types. Each section also includes a table that shows the supported Recommender
insight type and subtypes and the Cloud Logging insight types.

GKE insights
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) insights cover networking issues that can impact the
operation and connectivity for GKE. Network Analyzer detects
bidirectional connectivity issues caused by configurations when a connection is
initiated between a GKE node and a GKE control
plane. Network Analyzer
also analyzes the IP utilization of GKE pods and runs a variety
of checks for best practices for GKE clusters.
