IP address utilization insights
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes the Network Analyzer insights for IP address
utilization. For information about all the insight types, see
Insight groups and types .
IP address utilization insights show the IP address allocation percentage of
subnet ranges, which are calculated based on configurations that use IP
addresses, such as VMs and load balancers. In the case of Shared VPC,
Network Analyzer provides the IP address utilization insights of the host
project, and the information from service projects is automatically aggregated
to derive the insight information.
View insights in the Recommender API
To view these insights in the gcloud CLI or the Recommender API, use
the following insight type:
google.networkanalyzer.vpcnetwork.ipAddressInsight
You need the following permissions:
recommender.networkAnalyzerIpAddressInsights.list
recommender.networkAnalyzerIpAddressInsights.get
For more information about using the Recommender API for
Network Analyzer insights, see
Use the Recommender CLI and API .
High IP address utilization of a subnet
This insight indicates that the IP address utilization of a subnet is too high
(the allocation ratio is higher than 75 percent). Such an issue can prevent
automation from creating new VMs or upgrading a GKE cluster. This
insight includes the following information:
Subnetwork: The name of the subnetwork.
Secondary range name: If the insight shows the primary range of the
subnet, this field is not displayed.
IP address range: The IP address range of the subnetwork range.
Allocation ratio: The percentage of IP addresses from the range of the
subnet that are allocated.
Resources using this range: The count of the number of
resources of this type that have allocated IP addresses within the IP
address range of the subnet. This attribute gives a summary of the number of
IP addresses used by resources such as VMs and load balancers.
The allocation ratio of the primary range includes the
four unusable IP addresses .
Recommendations
You have two options:
Expand the subnet primary ranges .
Add more secondary ranges .
IP address utilization summary
This insight gives a summary of the IP address utilization of subnet ranges in the
analyzed project. In the case of Shared VPC, Network Analyzer gives a
summary of the IP address utilization of all relevant subnet ranges of the host
project, and also provides the insights of the service projects. It includes the
following information:
All subnet ranges that have an allocation ratio more than zero.
Secondary range name: The secondary range name of a subnet. This field is not displayed
for the primary range of a subnet.
Subnet range prefix: The IP address range of the subnetwork range in CIDR format.
Allocation ratio: The ratio (between 0 and 1, 1 being 100%) of IP addresses allocated
from the range of the subnet compared to the total number of IP addresses in the subnet.
The allocation ratio of the primary range includes the
four unusable IP addresses .

Private services access IP address utilization summary
This insight gives a summary of the utilization of IP address ranges used for
private services access in the analyzed
projects. Private services access IP address ranges are used by Google Cloud
managed services such as Cloud SQL.
When you use private services access, you create an allocated
range that is
used when you create a private
connection to
the service. In Network Analyzer, allocated IP address ranges are referred
to as PSA ranges .
The managed service producer creates a subnet in a service-managed
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that is peered to your VPC network.
The service producer chooses an available IP address range for the subnet that
falls within the allocated IP address range. In Network Analyzer, the
service producer subnets are referred to as PSA subnets .
This insight includes the following information:
PSA range prefix : The prefix of the allocated IP address range (PSA
range) reserved in your VPC network for managed services.
PSA subnet prefix : The prefix of the subnet that was created from the
PSA range.
PSA subnet region : The region used by the managed service for this
subnet.
PSA subnet service : The name of the managed service that uses this
subnet. For more information about the services that support this field, see
Managed services supporting the name
field .
Allocation ratio :
The allocation ratio of the PSA range corresponds to how much of the
range is allocated to managed services. Each managed service you use
reserves one or multiple ranges of varying size, depending on the
service.
The allocation ratio of the PSA subnet corresponds to the number of
IP addresses that are allocated from the range of the PSA subnet
in the service-managed VPC network compared to the total
number of IP addresses in the range.
In the case of Shared VPC, Network Analyzer provides this insight
in the host project.
Managed services supporting the name field
The name field is populated for the following services:
AlloyDB for PostgreSQL
Apigee
Cloud Build
Cloud SQL
Memorystore for Memcached
Memorystore for Redis
Vertex AI managed notebooks
Recommendations
Review the allocation ratio for your PSA ranges and consider adding new
allocated IP address
ranges as
soon as the allocation ratio is greater than 50%.
