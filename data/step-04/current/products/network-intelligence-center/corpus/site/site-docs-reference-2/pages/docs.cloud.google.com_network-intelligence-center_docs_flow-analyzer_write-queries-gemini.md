This document describes how you can use natural language prompts to generate
SQL queries for VPC Flow Logs. To generate SQL queries for
VPC Flow Logs, you interact
with Gemini Cloud Assist
in Flow Analyzer.
Learn how and when Gemini
for Google Cloud uses your data .
Before you begin
Set up Gemini Cloud Assist
in a Google Cloud project that contains a Cloud Logging bucket with flow
logs.
Make sure that the log bucket is
upgraded to use Observability Analytics
and you have the
required roles and permissions
to query the flow logs.
Generate a SQL query
As an early-stage technology, Gemini for Google Cloud
products can generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. We recommend that you
validate all output from Gemini for Google Cloud products before you use it.
For more information, see
Gemini for Google Cloud and responsible AI .
To interact with Gemini Cloud Assist, use the
pen_spark Compose a Cloud Assist Query
prompt field. In the prompt field, you can enter a prompt or select a
predefined prompt. The following table provides examples of prompts that
you can use.
Prompt
Generated SQL query
Show me cross-zonal traffic
Selects flows where the source and destination are in
different zones.
Show me resources with SSH traffic
Selects flows with SSH traffic.
Show me the top 10 VMs with the highest traffic
Selects 10 VMs with the highest number of bytes sent.
Show me traffic from and to 10.10.0.10
Selects flows where 10.10.0.10 is the source or
destination IP address.
Show me traffic from example-instance to the internet
Selects flows from the source VM instance named
example-instance to the internet.
Show me traffic from gateways within the last three days
Selects flows within the last three days where VLAN attachments for
Cloud Interconnect and Cloud VPN tunnels are the source.
To generate and run a SQL query, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Flow Analyzer page.
Go to Flow Analyzer
Click pen_spark Compose a Cloud
Assist Query .
Describe the log data that you want to view or
select a predefined prompt.
Click Generate SQL .
Review the response and run the query:
To run the query in Flow Analyzer, click the
Explore in Flow Analyzer tab and then click
Open in Flow Analyzer .
To run the query in Observability Analytics, click the
Run SQL in Log Analytics tab and then click
Run SQL in Log Analytics .
After you run the query, you can optionally modify the populated
values as needed.
