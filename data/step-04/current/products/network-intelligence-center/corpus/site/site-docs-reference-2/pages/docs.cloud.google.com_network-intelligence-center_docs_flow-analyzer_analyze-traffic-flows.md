Analyze your traffic flows
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to query and analyze traffic flows.
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Enable VPC Flow Logs .
Required roles and permissions
Because Flow Analyzer reads data on behalf of the user, ensure
that you have sufficient permissions to read the bucket containing the logs.
The bucket must also be upgraded to use Observability Analytics.
To let a user read logs in the buckets, use the Logs Explorer page. Use
the Observability Analytics page to grant one of the following roles:
For access to the _Default view on the _Default bucket, grant the
Logs Viewer role ( roles/logging.viewer ).
For access to all logs in the _Default log bucket, including data access
logs, grant the Private Logs Viewer role ( roles/logging.privateLogViewer ).
For more information, see
Logging roles .
To let a user read logs that are stored in a user-defined bucket, grant the
Logs View Accessor role ( roles/logging.viewAccessor ). You can restrict
authorization to a specific
log view . For more information,
see Control access to a log view .
Alternatively, create a custom role that grants the
following permissions:
logging.buckets.get
logging.buckets.list
logging.logEntries.list
logging.logs.list
resourcemanager.projects.get
Build and run a query
To build and run a query using basic filters, do the following:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Flow Analyzer page.
Go to Flow Analyzer
Click settings Source bucket and do
the following:
In the Log bucket field, select the log bucket containing the
flow logs that you want to query. By default, flow logs are stored in
the _Default log bucket.
In the Log bucket view field, select a log view.
Optional: If you want to query flow logs associated with a specific
VPC Flow Logs configuration, do the following:
Select the Select specific configuration checkbox.
In the Log configurations list, select one or more
VPC Flow Logs configurations. The Flow
logs configured for subnetworks option selects all flow logs
for all subnets in the log bucket.
In the Traffic aggregation menu, select one of the following
options:
Source - Destination : aggregate the traffic from the source to the
destination.
Client - Server : aggregate the traffic in both directions by
considering the resources with lower port numbers and service
definitions or having GKE service properties as servers.
For more information, see
Traffic aggregation .
In the time-range selector, set the time range of your query. The default
time range is one hour. You can
select a preset time range, specify a custom start and end time, or select
a time range around a specific time.
In the Filter lists, select one or more query filters. Each filter
corresponds to a VPC Flow Logs field. For more information
about these fields, see Record format .
If you don't select any filters, Flow Analyzer shows the
query results for all flows within the selected period of time.
If you select more than one value for the same filter, an OR operator
is used. If you select more than one filter in the same Filter list,
an AND operator is used. For example, if you select two IP address
values— 10.10.0.10 and 10.10.0.20 —and two Country
values— usa and fra —the following filter logic is applied
to the query:
(IP=10.10.0.10 OR IP=10.10.0.20) AND (Country=usa OR Country=fra) .
Select how to organize your query results by using the
Organize flows by lists or leave the default values.
Click Run new query .
The Highest data flows chart and the All data flows table are
updated.
You can use the Display options panel to customize your query results.
For more information, see
Display options .
To select custom options, see
Customize display options .
Build and run a SQL query
To build and run a query in Flow Analyzer using SQL filters,
do the following:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Flow Analyzer page.
Go to Flow Analyzer
Select a log bucket. If you plan to use the _Default log bucket,
you can skip this step.
To set the time range of your query, use the time-range selector or
select Re-run selected period .
In the Traffic aggregation menu, select one of the following
options:
Source - Destination : aggregate the traffic from the source to the
destination.
Client - Server : aggregate the traffic in both directions by
considering the resources with lower port numbers and service
definitions as servers.
For more information, see
Traffic aggregation .
Click SQL Filters .
Enter the SQL filter query using
BigQuery SQL syntax .
To view filter expression syntax and examples, click Filter expression syntax and examples .
Organize flow by using the fields. Select a field to organize the
flow details.
Click Run new query .
The Highest data flows chart and the All data flows table are
updated.
You can use the Display options panel to customize your query results.
For more information, see
Display options .
To select custom options, see
Customize display options .
Customize display options
You can use the following modes to display and analyze data about your traffic
flows:
Data volume (default): displays bytes and packets sent.
Latency : displays round-trip time.
For more information, see
Display options .
Display flows in data volume mode
Console
Build and run a query .
In the Display options panel, review and optionally modify the
Alignment period . For more information, see
Alignment period .
Select Data volume as the display mode.
For Metric type , select Bytes sent or Packets sent .
Review and optionally modify the Advanced settings section:
The Table aggregation option: use to select which metrics
are displayed as columns in the All data flows table.
If you select Bytes sent as the
metric type, you can choose from the following options:
Total traffic : the total traffic for the selected time
period. Enabled by default.
Avg traffic rate : the average traffic rate for the
selected time period. Calculated only for the alignment periods
during which the traffic was observed.
Median traffic rate : the median traffic rate for the
selected time period. Calculated only for the alignment periods
during which the traffic was observed.
P95 traffic rate : the 95th percentile traffic rate for the
selected time period. Calculated only for the alignment periods
during which the traffic was observed.
Max traffic rate : the maximum traffic rate for the
selected time period.
If you select Packets sent as the metric,
you can choose from the following options:
Aggregate packets : the aggregate number of packets for the
selected time period. Enabled by default.
Avg packets rate : the average packet rate for the
selected time period. Calculated only for the alignment periods
during which the traffic was observed.
Median packets rate : the median packet rate for the selected
time period. Calculated only for the alignment periods during
which the traffic was observed.
P95 packets rate : the 95th percentile packet rate for the
selected time period. Calculated only for the alignment periods
during which the traffic was observed.
Max packets rate : the maximum packet rate for the
selected time period.
For more information, see
Metric aggregations .
The Sampling points option: use to select the reporting endpoint
or a combination of both endpoints:
Source endpoint : the number of bytes sent or packets sent
as reported at the source endpoint of a flow.
Destination endpoint : the number of bytes sent or packets sent
as reported at the destination endpoint of a flow.
Sum of source and destination : the sum of bytes sent or
packets sent as reported by both endpoints of a flow.
Avg of source and destination : an average of
bytes sent or packets sent as reported by both endpoints of a flow
if both source and destination details are available in
VPC Flow Logs.
For more information, see
Sampling point .
Click Run new query .
Display flows in latency mode
Console
Build and run a query .
In the Display options panel, review and optionally modify the
Alignment period . For more information, see
Alignment period .
Select Latency as the display mode.
For Metric type , select Round-trip time (median) .
For Rank flows by , select a ranking metric. This metric
defines the sort order in the All latency flows table
and determines which flows are displayed in the Highest latency flows
chart. You can choose from the following ranking metrics:
Average : sorts flows by the highest mean latency (includes
latency spikes).
Max : sorts flows by the highest latency spike.
Median : sorts flows by the highest median latency
(excludes latency spikes).
P95 : sorts flows by the highest 95th percentile latency.
P99 : sorts flows by the highest 99th percentile latency.
Standard deviation : sorts flows by the highest
variation (inconsistency) in latency.
Review and optionally modify the Advanced settings section:
The Sampling points option: use to select the reporting endpoint,
which can be either the source or the destination.
The Chart aggregation option: use to specify the calculation method
for the Highest latency flows chart. This method is applied to the
data that is selected based on the ranking metric you choose in the
Rank flows by list. You can choose from the following calculation
methods:
Average latency : calculates the mean latency
(includes latency spikes).
Max latency : calculates the highest latency spikes.
Median latency : calculates the median latency
(excludes latency spikes).
P95 latency : calculates the 95th percentile latency.
P99 latency : calculates the 99th percentile latency.
The Table aggregation option: use to select which metrics,
in addition to your ranking metric, are displayed as columns in
the All latency flows table.
The Hide flows that contributed less than option:
use to exclude low-volume flows from the query.
For example, if your query filtered a total of
1,000 logs, setting this option to 1% hides any flow that
contributed fewer than 10 logs. Setting it to 0% applies no
filtering and displays every flow regardless of its contribution.
Click Run new query .
View flow details
To view flow details for a selected flow in the data flows table, do the
following:
Console
Build the query .
Select a log bucket. If you plan to use the _Default log
bucket, you can skip this step.
To set the time range of your query, use the time-range selector or
select Re-run selected period .
Select the filters.
Select the fields to organize the results.
Run the query.
In the All data flows table, click Details for any flow. The
Flow details page that appears shows all the resources matching the
selected filters and the traffic of these resources.
Drill down traffic flows
You can further refine the traffic of the selected resources. Using
Flow Analyzer, you can drill down into the query results by using
the remaining fields available in VPC Flow Logs. For more
information, see
View flow details .
To drill down traffic flows using more fields, do the following:
Console
Build the query .
Select a log bucket. If you plan to use the _Default log
bucket, you can skip this step.
To set the time range of your query, use the time-range selector or
select Re-run selected period .
Select the filters.
Select the fields to organize the results.
Run the query.
In the All data flows or All latency flows table, click
Details for any flow.
