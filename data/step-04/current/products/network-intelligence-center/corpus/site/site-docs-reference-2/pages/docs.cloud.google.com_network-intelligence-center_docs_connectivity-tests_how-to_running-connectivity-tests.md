Create and run Connectivity Tests
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Learn how to run Connectivity Tests by following the steps on this page.
To edit or delete one or more tests, see
Update or delete tests .
To learn about Connectivity Tests, see the
overview .
Before you begin
Before you can use Connectivity Tests, set up the following items in Google Cloud:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the project selector page.
Go to the project selector
Select or create a Google Cloud project.
Ensure that billing is enabled
for your Google Cloud project.
Install the Google Cloud CLI, which is part of the Google Cloud CLI. To install the latest version of the
gcloud CLI, see the
gcloud CLI documentation .
For a list of all commands, see the gcloud command
reference .
Enable
the Network Management API . Enabling the API provides you with the following:
Example API calls that use the
Network Management API
You can test Network Management API commands by using the
API Explorer. In the Network Management API reference document,
use the Try this API column to explore API fields and
run a test .
Sample code that uses the API Python client
The example code assumes that you have constructed a resource named
api to interact with the Network Management API. To construct a resource, use the
build
function. See the following example:
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
api = build('networkmanagement', 'v1')
For more information about the API Python client, see the following:
Google
API Client Library for Python Docs in GitHub, which includes installation and authentication instructions.
The Network Management API reference
documentation for the API Python client.
Obtain the permissions that you need to run and view tests. For details, see
Assign access .
Run Connectivity Tests
When you run a Connectivity Test, you provide test inputs as
a 5-tuple without the source port .
The following sections show you how to run a test for source
and destination endpoints described in
Common use cases .
From the Google Cloud console, you can run Connectivity Tests by using either of the following:
The Connectivity Tests page, which is available from the
Networking > Network Intelligence Center menu.
The Network interface details page for a network interface of a
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance. If you use this page, you must
use the current network interface as either the Source or Destination
of the test. This page only lists tests relevant to the current network
interface.
Each test that you create runs immediately after you create it and is stored in
the Connectivity Tests resource. A test exists until you delete it.
To check the status of a test operation while the operation runs, see
Check a running test operation . Some
examples of test operations are create and rerun .
When you use an IP address for the source or destination endpoint, you might need
to specify additional fields.
Best practices
It takes between 20 and 120 seconds for Connectivity Tests
to receive a configuration update and incorporate it into analysis.
If you run a test immediately after making a configuration change, you might
not see the results that you expect. Make sure that you wait long enough
between making the configuration change and running your tests.
This delay does not apply to live data plane analysis. Therefore,
you might see a temporary mismatch between the results shown by live data
plane analysis and configuration analysis. For example, if you add a firewall
rule, it might be reachable for live data plane analysis. However, you might have
to wait for some time before the firewall rule is reachable for configuration
analysis.
List all tests for a project
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Connectivity Tests
page.
Go to Connectivity Tests
At the top of the page, in the drop-down project menu, select a project.
The Connectivity Tests page refreshes and shows you the
tests for that project.
gcloud
To list all tests owned by a project, enter the following gcloud command.
This command shows tests in the currently selected project.
gcloud network-management connectivity-tests list
To list tests in a specific project, specify the
PROJECT_ID .
gcloud network-management connectivity-tests list --project= PROJECT_ID
API
To list all existing tests owned by a project, use the
projects.locations.global.connectivityTests.list method .
GET https://networkmanagement.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global}/connectivityTests
Replace PROJECT_ID with the project ID of the
project that contains the tests that you want to list.
Python
The following example code lists all existing tests owned by a project. For
more information, see list
in the Google API Client Library for Python.
project_id = " PROJECT_ID "
parent = 'projects/%s/locations/global' % project_id
request = api.projects().locations().global_().connectivityTests().list(parent=parent)
print(json.dumps(request.execute(), indent=4))
Replace PROJECT_ID with the project ID of the project
that contains the tests that you want to list.
Test between private IP addresses in a VPC network
This example assumes that both IP addresses are private IP addresses in the same VPC network.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Connectivity Tests page.
Go to Connectivity Tests
The remaining steps appear in the Google Cloud console.
Select Create Connectivity Test .
In the Test name field, enter a name for the test.
In the Protocol list, select a protocol.

Test to or from a VM with multiple network interfaces
This section describes how to test to or from a VM's non-primary
network interface.
Console
If you specify a VM instance with multiple network interfaces as the
source or destination of a test, Connectivity Tests prompts you to
select a network interface from a list.
Alternatively, you can run a test from the Network interface details
page for a network interface of a Compute Engine VM instance. If you use
this page, you must use the current network interface as either the
Source or Destination of the test.
gcloud and API
You must specify the network interface to use for the test in one of the
following ways:
IP address and network URI
IP address and VM URI
Network URI and VM URI
Providing only the URI for a VM with multiple interfaces selects only the
VM's primary interface.
Test from a VM to a Google-managed service
This section describes how to test from a VM in your VPC network
to a service that runs in a Google-owned VPC network. For example,
you can follow the steps in this section to test
connectivity to a Cloud SQL instance or a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster
control plane .
You can also run a test by using a Google-managed service endpoint as the
source and an endpoint in your VPC network as the destination.
By default, Connectivity Tests attempts to run a test by using the private IP
address of the Google-managed service endpoint. If the endpoint does not have a
private IP address, Connectivity Tests uses the public IP address.
Connectivity Tests analyzes whether the packet can reach the endpoint, which
includes analyzing the configuration within the Google-owned VPC
network. If configuration issues are detected within your project, the
analysis stops before analyzing the Google-owned network configuration.
To test from a VM to a Google-managed service, see the following instructions.
Console
From the main Connectivity Tests page
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Connectivity Tests
page.
Go to Connectivity Tests
Select Create Connectivity Test .
In the Test name field, enter a name for the test.
In the Protocol list, select a protocol.
For Source , do the following:
In the Source endpoint menu, select VM instance .

Test from a VM to Private Service Connect endpoints
This section describes how to test from a VM to a
Private Service Connect endpoint.
For example, you can follow the steps in this section to test if a packet could
be delivered to a published service that uses Private Service Connect.
Connectivity Tests analyzes whether a packet can reach the
endpoint, which includes analyzing connected endpoints, published services,
and the proxy connection. The analysis ends early if the connection to a
published service that uses Private Service Connect is not
accepted.

Test from an App Engine standard environment version to a destination
This section describes how to test connectivity from an App Engine standard environment
version to a VM instance, an IP address, or a Google-managed service.
An App Engine standard environment app is made up of a single application resource that consists
of one or more services. Within each service, you deploy versions of that
service. You can test reachability from a version of an App Engine standard environment service
to a VM instance, an IP address, or a Google-managed service.
A Connectivity Test result might be different
for each version of the service, depending on the connectivity type and egress
settings as described in
Considerations for serverless endpoints .
You can test reachability only for UDP or TCP packets.

Test from a Cloud Run revision to a destination
This section describes how to test connectivity from a Cloud Run
revision to a VM instance, an IP address, or a Google-managed service.
You can deploy multiple Cloud Run services
in a single project. Every Cloud Run service has an HTTPS endpoint on
a unique subdomain of the *.run.app domain. Each deployment of the
Cloud Run service creates a new immutable revision. You can test
reachability from a revision to a VM instance, an IP address, or a
Google-managed service.
To see a detailed configuration
analysis, ensure that your revision is active. If your revision is configured
to use Direct VPC egress , ensure that
it is receiving traffic.
Keep in mind that egress settings
for Direct VPC egress or Serverless VPC Access
control the traffic types routed to your VPC network.
The Connectivity Test results might be different for each
revision. For example, a Cloud Run service named
cloud_run_test has a revision
first-revision configured to use a Serverless VPC Access
connector, a revision second-revision configured to use
Direct VPC egress, and another revision third-revision without
VPC access. Each of these revisions might return a different
reachability status. For example, the first two revisions might be reachable
while the third revision isn't.
When you create a Connectivity Test, you can select from a
list of revisions for a Cloud Run service.
