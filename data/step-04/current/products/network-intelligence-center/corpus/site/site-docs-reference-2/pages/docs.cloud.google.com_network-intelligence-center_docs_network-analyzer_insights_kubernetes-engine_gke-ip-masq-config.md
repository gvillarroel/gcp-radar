GKE IP masquerade configuration insights

This page describes the Network Analyzer insights for
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) IP masquerade configuration. For information about
all the insight types, see
Insight groups and types .
Network analyzer detects the ip-masq-agent configuration and compares it with
the cluster's Pod CIDR ranges.
ConfigMap is missing part of the Pod CIDR range
The
ConfigMap
for the ip-masq-agent configuration deployed on your GKE cluster appears to be
missing the Pod CIDR ranges. This corresponds to the following warning message:
Cluster's ip-masq-agent config map's nonMasqueradeCIDRs does not fully cover the Pod CIDR ranges.
This means that intra-cluster traffic among the Pods uses the source node's
IP address for Source Network Address Translation (SNAT),
which can lead to connectivity issues when a firewall or network policy
is in place.
This insight includes the following information:
ip-masq-agent ConfigMap : the
ConfigMap
of the ip-masq-agent component.
nonMasqueradeCIDRs : the field that specifies a list of destination
IP address ranges in
CIDR
format for which source IP address SNAT is disabled.
Pod CIDR : the Pod CIDR range is a dedicated block of IP addresses
that are reserved exclusively for assigning unique IP addresses to Pods within
the cluster. Every Pod that runs in the cluster receives its own IP address
from this range, which enables network communication.

Recommendations
Check the value of the
Pod CIDR
assigned to the cluster, and
edit the ip-masq-agent ConfigMap
to include all the Pod CIDR ranges in the nonMasqueradeCIDRs field.
Including the Pod CIDR ranges helps
ensure that traffic within the cluster isn't subject to IP masquerading.
ConfigMap is missing part of the Pod CIDR range and default SNAT disabled
Default SNAT
is disabled in your GKE
cluster because of the --disable-default-snat=true flag,
and the self-deployed ip-masq-agent configuration
is managing IP masquerade rules instead.
Your custom configuration for the ip-masq-agent
ConfigMap
might not properly include the Pod CIDR ranges.
This corresponds to the following warning message:
Cluster's ip-masq-agent config map's nonMasqueradeCIDRs does not fully cover the Pod CIDR ranges and the flag disable-default-snat is set to true.
As a result, Pod traffic might
not be correctly masqueraded according to your intended policy.
This insight includes the following information:
ip-masq-agent ConfigMap : the
ConfigMap
of the ip-masq-agent component.
nonMasqueradeCIDRs : the field that specifies a list of destination
IP address ranges in
CIDR
format for which source IP address SNAT is disabled.
Pod CIDR : the Pod CIDR range is a dedicated block of IP addresses
that are reserved exclusively for assigning unique IP addresses to Pods within
the cluster. Every Pod that runs in the cluster receives its own IP address
from this range, which enables network communication.
custom config : the
custom configuration
for the ip-masq-agent ConfigMap overwrites the
default nonMasqueradeCIDRs list .
Your custom configuration entirely replaces the default ranges provided by
the agent.
disable-default-snat flag : the
--disable-default-snat
flag changes the default GKE SNAT behavior so that source Pod
IP addresses are preserved for packets sent to all destinations.

Recommendations
Check the value of the
Pod CIDR
and
custom configuration
assigned to the cluster.
Edit the ip-masq-agent ConfigMap
to include all the Pod CIDR ranges in the nonMasqueradeCIDRs field.
Including the Pod CIDR ranges helps
ensure that traffic within the cluster isn't subject to IP masquerading.
