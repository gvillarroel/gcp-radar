Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes the Firewall Insights categories and states.
Insights analyze your firewall rule configuration and usage by using the
google.compute.firewall.Insight insight type.
Insight categories
Within Firewall Insights, insights fall into the two general
categories described in the following table.
Category
Description
Insights
Configuration-based
Insights are generated based on data about how you configured your
firewall rules.
Shadowed rules
Log-based
Insights are generated based on
logging about your
firewall rules' usage and information about how you configured your
firewall rules.
Overly permissive rules
Allow rules with no hits
Allow rules that are obsolete based on adaptive analysis
Allow rules with unused attributes
Allow rules with overly permissive IP addresses or
port ranges
Deny rules with hits
Each insight subtype has a severity level. For example, for shadowed rule
insights, the severity level is medium . For more information, see
Severity in the
Recommender documentation.
Insight states
Each insight can have one of the following states, which you can change as
described in the following table.
State
Description
ACTIVE
The insight is active. Google continues to update content for
ACTIVE insights based on the latest information.
DISMISSED
The insight is dismissed and no longer shown to any user on any
active insight list. You can restore the DISMISSED
state to ACTIVE on the Dismissed History page.
For more information, see
Marking
an insight as dismissed .
Shadowed rules
Shadowed rules share attributes, such as IP addresses, with other rules with
higher or equal priority, called shadowing rules . Firewall Insights
analyzes your VPC firewall rules and
firewall policies
to detect these shadowed rules.
For firewall policies assigned to a VPC
network, you can see insights into a policy rule shadowed by
a VPC rule in the same or any other policy.
Hierarchical firewall policies ,
global network firewall policies , and
VPC firewall rules are
evaluated based on the policy and rule evaluation order .
For example, in the case of global network firewall policies, you might get
insights into which global network firewall policy rule is shadowed by
a VPC firewall rule based on the rule evaluation order.
If you have firewall rules with secure tags in a global network firewall
policy, you can view insights into those rules that shadow each
other in the same global firewall policy. For more information, see
Tags for firewalls .
Firewall Insights does not identify all possible
shadowing rules. Specifically, it does not identify that multiple tags from
other firewall rules have shadowed the tags of a firewall rule.
Examples of shadowed rules
In this example, some shadowed and shadowing rules have overlapping source IP
range filters, while others have differing rule priorities.
The following table shows firewall rules A through E . For different shadowed
rule scenarios, see the sections that follow the table.

Example 1: Firewall rule B is shadowed by firewall rule A
In this example, there are two firewall rules: A and B. These rules are almost
identical, except for their source IP address range filters. For example, the IP
address range of A is 10.10.0.0/16 , while the IP address range of B is
10.10.0.0/24 . Thus, firewall rule B is shadowed by firewall rule A.
The shadowed firewall rules insight usually indicates a firewall
misconfiguration—for example, the IP address filter setting of A is broad,
or the filter setting of B is too restrictive and unnecessary.
Example 2: Firewall rule C is shadowed by firewall rules D and E
In this example, there are three firewall rules: C, D, and E. Firewall rule C
allows the ingress of HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443 web traffic and has a
priority of 1000 (default priority). In contrast, firewall rules D and E deny
the ingress of HTTP and HTTPS web traffic, respectively, and both have a
priority of 900 (high priority). Thus, firewall rule C is shadowed by firewall
rules D and E combined.
Example 3: Firewall rule B in firewall policy Y is shadowed by firewall rule A in policy X
In this example, there are two firewall rules: A and B. Firewall rule A is in
policy X associated with Folder1, whereas firewall rule B is in policy Y
associated with Folder2. Both Folder1 and Folder2 are under the same organization
node, and Folder2 is a child of Folder1. These two rules are identical
except for their source IP address range. This insight indicates that
firewall rule B in policy Y is unnecessary because it is already covered by
firewall rule A in policy X. Thus, firewall rule B in policy Y is shadowed by
firewall rule A in policy X.
Example 4: Firewall rule B in global network firewall policy Y is shadowed by firewall rule A
In this example, there are two firewall rules: A and B. Both firewall rules A and
B are in Network1, but firewall rule B is in global network firewall policy Y.
The firewall policy enforcement order of policy Y is AFTER_CLASSIC_FIREWALLS .
These two rules are almost identical, except for their source IP address range.
This insight indicates that rule B in policy Y is unnecessary, as it is already
covered by rule A. Thus, firewall rule B in policy Y is shadowed by
firewall rule A.
Deny rules with hits
This insight provides details about deny rules that had hits during the
observation
period .
These insights provide you with firewall packet-drop signals. You can then check
whether the dropped packets are expected due to security protections or whether
they result from network misconfiguration.
Overly permissive rules
Firewall Insights provides a comprehensive analysis of whether
your firewall rules are overly permissive. This analysis includes the following
insights:
Allow rules with no hits
Allow rules that are obsolete based on adaptive analysis
Allow rules with unused attributes
Allow rules with overly permissive IP address or port ranges
The data provided by these insights is from Firewall Rules Logging.
Therefore, this data is accurate only if you enabled
Firewall Rules Logging for the entire observation
period .
Otherwise, the number of rules in each insight category could be higher than
indicated.
Overly permissive rule insights evaluate TCP and UDP traffic. Other types of
traffic are not analyzed. For details, see the description of each insight.
Each insight subtype has a severity level. For example, the severity level is
high for overly permissive rule insights. For more information, see
Severity in the
Recommender documentation.
Allow rules with no hits
This insight identifies allow rules that had no hits during the observation
period.
For each rule, you can see machine learning predictions
about whether a rule or an attribute is likely to be hit in the future.
This prediction is produced by a machine learning analysis that considers the
historical traffic pattern of this rule and similar rules in the same
organization.
To help you understand the prediction, this insight identifies similar rules in
the same project as the rule that the insight identified. The insight lists the
hit count of these rules and summarizes their configuration details. These
details include the priority and attributes of each rule, such as its IP address
and port ranges.
Allow rules with no hits evaluates firewall rules that are enforced for TCP
and UDP traffic. If a firewall rule allows any other type of traffic, it is not
included in this analysis.
Allow rules that are obsolete based on adaptive analysis
This insight identifies allow rules that are less likely to be active based
on usage patterns and adaptive analysis. The insight is produced by a
machine learning analysis considering the average hit count in the last six
weeks and recent hit counts adaptive analysis. However, if the rule was never
active since the hit count tracking started, it may also be included in the
insight until it becomes active again.
For example, suppose a firewall rule was hit frequently during the last
few weeks of the observation period and stopped being hit for several days.
In that case, you might see this insight for that rule, indicating a change
in the usage pattern. However, firewall rules are analyzed to identify
those hit infrequently but active; these active rules do not appear in
this insight.
For each rule, if the machine learning analysis identifies the rule as inactive,
you can view insights based on adaptive analysis faster and before
the end of your observation period. For example, you might start getting
insights based on adaptive analysis after the first week of your observation
period, even if your observation period is 12 months.
After the end of your observation period, you can view insights based on the
data gathered through Firewall Rules Logging for the entire observation
period.
Note: If you recently enabled overly permissive rule insights, you might have
to wait a week to view insights based on adaptive analysis.
Allow rules with unused attributes
This insight identifies allow rules that have attributes such as IP address
and port ranges that were not hit during the observation period.
For each rule identified, this insight also reports the probability of whether
the rule is likely to be hit in the future. This prediction is based on
machine learning predictions that consider the
historical traffic patterns of this rule and similar rules in the same
organization.
To help you understand the prediction, the insight summarizes other firewall
rules in the same project that have similar attributes. This summary includes
data about whether the attributes of those rules were hit.
Allow rules with unused attributes evaluates only attributes that are defined
for TCP and UDP traffic. If a rule allows other types of traffic besides TCP and
UDP, the rule can be included in this analysis. However, the attributes that
pertain to other types of traffic are not analyzed.
For example, suppose that a rule permits both TCP and ICMP traffic. If the
allowed IP address range appears unused, it is not considered unused because you
might use it for ICMP traffic. However, if the same rule has an unused TCP port
range, the rule is flagged as overly permissive.
Allow rules with overly permissive IP address or port ranges
This insight identifies allow rules that might have overly broad IP addresses
or port ranges.
Firewall rules are often created with a broader scope than is necessary. An
overly broad scope can lead to security risks.
This insight helps mitigate this problem by analyzing the actual usage of your
IP address and port ranges of your firewall rules. It also suggests an alternate
combination of IP address and port ranges for rules with overly broad ranges.
With this knowledge, you can remove the unneeded port ranges based on traffic
patterns during the observation period.
Allow rules with overly permissive IP address or port ranges evaluates only
attributes that are defined for TCP and UDP traffic. If a rule allows other
types of traffic besides TCP and UDP, the rule can be included in this analysis.
However, the attributes that pertain to other types of traffic are not analyzed.
For example, suppose that a rule permits both TCP and ICMP traffic. If the
allowed IP address range appears to be only partially used, the insight does not
flag the IP address range as overly broad because it might be used for ICMP
traffic. However, if the same rule has a TCP port range that is only partially
used, the rule is flagged as overly permissive.
Be aware that your project might have firewall rules that allow access from
certain IP address blocks for load balancer health checks or for other
Google Cloud functionality. These IP addresses might not be hit, but they should
not be removed from your firewall rules. For more information about these
ranges, see the
Compute Engine documentation .
Machine learning predictions
As described in the preceding sections, two insights— allow rules with no
hits and allow rules with unused attributes—use machine learning
predictions.
To generate predictions, Firewall Insights
trains a machine learning model by using firewall rules in the same
organization. In this way, Firewall Insights learns common
patterns. For example, Firewall Insights learns about
combinations of attributes that tend to be hit. These attributes can include IP
address ranges, port ranges, and IP protocols.
If the firewall rule contains common patterns that show that the rule is likely
to be hit, Firewall Insights has higher confidence that the rule
might be hit in the future. The reverse is also true.
For each insight that uses predictions, Firewall Insights shows
details about rules considered similar to the rule identified by the insight.
For example, in the Insight details panel, you can see details about the
three rules most similar to the rule that is the subject of the prediction. The
more overlap between the attributes of the two rules, the more similar they are
considered.
For allow rules with no hits, consider the following example:
Suppose that rule A has the following attributes:
Source IP ranges: 10.0.1.0/24
Target tags: http-server
Protocol and ports: TCP:80
And suppose that rule B has the following attributes:
Source IP ranges: 10.0.2.0/24
Target tags: http-server
Protocol and ports: TCP:80
These two rules share the same target tags, protocol, and port attributes. They
differ only in source attributes. For this reason, they are considered similar.
For allow rules with unused attributes, the similarity is determined in the
same way. For this insight, Firewall Insights considers rules
similar when their configuration includes the same attributes.
