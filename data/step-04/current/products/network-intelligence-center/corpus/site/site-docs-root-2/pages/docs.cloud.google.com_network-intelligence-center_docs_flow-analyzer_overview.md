Flow Analyzer overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Flow Analyzer lets you quickly and efficiently understand your
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) traffic flows without the need to write complex
SQL queries for analyzing VPC Flow Logs.
Flow Analyzer lets you perform
opinionated network traffic analysis with 5-tuple granularity
(source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol).
Developed using
Observability Analytics
and powered by BigQuery ,
Flow Analyzer enables in-depth analysis of inbound and outbound
traffic of your VM instances. It lets you monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize
your networking deployment for better performance and enhanced security which
helps ensure compliance, and save on costs.
Flow Analyzer analyzes VPC Flow Logs data stored in a log
bucket ( record format ). To use
Flow Analyzer, you must select a project with a
log bucket that contains VPC Flow Logs. For more information, see the
VPC Flow Logs overview . VPC Flow Logs can
be used for network monitoring, forensics, real-time security analysis, and
expense optimization.
Flow Analyzer runs queries on the fields included in
VPC Flow Logs. For more information, see
Key properties of VPC Flow Logs .
In Flow Analyzer, you can do the following:
Query logs reported by VPC Flow Logs
Use SQL filters to refine your queries
Sort query results by total traffic, aggregate packets, or latency
View traffic for a specific time period
View the top five flows with the highest traffic or latency, for
the selected time period
View resources with the highest traffic or latency, for
the selected time period
View traffic details for specific source and
destination pairs in your query results
How it works
VPC Flow Logs samples packets in your VPC
network to generate flow logs, which can be stored in
Cloud Logging or routed to
supported destinations, such as BigQuery or a third-party
platform through Pub/Sub.
When flow logs are stored in Observability Analytics-enabled
buckets in Cloud Logging, you can use Flow Analyzer to query and
visualize your traffic data.
Query components
To analyze and understand your traffic flows, you must run a query on
VPC Flow Logs. Flow Analyzer helps you build the query, customize
the display options, and drill down to view and monitor your traffic
flows.
Traffic aggregation
To analyze VPC traffic flows, you must determine the aggregation approach
to filter the flows between the resources. Flow Analyzer organizes the
flow logs for aggregation in the following ways:
Source and destination : this option uses the SRC and DEST
information included in VPC Flow Logs. This view aggregates the
traffic from source to destination.
Client and server : this option tries to find the initiator of the
connection. A resource with the smaller port number is considered
the server. It also considers the resources with
gke_service definition as the servers because services don't initiate
requests. This view aggregates the traffic in both directions.
Time-range selector
The default time range is one hour, but you can select from preset time options,
specify a custom start and end time, or center the time range around a specific
timestamp by using the time-range selector. For example, if you want to view the
data for the past week, then select Last 1 week from the time-range
selector.
You can also set your time zone preferences by using the time-range selector.
Basic filters
Basic filters let you define the scope of a query. Only those flows that
match the filters that you select are shown in the query results. You
can select filters for the following:
Source and Destination (if Traffic aggregation is set
to Source - Destination )
Client and Server (if Traffic aggregation is set
to Client - Server )
Flow parameters
In each Filter list, you can add multiple filter expressions. If you select
more than one value for the same filter, an OR operator is used. If you select
more than one filter, an AND operator is used.
For example, if you select two IP address
values— 10.10.0.10 and 10.10.0.20 —and two Country
values— usa and fra —the following filter logic is applied
to the query:
(IP=10.10.0.10 OR IP=10.10.0.20) AND (Country=usa OR Country=fra) .
To build and run queries using basic filters, see
Build and run a query .
SQL filters
To build complex queries, you can use SQL filters. Using complex queries, you
can perform tasks such as the following:
Comparing field values with each other
Building complex boolean logic using AND/OR and nested OR operations
Performing complex operations on IP addresses using BigQuery
functions
The SQL filter queries use BigQuery SQL syntax. For more information,
see the BigQuery SQL syntax .
To view filter expression syntax and examples, click
Filter expression syntax and examples .
To build and run queries using SQL filters, see
Build and run a SQL query .
Query results
The query results include the following components:
The Highest data flows chart: displays the top five highest
traffic flows over time along with the rest of the traffic. You
can spot trends like traffic spikes using this chart.
The All data flows table: shows the top traffic flows up to 10,000 rows
aggregated over the selected duration. This table displays the fields
selected for organizing the flows while defining the filters for the query.
If you select Latency in
Display options ,
Highest latency flows and All latency flows are
displayed instead.
Display options
After running a query, you can refine your results by using
display options. Your selections update both the chart and the table.
Flow Analyzer provides two modes for
customizing how data is displayed:
Data volume (default): displays bytes and packets sent.
Latency : displays round-trip time (RTT).
For more information, see
Customize display options .
Data volume
The following options are available for the Data volume display mode.
Metric types
You can choose to view one of the following metric types.
Bytes sent : contains information about the payload volumes and
doesn't include headers. This metric value can be zero because some packets
have only headers and don't include any payload.
Note: You can't use this metric to estimate costs because the data is
sampled and it doesn't include headers.
Packets sent : indicates the number of packets sent from the source to
the destination.
For both the metric types, you can choose additional metric aggregations.
Metric aggregation
You can view metric aggregation in the following ways.
If you select Bytes sent as the metric and Source and destination as the
traffic aggregation, the following options are available:
Total traffic : this is always enabled by default and shows the
total traffic for the chosen time period.
Average traffic rate : shows the average traffic rate (in bytes per
second) for the chosen time period, calculated only for the alignment
periods during which the traffic was observed. For more information, see
Alignment period .
Median traffic rate : displays the median traffic rate (in bytes per
second) for the chosen time period, calculated only for the alignment
periods during which the traffic was observed. For more information, see
Alignment period .
P95 traffic rate : shows the 95th percentile traffic rate in bytes per
second for the chosen time period, calculated only for the alignment
periods during which the traffic was observed. For more information, see
Alignment period .
Maximum traffic rate : shows the maximum traffic rate in bytes per
second for the chosen time period.
If you select Packets sent as the metric and Source and destination as
the traffic aggregation, the following options are available:
Aggregate packets : shows the count of packets sent for the chosen time
period. Enabled by default.
Average packets rate : displays the average packets rate for the chosen
time period, calculated only for the alignment periods during which the
traffic was observed. For more information, see
Alignment period .
Median packets rate : displays the median packets rate for the chosen
time period, calculated only for the alignment periods during which the
traffic was observed. For more information, see
Alignment period .
P95 packets rate : shows the 95th percentile packets rate for the chosen
time period, calculated only for the alignment periods during which the
traffic was observed. For more information, see
Alignment period .
Maximum packets rate : shows the maximum packets rate for the chosen
time period.
Sampling point
For VM-to-VM network communication ,
flow logs are available (with sampling applied) at both the VMs that send and
receive traffic. If both the endpoint VMs are in subnets that have
VPC Flow Logs enabled, the same flow gets reported twice. You can choose
one of the following four approaches to determine which VPC Flow Logs
contribute to the computed metrics and how they are evaluated:
Source endpoint : the number of bytes sent or packets sent reported at
the source endpoint of a flow
Destination endpoint : the number of bytes sent or packets sent reported
at the destination endpoint of a flow
Sum of source and destination endpoint : the sum of bytes sent or packets
sent reported by both endpoints of a flow
Average of source and destination endpoint : an average of bytes
sent or packets sent reported by both endpoints of a flow if both the source
and the destination information are available in VPC Flow Logs
Traffic deduplication
To prevent traffic reported at the source and destination VMs from being
counted twice, you can choose the Average of source and destination endpoint
sampling option. Flow Analyzer identifies equivalent flows within each alignment
period and calculates the averages of the reported metrics values (bytes count
and packets count).
For alignment periods where equivalent flows are reported at both SRC and DEST,
all traffic attributed to a given alignment period is divided by two.
Latency
The following options are available for the Latency display mode.
Metric type
Flow Analyzer uses
RTT data from
VPC Flow Logs to provide latency analysis for TCP traffic.
Ranking metrics
You can rank your traffic flows using the following metrics.
This selection defines the sort order in the All latency flows table
and determines which flows are displayed in the Highest latency flows
chart.
Average : sorts flows by the highest mean latency (includes
latency spikes).
Max : sorts flows by the highest latency spike.
Median : sorts flows by the highest median latency (excludes
latency spikes).
P95 : sorts flows by the highest 95th percentile latency.
P99 : sorts flows by the highest 99th percentile latency.
Standard deviation : sorts flows by the highest variation (inconsistency)
in latency.
Sampling point
Latency is reported for both source and destination endpoints. You can view
latency values for either side of traffic flows.
Metric aggregation
The following options are available for aggregating latency data:
Chart aggregation : defines the calculation method for the
Highest latency flows chart and is applied to the data
that is selected based on the ranking metric you choose.
You can choose Average , Max , Median , P95 , or
P99 as the latency calculation method.
For example, if you rank flows by Median latency while setting the chart
aggregation to Max latency , the chart displays the highest latency spikes
for the five flows that have the highest median latency.
Table aggregation : selects which metrics, in addition to the chosen
ranking metric , are
displayed as columns in the All latency flows table.
You can also exclude low-volume flows from the latency analysis.
Alignment period
You can choose from 5 seconds to 1 day for the time range of the details in the
chart. Automatic mode selects the optimal alignment period depending on the
length of the selected period.
Every point on the timeline represents aggregated data for a specific time
period. The length of this period is called the alignment period .
The performance declines with the decrease of the value of the alignment
period. For higher values of the alignment period, the chart becomes less
granular. You might not be able to view short spikes with higher values.
For large time durations, a smaller alignment period is not helpful. For
example, if you select 1 minute alignment for a 30 day period, Flow Analyzer
generates more than 43,000 data points. Because that's 10 times more than the 4k
display pixels, you'll not be able to view all the details and some options are
disabled for large time durations.
For more information about how the sampling is done and alignment period is
determined to display the query results, see
Metrics and alignment period .
View flow details
In the All data flows or All latency flows table, click Details
for any flow. The Flow details panel appears. This panel provides
information such as the source, destination, traffic, drill down options, and
egress autonomous system (AS) paths.
Drill down view
You can drill down by splitting a selected traffic flow using an extra
field. For example, if a flow includes generic details about 1,000 GiB traffic
from Google Cloud zone X to zone Y, you can drill down using another
field such as the source IP address. The results include several IP
addresses that make up the original flow.
The fields that appear in the drill down component are selected as follows:
When you access the flow details, Flow Analyzer runs several queries.
Each query tries to drill down the selected flow using the fields available
in the VPC Flow Logs and not yet used in the original query.
For example, if the executed query already includes the IP address details,
you don't need to run the query with this field again and can't drill down
using this field.
If any of the additional queries return a single field value, it gets
added to the source and destination details section even though it is not
fetched earlier.
If any of the query results include more than one field value, the
corresponding field appears in the drill down list.
As you select a field in the drill down list, the drill down table and the chart
get updated to display the top three traffic flows.
You can also use the Compare to past toggle. Select this feature to view six
lines: three solid lines for the three top talkers from the drill down and three
dashed lines in corresponding colors representing the past traffic.
To drill down traffic flows using more fields, see
Drill down traffic flows .
Egress AS paths view
In the Egress AS paths tab, you can view the AS paths that egress packets
traverse to reach destinations outside of Google Cloud's network.
An AS path can include multiple autonomous system numbers (ASNs).
You control which AS details are displayed in the Egress AS paths tab by
using the Egress AS path filter in the Flow parameters list.
For example, the longer than and shorter than options in the
Comparator field let you specify the number of ASNs per AS path. To view
AS paths that include a specific ASN, you can use the
has first ASN or contains ASN option.
Edges on the Egress AS paths graph are weighted by the number of flow logs.
In an AS path on the graph, an edge represents the number of flow logs
containing both of the ASNs that the edge connects. Data displayed on the
Egress AS paths graph changes based on the Egress AS path filter options
and time period that you select when running a query.
Explore in Observability Analytics
You can view the raw SQL query in Observability Analytics.
For advanced analysis, you can directly modify SQL code used to visualize the
traffic. The Explore in Log Analytics feature directs you to the
Log Analytics page with a prefilled query.
