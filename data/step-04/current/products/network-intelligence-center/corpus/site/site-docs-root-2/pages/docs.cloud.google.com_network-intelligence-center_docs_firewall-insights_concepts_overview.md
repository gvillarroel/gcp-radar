Firewall Insights overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Firewall Insights helps you understand and optimize your firewall rules.
It provides insights, recommendations, and metrics about how your
firewall rules are being used. Firewall Insights also uses machine
learning to predict future firewall rules usage.
Firewall Insights lets you make better decisions during firewall
rule optimization. For example, Firewall Insights identifies
rules that it classifies as overly permissive. You can use this information to
make your firewall configuration stricter.
For firewall policies , you can get
insights into firewall rules that are associated with a firewall policy.
Note: For firewall rules in hierarchical firewall policies and global
network firewall policies, insights are generated based on firewall
logging data gathered only after February 27, 2023.
Insights
You can use insights to analyze your firewall rule configuration and help
simplify your firewall rules. Insights help you identify firewall rules that
overlap existing rules, rules with no hits, and unused firewall rule
attributes such as IP address and port ranges. You can get the following insights:
Shadowed firewall rule
insights, which are derived from data about how you have configured
your firewall rules. A shadowed rule shares attributes—such as
IP address ranges—with other rules of higher or equal priority.
Overly permissive rule
insights, including each of the following:
Allow rules with no hits
Allow rules that are obsolete based on adaptive analysis
Allow rules with unused attributes
Allow rules with overly permissive IP addresses or port ranges
Deny rule insights with no hits during the
observation period .
With these insights, you can perform the following tasks:
Identify firewall misconfigurations for firewall rules containing
IPv4 or IPv6 address ranges.
Optimize firewall rules and tighten security boundaries by identifying
overly permissive allow rules and reviewing predictions about their future
usage.
Firewall Insights uses Recommender. For more information,
see Insights .
Note: For firewall rules containing IPv6 address ranges, insights are generated
based on firewall logging data gathered only after June 17, 2022.
Metrics
Firewall Insights lets you analyze how your firewall rules are
used. These metrics are available by using both Cloud Monitoring and
the Google Cloud console.
Metrics are derived from Firewall Rules Logging. They are available only
for firewall rules with Firewall Rules Logging enabled. Also,
firewall metrics are generated only for traffic that fits the specifications for
Firewall Rules Logging. For example, data is
logged and metrics are generated only for TCP and UDP traffic. For a
complete list of criteria, see Specifications
in the Firewall Rules Logging overview.
With Firewall Insights metrics, you can perform the following
tasks:
Verify that firewall rules are used in an intended way.
Over specified periods, verify that firewall rules allow or block
their intended connections.
Perform live debugging of connections that are inadvertently dropped because
of firewall rules.
Discover malicious attempts to access your network, in part by
getting alerts about
significant changes in the hit counts of firewall rules .
Metrics are produced by Cloud Monitoring. For more information,
see Metrics, time series, and resources .
Where you can view metrics and insights
You can view Firewall Insights metrics and insights in the
following Google Cloud console locations:
On the Firewall Insights page
On the details page for a
VPC firewall rule
On the details page for a
VPC network interface
In the Active Assist
The Firewall Insights landing page in the Google Cloud console provides
cards for all the insights. You can also view the insights by using the
Recommender API or the Google Cloud CLI. You can view
Firewall Insights metrics by using Cloud Monitoring and the
Google Cloud console.
