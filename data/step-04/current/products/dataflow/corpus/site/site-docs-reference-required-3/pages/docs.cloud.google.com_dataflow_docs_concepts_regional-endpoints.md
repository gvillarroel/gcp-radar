Dataflow regions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Dataflow region stores and handles metadata about your
Dataflow job and deploys and controls your Dataflow
workers.
Region names follow a standard convention based on
Compute Engine region names .
For example, the name for the Central US region is us-central1 .
This feature is available in all regions where Dataflow is supported. To see available locations, read Dataflow locations .
Guidelines for choosing a region
Use the following guidelines to choose an appropriate region for your job.
Security and compliance
You might need to constrain Dataflow job processing to a specific
geographic region in support of the security and compliance needs of your project.
Data locality
You can minimize network latency and network transport costs by running a
Dataflow job from the same region as its sources, sinks, staging file locations,
and temporary file locations. If you use sources, sinks, staging file locations,
or temporary file locations that are located outside of your job's region,
your data might be sent across regions.
Note: Starting with Beam SDK version 2.44.0, Dataflow does not
support running jobs with workers in a region that is different from the
job region.
In running a pipeline, user data is only handled by the Dataflow worker pool
and the movement of the data is restricted to the network paths that connect
the Dataflow workers in the pool.
Although user data is strictly handled by Dataflow workers in their
assigned geographic region, pipeline log messages are stored in
Cloud Logging , which has a single global presence in
Google Cloud.
If you need more control over the location of pipeline log messages, you can do the following:
Create an exclusion filter
for the _Default log router sink to prevent Dataflow logs from being exported to the _Default log bucket.
Create a log bucket in the region of your choice.
Configure a new log router sink that exports your Dataflow logs to your new log bucket.
To learn more about configuring logging, see
Routing and storage overview
and Log routing overview .
Notes about common Dataflow job sources:
When using a Cloud Storage bucket as a source, we recommend that you
perform read operations in the same
region as the bucket .
Pub/Sub topics, when published to the global
Pub/Sub endpoint, are stored in the nearest Google Cloud region.
However, you can modify the topic storage policy to a specific
region or a set of regions .
Similarly,
Pub/Sub Lite
topics support only zonal storage.
Resilience and geographic separation
You might want to isolate your normal Dataflow operations from
outages that could occur in other geographic regions .
Or, you might need to plan alternate sites for business continuity in the event
of a region-wide disaster.
In your disaster recovery and business continuity plans ,
we recommend incorporating details for sources and sinks used with your
Dataflow jobs. The Google Cloud sales team can
help you work towards meeting your requirements.
Regional placement
By default, the region that you select configures the Dataflow
worker pool to utilize all available zones within the region. Zone selection is
calculated for each worker at its creation time, optimizing for resource
acquisition and utilization of unused
reservations .
Regional placement offers benefits such as:
Improved resource availability: Dataflow jobs are more
resilient to
zonal resource availability
errors, because workers can continue to be created in other zones with
remaining availability.
Improved reliability: In the event of a zonal failure, Dataflow
jobs can continue to run, because workers are recreated in other zones.
The following limitations apply:
Regional placement is supported only for jobs using Streaming Engine or
Dataflow Shuffle. Jobs that have opted out of Streaming Engine
or Dataflow Shuffle cannot use regional placement.
Regional placement applies to VMs only, and doesn't apply to backend resources.
VMs are not replicated across multiple zones. If a VM becomes unavailable,
for example, its work items are considered lost and are reprocessed by another VM.
If Compute Engine does not have capacity in the configured region,
the Dataflow service cannot create any more VMs.
If Compute Engine does not have capacity in one or more zones in the
configured region, the Dataflow service might fail to start a
job.
View job resource zones
Dataflow jobs depend on internal resources. Some of these
backend job resources are zonal. If a single zone fails and a zonal resource necessary
for your Dataflow job is in that zone, the job might fail.
To understand whether a job failed because of a zonal outage,
review the service zones that your job's backend resources are using.
This feature is only available
for Streaming Engine jobs.
To view the service zones in the
Google Cloud console, use the Service zones field in the
Job info panel.
To use the API to review the service zones, use the
ServiceResources
field.
The values in this field update throughout the duration of
the job, because the resources that the job uses change while the job runs.
Automatic zone placement
For jobs not supported for regional placement, the best zone within the region
is selected automatically, based on the available
zone capacity at the time of the job creation request. Automatic zone selection
helps ensure that job workers run in the best zone for your job.
Because the job is configured to run in a single zone, the operation might fail
with a
zonal resource availability
error if sufficient Compute Engine resources are not available.
If capacity is exhausted in a region, you might see a
ZONE_RESOURCE_POOL_EXHAUSTED
error. You can implement a retry loop to start the job when resources are
available.
Also, when a zone is unavailable, the streaming backend can also become
unavailable, which might result in data loss.
Specify a region
Note: Region configuration requires
Apache Beam SDK version 2.0.0 or higher.
To specify a region for your job, set the --region option to one of
the supported regions.
The --region option overrides the default region that is set in the metadata
server, your local client, or the environment variables.
The Dataflow command-line interface
also supports the --region option to specify regions.
Override the worker region or zone
By default, when you submit a job with the --region option,
workers are automatically assigned to
either zones across the region or the
single best zone within the region, depending on the job type.
In cases where you want to ensure that the workers for your
Dataflow job run strictly in a specific zone, you can specify
the zone using the following
pipeline option .
This usage pattern is uncommon for Dataflow jobs.
This option only controls the zone used for the Dataflow workers.
It doesn't apply to backend
resources. Backend resources might be created in any zone within the job region.
Java
--workerZone
Python
--worker_zone
Go
--worker_zone
For all other cases, we don't recommend overriding the worker location. The
common scenarios table contains usage recommendations
for these situations.
Because the job is configured to run in a single zone, the operation might fail
with a
zonal resource availability
error if sufficient Compute Engine resources are not available.
Caution: If you override the worker zone and the workers are in a different
region than the job region, there might be a negative impact on performance,
network traffic, network latency, and network cost.
You can run the gcloud compute regions list command to see a listing of
regions and zones that are available for worker deployment.
Common scenarios
The following table contains usage recommendations for common scenarios.
Scenario
Recommendation
I want to use a supported region and have no zone preference
within the region. In this case, the best zone is automatically
selected based on available capacity.
Use --region to specify a job region.
This ensures that Dataflow manages your job and processes
data within the specified region.
I need worker processing to occur in a specific zone of a region.
Specify both --region and either --workerZone or
--worker_zone .
Use --region to specify the job region. Use either
--workerZone or --worker_zone to specify the
specific zone
within that region.
