Configure internet access and firewall rules
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document explains how to complete the following tasks:
Configure Dataflow virtual machine (VM) instances for internet access
Use tags to secure worker VM networking.
Define firewall rules for the network associated with your Dataflow jobs
This document requires that you have basic knowledge of Google Cloud networks.
To define a network for your Dataflow job, see
Specify your network and subnetwork .
For more information about how to troubleshoot networking issues, see
Troubleshoot Dataflow networking issues .
Note: The default network has configurations
that allow Dataflow jobs to run. However, other services might
also use this network. Make sure your changes to the default network are
compatible with all of your services. Alternatively, create a separate network
for Dataflow.
Access to Google Cloud APIs for Dataflow
Dataflow worker virtual machines (VMs) must reach
Google Cloud APIs and services. The set of
dependent Google Cloud endpoints might change over time, but they all
support VPC Service Controls. Use one of the following methods to
configure access to Google Cloud APIs:
Configure Private Google Access . With
Private Google Access, VMs that have only internal IP addresses can
access IP addresses for Google Cloud and services.
Configure a
Private Service Connect endpoint IP address
to access Google Cloud APIs and services.
Configure worker VMs with
external IP addresses.
By default, firewall rules and DNS configurations allow access to
Google Cloud APIs. However, you might be actively restricting access to
a subset of Google Cloud APIs, such as if you're using
VPC Service Controls .
In this case, at a minimum, provide access to
restricted.googleapis.com . If you're using Private Service Connect,
provide access to the vpc-sc bundle .
Providing access to more permissive
domains , such as
private.googleapis.com , also provides the required functionality.
To allow access to the necessary Google Cloud APIs through a given
domain, your environment must meet the following requirements:
Firewall rules must allow egress to all address ranges under the chosen domain.
DNS must resolve *.googleapis.com to your chosen domain.
For example, if your firewall rules limit egress to the
restricted.googleapis.com address range, then
*.googleapis.com must resolve to addresses within that range.
For more information, see
Configure DNS for googleapis.com .
Similarly, if you're using Private Service Connect,
then you must create DNS records
for the googleapis.com default domain to ensure access to at least
all services in the vpc-sc
bundle .
Internet access for Dataflow
Depending on your use case, your VMs might also need access to resources outside
Google Cloud. Use one of the following methods to configure internet access for
Dataflow:
Configure worker VMs with
an external IP address so that they meet the
internet access requirements .
Configure a NAT solution, such as
Cloud NAT . This option is for running jobs that access
APIs and services outside of Google Cloud that require internet access.
For example, Python SDK jobs might require access to the Python Package Index
(PyPI) to download pipelines dependencies. In
this case, you must either configure worker VMs with external IP addresses or
use Cloud NAT. You can also supply Python pipeline dependencies
during job submission. For example, you can use custom containers
to supply Python pipeline dependencies, which
removes the need to access PyPI at runtime.
For more information, see
Managing Python Pipeline Dependencies
in the Apache Beam documentation.
Turn off external IP address
By default, Dataflow assigns both external and internal IP
addresses to workers. When you turn off external IP addresses,
the Dataflow job can only access resources in the following places:
Another instance in the same VPC network
A Shared VPC network
A network with VPC Network Peering enabled
Without external IP addresses, you can still perform administrative and
monitoring tasks. You can access your workers by using SSH through the options
listed in the preceding list. However, the pipeline cannot access the internet,
and internet hosts cannot access your Dataflow workers.
By not using external IP addresses, you can better secure your data processing
infrastructure. You can also reduce the number of external IP addresses
that you consume against your Google Cloud
project quota .
If you turn off external IP addresses, your Dataflow jobs cannot
access APIs and services outside of Google Cloud that require internet
access.
To turn off external IP addresses, do one of the following:
Java
Enable Private Google Access for your
network or subnetwork.
In the parameters of your Dataflow job, specify --usePublicIps=false
and --network= NETWORK-NAME or --subnetwork= SUBNETWORK-NAME .
Depending on your choice, replace one of the following:
NETWORK-NAME : the name of your Compute Engine network
SUBNETWORK-NAME : the name of your Compute Engine subnetwork
Python
To stage all Python package dependencies, follow the Apache Beam pipeline dependencies instructions .
Enable Private Google Access for your
network or subnetwork.
In the parameters of your Dataflow job, specify --no_use_public_ips
and --network= NETWORK or --subnetwork= SUBNETWORK .
Depending on your choice, replace one of the following:
NETWORK-NAME : the name of your Compute Engine network
SUBNETWORK-NAME : the name of your Compute Engine subnetwork
Go
Enable Private Google Access for your
network or subnetwork.
In the parameters of your Dataflow job, specify --no_use_public_ips
and --network= NETWORK or --subnetwork= SUBNETWORK .
Depending on your choice, replace one of the following:
NETWORK-NAME : the name of your Compute Engine network
SUBNETWORK-NAME : the name of your Compute Engine subnetwork
Use tags to secure worker VM networking
Tags let you apply network firewall rules to specific VM instances. When you run
a Dataflow job, you can specify tags for the
Dataflow worker VMs that execute the job. Any firewall rules for
those tags are then applied to the Dataflow worker VMs.
Dataflow supports two types of tags for VM networking:
Secure tags
Network tags
Use secure tags with Dataflow
Secure tags , also called
Identity and Access Management (IAM)-governed tags, are key-value pairs that you create
and manage in Resource Manager. Unlike network tags, secure tags support access
control using IAM.
The benefits of using secure tags, instead of network tags, include the
following:
Secure tags prevent unauthorized modification of tags and the resulting
unwanted changes to firewall rules.
The global and
regional network firewall
policies support secure tags. By using secure tags, you can group multiple
firewall rules and update them simultaneously, with the updates governed by
IAM access controls.
Secure tags inherit from parent resources in the Google Cloud hierarchy,
which lets you define tags at higher levels, such as the organization level.
For more information, see
Tag inheritance .
With secure tags, ingress firewall rules can include sources in
VPC networks connected using VPC Network Peering. For
Dataflow jobs, that means a firewall rule can include sources
in both the worker VM network and peered VPC networks.
For more information about the differences between secure tags and network tags,
see
Comparison of Tags and network tags .
To apply secure tags to a Dataflow job, perform the following
steps:
Configure secure tags for your firewall policies. For more information, see
Configure secure tags .
Grant the Tag User role ( roles/resourcemanager.tagUser ) to the
Dataflow service account
on the resource (tag values). For more information about the necessary
permissions, see
Manage tags on resources .
When you create the Dataflow job, use the use_vm_tags
service option
with the following format:
Java
--dataflowServiceOptions=use_vm_tags=tagKeys/ KEY1 :tagValues/ VALUE1 ;tagKeys/ KEY2 :tagValues/ VALUE2
Python
--dataflow_service_options=use_vm_tags=tagKeys/ KEY1 :tagValues/ VALUE1 ;tagKeys/ KEY2 :tagValues/ VALUE2
Go
--dataflow_service_options=use_vm_tags=tagKeys/ KEY1 :tagValues/ VALUE1 ;tagKeys/ KEY2 :tagValues/ VALUE2
gcloud
Use the
gcloud dataflow jobs run command
with the additional-experiments option. If you're using Flex Templates, use
the
gcloud dataflow flex-template run
command.
--additional-experiments=use_vm_tags=tagKeys/ KEY1 :tagValues/ VALUE1 ;tagKeys/ KEY2 :tagValues/ VALUE2
Use network tags with Dataflow
Network tags are text attributes that you
can set on firewall rules and attach to Compute Engine VMs. Unlike
secure tags, network tags are text strings; they aren't a resource that is
managed by Resource Manager.
To apply network tags to a Dataflow job, use the
use_network_tags
experiment , as
follows:
Java
--dataflowServiceOptions=use_network_tags= TAG_NAME
Python
--dataflow_service_options=use_network_tags= TAG_NAME
Go
--dataflow_service_options=use_network_tags= TAG_NAME
gcloud
Use the
gcloud dataflow jobs run command
with the additional-experiments option. If you're using Flex Templates, use
the
gcloud dataflow flex-template run
command.
--additional-experiments=use_network_tags= TAG_NAME
Specifying the network tag also adds the default network tag
Dataflow to Flex template launcher VMs.
Replace TAG_NAME with the names of your tags. If you add
more than one tag, separate each tag with a semicolon ( ; ), as follows:
TAG_NAME_1 ; TAG_NAME_2 ; TAG_NAME_3 ;... .
After a job starts, you cannot add more network tags to the job.
Dataflow always adds the default network tag dataflow to every
worker VM it creates.
See the limits that apply to
network tags.
Firewall rules for Dataflow
Firewall rules let you allow or deny traffic to and from your VMs. If your
Dataflow jobs use
Dataflow Shuffle or
Streaming Engine , then you only need to
ensure that firewall rules allow access to Google Cloud APIs.
Otherwise, you must configure additional firewalls rules so that
Dataflow VMs can send and receive network traffic on TCP port
12345 for streaming jobs and on TCP port 12346 for batch jobs.
A project owner, editor, or security administrator
must create necessary firewall rules in the VPC network used by
your Dataflow VMs.
Before you configure firewall rules for Dataflow,
read the following documents:
VPC firewall rules overview and
Use VPC firewall rules
Hierarchical firewall policies overview and
Use Hierarchical firewall policies and rules
When you create firewall rules for Dataflow, specify the
Dataflow network tags. Otherwise, the firewall rules apply to all VMs
in the VPC network.
Where applicable, Hierarchical firewall policies are evaluated first and these rules preempt VPC
firewall rules. If the Dataflow job is in a project which is part of a folder or
organization where Hierarchical firewall policies are used, the
compute.orgFirewallPolicyAdmin role is required to make policy modifications.
If you don't create custom network tags when you run the pipeline code,
Dataflow VMs use the default dataflow tag. In the absence of custom network
tags, create the firewall rules with the default dataflow tag.
If you create custom network tags when you run the pipeline code,
Dataflow VMs use those tags. Create the firewall rules with the custom tags.
Some VPC networks, such as the automatically created default
network, include a default-allow-internal rule that meets the firewall
requirement for Dataflow.
Example firewall ingress rule
The ingress firewall rule permits Dataflow VMs to receive packets
from each other. You must always create ingress allow firewall rules or traffic
is always blocked, even if egress rules allow such traffic.
In the following example, a firewall ingress rule is created for
Dataflow, where all worker VMs have the default network tag dataflow . A project owner, editor, or security admin can use the following
gcloud command to create an ingress allow rule that permits traffic on TCP
ports 12345 and 12346 from VMs with the network tag dataflow to other VMs with
the same tag:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create FIREWALL_RULE_NAME_INGRESS \
--action = allow \
--direction = ingress \
--network = NETWORK \
--target-tags = CUSTOM_TAG \
--source-tags = CUSTOM_TAG \
--priority = PRIORITY_NUM \
--rules tcp:12345-12346
Replace the following:
FIREWALL_RULE_NAME_INGRESS : a name for the firewall rule
NETWORK : the name of the network that your worker
VMs use
CUSTOM_TAG : a comma-delimited list of network tags
The following is a list of guidelines for using network tags:
If you omit --target-tags , the rule applies to all VMs in the VPC network.
If you omit --source-tags and all other source specifications, traffic
from any source is allowed.
If you have not specified custom network tags and you want the rule to be specific to Dataflow VMs, use dataflow as the network tag.
If you have specified custom network tags and you want the rule to be
specific to Dataflow VMs, use your custom network tags.
PRIORITY_NUM : the priority of the firewall rule
Lower numbers have higher priorities, and 0 is the highest priority.
Example firewall egress rule
The egress firewall rule permits Dataflow VMs to send packets to each other. If
you've created any egress deny firewall rules, you might need to create custom
egress allow firewall rules in your VPC network.
In this example, a firewall egress rule is created for Dataflow,
where all worker VMs have the default network tag of dataflow . A project
owner, editor, or security administrator can use the following gcloud command to
create an egress allow rule that permits traffic from TCP ports 12345 and 12346
on VMs with the network tag dataflow to other VMs with the same tag:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create FIREWALL_RULE_NAME_EGRESS \
--network = NETWORK \
--action = allow \
--direction = egress \
--target-tags = CUSTOM_TAG \
--source-tags = CUSTOM_TAG \
--destination-ranges = DESTINATION-RANGES \
--priority = PRIORITY_NUM \
--rules tcp:12345-12346
Replace the following:
FIREWALL_RULE_NAME_EGRESS : a name for the firewall rule
NETWORK : the name of the network that your worker
VMs use
CUSTOM_TAG : a comma-delimited list of network tags
The following is a list of guidelines for using network tags:
If you omit --target-tags , the rule applies to all VMs in the VPC network.
If you omit --source-tags and all other source specifications, traffic
from any source is allowed.
If you have not specified custom network tags and you want the rule to be specific to Dataflow VMs, use dataflow as the network tag.
If you have specified custom network tags and you want the rule to be
specific to Dataflow VMs, use your custom network tags.
DESTINATION-RANGES : a comma-delimited list of CIDRs
Include the selected subnetwork's primary IP address range.
PRIORITY_NUM : the priority of the firewall rule
Lower numbers have higher priorities, and 0 is the highest priority.
For specific TCP ports used by Dataflow, you can
view the project container manifest .
The container manifest explicitly specifies the ports in order to map host ports
into the container.
SSH access to worker VMs
Dataflow does not require SSH; however, SSH is useful for
troubleshooting.
If your worker VM has an external IP address, you can
connect to the VM through either
the Google Cloud console or by using the Google Cloud CLI. To connect
by using SSH, you must have a firewall rule that allows incoming connections on TCP
port 22 from at least the IP address of the system on which you're running
gcloud or the system running the web browser that you use to access the
Google Cloud console.
You can view network configuration and activity by
opening an
SSH session on one of your workers
and running iproute2 . For more information, see the
iproute2 page in the
Linux Foundation wiki.
If you need to connect to a worker VM that only has an internal IP address, see
Choose a connection option for internal-only VMs .
