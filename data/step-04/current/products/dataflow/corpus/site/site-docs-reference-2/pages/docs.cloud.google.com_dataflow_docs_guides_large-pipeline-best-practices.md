Best practices for large batch pipelines
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document explains how to minimize the impact of job failures for large
batch pipelines. Large workload failures are particularly impactful because of
the time and money required to recover from and fix these failures. Retrying
these pipelines from scratch when they fail is expensive in terms of both time
and money.
To reduce expensive batch pipeline failures, follow the guidelines in this page.
Because you can't always completely avoid failed elements and pipeline failures,
the techniques provided focus on increasing resiliency, reducing the cost of
failures, and making it easier to debug and understand failures when they occur.
For general pipeline best practices, see Dataflow pipeline best
practices .
Run small experiments for large jobs
Before you run a large batch job, run one or more smaller jobs on a subset of
the dataset. This technique can both provide a cost estimate and help find
potential points of failure.
Cost estimate
Running experiments can provide an estimated floor of the total cost of running
the job. Typically, the calculation for the job cost is cost of test
job*size(full dataset)/size(test dataset) . Depending on the pipeline, the cost
can scale superlinearly or, less often, sublinearly. Nevertheless, this step
often provides a good rough estimate of the job cost. You can also try different
sizes of inputs to get a better estimate of how your costs scale. Use this
information to decide whether to proceed with the existing pipeline or to
rearchitect your pipeline to reduce costs.
Find points of failure
Running experiments can expose bugs, potential points of failure, or potential
configuration and efficiency issues. You can also examine other pipeline
metrics, such as the following metrics:
If your pipeline uses almost all of the available memory, it might
experience out-of-memory (OOM) exceptions under higher load or with
exceptionally large records. You might need to provision more memory for
your final job to avoid these OOM errors.
If your pipeline experiences dips in throughput, examine your pipeline logs
to determine why. You might find a stuck element or a part of your dataset
with particularly poor performance. You can process these data points
separately, or you can enforce a timeout when processing elements. For more
information, see the Time out expensive records section in
this document.
If your pipeline performs much worse on a task on Dataflow
than it does locally, examine your pipeline logic to figure out why. For
example, if you're getting the same throughput with eight cores on
Dataflow as you are with one core locally, the job might be
bottlenecked on contention for a resource. If you find that your performance
is worse than expected, consider one or more of the following options:
Run more experiments with different machine or software configurations.
Test locally with multiple cores at the same time.
Inspect your code to find potential bottlenecks when deploying at scale.
If your pipeline has any Dataflow recommendations, follow them to
improve performance.
Use dead-letter queues to handle unexpected bad data
Pipelines often succeed on most input elements but fail on a small subset of the
input. You might not catch this problem when you run small
experiments , because these experiments only test a subset
of the input. By default, Dataflow retries these failed
tasks
four times in batch mode and an unlimited number of times in streaming mode. In
batch mode, after reaching the retry limit, your entire job fails. In streaming
mode, it can stall indefinitely.
In many jobs, you can exclude these failing elements from the pipeline and
complete the rest of the job by using a dead-letter queue (unprocessed messages
queue). The dead-letter queue passes failed records to a separate output
PCollection , which you can manage separately from your main output. This
configuration lets you design a policy for these records. For example, you can
write them to Pub/Sub manually, inspect and clean them, and then
reprocess the records.
Many Apache Beam transforms include built-in support for dead-letter queues.
In Java, you can access them with an ErrorHandler
object. In Python, you can access them by using the with_exception_handling
method. Some transforms have custom ways of defining dead-letter queues, which
you can read about in the documentation for the transform. For more information,
see Use dead-letter queues for error
handling .
To determine whether your job meets the criteria for a dead-letter queue, see
the Limitations section in this document.
Dead-letter queue limitations
In the following scenarios, a dead-letter queue might not be helpful:
Full worker or DoFn lifecycle failures. If
processing fails for the whole worker or bundle, a dead-letter queue can't
catch the failure. For example, if your pipeline encounters an out-of-memory
(OOM) exception, all active tasks on the VM are failed and retried, without
sending anything to the dead-letter queue.
Combines or other aggregations. If your pipeline performs
computations that require all input elements to be present and processed as
part of the result, use caution when using a dead-letter queue before this
step. Using a dead-letter queue excludes part of your input data from the
result. Adding a dead-letter queue might trade correctness for fault
tolerance.
Failures on the dead-letter queue path. If an element fails
while being sent to the dead-letter queue sink, the whole pipeline can fail.
To avoid this failure, keep your dead-letter queue logic as basic as
possible. You can add a wait step (see the wait
class )
to ensure that your main input finishes before writing your dead-letter
queue elements. This configuration might reduce performance and delay error
signals from your pipeline.
Partially transformed elements. If you insert a dead-letter
queue part of the way through your pipeline, the dead-letter queue might
output the partially transformed element and not have access to the original
element. As a result, you can't clean the element and rerun the pipeline
against it. Instead, you might need to apply different logic to correlate
the output in the dead-letter queue to the original element, or you might
need to interpret and process the partially transformed element. It might
also result in inconsistent results. For example, if elements are sent down
two branches of a pipeline, and each branch sends exception-causing elements
to a dead-letter queue, a single input element might make it down one, the
other, both, or neither of the branches.
Time out expensive records
Pipelines might stop responding while processing a small subset of elements that
are more expensive or that hit a limitation that causes unresponsiveness, like a
deadlock. To mitigate this issue, some transforms let you set a timeout and fail
the timed-out elements in any user-code DoFn s that encounter this issue. For
example, you can use Python's with_exception_handling method. When you use
timeouts with a dead-letter queue, your pipeline can continue processing healthy
elements and make progress, and you can reprocess the expensive elements
separately. This configuration can incur a performance cost.
To determine which DoFn operations are likely to require a timeout, run small
experiments before launching your full pipeline.
Enable Vertical Autoscaling
If you are unsure how much memory your job needs or think that your job is at
risk of running out of memory, enable Vertical Autoscaling. This feature helps
avoid OOM failures when pipelines run at larger scale or when they encounter
exceptionally large elements.
Because Vertical Autoscaling might increase the cost of your job and doesn't
prevent all out-of-memory failures, you still need to address excessive memory
consumption issues. Vertical Autoscaling also requires Dataflow Prime,
which has additional
limitations
and a different billing model .
Use speculative execution to avoid stragglers
For batch pipelines, you can enable speculative execution , a feature to
mitigate the impact of slow-running or stuck tasks. These slow or stuck tasks
are also known as stragglers . This feature launches redundant, or backup,
executions of tasks that are taking too long. The first task to finish is used,
and the other is cancelled, which can improve the overall completion time of
your pipeline.
Speculative execution can help pipelines complete faster by
providing an alternative execution path for work items that are experiencing
delays due to slow worker machines or other transient issues such as
nondeterministic bugs, resource throttling, or connectivity issues.
Limitations and considerations
Before enabling speculative execution, consider the following:
Streaming pipelines: Speculative execution is not supported for
streaming pipelines.
Potential change in cost : The cost impact of this feature is difficult
to estimate because stragglers and the provisioning of backup tasks are hard
to predict. For example, while a backup work item consumes additional
resources, potentially increasing cost, its earlier completion can conversely
lead to resource savings and cost reduction. In either scenario, the overall
impact is expected to be minimal.
Consistent long-running work items : Speculative execution might not
significantly help with consistently long-running work items such as
hot-keys, as the underlying issue causing the slowness would still persist.
For more information about stragglers in batch jobs, see Troubleshoot
stragglers in batch jobs .
Enable speculative execution
To enable speculative execution, use the map_task_backup_mode Dataflow
service option. There are two modes available:
Java
--dataflowServiceOptions= map_task_backup_mode=ON
--dataflowServiceOptions= map_task_backup_mode=CAUTIOUS
Python / Go
--dataflow_service_options= map_task_backup_mode=ON
--dataflow_service_options= map_task_backup_mode=CAUTIOUS
In ON mode, a backup task is scheduled if the original task's expected runtime
is about 20% longer than a new task's expected runtime.
In CAUTIOUS mode, a backup task is scheduled if the original task's expected
runtime is about 70% longer than a new task's expected runtime.
To confirm speculative execution is enabled, check the log
messages . Look for entries that
show backup tasks were launched. This confirms that speculative execution is
triggered. To see these logs, go to the Job Logs panel for your pipeline
( Jobs > choose your
job > Logs
section > Job logs ). The log
message appears as follows:
Backup issued in step STEP_NAME . ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION .
Workarounds for failure-prone pipelines
Some pipelines are particularly error prone. While it is better to address the
source of these errors, to reduce the cost of failures consider the following
options.
Materialize intermediate results
Pipelines might have one or more particularly expensive transforms that dominate
pipeline execution time. Pipeline failures after this transform can be
particularly harmful, because all of the work already completed is lost. To
avoid this scenario, consider writing intermediate PCollections generated by
expensive steps into a sink like Cloud Storage. This configuration reduces
the cost of a failure. You need to weigh this advantage against the cost of
performing the extra write. You can use this materialized result in one of the
following ways:
Split your original pipeline into two pipelines: one that writes the
intermediate result and one that reads it.
Only on pipeline failure, read and flatten results from both your original
source and your materialized intermediate collection.
To ensure that these materializations are written before further processing, add
a wait step (see the wait
class )
before any subsequent processing steps.
