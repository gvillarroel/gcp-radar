Spanner change streams to BigQuery template
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Spanner change streams to BigQuery template is a streaming pipeline
that streams Spanner data change records and writes them into BigQuery tables
using Dataflow Runner V2.
Note: The Spanner change streams connector doesn't support draining a job. To
stop the pipeline, cancel the job
instead of draining it. Draining a job with
the Spanner change streams connector can cause it to become stuck in a
draining state. For more information, see
Draining in the Spanner documentation.
Columns not watched aren't included
in the BigQuery row. Any Spanner changes less than the Dataflow
watermark are either successfully applied to the BigQuery tables or are stored in the
dead-letter queue for retry. BigQuery rows are inserted out of order compared to the
original Spanner commit timestamp ordering.
If the necessary BigQuery tables don't exist, the pipeline creates them. Otherwise,
existing BigQuery tables are used. The schema of existing BigQuery tables must
contain the corresponding tracked columns of the Spanner tables and any additional
metadata columns that aren't ignored explicitly by the ignoreFields option.
See the description of the metadata fields in the following list.
Each new BigQuery row includes all columns
watched by the change stream from its corresponding row in your Spanner table at the
timestamp of the change record.
The following metadata fields are added to BigQuery tables. For
more details about these fields, see
Data change records
in "Change streams partitions, records, and queries."
_metadata_spanner_mod_type : The modification type (insert,
update, or delete) of the Spanner transaction. Extracted from change
stream data change record.
_metadata_spanner_table_name : The Spanner table name. This
field is not the metadata table name of the connector.
_metadata_spanner_commit_timestamp : The Spanner
commit timestamp , which is the time when
a change is committed. This value is extracted from the change stream data change record.
_metadata_spanner_server_transaction_id : A globally unique string that
represents the Spanner transaction
in which the change was committed. Only use this
value in the context of processing change stream records. It isn't
correlated with the transaction ID in Spanner's API. This value
is extracted from the change stream data change record.
_metadata_spanner_record_sequence : The sequence number for the record within
the Spanner transaction. Sequence numbers are guaranteed to be
unique and monotonically increasing, but not necessarily contiguous, within a
transaction. This value is extracted from the change stream data change record.
_metadata_spanner_is_last_record_in_transaction_in_partition : Indicates
whether the record is the last record for a Spanner transaction
in the current partition. This value is extracted from the change stream data change record.
_metadata_spanner_number_of_records_in_transaction : The number of data
change records that are part of the Spanner transaction across
all change stream partitions. This value is extracted from the change stream data change record.
_metadata_spanner_number_of_partitions_in_transaction : The number of
partitions that
return data change records for the Spanner
transaction. This value is extracted from the change stream data change record.
_metadata_big_query_commit_timestamp : The commit timestamp
when the row is inserted into BigQuery. If
useStorageWriteApi is true , this column is not
automatically created in the changelog table by the pipeline. In that case,
you must manually add this column in the changelog table and set CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as its default value if needed.
When using this template, be aware of the following details:
You can use this template to propagate new columns on existing tables or
new tables from Spanner to BigQuery. For more information,
see Handle adding tracking tables or columns .
For OLD_AND_NEW_VALUES and NEW_VALUES value capture types, when the data change record
contains an UPDATE change, the template needs to do a stale read to Spanner at the
commit timestamp of the data change record to retrieve the unchanged but watched columns. Make
sure to configure your database 'version_retention_period' properly for the stale read. For
the NEW_ROW value capture type, the template is more efficient, because the data change record captures
the full new row including columns that are not updated in UPDATE requests, and the template doesn't
need to do a stale read.
To minimize network latency and network transport costs, run the Dataflow
job from the same region as your Spanner instance or BigQuery tables. If you
use sources, sinks, staging file locations, or temporary file locations that are located outside
of your job's region, your data might be sent across regions. For more information, see
Dataflow regions .
This template supports all valid Spanner data types. If the BigQuery
type is more precise than the Spanner type, precision loss might occur during the
transformation. Specifically:
For Spanner JSON type, the order of the members of an object is
lexicographically ordered, but there is no such guarantee for BigQuery JSON type.
Spanner supports nanoseconds TIMESTAMP type, but BigQuery only supports
microseconds TIMESTAMP type.

Pipeline requirements
The Spanner instance must exist prior to running the pipeline.
The Spanner database must exist prior to running the pipeline.
The Spanner metadata instance must exist prior to running the pipeline.
The Spanner metadata database must exist prior to running the pipeline.
The Spanner change stream must exist prior to running the pipeline.
Only change streams that watch tables under the default schema are supported.
Change streams that watch tables under other schemas throw a [table not found error](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/issues/2622).
The BigQuery dataset must exist prior to running the pipeline.
Handle adding tracking tables or columns
This section describes best practices for handling adding tracking Spanner
tables and columns while the pipeline is running. The oldest supported template
version for this feature is 2024-09-19-00_RC00 .
Before you add a new column to a Spanner change stream scope,
first add the column to the BigQuery changelog table. The added
column must have a matching data type and be NULLABLE .
Wait at least 10 minutes before you continue to create the new column or
table in Spanner. Writing into the new column without waiting might
result in an unprocessed record with an
invalid error code in your dead-letter queue.
For NEW_ROW or NEW_ROW_AND_OLD_VALUES value
capture types, adding a new column with a default value during a
running pipeline is supported by first adding the column to the
BigQuery table and then adding it to the Spanner table.
For NEW_VALUES or OLD_AND_NEW_VALUES ,
adding a new column with a default value to a running pipeline might result
in data loss. To avoid data loss, you must perform a manual export and
import of your data using the following process:
Stop the Dataflow pipeline.
Add the column to the BigQuery table.
Add the column with a default value in Spanner.
Wait for the Spanner schema change and backfill to complete.
Export the Spanner table data at a timestamp after the
backfill is complete.
Import the data into the BigQuery table, ensuring you handle
the new column correctly.
Start the Dataflow pipeline from the same timestamp used for
the export.
Note: When you add a new column with a default
value to an existing Spanner table, Spanner performs a
backfill operation to populate all existing rows with this default value.
This operation can take time depending on the size of your table. You can
monitor the progress of the schema change, including the backfill, by
querying the information_schema.COLUMNS
view in Spanner. The backfill is complete when the
SPANNER_STATE of the new column is COMMITTED .
To add a new table, first add the table in the Spanner database.
The table is automatically created in BigQuery when the pipeline
receives a record for the new table.
After you add the new columns or tables in the Spanner database,
make sure to
alter your
change stream to track the new columns or tables that you want if they
aren't tracked implicitly already.
The template doesn't drop tables or columns from BigQuery. If a
column is dropped from the Spanner table, then null values are
populated to the BigQuery changelog columns for records generated
after the columns are dropped from the Spanner table, unless you
manually drop the column from BigQuery.
The template doesn't support column type updates. Although
Spanner supports changing a STRING column to a
BYTES column or a BYTES column to a
STRING column, you can't modify an existing column's data type
or use the same column name with different data types in BigQuery.
If you drop and recreate a column with the same name but a different type
in Spanner, the data might be written into the existing
BigQuery column, but the type is unchanged.
This template doesn't support column mode updates. Metadata columns
replicated into BigQuery are set to the REQUIRED mode.
All other columns replicated into BigQuery are set to
NULLABLE , regardless of whether they are defined as
NOT NULL in the Spanner table. You can't update the
NULLABLE columns to the REQUIRED mode in
BigQuery.
Changing a change stream's
value capture type
is not supported for running pipelines.

Production considerations
When running the Spanner Change Streams to BigQuery template in a production environment, consider the following best practices to help ensure reliability and prevent data loss:
Worker provisioning and scaling
Set maxNumWorkers adequately: Insufficient Dataflow workers can cause the pipeline to fall behind in processing change stream data. This can lead to increased latency and, in some scenarios, potential data loss due to internal connector timeouts and race conditions. The maximum number of workers must be sufficient to handle your peak Spanner write throughput.
Sizing guidance: While the optimal number varies with workload, consult the Spanner change streams guide on Sizing your Dataflow cluster . Monitor your pipeline's performance and adjust as needed. For example, some high-throughput workloads might require increasing maxNumWorkers significantly (for example, from 20 to 100 or more).
Autoscaling tuning: Dataflow 's default horizontal autoscaling is primarily CPU-driven. If your pipeline lags but CPU utilization isn't high, consider tuning autoscaling. Lowering the worker_utilization_hint parameter can make autoscaling more responsive to other bottlenecks. See Tune horizontal autoscaling for details.
Monitoring and alerting
Output Data Freshness (System Lag): This is the most critical metric to monitor for this template. A consistently increasing "Output Data Freshness" ( dataflow.googleapis.com/job/system_lag ) indicates the pipeline is not keeping up with incoming changes from Spanner .
Configure Alerts: Set up Cloud Monitoring alerts on the "Output Data Freshness" metric. Establish a baseline for your pipeline and configure thresholds based on your business requirements for data latency. Promptly investigate any alerts for sustained increases in this metric. For more information, see Dataflow job metrics .
Interpreting logs
SpannerException: DEADLINE_EXCEEDED : While the connector has retries, frequent com.google.cloud.spanner.SpannerException: DEADLINE_EXCEEDED messages in the Dataflow worker logs are a strong indicator that the workers are struggling to read data from Spanner change streams in a timely manner. This often signals that the pipeline is under-provisioned in terms of worker resources.
Spanner change stream configuration
Retention Period: Ensure the retention_period for your Spanner change stream is set to a duration sufficient to handle potential Dataflow pipeline slowdowns or outages. The default is 1 day. Consider increasing this to 3-7 days to provide a larger buffer for the pipeline to recover and process any backlog without data loss due to changes expiring from the stream.
By implementing these practices, you can improve the resilience and performance of your Spanner Change Streams to BigQuery Dataflow pipeline.
