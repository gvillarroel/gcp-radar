Feature
When you use min_ram or cpu_count resource hints for pipeline steps that don't require accelerators, Auto VM Selection (Instance Flexibility) is enabled automatically. With Auto VM Selection, workers are provisioned from a curated list of machine types that meet your RAM and CPU requirements. For more information, see Auto VM Selection for worker machine types .
February 27, 2026
Feature
Dataflow support for the C4A machine
series of Arm processors is
now generally available. Arm-based VMs are optimized for power efficiency and
can provide improved price-performance for many workloads. For more information,
see Use Arm VMs on Dataflow .
February 02, 2026
Feature
Dataflow Managed I/O now supports rolling upgrades for streaming jobs. With this
feature, Dataflow upgrades your Managed I/O connectors in running pipelines as
new connector versions become available. For more information, see
Automatic upgrades .
January 20, 2026
Feature
Dataflow is available in the Bangkok ( asia-southeast3 ) region. Learn more
about Google Cloud locations .
January 13, 2026
Feature
Dataflow now serves a notice for when the Dataflow
Runner v2 container image of a streaming pipeline
will be upgraded. To use a new image and avoid the scheduled maintenance, launch
a replacement job before the upgrade. For more information, see
Runner v2 harness update .
November 21, 2025
Feature
Dataflow now supports speculative execution for batch pipelines. This feature mitigates the impact of slow-running tasks ( stragglers ) by launching a redundant execution of these tasks. The first task to finish is used, and the other is canceled, which can improve the overall completion time of your pipeline. This feature is generally available. For more information, see Use speculative execution to avoid stragglers .
September 24, 2025
Feature
For jobs that use GPUs, Dataflow now supports the flex-start provisioning model. This flex-start provisioning model can improve your ability to get access to constrained GPU resources for short-duration workloads. This feature is available in Preview and is for batch pipelines only. For more information, see Configure a provisioning model .
September 08, 2025
Feature
Dataflow now supports using secure tags to set firewall rules on worker VMs. For more information, see Use secure tags with Dataflow .
August 27, 2025
Feature
Dataflow supports TPUs, Google's custom-designed AI accelerators that are optimized for large-scale AI/ML workloads. This feature lets you accelerate inference workloads on frameworks like PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow. This feature is generally available with an allowlist. For more information, see Dataflow support for TPUs .
Feature
Dataflow supports specifically targeted reservations for pipelines using accelerators (GPUs or TPUs). This functionality is generally available with an allowlist. For more information, see Use Compute Engine reservations with Dataflow .
Change
Dataflow supports NVIDIA® H100 and NVIDIA® H100 Mega GPU types. For more information, see Dataflow support for GPUs .
August 26, 2025
Fixed
Dataflow Runner v2 fixes an issue that could cause data discrepancies when using splittable DoFns, particularly when processing large datasets as side inputs. This fix ensures that all data is accurately processed and transmitted within the pipeline. This improvement is available in recent Dataflow service releases, and is automatically enabled when using Dataflow Runner v2.
Note: After this fix, pipelines that previously experienced data loss due to this issue might consume more resources (such as CPU, memory, and processing time) because more data is being processed. This increase in resource usage is expected and reflects the correct behavior of the pipeline.
August 11, 2025
Feature
Dataflow now automatically detects performance bottlenecks in streaming jobs. You can see the cause of the bottleneck in the Step Info panel to help with troubleshooting.
For more information, see Troubleshoot bottlenecks .
June 26, 2025
Feature
Dataflow now supports an automated parallel update workflow for streaming jobs. This feature helps minimize disruption by launching a new replacement job that runs in parallel with the existing job. After a duration of time you specify, the old job is automatically drained.
For more information, see Run parallel pipelines .
June 09, 2025
Feature
Dataflow now supports right fitting for streaming jobs. Right fitting lets you specify resource requirements for an entire pipeline or for specific pipeline steps. Previously, right fitting was only supported for batch pipelines. For more information, see Streaming right fitting .

Feature
Cloud Dataflow is now able to use workers in zones in the europe-west6 region (Zürich, Switzerland).
March 06, 2019
Issue
Apache Beam SDK 2.10.0 depends on gcsio client library version 1.9.13, which has known issues:
Reading side inputs can result in sending a large number of requests to Cloud Storage. As a result, Cloud Dataflow jobs can fail with HTTP 429 errors from Cloud Storage.
Apache Beam ParquetIO fails when reading files from Cloud Storage.
To work around these issues, either upgrade to Apache Beam SDK 2.11.0, or override the gcsio client library version to 1.9.16 or later.
February 25, 2019
Feature
You can now view system latency and data freshness metrics for your pipeline in the Cloud Dataflow monitoring interface.
February 20, 2019
Fixed
2018-2019-Apache Beam SDK 2.10.0 contains fixes for the known issues disclosed on December 20 and February 4.
February 04, 2019
Issue
In a specific case, users of Apache Beam Java SDKs (2.9.0 and earlier) and Cloud Dataflow Java SDKs (2.5.0 and earlier) might experience data duplication when reading files from Cloud Storage. Duplication might occur when all of the following conditions are true:
You are reading files with the content-encoding set to gzip, and the files are dynamically decompressive transcoded by Cloud Storage.
The file size (decompressed) is larger than 2.14 GB.
The input stream runs into an error (and is recreated) after 2.14 GB is read.
As a workaround, do not set the content-encoding header, and store compressed files in Cloud Storage with the proper extension (for example, gz for gzip). For existing files, you can update the content-encoding header and file name with the gsutil tool .
December 20, 2018
Issue
Streaming Engine users should not upgrade to SDK 2.9.0 due to a known issue. If you choose to use SDK 2.9.0, you must also set the enable_conscrypt_security_provider experimental flag to enable conscrypt, which has known stability issues.
December 17, 2018
Change
2019-The following decommission notice has been changed. For more information, see the release note for March 24 .

Shortly after this date, you will no longer be able to submit new Cloud Dataflow jobs or update running Cloud Dataflow jobs that use the decommissioned SDKs. In addition, existing streaming jobs that use these SDK versions might fail.
Apache Beam SDK for Java, versions 2.0.0 to 2.4.0 (inclusive)
Apache Beam SDK for Python, versions 2.0.0 to 2.4.0 (inclusive)
Cloud Dataflow SDK for Java, versions 2.0.0 to 2.4.0 (inclusive)
