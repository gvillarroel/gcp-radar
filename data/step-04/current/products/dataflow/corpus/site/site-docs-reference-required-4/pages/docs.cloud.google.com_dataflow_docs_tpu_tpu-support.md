Note: The Dataflow TPU offering is generally available with an
allowlist. To get access to this feature, reach out to your account team.
Google Cloud TPUs are custom-designed AI accelerators created by Google that are
optimized for training and using of large AI models. They are designed to
scale cost-efficiently for a wide range of AI workloads and provide versatility
to accelerate inference workloads on AI frameworks, including PyTorch, JAX, and
TensorFlow. For more details about TPUs, see Introduction to
Google Cloud TPU .
Prerequisites for using TPUs in Dataflow
Your Google Cloud projects must be approved to use this GA offering.
Limitations
This offering is subject to the following limitations:
Only single-host TPU accelerators are supported : The
Dataflow TPU offering supports only single-host TPU
configurations where each Dataflow worker manages one or many
TPU devices that are not interconnected with TPUs managed by other workers.
Only homogenous TPU worker pools are supported : Features like
Dataflow right fitting and Dataflow Prime
don't support TPU workloads.
Pricing
Dataflow jobs that use TPUs are billed for worker TPU chip-hours
consumed and are not billed for worker CPU and memory. For more information, see
the Dataflow pricing page .
Availability
The following TPU accelerators and processing regions are available.
Supported TPU accelerators
The supported TPU accelerator combinations are identified by the tuple (TPU
type, TPU topology).
TPU type refers to the model of the TPU device.
TPU topology refers to the number and physical arrangement of the TPU
chips in a slice.
To configure the type and topology of TPUs for Dataflow workers,
use the worker_accelerator pipeline
option formatted as
type:TPU_TYPE;topology:TPU_TOPOLOGY .
The following TPU configurations are supported with Dataflow:
