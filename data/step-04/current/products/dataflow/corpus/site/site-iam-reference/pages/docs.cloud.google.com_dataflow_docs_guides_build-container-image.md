This document describes how to create a custom container image for
Dataflow jobs.
Requirements
A custom container image for Dataflow must meet the following
requirements:
The Apache Beam SDK and necessary dependencies are installed. We recommend
starting with a default Apache Beam SDK image. For more information, see
Select a base image in this document.
The /opt/apache/beam/boot script must run as the last step during container
startup. This script initializes the worker environment and starts the SDK
worker process. This script is the default ENTRYPOINT in the Apache Beam
SDK images. However, if you use a different base image, or if you override the
default ENTRYPOINT , then you must run the script explicitly. For more
information, see Modify the container entrypoint in this
document.
Your container image must support the architecture of the worker VMs for your
Dataflow job. If you plan to use the custom container on ARM
VMs, we recommend building a multi-architecture image. For more information,
see
Build a multi-architecture container image .
Before you begin
Verify that the version of the Apache Beam SDK installed supports
Runner v2 and your language version. For more
information, see
Install the Apache Beam SDK .
To test your container image locally, you must have Docker installed.
For more information, see
Get Docker .
Create an Artifact Registry repository.
Specify Docker image format. You must have at least
Artifact Registry Writer access
to the repository.
To create a new repository, run the
gcloud artifacts repositories create command :
gcloud artifacts repositories create REPOSITORY \
--repository-format = docker \
--location = REGION \
--async
Replace the following:
REPOSITORY : a name for your repository. Repository names must be
unique for each location in a project.
REGION : the region to
deploy your Dataflow job in. Select a Dataflow
region close to where you run
the commands. The value must be a valid region name. For more information
about regions and locations, see
Dataflow locations .
This example uses the --async flag. The command returns immediately, without
waiting for the operation to complete.
To configure Docker to authenticate requests for Artifact Registry, run the
gcloud auth configure-docker command :
gcloud auth configure-docker REGION -docker.pkg.dev
The command updates your Docker configuration. You can now connect with
Artifact Registry in your Google Cloud project to push images.
Select a base image
We recommend starting with an Apache Beam SDK image as the base container
image. These images are released as part of Apache Beam releases to
Docker Hub .
Use an Apache Beam base image
To use an Apache Beam SDK image as the base image, specify the container
image in the FROM instruction and then add your own customizations.
Java
This example uses Java 8 with the Apache Beam SDK version 2.72.0.
FROM apache/beam_java8_sdk:2.72.0
# Make your customizations here, for example:
ENV FOO=/bar
COPY path/to/myfile ./
The runtime version of the custom container must match the runtime that you will
use to start the pipeline. For example, if you will start the pipeline from a
local Java 11 environment, the FROM line must specify a Java 11 environment:
apache/beam_java11_sdk:... .
Python
This example uses Python 3.10 with the Apache Beam SDK version 2.72.0.
FROM apache/beam_python3.10_sdk:2.72.0
# Make your customizations here, for example:
ENV FOO=/bar
COPY path/to/myfile ./
The runtime version of the custom container must match the runtime that you will
use to start the pipeline. For example, if you will start the pipeline from a
local Python 3.10 environment, the FROM line must specify a Python 3.10 environment:
apache/beam_python3.10_sdk:... .
Go
This example uses Go with the Apache Beam SDK version 2.72.0.
FROM apache/beam_go_sdk:2.72.0
# Make your customizations here, for example:
ENV FOO=/bar
COPY path/to/myfile ./
Use a custom base image
If you want to use a different base image, or need to modify some aspect of the
default Apache Beam images (such as OS version or patches), use a
multistage build
process. Copy the necessary artifacts from a default Apache Beam base image.
Note: Apache Beam and Dataflow are routinely tested using
Debian -based images.
Alpine based images are not supported at this
time.
Set the ENTRYPOINT to run the /opt/apache/beam/boot script, which
initializes the worker environment and starts the SDK worker process. If you
don't set this entrypoint, the Dataflow workers don't start
properly.
The following example shows a Dockerfile that copies files from the
Apache Beam SDK:
Java
FROM openjdk:8
# Copy files from official SDK image, including script/dependencies.
COPY --from=apache/beam_java8_sdk:2.72.0 /opt/apache/beam /opt/apache/beam
# Set the entrypoint to Apache Beam SDK launcher.
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/apache/beam/boot"]
Python
FROM python:3.10-slim
# Install SDK.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir apache-beam[gcp]==2.72.0
# Verify that the image does not have conflicting dependencies.
RUN pip check
# Copy files from official SDK image, including script/dependencies.
COPY --from=apache/beam_python3.10_sdk:2.72.0 /opt/apache/beam /opt/apache/beam
# Set the entrypoint to Apache Beam SDK launcher.
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/apache/beam/boot"]
This example assumes necessary dependencies (in this case, Python 3.10 and pip )
have been installed on the existing base image. Installing the Apache Beam
SDK into the image ensures that the image has the necessary SDK dependencies
and reduces the worker startup time.
Important: The SDK version specified in
the RUN and COPY instructions must match the version used to launch the pipeline.
Go
FROM golang:latest
# Copy files from official SDK image, including script/dependencies.
COPY --from=apache/beam_go_sdk:2.72.0 /opt/apache/beam /opt/apache/beam
# Set the entrypoint to Apache Beam SDK launcher.
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/apache/beam/boot"]
Modify the container entrypoint
If your container runs a custom script during container startup, the script must
end with running /opt/apache/beam/boot . Arguments passed by
Dataflow during container startup must be passed to the default
boot script. The following example shows a custom startup script that calls the
default boot script:
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is my custom script"
# ...
# Pass command arguments to the default boot script.
/opt/apache/beam/boot " $@ "
In your Dockerfile, set the ENTRYPOINT to call your script:
Java
FROM apache/beam_java8_sdk:2.72.0
COPY script.sh path/to/my/script.sh
ENTRYPOINT [ "path/to/my/script.sh" ]
Python
FROM apache/beam_python3.10_sdk:2.72.0
COPY script.sh path/to/my/script.sh
ENTRYPOINT [ "path/to/my/script.sh" ]
Go
FROM apache/beam_go_sdk:2.72.0
COPY script.sh path/to/my/script.sh
ENTRYPOINT [ "path/to/my/script.sh" ]
Build and push the image
You can use Cloud Build or Docker to build your container image and push it
to an Artifact Registry repository.
Cloud Build
To build the file and push it to your Artifact Registry repository, run the
gcloud builds submit command :
gcloud builds submit --tag REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /dataflow/ IMAGE : TAG .
Docker
docker build . --tag REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /dataflow/ IMAGE : TAG
docker push REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /dataflow/ IMAGE : TAG
Replace the following:
REGION : the
region
to deploy your Dataflow job in. The value of the REGION
variable must be a valid region name.
PROJECT_ID : the project name or username.
REPOSITORY : the image repository name.
IMAGE : the image's name.
TAG : the image tag. Always specify a versioned
container SHA or tag. Don't use the :latest tag or a mutable tag.
Pre-install Python dependencies
This section applies to Python pipelines.
When you launch a Python Dataflow job, you can specify additional
dependencies by using the --requirements_file or the --extra_packages option at
runtime. For more information, see
Managing Python Pipeline Dependencies .
Additional dependencies are installed in each Dataflow worker
container. When the job first starts and during autoscaling, the dependency
installation often leads to high CPU usage and a long warm-up period on all
newly started Dataflow workers.
To avoid repetitive dependency installations, you can pre-build a custom Python
SDK container image with the dependencies pre-installed. You can perform this
step at build time by using a Dockerfile, or at run time when you submit the
job.
Workers create a new virtual Python environment when they start the container.
For this reason, install dependencies into the default (global) Python
environment instead of creating a virtual environment. If you activate a
virtual environment in your container image, this environment might not be
activate when the job starts. For more information, see
Common issues .
Pre-install using a Dockerfile
To add extra dependencies directly to your Python custom container, use the
following commands:
FROM apache/beam_python3.10_sdk:2.72.0
COPY requirements.txt .
# Pre-install Python dependencies. For reproducibile builds,
# supply all of the dependencies and their versions in a requirements.txt file.
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# You can also install individual dependencies.
RUN pip install lxml
# Pre-install other dependencies.
RUN apt-get update \
&& apt-get dist-upgrade \
&& apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ffmpeg
Submit your job with the --sdk_container_image and the --sdk_location pipeline options.
The --sdk_location option prevents the SDK from downloading when your job launches.
The SDK is retrieved directly from the container image.
The following example runs the
wordcount example pipeline :
python -m apache_beam.examples.wordcount \
--input = INPUT_FILE \
--output = OUTPUT_FILE \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--region = REGION \
--temp_location = TEMP_LOCATION \
--runner = DataflowRunner \
--experiments = use_runner_v2 \
--sdk_container_image = IMAGE_URI
--sdk_location = container
Replace the following:
INPUT_FILE : an input file for the pipeline
OUTPUT_FILE : a path to write output to
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID
REGION : the
region to deploy
your Dataflow job in
TEMP_LOCATION : the Cloud Storage path for
Dataflow to stage temporary job files
IMAGE_URI : the custom container image URI
Pre-build a container image when submitting the job
Pre-building a container image lets you to pre-install the pipeline dependencies
before job startup. You don't need to build a custom container image.
To pre-build a container with additional Python dependencies when you submit a
job, use the following pipeline options:
--prebuild_sdk_container_engine=[cloud_build | local_docker] . When this flag
is set, Apache Beam generates a custom container and installs all of the
dependencies specified by the --requirements_file and the --extra_packages
options. This flag supports the following values:
cloud_build . Use Cloud Build to build the
container. The Cloud Build API must be enabled in your project.
local_docker . Use your local Docker installation to build the container.
--docker_registry_push_url= IMAGE_PATH .
Replace IMAGE_PATH with an Artifact Registry folder.
--sdk_location=container . This option prevents the workers from downloading
the SDK when your job launches. Instead, the SDK is retrieved directly from
the container image.
The following example uses Cloud Build to pre-build the image:
python -m apache_beam.examples.wordcount \
--input = INPUT_FILE \
--output = OUTPUT_FILE \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--region = REGION \
--temp_location = TEMP_LOCATION \
--runner = DataflowRunner \
--disk_size_gb = DISK_SIZE_GB \
--experiments = use_runner_v2 \
--requirements_file = ./requirements.txt \
--prebuild_sdk_container_engine = cloud_build \
--docker_registry_push_url = IMAGE_PATH \
--sdk_location = container
The pre-build feature requires the Apache Beam SDK for Python version
2.25.0 or later.
The SDK container image pre-building workflow uses the image passed using the
--sdk_container_image pipeline option as the base image. If the option is not
set, by default an Apache Beam image is used as the base image.
Note: With Apache Beam SDK versions 2.38.0 and earlier, to specify the base image,
use --prebuild_sdk_container_base_image .
You can reuse a prebuilt Python SDK container image in another job with the same dependencies and SDK version.
To reuse the image, pass the prebuilt container image URL to the other job
by using the --sdk_container_image pipeline option. Remove the dependency
options --requirements_file , --extra_packages , and --setup_file .
If you don't plan to reuse the image, delete it after the job completes.
You can delete the image with the gcloud CLI
or in the Artifact Registry pages in the Google Cloud console.
If the image is stored in Artifact Registry, use the
artifacts docker images delete command:
gcloud artifacts docker images delete IMAGE --delete-tags
Common issues
If your job has extra Python dependencies from a private PyPi mirror and can't be pulled
by a remote Cloud Build job, try using the local docker option or
try building your container using a Dockerfile.
If the Cloud Build job fails with docker exit code 137 , the build job ran out of memory,
potentially due to the size of the dependencies being installed. Use a larger Cloud Build
worker machine type by passing --cloud_build_machine_type= machine_type ,
where machine_type is one of the following options:
n1-highcpu-8
n1-highcpu-32
e2-highcpu-8
e2-highcpu-32
By default, Cloud Build uses the machine type e2-medium .
In Apache Beam 2.44.0 and later, workers create a virtual environment when
starting a custom container. If the container creates its own virtual
environment to install dependencies, those dependencies are discarded. This
behavior can cause errors such as the following:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '<dependency name>'
To avoid this issue, install dependencies into the default (global) Python
environment. As a workaround, disable this behavior in Beam 2.48.0 and
later by setting the following environment variable in your container image:
ENV RUN_PYTHON_SDK_IN_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=1
