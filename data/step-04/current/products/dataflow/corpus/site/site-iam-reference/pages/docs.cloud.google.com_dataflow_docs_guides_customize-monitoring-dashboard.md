Customize the Dataflow monitoring dashboard
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows how to customize the Dataflow
project monitoring dashboard , by
adding a graph that queries Cloud Monitoring metrics.
The project monitoring dashboard lets you monitor a collection of jobs and see
their overall health and performance. The dashboard contains a default set of
charts that are useful for most workloads. By customizing the dashboard, you can
add charts that are specific to your business requirements.
Example scenario
To show how you might customize the dashboard, assume that an organization wants
to track the estimated cost of the top 25 jobs in their project.
For this scenario, assume that the jobs have the following characteristics:
The jobs are all streaming jobs.
The jobs use the
data-processed billing model .
The jobs save files to
Persistent Disk , both Standard
(HDD) and SSD.
The jobs don't use GPUs.
Choose metrics
The following metrics are needed to estimate the cost of a job, given the
assumptions listed the previous section:
Resource Relevant metric
CPU (vCPU per hour)
job/total_vcpu_time
Memory (GB per hour)
job/total_memory_usage_time
Data processed during shuffle (GB)
job/total_streaming_data_processed
Persistent Disk usage (GB per hour, Standard and SSD)
job/total_pd_usage_time
For more information, see Dataflow pricing .
Important: The actual cost to run a job depends on factors such as
Dataflow pricing model,
committed use discounts (CUDs) , and contractual
discounts. Dataflow job metrics can give you a baseline for cost
optimization, but the actual costs might differ.
To learn which resources are available in Monitoring, see
Monitored resource types .
Write a PromQL query
To query metrics from Cloud Monitoring, use
Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) . This section shows how to write
a PromQL query for the scenario by building it up from smaller clauses.
This section doesn't assume any prior knowledge of PromQL. For more
information, see PromQL in Cloud Monitoring .
Map metric names to PromQL strings
To use Monitoring metrics in PromQL queries, you must map
the metric name to a PromQL string, as follows:
Metric name PromQL string
job/total_vcpu_time
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_vcpu_time
job/total_memory_usage_time
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_memory_usage_time
job/total_streaming_data_processed
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_streaming_data_processed
job/total_pd_usage_time
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_pd_usage_time
For more information, see
Mapping Cloud Monitoring metrics to PromQL .
Build the query
To get the estimated cost, calculate the prices for each component based on
the most current value of each metric. The metrics are sampled every 60 seconds,
so to get the latest value, use a 1-minute windowing function and take the
maximum value within each window.
To get the estimated CPU cost, first convert job/total_vcpu_time from
seconds to hours. Multiply by CPU price per vCPU per hour.
# ((vCPU time)[Bucket 1m] / Seconds per hour * vCPU Price)
max_over_time(dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_vcpu_time[1m]) / 3600 * CPU_PRICE
This formula gives the estimated CPU cost for all jobs in the project. To get
the estimated CPU cost per job, use the sum aggregation operator and group
by job ID.
sum(
max_over_time(dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_vcpu_time[1m]) / 3600 * CPU_PRICE
) by (job_id)
To get the estimated memory cost, convert job/total_memory_usage_time from
seconds to hours. Multiply by memory price per GB per hour and group by job
ID.
#((Memory time)[Bucket 1m] / Seconds per hour) * Memory Price
sum(
max_over_time(dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_memory_usage_time[1m]) / 3600 * MEMORY_PRICE
) by (job_id)
To get the estimated shuffle cost, convert
job/total_streaming_data_processed from bytes to GB. Multiply by the price
of data processed during shuffle per GB and group by job ID.
# Shuffle Billing. Reported once every 60 seconds, measured in bytes.
# Formula: (Shuffle Data)[Bucket 1m] / (Bytes in GB) * (Shuffle Price)
sum(
max_over_time(
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_streaming_data_processed[1m]
) / 1000000000 * SHUFFLE_PRICE
) by (job_id)
To get the estimated Persistent Disk usage cost, indexing on the
storage_type label to separate by disk type (Standard or SSD). Convert each
value from GB-seconds to GB-hours and group by job ID.
# Formula: ((Standard PD time)[Bucket 1m] / Seconds per hour) * Standard PD price
sum(
max_over_time(
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_pd_usage_time{storage_type="HDD"}[1m]
) / 3600 * STANDARD_PD_PRICE
) by (job_id)
# Formula: ((SSD PD time)[Bucket 1m] / Seconds per hour) * SSD PD price
sum(
max_over_time(
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_pd_usage_time{storage_type="SSD"}[1m]
) / 3600 * SSD_PD_PRICE
) by (job_id)
Summing the previous values gives the estimated cost per job. To get the top
25 jobs, use a top K filter:
topk(25,
# Sum the individual values.
)
Write the complete query
The following shows the complete query:
topk(25,
sum(
max_over_time(
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_vcpu_time[1m]) / 3600 * CPU_PRICE
)
by (job_id) +
sum(
max_over_time(
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_memory_usage_time[1m]) / 3600 * MEMORY_PRICE
)
by (job_id) +
sum(
max_over_time(
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_streaming_data_processed[1m]) / 1000000000 * SHUFFLE_PRICE
)
by (job_id) +
sum(
max_over_time(
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_pd_usage_time{storage_type="HDD"}[1m]) / 3600 * STANDARD_PD_PRICE
)
by (job_id) +
sum(
max_over_time(
dataflow_googleapis_com:job_total_pd_usage_time{storage_type="SSD"}[1m]) / 3600 * SSD_PD_PRICE
)
by (job_id)
)
Replace the following variables with values from the
Dataflow pricing page for your region.
CPU_PRICE : CPU price, per vCPU per hour
MEMORY_PRICE : Memory price, per GB per hour
SHUFFLE_PRICE : Shuffle price, per GB
STANDARD_PD_PRICE : Standard Persistent Disk price, per GB per
hour
SSD_PD_PRICE : SSD Persistent Disk price, per GB per hour
