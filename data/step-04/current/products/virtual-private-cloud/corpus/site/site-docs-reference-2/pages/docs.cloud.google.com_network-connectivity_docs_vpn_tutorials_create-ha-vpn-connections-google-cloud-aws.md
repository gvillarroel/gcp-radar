Create HA VPN connections between Google Cloud and AWS
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial demonstrates how to create highly available VPN connections
between Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for direct
communication between VPC networks across the two cloud platforms.
This tutorial assumes that you're familiar with basic concepts of Virtual Private Cloud
(VPC) networks, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), virtual private
networks (VPNs), and IPsec tunnels.
Google Cloud provides a
highly available HA VPN
service to connect your VPC network to environments running outside of
Google Cloud, such as on-premises or on AWS through an IPsec VPN
connection. HA VPN provides an
SLA of 99.99% service availability
when configured based on Google best practices. For more
information, see Cloud VPN Service Level Agreement (SLA) .
Architecture overview
The architecture described on this page includes the following components:
Cloud Router : A fully distributed and managed Google Cloud
service to provide dynamic routing using BGP for your VPC
networks.
HA VPN gateway : A Google-managed VPN gateway running
on Google Cloud. Each HA VPN gateway is a regional
resource that has two interfaces, each with its own external IP addresses:
interface 0 and 1.
VPN tunnels : Connections from the HA VPN gateway to
the peer VPN gateway on AWS through which encrypted traffic passes.
Peer VPN gateway : Two
AWS site-to-site VPN endpoints, which can be from an AWS virtual private
gateway or AWS transit gateway. For more information, see
What is AWS Site-to-Site VPN?
Each of the peer VPN gateway connections comes with two tunnels that are
pre-configured to point to a single customer gateway, which in this case is a
Google Cloud HA VPN interface. With this
configuration, the minimum number of tunnels to meet the 99.99% service
availability SLA is four.
Routing options and combined bandwidth over the VPN tunnels vary based on the
Site-to-Site VPN option used on the AWS side:
Transit gateway : If you create the AWS transit gateway with no BGP
preference, ECMP equally distributes traffic across active tunnels.
To use the VPN connectivity across multiple Google Virtual Private Cloud networks,
use a connectivity VPC network to scale a hub-and-spoke architecture with multiple VPC networks .
For more information about AWS transit gateways, see
What is Amazon VPC Transit Gateways? .
Virtual private gateway : If you use an AWS virtual private gateway,
only one tunnel across all connections on the gateway is selected. To use
more than one tunnel, instead use an AWS transit gateway so that
equal-cost multipath (ECMP) is available.
For details about VPN route priority with AWS, see
Site-to-Site VPN routing options .
For more information about AWS virtual private gateways, see
Tunnel options for your Site-to-Site VPN connection .
The following diagram shows the architecture.

Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Compute Engine API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
Make sure that you have the
required administrative roles
to configure networking components:
Network Admin: compute.networkAdmin
Security Admin: compute.securityAdmin
Compute Admin: compute.admin
For more information about the purposes of these roles, see
IAM roles for networking-related job functions .
Create the HA VPN gateway and Cloud Router on Google Cloud
In this section, you create a VPC network, an HA VPN
gateway, and a Cloud Router on Google Cloud.
In Cloud Shell, make sure that you're working in the
Google Cloud project that you created or selected.
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
export PROJECT_ID = ` gcloud config list --format = "value(core.project)" `
Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your
Google Cloud project ID.
To create a custom VPC network with a single subnet, use the gcloud compute networks create command :
gcloud compute networks create NETWORK \
--subnet-mode SUBNET_MODE \
--bgp-routing-mode BGP_ROUTING_MODE
Replace the following:
NETWORK : The name of the network
SUBNET_MODE : The
subnet mode
BGP_ROUTING_MODE : The
BGP routing mode
For example, the following command creates a custom VPC network named gc-vpc
with a single subnet:
gcloud compute networks create gc-vpc \
--subnet-mode custom \
--bgp-routing-mode global
To create one subnet to host the test VMs, use the gcloud compute networks subnets create command :
gcloud compute networks subnets create SUBNET_NAME \
--network NETWORK \
--region SUBNET_REGION \
--range IP_ADDRESS_RANGE
Replace the following:
SUBNET_NAME : The subnet name
SUBNET_REGION : The region in which to create the subnet
IP_ADDRESS_RANGE : The
IP address range for the subnet
For example, the following command creates a subnet named subnet-east4 in
the VPC network gc-vpc .
gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-east4 \
--network gc-vpc \
--region us-east4 \
--range 10.1.1.0/24
To create a HA VPN gateway, use the gcloud compute vpn-gateways create command :
gcloud compute vpn-gateways create HA_VPN_GATEWAY_NAME \
--network NETWORK \
--region REGION
Replace HA_VPN_GATEWAY_NAME with the name for the
HA VPN gateway.
To create a Cloud Router, use the gcloud compute routers create command :
gcloud compute routers create ROUTER_NAME \
--region REGION \
--network NETWORK \
--asn GOOGLE_ASN \
--advertisement-mode custom \
--set-advertisement-groups all_subnets
Replace the following:
ROUTER_NAME : The name for your Cloud Router
GOOGLE_ASN : The private ASN (autonomous system
number) for the Cloud Router that you're creating. It can be any
private ASN in the range 64512-65534 or 4200000000-4294967294 that you
aren't already using as a peer ASN in the same region and network.
For example, the following command creates a Cloud Router named
cloud-router .
gcloud compute routers create cloud-router \
--region us-east4 \
--network gc-vpc \
--asn 65534 \
--advertisement-mode custom \
--set-advertisement-groups all_subnets
To create a VPN gateway with two interfaces, make a note of the external IP
addresses. You need these addresses when setting up your environment on
the AWS side.
Create gateways and VPN connections on AWS
In this section, you create customer gateways, a target gateway, and VPN
connections with dynamic routing.
You run AWS commands by using the AWS Command Line Interface .
To create two customer gateways by using the following AWS command, use the create-customer-gateway AWS CLI command :
aws ec2 create-customer-gateway --type ipsec.1 --public-ip INTERFACE_0_IP_ADDRESS --bgp-asn GOOGLE_ASN
aws ec2 create-customer-gateway --type ipsec.1 --public-ip INTERFACE_1_IP_ADDRESS --bgp-asn GOOGLE_ASN
Replace INTERFACE_0_IP_ADDRESS and
INTERFACE_1_IP_ADDRESS with the external IP addresses
from the final step in the previous section.
To create a target gateway and attach it to your Amazon VPC, do the
following:
The target gateway can be a virtual private gateway or a transit
gateway. For more information, see
Create a target gateway .
Virtual private gateway
Create a virtual private gateway with a specific AWS-side ASN by using the create-vpn-gateway AWS CLI command :
aws ec2 create-vpn-gateway --type ipsec.1 --amazon-side-asn AWS_SIDE_ASN
Replace AWS_SIDE_ASN with the ASN for the
AWS side.
This command should look similar to the following example:
aws ec2 create-vpn-gateway --type ipsec.1 --amazon-side-asn 65001
Attach the virtual private gateway to your VPC network by using the attach-vpn-gateway AWS CLI command :
aws ec2 attach-vpn-gateway --vpn-gateway-id VPN_GATEWAY_ID --vpc-id VPC_ID
Transit gateway
Create a transit gateway by using the create-transit-gateway AWS CLI command :
aws ec2 create-transit-gateway --description TRANSIT_GATEWAY_DESCRIPTION \
--options = AmazonSideAsn = 65001 ,AutoAcceptSharedAttachments = enable,DefaultRouteTableAssociation = enable,DefaultRouteTablePropagation = enable,VpnEcmpSupport = enable,DnsSupport = enable
Replace TRANSIT_GATEWAY_DESCRIPTION with a
description for your transit gateway.
Attach your VPC network to the transit gateway by using the create-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment AWS CLI command :
aws ec2 create-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment \
--transit-gateway-id TRANSIT_GATEWAY_ID \
--vpc-id VPC_ID \
--subnet-ids "SUBNET_ID"
Replace the following:
TRANSIT_GATEWAY_ID : The ID of the transit gateway
VPC_ID : The ID of the VPC
SUBNET_ID : The IDs of one or more subnets
To create a VPN connection with dynamic routing, do the following:
The method for creating a VPN connection with dynamic routing differs
depending on whether your target gateway is a virtual private gateway or a
transit gateway. For more information, see
Create a VPN connection .
Virtual private gateway
Create a VPN connection with dynamic routing between the virtual
private gateway and the customer gateways, and apply tags to the VPN
connection:
aws ec2 create-vpn-connection \
--type ipsec.1 \
--customer-gateway-id CUSTOMER_GATEWAY_1 \
--vpn-gateway-id VPN_GATEWAY_ID \
--options TunnelOptions = '[{TunnelInsideCidr= AWS_T1_IP ,PreSharedKey= SHARED_SECRET_1 },{TunnelInsideCidr= AWS_T2_IP ,PreSharedKey= SHARED_SECRET_2 }]'
aws ec2 create-vpn-connection \
--type ipsec.1 \
--customer-gateway-id CUSTOMER_GATEWAY_2 \
--vpn-gateway-id VPN_GATEWAY_ID \
--options TunnelOptions = '[{TunnelInsideCidr= AWS_T3_IP ,PreSharedKey= SHARED_SECRET_3 },{TunnelInsideCidr= AWS_T4_IP ,PreSharedKey= SHARED_SECRET_4 }]'
Replace the following:
CUSTOMER_GATEWAY_1 : Google Cloud VPN
gateway, interface 0
CUSTOMER_GATEWAY_2 : Google Cloud VPN
gateway, interface 1
AWS_T1_IP : Inside IP address for virtual
private gateway for connection 1, tunnel 1
AWS_T2_IP : Inside IP address for virtual
private gateway for connection 1, tunnel 2
AWS_T3_IP : Inside IP address for virtual
private gateway for connection 2, tunnel 1
AWS_T4_IP : Inside IP address for virtual
private gateway for connection 2, tunnel 2
SHARED_SECRET_1 : Pre-shared key for connection
1, tunnel 1
SHARED_SECRET_2 : Pre-shared key for connection
1, tunnel 2
SHARED_SECRET_3 : Pre-shared key for connection
2, tunnel 1
SHARED_SECRET_4 : Pre-shared key for connection
2, tunnel 2
Transit gateway
Create a VPN connection with dynamic routing between the transit
gateway and the customer gateways:
aws ec2 create-vpn-connection \
--type ipsec.1 \
--customer-gateway-id CUSTOMER_GATEWAY_1 \
--transit-gateway-id TRANSIT_GATEWAY_ID \
--options TunnelOptions = '[{TunnelInsideCidr= AWS_T1_IP ,PreSharedKey= SHARED_SECRET_1 },{TunnelInsideCidr= AWS_T2_IP ,PreSharedKey= SHARED_SECRET_2 }]'
aws ec2 create-vpn-connection \
--type ipsec.1 \
--customer-gateway-id CUSTOMER_GATEWAY_2 \
--transit-gateway-id TRANSIT_GATEWAY_ID \
--options TunnelOptions = '[{TunnelInsideCidr= AWS_T3_IP ,PreSharedKey= SHARED_SECRET_3 },{TunnelInsideCidr= AWS_T4_IP ,PreSharedKey= SHARED_SECRET_4 }]'
Replace the following:
CUSTOMER_GATEWAY_1 : Google Cloud VPN
gateway, interface 0
CUSTOMER_GATEWAY_2 : Google Cloud VPN
gateway, interface 1
TRANSIT_GATEWAY_ID : The ID of the transit
gateway associated with the VPN connection

SHARED_SECRET_3 : Pre-shared key for connection
2, tunnel 1
SHARED_SECRET_4 : Pre-shared key for connection

AWS reserves some CIDR ranges, so you can't use values in these
ranges as inside IP addresses ( AWS_T1_IP ,
AWS_T2_IP , AWS_T3_IP ,
AWS_T4_IP ). For information about what CIDR
blocks AWS reserves, see
Tunnel options for your Site-to-Site VPN connection .
You create four tunnels to Google Cloud by using these commands.
Download the configuration file
for the two VPN connections.
In the next steps, you use values from the configuration file that you
downloaded to create and configure resources on the Google Cloud
side.
Create VPN tunnels and Cloud Router interfaces on Google Cloud
In this section, you use the information from the AWS VPN connection that you
created in the previous section to create an external VPN gateway ,
VPN tunnels, and Cloud Router interfaces in Google Cloud.
When you configure Cloud VPN tunnels to AWS, you must use the IKEv2
protocol and select only one IKE cipher set to help ensure successful tunnel
establishment. For example, select one Phase 1 and one Phase 2 encryption
algorithm, integrity algorithm, and Diffie-Hellman (DH) group. The default AWS
transform sets create a large security association
(SA) payload, which can
cause IP fragmentation of IKE packets. Cloud VPN doesn't support
fragmented IKE packets.
In Cloud Shell, create an external VPN gateway
with four interfaces for the AWS outside IP addresses.
Before you create the external VPN gateway, verify that the AWS outside IP
addresses match the values in the configuration file that you downloaded.
You can't modify these IP addresses after you create the external VPN
gateway. If the addresses don't match, the HA VPN tunnel
connection can't be established.
gcloud compute external-vpn-gateways create PEER_GATEWAY_NAME --interfaces \
0 = AWS_GW_IP_1 ,1 = AWS_GW_IP_2 ,2 = AWS_GW_IP_3 ,3 = AWS_GW_IP_4
Caution: Before you create the HA VPN gateway, verify that the
AWS outside IP addresses ( OutsideIpAddress ) match the values in the
downloaded configuration file. You cannot change
these IP addresses later. If the addresses don't match, the VPN tunnel
connection won't be established.
Replace the following:
AWS_GW_IP_1 : Outside IP address for virtual
private gateway for connection 1, tunnel 1
AWS_GW_IP_2 : Outside IP address for virtual
private gateway for connection 1, tunnel 2
AWS_GW_IP_3 : Outside IP address for virtual
private gateway for connection 2, tunnel 1
AWS_GW_IP_4 : Outside IP address for virtual
private gateway for connection 2, tunnel 2
Create four VPN tunnels.
Tunnel 1:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create tunnel-1 \
--peer-external-gateway PEER_GATEWAY_NAME \
--peer-external-gateway-interface 0 \
--region REGION \
--ike-version 2 \

--peer-external-gateway PEER_GATEWAY_NAME \
--peer-external-gateway-interface 3 \
--region REGION \
--ike-version 2 \
--shared-secret SHARED_SECRET_4 \
--router ROUTER_NAME \
--vpn-gateway HA_VPN_GATEWAY_NAME \
--interface 1
Replace the following:
PEER_GATEWAY_NAME : a name of the external peer gateway
that you created in step 1
REGION : the Google Cloud region
where you create the tunnel
SHARED_SECRET : your pre-shared key (PSK),
which must correspond with the pre-shared key for the partner tunnel
that you create on your peer gateway; to generate a strong pre-shared key,
see Generate a strong pre-shared key
ROUTER_NAME : the name of the Cloud Router
gateway that you created in the Create the HA VPN gateway and Cloud Router on Google Cloud section.
HA_VPN_GATEWAY_NAME : the name of the HA VPN
gateway that you created in the Create the HA VPN gateway and Cloud Router on Google Cloud section.
Create four Cloud Router interfaces.
In the following commands, replace each GOOGLE_BGP_IP_TUNNEL placeholder
with the tunnel's inside IP address on the Google Cloud side. You can
find the values in the AWS VPN configuration files as the customer gateway
address for each tunnel. Each of these addresses must be in the /30 CIDR
range within the 169.254.0.0/16 network range.
Cloud Router interface 1:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name int-1 \
--vpn-tunnel tunnel-1 \
--ip-address GOOGLE_BGP_IP_TUNNEL_1 \
--mask-length 30 \
--region REGION
Cloud Router interface 2:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name int-2 \
--vpn-tunnel tunnel-2 \
--ip-address GOOGLE_BGP_IP_TUNNEL_2 \

--interface-name int-4 \
--vpn-tunnel tunnel-4 \
--ip-address GOOGLE_BGP_IP_TUNNEL_4 \
--mask-length 30 \
--region REGION
Add BGP peers.
In the following commands, replace PEER_ASN with the
ASN for the AWS side of the BGP session.
AWS connection 1, tunnel 1:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name aws-conn1-tunn1 \
--peer-asn PEER_ASN \
--interface int-1 \
--peer-ip-address AWS_T1_IP \
--region REGION
AWS connection 1, tunnel 2:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name aws-conn1-tunn2 \
--peer-asn PEER_ASN \
--interface int-2 \
--peer-ip-address AWS_T2_IP \
--region REGION
AWS connection 2, tunnel 1:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name aws-conn2-tunn1 \
--peer-asn PEER_ASN \
--interface int-3 \
--peer-ip-address AWS_T3_IP \

--peer-name aws-conn2-tunn2 \
--peer-asn PEER_ASN \
--interface int-4 \
--peer-ip-address AWS_T4_IP \
--region REGION
Verify the configuration
In Cloud Shell, verify the Cloud Router status:
gcloud compute routers get-status ROUTER_NAME \
--region REGION \
--format = 'flattened(result.bgpPeerStatus[].name, result.bgpPeerStatus[].ipAddress, result.bgpPeerStatus[].peerIpAddress)'
The output is similar to the following:

Test the VPN connection
Create test VMs on each side of the tunnels to test ping requests.
Make sure that you have VPC firewall rules
to allow ICMP traffic.
For instructions on how to create Compute Engine VMs, see
Create and start a Compute Engine instance .
For instructions on how to create EC2 instances on AWS, see
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance .
Test the connection by using the ping
command .
If the ping test fails, view the logs in Google Cloud and the
AWS Site-to-Site VPN
logs .
Error messages in the logs can help you to identify the issue. To learn
how to troubleshoot issues with your VPN connection, see the following
