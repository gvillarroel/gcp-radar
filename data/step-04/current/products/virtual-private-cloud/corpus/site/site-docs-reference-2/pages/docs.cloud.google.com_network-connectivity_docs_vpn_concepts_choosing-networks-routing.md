Supported networks
Cloud VPN supports custom mode VPC networks, auto mode
VPC networks , and legacy networks .
However, you should consider the following best practices:
Use VPC networks instead of legacy networks. Legacy
networks don't support subnets; the entire network uses a single range of IP
addresses. Legacy networks cannot be converted into VPC
networks.
Use a custom mode VPC network. VPC
networks in custom mode provide you with full control over the range of IP
addresses used by their subnets.
If you use Cloud VPN to connect two VPC networks,
at least one network must be a custom mode VPC network.
Auto mode VPC networks use the same range of internal IP
addresses for their subnets.
Review the considerations for auto mode
VPC networks
before using one with Cloud VPN. Auto mode VPC
networks automatically create a subnet in each Google Cloud region,
including automatically creating new subnets
in new regions as they are added. Avoid using the internal IP addresses
from the range used by auto mode VPC networks in
the network to which Cloud VPN tunnels connect.
Routing options for VPN tunnels
Classic VPN supports static routing options for VPN
tunnels, while HA VPN supports the dynamic routing option.
You can use Classic VPN tunnels that use dynamic routing
only if the Classic VPN gateway connects to VPN gateway
software running inside a Compute Engine VM.
Dynamic routing uses the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) .
Dynamic (BGP) routing
Dynamic routing uses a
Cloud Router to
automatically manage the exchange of routes by using BGP. A BGP
interface on a Cloud Router in the same region as the corresponding
Cloud VPN tunnel manages this exchange. The Cloud Router adds
and removes routes without requiring that the tunnel be deleted and re-created.
The dynamic routing mode of your
VPC network controls the behavior of all its
Cloud Routers. This mode determines whether the routes learned
from your peer network are applied to Google Cloud resources in the
same region as the VPN tunnel, or if they are applied in all regions. You control
the routes advertised by your peer router or gateway.
The dynamic routing mode also determines whether subnet routes from only the
tunnel's region or all regions are shared with your peer router or gateway. In
addition to these subnet routes, you can configure custom route
advertisements
on a Cloud Router.
Static routing
Classic VPN tunnels support policy-based and route-based static
routing options. Consider a static routing option only if you cannot use dynamic
(BGP) routing or HA VPN.
Policy-based routing. Local IP ranges (left side) and remote IP ranges
(right side) are defined as part of the tunnel creation process.
Route-based VPN. When you use the Google Cloud console to create a
route-based VPN, you only specify a list of remote IP ranges. Those
ranges are used only to create routes in your VPC network
to peer resources.
You can find more information about these two static routing options in the
next section.
Note: The dynamic routing mode of a VPC network only
affects the behavior of Cloud Routers. It does not affect
Cloud VPN policy-based or route-based tunnels.
Traffic selectors
A traffic selector defines a set of IP address ranges or CIDR blocks used to
establish a VPN tunnel. These ranges are used as part of the IKE negotiation for
the tunnel. Some literature refers to traffic selectors as encryption domains .
There are two types of traffic selectors:
The local traffic selector defines the set of local IP ranges (CIDR
blocks) from the perspective of the VPN gateway that emits the VPN tunnel. For
Cloud VPN tunnels, the local traffic selector defines the set of
primary and secondary subnet CIDRs for
subnets in the VPC
network, representing the left side of the tunnel.
The remote traffic selector defines the set of remote IP ranges (CIDR
blocks) from the perspective of the VPN gateway that emits the VPN tunnel. For
Cloud VPN tunnels, the remote traffic selector is the right side or
peer network.
Traffic selectors are an intrinsic part of a VPN tunnel, used to establish
the IKE handshake. If either the local or remote CIDRs need to be changed,
the Cloud VPN tunnel and its peer counterpart tunnel must be
destroyed and re-created.
Important: In Google Cloud, a traffic selector (encryption domain) is
not the same thing as a route. When you use the Google Cloud console to
create a policy-based or route-based Cloud VPN tunnel, Google Cloud
automatically creates the necessary routes to peer networks in your
VPC network. If you use the Google Cloud CLI to create a
policy-based or route-based Cloud VPN tunnel, routes are not
automatically created; you must create the custom static routes manually.

Subject to restrictions on

Policy-based tunnels and traffic selectors
This section describes special considerations for traffic selectors when you
create policy-based Classic VPN tunnels. It does not apply to
any other type of Classic VPN or HA VPN
tunnel.
You can choose to specify the local traffic selector of a policy-based
Cloud VPN tunnel when you create it:
Custom local traffic selector. You can define the local traffic selector
as a set of subnets in the VPC network or a set of internal
IP addresses that include your chosen IP ranges of
subnets in the VPC network. IKEv1 limits local traffic
selectors to a single CIDR .
Custom mode VPC networks. Specify a custom local traffic
selector that consists of a range of internal IP addresses.
Auto mode VPC networks. If unspecified, the local traffic
selector is the primary IP range (CIDR block) of the automatically created
subnet in the same region as the Cloud VPN tunnel. Auto mode
VPC networks have one subnet per region with well-defined IP
ranges.
Legacy networks. If unspecified, the local traffic selector is defined
as the entire RFC 1918 IP address range of the legacy network.
Specify the remote traffic selector of a policy-based Cloud VPN tunnel
when you create it. If you use the Google Cloud console to create the
Cloud VPN tunnel, custom static routes whose destinations correspond to
the CIDRs of the remote traffic selector are automatically created. IKEv1
limits remote traffic selectors to a single CIDR . For
instructions, see
Create a
Classic VPN using static routing .
Important considerations for traffic selectors
Before you create a Cloud VPN policy-based tunnel, consider the
following:
Most VPN gateways only pass traffic through a VPN tunnel if the source IP
address of a packet fits in the tunnel's local traffic selector, and if the
destination IP address of a packet fits in the tunnel's remote traffic
selector. Some VPN devices don't enforce this requirement.
Cloud VPN supports traffic selector CIDRs of 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0
(any IP address). To determine if your peer VPN gateway does as well, consult
the documentation that came with your peer VPN gateway. Creating a
policy-based VPN tunnel with both traffic selectors set to 0.0.0.0/0 or
::/0 is functionally equivalent to creating a route-based VPN.
Carefully review multiple CIDRs per traffic selector to learn
how Cloud VPN implements IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
Cloud VPN disallows editing any traffic selectors after you have
created a VPN. To change either the local or the remote traffic selector for
a Cloud VPN tunnel, you must delete the tunnel and then recreate it.
You do not have to delete the Cloud VPN gateway, though.
If you convert an auto mode VPC network to a custom mode
VPC network, you might need to delete and re-create the
Cloud VPN tunnel (but not the gateway). This might be the case if
you add custom subnets, remove any automatically created subnets, or modify
the secondary IP ranges of any subnet. Avoid switching the mode of a
VPC network that has existing Cloud VPN tunnels.
For suggestions, review the considerations for auto mode
VPC networks .
For consistent and predictable VPN behavior, do the following:
Make both the local and remote traffic selectors as specific as possible.
Make the Cloud VPN local traffic selector the same as the remote
traffic selector configured for the corresponding tunnel on the peer
VPN gateway.
Make the Cloud VPN remote traffic selector the same as the local
traffic selector configured for the corresponding tunnel on the on-premises
VPN gateway.
Multiple CIDRs per traffic selector
When you create a policy-based Classic VPN tunnel, if you use
IKEv2, you can specify multiple CIDRs per traffic selector.
Cloud VPN always uses a single Child Security Association (SA),
regardless of IKE version.
The following table summarizes Cloud VPN support for multiple CIDRs
per traffic selector in policy-based VPN tunnels.
IKE version
Multiple CIDRs per traffic selector
IKEv1
No
The IKEv1 protocol only supports a single CIDR
per Child SA as defined in RFC 2407 and RFC 2409. Because
Cloud VPN requires a single Child SA per VPN tunnel, when
you use IKEv1, you can only supply a single CIDR for the local traffic
selector and a single CIDR for the remote traffic selector.
Cloud VPN does not support creating a VPN tunnel
by using IKEv1 with multiple Child SAs, each with a single CIDR.
IKEv2
Yes , if the following conditions are met:
Your peer VPN gateway uses a single Child SA. All CIDRs for the
local traffic selector and all
CIDRs for the remote traffic selector must be in a single
Child SA.
The number of CIDRs that you configure does not cause IKE proposal
packets to exceed Cloud VPN's maximum MTU of 1460 bytes.
If IKE proposals exceed this MTU, Cloud VPN tunnels don't
establish.
You don't exceed any restriction for the number of CIDRs supported
by your on-premises gateway. For details, consult your gateway vendor's
documentation.
A best practice is to use 30 or fewer CIDRs per traffic selector so that
you don't create an IKE proposal packet that exceeds the maximum MTU.
Important: When using IKEv2, your peer VPN gateway must accept all of
the CIDRs in each traffic selector by using a single Child SA. This is typically
done by adding all your local and remote IP ranges into a single "Phase 2"
(or "Quick Mode") configuration entry on your device, rather than creating a
separate Phase 2 configuration for each pair of IP ranges. Not all VPN gateways
support this action. VPN gateways that create a unique Child SA per CIDR are not
compatible with Cloud VPN. For more information, see the next section.
Tip: When using **IKEv2**, check how your on-premises device
handles multiple selectors to ensure they are negotiated in a single Child SA.
Example: Suppose you have two local ranges ( 10.0.0.0/24
and 10.0.1.0/24 ) and one remote range ( 192.168.1.0/24 ).
Correct: Create one Phase 2 configuration
containing both local ranges and the remote range. This results in a single Child SA.
Incorrect: Creating two Phase 2 configurations
(one for each local range) results in two Child SAs. In this scenario, the VPN
tunnel might fail to establish or experience intermittent connectivity.
Traffic selector strategies
Consider the following strategies if your on-premises VPN gateway creates
multiple Child SAs per VPN tunnel, or if multiple CIDRs per traffic selector
would cause an IKE proposal for IKEv2 to exceed 1460 bytes (for details, see
Routing options and traffic selectors ):
Use dynamic routing for the VPN tunnel. If your
peer VPN gateway supports BGP, configure both local and remote traffic selectors
for the VPN tunnel to allow any IP address. Use 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 only
or use 0.0.0.0/0,::/0 for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. Routes are exchanged
automatically between the peer VPN gateway and the Cloud Router
associated with your Cloud VPN tunnel. If you can use dynamic
routing, consider HA VPN.
Use broad, single CIDR traffic selectors and static tunnel routing:
Use a route-based VPN. Both traffic selectors are
0.0.0.0/0 by definition for route-based VPNs. You can create routes
that are more specific than the traffic selectors.
Use policy-based routing and configure the local
and remote traffic selectors to be as broad as possible. For policy-based
Cloud VPN tunnels, you can create routes to on-premises
networks in your VPC network whose destinations are more
specific than the CIDR blocks specified in the remote traffic selectors.
Use the gcloud CLI to create the routes separately from the
VPN tunnels by following the steps at
Create a Classic VPN
using static routing .
Use policy-based routing to create multiple Cloud VPN tunnels so
that each tunnel only has one CIDR block for its local traffic selector and
one CIDR block for its remote traffic selector. Configure the on-premises
counterpart tunnel in a similar way. Cloud VPN supports
multiple tunnels per gateway; however, using multiple tunnels has some
implications:
Your peer VPN gateway must offer separate external IP addresses to which
each Cloud VPN tunnel can connect. Tunnels on the same
Classic VPN gateway must connect to unique peer gateway
IP addresses. Your peer VPN gateway might also require that its tunnels
connect to unique IP addresses. In some situations, you need to
create a separate Cloud VPN gateway per Cloud VPN
tunnel.
When you use the Google Cloud console to create route-based or
policy-based Cloud VPN tunnels, routes to the peer network
are automatically created in addition to the tunnel. If routes are
automatically created for multiple VPN tunnels that each use the same
remote traffic selectors—as is the case if you create route-based
VPNs—you can have multiple routes in your
VPC network, all with identical destinations but different
next hops. This can lead to unpredictable or unexpected behavior because
traffic is delivered to a VPN tunnel according to the applicability
and order of routes . If you don't
use dynamic (BGP) tunnel routing, create and review static routes in
both your VPC network and your peer network.
