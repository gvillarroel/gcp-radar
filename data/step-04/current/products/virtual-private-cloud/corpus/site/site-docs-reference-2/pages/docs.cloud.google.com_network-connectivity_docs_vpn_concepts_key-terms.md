This page provides important terms that apply to Cloud VPN.
Review these terms to better understand how Cloud VPN works.
For more information, see the
Cloud VPN overview .
Cloud VPN terms
The following terms apply to Cloud VPN gateways and tunnels and
gateways on your peer network.
Cloud VPN gateway
A virtual VPN gateway running in Google Cloud managed by Google, using
a configuration that you specify in your project, and used only by you. Each
Cloud VPN gateway is a regional resource that uses one or more regional
external IP addresses. A Cloud VPN gateway can connect
to a peer VPN gateway.
Classic VPN
The predecessor to HA VPN. For more information, see
Types of
Cloud VPN: Classic VPN .
HA VPN
Replaces Classic VPN with a gateway that provides a 99.99%
availability SLA. For more information, see
Types of
Cloud VPN: HA VPN .
external VPN gateway
A gateway resource that you configure in Google Cloud for
HA VPN that provides information to Google Cloud
about your peer VPN gateway or gateways. Depending on the high availability
recommendations from your peer VPN gateway vendor, you can create an external
VPN gateway resource for the different types of peer VPN gateways described in
Cloud VPN
topologies .
Note: All peer gateway scenarios are
represented in Google Cloud by a single external peer VPN resource.
peer VPN gateway
A gateway that is connected to a Cloud VPN gateway. A peer VPN
gateway can be one of the following:
Another Cloud VPN gateway
A VPN gateway hosted by another cloud provider such as AWS or Microsoft Azure
An on-premises VPN device or VPN service
Note: Cloud VPN instructions
are written from the point of view of your
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, so the peer VPN gateway is the gateway that connects
to Cloud VPN.
remote peer IP address
For an HA VPN gateway interface that connects to an external
VPN gateway, the remote peer IP address is the IP address of the interface on the external
VPN gateway that is used for the tunnel.
For an HA VPN gateway interface that connects to
another HA VPN gateway, the remote peer IP address is
the IP address of the other HA VPN gateway's interface
that is used for the tunnel.
For Classic VPN, the remote peer IP address is the external IP address
of the peer VPN gateway.
VPN tunnel
A VPN tunnel connects two VPN gateways and serves as a virtual medium through
which encrypted traffic is passed. Two VPN tunnels must be established to
create a connection between two VPN gateways: each tunnel defines the
connection from the perspective of its gateway, and traffic can only pass after
the pair of tunnels is established. A Cloud VPN tunnel is
always associated with a specific Cloud VPN gateway resource.
connection
As defined for Google Cloud, a logical link between
Cloud VPN and peer VPN locations as identified by
a vpnGateway resource at one end, and an
externalVpnGateway or another
Google Cloud VpnGateway resource at the peer end. A connection
also includes all the vpnTunnel resources and BGP sessions
between the gateway resources.
Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
IKE is the protocol used for authentication and to negotiate a session key for
encrypting traffic.
Note: Cloud VPN always initiates IKE. If two
Cloud VPN gateways are involved, either can act as the IKE initiator.
Cloud VPN gateway MTU
The size in bytes of the largest IP packet—including headers, data,
and IPsec overhead—supported by a Cloud VPN tunnel.
Cloud VPN payload MTU
The size in bytes of the largest IP packet—including headers and
data—that can be successfully encrypted and sent in a
Cloud VPN tunnel without fragmentation. In other words, the
original packet size not counting IPsec overhead.
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect gateway
MTU
The size in bytes of the largest IP packet—including headers, data,
and IPsec overhead—supported by a
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect tunnel.
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect
payload MTU
The size in bytes of the largest IP packet—including headers and
data—that can be successfully encrypted and sent in a
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect tunnel without fragmentation. In other
words, the original packet size not counting Cloud Interconnect
overhead and IPsec overhead.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) terms
The following terminology applies to the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) ,
which Cloud VPN and Cloud Interconnect use for dynamic routing.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
An exterior gateway routing protocol standardized by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) in RFC 1722 .
BGP automatically exchanges routing and reachability information among autonomous
systems on the internet. Your device is BGP-capable if it can perform BGP
routing, which means that you can enable the BGP protocol on it and assign it a
BGP IP address and an autonomous system number. To determine if your
device supports BGP, see the vendor information for your device or contact your device's vendor.
autonomous system (AS)
A collection of connected IP routing prefixes under the control of a single
administrative entity or domain that presents a common routing policy to the
internet, such as an internet service provider (ISP), a large company,
or a university.
autonomous system number (ASN)
A unique identifier allocated to each autonomous system that uses BGP routing.
For more information, see
RFC 7300 .
MD5 authentication
A method of BGP peer authentication that uses the MD5 message-digest algorithm. When you
use this approach, BGP peers must use the same authentication key, or a connection cannot be
established between them. Later, every segment routed between the peers is verified. For
more information about MD5 authentication, see
RFC 2385 . To
find out whether your device supports MD5 authentication, see the vendor information for the
device or contact the vendor. To get support with using Cloud Router MD5 authentication,
see Support .
Google Cloud terms
The following terminology applies to Google Cloud and its features.
Google Cloud
Google Cloud is a suite of public cloud computing services offered by Google.
For more information, see
Google Cloud products .
project ID
The ID of your Google Cloud project. A project contains networking
resources such as networks, subnets, and Cloud VPN gateways as described
in the VPC network overview . For a
description of the difference between project name , project ID , and project
number , see
Identifying projects .
You can view the project ID in the
Google Cloud console .
