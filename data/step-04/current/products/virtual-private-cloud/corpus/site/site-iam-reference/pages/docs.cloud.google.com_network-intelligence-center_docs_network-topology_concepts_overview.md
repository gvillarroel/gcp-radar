Network Topology overview
Network Topology is a visualization tool that shows the topology of your
network infrastructure:
Infrastructure view: Shows Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, hybrid
connectivity to and from your on-premises networks, connectivity to
Google-managed services, and the associated metrics.
GKE Enterprise view (for GKE Enterprise
enabled projects): Shows the infrastructure of your
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) deployments: clusters, namespaces, workloads,
pods, and their associated metrics.
You can also view metrics and details of network traffic to other Shared VPC
networks and inter-region traffic. Network Topology combines
configuration information with real-time operational data in a single view. This
view makes it easier to understand networking relationships between various
workloads on Google Cloud and their current state, such as the traffic paths and
throughput between virtual machine (VM) instances.
Network Topology lays out information in a
graph
format, where the nodes and lines represent
entities and connections in your network.
How it works
Network Topology collects real-time telemetry and configuration data
from Google's infrastructure to visualize your resources. It captures elements
such as configuration information, metrics, and logs to infer relationships
between resources in a project or in multiple projects. After collecting each
element, Network Topology combines them to generate a graph that
represents your deployment.
Benefits
Using Network Topology provides the following benefits:
You can view the topology of your deployments. No additional
configurations or agents are required to use Network Topology.
You can use Network Topology graphs to understand your
Google Cloud infrastructure. You don't need to view multiple logs or use
third-party tools.
You can use Network Topology to help you analyze the performance of
your network. You can drill down and view various metrics that can help you
identify unexpected patterns.
You can use filters to help you highlight and focus on specific
resources, especially when you need to diagnose and troubleshoot issues.
You can view cross-project metrics for network traffic sent across
Shared VPC or VPC Network Peering boundaries within the same
organization.
You can view insights for entities with high egress metric values for further
analysis and troubleshooting.
Considerations
Important: If there are many projects and the topology graph is too large to be
displayed in a browser, a truncated graph is displayed. Some connections and
nodes might be missing from the displayed graph. You can remove some projects or
resources from this metrics scope. Or, to reduce the graph's size, show data
only for the current project. Note that the metrics are not
sampled or truncated. A message appears below the graph saying that the graph is
too large.
Network Topology captures six weeks of history.
Network Topology visualizes entities and connections only if they
have communicated (sent or received traffic) during the selected time period. A
connection between entities exists if base entities in their respective
hierarchies are in communication. For example, Network Topology
connects regions us-east4 and europe-west1 if at least one VM instance in
each region communicates with the other. Although other resources
might exist, Network Topology doesn't show them if they didn't
receive or send traffic.
For more information, see Data collection and freshness .
Resources and traffic
A Network Topology graph shows your resources and traffic as entities
and connections. Network Topology aggregates related resources into
hierarchical entities, where each resource type has its own hierarchy. The
following sections describe the resources (entities) and traffic paths
(connections) that Network Topology can graph.
Entities
A base entity is the lowest level of a particular hierarchy and represents a
resource that can directly communicate with other resources over a network, such
as a VM instance or a GKE pod for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Enterprise edition
projects.
When you have multiple networks and many base entities, displaying
everything in a flat view can be overwhelming. To address this issue,
Network Topology aggregates base entities into hierarchical entities
that you can expand or collapse. When you first view a
Network Topology graph, it aggregates all of the base entities into
their top-level hierarchy.
For example, Network Topology aggregates the entities as follows:
VM instances into their instance group, then aggregates instance groups into a
Google Cloud zone
GKE pods into their GKE workloads, then
aggregates GKE workloads into GKE
namespaces, and then the GKE namespaces into a
GKE cluster. This is available only for
GKE Enterprise enabled projects.
Network Topology represents a base or hierarchical entity as a
circular node in a graph. Each base entity possesses its own hierarchy. For
example, load balancers have a different hierarchy than VM instances.
Note: When you drill down into a hierarchy, Network Topology might
skip a level. If a particular hierarchy contains only one entity,
Network Topology skips that level until it reaches a level that
contains multiple entities or base entities. For an example, see the Auditing
network performance use case.
The following table shows the base entities and their aggregation hierarchies.
In a graph, Network Topology represents each base entity by using
an icon shown in the table.

location of the client. For example, if you deliver content through
Cloud CDN, the IP address observed by Network Topology might
not be the actual address of the external client.

Note: In the topology view and as part of the Pod metrics,
Network Topology does not show the IPv6 IP address of the dual stack
Pods.
Connections
Network Topology represents traffic between entities as lines, such
as traffic between VM instances. Network Topology connects entities
if at least one side of the connection is sending traffic.
Network Topology shows connections at various levels of a hierarchy
as long as their base entities are in communication. For example,
Network Topology shows a connection between two regions if at least
one VM instance in each region is communicating with the other.
Network Topology supports TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMPV6, ESP, and GRE
traffic for certain traffic paths. The following list describes the paths that
Network Topology visualizes between entities:
Traffic in a VPC network such as traffic between VM instances
and internal load balancers that are in the same network.
Traffic across peered VPC networks such as traffic between VM
instances and internal load balancers that are in peer VPC
networks.
Traffic between Google Cloud and the internet such as traffic between
clients on the internet and entities (for example, VM instances or
external Application Load Balancers that have external IP addresses).
Traffic to and from Cloud VPN gateways, Cloud Interconnect
connections, and router appliance instances.
The following list describes the paths that Network Topology
visualizes between entities in the GKE Enterprise view, available
only for GKE Enterprise projects:
Traffic within a GKE cluster such as the traffic between
pairs of GKE pods on different GKE nodes.
Network Topology doesn't show metrics for the traffic between the
GKE nodes within a cluster.
Traffic between two pods within the same GKE node if intranode
visibility is enabled.
Traffic between GKE clusters and external IP addresses
such as service flows. These connections might flow through load balancers.
Google-managed services
Network Topology also visualizes traffic to and from Google-managed
services. Google Cloud users can use Network Topology to audit
their networking configuration and troubleshoot networking issues related to the
different Google services in use.
Network Topology supports direct access of VMs to Google-managed
services by using a default route with a next hop as the
default-internet-gateway or
Private Google Access . It does not
support the following access methods to Google-managed services:
External traffic from the internet
Direct Google access from the VMs
Private Google Access from on-premises hosts
Network Topology doesn't show traffic to or from some of the
Google-managed services such as App Engine Memcache, Filestore, Memorystore, Cloud SQL, and partner and marketplace solutions.
IP address considerations
For traffic between VM instances in Google Cloud that communicate using external
IP addresses, Network Topology does not display a single connection
directly between the VMs. Instead, Network Topology displays the traffic
as if it were to and from an external location by using two
connections: one connection between the first VM and the country of the second
VM, and another connection between the second VM and the country of the first VM.
Network interface considerations
Network Topology only visualizes traffic to or from the first network
interface ( nic0 ) of a VM.
For VMs that use internal IP addresses to communicate, Network Topology
only displays a connection if both VMs are communicating by using their first
network interface ( nic0 -to- nic0 ).
For VMs that use external IP addresses to communicate, Network Topology
normally displays two connections as described in
IP address considerations . However, if only one
of the VMs is using nic0 , Network Topology only displays a connection
for that VM. For example, if one VM is communicating through nic0 and the other
VM is communicating through nic1 , Network Topology only displays
a connection between the nic0 VM and a country.
Metrics for entities
Network Topology shows the average traffic within the selected hour. You can
also view average packet loss for the hour and median latency (RTT) for many
entity types.
Metrics for the selected hour on the timeline include the following:
Average hourly throughput available for most entities
Average hourly packet loss available for traffic within Google Cloud
regions and zones
Hourly median latency (RTT) available for many entity types
In the GKE Enterprise view available for
GKE Enterprise projects, the metrics for the selected hour on the
timeline also include the following:
Average hourly throughput available for most entities
Median latency available for traffic within Google Cloud regions and
zones with GKE clusters
Network verdict metrics displaying the GKE workloads with the
most dropped and most forwarded traffic flows for the selected cluster
You can also download the table of outliers in a CSV format for the
High egress and Network verdict traffic insights.
Insights for entities with high metric values
In addition to the average hourly metrics, Network Topology also
shows the ranking of VMs or instance groups that generate
the highest egress. Network Topology provides dedicated views that
rank resources where you can start your troubleshooting and analysis.
In the Infrastructure view, the insights for metrics for the selected hour on
the timeline include the following:
High egress instances: aggregated hourly values for various types of
egress
High egress instance groups: aggregated hourly values for various types
of egress
In the GKE Enterprise view available for
GKE Enterprise projects, the insights for metrics for the
selected hour on the timeline include the following:
High egress GKE workloads: aggregated hourly values for
various types of egress for GKE workloads, in the
GKE Enterprise view
Filter the traffic based on the traffic types
You can further filter the traffic based on the following traffic types:
All egress traffic for an entity
Cross-zonal egress traffic: useful for analyzing billable traffic
Egress to internet: used for analyzing billable traffic and for
analyzing the traffic that reaches external endpoints
Hybrid egress: used to analyze the volume of traffic to
on-premises, including Cloud Interconnect, Cloud VPN, and
Router appliance connections
In the GKE Enterprise view, you can further filter the traffic
based on the following traffic types:
All measured egress traffic from the selected entity
Cross-zonal egress traffic: useful for analyzing billable traffic
between Google Cloud zones
Multiple projects
Network Topology visualizes resources in your project, or you can
use Cloud Monitoring, which can visualize metrics for multiple
Google Cloud projects. When you configure Cloud Monitoring to have access to
the metrics for multiple projects, Network Topology can show
network traffic that crosses multiple projects.
For example, assume that you have two VM instances in two different projects.
vm-a is in project-a , and vm-b is in project-b . Both VM instances
communicate with each other and are in a Shared VPC network. If you only
have visibility into project-b , Network Topology shows vm-b but
nothing to indicate that it communicated with vm-a . However, if you
configure Cloud Monitoring to view metrics for both projects,
Network Topology shows
vm-a , vm-b , and their communication.
Cloud Monitoring is especially useful for Shared VPC
and VPC Network Peering scenarios, where resources or networks can be in
different projects. For more information, see
View metrics for multiple Cloud projects .
Project aggregation
When you view multiple projects in a Network Topology graph, you can
aggregate Google Cloud entities by project and then by their standard
hierarchies. This option lets you view resources by project. Entities
outside of Google Cloud, such as external clients, aren't included in
project aggregation.
As an example, if you aggregate by project and then expand a project, the graph
shows a region entity for each region that contains a VM instance. If you don't
use project aggregation, the graph shows all of the entities as if they were in
the same project. To enable project aggregation, see
Aggregate entities by project .
Change project scope
To view multiple projects in Network Topology, configure a
metrics scope and add monitored projects to it.
When you add projects to a metrics scope, then this metrics scope lets you
monitor the data for the scoping project and the monitored projects. From this
metrics scope, you can access the combined metrics of the scoping project
and the monitored projects. For more information, see
View metrics for multiple projects .
To make use of an existing metrics scope and monitor multiple Google Cloud
projects in a single view, select the scoping project using the Google Cloud console
project picker or the Change Scope button. You can also select a single
monitoring project using these options.
Data collection and freshness
Network Topology captures six weeks of history.
The Network Topology history is divided into hourly snapshots, which
start at the beginning of an hour. For each hourly snapshot, the graph shows
base entities and their communication that occurred during that hour. For
example, if two instances communicated with each other and then were deleted
during the hour, they would appear for that hour even though they no longer
exist.
The visualization of entities and their connections includes overlaid metrics on
the connections where applicable. Network Topology also displays
separate time series charts that show metrics such as the traffic throughput
between communicating entities or the CPU utilization of VM instances. The time
series charts don't have the same hourly constraints as the visualized
entities, connections, and overlaid metrics.
For more information about viewing metrics, see
Monitor your networking configuration with Network Topology .
Present snapshot
When you view the present time, the Network Topology graph shows an
hourly snapshot from the previous hour. Each time that you load a graph,
Network Topology shows the latest available snapshot.
For more details about each component and its data during the
present segment, see the following table.
For this component
Data comes from this time period
And is available at this time
Example
Entities and connections
The previous hour
Immediately after each hour 1
If the current time is 01:19 PM, the graph visualizes entities
that communicated from 12:00 PM to 01:00 PM, but the graph
can change. At 01:20 PM the graph is fixed and won't change.
Overlaid metric values
The previous hour 2
As entities and connections become available
If the current time is 10:37 AM and the selected
metric is Traffic , the overlaid values are an average
from 09:55 AM to 10:00 AM.
Time series charts
Real-time, with historical data from a timeframe that you specify.
The default timeframe shows minute-by-minute metric values from the past
hour. The available timeframes range from 1 hour to
6 weeks 3 .
At most 7 minutes after an activity
If the current time is 10:37 AM and you open the time series charts
for a VM, you see minute-by-minute metric values for the hour from
09:37 AM to 10:37 AM.
1 The graph can change up to 20 minutes after the end of an hour.
2 The traffic and packet
loss metrics use the average of the selected hour, while latency uses
the median.
3 The aggregation interval , or how often the data is sampled,
depends on the timeframe. For example, the 1 hour timeframe has an
aggregation interval of 1 minute, while the 1 day timeframe has
an aggregation interval of 1 hour.
Past snapshots
For details about each component and its data when viewing
past snapshots, see the following table.
For this component
Data comes from this time period
Example
Entities and connections
An hour that you select from the past
11:00 AM to 12:00 PM from the previous day
Overlaid metric values
The selected hour 1
If you select the segment that runs from 11:00 AM to
12:00 PM on the previous day and the selected metric is
Traffic , the overlaid values are an average from
11:55 AM to 12:00 PM.
Time series charts
Real-time, with historical data from a timeframe that you specify.
The default timeframe shows minute-by-minute metric values from the past
hour. The available timeframes range from 1 hour to
6 weeks 2 .
If you set the timeframe of the time series chart to 1 day ,
the chart shows metric values from the current time to 24 hours ago
using a 5-minute aggregation interval.
1 The traffic and packet
loss metrics use the average of the last one hour, while latency uses the median.
2 The aggregation interval , or how often the data is sampled,
depends on the timeframe. For example, the 1 hour timeframe has an
aggregation interval of 1 minute, while the 1 day timeframe has
an aggregation interval of 1 hour.
