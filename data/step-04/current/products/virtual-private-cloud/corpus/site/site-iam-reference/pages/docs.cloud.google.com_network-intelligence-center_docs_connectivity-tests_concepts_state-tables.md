Configuration analysis states
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A Connectivity Test configuration analysis goes through a
series of test states as it checks the configuration of each Google Cloud
resource in a network path from a designated source to a designated destination.
Use this reference to interpret these states.
For more information about Connectivity Tests, including details about
live data plane analysis, see the
overview .
Test states
A Connectivity Test configuration analysis provides data
for the following test
states in the order listed:
Initial state
Configuration checking state
Forwarding state
Transition state
Special state
Final state
Overall reachability result
Some of these states appear in every trace, while others only appear when
testing the configuration of a specific Google Cloud resource or when
performing a certain task.
The final state and the overall reachability result provide the most important
test output.
In addition, test output can include metadata for Google Cloud resources
that are associated with one or more of the states; for example,
information about a virtual machine (VM) instance's name and IP address.
How the configuration analysis evaluates reachability
The configuration analysis simulates a test packet through a network path by
verifying configurations for Google Cloud resources in that path. Some
examples of invalid network configurations are a Cloud Load Balancing
forwarding rule that has no backends or a network route that doesn't exist.
During the configuration checking state ,
Connectivity Tests collects information about
network routes such as user-configured routes, dynamic routes based on BGP
advertisements, or policy-based routes. The configuration analysis then chooses
a network route based on applicability and order .
For the configuration checking state, verified means
that Connectivity Tests confirms that a configuration for the
Google Cloud resource tested is valid. The configuration allows the
simulated test packet to continue through the network path being tested.
For ingress and egress firewall rules, verified
means that the configuration analysis confirms that the firewall rule is valid.
The firewall rule permits the simulated test packet to pass.
If Connectivity Tests determines that a configuration is invalid,
the packet has a final state of Drop .
Overall reachability result
Note: Knowing the overall reachability result can be helpful for setting up
monitoring or automation.
The configuration analysis provides an overall summary of reachability
status, also known as a result. Results can have one of four values:
Reachable , Unreachable , Ambiguous , and Undetermined .
Values table
The following table describes the value for each type of overall reachability
result.
Overall reachability result
Description
Reachable
There are two possible scenarios. In both scenarios,
Connectivity Tests does not find any configuration issues.
Thus, both scenarios are considered Reachable .
In the first scenario, the packet originating
from the source is expected to reach its destination. The final state
of one or more traces is Deliver .
In the second scenario, the analysis is partially complete
based on configurations where the user has permission. The final state
of one or more traces is Forward .
Unreachable
The packet originating from the source is expected to be dropped before
reaching its destination. The final state of all the traces is
Drop .
Ambiguous
This result is returned if the source and destination endpoints do
not uniquely identify the test location in the network, and the overall
reachability result contains multiple traces with mixed
Reachable and Unreachable states.
In this case, the final states among multiple traces return different
final states. The Ambiguous result doesn't apply to tests
that contain only one trace.
Undetermined
Reachability could not be determined. The final state for one trace
is Forward or
Abort . For multiple traces, the
final state is a combination of either Forward or
Abort .
The reachability from the source to the destination cannot be
determined for one of the following reasons:
The analysis is aborted due to a permission error. The user
does not have read permission to the projects listed in the test.
The analysis is aborted due to internal errors.
Multiple traces
Each configuration analysis can contain multiple traces, and the
final state of these traces might not be the same. For example, a packet to
the VIP for a Google Cloud load balancer might have n traces if there
are n backend VM instances configured for the load balancer. These n traces
might not have the same final states.
Because an analysis can produce multiple possible
traces, the following is true:
If there is only one trace result, the overall reachability
result is the same as the final state of the trace.
If there are multiple trace results, the overall reachability
result is calculated based on the distribution of the final states contained
in all of the traces.
Result metadata
In addition to the overall reachability result for traces, every
test result contains the following metadata:
The time the test state for the test was verified
Error details of a test failure or cancellation
Trace details for each trace
Error details of a test failure or cancellation are shown as codes and messages
displayed in the overall reachability result. For example, a test with a
final state of Abort might show an error message such as
Failed to pull initial config. An internal error occurred.
Initial state
During the initial state, the configuration analysis simulates starting
from a network endpoint .
Message
Description
START_FROM_INSTANCE
The packet originated from a Compute Engine instance.
InstanceInfo metadata was
populated by Connectivity Tests.
START_FROM_INTERNET
The packet originated from the internet.
EndpointInfo metadata was
populated by Connectivity Tests.
START_FROM_PRIVATE_NETWORK
The packet originated from a VPC network or an
on-premises network with an internal source IP address. If the source
was a VPC network visible to the user, the
NetworkInfo metadata
was populated with network details by Connectivity Tests.
START_FROM_CLOUD_FUNCTION
The packet originated from a Cloud Run function.
CloudFunctionInfo metadata was
populated by Connectivity Tests.
START_FROM_CLOUD_RUN_REVISION
The packet originated from a revision of a
Cloud Run service.
CloudRunRevisionInfo metadata was
populated by Connectivity Tests.
START_FROM_APP_ENGINE_VERSION
The packet originated from a version of an App Engine standard environment service.
AppEngineVersionInfo metadata
was populated by Connectivity Tests.
Final state
There are four final states: Drop , Abort ,
Forward , and Deliver . Each of the
following sections has a table that contains messages and descriptions for each
state.
Drop
Connectivity Tests dropped the simulated test packet because the
test target was unreachable for the following reasons.
Message
Description
UNKNOWN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS
The destination external address can't be resolved to a known target.
FOREIGN_IP_DISALLOWED
The VM instance can only send or receive a packet
with a foreign IP address if ip_forward is enabled. In other
words, the foreign IP address failed a
spoof check .
FIREWALL_RULE
Dropped due to a firewall rule unless allowed due to
connection tracking .
Connectivity Tests might deny a test packet because the
packet matches a
blocking firewall rule. However, the actual data plane might allow the
packet through due to connection tracking on the firewall rule. Connection
tracking allows packets for an existing connection to return in spite of
the firewall rule.
NO_ROUTE
Dropped due to no routes.
ROUTE_BLACKHOLE
Dropped because the next hop of the matched route doesn't exist.
ROUTE_WRONG_NETWORK
The packet was sent to the wrong (unintended) network, as shown in
Detect invalid or inconsistent
configurations .
PRIVATE_TRAFFIC_TO_INTERNET
A packet with an internal destination address was sent to an internet
gateway.
PRIVATE_GOOGLE_ACCESS_DISALLOWED
A VM instance with only an internal IP address tried to access
a Google API or Google service, but Private Google Access was not
enabled.
NO_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS
A VM instance with only an internal IP address tried to access external
hosts through a route whose next hop is the default internet gateway.
Expected when Cloud NAT is not enabled in the subnet or when there's
no other default route that uses a different type of next hop (such as a
proxy VM).
UNKNOWN_INTERNAL_ADDRESS
A destination internal address could not be resolved to a known target.
FORWARDING_RULE_MISMATCH
A forwarding rule's protocol and ports did not match the packet header,
or the packet does not originate from or is not directed to the same region
as the regional load balancer.
FORWARDING_RULE_NO_INSTANCES
A forwarding rule did not have backends configured.
FIREWALL_BLOCKING_LOAD_BALANCER_BACKEND_HEALTH_CHECK
A firewall rule blocked the health check probes to
the backends and
caused
the backends to be unavailable for traffic from the load balancer.
As part of its testing sequence for Cloud Load Balancing,
the configuration analysis verifies that existing
firewall rules have been configured to allow a health check probing
packet to be sent to the Cloud Load Balancing backends. This
configuration check results in a healthCheckFirewallState .
For details, see
Health check
firewall rules .
INSTANCE_NOT_RUNNING
A packet was sent from or to a VM instance that was not in a running
state.
TRAFFIC_TYPE_BLOCKED
The type of traffic was blocked and the user could not configure a
firewall rule to enable it. For details, see
Always blocked traffic .
GKE_MASTER_UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS
Access to the Google Kubernetes Engine
control plane
endpoint was not authorized. For details, see
Access
to the cluster endpoints .
DROPPED_INSIDE_GKE_SERVICE
A packet was dropped inside the Google Kubernetes Engine service.
CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS
Access to the Cloud SQL instance endpoint is not authorized. For
details, see
Authorizing with authorized
networks .
DROPPED_INSIDE_CLOUD_SQL_SERVICE
A packet was dropped inside the Cloud SQL service.
GOOGLE_MANAGED_SERVICE_NO_PEERING
A packet was dropped because there is no peering between the originating
network and the Google-managed services network.
CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_NO_IP_ADDRESS
A packet was dropped because the Cloud SQL instance has neither a
private nor a public IP address.
PSC_CONNECTION_NOT_ACCEPTED
A packet was dropped because the connection to the published service
that uses Private Service Connect is not accepted.
CLOUD_FUNCTION_NOT_ACTIVE
A packet was dropped because the Cloud Run function is not active.
VPC_CONNECTOR_NOT_SET
A packet was dropped because the App Engine standard environment service, the
Cloud Run function, or the Cloud Run revision doesn't
have a Serverless VPC Access
connector configured.
VPC_CONNECTOR_NOT_RUNNING
A packet was dropped because the
Serverless VPC Access
connector is not running.
CLOUD_RUN_REVISION_NOT_READY
A packet was dropped because the Cloud Run revision is not
ready and cannot serve traffic.
Abort
The configuration analysis was stopped because of lack of basic
information, such as lack of access to the network configuration.
This state usually happens when Connectivity Tests does not have the
correct permissions to obtain the configuration from the host project for a
service project, as shown in the following table.
Message
Description
UNKNOWN_NETWORK
Aborted due to an unknown network. The analysis cannot proceed
because, in a Shared VPC network, the user running the test
does not have access to the host project's network configurations,
including firewall rules and routes.
Running a Connectivity Test requires that the user
running the test can read configurations for resources such as
routes in the host project. This happens because network
resources are allocated in the host project, but the actual
resources exist in the service project.
UNKNOWN_IP
The analysis aborted because the IP addresses required for analysis
were unknown. This is due to incorrect user input, or the configuration
analysis could not determine a
valid endpoint based on the provided input parameters.
In a Shared VPC network, the user running the test did not have
access to the host project's network configurations. This access is
required for testing against IP addresses in the service project.
UNKNOWN_PROJECT
The analysis aborted because no project information could be derived from
the input to the Connectivity Test. This is due to
incorrect user input or, based on the provided input parameters,
the analysis could not determine a valid project.
PERMISSION_DENIED
The analysis was aborted because the user lacked the permission to access
all or part of the network configurations required to run the test.
NO_SOURCE_LOCATION
The analysis aborted because no valid source endpoint could be derived
from the test input. This is due to incorrect user input or, based on the
provided input parameters, the analysis could not
determine a valid source endpoint.
INVALID_ARGUMENT
The analysis aborted because the source and/or destination endpoint
specified in the test input were invalid. The possible reasons for this
message include the following:
A malformed IP address
A non-existent VM instance or network URI
An IP address that is not in the range of the specified network URI
A VM instance that doesn't own the network
interface in the specified network
NO_EXTERNAL_IP
The analysis aborted because traffic was sent from a public IP address
to a VM instance that did not have an external IP address.
UNINTENDED_DESTINATION
The analysis aborted because none of the traces were able to match
the destination information specified in the test input.
TRACE_TOO_LONG
The analysis aborted because the number of steps in the trace
exceeded a certain limit. This issue might be caused by a routing loop.
INTERNAL_ERROR
Aborted due to internal server error.
SOURCE_ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND
Aborted because the source endpoint could not be found.
MISMATCHED_SOURCE_NETWORK
Aborted because the source network does not match the source endpoint.
DESTINATION_ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND
Aborted because the destination endpoint could not be found.
MISMATCHED_DESTINATION_NETWORK
Aborted because the destination network does not match the destination endpoint.
Forward
The analysis stopped at a specific endpoint and
could go no further:
The analysis is partially complete based on configurations where the user
has permission.
The test packet was forwarded to a network with an unknown configuration.
The test target has not been dropped according to the known configuration,
and the test packet has been forwarded to a network where
Connectivity Tests has no visibility.
Message
Forwarded
PEERING_VPC
To a peer VPC network
VPN_GATEWAY
To a Cloud VPN gateway
INTERCONNECT
To a Cloud Interconnect connection
GKE_MASTER
To a GKE control plane
IMPORTED_CUSTOM_ROUTE_NEXT_HOP
To the next hop of a custom route imported from a peered
VPC network
CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE
To a Cloud SQL instance
Deliver
The analysis was able to reach the target and deliver
the simulated test packet.
A final state of Deliver does not guarantee that traffic can pass through the
data plane. The purpose of the analysis is to validate configuration issues
that might cause traffic to drop.
Message

caused that state.
DropInfo
Cause of a Drop final state and the resource URI that
caused that state.
ForwardInfo
The target type and target resource URI that a test packet was finally
forwarded to ( Forward final state).
Other states
Before the test packet reaches one of the final states, it goes through the
following intermediate states: configuration checking state,
forwarding state, transition state, and special state.
Configuration checking state
During the configuration checking state, Connectivity Tests checks the
configuration of Google Cloud resources in the simulated network path,
verifies that the resource configuration is valid, and verifies that the
configuration allows the simulated test packet to continue on through the network
path.
If needed, the configuration analysis performs a spoof check.

Verified ingress firewall rule.
APPLY_EGRESS_FIREWALL_RULE
Verified egress firewall rule.
APPLY_ROUTE
Verified route.
APPLY_FORWARDING_RULE
Matched forwarding rule.
SPOOFING_APPROVED
The packet was sent or received under a foreign IP address, but allowed.
For details, see
spoof checking .
Forwarding state
During the forwarding state, Connectivity Tests simulates a packet
arriving at an intermediate Google Cloud resource in the testing path
(for example, a packet arriving at a Cloud VPN gateway or a
Google Cloud load balancer).
Message
Description
ARRIVE_AT_INSTANCE
Arrived at a Compute Engine VM instance.
ARRIVE_AT_INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER
Arrived at a Google Cloud load balancer that uses a private IP
address as a VIP.

Transition state
During the transition state, Connectivity Tests verifies simulated
configurations where a packet is changed (for example, where Cloud NAT
translates a packet header, or when a Google Cloud load balancing proxy
terminates and reinitiates an inbound TCP session to VM instances).
Message
Description
NAT
The packet header was translated.
PROXY_CONNECTION
The original connection was terminated, and a new
proxied connection was initiated.
