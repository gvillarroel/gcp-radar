Detect invalid or inconsistent configurations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: Connectivity Tests performs a
static analysis
of the resource configurations in your VPC network. This analysis
does not represent the actual condition of the network data plane.
This page shows examples of invalid or inconsistent configurations of
Google Cloud resources that you might encounter when troubleshooting your
network with Connectivity Tests.
Note: The configuration failure examples shown in this document are a
subset of all issues that Connectivity Tests can discover through its analysis. For the
complete list of failure causes, see
Configuration analysis states .
For instructions about how to run tests, see
Create and run
Connectivity Tests .
For a description of testing to and from common network source
and destination types, see
Common use cases .
Detect an invalid configuration
There are many different types of invalid configurations; that is,
configurations that are not correct or that have been updated and are no longer
valid.
One example is a virtual machine (VM) instance that has been
configured as a NAT gateway ,
but which has been
deleted
or migrated. In this case, the route to the VM instance still exists.
In the following diagram, VM1 in Network 1 should be able to access data on
VM2 , VM3 , and VM4 in Network 2 through a VM instance named nat_vm_1 .
However, nat_vm_1 no longer exists because it has migrated to a new VM,
nat_vm_2 .
The configured route from VM1 to the other three VM instances still
points to nat_vm_1 as the next hop. However, because nat_vm_1 no longer
exists and there is no route to nat_vm_2 , VM1 can't communicate with the
other VM instances.
A Connectivity Test run from VM1 to VM2 reveals that the
traffic between VM1 and the other VM instances has been dropped due to an
invalid next hop for the route to the other VMs.

In contrast, in the use case for an
inconsistent configuration ,
VM3 is missing a network tag, making the load balancer configuration
inconsistent
across the load balancer backends. However, the configuration for VM3 itself
is valid because configuring a VM instance doesn't require a tag.
Detect an inconsistent configuration
You can also use Connectivity Tests to routinely validate
inconsistent
configurations. These configurations might not be causing any current
connectivity issues, but might unintentionally reduce network redundancy or
cause performance issues in the future.
The load balancer is configured to send traffic to an external IP address of
35.184.176.28 . The traffic to that address is distributed across three
backends: VM1 , VM2 , and VM3 . However, because of a missing network tag
on
VM3 , the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) firewall rule allows traffic from
external IP ranges to VM1 and VM2 , but denies that traffic to VM3 .
The following trace from the allowed source ranges configured for the load
balancer to the destination external IP address of the load balancer shows the
intended configuration and the inconsistency. VM1 and VM2 are reachable,
but
VM3 is unreachable. Only the two backends are reachable because VM3 has
failed the health check.
