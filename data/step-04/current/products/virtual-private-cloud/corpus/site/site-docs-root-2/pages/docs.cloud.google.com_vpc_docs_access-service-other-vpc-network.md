Access the service from another VPC network
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial explains how you, as a service consumer , can access your
published service by creating a Private Service Connect
endpoint . When you send requests to the endpoint,
Private Service Connect forwards those requests to the published
service.
This tutorial is intended for cloud architects, network architects, network
administrators, and IT administrators.
Objectives
Configure networking for the service consumer resources
Create an endpoint
Test accessing the endpoint
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Virtual Private Cloud
Compute Engine
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
Complete the previous two tutorials in this series:
Create a load-balanced service .
Make the
service accessible from other VPC networks . You need the
service attachment ID to complete this tutorial.
Create or select a project to use for the service consumer resources.
This project is referred to as CONSUMER_PROJECT
In the Google Cloud console, go to the project selector page.
Go to project selector
Select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Enable the Compute Engine API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Make sure that you have the following role or roles on the project:
Compute Engine > Compute Network Admin, Compute Engine > Compute Instance Admin
Check for the roles
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Select the project.
In the Principal column, find all rows that identify you or a group that
you're included in. To learn which groups you're included in, contact your
administrator.
For all rows that specify or include you, check the Role column to see whether
the list of roles includes the required roles.
Grant the roles
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Select the project.
Click person_add Grant access .
In the New principals field, enter your user identifier.
This is typically the email address for a Google Account.
Click Select a role , then search for the role.
To grant additional roles, click add Add
another role and add each additional role.
Click Save .
Configure networking
The following sections explain how to create a network and a subnet to host the
endpoint, and how to create a firewall rule to allow SSH access to the client VM
used for testing the endpoint.
Create a network and subnet
To create the service consumer network and subnet, follow these steps.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks page.
Go to VPC networks
Click Create VPC network .
For Name , enter consumer-network .
For Subnet creation mode , select Custom .
In the New subnet section, enter the following information.
For Name , enter consumer-subnet .
For Region , select the same region as the published service that you
created.
For IP stack type , select IPv4 (single-stack) .
For IPv4 range , enter 192.168.10.0/24 .
Click Done .
Click Create .
gcloud
Create a custom mode VPC network:
gcloud compute networks create consumer-network --subnet-mode=custom
In the consumer-network network, create a subnet.
gcloud compute networks subnets create consumer-subnet \
--network=consumer-network \
--range=192.168.10.0/24 \
--region= REGION
Replace REGION with the same region as the published service that you
created.
Configure firewall rules
Create a firewall rule called fw-allow-ssh to let SSH traffic from
0.0.0.0/0 reach VMs that have the allow-ssh network tag.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Firewall policies page.
Go to Firewall policies
To allow incoming SSH connections, click Create firewall rule and
use the following settings:
For Name , enter fw-allow-ssh .
For Network , select consumer-network .
For Priority , enter 1000 .
For Direction of traffic , select Ingress .
For Action on match , select Allow .
For Targets , select Specified target tags .
For Target tags , enter allow-ssh .
For Source filter , select IPv4 ranges .
For Source IPv4 ranges , enter 0.0.0.0/0 .
For Protocols and ports , select Specified protocols and ports ,
select the TCP checkbox. For Ports , enter 22 .
Click Create .
gcloud
Create the fw-allow-ssh firewall rule to allow SSH connectivity to
VMs with the network tag allow-ssh .
gcloud compute firewall-rules create fw-allow-ssh \
--network=consumer-network \
--action=allow \
--direction=ingress \
--source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
--target-tags=allow-ssh \
--rules=tcp:22
Create an endpoint
Create an endpoint that points to the published service that you created.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Private Service Connect page.
Go to Private Service Connect
Click the Connected endpoints tab.
Click Connect endpoint .
For Target , select Published service .
For Target service , enter
projects/ PRODUCER_PROJECT /regions/ REGION /serviceAttachments/published-service .
Replace PRODUCER_PROJECT with the project ID of the published
service. Replace REGION with the region of the published service.
For Endpoint name , enter ep-1 .
For Network , select consumer-network .
For Subnetwork , select consumer-subnet .
Click the IP address drop-down menu and select Create IP address .
For Name , enter ep-ip-1 .
For Static IP address , select Let me choose .
For Custom IP address , enter 192.168.10.5 .
Click Reserve .
Click Add endpoint .
gcloud
Reserve an internal IP address to assign to the endpoint.
gcloud compute addresses create ep-ip-1 \
--region= REGION \
--subnet=consumer-subnet \
--addresses=192.168.10.5
Replace REGION with the same region as the published service that you
created.
Create a forwarding rule to connect the endpoint to the service
producer's service attachment.
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create ep-1 \
--region= REGION \
--network=consumer-network \
--address=ep-ip-1 \
--target-service-attachment=projects/ PRODUCER_PROJECT /regions/ REGION /serviceAttachments/published-service
Replace the following:
PRODUCER_PROJECT : the project ID of the service producer project.
REGION : the region of the service attachment.
Test accessing the endpoint
To test that the endpoint and the published service are working, create a test
VM and send a request from it to the endpoint.
Create a client VM for testing
Create a client VM in the same region as the endpoint.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Click Create instance .
For Name , enter consumer-test .
For Region , select the same region as the backend VMs.
For Zone , select a zone in that region.
Click Networking and configure the following fields:
For Network tags , enter allow-ssh .
For Network interfaces , select the following:
For Network , select consumer-network
For Subnet , select consumer-subnet
Click Create .
gcloud
gcloud compute instances create consumer-test \
--zone= ZONE \
--image-family=debian-12 \
--image-project=debian-cloud \
--tags=allow-ssh \
--subnet=consumer-subnet
Replace ZONE with a zone that's in the same
region as the backend VMs.
Test connectivity
This test contacts the endpoint from a client VM. The expected behavior is
for traffic to be distributed across the load balancer's backend VMs.
Connect to the client VM instance.
gcloud compute ssh consumer-test --zone= ZONE
Replace ZONE with the zone of the client VM.
Make a web request to the endpoint using curl to contact its IP
address. Repeat the request so you can see that responses come from
different backend VMs. The name of the VM generating the response is
displayed in the text in the HTML response, because of the contents of
/var/www/html/index.html on each backend VM. For example, expected
responses look like Page served from: vm-1 and Page served from:
vm-2 .
curl -s http://192.168.10.5
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the projects
Delete both the producer project ( PRODUCER_PROJECT ) and the consumer
project ( CONSUMER_PROJECT ).
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
