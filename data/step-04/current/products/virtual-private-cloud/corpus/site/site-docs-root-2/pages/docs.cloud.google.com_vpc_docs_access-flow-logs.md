Access flow logs
This page describes how to access flow logs by using Cloud Logging.
Access flow logs in the Logs Explorer
VPC Flow Logs writes logs to the Google Cloud project of the log
reporter. You can view flow logs in the
Logs Explorer .
VPC Flow Logs uses the following logs to collect log entries:
The networkmanagement.googleapis.com/vpc_flows log collects
log entries for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, subnets, VLAN attachments
for Cloud Interconnect, and Cloud VPN tunnels.
The compute.googleapis.com/vpc_flows log collects log entries for
subnets. This log is generated only if you
enabled VPC Flow Logs for subnets by using the Compute Engine API .
Configure IAM
To configure access control for logging, see the
access control guide for Logging .
View flow logs by using resource filters
To view flow logs in a Google Cloud project by using resource filters, see the
following sections. You can also view these logs by using Logs Explorer
queries, as described in

Filter flow logs by using queries
To view flow logs in a Google Cloud project by using Logs Explorer
queries, do the following.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Logs Explorer page.
Go to Logs Explorer
If you don't see the query editor field in the Query pane, click the
Show query toggle.
In the query editor field, enter a query:
For example, to view flow logs for a specific source Cloud VPN
tunnel, enter the following query:
resource.type="vpc_flow_logs_config"
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/networkmanagement.googleapis.com%2Fvpc_flows"
jsonPayload.reporter="SRC_GATEWAY"
labels.target_resource_name="projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /regions/ REGION /vpnTunnels/ NAME "
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID of
the Cloud VPN tunnel
PROJECT_NUMBER : the project number of the
Cloud VPN tunnel
REGION : the region of the Cloud VPN tunnel
NAME : the name of the Cloud VPN tunnel
If you
enabled
VPC Flow Logs for a subnet by using the Compute Engine API,
the query must target compute.googleapis.com .
For example, enter the following query, replacing
PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project ID and
SUBNET_NAME with your subnet:
resource.type="gce_subnetwork"
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fvpc_flows"
resource.labels.subnetwork_name=" SUBNET_NAME "
For more examples of queries that you can run to view your flow logs, see
Examples of Logs Explorer queries for VPC Flow Logs .
Click Run query .
Examples of Logs Explorer queries for VPC Flow Logs
This section provides examples of Logs Explorer queries that you
can run to view your flow logs. Include the following information in all
queries:
Specify the resource type and log name of the log that you want to query, as
described in the following table. You can query both logs in a single query.
Log
Resource type and log name
networkmanagement.googleapis.com/vpc_flows
Collects logs for configurations that are managed by the
Network Management API.
resource.type="vpc_flow_logs_config"
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/networkmanagement.googleapis.com%2Fvpc_flows"
compute.googleapis.com/vpc_flows
Collects logs for configurations that are managed by the Compute Engine API.
resource.type="gce_subnetwork"
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fvpc_flows"
Replace PROJECT_ID with the Google Cloud project ID of
the reporting resource.
If you use multiple VPC Flow Logs configurations per resource,
specify the name of the configuration that you want to query and the
target resource by adding the
resource.labels.name and labels.target_resource_name fields to the
query. This ensures duplicate logs are excluded from the query results.
For more information, see Duplicate logs .
resource.labels.name is the name of the configuration. You can specify
multiple configurations per query.
labels.target_resource_name is the name of the
reporting VPC network, subnet, VLAN attachment, or
Cloud VPN tunnel. Configurations for organizations don't set a
target resource.
These fields are available only in the
networkmanagement.googleapis.com/vpc_flows log.
See the following table for examples of Logs Explorer queries that
you can use to view your flow logs.

Route logs to BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and custom targets
You can route flow logs from Logging to a destination
of your choice as described in the
Routing and storage overview in the Logging
documentation.
Refer to the previous section for example filters.
Troubleshooting
No vpc_flows appear in Logging for the gce_subnetwork resource
Confirm that logging is
enabled for the given
subnet.
VPC flows are only supported for VPC networks.
If you have a legacy network , you don't see any logs.
In Shared VPC networks, logs only appear in
the host project, not the service projects. Make sure that you look for the
logs in the host project.
Logging exclusion filters block specified logs.
Make sure that there are no exclusion rules that discard VPC Flow Logs:
Go to Log router .
In the more_vert More actions
menu for your logging bucket, click View sink details .
Make sure that there are no exclusion rules that might discard VPC Flow Logs.
Use the Google Cloud CLI or API to determine if a log
filtering configuration is
filtering all the traffic in a given subnet. For example, if filterExpr
is set to false , you don't see any logs.
No RTT or byte values on some of the logs
RTT measurements may be missing if not enough packets were sampled to
capture RTT. This is more likely to happen for low volume connections.
RTT values are available only for TCP flows reported from VMs.
Some packets are sent with no payload. If header-only packets are sampled,
the bytes value is usually zero. For more information, see
Record format .
Some flows are missing
Ingress packets are sampled after ingress
VPC firewall rules . Make sure that
there aren't any ingress firewall rules that deny the packets that you expect
to be logged. If you're not sure whether VPC
firewall rules are blocking ingress packets, you can enable
Firewall Rules Logging and
inspect the logs.
Only TCP, UDP, ICMP, ESP, and GRE protocols are supported. VPC Flow Logs
does not support any other protocols.
Logs are sampled . Some packets in very
low volume flows might be missed.
Missing GKE annotations in some logs
Make sure that your GKE cluster is a supported version .
Missing logs for some GKE flows
Make sure Intranode
visibility is enabled in
the cluster. Otherwise, flows between Pods on the same node are not logged.
Duplicate logs
Each VPC Flow Logs configuration generates a separate set of logs.
If your logging information contains duplicate logs,
check if the reporting resource is associated with more than one configuration.
A resource is associated with more than one configuration if you
create multiple configurations per resource or if you create
multiple configurations and their scopes overlap as described in the following
list:
VPC Flow Logs is configured for the organization, and
you have additional configurations for the organization or
VPC networks, subnets, VLAN attachments, or
Cloud VPN tunnels in any of the organization's projects.
By default, a VPC Flow Logs configuration for
an organization generates logs for all VM instances in all subnets, all
VLAN attachments, and all Cloud VPN tunnels in the
organization. If you create additional configurations, each additional
configuration generates its own set of logs.
VPC Flow Logs is configured for a VPC network,
and you have additional configurations for subnets, VLAN attachments, or
Cloud VPN tunnels in the same network.
By default, a VPC Flow Logs configuration for a
VPC network generates logs for all VM
instances in all subnets, all VLAN attachments, and all Cloud VPN
tunnels in the network. If you create additional
configurations, each additional configuration generates its own set of logs.
VPC Flow Logs is configured for a subnet through both the
Network Management API and the Compute Engine API. Both the
Compute Engine API-managed VPC Flow Logs configuration for
the subnet and each applicable configuration that you create
by using the Network Management API to generate logs.
For more information about which resources are logged by each
VPC Flow Logs configuration scope, see
Supported configurations .
To view your VPC Flow Logs configurations, see
View VPC Flow Logs configurations (all) .
To filter out duplicate logs when viewing them, you can use the following
fields:
To filter logs by log name, specify the resource_type and log_name fields.
To filter logs by configuration and target resource name, specify the
resource.labels.name and labels.target_resource_name fields.
For more information about these fields and how to use them, see
Examples of Logs Explorer queries for VPC Flow Logs .
