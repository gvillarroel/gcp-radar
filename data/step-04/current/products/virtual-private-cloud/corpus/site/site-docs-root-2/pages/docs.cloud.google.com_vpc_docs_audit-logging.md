Virtual Private Cloud audit logging
This document describes audit logging for Virtual Private Cloud. Google Cloud services
generate audit logs that record administrative and access activities within your Google Cloud resources.
For more information about Cloud Audit Logs, see the following:
Types of audit logs
Audit log entry structure
Storing and routing audit logs
Cloud Logging pricing summary
Enable Data Access audit logs
Notes
The following methods that start with google.cloud.networkconnectivity.v1.PolicyBasedRoutingService use the service name networkconnectivity.googleapis.com .
Service name
Virtual Private Cloud audit logs use the service name compute.googleapis.com .
Filter for this service:
protoPayload . serviceName = "compute.googleapis.com"
Methods by permission type
For the following API methods, there is also a beta and
alpha version available that is not listed here. When the
beta or alpha version of the API is called the method name will start
with beta or alpha respectively.
Each IAM permission has a type property, whose value is an enum
that can be one of four values: ADMIN_READ , ADMIN_WRITE ,
DATA_READ , or DATA_WRITE . When you call a method,
Virtual Private Cloud generates an audit log whose category is dependent on the
type property of the permission required to perform the method.
Methods that require an IAM permission with the type property value
of DATA_READ , DATA_WRITE , or ADMIN_READ generate
Data Access audit logs.
Methods that require an IAM permission with the type property value
of ADMIN_WRITE generate
Admin Activity audit logs.
