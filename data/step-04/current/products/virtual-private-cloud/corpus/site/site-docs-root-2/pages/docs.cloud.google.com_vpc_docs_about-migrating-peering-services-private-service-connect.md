About migrating peering-based services to Private Service Connect
Many managed service producers use
VPC Network Peering to offer connectivity to
service consumers that are in another Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. An
alternative solution is to use Private Service Connect.
This document provides an overview of how service producers can migrate their
peering-based services to
Private Service Connect
and preserve the IPv4 addresses that are used to access the services. This
migration process requires that all resources that are connected to a given
subnet must be migrated at the same time.
Each service producer determines whether and when they are going to migrate to
Private Service Connect. To learn whether a service producer is
migrating from VPC Network Peering to
Private Service Connect, check the service documentation or
contact the service producer.
Migrating peering-based services
In this example peering-based service, the client vm1 sends traffic to the
service's load balancer 10.10.10.10 in the producer VPC
network. The consumer network has a peering subnet
route for the producer subnet because
the networks are connected through VPC Network Peering.
Figure 1. In a peering-based service, the consumer
VPC network and the producer VPC network can
access each other through VPC Network Peering (click to enlarge).
During the migration, the following tasks are completed:
The producer deploys the service in a new subnet producer-subnet-2 in a
new VPC network, and publishes the service through
Private Service Connect.
The producer creates an internal range to reserve the CIDR range of the
producer subnet, 10.10.10.0/24 .
The producer deletes the original subnet producer-subnet-1 and all
resources in it.
A migration subnet consumer-subnet-2 is created in the consumer
VPC network, configured with the same CIDR range as the
producer subnet.
A Private Service Connect endpoint is created in the
migration subnet, configured with the same IP address that was previously
used by the producer load balancer forwarding rule.
After the migration is completed, the client vm1 can still reach the service
at 10.10.10.10 , but this IP address is now associated with the
Private Service Connect endpoint in the consumer
VPC network.
Figure 2. After the migration, clients in the consumer
VPC network send requests to the Private Service Connect
endpoint, which forwards traffic to the producer VPC network (click to enlarge).
Migration tasks
The migration includes tasks that are performed in both the producer and
consumer VPC networks. The producer can coordinate with the
consumer to perform the migration, or in the case of Google-managed services,
the service producer can automate the consumer tasks through a service
agent .

If it's not needed for other services, delete the peering connection in
the producer and consumer networks

Considerations
If you are a service producer who wants to migrate your peering-based service
to Private Service Connect, consider the following:
The Private Service Connect implementation of the service
must offer the same features as the peering-based service.
The migration process supports preserving IPv4 addresses that access
services. Preserving IPv6 addresses isn't supported. However, migrated
services can be accessed by IPv6 Private Service Connect
endpoints.
You must be able to delete all resources in the subnet that contains the
service instance during the migration. If multiple service instances use the
same subnet, all instances must migrate at the same time.
The consumer's Private Service Connect endpoint and the
producer's service attachment and forwarding rule must all be in the same
region.
To let the endpoint be accessed from any region, you can enable global
access on the endpoint .
If the service saves state, you must have a method of migrating the state to
the new service instances.
You can't delete the peering connection until all service instances in the
producer VPC network have migrated.
The service has a downtime during the migration.
Migrating to Private Service Connect has a pricing impact for
both producers and consumers. Make sure that your consumers are aware of
this change before you migrate them.
Private Service Connect translates the source IP address of
the client to an IP address in a NAT
subnet . If the service
needs IP address information about the client, you must use PROXY
protocol to get the
client IP address, and handle the packets appropriately between the backend
VMs and your application.
Internal ranges for migration
The internal range is used to reserve the CIDR
range that is used in the producer subnet so that when the producer subnet is
deleted, the CIDR range can't be used for another purpose.
When you create an internal range for peer migration, you set the usage to
FOR_MIGRATION and specify the source and target subnets. The source subnet is
the producer subnet, and the target subnet is the new peer migration subnet that
will later be created in the consumer network.
Creating the internal range prevents a subnet from being created that matches
both the target subnet name, and the CIDR range. However, another subnet can be
created in the consumer network that has the same name if it uses a different
CIDR range. If that happens, the migration can't proceed until either the
consumer subnet with the matching name is deleted, or the internal range is
deleted.
Peer migration subnets
The subnet that is created in the consumer network for migration has the purpose
set to PEER_MIGRATION . Peer migration subnets can contain only IP addresses
and Private Service Connect endpoints.
After the migration is complete and verified, the subnet is updated to become a
regular subnet by setting the purpose to PRIVATE , and other resources can be
created in the subnet. A regular subnet can't be converted back to a peer
migration subnet.
Only principals that have the compute.subnetworks.usePeerMigration permission can
do the following:
Create and delete IP address resources in peer migration subnets.
Create and delete Private Service Connect endpoints
(forwarding rules) in peer migration subnets.
The compute.subnetworks.usePeerMigration permission is included in the
following roles:
Compute Peer Subnet Migration
Admin
( roles/compute.peerSubnetMigrationAdmin )
Compute Network Admin
( roles/compute.networkAdmin )
Principals with the Compute Peer Subnet Migration Admin role can create and
delete IP addresses and Private Service Connect endpoints in a
peer migration subnet, but they can't create, update, or delete the migration
subnet.
Principals that have the Compute Network Admin role can perform all the tasks
necessary for migration, including the preceding tasks and also the following:
Create a subnet with the purpose set to PEER_MIGRATION .
Update the subnet—for example, to expand the CIDR range or enable
Private Google Access.
Update the subnet purpose to PRIVATE .
Delete the subnet.
Pricing
For pricing information, see the following:
Service producers: pricing for publishing a
service .
Service consumers: pricing for accessing a published service through an
endpoint .
