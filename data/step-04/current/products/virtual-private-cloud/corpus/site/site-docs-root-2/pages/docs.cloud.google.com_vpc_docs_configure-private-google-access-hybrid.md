Configure Private Google Access for on-premises hosts
Private Google Access for on-premises hosts provides a way for on-premises
systems to connect to Google APIs and
services by routing traffic
through a Cloud VPN tunnel or a VLAN attachment for
Cloud Interconnect .
Private Google Access for on-premises hosts is an alternative to
connecting to Google APIs and services over the internet.
This document describes how to enable Private Google Access for on-premises
hosts.
Note: These instructions also apply to host machines in a
Bare Metal Solution region extension. Except in reference to
name servers in the DNS configuration
section, the term on-premises in these instructions is equivalent
to Bare Metal Solution . For DNS name servers, the DNS name server that you
use can be your own enterprise server in your actual on-premises environment,
a DNS name server on Google Cloud, or, if you enable
your Bare Metal Solution machines to connect to the internet, a public DNS
name server.
Specifications and requirements
Private Google Access for on-premises hosts has the following requirements:
You must direct Google APIs and services traffic sent by on-premises systems
to the IP addresses associated with either the private.googleapis.com or the
restricted.googleapis.com special domain names. For details about what services can be
accessed on each domain, see Domain options .
Your on-premises network must be connected to a VPC
network by using either Cloud VPN tunnels or
VLAN attachments.
The VPC network to which your on-premises network is connected
must have appropriate routes for either the private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com destination IP ranges. For details, see
VPC network routing .
The VPC network to which your on-premises network is connected
must have appropriate routes to reach the on-premises network. The next hop
Cloud VPN tunnels or VLAN attachments that
connect to your on-premises network for these routes must be within the same region
where the request originated. If the next hop is in a region different from where
the request to Private Google Access originated, response from
Private Google Access will not reach the on-premises network.
Your on-premises network must have routes for either the
private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com destination IP ranges.
These routes must direct traffic to the appropriate Cloud VPN tunnel
or VLAN attachment that connects to your
VPC network. For details, see on-premises routing with
Cloud Router .
To let IPv6 clients in your on-premises environment access Google APIs by using
private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com , you must configure the connection to your VPC
network to support IPv6. For more information, see the following pages:
IPv6 support for
HA VPN
IP protocols support for
Cloud Router
On-premises clients can send requests from any IPv6 GUA or ULA addresses, except for the ULA range
fda3:e722:ac3:cc00::/64 , which is reserved for internal use.
If your project is providing access to Google APIs for on-premises hosts
only, you don't need to enable the Google APIs for the project.
However, if resources within the project need to access Google APIs, you
might need to separately
enable the APIs for
the services that they need to access. For more information about using
Private Google Access for resources within a project, see Configure
Private Google Access .
Permissions
Project owners, editors, and IAM principals with the Network
Admin role can create or update
subnets and assign IP addresses.
For more information about roles, read the
IAM roles documentation.
Network configuration
Private Google Access for on-premises hosts has specific network
requirements for on-premises systems and for the VPC
network through which the on-premises systems send traffic to Google APIs and
services.
Domain options
Private Google Access for on-premises hosts requires that you direct services
to one of the following special domains. The special domain you choose
determines which services you can access.
The private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com VIPs support
only HTTP-based protocols over TCP (HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2). All other protocols, including MQTT
and ICMP, are not supported.
Domain and IP address ranges

packages.cloud.google.com
pkg.dev or *.pkg.dev
pki.goog or *.pki.goog
*.run.app
source.developers.google.com
storage.cloud.google.com
Use private.googleapis.com to access Google APIs and services
using a set of IP addresses only routable from within Google Cloud.
Choose private.googleapis.com under these circumstances:
You don't use VPC Service Controls.
You do use VPC Service Controls, but you also need to access Google APIs
and services that are not supported by VPC Service Controls.
1
restricted.googleapis.com
199.36.153.4/30
2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Enables API access to
Google APIs and
services that are supported by VPC Service Controls .
Blocks access to Google APIs and services that do not support
VPC Service Controls .
Does not support Google Workspace APIs or Google Workspace web applications such
as Gmail and Google Docs.
Use restricted.googleapis.com to access Google APIs and services
using a set of IP addresses only routable from within Google Cloud.
Choose restricted.googleapis.com when you only
need access to Google APIs and services that are supported by
VPC Service Controls.
The restricted.googleapis.com domain does not permit
access to Google APIs and services that do not support VPC Service Controls.
1
1
If you need to restrict users to just the Google APIs and services
that support VPC Service Controls , use
restricted.googleapis.com , as it provides additional risk mitigation for data
exfiltration. Using restricted.googleapis.com denies access to
Google APIs and services that are not supported by VPC Service Controls. See
Setting up private
connectivity in the VPC Service Controls documentation for more details.
IPv6 support for private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com
The following IPv6 address ranges can be used to direct traffic from IPv6
clients to Google APIs and services:
private.googleapis.com : 2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56
restricted.googleapis.com : 2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Consider configuring the IPv6 addresses if you want to use the private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com domain, and you
have clients that use IPv6 addresses. IPv6 clients that also have IPv4 addresses configured can
reach Google APIs and services by using the IPv4 addresses. Not all services accept traffic from
IPv6 clients.
DNS configuration
Your on-premises network must have DNS zones and records configured so that the
domain names of the services that you're accessing resolve to the set of IP
addresses for either private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com . You
can create Cloud DNS managed private zones and use a Cloud DNS
inbound server policy, or you can configure on-premises name servers. For
example, you can use BIND or Microsoft
Active Directory
DNS .
The following sections describe how to use DNS zones to send packets to the IP
addresses that are associated with your chosen VIP. Follow the instructions for
all scenarios that apply to you:
If you use services that have *.googleapis.com domain names, see
Configure DNS for googleapis.com .
If you use services that have other domain names , see
Configure DNS for other domains . For
example, if you use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you also need to
configure *.gcr.io and *.pkg.dev , or if you use
Cloud Run, you need to configure *.run.app .
If you use Cloud Storage buckets, and you send requests to a
Cloud Storage custom domain name, see Configure DNS for
Cloud Storage custom domain
names .
If you implement the DNS configuration using Cloud DNS, see
Configure DNS for on-premises systems .
When you configure DNS records for the VIPs, use only the IP addresses that are
described in the following steps. Do not mix addresses from the
private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com VIPs. This can
cause intermittent failures because the services that are offered differ
based on a packet's destination.
Note: There are public DNS records for private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com. However, you can't use the public records to access
Google APIs. You must create a private DNS zone and records.
Configure DNS for googleapis.com
Create a DNS zone and records for googleapis.com :
Create a private DNS zone for googleapis.com . Consider creating a
Cloud DNS private zone for this
purpose.
In the googleapis.com zone, create the following private DNS records for either
private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com , depending on which
domain you've chosen to use.
For private.googleapis.com :
Create an A record for private.googleapis.com pointing to the
following IP addresses: 199.36.153.8 , 199.36.153.9 , 199.36.153.10 , 199.36.153.11 .
To connect to APIs using IPv6 addresses, also configure an AAAA
record for private.googleapis.com pointing to 2600:2d00:0002:2000:: .
For restricted.googleapis.com :
Create an A record for restricted.googleapis.com pointing to the
following IP addresses: 199.36.153.4 , 199.36.153.5 , 199.36.153.6 , 199.36.153.7 .
To connect to APIs using IPv6 addresses, also create an AAAA
record for restricted.googleapis.com pointing to
2600:2d00:0002:1000:: .
To create private DNS records in Cloud DNS, see
add a record .
In the googleapis.com zone, create a CNAME record for *.googleapis.com
that points to the domain that you've configured: private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com .
Configure DNS for other domains
Some Google APIs and services are provided using additional domain names,
including *.gcr.io , *.gstatic.com , *.pkg.dev , pki.goog , *.run.app , and *.gke.goog .
Refer to the domain and IP address ranges table in Domain options
to determine if the additional domain's services can be accessed using private.googleapis.com
or restricted.googleapis.com . Then, for each of the additional domains:
Create a DNS zone for DOMAIN (for example, gcr.io ).
If you're using Cloud DNS, make sure this zone is located in the
same project as your googleapis.com private zone.
In this DNS zone, create the following private DNS records for either
private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com , depending on which
domain you've chosen to use.
For private.googleapis.com :
Create an A record for DOMAIN pointing to the following
IP addresses: 199.36.153.8 , 199.36.153.9 , 199.36.153.10 , 199.36.153.11 .
To connect to APIs using IPv6 addresses, also create an AAAA
record for DOMAIN pointing to 2600:2d00:0002:2000:: .
For restricted.googleapis.com :
Create an A record for DOMAIN pointing to the following
IP addresses: 199.36.153.4 , 199.36.153.5 , 199.36.153.6 , 199.36.153.7 .
To connect to APIs using IPv6 addresses, also create an AAAA
record for DOMAIN pointing to
2600:2d00:0002:1000:: .
In the DOMAIN zone, create a CNAME record for
*. DOMAIN that points to DOMAIN .
For example, create a CNAME record for *.gcr.io that points to
gcr.io .
Configure DNS for Cloud Storage custom domain names
If you are using Cloud Storage buckets, and you send requests to a
Cloud Storage custom domain name ,
configuring DNS records for the custom Cloud Storage domain name to point to
the IP addresses for private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com is
not sufficient to allow access to the Cloud Storage buckets.
If you want to send requests to a Cloud Storage custom domain name, you must also explicitly
set the HTTP request's Host header and TLS SNI to storage.googleapis.com The
IP addresses for private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com do not
support custom Cloud Storage hostnames in HTTP request Host headers and TLS
SNIs.
Configure DNS for on-premises systems
If you've implemented the DNS configuration using Cloud DNS, you'll
need to configure on-premises systems so that they can make queries to your
Cloud DNS managed private zones:
Create an inbound server policy in the
VPC network to which your on-premises network connects.
Identify the inbound forwarder entry
points , in the region(s) where your
Cloud VPN tunnels and VLAN attachments
are located, in the VPC network to which your on-premises
network connects.
Configure on-premises systems and on-premises DNS name servers to forward
googleapis.com and any of the additional domain names to an inbound
forwarder entry point in the same region as the Cloud VPN
tunnel or VLAN attachment that connects to the
VPC network .
VPC network routing
The VPC network to which your on-premises network connects must
have routes for the IP address ranges used by private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com . These routes must use the default internet gateway
next hop.
Google Cloud doesn't publish routes on the internet for the IP address
ranges used by the private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com domains.
Consequently, even though the routes in the VPC network send
traffic to the default internet gateway next hop, packets sent to those IP
address ranges remain within Google's network.
If the VPC network to which your on-premises network connects
contains a default route whose next hop
is the default internet gateway, that route meets the routing requirements for
Private Google Access for on-premises hosts.
VPC network custom routing
If you've replaced or changed your default route, ensure that you have custom
static routes configured for the destination IP ranges used by
private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com . To check the
configuration of custom routes for Google APIs and services in a given network,
follow these directions.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Routes page.
Go to Routes
Use the Filter table text field to filter the list of routes using
the following criteria, replacing NETWORK_NAME with the name
of the VPC network to which your on-premises network
connects:
Network: NETWORK_NAME
Next hop type: default internet gateway
Look at the Destination IP range column for each route. Look for a
route whose destination range matches:
199.36.153.8/30 if you chose private.googleapis.com
199.36.153.4/30 if you chose restricted.googleapis.com
gcloud
Use the following gcloud command, replacing NETWORK_NAME with
the name of the VPC network to which your on-premises network
connects:
gcloud compute routes list \
--filter="default-internet-gateway NETWORK_NAME "
Routes are listed in table format unless you customize the command with the
--format flag. Look in the DEST_RANGE column for a route whose
destination range matches:
199.36.153.8/30 if you chose private.googleapis.com
199.36.153.4/30 if you chose restricted.googleapis.com
If you need to create routes in your VPC network, see Adding a
static route .
On-premises routing with Cloud Router
Routes in your on-premises network must be configured to direct traffic for the
IP address ranges used by the private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com domains to the next hop Cloud VPN tunnels
or VLAN attachments that connect to your VPC network.
You can use Cloud Router Custom Route
Advertisements
to announce routes for the IP ranges used by the
private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com domains.
IPv6 routes are advertised only in BGP sessions where
IPv6 is enabled .
Important: IP address ranges for private.googleapis.com and
restricted.googleapis.com are not routable on the internet.
Console
To update the route advertisement mode for all BGP sessions on a
Cloud Router, except for those BGP sessions that use custom BGP
advertisements themselves:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Router page.
Go to Cloud Router
Select the Cloud Router that manages BGP sessions for the
Cloud VPN tunnels or VLAN attachments
that connect your on-premises network to your VPC
network.
In the Cloud Router's detail page, select Edit .
Expand the Advertised routes section.
For the Routes , select Create custom routes .
If you want to advertise all subnet routes available to the
Cloud Router, select
Advertise all subnets visible to the Cloud Router . This
setting replicates the default configuration to your custom configuration.
For each advertised route that you want to add, do the following:
Select Add custom route .
For Source , select Custom IP range .
For IP address range , enter one of the ranges that you want to use:
If you use private.googleapis.com :
For IPv4 connectivity: 199.36.153.8/30
For IPv6 connectivity: 2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56
If you use restricted.googleapis.com :
For IPv4 connectivity: 199.36.153.4/30
For IPv6 connectivity: 2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Click Done .
After you're done adding routes, select Save .
To update the route advertisement mode for a particular BGP session:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Router page.
Go to Cloud Router
Select the Cloud Router that manages the BGP session for a
Cloud VPN tunnel or VLAN attachment
that connects your on-premises network to your VPC
network.
In the Cloud Router's detail page, select the BGP session to
update.
In the BGP session details page, click Edit .
For the Routes , select Create custom routes .
Select Advertise all subnets visible to the Cloud Router to
advertise all subnet routes available to the Cloud Router if you
desire the Cloud Router's default behavior.
For each advertised route that you want to add, do the following:
Select Add custom route .
For Source , select Custom IP range .
For IP address range , enter one of the ranges that you want to use:
If you use private.googleapis.com :
For IPv4 connectivity: 199.36.153.8/30
For IPv6 connectivity: 2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56
If you use restricted.googleapis.com :
For IPv4 connectivity: 199.36.153.4/30
For IPv6 connectivity: 2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Click Done .
After you're done adding routes, select Save .
gcloud
Identify the name and region of the Cloud Router that manages
BGP sessions on the Cloud VPN tunnels or
VLAN attachments that connect your
on-premises network to your VPC network.
Use compute routers
update to update the
route advertisement mode on all the Cloud Router's BGP sessions,
except for those BGP sessions that use custom BGP advertisements
themselves:
gcloud compute routers update ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--advertisement-mode=CUSTOM \
--set-advertisement-groups=ALL_SUBNETS \
--set-advertisement-ranges= CUSTOM_RANGES
You can append new advertisement ranges if you're already using the
CUSTOM advertisement mode for the Cloud Router. This updates
the route advertisement mode on all the Cloud Router's BGP
sessions, except for those BGP sessions that use custom BGP
advertisements themselves:
gcloud compute routers update ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--add-advertisement-ranges= CUSTOM_RANGES
Alternatively, use compute routers
update-bgp-peer
to configure a specific BGP peer on the Cloud Router:
If you are adding IPv6 custom ranges, and if IPv6 traffic is disabled for
the BGP session, you can enable it with the --enable-ipv6 flag.
gcloud compute routers update-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME \
--advertisement-mode=CUSTOM \
--set-advertisement-groups=ALL_SUBNETS \
--set-advertisement-ranges= CUSTOM_RANGES
You can append new advertisement ranges if you're already using the
CUSTOM advertisement mode for a BGP session on a Cloud Router
If you are adding IPv6 custom ranges, and if IPv6 traffic is disabled for
the BGP session, you can enable it with the --enable-ipv6 flag.
gcloud compute routers update-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME \
--add-advertisement-ranges= CUSTOM_RANGES
In the commands above, replace the following with valid values:
ROUTER_NAME : The name of the Cloud Router
REGION : The region of the Cloud Router
PEER_NAME : The name of the BGP peer configured when you
create a VLAN attachment for
Dedicated Interconnect , when
you create a VLAN attachment for
Partner Interconnect , or when you create an
HA VPN
tunnel
Leave --set-advertisement-groups=ALL_SUBNETS in order to advertise
all subnet routes available to the Cloud Router. This is the
Cloud Router's default behavior.
CUSTOM_RANGES : A comma-delimited list of custom ranges to
advertise.
For private.googleapis.com :
For IPv4 connectivity: 199.36.153.8/30
For both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity: 199.36.153.8/30,2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56
For restricted.googleapis.com :
For IPv4 connectivity: 199.36.153.4/30
For both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity: 199.36.153.4/30,2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Firewall considerations
Google Cloud firewall rules in the VPC network to which
your on-premises network connects have no effect upon:
Packets sent through a Cloud VPN tunnel connected to the
VPC network
Packets sent through a VLAN attachment connected
to the VPC network
Incoming packets to Cloud DNS inbound forwarder IP addresses in
the VPC network
You should ensure that the firewall configuration of on-premises systems allows
outbound traffic to and established responses from the appropriate IP addresses:
If you use private.googleapis.com :
For IPv4 connectivity: 199.36.153.8/30
For IPv6 connectivity: 2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56
If you use restricted.googleapis.com :
For IPv4 connectivity: 199.36.153.4/30
For IPv6 connectivity: 2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Any Cloud DNS inbound forwarder IP addresses, if you're using
Cloud DNS for the DNS configuration
