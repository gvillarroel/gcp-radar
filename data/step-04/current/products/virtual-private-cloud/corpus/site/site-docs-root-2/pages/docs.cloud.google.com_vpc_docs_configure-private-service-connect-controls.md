Access regional Google APIs through backends
This guide describes how to configure an internal Application Load Balancer with a
Private Service Connect backend to access a regional Google
API .
For more information about backends, see About
backends .
An internal Application Load Balancer used for Private Service Connect can be
reached from Shared VPC
networks and from
connected networks .
Roles
The Compute Load Balancer Admin
role
( roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin ) contains the permission required to perform
the tasks described in this guide.
Supported services
See the list of supported regional service
endpoints .
Before you begin
Enable
the Compute Engine API in your project.
If you want to register the load balancing forwarding rule with
Service Directory,
enable the
Service Directory API in your
project. To configure Service Directory, you must create the
forwarding rule by using the Google Cloud CLI or the API.
Create a proxy-only subnet
if you don't already have one. There must be a single proxy-only subnet
in the VPC network and region where you intend to create the
internal Application Load Balancer. This subnet is used by all internal Application Load Balancers within that
network and region.
If you don't already have them, create a private key and a self-managed
certificate for your domain. See step 1 of using self-managed SSL
certificates . You
need a private key and certificate to create the
target HTTPS proxy when you configure the load
balancer .
Create a network endpoint group
For each service that you want to make available using the load balancer,
create a Private Service Connect network endpoint group (NEG).
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Network endpoint groups page.
Go to Network endpoint groups
Click Create network endpoint group .
Enter a Name for the network endpoint group.
For the Network endpoint group type , select Network endpoint group
(Private Service Connect) .
Select the Region for the network endpoint group.
Select the Target service for the network endpoint group.
Click Create .
gcloud
gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups create NEG_NAME \
--network-endpoint-type=private-service-connect \
--psc-target-service= TARGET_SERVICE \
--region= REGION
Replace the following:
NEG_NAME : a name for the network endpoint group.
TARGET_SERVICE : the target service that you want to connect
to. See the list of supported regional service
endpoints .
REGION : the region to create the network endpoint group
in. The region must be the same region as the service you want to connect to.
Configure the load balancer
All load balancer components must be created in the same region as the
Private Service Connect network endpoint group.
Console
Select the load balancer type
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load balancing page.
Go to Load balancing
Click Create load balancer .
For Type of load balancer , select Application Load Balancer
(HTTP/HTTPS) and click Next .
For Public facing or internal , select Internal and click
Next .
For Cross-region or single region deployment , select Best for
regional workloads and click Next .
Click Configure .
Basic configuration
Enter a Name for the load balancer.
Select a Region for the load balancer.
Select a Network for the load balancer.
The network must contain a proxy-only subnet in the region that you are
creating the NEG and load balancer in. If you don't have one, you can
click Reserve subnet to create one.
Keep the window open to continue.
Backend configuration
The Private Service Connect network endpoint group is a type
of load balancer backend. You create a backend service for each backend you
want to configure.
Click Backend configuration .
For each Private Service Connect network endpoint group
that you want to configure, create a backend service.
From the Create or select backend services menu, select Create a
backend service .
Enter a Name for the backend service.
Set the Backend type to Private Service Connect network endpoint
group .
Set the Private Service Connect target type to Regional Google
API .
Select HTTPS for the protocol.
In the Backends section, click the New backend menu, and select
the Private Service Connect network endpoint group.
If you need to create a new Private Service Connect
network endpoint group, click Create Private Service Connect network
endpoint group .
Routing rules
The set of rules for routing incoming HTTPS requests to
specific backend services or backend buckets is called a URL map .
To learn more about URL maps, see
URL maps overview .
If you are configuring only one backend service for the load balancer, the
default routing rule is sufficient, and you can skip to Frontend
configuration .
If you have more than one backend service, click Routing rules .
Select Simple host and path rule .
For each backend, do the following:
Add host and path rule .
For Host , enter the hostname that will be used to send requests to
this service—for example, pubsub.example.com .
For Paths , enter the path—for example, /* .
For Backends , select the backend service.
Frontend configuration
Click Frontend configuration .
Click Add frontend IP and port .
Enter a Name for the load balancer.
In the Protocol field, select HTTPS (includes HTTP/2) .
Select a Subnetwork for the load balancer.
Ensure that the Port is set to 443 , to allow HTTPS traffic.
For IP address , select an IP address from the menu.
If you want to reserve a new IP address, click Create IP
address .
Click the Certificate drop-down list.
If you already have a self-managed SSL certificate
resource
that you want to use, select it from the menu.
Otherwise, select Create a new certificate .
Enter a Name for the certificate resource.
In the appropriate fields, upload your PEM-formatted files:
Certificate
Private key
Click Create .
Click Done .
Review and finalize
Click Review and finalize to review the configuration.
Click Create .
gcloud
For each network endpoint group that you have created, create a backend
service.
gcloud compute backend-services create BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL_MANAGED \
--protocol=HTTPS \
--region= REGION
Replace the following:
BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME : the name of the backend service.
REGION : the region to create the backend service in.
For each backend service that you have created, add the corresponding NEG
to the backend service.
gcloud compute backend-services add-backend BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--network-endpoint-group= NEG_NAME \
--region= REGION
Replace the following:
BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME : the name of the backend service.
NEG_NAME : the name of the network endpoint group.
REGION : the region for the backend.
Create a URL map for the load balancer.
A URL map must reference a default backend service. If you're configuring
your load balancer with one backend service, set that backend service as the
default. If you're configuring your load balancer to use multiple backend
services, referenced by host rules and path matchers that you create in the
next step, pick one of the backend services to be the URL map default.
gcloud compute url-maps create URL_MAP_NAME \
--default-service= DEFAULT_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--region= REGION
Replace the following:
URL_MAP_NAME : a name for the URL map.
DEFAULT_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME : the name of the load
balancer's default. The default is used when no host rule matches the
requested hostname.
REGION : the region to create the URL map in.
Add additional backend services to the URL map.
If your URL map needs to reference two or more backend services, complete
the following steps. If your URL map only references one backend service,
skip this step.
For each backend service, add a path matcher. You must create one path
matcher for each backend service.
gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher URL_MAP_NAME \
--path-matcher-name= PATH_MATCHER \
--default-service= BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--region= REGION
Replace the following:
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map.
PATH_MATCHER : a name for the path matcher.
BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME : the name of the backend service.
REGION : the region of the URL map.
For each hostname, add a host rule.
Each host rule can reference only one path matcher, but two or more host
rules can reference the same path matcher.
gcloud compute url-maps add-host-rule URL_MAP_NAME \
--hosts= HOST \
--path-matcher-name= PATH_MATCHER \
--region= REGION
Replace the following:
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map.
HOST : the hostname to send requests to for
this service. For example, pubsub.example.com .
PATH_MATCHER : the name of the path matcher.
REGION : the region of the URL map.
Create the target HTTPS proxy.
Create a regional SSL certificate
resource using the gcloud compute
ssl-certificates create command.
Google-managed certificates aren't supported with internal Application Load Balancers.
gcloud compute ssl-certificates create CERTIFICATE \
--certificate= LB_CERT \
--private-key= LB_PRIVATE_KEY \
--region= REGION
Replace the following:
CERTIFICATE : a name for the certificate.
LB_CERT : the path to the PEM-formatted certificate
file for your self-managed certificate.
LB_PRIVATE_KEY : the path to the PEM-formatted
private key file for your self-managed certificate.
REGION : the region for the certificate.
Use the regional SSL certificate resource to create a target HTTPS proxy
with the gcloud compute target-https-proxies
create
command.
gcloud compute target-https-proxies create PROXY_NAME \
--url-map= URL_MAP_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--ssl-certificates= CERTIFICATE
Replace the following:
PROXY_NAME : a name for the target HTTPS proxy.
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map.
REGION : the region for the certificate resource.
CERTIFICATE : the name of the certificate resource.
Reserve a regional internal IPv4 address for the forwarding rule.
gcloud compute addresses create ADDRESS_NAME \
--ip-version=IPV4 \
--region= REGION \
--subnet= SUBNETWORK
Replace the following:
ADDRESS_NAME : a name for the IP address resource.
REGION : the region to create the IP address in.
SUBNET : the subnet to create the IP address in.
Run this command to view the reserved IP address. After you've created
the load balancer, you can use the IP address to verify the
configuration .
gcloud compute addresses describe ADDRESS_NAME \
--format="get(address)" --region= REGION
Create the forwarding rule.
Create the forwarding rule using the
gcloud compute forwarding-rules
create
command.
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create FWD_RULE \
--load-balancing-scheme=INTERNAL_MANAGED \
--network= NETWORK \
--address= ADDRESS_NAME \
--ports=443 \
--region= REGION \
--target-https-proxy= PROXY_NAME \
--target-https-proxy-region= PROXY_REGION \
[--service-directory-registration= SD_SERVICE_NAME ]
Replace the following:
FWD_RULE : a name for the forwarding rule.
NETWORK : the network to create the forwarding rule
in.
ADDRESS_NAME : the reserved IP address.
REGION : the region for the forwarding rule.
PROXY_NAME : the name of the target HTTPS proxy.
PROXY_REGION : the region of the target HTTPS proxy.
SD_SERVICE_NAME : the URI of the
Service Directory service that you want to register the load
balancer with , in this format:
projects/ PROJECT /locations/ REGION /namespaces/ NAMESPACE_NAME /services/ SERVICE_NAME .
Specifying --service-directory-registration is optional.
Verify the configuration
Create the VM instance.
gcloud compute instances create VM_NAME \
--network= NETWORK \
--image-project=debian-cloud --image-family=debian-12 \
--zone= ZONE
Replace the following:
VM_NAME : a name for the virtual machine.
NETWORK : the network for the VM.
ZONE : the zone for the VM.
Connect to the VM.
gcloud compute ssh VM_NAME --zone= ZONE
Use curl to verify the configuration. This command sets the Host header
and bypasses DNS resolution by specifying a user-defined IP address. You can
omit the port if you are using the default port for the protocol, for example
using port 443 for HTTPS.
If needed, you can skip certificate validation using the -k flag. You might
need to skip validation if you used a self-signed certificate to configure
the target HTTPS proxy, or if the VM does not have the certificate of the
certificate authority that signed your certificate.
curl -iv --resolve HOSTNAME :443: IP_ADDRESS \
'https:// HOSTNAME / RESOURCE_URI '
Replace the following:
HOSTNAME : the hostname that you configured in your
URL map—for example, pubsub.example.com .
IP_ADDRESS : the IP address of your load balancer's
forwarding rule.
RESOURCE_URI : the rest of the URI of the resource
that you want to use for verification. For example, if the load balancer
is forwarding requests to a regional endpoint for Pub/Sub,
you could use rest?version=v1 .
Configure DNS records
Configure DNS records for each host that you added to the URL map, pointing to
the IP address of the forwarding rule. If you're using Cloud DNS to manage
DNS, see Add, modify, and delete records .
Otherwise, configure DNS records on your DNS server.
For example, say you have created the following configurations:
A Private Service Connect NEG that uses target service
pubsub.europe-west3.rep.googleapis.com .
An internal Application Load Balancer that uses that Private Service Connect NEG
as a backend.
A URL map that defines a host rule for pubsub.example.com .
For this configuration to work correctly, you must create a DNS record that
points pubsub.example.com to the IP address of the forwarding rule.
With this configuration, any requests sent to pubsub.example.com are sent
to the load balancer, which forwards the request to pubsub.europe-west3.rep.googleapis.com .
Configure clients to send requests to the backend
To send requests through the backend instead of the public service endpoints,
you must configure clients to send requests to the hostname that you defined in
the load balancer's URL map—for example, pubsub.example.com . See the
documentation for your client or client library for information about
configuring it to use custom endpoints. The following pages include
configuration steps for some common clients:
Python : you can configure api_endpoint in Client
options .
Go : you can configure WithEndpoint in
ClientOptions .
.NET : you can configure
Endpoint in
the client's builder class.
Java : you can configure setEndpoint in the
client's settings class.
gcloud : you can configure api_endpoint_overrides in the
gcloud CLI .
Access the backend from on-premises hosts
If your on-premises network is connected to a VPC network, you
can send traffic to the Private Service Connect backend.
Your on-premises network must be connected to the VPC network
containing your internal Application Load Balancer using Cloud VPN tunnels or
VLAN attachments in the same region as the internal Application Load Balancer.
The on-premises network must have appropriate routes to your internal Application Load Balancer.
Ensure that each Cloud Router managing the BGP session for the
Cloud VPN tunnel or VLAN attachment has
been configured to advertise the primary IP address range of the subnet used by
your internal Application Load Balancer forwarding rule. Cloud Routers advertise subnet
routes by default.
You must configure on-premises systems so that the hostnames in the URL map of
your internal Application Load Balancer resolve to the internal Application Load Balancer forwarding rule IP
address. You can create the DNS records in on-premises name servers or you can
use Cloud DNS.
If you've created the DNS records using Cloud DNS managed private
zones, complete the following steps:
Create an inbound server policy in the
VPC network to which your on-premises network connects.
Identify the
inbound forwarder entry points ,
in the regions where your Cloud VPN tunnels and
VLAN attachments are located, in the VPC network to which
your on-premises network connects.
Configure on-premises DNS name servers to forward DNS requests for the
hostnames in the URL map to a Cloud DNS inbound forwarder entry
point.

Cloud Router, and on-premises hosts, you can connect to
Google APIs and services using regional backends (click to enlarge).
