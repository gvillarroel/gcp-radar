Planning for bring your own IP addresses
Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) lets you provision and use your own public
IPv4 addresses for Google Cloud resources. After the IP addresses are imported,
Google Cloud manages them in the same way as Google-provided IP addresses,
with these exceptions:
The IP addresses are available only to the customer who brought them.
There are no charges for idle or in-use IP addresses.
Planning your deployment
It's important to plan your deployment, because provisioning and deletion
processes require multiple weeks to complete. For more information about the
provisioning timeline and allowed prefix sizes, see
Limitations .
Here are some decisions that should be considered when you plan your deployment:
Who is responsible for administering BYOIP addresses?
This is typically an administrator or group, but is not typically the same users
who manage individual projects. Use IAM roles and permissions to distinguish who
has privileges for the public advertised prefixes and public delegated prefixes
that you plan to provision.
How are prefixes managed?
It is likely that you want to use your BYOIP addresses in different projects.
You can manage prefixes centrally in a project distinct from the ultimate
destinations of the IP addresses. We recommend that you isolate prefix
administration in a project of its own, including its own users and groups with
Public IP Admin permissions. This isolation helps to prevent confusion about
prefix administration and inadvertent or unauthorized use of prefixes. For more
information, see Project architecture .
How are prefixes named? Every BYOIP resource (public advertised prefix,
public delegated prefix, sub-prefix) requires a name, and the name is used to
manage each resource. You assign the name during resource creation, and names
can't be changed without deleting and recreating the resource. For this reason,
we recommend that you create generic names that won't need to change—for
example, pap-203-0-113-0-24 , pdp-203-0-113-0-25 ,
sub-203-0-113-0-28 , where the letters denote the resource type, and the
numbers denote the specific prefix and prefix length.
Where are the IP addresses provisioned?
It's useful to think of the provisioning process as "stocking" IPs into regions
(or the global scope). The provisioning process for stocking IP addresses takes
multiple weeks to complete, so it's useful to plan and deploy public delegated
prefixes long before they are needed.
You don't have to use all IPs in a public delegated prefix immediately. If
you aren't sure where you need them, provision only the public delegated
prefixes that you're certain you need to use. Moving a public delegated
prefix requires complete deletion and then recreation, which can take
approximately eight weeks.
After public delegated prefix provisioning is complete, you can delegate
sub-prefixes to projects and create addresses for use with resources. If you
anticipate needing BYOIP addresses in a region, complete the public
delegated prefix provisioning process in advance, so you can later fulfill
addressing needs on-demand.
For example, if you need some IP addresses in us-central1 and some IP
addresses for global load balancers, and you want to reserve some IP
addresses for the future, you should create the following plan.
Prefix type
Prefix
Scope
Public advertised prefix
203.0.113.0/24
Public delegated prefix
203.0.113.0/28
us-central1
Public delegated prefix
203.0.113.16/28
us-east-4
Public advertised prefix for global load balancers
192.0.2.0/24
Public delegated prefix
192.0.2.0/28
global
The remaining IP addresses are reserved for future use.
Project architecture
We recommend that you use organizations to benefit from
features such as IAM permissions at the organization level and
Shared VPC .
See creating and managing organizations
for more information about using an organization.
BYOIP address administration in an organization
In this example of a project belonging to an organization, there is a dedicated
project, Public IP project , used to manage BYOIP addresses. The Public IP
Admin for the organization has created the public advertised prefix and public
delegated prefixes in the Public IP project .
When the VPC project needs public IP addresses, the Public IP Admin for the
organization creates the IP addresses in the VPC project .
The organization can contain multiple projects, and the Public IP Admin can
delegate IP addresses to them all from the Public IP project .
Figure 1. You can use organizations and projects to manage BYOIP
addresses.
BYOIP addresses administration with Shared VPC
In this example of an organization that contains Shared VPC, there is a
dedicated project, Public IP project , used to manage BYOIP addresses. The
Public IP Admin for the organization has created the public advertised prefix
and public delegated prefixes in the Public IP project .
When the Shared VPC host project or the related service projects need public
IP addresses, the Public IP Admin for the organization creates the IP addresses
in the Shared VPC host project . The host project and the service projects can
access the BYOIP addresses from the host project.
Creating IP addresses in a Shared VPC service project is not supported.
Figure 2. You can delegate BYOIP addresses to a Shared VPC host
project, but not to a Shared VPC service project. However, a service
project can use BYOIP addresses that were delegated to the host project.
BYOIP address administration without an organization
If you use a project that does not belong to an organization, you can't create a
separate project for BYOIP address administration. Create the public advertised
prefix and public delegated prefixes in the same project that needs the BYOIP
addresses.
