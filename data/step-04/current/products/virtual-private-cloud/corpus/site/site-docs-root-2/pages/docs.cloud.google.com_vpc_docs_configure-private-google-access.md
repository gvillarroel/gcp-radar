Configure Private Google Access
This page describes how to enable and configure Private Google Access.
By default, when a Compute Engine VM lacks an external IP address
assigned to its network interface, it can only send packets to other internal
IP address destinations. You can allow these VMs to connect to the set of
external IP addresses used by Google APIs and
services by enabling
Private Google Access on the subnet used by the VM's network interface.
Private Google Access also allows access to the external IP addresses used by
App Engine, including third-party App Engine-based services.
To view the eligible APIs and services that you can use with
Private Google Access, see Domain options .
For information about other private connectivity options offered by
Google Cloud, including Private Service Connect and
Private Google Access, see Private access options for
services .
Specifications
A VM interface can send packets to the external IP addresses of Google APIs and
services using Private Google Access if all these conditions are met:
The VM interface is connected to a subnet where Private Google Access is
enabled.
The VPC network that contains the subnet meets the network
requirements for Google APIs and services .
The VM interface does not have an external IP address assigned.
The source IP address of packets sent from the VM matches one of the following
IP addresses.
The VM interface's primary internal IPv4 address
The VM interface's internal IPv6 address
An internal IPv4 address from an alias IP range
A VM with an external IPv4 or IPv6 address assigned to its network
interface doesn't need Private Google Access to
connect to Google APIs and services. However, the VPC network
must meet the requirements for accessing Google APIs and
services .
Network requirements
Private Google Access has the following requirements:
If needed, you enable the API for the services that you want to access:
If you're accessing a Google API service endpoint, you must enable
the API for that service.
For example, to create a Cloud Storage bucket through the
storage.googleapis.com API service endpoint or a client library,
you must enable the Cloud Storage API.
If you're accessing other types of resources, you might not need to
enable any APIs.
For example, to access a Cloud Storage bucket in another project
through its storage.googleapis.com URL, you don't need to enable
the Cloud Storage API.
If you want to connect to Google APIs and services using IPv6, you must meet
both of these requirements:
Your VM must be configured with a /96 IPv6 address
range .
The software running on the VM must send packets whose sources match one
of those IPv6 addresses from that range.
Depending on your chosen configuration, you might need to update
DNS entries, routes, and firewall rules. For more information, see
Summary of configuration options .
Because Private Google Access is enabled on a per-subnet basis, you must
use a VPC network . Legacy
networks are not supported because they don't support subnets.
Permissions
Project owners, editors, and Identity and Access Management principals with the Network
Admin role can create or update
subnets and assign IP addresses.
For more information on roles, read the
IAM roles documentation.
Logging
Cloud Logging captures all API requests made from VM instances in subnets
that have Private Google Access enabled. Log entries identify the source of
the API request as an internal IP address of the calling instance.
You can configure daily usage and monthly rollup reports to be delivered to a
Cloud Storage bucket. See the Viewing Usage
Reports page for details.
Summary of configuration options
The following table summarizes the different ways that you can configure
Private Google Access. For more detailed configuration information, see
Network configuration .
If you want to access Firestore with MongoDB compatibility API
( firestore.goog ), see Configure Private Google Access in
Firestore with MongoDB
compatibility .
Note: Some Google APIs and services offer direct connectivity from
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances, bypassing Google Front Ends
(GFEs). To allow this traffic, you must ensure that your routes and firewall
rules allow egress traffic to reach 34.126.0.0/18 and
2001:4860:8040::/42 . You don't need to create DNS records for these
addresses. Services that offer direct connectivity support
VPC Service Controls.
Domain option
DNS configuration
Routing configuration
Firewall configuration
Default domains
You access Google APIs and services through their public IP addresses,
so no special DNS configuration is required.
Ensure that your VPC network can route traffic to the IP address ranges that
are used by Google APIs and services.
Basic configuration : Confirm that you have
default routes with next hop default-internet-gateway and a destination
range of 0.0.0.0/0 (for IPv4 traffic) and ::/0 (for IPv6
traffic, if needed). Create those routes if they are missing.
Custom configuration : Create routes for the
IP address ranges used by Google APIs and services.
Ensure that your firewall rules allow egress to the
IP address ranges used by Google APIs and services.
The default allow egress firewall rule allows this traffic, if there is no higher priority
rule that blocks it.
private.googleapis.com
Configure DNS records in a private DNS zone to send
requests to the following IP addresses:
For IPv4 traffic:
199.36. 153.8/30
For IPv6 traffic:
2600:2d00: 0002: 2000::/56
Ensure that your VPC network has
routes to the following IP ranges:
For IPv4 traffic:
199.36. 153.8/30
34.126. 0.0/18
For IPv6 traffic:
2600:2d00: 0002: 2000::/56
2001:4860: 8040::/42
Ensure that your firewall rules allow egress to
the following IP ranges:
For IPv4 traffic:
199.36. 153.8/30
34.126. 0.0/18
For IPv6 traffic:
2600:2d00: 0002: 2000::/56
2001:4860: 8040::/42
restricted.googleapis.com
Configure DNS records to send requests to the following IP addresses:
For IPv4 traffic:
199.36. 153.4/30
For IPv6 traffic:
2600:2d00: 0002: 1000::/56
Ensure that your VPC network has
routes to the following IP ranges:
For IPv4 traffic:
199.36. 153.4/30
34.126. 0.0/18
For IPv6 traffic:
2600:2d00: 0002: 1000::/56
2001:4860: 8040::/42
Ensure that your firewall rules allow egress to
the following IP ranges:
For IPv4 traffic:
199.36. 153.4/30
34.126. 0.0/18
For IPv6 traffic:
2600:2d00: 0002: 1000::/56
2001:4860: 8040::/42
Network configuration
This section describes the basic network requirements you must meet in order
for a VM in your VPC network to access Google APIs and services.
Domain options
Choose the domain that you want to use to access Google APIs and services.
The private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com virtual IP
addresses (VIPs) support only HTTP-based protocols over TCP (HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2). All other
protocols, including MQTT and ICMP, are not supported.
Interactive websites and features that use the internet—for example, for redirects or
retrieving content—are not supported.
Domain and IP address ranges
Supported services
Example usage
Default domains.
All domain names for Google APIs and services except for
private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com .
Various IP address ranges—you can determine a set of IP ranges that contains
the possible addresses used by the default domains by referencing
IP addresses for default
domains .
Enables API access to most Google APIs and services regardless of
whether they are supported by VPC Service Controls.
Includes API access to
Google Maps, Google Ads, and Google Cloud. Includes
Google Workspace web applications such as Gmail and Google Docs,
and other web applications.
The default domains are used when you don't configure DNS records for
private.googleapis.com and
restricted.googleapis.com .
private.googleapis.com
199.36.153.8/30
2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56
Enables API access to most Google APIs and services regardless of
whether they are supported by VPC Service Controls.
Includes API access to
Google Maps, Google Ads, Google Cloud, and most other
Google APIs, including the following list. Does not support Google Workspace web
applications such as Gmail and Google Docs.
Domain names that match:
accounts.google.com (only supports paths needed for OAuth authentication of
service accounts; user account authentication is interactive and not supported)
*.aiplatform-notebook.cloud.google.com
*.aiplatform-notebook.googleusercontent.com
appengine.google.com
*.appspot.com
*.backupdr.cloud.google.com

*.dataproc.cloud.google.com
dataproc.cloud.google.com
*.dataproc.googleusercontent.com
dataproc.googleusercontent.com
*.developerconnect.dev
dl.google.com
gcr.io or *.gcr.io

packages.cloud.google.com
pkg.dev or *.pkg.dev
pki.goog or *.pki.goog
*.run.app
source.developers.google.com
storage.cloud.google.com
Use private.googleapis.com to access Google APIs and services
by using a set of IP addresses only routable from within Google Cloud.
Choose private.googleapis.com under these circumstances:
You don't use VPC Service Controls.
You do use VPC Service Controls, but you also need to access Google APIs
and services that are not supported by VPC Service Controls. 1
restricted.googleapis.com
199.36.153.4/30
2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Enables API access to
Google APIs and
services that are supported by VPC Service Controls .
Blocks access to Google APIs and services that do not support
VPC Service Controls .
Does not support Google Workspace APIs or Google Workspace web applications such
as Gmail and Google Docs.
Use restricted.googleapis.com to access Google APIs and services
by using a set of IP addresses only routable from within Google Cloud.
Choose restricted.googleapis.com when you only
need access to Google APIs and services that are supported by
VPC Service Controls.
The restricted.googleapis.com domain does not permit access to Google APIs and
services that do not support VPC Service Controls. 1
1
If you need to restrict users to just the Google APIs and services
that support VPC Service Controls , use
restricted.googleapis.com , as it provides additional risk mitigation for data
exfiltration. Using restricted.googleapis.com denies access to
Google APIs and services that are not supported by VPC Service Controls. See
Setting up private
connectivity in the VPC Service Controls documentation for more details.
IPv6 support for private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com
The following IPv6 address ranges can be used to direct traffic from IPv6
clients to Google APIs and services:
private.googleapis.com : 2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56
restricted.googleapis.com : 2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Consider configuring the IPv6 addresses if you want to use the private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com domain, and you
have clients that use IPv6 addresses. IPv6 clients that also have IPv4 addresses configured can
reach Google APIs and services by using the IPv4 addresses. Not all services accept traffic from
IPv6 clients.
DNS configuration
For connectivity to Google APIs and services, you can choose to send
packets to the IP addresses associated with the private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com VIP. To use a VIP, you must configure DNS so that VMs
in your VPC network reach services by using the VIP addresses
instead of the public IP addresses.
The following sections describe how to use DNS zones to send packets to the IP
addresses that are associated with your chosen VIP. Follow the instructions for
all scenarios that apply to you:
If you use services that have googleapis.com domain names, see
Configure DNS for googleapis.com .
If you use services that have other domain names , see
Configure DNS for other domains . For
example, if you use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you
also need to configure *.gcr.io and *.pkg.dev , or if you use
Cloud Run, you need to configure *.run.app .
If you use Cloud Storage buckets, and you send requests to a
Cloud Storage custom domain name, see Configure DNS for
Cloud Storage custom domain
names .
When you configure DNS records for the VIPs, use only the IP addresses that are
described in the following steps. Do not mix addresses from the
private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com VIPs. This can
cause intermittent failures because the services that are offered differ
based on a packet's destination.
Note: There are public DNS records for private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com. However, you can't use the public records to access
Google APIs. You must create a private DNS zone and records.
Configure DNS for googleapis.com
Create a DNS zone and records for googleapis.com :
Create a private DNS zone for googleapis.com . Consider creating a
Cloud DNS private zone for this
purpose.
In the googleapis.com zone, create the following private DNS records for either
private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com , depending on which
domain you've chosen to use.
For private.googleapis.com :
Create an A record for private.googleapis.com pointing to the
following IP addresses: 199.36.153.8 , 199.36.153.9 , 199.36.153.10 , 199.36.153.11 .
To connect to APIs using IPv6 addresses, also configure an AAAA
record for private.googleapis.com pointing to 2600:2d00:0002:2000:: .
For restricted.googleapis.com :
Create an A record for restricted.googleapis.com pointing to the
following IP addresses: 199.36.153.4 , 199.36.153.5 , 199.36.153.6 , 199.36.153.7 .
To connect to APIs using IPv6 addresses, also create an AAAA
record for restricted.googleapis.com pointing to
2600:2d00:0002:1000:: .
To create private DNS records in Cloud DNS, see
add a record .
In the googleapis.com zone, create a CNAME record for *.googleapis.com
that points to the domain that you've configured: private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com .
Configure DNS for other domains
Some Google APIs and services are provided using additional domain names,
including *.gcr.io , *.gstatic.com , *.pkg.dev , pki.goog , *.run.app , and *.gke.goog .
Refer to the domain and IP address ranges table in Domain options
to determine if the additional domain's services can be accessed using private.googleapis.com
or restricted.googleapis.com . Then, for each of the additional domains:
Create a DNS zone for DOMAIN (for example, gcr.io ).
If you're using Cloud DNS, make sure this zone is located in the
same project as your googleapis.com private zone.
In this DNS zone, create the following private DNS records for either
private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com , depending on which
domain you've chosen to use.
For private.googleapis.com :
Create an A record for DOMAIN pointing to the following
IP addresses: 199.36.153.8 , 199.36.153.9 , 199.36.153.10 , 199.36.153.11 .
To connect to APIs using IPv6 addresses, also create an AAAA
record for DOMAIN pointing to 2600:2d00:0002:2000:: .
For restricted.googleapis.com :
Create an A record for DOMAIN pointing to the following
IP addresses: 199.36.153.4 , 199.36.153.5 , 199.36.153.6 , 199.36.153.7 .
To connect to APIs using IPv6 addresses, also create an AAAA
record for DOMAIN pointing to
2600:2d00:0002:1000:: .
In the DOMAIN zone, create a CNAME record for
*. DOMAIN that points to DOMAIN .
For example, create a CNAME record for *.gcr.io that points to
gcr.io .
Configure DNS for Cloud Storage custom domain names
If you are using Cloud Storage buckets, and you send requests to a
Cloud Storage custom domain name ,
configuring DNS records for the custom Cloud Storage domain name to point to
the IP addresses for private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com is
not sufficient to allow access to the Cloud Storage buckets.
If you want to send requests to a Cloud Storage custom domain name, you must also explicitly
set the HTTP request's Host header and TLS SNI to storage.googleapis.com The
IP addresses for private.googleapis.com and restricted.googleapis.com do not
support custom Cloud Storage hostnames in HTTP request Host headers and TLS
SNIs.
Routing options
Your VPC network must have appropriate routes whose next hops are
the default internet gateway. Google Cloud does not support routing
traffic to Google APIs and services through other VM instances or custom next
hops. Despite being called default internet gateway , packets sent from VMs
in your VPC network to Google APIs and services remain within
Google's network.
If you select the default domains, your VM instances connect to Google APIs
and services using a subset of Google's external IP
addresses . These IP addresses are publicly routable, but
the path from a VM in a VPC network to those addresses remains
within Google's network.
Google doesn't publish routes on the internet to any of the IP addresses used
by either the private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com domains. Consequently, these domains
can only be accessed by VMs in a VPC network or on-premises
systems connected to a VPC network.
If your VPC network contains a default
route whose next hop is the default
internet gateway, you can use that route to access Google APIs and services,
without needing to create custom routes. See routing with a default
route for details.
If you have replaced a default route (destination 0.0.0.0/0 or ::0/0 ) with
a custom route whose next hop is not the default internet gateway, you can
meet the routing requirements for Google APIs and services using custom
routing instead.
If your VPC network does not have an IPv6 default route, you
won't have IPv6 connectivity to Google APIs and services.
Add an IPv6 default route to allow
IPv6 connectivity.
Routing with a default route
Each VPC network contains an IPv4 default route ( 0.0.0.0/0 )
when it is created. If you enable external IPv6 addresses on a subnet, a
system-generated IPv6 default route ( ::/0 ) is added to that VPC
network.
The default routes provides a path to the IP addresses for the following destinations:
The default domains.
private.googleapis.com : 199.36.153.8/30 and 2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56 .
restricted.googleapis.com : 199.36.153.4/30 and 2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56 .
To check the configuration of a default route in a given network, follow these
directions.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Routes page.
Go to Routes
Filter the list of routes to show just the routes for the network you
need to inspect.
Look for a route whose destination is 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 traffic or
::/0 for IPv6 traffic and whose next hop is
default internet gateway .
gcloud
Use the following gcloud command, replacing NETWORK_NAME with
the name of the network to inspect:
gcloud compute routes list \
--filter="default-internet-gateway NETWORK_NAME "
If you need to create a replacement default IPv4 route, see Adding a static
route .
If you need to create a replacement default IPv6 route, see Adding an IPv6
default route .
Custom routing
As an alternative to a default route, you can use custom static routes, each
having a more specific destination, and each using the default internet gateway
next hop. The number of routes you need and their destination IP addresses
depend on the domain that you choose .
Default domains: you must have routes for the IP address ranges for Google
APIs and services .
private.googleapis.com : 199.36.153.8/30 and
2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56
restricted.googleapis.com : 199.36.153.4/30 and
2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Additionally, we recommend that you add routes for 34.126.0.0/18
and 2001:4860:8040::/42 . For more information, see Summary of
configuration options .
To check the configuration of custom routes for Google APIs and services in a
given network, follow these directions.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Routes page.
Go to Routes
Use the Filter table text field to filter the list of routes using
the following criteria, replacing NETWORK_NAME with the name
of your VPC network.
Network: NETWORK_NAME
Next hop type: default internet gateway
Look at the Destination IP range column for each route. If you chose
the default domains, check for several custom static routes, one for
each IP address range used by the default domain . If
you chose private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com , look
for that domain's IP range .
gcloud
Use the following gcloud command, replacing NETWORK_NAME with
the name of the network to inspect:
gcloud compute routes list \
--filter="default-internet-gateway NETWORK_NAME "
Routes are listed in table format unless you customize the command with the
--format flag. Look in the DEST_RANGE column for the destination of each
route. If you chose the default domains, check for several custom static
routes, one for each IP address range used by the default
domain . If you chose private.googleapis.com or
restricted.googleapis.com , look for that domain's IP range .
If you need to create routes, see Adding a static
route .
Firewall configuration
The firewall configuration of your VPC network must allow access
from VMs to the IP addresses used by Google APIs and services. The implied
allow egress rule satisfies this requirement.
In some firewall configurations, you need to create specific egress allow rules.
For example, suppose you've created an egress deny rule that blocks traffic to
all destinations ( 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 or ::/0 for IPv6). In that case, you must
create one egress allow firewall rule whose priority is higher than the egress
deny rule for each IP address range used by your chosen domain
for Google APIs and services.
Default domains: all IP address ranges for Google APIs and
services .
private.googleapis.com : 199.36.153.8/30 and
2600:2d00:0002:2000::/56
restricted.googleapis.com : 199.36.153.4/30 and
2600:2d00:0002:1000::/56
Additionally, we recommend that you include 34.126.0.0/18 and
2001:4860:8040::/42 in your egress allow firewall rule. For more
information, see Summary of configuration options .
To create firewall rules, see Creating firewall
rules . You can limit the VMs
to which the firewall rules apply when you define the
target of each egress allow rule.
IP addresses for default domains
This section describes how to create a list of default domain IP ranges used by
Google APIs and services. These ranges are allocated dynamically and change
often, so it's not possible to define specific IP ranges for individual services
or APIs. To maintain an accurate list, set up automation to run the script every
day.
If you have strict egress requirements, don't use the IP addresses for the
default domains. Use a Private Service Connect
endpoint , or the
private.googleapis.com or restricted.googleapis.com VIP . These
options require additional DNS configuration, but don't require that you
maintain a list of IP address ranges.
Follow these steps to determine the IP address ranges used by the default
domains, such as *.googleapis.com .
Google publishes a list of Google-owned IP addresses in
goog.json .
Google also publishes a list of global and regional external IP addresses
ranges available for customers' Google Cloud resources in
cloud.json .
Taking away all ranges in cloud.json from those in goog.json results in a
large set of IP addresses that are used by global Google APIs and other Google
services, including customer-facing products outside of Google Cloud.
These lists are updated frequently.
You can use the following Python script to create a list of IP address ranges
that include those used by the default domains for Google APIs and services.
For information about running this script, see How to
run .

Note: In the past, Google Cloud published a list of IP address ranges
in the _spf.google.com DNS TXT record (and the records it referenced). While
this DNS TXT record continues to be accurate for SPF
purposes ,
it does not contain the complete set of possible IP address ranges used by the default domains for Google APIs and services.
Private Google Access configuration
You can enable Private Google Access after you've met the network
requirements in your VPC network.
Enable Private Google Access
Follow these steps to enable Private Google Access:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks page.
Go to VPC networks
Click the name of the network that contains the subnet for which you need
to enable Private Google Access.
For an existing subnet:
Click the name of the subnet. The Subnet details page is
displayed.
Click Edit .
In the Private Google Access section, select On .
Click Save .
For a new subnet:
Click Add subnet .
Enter a Name .
Select a Region .
For IP stack type , select one of the following:
IPv4 (single-stack)
IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack)
IPv6 (single-stack) ( Preview )
If you are creating a subnet with an IPv4 address range, enter an
IPv4 range. This is the primary IPv4
range for the subnet.
If you select a range that is not an RFC 1918 address, confirm that
the range doesn't conflict with an existing configuration. For more
information, see IPv4 subnet
ranges .
If you are creating a subnet with an IPv6 address range, select an
IPv6 access type: Internal or External .
If you want to set the access type to Internal , but the
Internal option is not available, check that an internal IPv6
range is
assigned
on the network.
Make other selections for the new subnet to meet your needs. For
example, you might need to create secondary subnet IP ranges or
enable VPC Flow Logs.
Select On in the Private Google Access section.

gcloud
For an existing subnet:
Determine the name and region of the subnet. To list the subnets for a
particular network, use the following command:
gcloud compute networks subnets list --filter= NETWORK_NAME
Run the following command to enable Private Google Access:
gcloud compute networks subnets update SUBNET_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--enable-private-ip-google-access
Verify that Private Google Access is enabled by running this command:
gcloud compute networks subnets describe SUBNET_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--format="get(privateIpGoogleAccess)"
In all above commands, replace the following with valid values:
SUBNET_NAME : the name of the subnet
REGION : the region for the subnet
NETWORK_NAME : the name of the VPC network that
contains the subnet
When creating a new
subnet , use the
--enable-private-ip-google-access flag to enable Private Google Access:
gcloud compute networks subnets create SUBNET_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--network= NETWORK_NAME \
--range= PRIMARY_IPV4_RANGE \
[ --stack-type= STACK_TYPE ] \
[ --ipv6-access-type= IPv6_ACCESS_TYPE ] \
--enable-private-ip-google-access
Replace the following with valid values:
SUBNET_NAME : the name of the subnet
REGION : the region for the subnet
NETWORK_NAME : the name of the VPC network that
contains the subnet
PRIMARY_IPV4_RANGE : the subnet's primary IPv4 address range.
If you are creating an IPv6-only subnet, omit this flag.
STACK_TYPE is the stack type for the subnet:
IPV4_ONLY , IPV4_IPV6 , or IPV6_ONLY .
IPv6_ACCESS_TYPE is the IPv6 access type: EXTERNAL or
INTERNAL . Only specify the IPv6 access type if you have also specified
--stack-type=IPV4_IPV6 or --stack-type=IPV6_ONLY .
Disable Private Google Access
Follow these steps to disable Private Google Access for an existing subnet:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks page.
Go to VPC networks
Click the name of the network that contains the subnet for which you need
to disable Private Google Access.
Click the name of an existing subnet. The Subnet details page is
displayed.
Click Edit .
In the Private Google Access section, select Off .
Click Save .
gcloud
Determine the name and region of the subnet. To list the subnets for a
particular network, use the following command:
gcloud compute networks subnets list \
--filter= NETWORK_NAME
Run the following command to disable Private Google Access:
gcloud compute networks subnets update SUBNET_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--no-enable-private-ip-google-access
Run the following command to verify that Private Google Access is
disabled:
gcloud compute networks subnets describe SUBNET_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--format="get(privateIpGoogleAccess)"
In all above commands, replace the following with valid values:
SUBNET_NAME : the name of the subnet
REGION : the region for the subnet
NETWORK_NAME : the name of the VPC network that
contains the subnet
