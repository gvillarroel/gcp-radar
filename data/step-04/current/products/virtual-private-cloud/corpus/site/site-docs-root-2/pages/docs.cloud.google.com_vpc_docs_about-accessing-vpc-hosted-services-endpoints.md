About accessing published services through
endpoints
This document provides an overview of connecting to services in another
VPC network by using Private Service Connect
endpoints. You can connect to your own services, or those provided by other
service producers, including by Google.
Clients connect to the endpoint by using internal IP addresses.
Private Service Connect performs network address translation
(NAT) to route the request to the service.
For more information about published services, see
About published services .
A Private Service Connect endpoint
lets service consumers send traffic from the consumer's VPC
network to services in the service producer's VPC network.
The consumer, endpoint, and service must all be in the same region.

Different load balancers support different port configurations; some load
balancers support a single port, some support a range of ports, and some support
all ports. For more information, see Port
specifications .
Limitations
Endpoints that access a published service have the following limitations:
You can't create an endpoint in the same
VPC network as the
published service that you
are accessing.
Packet Mirroring can't mirror packets
for Private Service Connect published services traffic.
Not all static routes with load balancer next hops are supported with
Private Service Connect. For more information, see Static routes with load
balancer next hops .
Connectivity Tests can't test connectivity between an IPv6 endpoint and a published
service.
On-premises access
Endpoints that you use to access
Google APIs can be accessed from supported connected on-premises hosts. For
more information, see
Access endpoints from hybrid networks .
Specifications
Private Service Connect endpoints must be created in the same
region as the published service that is the target of the endpoint.
The endpoint must be created in a different VPC network
than the VPC network that contains the target service.
If you're using Shared VPC, you can
create the endpoint in either the host project or a service project.
By default, the endpoint can be accessed only by clients that are in the
same region and the same VPC network (or Shared VPC
network) as the endpoint. For information about making endpoints available
in other regions, see Global access .
The IP address that you assign to the endpoint must be from a
regular subnet .
You can use an IPv4 address from an IPv4-only subnet or a dual-stack
subnet.
You can use an IPv6 address from an IPv6-only
or dual-stack subnet if the subnet has
an internal IPv6 address
range .
The IP version of the IP address affects which published services the
endpoint can connect to. For more information, see
IP version translation .
The IP address counts toward the project's quota for
static internal IPv4 addresses
or
static internal IPv6 addresses .
When you create an endpoint to connect to a service, if the service has a
DNS domain name configured, private DNS entries are automatically created
in your VPC network for the endpoint.
Each endpoint has its own unique IP address and optionally its own unique
DNS name.
Published service backends
( Preview )
let you configure supported regional load balancers or Cloud Service Mesh
to route traffic to published services through
Private Service Connect endpoints.
Connection statuses
Private Service Connect endpoints, backends, and service attachments have connection
statuses that describe the state of their connections. The consumer and producer resources that
form the two sides of a connection always have the same status.
You can view connection statuses when you
view endpoint details ,
describe a backend , or
view details for a published service .
The following table describes the possible statuses.
Connection status
Description
Accepted
The Private Service Connect connection is accepted by the producer, and
the connection is permitted by configuration. However, this status doesn't guarantee that
traffic can flow through the connection.
Pending
The Private Service Connect connection is not established, and network traffic
can't travel between the two networks. A connection might have this status for the following
reasons:
The service attachment requires explicit approval ,
and the consumer is not in the consumer accept list.
The number of connections exceeds the service attachment's connection limit .
Connections that are blocked for these reasons remain in the pending state indefinitely
until the underlying issue is resolved.
Rejected
The Private Service Connect connection is not established. Network traffic
can't travel between the two networks. A connection might have this status for the following
reasons:
A producer
organization policy
rejected the connection.
A
consumer reject list
rejected the connection.
Needs attention
There is an issue on the producer side of the connection. Some traffic might be able to
flow between the two networks, but some connections might not be functional. For example,
the producer's NAT subnet
might be exhausted and unable to allocate IP addresses for new connections.
Closed
The service attachment was deleted, and the
Private Service Connect connection is closed. Network traffic
can't travel between the two networks.
A closed connection is a terminal state . To restore the connection, you must
recreate both the service attachment and the endpoint or backend.
IP version translation
For Private Service Connect endpoints that connect to published services
(service attachments), the IP version of the consumer forwarding rule's IP address determines
the IP version of the endpoint and traffic that egresses the endpoint. The IP address can come
from an IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or dual-stack subnet. The IP version of the endpoint can be either
IPv4 or IPv6, but not both.
For published services, the IP version of the service attachment is determined by the IP
address of the associated forwarding rule or Secure Web Proxy instance. This IP address must be
compatible with the stack type of the service attachment's
NAT subnet .
The NAT subnet can be an IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or dual-stack subnet.
If the NAT subnet is a dual-stack subnet, either the IPv4 or IPv6 address range is used, but not
both.
Private Service Connect doesn't support connecting an IPv4 endpoint
with an IPv6 service attachment. In this case, the endpoint creation fails with the following
error message:
Private Service Connect forwarding rule with an IPv4 address
cannot target an IPv6 service attachment.
The following combinations are possible for
supported
configurations :
IPv4 endpoint to IPv4 service attachment
IPv6 endpoint to IPv6 service attachment
IPv6 endpoint to IPv4 service attachment
In this configuration, Private Service Connect automatically translates
between the two IP versions.
Connection propagation
With propagated connections, services that are accessible in one
consumer VPC spoke through
Private Service Connect endpoints
can be privately accessed by other consumer VPC spokes that are
connected to the same Network Connectivity Center hub.
For more information, see About propagated connections .
Global access
Private Service Connect endpoints that are used to access
services are regional resources. However, you can make an endpoint available in
other regions by configuring global
access .
Global access lets resources in any region send traffic to
Private Service Connect endpoints. You can use global access to
provide high availability across services that are hosted in multiple regions,
or to allow clients to access a service that is not in the same region as the
client.
The following diagram illustrates clients in different regions accessing the
same endpoint:
The endpoint is in us-west1 and has global access configured.
The VM in us-west1 can send traffic to the endpoint, and the traffic stays
within the same region.
The VM in us-east1 and the VM from the on-premises network can also
connect the endpoint in us-west1 , even though they are in different
regions. The dotted lines represent the inter-regional traffic path.
A Private Service Connect endpoint with global access
lets service consumers send traffic from the consumer's VPC
network to services in the service producer's VPC network.
The client can be in the same region or a different region as the endpoint
(click to enlarge).
Global access specifications
You can turn global access on or off at any time for an endpoint.
Turning on global access does not cause traffic disruption for existing
connections.
Turning off global access terminates any connections from regions other
than the region where the endpoint is located.
Not all Private Service Connect services support endpoints
with global access. If you connect a global access endpoint to a service
that isn't configured for global access, traffic might be sent to
unhealthy backends and dropped ( known issue ).
Check with your service producer to verify if their
service supports global access. For more information, see Supported
configurations .
Global access does not provide a single global IP address or DNS name for
multiple global access endpoints.
Published service backends
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
If both the producer and consumer VPC networks belong to the same
organization ,
you can access a published service by using published service backends.
Published service backends let you configure
supported load balancers or regional Cloud Service Mesh
to route traffic to published services through
Private Service Connect endpoints.
This approach provides the following benefits:
Unified connectivity : Supported load balancers and regional
Cloud Service Mesh
can access published services through the same
Private Service Connect endpoint. This lets you extend access
to Cloud Service Mesh
applications by using the same endpoint that you use for load balancers.
Separation of network and service management : Service owners can connect
load balancers or
Cloud Service Mesh to published services by providing a reference to the
producer's service attachment. They don't need to manage or refer to
specific Private Service Connect endpoints, which can be
managed independently by network administrators.
Advanced traffic management and security : When you access a
published service through a consumer load balancer, the load balancer
can act as a centralized policy enforcement point where security policies
(such as Google Cloud Armor policies
and SSL policies ) or
routing policies (such as
Google Cloud URL maps )
are enforced.
Observability : A load balancer can provide centralized metrics and
logging that a published service might not provide.
To use published service backends, you need a pre-existing
Private Service Connect endpoint that connects to the service
you want to access; configuring a published service backend doesn't
automatically create one for you.
To use a published service backend with a load balancer, you
associate the load balancer's backend service with a service attachment .
You don't explicitly associate the load balancer with an endpoint.
Instead, when a client sends a request to the load balancer, the load balancer
routes traffic through a Private Service Connect
endpoint that matches the following criteria:
The endpoint connects to the service attachment that is specified in the
consumer load balancer's backend.
The endpoint has a connection status of ACCEPTED .
The endpoint is in the same VPC network and region as the
consumer forwarding rule.
For information about configuring published service backends to access published
services with regional Cloud Service Mesh, see
Configure published service backends for Cloud Service Mesh .
Supported configurations
The following table lists the supported configurations for using published service backends with
Private Service Connect endpoints. Consumer support indicates that the
configuration can access a published service by using published service backends. Producer support
indicates that the load balancer can be used to publish a service that is accessible through
published service backends.

Shared VPC
Service Project Admins can create
endpoints in Shared VPC service
projects that use IP addresses from
Shared VPC networks . The
configuration is the same as for a regular endpoint, but the endpoint uses an IP
address that's reserved from a shared subnet of the Shared VPC.
The IP address resource can be reserved in the service project or the host
project. The source of the IP address must be a subnet that is
shared with the service project.
For more information, see
Create an endpoint with an IP address from a Shared VPC network .
VPC Service Controls
VPC Service Controls and Private Service Connect are
compatible with each other. If the VPC network where the
Private Service Connect endpoint is deployed is in a
VPC Service Controls perimeter, the
endpoint is part of the same perimeter. Any
VPC Service Controls-supported services
that are accessed through the endpoint
are subject to the policies of that VPC Service Controls perimeter.
When you create an endpoint, control-plane
API calls are made between the consumer and producer projects to establish a
Private Service Connect connection. Establishing a
Private Service Connect connection between consumer and producer
projects that are not in the same VPC Service Controls perimeter does not
require explicit authorization with egress policies. Communication to
VPC Service Controls-supported services through the
endpoint is protected by the
VPC Service Controls perimeter.
Static routes with load balancer next hops
Static routes can be configured to use the forwarding rule of an
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer as the next
hop
( --next-hop-ilb ). Not all routes of this type are supported with
Private Service Connect.
Static routes that use --next-hop-ilb to specify the name of an
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer forwarding rule can be used to send and receive traffic to a
Private Service Connect endpoint when the route and the endpoint
are in the same VPC network and region.
The following routing configurations are not supported with
Private Service Connect:
Static routes that use --next-hop-ilb to specify the IP address of an
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer forwarding rule.
Static routes that use --next-hop-ilb to specify the name or
IP address of a Private Service Connect endpoint forwarding
rule.
Logging
You can enable VPC Flow Logs on subnets containing VMs that are accessing
services in another VPC network using
endpoints. The logs show flows between
the VMs and the endpoint.
You can view changes in connection
status
for endpoints using audit
logs . Changes in connection
status for the endpoint are captured in system event metadata for the resource
type GCE forwarding rule . You can filter for
pscConnectionStatus to view these entries.
For example, when a service producer allows connections from your project, the
connection status of the endpoint changes from PENDING to ACCEPTED , and
this change is reflected in the audit logs.
To view audit logs, see View logs .
To set alerts based on audit logs, see Managing log-based
alerts .
Pricing
Pricing for Private Service Connect is described in the
VPC pricing page .
Quotas
The number of
endpoints that you can create for accessing published services
is controlled by the PSC Internal LB Forwarding Rules quota.
For more information, see quotas .
Organization policy constraints
An Organization Policy Administrator can use the
constraints/compute.disablePrivateServiceConnectCreationForConsumers constraint
to define the set of endpoint types for
which users cannot create forwarding rules.
For information about creating an organization policy that uses this constraint,
see Block consumers from deploying endpoints by connection type .
