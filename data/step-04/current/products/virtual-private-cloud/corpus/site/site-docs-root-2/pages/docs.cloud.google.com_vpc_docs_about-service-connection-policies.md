About service connection policies
This document explains how network administrators can use service connection
policies to provide connectivity to supported managed service instances through
service connectivity automation. Before reading this document, ensure that
you're familiar with the concepts explained in About service connectivity
automation .
Specifications
Service connection policies have the following specifications:
You can create only one service connection policy for each combination of
network, region, and service
class . For
example, you can have only one service connection policy for vpc1 in
us-central1 for google-cloud-sql . This validation means that only one
service connection policy governs a given Private Service Connect
endpoint.
Service instance administrators can use the service's administrative API or
UI to deploy that service and configure connectivity by using service
connectivity automation.
If the creation or deletion of an endpoint through
service connectivity automation is blocked, an
automated process periodically retries the operation
until the blocking issue is resolved.
The subnets that are included in the service connection policy configuration
provide IP addresses that are assigned to Private Service Connect
endpoints. These IP addresses are automatically
allocated and returned to the subnet's pool as managed service instances are
created and deleted.
The subnets must be regular
subnets , and they must be in the same region as
the service connection policy. Regular subnets are different from
Private Service Connect subnets.
As a best practice, we recommend that you avoid using the subnets for other
resources. If other resources consume IP addresses from the subnet, you
might run out of IP addresses to assign to endpoints.
Managed services that use service connection policies might support
connecting to service instances by using IPv4 endpoints, IPv6 endpoints, or
both . If the service supports both IPv4 and IPv6, service
instance administrators can choose an IP version when deploying a service
instance.
You can use service connection policies with Shared VPC .
By default, the service instance and the endpoints that connect to the
service instance must be in the same project (or in the case of
Shared VPC, in connected projects).
Supported Google services let you configure a custom service instance
scope .
Endpoints that are created through service connectivity automation might
have labels applied to them by the service producer. For more information
about labels, see Organize resources using
labels .
If you want to use Private Service Connect service automation with
multiple VPC networks that are in the same project, create a
service connection policy for each network.
You can optionally configure a connection limit to specify the maximum
number of Private Service Connect connections that a
given service producer can create in the policy's VPC
network and region.
Endpoints that are created through service connection policies can be made
available in other VPC networks through connection
propagation .
Authorization
Service connection policies let consumers delegate the deployment of
connectivity to managed services. The service producer doesn't have direct
access or IAM privileges for the consumer project. Instead, the
producer configures a service connection map in their own project.
When the service connection map is created or updated, typically in response to
a request from a consumer service administrator to the managed service's
administrative API or UI, service connectivity automation performs a series of
authorization checks. If all of the checks pass,
Private Service Connect endpoints are created as specified in the
request.
For information about authorization, see
Authorization model .
Connection policies in Shared VPC networks
Service connection policies can automate connectivity to service instances that
are located in host projects or in attached service projects.
If you're using Shared VPC, you must create the service connection
policy in the host project. Endpoints are created in the project that is
specified in the service instance configuration.
If you create a service connection policy in a Shared VPC network
and deploy a service instance in a service project, service
connectivity automation shares the subnets that are associated with the
service connection policy by updating the service project's
Network Connectivity Service Account .
This service account is granted the
Compute Network User role
( roles/compute.networkUser ) on the shared subnets.
For a deployment example, see
Shared VPC .
Connection policies with custom service instance scope
By default, service connectivity automation creates endpoints for service
instances and associated service connection policies that are in the same
Google Cloud project (or in the case of Shared VPC, in connected projects).
For supported Google services, service instances and connecting endpoints
can also be in different projects or organizations.
Not all Google services support configuring a custom service instance scope.
To determine whether a service supports a custom service instance scope, see the
documentation for the specific service.
Use the Service instance scope ( --producer-instance-location )
setting to configure connectivity to service instances that are in other
Resource Manager nodes (projects, folders, and organizations).
If it's set to no_producer_instance_location , endpoints are created in the
same project only. This is the default value.
If it's set to custom_resource_hierarchy_levels , you specify the list of
Resource Manager nodes in the
--allowed-google-producers-resource-hierarchy-level field.
If you update the service instance scope for a service connection policy,
existing endpoints aren't affected.
For a deployment example, see Google services with custom service instance
scope .
Endpoint IP versions
The possible IP versions of endpoints that connect to service instances
(IPv4, IPv6, or both) is determined by the service producer, not by service
connectivity automation. If the service supports both IPv4 and IPv6,
service instance administrators can choose an IP version when deploying an
instance through a service's administrative API.
For information about a service's supported IP versions, see the service's
documentation.
When a service instance administrator chooses an IP version, service
connectivity automation checks the service connection policy for compatible
subnets to use for creating endpoint IP addresses:
IPv4-only subnets support IPv4 endpoints.
Dual-stack subnets support both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.
IPv6-only subnets support IPv6 endpoints.
If the service connection policy doesn't have a compatible subnet, the request
fails, and no endpoint is created.
Additionally, the IP version of the endpoint must be compatible with the IP
version of the service instance, which is determined by the associated service
attachment's forwarding rule. Private Service Connect supports
the following IP version combinations:
IPv4 endpoint to IPv4 service attachment
IPv6 endpoint to IPv6 service attachment
IPv6 endpoint to IPv4 service attachment
In this configuration, Private Service Connect automatically
translates between the two IP versions.
Connecting an IPv4 endpoint to an IPv6 service attachment isn't supported.
If you want to let both IPv4 and IPv6 clients access a managed service instance,
configure connectivity for separate IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints that
connect to the same service.
Limitations
Service connection policies only support automating the creation
of Private Service Connect endpoints.
Creating Private Service Connect backends or
service attachments isn't supported.
You cannot directly delete Private Service Connect endpoints that are
created through service connectivity automation. To trigger deletion of these
endpoints, decommission service connectivity .
You can only update the subnets and connection limit for a service connection
policy. If you want to update other fields,
delete the policy
and create a new one .
Pricing
Pricing for Private Service Connect is described on the
VPC pricing page .
