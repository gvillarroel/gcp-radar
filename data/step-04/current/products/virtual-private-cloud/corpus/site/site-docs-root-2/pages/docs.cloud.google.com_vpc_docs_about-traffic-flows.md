About traffic flows
This page describes how VPC Flow Logs reports logs for common traffic
flows. See the following sections for examples:
VM flows , GKE flows ,
Serverless flows , and
Hybrid connectivity flows describe
flows within Google Cloud and flows between Google Cloud and
resources outside of Google Cloud. Examples for flows between different
Google Cloud projects assume VPC Flow Logs is configured at the
project level.
Flows between VPC networks in different projects
describes how cross-project flows are annotated when VPC Flow Logs
is configured at the organization level.
VM flows
The following sections provide examples of how VPC Flow Logs
annotates traffic flows from and to virtual machine (VM) instances.
VM-to-VM flows in the same VPC network
VM flows within a VPC network (click to enlarge).
For VM-to-VM flows in the same VPC network, flow logs are
reported from both requesting and responding VMs, as long as both VMs are in
subnets that have VPC Flow Logs enabled. In this example, VM 10.10.0.2
sends a request with 1,224 bytes to VM 10.50.0.2 , which is also in a subnet
that has logging enabled. In turn, 10.50.0.2 responds to the request with a
reply containing 5,342 bytes. Both the request and reply are recorded from both
the requesting and responding VMs.

VM-to-external IP address flows
VM-to-external IP address flows (click to enlarge).
For flows that traverse the internet between a VM that's in a VPC
network and an endpoint with an external IP address, flow
logs are reported from the VM that's in the VPC network only:
For egress flows, the logs are reported from the VPC network VM
that is the source of the traffic.
For ingress flows, the logs are reported from the VPC network
VM that is the destination of the traffic.
In this example, VM 10.10.0.2 exchanges packets over the internet with an
endpoint that has the external IP address 203.0.113.5 . The outbound traffic
of 1,224 bytes sent from 10.10.0.2 to 203.0.113.5 is reported from the
source VM, 10.10.0.2 . The inbound traffic of 5,342 bytes sent from
203.0.113.5 to 10.10.0.2 is reported from the destination of the traffic,
VM 10.10.0.2 .

VM-to-VM flows for Shared VPC
Shared VPC flows (click to enlarge).
For VM-to-VM flows for
Shared VPC , you can enable VPC Flow Logs for
the subnet in the host project. For example, subnet 10.10.0.0/20 belongs to a
Shared VPC network defined in a host project. You can see flow logs from
VMs belonging to this subnet, including ones created by service projects. In
this example, the service projects are called "web server", "recommendation",
"database".
For VM-to-VM flows, if both VMs are in the same project, or in the case of a
shared network, the same host project, annotations for project ID and
the like are provided for the other endpoint in the connection. If the other
VM is in a different project, then annotations for the other VM are not
provided.
The following table shows a flow as reported by either 10.10.0.10 or
10.10.0.20 .
src_vpc.project_id and dest_vpc.project_id are for the host project
because the VPC subnet belongs to the host project.
src_instance.project_id and dest_instance.project_id are for the service
projects because the instances belong to the service projects.

VM-to-VM flows for VPC Network Peering
VPC Network Peering flows (click to enlarge).
Unless both VMs are in the same Google Cloud project, VM-to-VM flows for
peered VPC networks are reported in the
same way as for external
endpoints—project and other annotation information for the other VM are
not provided. If both VMs are in the same project, even if in different
networks, then project and other annotation information is provided for the
other VM as well.
In this example, the subnets of VM 10.10.0.2 in project analytics-prod and
VM 10.50.0.2 in project webserver-test are connected through
VPC Network Peering.
If VPC Flow Logs is enabled in project analytics-prod, the traffic
(1,224 bytes) sent from 10.10.0.2 to 10.50.0.2 is reported from
VM 10.10.0.2 , which is the source of the flow. The traffic
(5,342 bytes) sent from 10.50.0.2 to 10.10.0.2 is also reported from
VM 10.10.0.2 , which is the destination of the flow.
In this example, VPC Flow Logs is not turned on in project webserver-test,
so no logs are recorded by VM 10.50.0.2 .

VM-to-VM flows through Private Service Connect
VPC Flow Logs annotates flows between
Private Service Connect consumers and published services.
The following example describes how VPC Flow Logs annotates log
records for consumer and producer VMs.
VM flows through Private Service Connect (click to enlarge).
Traffic flows to Private Service Connect published services are
reported from both consumer and producer VMs as long as both VMs are in subnets
that have VPC Flow Logs enabled. In this example, the consumer VM,
10.10.0.2 , sends a request with 1,224 bytes to the
Private Service Connect endpoint, 10.10.0.3 . In the producer
VPC, the source IP address of the request is
translated to an IP address in the service attachment subnet, which, in this
example, is 10.40.0.2 . The destination IP address of the request is translated
to the IP address of the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, 10.50.0.3 . The request then reaches
the backend VM, 10.50.0.2 , which is also in a subnet that has logging enabled.
In turn, 10.50.0.2 responds to the request with a reply containing 5,342
bytes. Both the request and the reply are recorded from both the requesting and
responding VMs. The logs from the consumer VM are available in the
consumer project, and the logs from the producer VM are available in the
producer project.

VM-to-Google API flows
For VM traffic to Google APIs through the VM's external IP
address, Private Google Access, or a Private Service Connect
endpoint, VPC Flow Logs annotates log records with Google API
information.
The following example describes how VPC Flow Logs
annotates log records for a VM accessing a global Google API through a
Private Service Connect endpoint.
VM flows to Google APIs through Private Service Connect (click to enlarge).
Traffic flows to a Google API are reported by consumer VMs, as long as the VM is
in a subnet that has VPC Flow Logs enabled. In this example,
the consumer VM, 10.10.0.2 , sends a request with 1,224 bytes to the
Private Service Connect endpoint, 10.10.110.10 . The request is
forwarded to the appropriate Google service, for example, Cloud Storage. In
turn, Cloud Storage responds to the request with a reply containing
5,342 bytes. Both the request and the reply are recorded from the requesting VM.

VM flows through Cloud Load Balancing
VPC Flow Logs annotates traffic sent through a
passthrough Network Load Balancer, proxy Network Load Balancer, or an Application Load Balancer.
The following examples assume that these load balancers are configured as
internal load balancers.
VM-to-VM flows through an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer flows (click to enlarge).
When you add a VM to the backend service for an
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer , Google Cloud adds the IP
address of the load balancer to
the local routing table of the VM. This allows the VM to accept request packets
with destinations set to the IP address of the load balancer. When the VM
replies, it sends its response directly; however, the source IP address for the
response packets is set to the IP address of the load balancer, not the VM being
load balanced.
VM-to-VM flows sent through an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer are reported from both
source and destination.

In the request that the load balancer distributes to the backend VM, the source
IP address is set to the IP address of the client VM. This means that the
backend VM can supply src_instance and dest_instance information about the
client VM. However, unlike the backend VM, the client VM can't add
src_instance and dest_instance information about the backend VM to its
report because it sends the request to and receives the response from the
IP address of the load balancer, not the backend VM.
VM flows through an internal proxy Network Load Balancer or internal Application Load Balancer
Traffic flows through an internal proxy Network Load Balancer
or internal Application Load Balancer are reported by client
VMs, as long as the client VM is in a subnet that has
VPC Flow Logs enabled. For example, a client VM with
the IP address 10.10.0.2 sends a request with 1,224 bytes to the load balancer
endpoint, 10.10.0.3 . The request then reaches a backend. In turn,
the backend responds to the request with a reply containing 5,342 bytes.
Both the request and the reply are recorded on the client VM. The logs from the
client VM are available in the Google Cloud project that the VM belongs to.

GKE flows
The following sections provide examples of how VPC Flow Logs
annotates GKE traffic from and to Pods.
Pod to ClusterIP flow
Pod to cluster IP flow (click to enlarge).
In this example, traffic is sent from client Pod ( 10.4.0.2 ) to cluster-service
( 10.0.32.2:80 ). The destination is resolved to the selected server Pod IP
address ( 10.4.0.3 ) on the target port ( 8080 ).
On node edges, the flow is sampled twice with the translated IP address and
port. For both sampling points, we will identify that the destination Pod is
backing service cluster-service on port 8080 , and annotate the record with
the Service details as well as the Pod details. In case the traffic is routed
to a Pod on the same node, the traffic doesn't leave the node and is not
sampled at all.
In this example, the following records are found.

GKE external LoadBalancer flows
External load balancer flows (click to enlarge).
Traffic from an external IP address to a GKE service
( 35.35.35.35 ) is routed to a node in the cluster— 10.0.12.2 in this
example—for routing. By default, external passthrough Network Load Balancers distribute traffic across
all nodes in the cluster, even those not running a relevant Pod. Traffic might
take extra hops to get to the relevant Pod. For more information, see
Networking outside the
cluster .
The traffic is then routed from the node ( 10.0.12.2 ) to the selected server
Pod ( 10.4.0.2 ). Both hops are logged because all node edges are sampled. In
case the traffic is routed to a Pod on the same node— 10.4.0.3 in this
example—the second hop wouldn't be logged because it doesn't leave the node.
The second hop is logged by both nodes' sampling points. For the first hop,
we identify the Service based on the load balancer IP and Service port ( 80 ).
For the second hop, we identify that the destination Pod is backing the Service
on the target port ( 8080 ).

GKE Ingress flows
Ingress flows (click to enlarge).
A connection from an external IP address to an Ingress destination is terminated
at the Cloud Load Balancing service. The connection is mapped to a NodePort
Service according to the URL. To serve the request, the load balancer
( 130.211.0.1 ) connects to one of the cluster nodes ( 10.0.12.2 ) for routing
using the service's NodePort. By default, when creating an Ingress object, the
GKE Ingress controller configures an
HTTP(S) load balancer that distributes traffic across all nodes in the cluster,
even those not running a relevant Pod. Traffic might take extra hops to get to
the relevant Pod. For more information, see
Networking outside the cluster .
The traffic is then routed from the node ( 10.0.12.2 ) to the selected server
Pod ( 10.4.0.2 ).
Both hops are logged because all node edges are sampled. For the first hop, we
identify the Service based on the Service's NodePort ( 60000 ). For the second
hop, we identify that the destination Pod is backing the Service on the target
port ( 8080 ). The second hop is logged by both nodes' sampling points.
However, in a case where the traffic is routed to a Pod on the same node
( 10.4.0.3 ), the second hop is not logged because the traffic didn't leave
the node.

GKE Ingress flows using container-native load balancing
Ingress flows using container-native load balancing (click to enlarge).
Requests from an external IP address to an Ingress destination that is using
container-native load balancing
are terminated at the load balancer. In this type of Ingress, Pods are
core objects for load balancing .
A request is then sent from the load balancer ( 130.211.0.1 ) directly to a
selected Pod ( 10.4.0.2 ). We identify that the destination Pod is backing the
Service on the target port (8080).

Pod to external flows
Pod to external flow (click to enlarge).
Traffic from a Pod ( 10.4.0.3 ) to an external IP ( 203.0.113.1 ) is modified by
IP masquerading so that the packets are sent from the node IP ( 10.0.12.2 )
instead of the Pod IP address. By default, the GKE cluster is configured
to masquerade traffic to external destinations. For more information, see
IP masquerade agent .
In order to view Pod annotations for this traffic, you can configure the
masquerade agent not to masquerade Pod IP addresses. In such a case, to allow traffic
to the internet, you can configure Cloud NAT, which processes the Pod IP
addresses. For more information about Cloud NAT with
GKE, review GKE
interaction .

Serverless flows
For serverless traffic, VPC Flow Logs annotates flows that are sent
through Cloud Run endpoints configured with Direct VPC egress.
For more information, see
ServerlessDetails field format .
Serverless-to-VM flows in the same VPC network
For serverless-to-VM flows in the same VPC network,
flow logs are reported from both requesting and responding resources, as long as
both resources are in subnets that have VPC Flow Logs enabled.
In this example, Cloud Run endpoint 10.10.0.2 sends a request
with 1,224 bytes to VM 10.50.0.2 . In turn, 10.50.0.2 responds to the request
with a reply containing 5,342 bytes. Both the request and reply are recorded
from both the requesting endpoint and responding VM.

Hybrid connectivity flows
For hybrid connectivity through VLAN attachments for
Cloud Interconnect and Cloud VPN tunnels,
VPC Flow Logs annotates the following flows:
Flows between VM instances, including instances used as GKE
nodes, and on-premises endpoints
Flows between Google services and on-premises
endpoints
Transit flows between on-premises endpoints
The following example describes how
VPC Flow Logs annotates flows between a VM instance in a
VPC network and an on-premises endpoint. The network is
connected to the endpoint through a VLAN attachment for
Cloud Interconnect.
VM-to-on-premises flows (click to enlarge).
For flows between a VM that's in a VPC network and an on-premises
endpoint with an internal IP address, flow logs are reported from
Google Cloud only. The following resources report flow logs:
The VM . Reports flow logs if the subnet that the VM is connected to has
VPC Flow Logs enabled.
The gateway that connects the
VPC network to the on-premises endpoint . Reports flow logs if
the gateway (in this example, the VLAN attachment) has
VPC Flow Logs enabled.
In the preceding diagram, the on-premises endpoint 10.30.0.2 sends a request
with 1,224 bytes to the VM 10.0.0.2 in the VPC network.
In turn, the VM 10.0.0.2 responds to the request
with a reply containing 5,243 bytes. Both the request and the reply are recorded
from both the VLAN attachment and the VM.

Flows between VPC networks in different projects
If VPC Flow Logs is configured for an organization and
cross-project annotations
are enabled (default), traffic flows between VPC networks in
different projects are annotated in the same way as traffic flows between
VPC networks in the same project; log records
for these flows provide information about both sides of the connection.
If cross-project annotations are disabled, log records provide information
only about the reporter of the traffic flow.
Cross-project annotations enabled
The following example describes how VPC Flow Logs
annotates log records for VM-to-VM flows between projects
when cross-project annotations are enabled. Cross-project annotations are
available for traffic flows through Shared VPC, VPC Network Peering,
and Network Connectivity Center.

VM 10.0.0.2 sends a request with 1,224 bytes to VM 10.0.0.1.2. In turn,
VM 10.0.0.1.2 responds to the request with a reply containing 5,342 bytes.
Both the request and reply are recorded from both the requesting and
responding VMs.

Cross-project annotations disabled
The following example describes how VPC Flow Logs
annotates log records for VM-to-VM flows between projects when
cross-project annotations are disabled.
VM 10.0.0.2 sends a request with 1,224 bytes to VM 10.0.0.1.2. In turn,
VM 10.0.0.1.2 responds to the request with a reply containing 5,342 bytes.
Both the request and reply are recorded from both the requesting and
responding VMs. However, information about the other VM isn't provided.
