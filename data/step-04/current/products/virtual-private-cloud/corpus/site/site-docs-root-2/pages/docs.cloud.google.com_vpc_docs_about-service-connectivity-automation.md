About service connectivity automation
Service connectivity automation lets service consumers automate the deployment
of connectivity to managed services.
Consider a database administrator who deploys a database instance and wants to
let service consumers to reach that database through a
Private Service Connect endpoint. The database administrator
might not have the required Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials or expertise
to deploy networking resources.
If a managed service supports service connectivity automation, the service
instance configuration and the networking configuration can be delegated to the
appropriate administrators:
Service instance administrators can control which networks can access
their services.
Network administrators can control which services they want to allow
connections to.
When these configurations match, service connectivity automation creates an
endpoint in the appropriate networks, providing connectivity to the managed
service instance.
Overview of service connectivity automation
The following section describes a basic configuration in a single
VPC network that uses service connectivity automation. For
information about other configurations, see Shared VPC
and Google services with custom service instance scope .
Deploying an instance of a managed service that supports service connectivity
automation involves the following steps:
A network administrator creates a service connection
policy for
their VPC network.
The service connection policy references a service
class —a globally unique resource that identifies a
specific producer service. A single service connection policy is scoped to a
single service class and a single consumer VPC network,
delegating the ability to configure connectivity within that scope.
A service instance administrator deploys a managed service instance
by using the service's administrative API or UI. The service instance
configuration specifies which networks can access the service
through service connectivity automation.
Service connectivity automation creates an endpoint in the consumer
VPC network. This endpoint can be used to send requests to
the service instance.

the deployment of connectivity to managed services (click to enlarge).
Producer configuration
The following sections describe resources that are used by service producers to
configure service connectivity automation.
Service classes
A service class is a globally unique representation of a managed service type.
Each producer exclusively owns their service class. Consumers reference the
service class in their service connection policies, which authorizes deployment
and delegates connectivity to the producer.
Service connection policies can only be created for services that have a service
class.
Service classes are available only for Google published services. For
more information, see Supported services .
Service connection maps
A service connection map is a producer-managed resource that stores details for
authorizing and establishing Private Service Connect connections
between consumer VPC networks and producer managed service
instances. This map defines the allowed relationships between producer service
instances (represented by service attachments) and the consumer projects and
VPC networks that are authorized to connect to the service
instances.
Authorization model
Service connection policies let consumers delegate the deployment of
connectivity to managed services. The service producer doesn't have direct
access or IAM privileges for the consumer project. Instead, the
producer configures a service connection map in their own project.
When the service connection map is created or updated, typically in response to
a request from a consumer service administrator to the managed service's
administrative API or UI, service connectivity automation performs a series of
authorization checks. If all of the checks pass,
Private Service Connect endpoints are created as specified in the
request.
Network configuration (service connection policy):
Network authorization . The consumer VPC network must
have a valid service connection policy that authorizes the
VPC network, region, and service class that is specified
by the request. This check helps to ensure that a consumer network
administrator with IAM permissions on the
VPC network explicitly delegates the ability to create
Private Service Connect endpoints for the specified service
type.
Service instance scope . If the managed service instance is a Google
service and the service connection policy specifies a custom service
instance scope ( custom-resource-hierarchy-levels ), then service
connectivity automation checks the list of Resource Manager
nodes that
are provided ( --allowed-google-producers-resource-hierarchy-level ).
The project that the service instance administrator specified in the
managed service's UI or API for deploying and managing the service
instance must be within the allowed scope defined by this list. The
scope can be a mix of organizations, folders, and projects.
Endpoint project validation . The project where the connection policy
is created must be associated with the VPC network where the
endpoint is to be created. The project must either contain the
VPC network or be a service project that is attached
to the Shared VPC network.
Service instance configuration:
Service administrator IAM authorization . The consumer
service administrator must have the IAM permissions that are
necessary to create or update the producer service instance. These
permissions vary based on the service that is being deployed.
Service instance administrator authorization . In the service's
administrative API, the service instance administrator who created the
service instance must have configured the instance to allow connections
from the VPC network that requests the connection.
Producer configuration:
Producer IAM permissions . The producer service
administrator who creates or updates the service connection map must
have IAM permissions on the associated service class.
This check helps prevent false representations of a public service class.
If each condition is met, the Network Connectivity Service
Account creates
the requested endpoints in the authorized networks. The Network Connectivity
Service Account is a service
agent .
Automatic retries for endpoint failures
Service connectivity automation fully manages the creation and deletion of your
Private Service Connect endpoints.
If service connectivity automation fails to create or delete an authorized
endpoint—for example, due to quota
limitations or the service connection policy's
subnet being out of IP addresses—an automated process periodically
retries the operation until the blocking issue is resolved. However, if
endpoint creation or deletion fails due to
authorization checks ,
the operation is not retried.
You can view
errors that block endpoint creation by
describing the service connection policy
and checking the pscConnections field. For information about troubleshooting
failures with endpoint creation or deletion, see
Troubleshooting .
Shared VPC
Service connectivity automation can be used to automatically create
Private Service Connect endpoints in Shared VPC networks.
Because the endpoint is configured with an IP address from the
Shared VPC network, the endpoint is accessible from the host project and
all attached service projects.
To create the configuration shown in the following diagram, the following
tasks are completed:
The network administrator creates a service connection policy for the
vpc1 network in the project1 host project, and allows connectivity to
service instances that use the google-cloud-sql service class. Endpoint IP
addresses are allocated from the endpoint-subnet subnet.
The service instance administrator deploys two managed service instances:
db-test in the service-project-test project, and db-prod in the
service-project-prod project. The administrator configures the service
instance to let service connectivity automation deploy endpoints in network
vpc1 in project1 that connect to the service instances.
Because the authorization checks all pass, service
connectivity automation creates two endpoints that are connected to
endpoint-subnet , one for each service instance. All VMs that
are connected to the vm-subnet subnet can access the endpoints because
they are connected to the same Shared VPC network as the endpoints.
Note: In this example, the service instance configuration specifies that
the endpoints are created in the host project. Specifying a service project
is also supported.
You can use a service connection policy in a
Shared VPC network to create connectivity to service instances
that are deployed in service projects (click to enlarge).
Services with custom service instance scope support
By default, service connectivity automation requires that the service instance
and the endpoints that connect to the service instance must be in the same
project (or in the case of Shared VPC, in connected projects). If a
service supports custom service instance scope, service instances and connecting
endpoints can be in different projects or organizations.
To create the configuration shown in the following diagram, the following tasks
are completed:
The network administrators for vpc-1 , vpc-2 , and vpc-3 create service
connection policies in their respective VPC networks. They
allow connectivity to service instances that use the google-cloud-sql
service class and are deployed in project project-1 in organization
org-1 .
The service instance administrator deploys a managed service instance db-1
in project-1 by using the service's administrative API or UI. The
administrator configures the service instance to let service connectivity
automation deploy endpoints in vpc-1 and vpc-2 that connect to db-1 .
For vpc-1 and vpc-2 , the authorization checks all pass
and service connectivity automation creates an endpoint in each network. VMs
in those networks can send traffic to the service instance through the
endpoints.
However, an endpoint isn't created in vpc-3 because that network isn't
configured for automatic connectivity in the db-1 service instance
configuration.
If vpc-3 needs to access the db-1 service instance, the network
administrator can contact the database administrator and ask them to add
vpc-3 to the connectivity configuration for db-1 .
You can automate connectivity to supported Google services from
different projects, folders, or organizations (click to enlarge).
