Publish services by using Private Service Connect
As a service producer, you can use
Private Service Connect to publish
services using internal IP addresses in your VPC network. Your
published services are accessible to service consumers by using internal IP
addresses in the consumer VPC networks.
This guide describes how to use Private Service Connect to
publish a service. To publish a service, do the following:
Create a target service, which can be one of the following:
The forwarding rule of a supported load balancer with a supported
configuration
A Secure Web Proxy instance
Create a service
attachment
that points to the target service.
Private Service Connect provides two methods to connect to published
services:
Endpoints (based on a forwarding rule)
Backends (based on a load balancer)
These endpoint types require slightly different producer configurations. For
more information, see Features and compatibility .
Roles
The following IAM role provides
the permissions needed to perform the tasks in this guide.
Compute Network Admin
( roles/compute.networkAdmin )
Before you begin
Read About published services for
information about publishing services, including limitations.
Decide whether the service should be accessible from all
projects , or if you want to control which projects
can access your service .
Decide whether you want this service to support endpoints, backends, or
both. For more information about endpoints and backends, see
Private Service Connect
types .
For more information about the service configuration requirements, see
Features and
compatibility .
Decide if you want to configure a domain name for the
service , which automates DNS
configuration for service consumer endpoints. If you do configure a domain
name, the same IAM principal that publishes the service must
verify that they have Owner permissions for the domain in the
Google Search Console. If you configure a domain name, but you
don't own the domain, publishing the service fails. To verify ownership, go
to the Google Search
Console .
The domain name that you specify in the service attachment can be a
subdomain of the domain that you verify. For example, you can verify
example.com and then create a service attachment with a domain name of
us-west1.p.example.com .
Decide whether your service will use
PROXY protocol to
provide details about consumers' connections.
If you plan to use PROXY protocol, make sure that it's supported by both
your target service type and the service's backend web server software.
For information about the types of target services
that support PROXY protocol, see
Features and compatibility .
Create a target service
To host the service, create one of the following target services in a service
producer VPC network:
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Cross-region internal Application Load Balancer
Internal protocol forwarding
Regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer
Secure Web Proxy instance
For information about supported configurations for each target service, see
Features and
compatibility .
A service attachment can have only one target service. However, multiple
service attachments can share the same target service.
The IP version of your target service
(IPv4 or IPv6) affects which consumers can connect to your published service.
For more information, see
IP version translation .
For regional internal proxy Network Load Balancers, the backends can be located in
Google Cloud, in other clouds, in an on-premises environment, or any
combination of these locations.
You can also publish a service that is hosted on an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer on
Google Kubernetes Engine. This configuration, including load balancer and
service attachment configuration, is described in Create an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer with
Private Service Connect
in the GKE documentation.
Create a subnet for Private Service Connect
Create one or more dedicated subnets to use with
Private Service Connect. You must create the subnet in the same
region as the service's load balancer.
If you're using the Google Cloud console to publish a
service , you can create the subnets during that
procedure.
You can create a Private Service Connect subnet in a
Shared VPC host project.
You can't convert a regular subnet to a Private Service Connect
subnet.
The IP stack type of the subnet that you create must be compatible with the IP
version of your load balancer's forwarding rule:
For IPv4 forwarding rules, create an IPv4-only or dual-stack subnet.
For IPv6 forwarding rules, create an IPv6-only
or dual-stack subnet
that has an internal IPv6 address range .
If you use a dual-stack subnet, either the IPv4 or IPv6
address range is used, but not both.
If you need to make more IP addresses available to an existing service, see
Add or remove subnets from a published service .
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or one of the following IAM roles.
Permissions

subnet—for example, 10.10.10.0/24 .
API
Send a POST request to the
subnetworks.insert method .
To create an IPv4-only Private Service Connect subnet, do
the following:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /subnetworks
{
"ipCidrRange": " SUBNET_RANGE ",
"name": " SUBNET_NAME ",
"network": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME ",
"purpose": "PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT"
}
To create a dual-stack Private Service Connect subnet, do
the following:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /subnetworks
{
"ipCidrRange": " SUBNET_RANGE ",
"name": " SUBNET_NAME ",
"network": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME ",
"purpose": "PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT",
"stackType": "IPV4_IPV6",
"ipv6AccessType": "INTERNAL"
}
To create an IPv6-only Private Service Connect subnet, do
the following:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /subnetworks
{
"name": " SUBNET_NAME ",
"network": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME ",
"purpose": "PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT",
"stackType": "IPV6_ONLY",
"ipv6AccessType": "INTERNAL"
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for the subnet.
REGION : the region for the new subnet. This must be
the same region as the service you are publishing.
SUBNET_RANGE : the IPv4 address range to use for the
subnet. For example, 10.10.10.0/24 .
SUBNET_NAME : the name to assign to the
subnet.
NETWORK_NAME : the name of the VPC
network for the new subnet.
Configure firewall rules
Your network configuration must allow traffic from appropriate source IP
address ranges to the instances or network endpoints that are configured as
backends for your backend services. If your service uses health checks, you must
also allow traffic from the health check probes to your backends.
You don't need to take any steps to allow traffic between a
Private Service Connect endpoint or
Private Service Connect backend and the associated
service attachment, or between a service attachment and the associated load
balancer. Endpoints, backends, and service attachments are
logical components that don't participate in the flow of traffic .
If your backends are in a VPC network, you can use
VPC ingress firewall rules or firewall policies to allow this
traffic. For backends that are on-premises or in another cloud, configure that
environment to allow traffic to the backends.
When you configure ingress firewall rules for backend services, the source of
traffic depends on the type of load balancer that your service uses:
Category
Source of traffic to backends
Passthrough load balancers:
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
Internal protocol forwarding
Port mapping service
The IP address ranges of the Private Service Connect
(NAT) subnets associated with the service
Proxy load balancers:
Cross-region internal Application Load Balancer
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer
Secure Web Proxy
The IP address ranges of the associated proxy-only subnets
Services with health checks
The probe IP address ranges of your load balancer type
Publish a service
To publish a service, you create a service attachment. You can make the service
available in one of two ways:
You can publish a service with automatic approval .
You can publish a service with explicit approval .
Create the service attachment in the same region as the service's load
balancer.
Each service attachment can point to one or more
Private Service Connect subnets, but a
Private Service Connect subnet cannot be used in more than one
service attachment.
If you want to view consumer connection information, you can enable PROXY
protocol on supported services. Only enable PROXY protocol if it's supported
by both your target
service type ( known issue ) and the service's backend web
server software. For information about the types of target services that support
PROXY protocol, see
Features and compatibility .
For more information about PROXY protocol, see Consumer connection
information .
The following sections provide instructions for publishing a service that's
based on a load balancer. For information about creating a service attachment
that refers to a Secure Web Proxy instance, see
Deploy Secure Web Proxy as a Private Service Connect service attachment .
Publish a service with automatic approval
Use these instructions to publish a service and automatically let any consumer
connect to this service. If you want to approve consumer connections explicitly,
see publishing a service with explicit approval .
When you publish a service, you create a service attachment. Service consumers
use the service attachment details to connect to your service.
When you publish a service with automatic approval, the propagated connection
limit applies to each consumer project that connects to your service
attachment.

Publish a service with explicit approval
Use these instructions to publish a service if you want to explicitly approve
consumers before they can connect to this service. If you want to approve
consumer connections automatically, see publishing a service with automatic
approval .
When you publish a service, you create a service attachment. Service consumers
use the service attachment details to connect to your service.
Each service attachment has a
consumer accept list and a consumer reject list .
The consumer lists determine which endpoints can connect to the service. A
given service attachment can accept or reject consumers based on one of the
following types:
Project
VPC network
Private Service Connect endpoint
Each entry in the consumer lists must be of the same type. For example, a given
service attachment can't accept some consumers based on project and some
based on VPC network. Additionally, specifying consumers by
folder is not supported.
If you add a value to both the accept list and the reject list,
connection requests from that consumer are rejected.
To accept users based on individual Private Service Connect endpoints,
publish a service with explicit approval, but don't add any values to the
consumer lists. After a consumer connects to your service attachment, you can
find the endpoint's ID-based URI by
describing the service attachment
or asking the consumer to
describe the endpoint .
To accept the connection,
add the Private Service Connect endpoint's ID-based URI to your service's consumer accept list .
If your consumer accept and reject lists refer to projects or individual
endpoints, the propagated connection limit applies to consumer projects. If your
consumer accept and reject lists refer to VPC networks, the
propagated connection limit applies to consumer VPC networks.

Known issues
Health check failures with global access consumer endpoints
Consumers can connect a global access
endpoint to a published service that's
not configured for global access. However, health checks don't work correctly
in this configuration. As a result, traffic might be sent to unhealthy backends
and dropped.
If you publish a service by using an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer or internal protocol
forwarding (target instance), and your service is affected by this issue, do
the following.
If you want to use global access, do the following:
Enable global access for the load balancer's forwarding rule .
If the load balancer is managed by Google Kubernetes Engine, you must also update
the corresponding Service manifest and apply it to your cluster. For more
information about this GKE-specific configuration, see
Global access .
Update any automation so that new producer load balancers that
support global access Private Service Connect endpoints are
configured for global access.
If you don't want to use global access, ask the consumer to
disable global access for the endpoint .
Turning on global access for a published service doesn't interrupt network
traffic.
Health check failures with global access Private Service Connect NEGs
There is a known issue with consumer Private Service Connect NEGs
that are configured for global access. A Private Service Connect NEG
is configured for global access if it's associated with a
global backend service .
If a consumer connects a Private Service Connect NEG that is configured
for global access to a producer load balancer, and the service producer disables
global access for that load balancer, health checks don't work correctly. As a
result, traffic might be sent to unhealthy backends and dropped.
If you publish a service by using an internal load balancer that supports
global access, and your service is affected by this issue, do the following.
If you want to use global access, do the following:
Enable global access
for the load balancer's forwarding rule.
If the load balancer is managed by Google Kubernetes Engine, you must also
update the corresponding Service manifest and apply it to your cluster.
For more information about this GKE-specific
configuration, see
Global access .
Update any automation so that new producer load balancers that
support global access Private Service Connect NEGs are
configured for global access.
If you don't want to use global access, ask the consumer to reconfigure
the Private Service Connect NEG for regional access. To do this,
the consumer must
remove their Private Service Connect NEG from the global backend service
and then attach the NEG to a regional backend service .
Turning on global access for a published service doesn't interrupt network
traffic.
Disconnections after upgrading the Google provider for Terraform
If you've used the Google provider for Terraform with versions earlier than
4.76.0 to create service attachments, don't upgrade to versions 4.76.0 through
4.81.x. When you run terraform apply after upgrading to versions 4.76.0
through 4.81.x, Terraform might unintentionally delete and recreate the service
attachments and close existing Private Service Connect
connections. Recreated service attachments don't automatically re-establish
Private Service Connect connections.
If you upgrade to version 4.82.0 and then run terraform apply , your service
attachments are not deleted, but the reconcile
connections
setting is set to true. If the setting was previously set to false, some
Private Service Connect connections might close.
Upgrading to Google provider versions 4.76.0 through 4.81.x. In this
scenario, the output of terraform plan includes the following:
-/+ resource "google_compute_service_attachment" " SERVICE_NAME " {
...
~ reconcile_connections = false -> true # forces replacement
...
Caution: If you ignore this warning and apply the changes, Terraform deletes and
recreate the service attachment. All existing
Private Service Connect connections are closed, and new
connections are not automatically re-established.
Use the workaround to prevent this issue.
Upgrading to Google provider versions 4.82.0. In this scenario, the
output of terraform plan includes the following:
~ reconcile_connections = false -> true
If you ignore this warning and apply the changes, Terraform updates the
service attachment to turn on connection reconciliation. Depending on their
connection status, changing from false to true might close some existing
connections. For more information, see Connection
reconciliation .
Use the workaround to prevent this issue.
Workaround
We recommend that you upgrade the Google provider for Terraform to version
4.82.0 or
later .
This version prevents the unintentional deletion and recreation of service
attachments.
If you can't upgrade immediately, or if you can upgrade but you also want to
prevent Terraform from changing the connection reconciliation setting, update
your Terraform configuration to explicitly set the connection reconciliation
setting.
View the detailed configuration for the service attachment, and note the
reconcileConnections setting.
gcloud compute service-attachments describe SERVICE_NAME --region= REGION
The output includes the reconcileConnections field, which can be true or
false.
reconcileConnections: false
Update your Terraform configuration file to explicitly use the same setting
that is used on the service attachment.
resource "google_compute_service_attachment" " SERVICE_NAME " {
...
reconcile_connections = false
}
For an example configuration, see Service Attachment

TLS errors with PROXY protocol
If you publish a service with PROXY protocol enabled, but your target service
type doesn't support PROXY protocol, consumers can connect to your service with
endpoints. However, traffic doesn't flow through the connection, and workloads
receive errors related to TLS.
To resolve this issue, update the service attachment to disable PROXY
protocol.
For information about the types of target services that support PROXY protocol,
see Features and compatibility .
Troubleshooting
Error when updating a service attachment
If you see the following error message when you update a service attachment, the
accept list or the reject list might include deleted projects: The
resource PROJECT was not found .
Remove the deleted projects from the service attachment configuration to resolve
the issue.
Use the gcloud compute service-attachments describe command to show the
configuration of the service attachment that you want to modify.
To output the accept list in a format you can use later to update the
service attachment, do the following:
gcloud compute service-attachments describe ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION --flatten="consumerAcceptLists[]" \
--format="csv[no-heading,separator='='](consumerAcceptLists.projectIdOrNum,consumerAcceptLists.connectionLimit)" \
| xargs | sed -e 's/ /,/g'
The accept list output looks similar to the following:
PROJECT_1 = LIMIT_1 , PROJECT_2 = LIMIT_2 , PROJECT_3 = LIMIT_3
To output the reject list in a format you can use later to update the
service attachment, do the following:
gcloud compute service-attachments describe ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--format="value[delimiter=','](consumerRejectLists[])"
The reject list output looks similar to the following:
PROJECT_1 , PROJECT_2 , PROJECT_3
Edit the command output to remove any deleted projects from the accept list
and the reject list.
Update the service attachment to remove the deleted projects.
To update the accept list, do the following:
gcloud compute service-attachments update ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--consumer-accept-list= UPDATED_ACCEPT_LIST
To update the reject list, do the following:
gcloud compute service-attachments update ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--consumer-reject-list= UPDATED_REJECT_LIST
Connectivity is not established
If a consumer has created an endpoint or backend that refers to your service
attachment but connectivity is not established, check the service attachment's
connection status .
The connection status might indicate steps that you can take to resolve the
issue.
Consumer connections time out
If consumer connections time out, check if your service requires long-running
connections. The TCP Established Connection Idle Timeout for
Private Service Connect NAT is 20 minutes. If your service needs
a longer timeout, you might need to make some configuration changes to help
ensure that the connections don't time out. For more information, see
NAT specifications .
Propagated connection errors
For information about troubleshooting propagated connections, see
Troubleshoot Private Service Connect connection propagation
errors .
Published service has performance issues or connection timeouts
If your published service has performance issues or intermittent connection
timeouts, it might be due to dropped packets. You can investigate dropped
packets by checking the metrics that are described in the following sections.
Dropped packets from consumers
The private_service_connect/producer/dropped_received_packets_count metric tracks packets from an endpoint or
backend to a published service that are dropped because the endpoint or backend
exceeded its
maximum connections to
the service.
If a published service reports values for this metric, consider the following
solutions:
Increase the capacity of your published service—for example, by adding
more virtual machine (VM) instances or network endpoints.
Ask the service consumer to create additional endpoints or backends that
connect to the published service.
Ask the service consumer to reduce the number of connections through their
endpoint or backend.
Dropped packets to consumers
The
private_service_connect/producer/dropped_sent_packets_count metric
tracks packets sent from a published service to an endpoint or backend that are
dropped because Private Service Connect can't find a matching
connection for response packets.
Private Service Connect only allows connections that are
initiated from the consumer VPC network. When a consumer
initiates a connection, the connection is tracked in order to match
response packets from the published service with an existing connection. If
Private Service Connect can't find a match for a response packet,
the packet is dropped.
This might happen if a published service sends response packets after a
connection has timed out. For information about avoiding issues with
connections timing out, see
NAT specifications .
