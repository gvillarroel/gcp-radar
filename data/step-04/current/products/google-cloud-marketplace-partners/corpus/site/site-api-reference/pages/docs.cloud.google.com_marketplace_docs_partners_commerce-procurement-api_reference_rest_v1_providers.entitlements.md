Output only. The identifier of the service provider that this entitlement was created against. Each service provider is assigned a unique provider value when they onboard with Cloud Commerce platform.
product (deprecated)
string

If the entitlement is in the state ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVATION_REQUESTED, this field is populated with the upcoming offer.
If the entitlement is in the state ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE, ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION, ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE, or ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE_APPROVAL, this field is populated with the current offer.
If the entitlement is in the state ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED, then this field is populated with the latest offer that the order was associated with.
newPendingOffer

If the entitlement is in the state ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE or ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION, then this field is populated with the expected end time of the current offer, in the future. This field's value is set regardless of whether the offer has a specific end date or a duration. This means that this field and the field offer_duration can both exist.
If the entitlement is in the state ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE_APPROVAL or ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE:
If the entitlement's pricing model is usage based and the associated offer is a private offer whose term has ended, then this field reflects the ACTUAL end time of the entitlement's associated offer (in the past), even though the entitlement associated with this private offer does not terminate at the end of that private offer's term.

Possible values include "unknown", "expired", "user-cancelled", "account-closed", "billing-disabled" (if the customer has manually disabled billing to their resources), "user-aborted", and "migrated" (if the entitlement has migrated across products). Values of this field are subject to change, and we recommend that you don't build your technical integration to rely on these fields.
EntitlementState
Indicates the current state of an entitlement.
Enums
ENTITLEMENT_STATE_UNSPECIFIED
Default state of the entitlement. It's only set to this value when the entitlement is first created and has not been initialized.
ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVATION_REQUESTED
Indicates that the entitlement has been created, but it hasn't yet become active. The entitlement remains in this state until it becomes active.
If the entitlement requires provider approval, a notification is sent to the provider for the activation approval. If the provider doesn't approve, the entitlement is removed. If approved, the entitlement transitions to the EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE state after either a short processing delay or, if applicable, at the scheduled start time of the purchased offer.
Plan changes aren't allowed in this state. Instead, customers are expected to cancel the corresponding order and place a new order.
ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE
Indicates that the entitlement is active. The procured item is now usable and any associated billing events will start occurring. Entitlements in this state WILL renew. The analogous state for an unexpired but non-renewing entitlement is ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION.
In this state, the customer can decide to cancel the entitlement, which would change the state to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION , and then EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED .
The user can also request a change of plan, which will transition the state to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE , and then back to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE .
ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION
Indicates that the entitlement will expire at the end of its term. This could mean the customer has elected not to renew this entitlement or the customer elected to cancel an entitlement that only expires at term end.
The entitlement typically stays in this state if the entitlement/plan allows use of the underlying resource until the end of the current billing cycle. Once the billing cycle completes, the resource will transition to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED state.
The resource cannot be modified during this state.
ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED
Indicates that the entitlement was cancelled. The entitlement can now be deleted.
ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE
Indicates that the entitlement is currently active, but there is a pending plan change that is requested by the customer. The entitlement typically stays in this state, if the entitlement/plan requires the completion of the current billing cycle before the plan can be changed. Once the billing cycle completes, the resource will transition to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE , with its plan changed.
ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE_APPROVAL
Indicates that the entitlement is currently active, but there is a plan change request pending provider approval. If the provider approves the plan change, then the entitlement will transition either to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE or EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE depending on whether current plan requires that the billing cycle completes.
If the provider rejects the plan change, then the pending plan change request is removed and the entitlement stays in EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE state with the old plan.
ENTITLEMENT_SUSPENDED
Indicates that the entitlement is suspended either by Google or provider request.
This can be triggered for various external reasons (e.g. expiration of credit card on the billing account, violation of terms-of-service of the provider etc.). As such, any remediating action needs to be taken externally, before the entitlement can be activated.
This is not yet supported.
Consumer
A resource using (consuming) this entitlement.
