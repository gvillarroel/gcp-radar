Add your AI agent's pricing information
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
After you've added your AI agent in Producer Portal, use the
Pricing tab in Producer Portal to complete the following
steps:
Add pricing information for your AI agent's Google Cloud Marketplace listing.
Submit your AI agent's pricing information to Google for review. To publish
your AI agent, you must have successfully completed the Pricing review.
Because pricing models take up to four business days to process, we recommend
that you decide on a pricing model and submit it for review before you complete
the remaining technical integration steps.
For details about the available pricing models for AI agents, see
Pricing models for AI agents .

Best practices for defining pricing
For best results when defining pricing, consider the following best practices:
Give your plans names that directly reflect what they offer. Avoid generic
terms, such as "test plan" or "new plan".
Keep your plans' names under 58 characters. You can use hyphens ( - ) and
spaces, but not other special characters.
Don't define your pricing as $0. When you define private subscription plans,
use only non-zero values.
Use names that are clear for customers to understand for your metering units
and reporting units. Avoid generic terms, like "unit" or "token".
Don't include separate line items for professional services (setup, support,
maintenance) or hardware.
Don't offer "proof of concept" free plans.
Your products must be production-ready, and not alpha or beta versions.
Your pricing plans must each have at least one defined feature. Feature
names can be up to 128 characters long.
Add features to your plans
After you add your pricing details, you can add features to specific plans by
using the Features tab of the Pricing details section. For each
combination of a feature and a plan, you can choose Yes , No , N/A ,
or input a custom value, to indicate the level of support for that feature
by the plan.
Answer tax category questions
After you add features to your pricing plans, you use the Tax category tab
of the Pricing details section to answer questions about your product.
Your answers to these questions help Google categorize your product for tax
purposes. This information is captured to ensure accurate withholding and
reporting on your earned income.
Adding an end user license agreement (EULA)
Add an end user license agreement (EULA) in the Terms & Policies tab. We
recommend that you use the Google standard EULA if your product allows it.
This may help users adopt your product more quickly.
If your product requires a specialized EULA, add your EULA's URL to the
EULA URL field.
Submit your pricing model for review
When you're ready to submit your pricing model for processing, click Submit .
You can't modify your pricing model while it's under review.
Update the price of products after launch
If it's been at least 30 days after your pricing model has been published and
approved, you can update the price of your product. To update the price of your
product, use Producer Portal .
In Producer Portal, complete the following steps:
In the list of products, click the name of your product.
Go to the pricing section of your product.
Click Edit content .
Make your updates to your pricing.
When you're done, click Submit price model .
Your product's price is updated after the new pricing is reviewed and approved.
Price updates take up to four business days to be reviewed and take effect. If
you're decreasing your price, your price decrease doesn't require any additional
waiting period. If you're increasing your price, it takes an additional 45 days
for the price increase to take effect after the Operations team confirms that
they've received your request. This time window includes 15 days to draft and
send a message to active users, and 30 days for users to review the price
change.
Note: Sometimes, Google changes the questions that we ask in the
Tax category section of Producer Portal. If we've changed the
questions since the last time you submitted your product's pricing for review,
then when you update your product's pricing, you must re-review the
Tax category questions and adjust your answers as needed.
Delete a pricing plan
If you want to delete a pricing plan in Producer Portal, you must
make sure that it has no entitlements associated with it, including both active
and cancelled entitlements. This means that you can't delete a pricing plan on
your own if it has previously been purchased.
To delete a plan that has entitlements associated with it, contact your Google
Partner Engineer.
