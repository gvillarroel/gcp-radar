Add pricing information to a config
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
After you add your data product
in Producer Portal, you create one or more configs and add product
and pricing details to prepare them for publication.
Note: Configs are editable draft representations of how you plan to offer your
product through Cloud Marketplace, including product and pricing details.
For more details, see the
overview of configs .
For information about available pricing options for data products, see
Pricing models for data products .
Add your pricing information in Producer Portal
To add pricing details to a config, you use Producer Portal.
The direct link to Producer Portal is:
https://console.cloud.google.com/producer-portal?project= YOUR_PROJECT_ID
Note: If you don't see the link, or can't access the URL, verify that you've
selected the correct project. If you still can't access the URL, use the
Partner Support Desk to request assistance,
and include the word "Marketplace" in your description. For more information
about Partner Support Desk, visit
Request assistance with Cloud Marketplace .
In Producer Portal, select your data product and complete the
following steps:
A list of configs appears. Click the name of the config that you want to
edit.
On the Overview page of your product, go to the Pricing section and
click Edit .
Set up your pricing plans
For each pricing plan that you want to support, add a new plan:
Under Plan title , provide a name for your plan. This is visible to your
customers in Cloud Marketplace.
Under Service level , provide a unique identifier for your plan, which
should be 58 characters or shorter. This serves as the reference identifier
for the plan within the product. Use a name which your customers can clearly
distinguish from the names of your other plans. Ideally, this name directly
reflects what the plan offers.
Add specific pricing information to your pricing plans
When you create or edit a pricing plan, you add specific pricing information in
the form of subscription periods.
Subscription-based pricing
For subscription-based pricing plans, complete the following steps:
Under Add subscriptions , specify how long you want subscription
periods to last for.
In the corresponding Price field, enter how much you want to charge
your customers per subscription period.
Free products
For data products that you're offering with a free pricing plan, complete
the following steps:
Under Add subscriptions , for Subscription period 1 , select how
long you want subscription periods to last.
In the corresponding Price field, enter 0 .
Manage how customers can purchase your plans
When you create or edit a pricing plan, you can also manage how customers can
purchase it. Under Manage procurement options , you can specify whether you
want a plan to be available for standard purchase, private offers, or both.
Caution: After you've published your data product, you can't remove support for
types of transactions (such as standard offers or private offers) that you've
previously supported.
Add features to your pricing plans
For each of your pricing plans that supports private offers, under
Add features , add at least one feature. Cloud Marketplace uses these
features to customize what capabilities this plan provides for private offers.
You can't add features to pricing plans that don't support private offers.
Delete a pricing plan
To delete a pricing plan in Producer Portal, you must make sure
that it isn't available for purchase and that it has no customers with active
orders.
What's next
Submit your data product for review and
publish it to
Cloud Marketplace.
Review the available
pricing models for data products .
