Pricing models for AI agents from Google Cloud Marketplace
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
For AI agents that you offer through Google Cloud Marketplace, you can choose from the
following pricing models:
Free : Customers only pay for the Google Cloud resources that they
use.
Subscription-based pricing : Customers pay a flat monthly fee for using
your AI agent. For partial months, the cost is prorated.
Usage-based pricing : Customers pay for your AI agent based on
measurements that you choose, called metrics . If you choose a usage-based
pricing model, then your product must measure and report usage information
to Google.
Combined pricing : Customers pay a base subscription fee for using your
AI agent, and additional charges based on their usage.
For any pricing model you choose, you can also
offer a free trial of your product .
Because pricing models take up to four business days to process, we recommend
that you decide on a pricing model and
submit it for review
before you complete the remaining technical integration steps.
If your pricing model includes any generic units that measure usage, you must
include a list of all usage sub-metrics that might count towards consumption of
the generic unit, and information about the conversion rate and pricing of each
of those sub-metrics.
You can have up to 24 total pricing plans for each product. If your pricing
model is based on usage, each plan can measure eight metrics. If you need more
plans, or need to track more metrics, contact your Google Partner Engineer.
You can also create customized quotes for specific customers. For example, if
you offer a subscription-based Standard plan for $100 per month, you can create
a custom quote that gives your customer the same plan for $50 per month. For
steps to create a custom quote, see
Creating private offers for specific customers .
Subscription-based pricing
In a subscription-based pricing model, customers are charged a flat monthly
rate. For partial months, the price is prorated. You can use a
subscription-based pricing model if you set your price by non-variable
measurements, such as the number of seats of service.
You can offer your product with different sets of features and levels of
service. For example, you might have Standard, Pro, and Enterprise plans for
your product, with progressively advanced features. You define the service
levels that you plan to offer when you
submit your pricing for review .
By default, you set up subscription plans with monthly billing. Optionally, your
plans can include a customized subscription period , where you can offer users
a different price if they sign up for a specific time period, such as a year. If
users choose a monthly plan, then their subscription automatically renews at the
end of every month. However, if your customers sign up for the customized
subscription period, then their subscription ends at the end of that period, and
they must subscribe to your product again.
In a subscription-based pricing model, if customers want to make changes
to their plans, then the effect and timing of those changes depends on their
current subscription plan:
For monthly subscriptions, customers can upgrade or downgrade between
service levels, or cancel their subscription entirely. By default,
customer-canceled subscriptions terminate at the end of the current billing month.
If your customers sign up for a specific subscription period, then they can change
their subscription plan to increase their service level or subscription
period, such as:
Switch from a shorter subscription period to a longer period, within
the same service level. For example, customers can switch from a Standard
monthly plan to a Standard 1-year plan.
Upgrade from a lower to a higher service level, with the same or a longer
subscription period. For example, customers can upgrade from a Standard
1-year plan to a Pro 1-year plan.
A combination of both of the previously described options.
In these scenarios, customers switch to their new plan immediately.
If customers have signed up for a specific subscription period and then
shorten their subscription period, downgrade to a lower service level,
or cancel their subscription, the change takes effect at the end of their
current subscription period. For example, if a customer is on a Standard
1-year plan and wants to switch to a Standard monthly plan, the change takes
effect after the one year is complete.
To set up subscription-based pricing, you must provide the subscription plans
that you offer, such as Standard or Enterprise, and the features that are
included in those plans. For example, the following pricing model offers
three subscription plans, with access to different features in each plan:
Standard
Pro
Enterprise
$9.99 / month
$39.99 / month
$99.99 / month

The following pricing model modifies the previous example, adding discounted
prices if customers sign up for one-year or three-year subscriptions.

Enterprise
Monthly subscription: $9.99 / month
One-year subscription: $7.49 / month
Three-year subscription: $5.99 / month
Monthly subscription: $39.99 / month
One-year subscription: $29.99 / month
Three-year subscription: $19.99 / month
Monthly subscription: $99.99 / month
One-year subscription: $89.99 / month
Three-year subscription: $74.99 / month

Usage-based pricing
You can charge your customers using measurements that apply to your product,
called metrics . A typical example of a metric is the time for which customers
use your product. For example, you can charge $0.05 per hour of use. Similarly,
you can charge customers by the quantity of data processed by your product, or
by the number of API requests that customers make.
While you are choosing your metrics, you must also choose a reporting unit
for each metric, which represents the granularity with which you measure your
product's usage.
For example, consider a product for which you charge $0.256 per gibibyte
(1024 mebibytes) of data processed, and your reporting unit is by mebibyte. If a
user processes 512 mebibytes of data, they are charged
(512 Mib / 1024 MiB) * $0.256 , or $0.128 , for their usage. However, if
your reporting unit is by gibibyte, the customer's usage is reported as 1 GiB ,
and they are charged the full $0.256, even if they only use a fraction of a
gibibyte.
The following table includes examples of the types of metrics that you can use,
and the reporting units that we recommend:
Metric type
Supported units
Recommended reporting unit
Example price, shown on your Cloud Marketplace page
Time
Second, minute, hour, day
1 second (smallest possible)
$5 per hour
Data processed
Byte, Kibibyte (KiB), Mebibyte (MiB), Gibibyte (GiB)
The units for data processed are based on binary multiples, where
one kibibyte is 1024 bytes, one mebibyte is 1024 kibibytes, and one
gibibyte is 1024 mebibytes.
1 Mebibyte
$10 per GiB
Storage time
See units for time and data
1 Mebibyte-second
$10 per GiB-hour
Custom metric
N/A. You define the unit you want to measure, such as API
request .
Depends on metric.
$10 per 1000 API requests
If you want to charge by a custom metric, ensure that the measurement is
a delta metric, where each usage report represents the change in the value
since the previous report. For example, you can set a price per email, and
every hourly usage report represents the number of emails sent in the previous
hour.
Defining your pricing structure
For usage-based pricing, you select one of the following options:
Single rate : Customers pay a set price for their usage, and the
charges increase in direct proportion to their usage.
For example, if you charge $0.50 per hour of usage, and a customer uses
your product for 20 hours, they are charged $10.
The following is an example pricing model with three pricing plans,
each with on-demand pricing and a different set of features:
Standard
Pro
Enterprise
$0.002 per email sent
$0.004 per email sent
$0.006 per email sent

Tiered pricing : If you want to give customers discounts for continued
usage, you can create pricing tiers. The tiers apply over the course of a
billing month. At the start of a new billing month, the price is reset to the
first tier. You can define tiers for each metric that you base your price on.
The following is an example of a pricing model with three pricing plans,
each with tiered pricing:
Standard
Pro
Enterprise
$0.002 per email sent for 0-1000 emails
$0.001 per email sent for 1001-2000 emails
$0.0001 per email sent for 2001+ emails
$0.005 per email sent for 0-1000 emails
$0.004 per email sent for 1001-2000 emails
$0.002 per email sent for 2001+ emails
$0.008 per email sent for 0-1000 emails
$0.006 per email sent for 1001-2000 emails
$0.003 per email sent for 2001+ emails

When a new billing month starts, the price is reset to the first tier.
You can define separate sets of tiers for each metric that you base your price
on.
Combined pricing
In a combined pricing model, customers pay a base subscription fee for using
your software, and additional charges based on their usage. You can include a
specific quantity of usage in your base fee. For example, the following
pricing model has base subscription plans that include a number of API
requests, and additional charges as customers increase their usage:
Standard
Pro
Enterprise
$9.99 / month subscription fee
$0 per request for 1000 API requests
$0.002 per request for 1000+ API requests
$39.99 / month subscription fee
$0 per request for 2000 API requests
$0.005 per request for 2000+ API requests
$99.99 / month subscription fee
$0 per request for 10000 API requests
$0.008 per request for 10000+ API requests

Offering trial software (Optional)
The process to offer a free trial of your software to Google Cloud users
involves using Producer Portal to specify:
The trial period, in days (for example, 30 days).
The trial credit amount, in US dollars (for example, US$100).
Customers can choose any of your pricing plans, and the trial credit applies to
the plan that they choose.
The trial ends when the customer reaches the credit limit or at the end of the
trial period, whichever comes first. For example, if you offer a 15-day trial
with a maximum credit of $100, the trial ends when users reach the $100 limit or
at the end of 15 days.
At the end of the trial period, customers pay based on the pricing plan they
chose. If the customer changed their plan during the trial, they pay based on
their new plan.
If your product's pricing is usage-based, we recommend a trial credit limit
that is twice the cost of the usage that you expect.
