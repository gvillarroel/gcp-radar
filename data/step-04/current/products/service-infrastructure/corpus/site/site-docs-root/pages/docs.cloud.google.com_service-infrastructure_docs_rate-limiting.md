This page describes how to use Service Infrastructure to implement rate limiting for
managed services that are integrated with the
Service Management API.
A managed service can serve many service consumers . In
order to protect system capacity and ensure fair usage, a managed service often
uses rate limiting to distribute its capacity among its service consumers.
The Service Management and
Service Control APIs allow you to manage and enforce
rate limiting.
Configuring rate limits
To use the rate limiting feature, configure _quota metrics_ and
_quota limits_ in the service configuration for your
service producer project.
Currently, the supported rate limiting is the number of requests per minute per
service consumer, where the service consumer is a Google Cloud project as identified
by an API key, a project id, or a project number. For rate limiting, the concept
of request is an opaque concept. A service can choose an HTTP request as a
request, or a byte of payload as a request. The rate limiting feature is
independent of the semantics of a request.
Quota metrics
A metric is a named counter for measuring a certain value over time. For
example, the number of HTTP requests a service receives is a metric. A quota
metric is a metric that is used for quota and rate limiting purposes. When an
activity occurs with a service, one or more quota metrics may increase. When the
metric value hits the predefined quota limit, the service should reject the
activity with a 429 error.
Quota limits
A quota limit represents an enforceable limit on a quota metric. For example,
the number of requests per service consumer per minute is a quota limit. At this
time, the only supported type of quota limit is per minute per consumer,
specifically, 1/min/{project} .
The actual rate limit for a (service, consumer) pair is controlled by 3
settings:
The default limit specified for the managed service.
The service producer override for the service consumer.
The service consumer override for the service consumer.
The effective rate limit is:
The default limit if there is no override.
The service producer override if there is a service producer override, but no
service consumer override.
The minimum(service consumer override, default limit) if there is a service
consumer override, but no service producer override.
The minimum(service consumer override, service producer override) if there are
both service producer and service consumer overrides.
Enforcing rate limiting
To enforce rate limiting, each server that belongs to a managed service needs to
call the Service Control API
services.allocateQuota
method regularly. If the response of the
services.allocateQuota
method indicates that the usage is above the limit, the server should reject the
incoming request with a 429 error. For more information, see the reference
documentation for the
services.allocateQuota
method.
It is recommended that each server should use batching, caching, and predictive
logic to improve system performance and reliability. In general, one server
should only call the
services.allocateQuota
method once per second for the same (service, consumer, metric) tuple.
The following example demonstrates how to call the
services.allocateQuota
method to check for rate limiting. The important request parameters that must be
set correctly are the service name, the consumer id, the metric name, and the
metric value. The
services.allocateQuota
method will try to increase the usage by the specified amount for the (service,
consumer, metric) tuple. If the increased usage goes above the limit, an error
is returned. The following example uses the gcurl command to demonstrate the
call. To learn how to set this up, see
Getting Started with the Service Control API .
Note: A service consumer can be specified using a project id, a project
number, or an API key.
gcurl -d '{
"allocateOperation": {
"operationId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
"methodName": "google.example.hello.v1.HelloService.GetHello",

Error handling
If the HTTP response code is 200 , and the response contains
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
QuotaError ,
your server should reject the request with a 429 error. If the response
doesn't contain any quota error, your server should
continue serving the incoming requests. For all other quota errors, your server
should reject the request with a 409 error. Due to the security risks, you
need to be very careful about what error information you include in the error
message.
For all other HTTP response codes, it is likely your server has some programming
bug. It is recommended your server continue to serve the incoming requests while
you debug the problem. If the
services.allocateQuota
method returns any unexpected error, your service should log the error and
accept the income requests. You can debug the error later.
Fail Open
The rate limiting feature is for protecting your managed service from getting
overloaded and distributing your service capacity fairly among service
consumers. Because most service consumers should not reach their rate limits
during normal operations, your managed service should accept all incoming
requests if the rate limiting feature is unavailable, also known as fail open .
This prevents your service availability being affected by the rate limiting
system.
If you use the
services.allocateQuota
method, your service must ignore 500 , 503 and 504 errors without any
retry. To prevent a hard dependency on the rate limiting feature, the
Service Control API issues a limited amount of error injection on a
regular basis.
