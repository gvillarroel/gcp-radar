Enabling private services access
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
As a service producer, you can allow service consumers to provision resources
with private (RFC 1918) or public IP addresses. If service consumers want to use
private IP addresses, they must use private services
access . However, service
consumers can only use private service access if your managed service
offers it. To offer private connectivity, you must complete a one-time
onboarding process .
The onboarding process requires you to use the Service Networking
API and tenancy units. For detailed step-by-step instructions, contact your
Google representative.
Overview
The following sections describe the components and general network topology
required to enable private services access for your managed service.
Tenancy units
When a service consumer enables your managed service, the service create a
tenancy unit to formalize
a relationship between your Google Cloud organization and the service
consumer's project. Tenancy units isolate resources and billing costs between
different service consumers.
For each service consumer, you will have two tenancy units. One for your managed
service and another for the private access management service. The managed
service is the external service that you're offering to service consumers, and
the private access management service manages private connections with service
consumer VPC networks. These tenancy units must be in the same
Google Cloud organization where your managed service lives.
Service Networking
Service Networking automates the private connectivity set up
(using VPC Network Peering) between you and the service consumer. You enable and
use Service Networking in the same project in which you created
the private access management service. This is a different project from the one
that contains your managed service.
When a service consumer creates a private connection with your managed service,
Service Networking creates a Shared VPC host project and a
Shared VPC network for you. The host project and network are created in a
predesignated Google Cloud folder in your organization. You specify this
folder name as part of the onboarding process. The project and network are
contained in a tenancy unit, so they are isolated and can only be used by that
service consumer.
After Service Networking creates the Shared VPC network,
Service Networking automatically creates a VPC
Networking Peering connection between the Shared VPC network and the service
consumer-specified VPC network.
Service consumers must also supply an allocated IP address range when they
create the private connection. This allocation reserves IP addresses that can
only be used by you, a service producer. For example, when a service consumer
provisions a resource, you use Service Networking to create
subnets in the Shared VPC network. For the subnet's IP address range,
Service Networking automatically selects a range from the
allocated range. This process prevents collisions between the Shared VPC network
and service consumer VPC network.
Note: Creating a subnet is a long running operation. You can
poll it regularly to check
the status of the operation.
Shared VPC service projects
When your service provisions a service consumer's resource for the first time,
your managed service provisions it in a Shared VPC service
project , which is attached to the
Service Networking host project. This Shared VPC relationship
enables resources in the service project to use subnets in the Shared VPC
network.
Your managed service creates the service project in a tenancy unit and
predesignated folder, specified during the onboarding process. The folder and
tenancy unit are related to your managed service and are different from the ones
that Service Networking uses.
Network topology
The following example shows a single service consumer that has private
connectivity to a single service producer. The service consumer provisioned two
resources in different regions. Because each resource is in a different region,
they are in different subnets.
Overview of Service Networking for service producers (click to enlarge)
There are two Endpoints projects: one for the managed service
and another one for the private access management service. These must be in
the same Google Cloud organization.
Within the Google Cloud organization, there are two folders, one for
each of the Endpoints services. The private access management
service folder contains a Shared VPC host project for the private connection.
The managed service folder contains a service project for service consumer
resources.
In each folder, the service consumer-related projects are contained in
tenancy units. Both tenancy units are associated with
consumer-project-a .
Service consumers must initiate the private connection (which is also a
VPC Network Peering connection). They must supply an allocated
IP address range for the private connection from which the subnet IP addresses
come. For more information about the service consumer steps, see Configuring
Private Services Access .
If you offer multiple services, service consumers only need one private
connection. All traffic to and from the service consumer goes through the
Shared VPC host project.
In a single service consumer project, multiple VPC networks can
privately connect to your services. This requires a Shared VPC
host project for each connected VPC network. However, all of
those projects can be contained in the same consumer-project-a tenancy unit.
In the host project, you must configure firewall rules and routes to enable
connectivity to new resources. Because other services can use the same Shared
VPC network, these rules can allow or deny connectivity between
your different services.
Onboarding process
The following list is a general outline of the onboarding process. You must
complete this process for each managed service that will offer private
connectivity. Contact your Google representative for more information.
Create a peering management service.
This is a managed service that a service producer builds through
the Service Management and Endpoints API. For more
information, contact your Google representative.
Provide the following configuration information to your Google
representative:
The minimum IP address range that service consumers must allocate when
they connect to you, specified as an IPv4 prefix length. If you offer
multiple services, you might want users to allocate a larger IP address
range, such as /16 .
The folder ID where your private access management service creates Shared
VPC hosts projects. Use Resource Manager to find the folder ID.
The billing account that's associated with the organization where your
private access management service creates Shared VPC host projects.
The principals (typically these are service account IDs) that manage the
host project's network firewall rules.
Activate the Compute Engine API.
For each Shared VPC host project, activate the
compute.googleapis.com API, which you can do by using the
Service Usage APIs or in the project configuration.
After resources have been provisioned, configure firewall rules for the
Shared VPC network in the host project. You must use the identity that you
provided during the onboarding process to access the VPC network. If you
offer other services, those services might use the same VPC network. Don't
create rules that might inadvertently allow or deny traffic to other
services.
Inform service consumers.
Inform service consumers that they must establish a private connection. For
more information, see Configuring Private Services
Access . Service consumers must provide
the following information:
The name of their project and network where they want to establish private
connectivity.
The Cloud region where the resource must be provisioned.
