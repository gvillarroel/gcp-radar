Reporting Billing Metrics
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to use Service Infrastructure to enable
managed services to send billing usage data so that
Cloud Billing can charge against service consumers .
For example, you can define a metric called library.appspot.com/books/borrowed
to measure the number of books borrowed by a customer and define a stock keeping
unit (SKU) and price for it.
The Service Control API accepts metrics, which it batches, aggregates,
and forwards to Cloud Billing . Cloud Billing ingests these
metrics and generates bills based on the predefined price model. If there is no
predefined price model, Cloud Billing simply disregards the
billing metrics. To define the price model, please contact your Google Cloud
partner account manager.
Configuring billing
Before you send billing data to the Service Control API, you need to
specify three different bits of information in your
service configuration :
Monitored resources : You can collect billing usage for each
resource. The monitored resources need at least one label key
cloud.googleapis.com/location to indicate the location of the billing usage.
Metrics : You can report one or more metrics. Each metric measures the
usage of a given type of resource. Only DELTA metrics with INT64 values are
supported for billing.
Billing configuration : Lets you specify the metrics to be sent to
Cloud Billing.
The following example service configuration defines one metric that measures the
number of books borrowed by a customer. A client can invoke the
services.report method to report values on the metric. See
billing.proto
for details on billing configuration.
# library
monitored_resources :
- type : library . appspot . com / branch
labels :
- key : cloud . googleapis . com / location
description : The cloud location .
- key : library . appspot . com / city
description : The city where the library branch is located in .
# The metrics to be used .
metrics :
- name : library . appspot . com / books / borrowed
metric_kind : DELTA
value_type : INT64
unit : '1'
# The billing configuration .

metrics :

Reporting billing metrics
Once you have configured monitoring in the
service configuration
and pushed the service configuration using the Service Management API, you can
call the Service Control API to report metrics. The following example
uses the gcurl command to demonstrate the call. For information on how to set
this up, see
Getting Started with the Service Control API .
$ gcurl -d "{
'operations': [ {
'operationId': '8356d3c5-f9b5-4274-b4f9-079a3731e6e5',
'consumerId': 'project:library-consumer',
'startTime': '`date +%FT%T%:z`',
'endTime': '`date +%FT%T%:z`',
'labels': {
'cloud.googleapis.com/location': 'us-west1',
'library.appspot.com/city': 'Kirkland',
},
'metricValueSets': [ {
'metricName': 'library.appspot.com/books/borrowed',
'metricValues': [ { 'int64Value': '10' } ]
} ]
} ]
}" https://servicecontrol.googleapis.com/v1/services/library.appspot.com:report
