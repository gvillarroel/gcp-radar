Enabled service
Before a user can use a managed service, it must first be enabled for a
service consumer project. Enabling a
managed service for a service consumer project
allows a user to use it, adds monitoring pages in the Google Cloud console, and
enables billing for the service if billing is enabled for the project.
Managed service
A managed service offers access to a service through a well-defined
interface, such as an API. Users access the managed service without having
to manage the underlying resources, such as compute and storage, that
implement the service.
For example, you can build a data storage service using Compute Engine
and Cloud SQL and offer it to your users as an API. Your users interact
with that API only. They don’t know or care how you implemented the managed
service. A managed service is also referred to as a service.
Operation
Service Infrastructure uses the generic concept of an operation to represent
the activities of a managed service , such as API calls and
resource usage. Each operation is associated with a managed service and a
specific service consumer , and has a set of properties that
describe the operation, such as the API method name and resource usage
amount.
Note: Service Infrastructure APIs use a separate resource to represent a
long-running operation that is the result of a network API call. To learn
more, see
Polling Long Running Operations .
Private service
Private services can only be enabled by users and members of groups with
which the service has been explicitly shared, such as APIs created using
Cloud Endpoints .
A private service is not related to connectivity through public or private
(RFC 1918) IP addresses.
Public service
Public APIs and services are globally visible to all users. Examples of
public Google Cloud APIs and services include
BigQuery API , Cloud Storage , and
Cloud Monitoring API . For a complete list of public APIs,
see Cloud APIs .
A public service is not related to connectivity through public or private
(RFC 1918) IP addresses.
Service configurations
Each managed service is described by a service configuration
which covers a wide range of features, including its name, title, RPC API
definitions, REST API definitions, documentation, authentication, and more.
To change the configuration of a managed service, you need to publish an
updated service configuration. To learn more, see
Managing Service Configurations .
The Service Management API also allows publishing an
OpenAPI
specification, formerly known as the Swagger Specification, which is
automatically converted to a corresponding service configuration.
Service consumer
An agent (such as a user or group of users) who owns a Google Cloud project
that has enabled and can therefore use APIs on a managed
service . A managed service can have many service consumers.
Service Consumer Management API
Service Consumer Management provides utilities to help you manage your relationship
with your managed services' users, including the ability to
create and manage tenancy units and override quota limits.
Service Control API
The Service Control API works with a set of
managed services and their operations , and checks
whether an operation is allowed to proceed, and reports completed
operations. To learn more, see
Service Infrastructure Overview .
Service Management API
The Service Management API manages the creation and life cycle of
managed services and service configurations . Use
the Service Management API to rollout, publish, and update your managed
services on Google Cloud so that your users can find, enable, and use them.
Service producer
An agent (such as a user or group of users) who owns a
Google Cloud project responsible for publishing and maintaining a managed
service . Each managed service is owned by exactly one service
producer.
Service rollout
A service rollout defines how the Service Management API
should deploy service configurations to Google Cloud Platform and
how the configurations take effect. It lets you specify multiple
service configuration versions to be deployed together and a strategy that
indicates how they should be used.
The Service Management API keeps a history of service rollouts so that you
can roll back to previous service configuration versions. You can roll back
a service configuration by initiating a new rollout that clones a previously
submitted rollout record.
Service Usage API
Provides methods for you and users of your managed services to list, enable,
and disable APIs, and view and manage quota limits, in Google Cloud
projects.
Tenant project
A tenant project is a Google-owned Google Cloud project used to host the
resources of a managed service dedicated to a single
service consumer . This approach creates an isolated environment
for each consumer. A tenancy unit can contain multiple tenant
projects.
Tenancy units
Tenancy units provide per-service, per- service consumer
isolated environments used for deploying managed services . When
a new user starts using your service, you can create all resources specific
to that service consumer in a single tenancy unit. Creating a separate
tenancy unit per service consumer helps ensure your user's data is isolated,
and if a user stops using your service, deleting the tenancy unit helps
ensure the user's data is deleted. To learn more about tenancy units, see
Getting Started with Tenancy Units .
