Admission Control

Introduction
This page describes how to use the Service Control API v2 for admission
control for managed services that are integrated
with Service Infrastructure. It is intended for service producers who want to
deeply integrate their services with Google Cloud.
Service Infrastructure is a foundational platform for developers to produce, manage,
secure and
consume APIs and services. It uses a simple, generic service usage model:
a consumer consumes a service managed by a producer. All Google APIs and
Google Cloud APIs use this model, since they are also
built on top of Service Infrastructure.
When a client accesses a service, all the entities involved in the access
typically require a status and policy check, including the consumer,
service, producer, user, application, network, and resources. With
Service Infrastructure, this process is called admission control, which includes
authentication, authorization, auditing, rate limiting, and more.
Note: For terminology used in this page, see
API Glossary .
Service Control API v2
The Service Control API v2 provides a simple
services.check
method that
provides admission control to all services integrated with Service Infrastructure.
This method lets you do the following in a single method call:
Status checking
Abuse status
Billing status
Consumer status
Service status
Service enablement
Authentication
Google OAuth access token
Google service account signed JWT
Authorization
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Auditing
Cloud Audit Logs .
The audit log is associated with service "externalaudit.googleapis.com".
When a service calls the Service Control API, the producer is also a
consumer of the Service Control API. Therefore, the services.check
method also performs admission control on the call to the Service Control API.
In order for a service to call the Service Control API, you must
enable the Service Control API on the producer project and have
proper permissions on the service. For more information, see
Cloud APIs Getting Started and Service Control
Access Control .
Request attributes
When a client accesses a service, the service needs to abstract the access
into one or more API requests that can be checked with admission control.
In most cases, such accesses are indeed real API requests.
In other cases, the access can be complicated data import jobs or SQL queries,
and the service needs to model the access in terms of a set of virtual API
requests and perform admission control on each request.
To perform admission control using the Service Control API, the service needs
to call the
services.check
method with required request attributes. The
following table lists the attributes needed for admission control.
For the complete specification, see
AttributeContext .
Attibute
Description
Example
origin.ip
The IP address of the caller.
"1.2.3.4"
api.service
The API service name.
"endpointsapis.appspot.com"
api.operation
The API method name.
"google.example.hello.v1.HelloService.GetHello"
api.version
The API version string.
"v1"
api.protocol
The API protocol name.
"https"
request.id
A unique request id.
"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"
request.time
The time of the request.
"2019-07-31T05:20:00Z"
request.method
The HTTP method name.
"POST"
request.scheme
The URL scheme.
"https"
request.host
The HTTP host header.
"endpointsapis.appspot.com"
request.path
The URL path.
"/v1/hello"
request.headers
The HTTP request headers. The required headers are "authorization", "user-agent", "origin", "referer".
resource.name
The target resource name.
"projects/123/topics/news-feed"
Resource attributes
When a client accesses a service, the access may involve one or more resources
inside the service, such as reading an object or creating a VM instance.
The service can use Service Infrastructure admission control for access control on
resources, supported by IAM and
Cloud Audit Logs . If your
service doesn't need access control, you can skip this section.
For access control, a service needs to pass resource attributes to the
services.check method along with the request attributes.
The following table shows the resource attributes required for access control.
Attibute
Description
Example
name
The resource name.
"projects/123/locations/global/instances/instance-1"
type
The resource type. The format is "{service}/{Kind}".
"endpointsapis.appspot.com/Instance"
permission
The resource permission. The format is "{service}/{kinds}.{verb}".
"endpointsapis.appspot.com/instances.get"
For performance and efficiency, the services.check method allows you to
check multiple permissions on a single resource in one call.
Performing admission control
Once you have deployed your service configuration to the Service Management
API and your service is ready to serve requests from clients, you can
begin calling services.check for your deployed service. You should
call services.check to perform admission control whenever your
service receives a request.
To quickly experiment with the admission control, you can use the gcurl
command to call the services.check method. See
Getting Started with the Service Control API
for the initial setup steps.
The following example shows you how to use gcurl command to call
services.check over HTTP.
gcurl -d '{
"service_config_id": "latest",
"attributes": {
"origin": {
"ip": "1.2.3.4"
},
"api": {
"service": "endpointsapis.appspot.com",
"operation": "google.example.hello.v1.HelloService.GetHello",
"version": "v1",
"protocol": "https"
}
},
"request": {
"id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
"time": "2019-07-31T05:20:00Z",
"scheme": "https",
"host": "endpointsapis.appspot.com"
"headers": {
"authorization": "Bearer xxx",
"user-agent": "curl/1.0"
}
},
"resources": [
]
}' https://servicecontrol.googleapis.com/v2/services/endpointsapis.appspot.com:check
{
}
The response from the services.check method indicates whether the admission
control has passed. If it passes, the response should be empty. If it fails,
the status in the response contains error information that the service
should return to the client. The service often needs to translate the error
information to its own format. The service can also use the information
for logging and monitoring purposes.
For production services, you should use one of Google-provided client libraries
to call the Service Control API. Such libraries provide great usability
and handle common functionality automatically, such as authentication.
