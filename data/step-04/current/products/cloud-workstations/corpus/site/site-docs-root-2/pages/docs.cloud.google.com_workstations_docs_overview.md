Cloud Workstations overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud Workstations provides managed development environments on Google Cloud
with built-in security and preconfigured yet customizable development
environments. Instead of requiring your developers to install software and run
setup scripts, you can create a workstation configuration that specifies your
environment in a reproducible way. Any updates to a workstation configuration
automatically apply to workstations the next time they start. Developers access
the workstations through a browser-based IDE, from multiple local code editors
(such as VSCode or JetBrains IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and PyCharm
Professional), or through SSH.
Cloud Workstations uses the following Google Cloud resources to manage your
development environments:
Workstation clusters define a group of workstations in a particular
region and the VPC network they're attached to.
Workstation clusters aren't related to
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
clusters.
Workstation configurations act as templates for workstations. The
workstation configuration defines details such as the workstation virtual
machine (VM) instance type, persistent storage, container image defining
environment, which IDE or Code Editor to use, and more. Administrators and
platform teams can also use
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
rules to grant access to teams or to individual developers.
Workstations are preconfigured development environments that provide a
cloud IDE, language tooling, libraries, and more. Workstations can be
started or stopped on demand, and run on
Compute Engine
VMs in your project, with a persistent disk attached to store data
between sessions.
Administrators and platform teams create workstation configurations that they
share with their development team. Each developer creates a workstation based
on a workstation configuration.
Figure 1. Cloud Workstations Concepts
Workstation lifecycle
Workstations run on ephemeral Compute Engine VMs, and can be started or
stopped on demand to improve cost savings. Additionally, administrators and
platform teams can configure an idle timeout or running timeout in the
workstation configuration
to help make sure that workstations shut down when they are no longer used,
which reduces costs. It also helps make sure that all workstations synchronize with
the latest changes applied to their workstation configuration when each
workstation restarts.
Persistent storage
When a workstation stops, its ephemeral VM is deleted along with all workstation
runtime data. Administrators and platform teams can optionally configure a
persistent home directory on a workstation configuration, so all data saved to
the home directory persists between sessions. This persistent storage is
implemented as a
persistent disk that
is attached to the workstation VM when the session starts, and detached when the
session ends.
Workstation DNS hostnames
Every workstation is given its own unique hostname. All workstations in a
workstation cluster share a common, cluster-specific domain name, and the
workstation cluster takes care of routing requests for this hostname to the
running workstation. The workstation hostname can be used to connect to the
workstation through your browser.
Configuration updates
Updates to a workstation configuration automatically apply to workstations
when each workstation restarts after the configuration update.
For example, changing the machine type in a workstation configuration changes
the machine type of the VMs used by the associated workstations the next time
each workstation restarts. Administrators and platform teams can configure an
idle timeout or running timeout in the
workstation configuration
to help make sure that workstations synchronize with configuration updates
within a bounded period of time.
Gemini Code Assist
Gemini Code Assist is an AI-powered
collaborator in Google Cloud. If you select the Cloud Workstations Base Editor (Code OSS for Cloud Workstations)
when you
create your workstation configuration ,
Gemini can help you with the following in the base editor:
Provide guidance to help you solve problems with your code.
Generate code for your project.
Receive inline suggestions while you're coding.
Gemini provides source citations when suggestions directly
quote at length from a source to help you comply with any license requirements.

Software supply chain security
Cloud Workstations is one of the Google Cloud components you
can use to protect your software supply chain. You can use
Cloud Workstations together with other Google Cloud products and
features to improve the security posture of developer workflows and tools,
software dependencies, CI/CD systems used to build and deploy your software,
and runtime environments such as Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Run. To learn
more, see
Software supply chain security .
