Customize container images
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The
preconfigured base images
provided by Cloud Workstations contain only a minimal environment with IDE,
basic Linux terminal and language tools and a sshd server. To expedite the
environment setup of specific development use cases, you can create custom
container images that extend these base images to pre-install tools and
dependencies and that run automation scripts.
For custom container images, we recommend setting up a pipeline to automatically
rebuild these images when the Cloud Workstations base image is updated, in
addition to running a container scanning tool such as
Artifact Analysis to
inspect any additional dependencies you added. You're responsible for
maintaining and updating custom packages and dependencies added to custom images.
Before you begin
You need a machine with tooling for building container images such as
Docker, and for pushing images to
Artifact Registry
using the
Google Cloud CLI .
You can use Cloud Workstations or Cloud Shell Editor for performing
these steps, which have this tooling pre-installed.
Select which base image you want to use from our
list of supported base images ,
such as
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest .
Alternatively, you can use your own container image or use external
container images by following the instructions to
Use your own container image .
Create a folder such as CUSTOM_IMAGE_FOLDER and a
Dockerfile inside this folder extending the base image selected, as shown in
the examples that follow.
Cloud Workstations base image structure
Cloud Workstations base images share the following defined structure:
The base image entrypoint file is set to /google/scripts/entrypoint.sh .
On startup, base images run files under /etc/workstation-startup.d/* in
lexicographical order to initialize the workstation environment.
The files and their behavior are as follows:
000_configure-docker.sh : Configures and runs Docker inside the
workstation.
010_add-user.sh : Creates the default user in Cloud Workstations.
Because the persistent disk is dynamically attached to the container,
users must be added on workstation startup, not in the Dockerfile.
020_start-sshd.sh : Starts the sshd service in the container.
030_customize-environment.sh : Executes /home/user/.workstation/customize_environment as user .
110_start-$IDE.sh : Starts the IDE for the image.
Cloud Workstations stores Docker images in the home directory at
/home/.docker_data so that the images are preserved between sessions.
To add additional functionality during workstation startup, add your scripts in
the /etc/workstation-startup.d/ directory:
Scripts in this directory run as root by default. To execute the scripts as
a different user, use the runuser command.
Because scripts execute in lexicographical order, we recommended that you
prefix the scripts with a three digit number that is greater than 200.
Alternatively, if you don't want to extend a workstations image, you can create
a customize_environment script in
your home directory.
Home directory modifications
When the workstation configuration specifies a persistent home directory
(which is the default behavior), a persistent disk backing the home directory
is dynamically attached to the container at runtime. This process overwrites
modifications made to the /home directory at container image build time.
To preserve updates, modify the /home directory at container runtime
by adding a script in the in the /etc/workstation-startup.d directory,
or by adding per-user configuration in the /etc/profile.d directory.
To speed up the process, consider running the setup script as a background
process (add an ampersand, & , to the end of the command) to avoid
blocking container startup.
Some examples of build time configuration that should be moved to container
runtime:
Per-user git configuration
git repositories cloned in the home directory
Direct user configuration, such as placing files in a $HOME/.config directory
User creation
User creation and modification
Because the persistent disk dynamically attaches to the container at runtime,
users must be added on workstation startup, not in the Dockerfile. To modify
or create additional users, we recommended that you update
/etc/workstation-startup.d/010_add-user.sh , or
create your own script that executes on startup.
Additionally, you can modify the default bash profile for the users by updating
the files in /etc/profile.d .
Update preconfigured Secure APT keys
Cloud Workstations base images come preinstalled with a number of tools obtained
from various third-party repositories using Secure APT. As part of the install
process, public keys provided by the repository owners are imported using gpg
and placed into individual files under /usr/share/keyrings/ . These files are
referenced from corresponding list files under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ .
This enables apt to verify the integrity of the a given repository when
interacting with it.
On occasion, third-party repository owners may decide to change the public key
used to validate the integrity of their repository, which causes apt to
display an error when interacting with it. To resolve this potential problem,
you can use /google/scripts/refresh-preinstalled-apt-keys.sh , which
obtains the latest versions of preinstalled public keys and re-imports them.
List installed IDE versions
Several Cloud Workstations base images come preinstalled with an IDE. For
convenience, see the included /google/scripts/preinstalled-ide-versions.sh
script, which lists the name and version information of IDEs installed in
the image.
Turn off sudo root privileges
The default workstation user has sudo root access privileges in these
containers. To turn off root access to the Docker container, set the
CLOUD_WORKSTATIONS_CONFIG_DISABLE_SUDO environment variable
to true when creating the workstation configuration.
To set this environment variable through the Google Cloud console when creating
your workstation configuration, follow these steps:
When creating your workstation configuration, complete the configuration
for Basic information and the Machine configuration.
On the Environment customization dialog, expand the
Advanced container options section and select Environment variables .
Click add Add variable .
Enter CLOUD_WORKSTATIONS_CONFIG_DISABLE_SUDO and true as the value.
Note: If a user is able to break out of the Docker container, they might be
able to obtain root privileges on the underlying VM.
Customize without extending an image
For convenience all Cloud Workstations base images check for the presence of
an executable file located at /home/user/.workstation/customize_environment
and, if it exists, run it in the background as user . This lets you
run any script or binary at startup. Unlike .profile or .bashrc the script
only runs once when the workstation starts, rather than once for each shell
login.
Because the customize_environment script runs as user , be sure to update
permissions as necessary when writing your script. For example, if you want to
install Emacs everytime your workstation starts, the content of
customize_environment might be similar to the following:
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y emacs
Execution logs for customize_environment can be found in the container at
/var/log/customize_environment and are also written to the
container output logs .
On successful execution of customize_environment , a file is created in
/var/run/customize_environment_done . Because customize_environment runs in
parallel with Workstation startup, packages installed by the script can be
available as early as a few moments after your workstation has started.
Preventing idle timeouts
For convenience, all Cloud Workstations base images include a preinstalled script
at /google/scripts/keep_alive.sh . This script sends regular keep-alive
messages, which can prevent the workstation from shutting down due to idle
timeouts when you are running background processes without direct interaction.
Use your own container image
You can also use your own container image or use external container images,
as long as they are Linux-based and run a blocking process when the container
starts up.
When setting up the Dockerfile, the ENTRYPOINT instruction must run a
blocking process such as sleep infinity so that the container continues
to run, rather than immediately exit. Alternatively, in the workstation
configuration you can set the config.container.args field to specify a
blocking process.
When using your own container image, note the following:
Cloud Workstations does not require additional scripts from the
Cloud Workstations base image.
You can, however, look at the scripts in the /etc/workstation-startup.d/
directory within a container running the Cloud Workstations base image.
The filenames indicate what each script does.
We recommend that you run an SSH server in the container. Refer to
/etc/workstation-startup.d/020_start-sshd.sh in the default
base image
to learn how Cloud Workstations sets this up by default.
We recommend that you run your default IDE or web server on port 80 .
Extend Cloud Workstations base images
When extending a Cloud Workstations base image to create a custom image for your
workstation environment, you can take three approaches:
Update your Dockerfile to include any additional static assets that you
want to add.
Add additional executable files under /etc/workstation-startup.d/ to
customize the running container. Files under this directory automatically
run in lexicographical order at container startup, so you can prefix your
filename to run it at the appropriate time during workstation startup.
Override the ENTRYPOINT in your Dockerfile to fully customize your
container startup.
Note: Any user modification must be done at container runtime, not in the
Dockerfile. This is because /home is dynamically mounted into the container at
startup time.
Sample custom Dockerfiles
This section provides example scenarios and instructions for creating your own
Dockerfiles.
Container image with emacs pre-installed
To create a container image with emacs pre-installed, run the following
commands:
FROM us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest
RUN sudo apt update
RUN sudo apt install -y emacs
Container image with user customization
Follow these steps to customize a container image:
Create a script in /etc/workstation-startup.d/* that runs after
010_add-user.sh —for example, 011_customize-user.sh :
#!/bin/bash
# Create new group
groupadd $GROUP
# Add the user to a new group
usermod -a -G $GROUP $USERNAME
Replace $GROUP with the new group name and
$USERNAME with the user's username.
Assuming that you named your script, 011_customize-user.sh , add the
following to your image in your Dockerfile and make it executable:
FROM us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest
COPY 011_customize-user.sh /etc/workstation-startup.d/
RUN chmod +x /etc/workstation-startup.d/011_customize-user.sh
Container image that sets container environment variables in SSH sessions
Environment variables set at the workstation configuration or workstation level
are passed to direct subprocesses using the entrypoint command. This includes the
IDE in the preconfigured base images. However, SSH sessions are not child
processes of the entrypoint, and don't have these custom environment
variables set.
To set those environment variables in the SSH sessions, setup a custom
container image that relays these environment variables from the container's
entrypoint command to the /etc/environment file.
To accomplish that, follow these steps:
Create a script in /etc/workstation-startup.d/* that runs after
010_add-user.sh —for example, 011_add-ssh-env-variables.sh :
#!/bin/bash
#
echo "CUSTOM_ENV_VAR= $ CUSTOM_ENV_VAR " >> /etc/environment
Replace CUSTOM_ENV_VAR with the intended environment variable
name.
Assuming that you named your script, 011_add-ssh-env-variables.sh , add the
following to your image in your Dockerfile and make it executable:
FROM us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest
COPY 011_add-ssh-env-variables.sh /etc/workstation-startup.d/
RUN chmod +x /etc/workstation-startup.d/011_add-ssh-env-variables.sh
Container image that enables X11 forwarding for SSH sessions
X11 forwarding lets you start remote applications and forward the application
display to a local machine.
To create a container image that enables X11 forwarding, modify the OpenSSH daemon
configuration file ( /etc/ssh/sshd_config ) provided by the Cloud Workstations base images by
appending X11Forwarding yes (to permit X11 forwarding) and AddressFamily inet
(to ensure that only IPv4 is used). For more information about these keywords, see the OpenBSD web
pages about AddressFamily and
X11Forwarding .
Here's a sample Dockerfile, which makes the necessary modifications:
FROM us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest
# Permit X11 forwarding using only IPv4
RUN cat >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config <<-EOF
AddressFamily inet
X11Forwarding yes
EOF
Copy Code OSS for Cloud Workstations into another container image
A multi-stage build lets you use multiple FROM statements
in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and enables
copying artifacts between build stages. To add Code OSS for Cloud Workstations to
another container image use a multi-stage build to copy the application folder
/opt/code-oss into your image. If you want to start Code OSS for Cloud Workstations
at container startup time, additionally copy the script /etc/workstation-startup.d/110_start-code-oss.sh
into your container.
Here's a sample Dockerfile which copies Code OSS into the JetBrains IntelliJ
Ultimate image. You can then interact with either IDE:
FROM us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest as code-oss-image
FROM us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/jetbrains-intellij:latest
# Copy Code OSS for Cloud Workstations and startup scripts into our custom image
COPY --from = code-oss-image /opt/code-oss /opt/code-oss
COPY --from = code-oss-image /etc/workstation-startup.d/110_start-code-oss.sh /etc/workstation-startup.d/110_start-code-oss.sh
# Use the existing entrypoint script which will execute all scripts in /etc/workstation-startup.d/
ENTRYPOINT [ "/google/scripts/entrypoint.sh" ]
Container image that pre-installs IDE extensions in Code OSS for Cloud Workstations for Java development
To create a container image that pre-installs IDE extensions in
Code OSS for Cloud Workstations for Java development at build time, run the following commands:
FROM us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest
RUN wget https://open-vsx.org/api/vscjava/vscode-java-debug/0.40.1/file/vscjava.vscode-java-debug-0.40.1.vsix && \
unzip vscjava.vscode-java-debug-0.40.1.vsix "extension/*" && \
mv extension /opt/code-oss/extensions/java-debug
RUN wget https://open-vsx.org/api/vscjava/vscode-java-dependency/0.19.1/file/vscjava.vscode-java-dependency-0.19.1.vsix && \
unzip vscjava.vscode-java-dependency-0.19.1.vsix "extension/*" && \
mv extension /opt/code-oss/extensions/java-dependency
RUN wget https://open-vsx.org/api/redhat/java/1.6.0/file/redhat.java-1.6.0.vsix && \
unzip redhat.java-1.6.0.vsix "extension/*" && \
mv extension /opt/code-oss/extensions/redhat-java
RUN wget https://open-vsx.org/api/vscjava/vscode-maven/0.35.2/file/vscjava.vscode-maven-0.35.2.vsix && \
unzip vscjava.vscode-maven-0.35.2.vsix "extension/*" && \
mv extension /opt/code-oss/extensions/java-maven
RUN wget https://open-vsx.org/api/vscjava/vscode-java-test/0.35.0/file/vscjava.vscode-java-test-0.35.0.vsix && \
unzip vscjava.vscode-java-test-0.35.0.vsix "extension/*" && \
mv extension /opt/code-oss/extensions/java-test
RUN chmod a+rwx -R /opt/code-oss/extensions/
If you pre-install extensions, they are considered built-in extensions.
You won't be able to update these extensions and they might not appear in
the installed section on the
Extensions Marketplace .
However, you can find your built-in extensions by searching for
@builtin .
Another way to install extensions at startup is to run a
startup script .
For example, include the following startup script under
/etc/workstation-startup.d/120_install_extensions.sh :
sudo -u user /opt/code-oss/bin/codeoss-cloudworkstations --install-extension vscjava.vscode-java-debug@0.40.1 \
--install-extension vscjava.vscode-java-dependency@0.19.1 \
--install-extension redhat.java@1.6.0 \
--install-extension vscjava.vscode-maven@0.35.2 \
--install-extension vscjava.vscode-java-test@0.35.0
Using this method, the extension appears on the
Extensions Marketplace and you
can update from there.
Note: You can also pre-download your VSIX files at
build time and use them at runtime for added protection and to improve
startup performance.
Install JetBrains IDEs and plugins into base images
When customizing Docker images for workstation configurations, you can install
JetBrains IDEs and plugins, such as
Cloud Code for IntelliJ ,
into the base image.
Cloud Workstations base images for JetBrains products include the following
scripts to help you:
jetbrains-installer.sh : install JetBrains IDEs
plugin-installer.sh : install plugins, such as Cloud Code for IntelliJ
Use these scripts as needed to customize the base image, to call them with a
startup script, or to run them after starting the workstation.
Installer scripts
To view the source files for the jetbrains-installer.sh and
plugin-installer.sh scripts, start a workstation using a workstation
configuration that uses one of the JetBrains predefined images, connect to the
workstation either through JetBrains Gateway or through SSH, and then browse
the script files in the installer-scripts directory, which is located in the
root directory.
We recommend that you run these scripts at container build time. Avoid running
them in an already started workstation.
Use the plugin installer script
The plugin-installer.sh script uses the following syntax:
plugin-installer.sh [ -v VERSION ] [ -d DESTINATION-DIRECTORY ] [ -c CHECKSUM ] [ -f ] PLUGIN_ID
Replace the following:
VERSION : optional version number of the plugin to install.
DESTINATION-DIRECTORY : optional directory into which the plugin
should be installed. If unspecified, the working directory is used.
CHECKSUM : optional SHA-256 checksum of the requested plugin.
-f : if specified any existing plugin will be overwritten.
PLUGIN_ID : the required numeric plugin identifier from the
JetBrains marketplace. For example, to add
Dart
use 6351 as the PLUGIN_ID. To add
Cloud Code for IntelliJ
use 8079 as the PLUGIN_ID.
For example, to install the latest version of the Dart plugin in IntelliJ run the following command:
/installer-scripts/plugin-installer.sh -d /opt/ideaIU/plugins/ 6351
Use the JetBrains installer script
We recommended that you use the JetBrains installer script when
extending a preconfigured base image
for JetBrains IDEs.
The jetbrains-installer.sh script uses the following syntax:
jetbrains-installer.sh IDE [ pinned | latest ]
Replace the following:
IDE : the JetBrains IDE to install. You must use one
of the following IDE abbreviations:
IDE
Product Installed
cl
CLion
clion
CLion
go
GoLand
goland
GoLand
iiu
Intellij Ultimate
intellij
Intellij Ultimate
pcp
PyCharm Professional
pycharm
PyCharm Professional
ps
PHPStorm
phpstorm
PHPStorm
rd
Rider
rider
Rider
rm
RubyMine
rubymine
RubyMine
ws
WebStorm
webstorm
WebStorm
pinned|latest : Optional - Use either the pinned or
latest version of the IDE. Defaults to latest .
For example, to install the latest version of the Clion, run the following
command:
/installer-scripts/jetbrains-installer.sh clion
Customize JetBrains IDE configuration files
If a persistent home directory is specified in the workstations
configuration, Cloud Workstations base images with JetBrains IDEs
automatically persist the $IDE.vmoptions and $IDE.properties configuration
files. To override the default location of these files, specify
the CLOUD_WORKSTATIONS_JETBRAINS_PERISTED_CONFIG_DIR environment variable.
For more information, Refer to
/etc/workstation-startup.d/120_persist-jetbrains-configs.sh in any
JetBrains base image to learn
how Cloud Workstations sets this up by default.
Extend a base Docker image with Cloud Code for IntelliJ
The following Dockerfile snippet extends a base Docker image with
Cloud Code for IntelliJ by including 8079 as the required plugin identifier.
The example also optionally specifies version 22.9.3-222 as the version
number, /opt/ideaIU/plugins/ as the destination directory, and
89628279ed9042c526a81facc09bf53f8fb8b83b4595b0d329d94c1611e0c379 as the
checksum:
...
# Install IDE and Plugins
RUN bash /installer-scripts/jetbrains-installer.sh intellij pinned && \
# Install Cloud Code - https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8079-cloud-code
bash /installer-scripts/plugin-installer.sh \
-v 22.9.3-222 \
-d /opt/ideaIU/plugins/ \
-c 89628279ed9042c526a81facc09bf53f8fb8b83b4595b0d329d94c1611e0c379 \
8079
# Register IDE with JetBrains Gateway
RUN echo 'runuser user -c "/opt/ideaIU/bin/remote-dev-server.sh registerBackendLocationForGateway"' > /etc/workstation-startup.d/110_register-intellij-with-gateway.sh \
echo 'echo "IntelliJ-Ultimate ready for incoming gateway connection"' >> /etc/workstation-startup.d/110_register-intellij-with-gateway.sh
...
Install additional IDE extensions in Code OSS for Cloud Workstations
Find additional IDE extensions on the
Open VSX Registry .
You can also find the URL of the .vsix file by copying the URL from the
Download link for any extension.
If you open the
Extensions Marketplace from a
workstation, Install appears instead of Download .
Default Code OSS for Cloud Workstations settings
For detailed information about storage of settings in Code OSS for Cloud Workstations,
see Customize settings .
If you specify a persistent home directory in the workstations configuration,
you can configure default settings for Code OSS for Cloud Workstations by adding a
startup script
that writes settings to
$HOME/.codeoss-cloudworkstations/data/Machine/settings.json .
For example, if you want to set the default color theme to Dark, extend the base
editor image to include the following script under
/etc/workstation-startup.d/150_default-ide-color-theme.sh
cat <<< $( jq '. += {"workbench.colorTheme": "Default Dark Modern"}' settings.json ) > settings.json
Build a custom container image
For detailed information about Docker commands, see the
Docker reference .
Enter the following command to build your container:
docker build CUSTOM_IMAGE_FOLDER -t TARGET_IMAGE
Note that replacing the text that precedes the
edit
Edit icon updates the other examples on this page.
Replace the following:
CUSTOM_IMAGE_FOLDER : the path to the
folder that you created to store your custom image.
TARGET_IMAGE : the path to your image in Artifact Registry.
For example, TARGET_IMAGE might point to a target image
path similar the following path:
* .pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-external/customimage:latest
Replace * as needed with the name of the region and
any additional identifiers.
You can also update the CLOUD_WORKSTATIONS_CUSTOM_IMAGE environment variable
to point to the repository.
For more information about storing Docker images in Artifact Registry, see the
following sections:
How to
Create a Docker repository with Artifact Registry .
Naming conventions for
repository and image names .
Host your custom container image
To host custom container images, we recommend and support Artifact Registry.
If you use GitHub or any other public or private repository, Cloud Workstations
might not work as expected. For more information, see the important note in the
Use a custom container image
section.
Test your custom container image
After your container finishes building, you can test it with the following
command:
docker run --privileged -p LOCAL_PORT : CONTAINER_PORT TARGET_IMAGE
Replace the following:
LOCAL_PORT : the local port number
CONTAINER_PORT : the container port number
For example, replacing
LOCAL_PORT : CONTAINER_PORT with
8080 : 80 assigns port 8080 for use locally and port 80 for use in
the container.
If you're extending the Cloud Workstations base editor image, run the docker
command and then test the workstation image by connecting to the workstation
through your local browser or by running ssh to connect to your container:
If you connect through your browser, make sure that you pass -p 8080:80 to
your docker run command and then open
localhost:8080 .
If you prefer to connect through SSH, make sure that you pass -p 2222:22
to your docker run command and then run ssh user@localhost -p 2222 .
Use a custom container image
To use your custom container image after you have built and tested it locally,
push your container to Artifact Registry with the following
command:
docker push TARGET_IMAGE
You can now
create a workstation configuration
using the container image you just created and pushed.
Important: If your image is hosted in a private repository, be sure that your
workstation configuration also specifies a
service account
that has pull permissions on the repository.
For more information, see
Create a Docker repository with Artifact Registry .
Debug issues
To find and debug issues running your container image, review the
container output logs
from your running workstations.
Recommended: help secure your image pipeline
You're responsible for maintaining and updating custom packages and
dependencies added on custom images.
If you're creating custom images, we recommend the following:
Run a container scanning tool such as
Artifact Analysis
to inspect any additional dependencies you added.
Schedule builds
to rebuild images weekly, or learn how to
automate container image rebuilds .
What's next
Automate container image rebuilds
to synchronize base image updates using Cloud Build and Cloud Scheduler.
