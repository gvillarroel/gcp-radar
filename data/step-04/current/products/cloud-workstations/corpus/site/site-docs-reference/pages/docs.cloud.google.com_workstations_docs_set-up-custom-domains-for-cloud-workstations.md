Set up custom domains for Cloud Workstations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
To access your workstations, you can specify a trusted, custom domain rather
than using the cloudworkstations.dev domain.
Architecture
To use Cloud Workstations with a custom hostname,
set up a private cluster
and
set up the Private Service Connect (PSC) endpoint
for HTTP ingress for your private cluster. You must also create a
Application Load Balancer with PSC backend that targets the PSC endpoint created
for your private cluster. This Application Load Balancer can be either external or
internal, and manages the SSL certificate for your custom domain.
The following diagram illustrates a cluster with a custom domain:
Figure 1. Cluster with custom domain
Before you begin
To set up a Cloud Workstations custom domain, follow these steps:
Create a private cluster
and specify a trusted, custom domain using the gcloud CLI or
REST API commands.
Important:
The domain is an immutable field and cannot be changed after
creation.
Make sure that you add the --enable-private-endpoint
flag because to use custom domains, you must enable private clusters.
We recommend specifying a domain that will be used exclusively for
the workstation cluster. If you are planning to host multiple
workstation clusters, we recommend using a separate domain for each
cluster—for example, us-west1-cluster1.example.com .
Create a global external Application Load Balancer with a Private Service Connect
(PSC) backend
in the same project you used for the workstation cluster project.
Note the following:
If you want your workstations to be private (inaccessible through the
public internet), make sure that you create an internal load balancer.
To do so, create a private DNS zone and add a record that maps the
domain to the internal IP address used by the load balancer.
For more information about how to create an internal load balancer, see
the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) .
The service attachment that you need to reference in the load balancer
can be obtained on the workstation cluster resource after you create the
cluster.
Make sure that you obtain a certificate and specify it on the load
balancer as a wildcard certificate for your domain—for example,
*.us-west1-cluster1.example.com . See
Certificates and Google Cloud load balancers
for the types of certificates that are supported for the load balancer
that you selected.
You can also create the load balancer in a different project as long as
you add it to the PrivateClusterConfig.allowedProjects list.
If you have multiple workstation clusters in your organization, you can
use a single load balancer with separate backend services, certificates,
and routing rules.
Set up a Domain Name System
(DNS). Because this is a domain you manage, set up a DNS for this domain by
mapping all subdomains of the provided domain to the load balancer. For
example, create a DNS zone for us-west1-cluster1.example.com and add an
entry mapping *.us-west1-cluster1.example.com to the external IP address
used by your load balancer.
To access workstations using the custom domain, use the cluster you created
to create a workstation configuration ,
and then create a workstation
using that workstation configuration.
Start your workstation and check the URL. When you specify a custom domain,
the workstation URL uses the following format:
https:// PORT - WORKSTATION_NAME . DOMAIN
The following parts of the URL depend on your configuration:
PORT : the port number, which is port 80 by default.
WORKSTATION_NAME : your workstation name.
DOMAIN : your cluster-specific domain name
Create a private cluster
Create a private workstation cluster with a private endpoint:
gcloud
Before you begin, be sure that you
initialized the gcloud CLI by
running gcloud init and that you specified a default project.
The examples that follow assume that you've set your default project.
To create a private workstation cluster, run the following command:
gcloud workstations clusters create WORKSTATION_CLUSTER \
--region= REGION \
--domain= DOMAIN \
--network= NETWORK \
--subnetwork= SUBNETWORK \
--enable-private-endpoint
Replace the following:
WORKSTATION_CLUSTER : the name of the workstation cluster
to create.
REGION : the name of the region of the cluster.
DOMAIN : the domain name used by Cloud Workstations for
HTTP ingress. Use a subdomain unique to this cluster-for
example, us-west1-cluster1.example.com .
NETWORK : the name of the VPC network. If omitted,
the default VPC is used.
SUBNETOWRK : the name of the subnetwork in the VPC
network. If both network and subnetwork are omitted, the default VPC
is used, and the default subnetwork in the specified REGION is used.
For more information about this gcloud CLI command, see the
gcloud workstations clusters create
reference documentation.
curl
curl - H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" - H "Content-Type: application/json" - d ' { "domain_config" : { "domain" : " DOMAIN " }, "private_cluster_config" : { "enable_private_endpoint" : true }, "network" : " NETWORK " , "subnetwork" : " SUBNETWORK " } ' h tt ps : //workstations.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NAME /locations/ REGION /workstationClusters?workstation_cluster_id= WORKSTATION_CLUSTER
Replace the following:
DOMAIN : the domain name used by Cloud Workstations for
HTTP ingress. This should be a subdomain unique to this cluster-for
example, us-west1-cluster1.example.com .
NETWORK : the name of the VPC network. If omitted,
the default VPC is used.
SUBNETOWRK : the name of the subnetwork in the VPC
network. If both network and subnetwork are omitted, the default VPC
is used, and the default subnetwork in the specified REGION is used.
PROJECT_NAME : the name of the project.
REGION : the name of the region of the cluster.
WORKSTATION_CLUSTER : the name of the workstation cluster
to create.

Create a global external Application Load Balancer with PSC backend
Follow these gcloud CLI and REST API steps to create a
global external Application Load Balancer with a PSC backend:
Create a NEG to connect to a published service
Add a backend to a global external Application Load Balancer
Create a URL map to route incoming requests to the backend service
Create a target HTTPS proxy
Create a global address
Create a forwarding rule
Note: The steps for creating a global external Application Load Balancer with PSC backend are provided
as an example to get started. There are a various other types of load balancers
you can choose based on your requirements. For more information about the available
load balancer configurations, see the
Cloud Load Balancing overview . Note: If you require data residency
for data in transit, use a regional external Application Load Balancer instead.
Create a NEG to connect to a published service
When you create a NEG that points to a published service, you need the service
attachment URI for the service. The service attachment has this format:
projects/ SERVICE_PROJECT /regions/ REGION /serviceAttachments/ SERVICE_NAME .
You can find the URI on the workstation cluster resource.
gcloud
gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups create NEG_NAME \
--network-endpoint-type=private-service-connect \
--psc-target-service= TARGET_SERVICE \
--region= REGION \
--subnet= SUBNET
Replace the following:
NEG_NAME : a name for the network endpoint group.
TARGET_SERVICE : the URI of the service attachment.
REGION : the region to create the network endpoint
group in. The region must be the same region as the target service.
SUBNET : the subnet to create the network endpoint
group in. The subnet must be in the same region as the target service. A
subnet must be provided if you provide the network. If both network and
subnet are omitted, the default network is used, and the default subnet
in the specified REGION is used.
For more information about this gcloud CLI command, see the
gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups create
reference documentation.
REST
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NAME /regions/ REGION /networkEndpointGroups

--protocol=HTTPS \
--global
Replace BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME with the name of the
backend service.
Add the Private Service Connect NEG that points to the
target service.
gcloud compute backend-services add-backend BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--network-endpoint-group= NEG_NAME \
--network-endpoint-group-region= NEG_REGION \
--global
Replace the following:
BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME : the name of the backend service.
