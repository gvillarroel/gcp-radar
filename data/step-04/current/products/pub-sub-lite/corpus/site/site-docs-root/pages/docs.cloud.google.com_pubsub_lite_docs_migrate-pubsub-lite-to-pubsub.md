Migrate from Pub/Sub Lite to Pub/Sub
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: Pub/Sub Lite is deprecated. Effective June 30, 2026,
Pub/Sub Lite will be turned down.
Current customers: Pub/Sub Lite remains functional until June 30, 2026.
If you have not used Pub/Sub Lite within the 90-day period preceding July 15, 2025
(April 15, 2025 - July 15, 2025), you won't be able to access Pub/Sub Lite starting on
July 15, 2025.
New customers: Pub/Sub Lite is no longer available for new customers after September 24, 2024.
You can migrate your Pub/Sub Lite service to
Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka
or Pub/Sub .
This document provides information on how to migrate your Pub/Sub Lite
applications and data from Pub/Sub Lite to Pub/Sub.
To migrate
to Pub/Sub, you use the Pub/Sub Lite export
subscription feature. The export subscription
feature converts messages from a Pub/Sub Lite to a Pub/Sub message,
using a type of subscription called an export subscription .
Differences between Pub/Sub Lite and Pub/Sub
Pub/Sub and Pub/Sub Lite are both horizontally scalable
messaging services, but each service has key differences in how they work.
To understand these differences in detail, read Choose Pub/Sub or
Pub/Sub Lite .
The following sections outline some of the key differences between each service
that are relevant when migrating between services. These include the following
considerations:
Data locality and replication
Delivery modes
Parallelism and ordering
Replay and purge
Capacity management and Pricing
Data locality and replication
Pub/Sub Lite . Regional Pub/Sub Lite topics replicate
data to a secondary zone within the same region. Zonal Pub/Sub Lite
topics store data in a single zone without replication.
Pub/Sub . Pub/Sub replicates data across three zones
within a region.
Key migration point
It's important to understand how each service replicates data differently.
When using Pub/Sub, you can ensure that your data is stored in preferred
regions by using Pub/Sub message storage
policies .
Pub/Sub doesn't provide control over the specific zones where
messages are stored. Instead, it always replicates data across three zones
within a region as dictated by the message storage policy.
If you don't specify a message storage policy, Pub/Sub automatically
determines where messages are stored based on your Resource Location
Restriction organization
policy . If
you don't explicitly set an organization policy, Pub/Sub allows all
regions and automatically selects one to store messages in.
Delivery modes
Pub/Sub Lite . For message delivery, Pub/Sub Lite only
supports the StreamingPull RPC API.
Pub/Sub . For message delivery, Pub/Sub offers multiple
message delivery options , including
StreamingPull message delivery.
Key migration point
If you want to replicate Pub/Sub Lite behavior in Pub/Sub (for
example, low latency and high efficiency), implement your consumer clients using
the StreamingPull API. Alternatively, you can implement your Pub/Sub
subscription using other available delivery modes such as Push
delivery .
Parallelism and ordering
Pub/Sub Lite . Pub/Sub Lite supports parallelism per
partition.
Pub/Sub . Pub/Sub supports parallelism per message.
Key migration point
Pub/Sub isn't a partition-based solution. Pub/Sub messages can also be
processed concurrently, meaning that the message order is not guaranteed. If
your application requires message ordering, use Pub/Sub ordering
keys .
When using the export subscription in Pub/Sub Lite, the
Pub/Sub Lite key is used as the ordering key in the Pub/Sub
Message. This ensures that the messages continue to be delivered in order.
To ensure compatibility with Pub/Sub messages, verify that your
Pub/Sub Lite keys contain only UTF-8 encoded characters.
Pub/Sub Lite keys are stored as bytes.
Pub/Sub ordering keys are stored as strings.
Pub/Sub ordering keys have a maximum publisher throughput of 1 MBps.
Message ordering in Pub/Sub is only guaranteed within a single region.
To receive ordered messages in Pub/Sub, you must explicitly enable
message ordering in the subscription settings.
Replay and purge
Pub/Sub Lite . Pub/Sub Lite supports the seek
feature without requiring additional configuration.
Pub/Sub . Pub/Sub supports the seek feature but requires
additional configuration to set it up.
Key migration point
To enable the seek feature, Pub/Sub requires you to explicitly configure
settings on both the topic and the subscription.
Topic: You must configure a message retention duration
Subscription: You must configure an acknowledged message retention.
Configuring these settings is crucial if you need exact parity with
Pub/Sub Lite or if your migration requires message replay or purging.
Regardless of your specific requirements, the ability to seek and reprocess
messages is a valuable safeguard during a phased migration. It enables rollback
and minimizes data loss if unexpected issues arise.
Capacity management and Pricing
Pub/Sub Lite . Pub/Sub Lite capacity is manually
provisioned by configuring storage and throughput capacity using Pub/Sub Lite
reservations .
Pub/Sub . Pub/Sub is fully managed and scales automatically.
Key migration point
When transitioning to Pub/Sub, you can manage capacity and pricing by
setting quota overrides or by requesting a quota change for your Pub/Sub
resources.
The primary reason to manage Pub/Sub capacity is to adhere to strict
cost requirements. If you don't have any strict cost limits, Pub/Sub can
efficiently manage resources without much intervention. Pub/Sub is
billed based on usage. For detailed information, see Pub/Sub
pricing .
Plan a migration
To migrate from Pub/Sub Lite to Pub/Sub, you can use the
Pub/Sub Lite export subscription feature. Export subscription lets you
migrate your Pub/Sub Lite application in phases. Adopting a phased approach lets
you update, test, and monitor your migration iteratively, minimizing the risk of
errors and downtime.
Before you begin
Evaluate your existing Pub/Sub Lite application and map out the
corresponding Pub/Sub features that you need.
Ensure that Pub/Sub meets all of your functional and business
requirements.
Phased migration workflow
The following steps provide an overview of the export subscription migration workflow.
Create the relevant Pub/Sub topics and a subscription
to the topic.
Create a Pub/Sub Lite export subscription .
Subscribe to both Pub/Sub and Pub/Sub Lite
subscriptions.
Gradually update publishers to send messages to
the Pub/Sub topic instead of the Pub/Sub Lite topic.
Verify that the migrated workload is working as intended.
Turn down Pub/Sub Lite publishers and subscribers.
Migration phases
The following sections provide details on each step in the phased migration
workflow.
Create Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions
Create a corresponding Pub/Sub topic and its subscription.
In this phase, you configure required topics and subscriptions
settings, such as message retention, message acknowledgment and message storage
policies.
If required, establish and set up quotas to prevent overuse and unexpected
billing. Most importantly, we strongly recommend you to set up a dead-letter
Pub/Sub Lite topic to capture any messages that fail to migrate
successfully to Pub/Sub. This lets you troubleshoot errors and
identify the root cause of export failures and resend failed messages to the
correct topic, ensuring no data loss.
Create Pub/Sub Lite export subscriptions
For every topic, create a Pub/Sub Lite export subscription to export
messages from the Pub/Sub Lite topic to its corresponding Pub/Sub topic.
Instead of individually setting throughput capacity for each export
subscription, use a Pub/Sub Lite reservation to efficiently manage throughput for all your
export subscriptions collectively. By the end of this phase, your
Pub/Sub Lite and Pub/Sub
topics both receive the same messages from the point the export subscriptions were
created.
You can then use the Pub/Sub topics to incrementally
develop and test your subscriber clients in isolated phases. This approach
minimizes disruption to your existing Pub/Sub Lite applications.
Dual-subscribe to Pub/Sub Lite and Pub/Sub topics
In a development environment, update your subscriber clients to read messages
directly from Pub/Sub topics, using the appropriate Pub/Sub
client library . Unlike Pub/Sub Lite, Pub/Sub offers multiple. Unlike Pub/Sub Lite, Pub/Sub offers multiple
delivery modes (pull and push), so choose the one that best aligns with your
application's requirements.
To emulate the same behavior as Pub/Sub Lite, configure your
Pub/Sub instance with the StreamingPull API.
In a system with multiple consumer applications, gradually migrate each
application one-by-one. For each subscriber application, run the
Pub/Sub Lite subscriber and the new Pub/Sub subscriber in
parallel, so you can verify the behavior and performance of the new
subscriber. Closely monitor both subscribers to ensure message delivery
consistency, error handling and overall functionality. After all subscribers
are successfully migrated and validated, decommission the old Pub/Sub Lite
subscriber clients.
Update publishers
After all your subscribers are successfully consuming messages from
Pub/Sub, you can gradually update your publishers to send
messages directly to Pub/Sub topics. To do this, update your publishers
to use the Pub/Sub client libraries . This ensures that you can
gradually shift traffic from Pub/Sub Lite to Pub/Sub.
Turn down Pub/Sub Lite
After you have successfully migrated all your subscribers and publishers to
Pub/Sub, you can shut down your Pub/Sub Lite resources. This
helps you avoid incurring unnecessary costs for unused infrastructure.
