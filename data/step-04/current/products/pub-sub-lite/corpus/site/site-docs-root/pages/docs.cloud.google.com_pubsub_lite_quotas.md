Pub/Sub Lite quotas and limits
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides information about quotas and resource
limits for Pub/Sub Lite. Unless mentioned otherwise,
Pub/Sub Lite topics refer to both
zonal and regional Lite topics.
Key Point: You can request increases to quotas, but limits cannot be adjusted.
Overview of quotas and limits
Google Cloud uses quotas to restrict how much of a particular shared
Google Cloud resource that you can use. Each quota represents a specific
countable resource, such as API calls to a particular service, the number of
bytes sent to a particular service, or the storage used by your project.
Many services also have system limits.
These are fixed constraints, such as maximum message sizes or the number of
Pub/Sub Lite resources you can create in a project,
which cannot be increased or decreased.
Pub/Sub Lite quotas
Quotas apply to the following properties of a Pub/Sub Lite
service:
Throughput for a zone in case of a zonal Lite topic without reservations and throughput reservation capacity units in a region
Storage for a region
Rate of administrative Pub/Sub Lite requests for a project
Throughput quotas
Regional Lite topic require throughput reservations. Zonal Lite topics
can use reservations or allocate throughput capacity directly to a topic.
Zonal Lite topics without reservations consume publish and
subscribe throughput quota of their respective zones. Lite topic
with reservations only consume throughput quota through their
reservations.
The following default quotas apply to each project and location :
Resource quota
Location type
Value
Reservation throughput
region
128 capacity units
Publishing throughput for zonal Lite topics without reservations
zone
64 MiBps
Subscribing throughput for zonal Lite topics without reservations
zone
128 MiBps
Storage quotas
The storage of both zonal and regional Lite topics in a project counts towards
the same regional quota. A regional Lite topic stores data in two zones in a
region, whereas a zonal Lite topic stores data only in one zone in a region.
For example, if you create a zonal Lite topic with one partition containing 30
GiB of storage space, you use 30 GiB of your storage quota. Alternatively,
if you create a regional Lite topic with one partition containing 30 GiB of
storage space, you use 60 GiB (30 x 2) of your storage quota.
Lite topics store messages in partitions, and each message uses 256 bytes
to 10 MiB of storage space. If the message is larger than 256 bytes, then
the size of the message is the sum of the following:
The number of bytes in the encoded message body string
The number of bytes in the key and value of each attribute
The number of bytes in the ordering key
12 bytes for the event timestamp
For more information about the message format, see the message resource in the Pub/Sub Lite API reference .
The following default quotas apply to each project and location :
Resource quota
Location type
Value
Storage
region
20 TiB
Rate quotas
The following quotas apply to Pub/Sub Lite requests in each region:
Quota
Value
Description
Administrative read requests per min
600
Getting and listing Lite topics and Lite subscriptions
Administrative write requests per min
600
Creating, updating, and deleting Lite topics and Lite subscriptions, or manually changing the offset of a committed cursor.
Message stats computation requests per min
600
Computing backlog statistics
Head cursor computation requests per min
600
Computing the current head cursor
These quotas apply to each Google Cloud console project and are shared across all
applications using that project.
Quota increases
If you want to increase any of your quotas for Pub/Sub Lite, you can
use the Google Cloud console to request a quota increase. For details, see
Request a quota adjustment .
Pub/Sub Lite limits
As mentioned before, you cannot increase resources that have limits.
Subscription limits
Pub/Sub Lite enforces a limit of 1,000 Lite subscriptions for
a Lite topic.
