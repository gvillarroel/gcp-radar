Description
Supports remote transcoding
BigQuery commands
bq export
Use this command to create a binary file. The command accepts a
COPYBOOK DD
as input.
Note: We recommend that you use the qsam decode and qsam encode commands to
perform this task. For information on the advantages of using the
qsam commands, see Advantages of qsam commands .
The bq export command supports some performance tuning
capabilities. For more information, see
Performance improvements for the
bq export command . You can use customized character
sets with the bq export command. For more information, see
Use customized character sets .
Note: The bq export command fails requests
to export large Bigtable tables. To avoid errors, add the
-allowLargeResults flag to the bq export
command when you want to export large tables.
Yes
bq load
Use this command to load data into a table.
No
bq mk
Use this command to create BigQuery resources, such as
built-in tables or external tables, that need partitioning and clustering to
be set up.
You can also use the bq mk command to generate a
BigQuery table directly from parsing COBOL copybooks. For more
information, see Create a
BigQuery table from a copybook .
No
bq query
Use this command to create a query job that runs the specified SQL
query. The command reads the SQL query either from the --sql
flag or from QUERY DD .
If both are provided, the query in the --sql flag takes
precedence.
Use the --follow=true flag to generate a report that displays
the results of a select query. In order to write this report to a file in
the mainframe, define a DD statement AUDITL that points to the
file that should contain the audit logs report. Don't use the
--follow flag if you want normal logging behavior.
Some query results may return a large number of rows, sometimes in millions.
In order for the output to remain human readable the number of lines
displayed is capped. To control the number of rows being displayed, use the
--report_row_limit flag. For example, use
--report_row_limit 10 to limit the results to 10 lines. By
default, the number of lines displayed is limited to 30.
To use bq query parameterization, see bq query parameterization .
Yes
bq rm
Use this command to permanently delete a BigQuery
resource. As this command permanently deletes a resource, we recommend that
you use it with caution.
No
Cloud Run commands
cloud run job execute
Use this command to trigger a Cloud Run job from your
Mainframe.
No
cloud run job logs
Use this command to view the logs for a specific Cloud Run
job execution.
No
cloud run job cancel
Use this command to cancel a Cloud Run job.
No
Cloud Storage commands
scp
Use this command to copy text or binary data to Cloud Storage.
You can use the simple binary copy mode to
copy a dataset from IBM z/OS
to Cloud Storage unmodified as part of a data pipeline. Optionally,
you can convert the character encoding from extended binary coded decimal
interchange code (EBCDIC) to ASCII UTF-8, and add line breaks.
Note: We recommend that you use the copy text commands to perform
this task as it provides better capabilities.
You can also use this command to copy application source code defined in
job control language (JCL) .
No
gsutil utility
gsutil cp
Use this command to transcode a dataset and write it to
Cloud Storage in the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC)
file format. The command reads the data from the INFILE DD , and the record layout from the
COPYBOOK file .
Note: We recommend that you use the qsam decode and qsam encode commands to
perform this task. For information on the advantages of using the
qsam commands, see Advantages of qsam commands .
If you want the command to read the data from a Data Source Name (DSN) file,
use the following flags:
--inDsn : the input dataset DSN. If provided, this flag
overrides INFILE DD.
--cobDsn : the copybook DSN. If provided, this flag
overrides COPYBOOK DD.
The command then opens a configurable number of parallel connections to the
Cloud Storage API and transcodes the COBOL dataset to the columnar
and GZIP compressed ORC file format. You can expect about 35% compression
ratio.
Optionally, you can use this command to interact with the
Mainframe Connector gRPC
service running on a VM on the mainframe. To do so, set the
SRVHOST and SRVPORT environment variables, or
provide the hostname and port number using command line options. When the
gRPC service is used, the input dataset is first copied to
Cloud Storage by the Mainframe Connector, and then a
remote procedure (RPC) call is made to instruct the gRPC service to
transcode the file.
You can also perform the following tasks with the gsutil cp
command:
Perform a dry run of the gsutil cp command
Copy a file from Cloud Storage to your Mainframe
Fine tune performance of the gsutil cp command
Use customized character sets with the gsutil cp .
Yes
gsutil rm
Use this command to delete buckets or objects within a bucket.
No
gszutil utility
gszutil
The gszutil utility runs using the IBM JZOS Java SDK and
provides a shell emulator that accepts gsutil and
BigQuery command line invocations using JCL.
Note: We recommend that you use the qsam decode and qsam encode commands to
perform this task. For information on the advantages of using the
qsam commands, see Advantages of qsam commands .
The gszutil utility extends the functionality of the
gsutil utility by accepting a schema in the form of a
COPYBOOK DD ,
using it to transcode COBOL datasets directly to ORC before uploading to
Cloud Storage. The gszutil utility also lets you
execute BigQuery query and load
using JCL.
The gszutil utility works with the gRPC
server, which helps you reduce the million instructions per second (MIPS)
consumption. We recommend using the gszutil utility in your
production environment to convert binary files in Cloud Storage to
the ORC format.
No
qsam and vsam commands
qsam decode
Use this command to transcode QSAM file records to the format you want
using the --output-format argument. The original QSAM file is
split into chunks based on the value you specify with the
--max-chunk-size argument. The transcoded output is saved in
the target path as lexicographically sorted files.
No
qsam encode
Use this command to convert data from an external source to a QSAM file.
The input is defined by the value you specify using the
--input-format argument.
No
vsam decode
Use this command to transcode Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) file
records to the format you want using the --output-format
argument. The original VSAM file is split into chunks based on the value you
specify with the --max-chunk-size argument. The transcoded
output is saved in the target path as lexicographically sorted files.
No
Pub/Sub commands
pubsub topics publish
Use this command to publish a message to a Pub/Sub topic.
No
Other commands
copy binary
Use this command to copy a binary dataset from a source path to a
destination path.
No
copy text
Use this command to copy a file to a storage location of your choice,
such as Cloud Storage, and the other way around.
No
curl
Use this command to make an HTTP request to a web service or REST APIs.
No
gcloud dataflow flex-template run
Use this command to trigger the execution of a Dataflow flex
template. The command runs a job from the specified flex template path. For
more information, see gcloud dataflow flex-template run .
No
systemreport
Use this command to print the necessary system data to the standard
output (stdout). This allows the Mainframe Connector support
team to gather the required information to diagnose an issue without the
need for extensive customer interaction.
Based on the flag you use, the systemreport command prints the
following system data:
--supported_ciphers : Supported ciphers
--available_security_providers : Available security providers
No
Use customized character sets
Mainframe Connector supports different character sets that decode
bytes into BigQuery strings, and the other way around.
Mainframe Connector lets you configure your own customized
charset. You can configure a customized character set by building a Unicode
Character Mapping (UCM) file. Mainframe Connector supports the
following subset of the UCM format:
<code_set_name> "<name>"
<uconv_class> "SBCS"
<subchar> \x1A #Example
CHARMAP
#_______ _________
<U0000> \x00 |0 #For the third column, only 0 is supported.
<U0001> \x01 |0
#etc
END CHARMAP
If you want to use a customized character set, define a configuration file in
the UCM format. You can use this customized character set with the
gsutil cp or
bq export
commands by setting the --encoding= charset flag.
When you create a customized character set, verify the following:
While defining a UCM file, keep the following in mind:
Mainframe Connector only supports customized character sets
using a single byte character set (SBCS).
Mainframe Connector only supports the UCM precision indicator
|0 .
Verify that the UCM files are located in the z/OS Unix System Services (USS)
and not on a multiple virtual storage partitioned dataset (MVS PDS).
Verify that the UCM files are saved in American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII) format and not in the Extended Binary Coded
Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) format.
Provide explicit mapping for every possible single byte value to a Unicode
character. If you're unsure about which Unicode character you want to map a
byte to, we recommend that you map it to U+FFFD . You can map
different byte sequences to the same Unicode character. However, in these
cases the mapping is not bidirectional, that is, when you load data to
BigQuery and later export it back to a binary file, the output
might differ from the original input.
Verify that the byte sequences in the second column are unique. If multiple
byte sequences map to the same Unicode character, this Unicode character is
decoded to a byte sequence of the last defined mapping in the UCM file.
Verify that Mainframe Connector can find the UCM file by
setting the environment variable BQSH_FEATURE_CUSTOM_CHARSET to the UCM file's path. If
you want to use multiple character sets, you can provide the paths to multiple
characters sets separated by the semi-colon delimiter. For example, BQSH_FEATURE_CUSTOM_CHARSET= path1;path2 . path
can either point to a local file or to a file stored on Cloud Storage.
If you execute the gsutil cp or bq export commands
with the --remote flag to perform remote transcoding , Mainframe Connector uses the local value
set for the BQSH_FEATURE_CUSTOM_CHARSET environment variable. The
same applies when you run Mainframe Connector in
standalone mode . If the
--encoding flag refers to a customized character set that doesn't
correspond to the value you set for BQSH_FEATURE_CUSTOM_CHARSET
(or if you've not set BQSH_FEATURE_CUSTOM_CHARSET at all), the
command exits with an error message.
Performance tuning configuration for the bq export command
Mainframe Connector supports the following performance tuning
configuration for the bq export command:
exporter_thread_count : (Optional) Set the number of worker
threads. The default value is 4.
max_read_streams : (Optional) Set the maximum read streams. The
default value is the same as that of the value set for
exporter_thread_count .
order_response : (Optional) If you set this flag to true, the
exporter retains the query result order. This flag affects the export
performance. The default value is false.
max_read_queue : (Optional) Set the maximum number of read record
queues. The default value is twice the number of threads.
transcoding_buffer : (Optional) Set the size of the transcoding
buffer per thread in MBs. The default value is 20 MB.
Note that you can also try increasing the transport window size by setting the
OVERRIDE_GRPC_WINDOW_MB
environment variable to improve performance. The default window size is 4 MB.
Create a BigQuery table from a copybook
You can use the bq mk command to generate a BigQuery
table directly from parsing COBOL copybooks. The native copybook parser extracts
default values from the VALUE clause within a copybook, and assigns
them to the corresponding columns in a newly created BigQuery
table.
Note: This feature is not supported by the legacy parser.
To help you test this feature, the bq mk command also provides
a dry run mode. This mode lets you preview the generated
CREATE TABLE SQL command without actually creating the table in
BigQuery.
The bq mk command provides the following configuration options to
support this feature:
--schema_from_copybook : Specifies the copybook to use to create
the table.
--dry_run : (Optional) When enabled, the command only prints the
generated CREATE TABLE SQL command without executing it. This
flag is set to false by default.
--tablespec "[PROJECT_ID]:[DATASET].[TABLE]" : Specifies the
BigQuery project ID, dataset, and table name for the target
table.
--encoding : Specifies the encoding used to read the copybook
file. The default value is CP037 .
The following VALUE clauses are supported:
VAR1 PIC 9(5) VALUE 55.
*-- Set VAR1 to 55
VAR1 PIC X(5) VALUE aaaa. Set VAR1 to aaaa
VAR1 PIC 9(3) COMP VALUE 3. Set VAR1 to 3 (binary)
VAR1 PIC [9(5), X(5)] VALUE <literal>. Set VAR1 to <literal>
VAR1 PIC [9(5), X(5)] VALUE ZERO. Set VAR1 to 0 or "0"
VAR1 PIC [9(5), X(5)] VALUE ZEROS. Set VAR1 to 0 or "00000"
VAR1 PIC [9(5), X(5)] VALUE ZEROES. Set VAR1 to 0 or "00000"
VAR1 PIC X(5) VALUE SPACE. Set VAR1 to " "
VAR1 PIC X(5) VALUE SPACES. Set VAR1 to " "
HIGH-VALUE and LOW-VALUE clauses are supported for
alphanumeric variables only.
VAR1 PIC X(5) VALUE HIGH-VALUE. Set VAR1 to `X"FF "
VAR1 PIC X(5) VALUE HIGH-VALUES. Set VAR1 to 0 or `X"FFFFFFFFFF"
VAR1 PIC X(5) VALUE LOW-VALUE. Set VAR1 to `X"00" (NULL)
VAR1 PIC X(5) VALUE LOW-VALUES. Set VAR1 to `X"0000000000" (NULL)
VAR1 PIC X(5) VALUE QUOTE. Set VAR1 to `"`
VAR1 PIC X(5) VALUE `QUOTES`. Set VAR1 to 0 or `""""`
VAR1 PIC [9(5), X(5)] VALUE NULL. Not defined and won't be supported
VAR1 PIC [9(5), X(5)] VALUE ALL <literal>. Set all fields with the value ALL to <literal>
bq query parameterization
Mainframe Connector lets you use parameterized queries with
bq query .
The following is an example of how to you can use a parameterized
bq query query:
Query file
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.wikipedia` WHERE title = @xtitle
The following is an example with multiple parameters.
Query file
SELECT * FROM bigquery-public-data.samples.wikipedia WHERE title = @mytitle AND num_characters > @min_chars;
Execution example
bq query \
--project_id=mainframe-connector-dev \
--location="US" \
--parameters=mytitle::Hippocrates,min_chars:INT64:42600
Perform a dry run of the gsutil cp command
The gsutil cp command decodes a QSAM file using a COBOL copybook,
and generates an ORC file on Cloud Storage. You can perform a dry run
of the gsutil cp command using the dry_run flag and
test the following steps:
Parse a COBOL copybook or data file and check whether it is compatible with
Mainframe Connector.
Decode a QSAM file without writing it Cloud Storage.
Use the following command to perform a dry run:
gsutil cp \
--dry_run \
gs://result-dir
If all steps are executed successfully, the command exits with return code 0. If
any issues are encountered, an error message is displayed.
When you use the dry_run flag, all statistics such as total bytes
read, number of written records, total errors, are logged.
If you use the dry_run flag and the data source doesn't exist, the
command doesn't return an error. It instead only checks the copybook parser and
and then completes execution.
Copy a file from Cloud Storage to your Mainframe
You can use the gsutil cp command to copy a file from
Cloud Storage to a Mainframe dataset. Note that you cannot copy
partitioned data sets (PDS).
To copy a file from Cloud Storage to a Mainframe dataset, specify the
DSN and space requirements of the file you want to download to the Mainframe in
JCL, as shown in the following example:
//OUTFILE DD DSN=MAINFRAME.DSN.FILE,DISP=(,CATLG),
// RECFM=FB,DSORG=PS,
// SPACE=(10,(2,1),RLSE),
// AVGREC=M,
// UNIT=SYSDA
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSDUMP DD SYSOUT=*
//STDIN DD *
Specify the gsutil cp command in the following format. If the file
already exists on your Mainframe, verify that you add the --replace
flag to the command.
gsutil cp GCS_URI DSN --recfm= RECFM --lrecl= LRECL --blksize= BLKSIZE --noseek
Replace the following:
GCS_URI : The Cloud Storage uniform resource identifier
(URI) of the Cloud Storage file. For example,
gs://bucket/sample.mainframe.dsn .
DSN : The DSN destination location on the Mainframe.
RECFM : The record format (RECFM) of the Mainframe file. The valid
values are F, FB, and U. Note that these values are case-insensitive.
LRECL : (Optional) The record length (LRECL) of the file. The value
must be an integer >= 0. If LRECL is not specified the file is assumed to be
in the undefined-length record format (U).
BLKSIZE : (Optional) The block-size of the file. If set to 0, the
system will determine the optimal block-size. The value must be an integer >= 0.
If you don't specify a value, the file is treated as an unblocked file.
noseek : (Optional) Include this parameter if you want to improve
download performance. This flag is set to false by default, that is, seek
operations are enabled.
Execution example
gsutil cp gs://sample-bucket/MAINFRAME.DSN.FILE MAINFRAME.DSN.FILE \
--lrecl=16 --blksize=0 --recfm=fb
Performance tuning configuration for the gsutil cp command
Mainframe Connector supports the following performance tuning
configuration for the gsutil cp command.
Use the --parallelism flag to set the number of threads. The
default value is 1 (single threaded).
Use the --maxChunkSize argument to set the maximum size of each
chunk. Each chunk will have its own ORC file. Increase this value to reduce
the number of chunks created at the cost of larger memory requirements during
the transcoding process. For details, see Parse the maxChunkSize argument . The default value is 128 MiB.
Use --preload_chunk_count argument to set the amount of data to
preload to memory while all workers are busy. This argument can improve
performance at the cost of memory. The default value is 2.
Execution example
gsutil cp \
--replace \
--parser_type=copybook \
--parallelism=8 \
--maxChunkSize=256MiB \
gs://$BUCKET/test.orc
In this example, we've considered a large file and so have used 8 threads at
which line rate is reached. If you have enough memory, we recommend that you
increase the chunk size to 256 MiB or even 512 MiB since it reduces creating
overhead and finalizing Cloud Storage objects. For small files using
less threads and smaller chunks might produce better results.
Parse the maxChunkSize argument
The maxChunkSize flag accepts values in the form of an amount and a
unit of measurement, for example 5 MiB. You can use whitespace between the
amount and magnitude.
You can provide the value in the following formats:
Java format: b/k/m/g/t, for byte, kibibyte, mebibyte, gibibyte, and
tebibyte respectively
International format: KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB, for kibibyte, mebibyte, gibibyte,
and tebibyte respectively
Metric format: b/kb/mb/gb/tb, for kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, and
terabyte respectively
Data size parsing is case insensitive. Note that you can't specify partial
amounts. For example, use 716 KiB instead of 0.7 MiB.
