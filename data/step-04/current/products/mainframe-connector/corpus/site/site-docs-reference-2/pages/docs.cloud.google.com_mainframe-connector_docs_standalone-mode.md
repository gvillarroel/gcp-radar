Run Mainframe Connector in standalone mode
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Mainframe Connector version 5.13.0 and later supports running
Mainframe Connector as a standalone job on Google Cloud. This feature
lets you run Mainframe Connector as a containerized batch job,
for example, as a Cloud Run job, Google Kubernetes Engine job, or within a
Docker container. This option helps you avoid installing
Mainframe Connector locally on your mainframe, and makes it easier for
you to integrate your mainframe queued sequential access method (QSAM) file
parsing to existing extract, transform, and load (ETL) workflows.
When you use the standalone version of the Mainframe Connector, you
must set up the ETL workflow that loads the QSAM file to Google Cloud by
yourself.
Before you begin
Deploy Mainframe Connector on Cloud Run .
Create a service account or identify an
existing service account to use with Mainframe Connector. This
service account must have permissions to access Cloud Storage buckets,
BigQuery datasets, and any other Google Cloud resource that you want
to use.
Ensure that the service account you created is assigned the Cloud Run Invoker role .
Ensure that the mainframe data is already available on Google Cloud as a QSAM
file.
Transcode data using Mainframe Connector in standalone mode on Cloud Run
Mainframe Connector provides two ways in which you can run
Mainframe Connector as a standalone job on Google Cloud:
Using qsam commands (release 5.16.0 and later)
Using the gsutil cp command
Advantages of qsam commands
The qsam commands provide the following advantages:
Support for compound data types, including the OCCURS clause (lists), REDEFINES
clause, and nested records. For more information about these data types, see
qsam and vsam transcoding reference .
Support for the configuration of the transcoding process through a
transcoder configuration file .
This capability offers more flexibility when decoding data to Google Cloud,
and encoding the data back to the mainframe.
Support for the creation of a spillover dataset ,
which is a table of transcoding errors that can be used for error inspection.
Support for multiple input and output formats .
This capability lets you load your data to and from various data warehouses.
Run Mainframe Connector in standalone mode using qsam commands
To transcode your data using Mainframe Connector in standalone mode
using qsam commands, use the following steps:
Create a YAML file with commands to do the following:
Read your dataset
Transcode it to a supported format
Upload it to Cloud Storage
The input dataset must be a QSAM file with fixed or variable record length.
You can use the following sample YAML file to read your dataset, transcode
it to the ORC format, and upload it to Cloud Storage.
In the following sample, we use the Cloud Storage DataPath for INFILE , OUTFILE ,
COPYBOOK , and TRANSCODE_CONFIGURATION .
environmentVariables:
- name: "INFILE"
value: " INFILE "
- name: "OUTFILE"
value: " OUTFILE "
- name: "COPYBOOK"
value: " COPYBOOK "
- name: "TRANSCODE_CONFIGURATION"
value: " TRANSCODE_CONFIGURATION "
- name: "LOG_PROJECT"
value: " LOG_PROJECT "
- name: "IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS"
value: "-XX:+UseContainerSupport"
command:
qsam decode $INFILE $OUTFILE
--copybook $COPYBOOK
--transcode-configuration ${TRANSCODE_CONFIGURATION}
--output-format orc
--parallelism 8
--chunk-size "512Mib"
Replace the following:
INFILE : The name of the input file.
OUTFILE : The name of the output file.
COPYBOOK_PATH : The path to the copybook DD.
TRANSCODE_CONFIGURATION_PATH : The path to the
transcode configuration file.
LOG_PROJECT : The name of the log project.
The following is an example YAML file:
environmentVariables:
- name: "INFILE"
value: "gs://my_bucket/my/input.dat"
- name: "OUTFILE"
value: "gs://my_bucket/my/output.orc"
- name: "COPYBOOK"
value: "gs://my_bucket/my/copybook.cpy"
- name: "TRANSCODE_CONFIGURATION"
value: "gs://my_bucket/my/transcode-configuration-file.json"
- name: "LOG_PROJECT"
value: "the log project"
- name: "IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS"
value: "-XX:+UseContainerSupport"
command:
qsam decode $INFILE $OUTFILE
--copybook $COPYBOOK
--transcode-configuration ${TRANSCODE_CONFIGURATION}
--output-format orc
--parallelism 8
--chunk-size "512Mib"
Note
Variables with the suffix FILLER are ignored during the
import process.
Starting from version 5.12.0, Mainframe Connector replaces
hyphens ("-") with underscores ("_") in variable names. If you want to
keep hyphens in your variable names, disable this automatic conversion
by setting the database variable BQSH_FEATURE_CONVERT_UNDERSCORE_IN_FIELDS_NAME
to false .
Create a job.yaml file with the following command.
kind: Job
metadata:
name: JOB

Replace the following:
JOB : the name of your Cloud Run job.
Job names must be 49 characters or less and must be unique per region and
project.
IMAGE : the URL of job container image, for example,
us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/job:latest .
LOCATION_OF_THE_COMMAND_YAML_FILE : the location of the YAML
file that you created in the previous step.
Deploy the new job using the following command:
gcloud run jobs replace job.yaml
Run the job using the following command:
gcloud run jobs execute JOB_NAME
Replace JOB_NAME with the name of the job.
For more information on creating and executing a Cloud Run
job, see Create a new job and

Replace JOB_NAME with the name of the job.
For more information on creating and executing a Cloud Run
job, see Create a new job and
Execute a job .
Export BigQuery table into Mainframe dataset
You can export BigQuery table into mainframe dataset by creating a YAML
file that executes a SQL read from the QUERY DD file ,
and exports the resulting dataset to Cloud Storage as a binary file, as
follows.
The steps to create and execute the Cloud Run job are the same as
mentioned in the section Transcode data using Mainframe Connector in standalone mode on Cloud Run . The only difference is the instructions
mentioned in the YAML file. Mainframe Connector provides two ways in
which you can export BigQuery table:
Using qsam commands (release 5.16.0 and later)
Using the bq export command
Use qsam commands
