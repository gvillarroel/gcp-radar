This page lists all the environment variables that Mainframe Connector
supports. Depending on the version of the Mainframe Connector, some
variables might not be supported. For more details, see the Available from version
column in the following table.
Name
Default value
Available from version
Description
BQSH_FEATURE_TRIM_STRING_SUFFIX
True
5.8.0
Trims the whitespace at the end of strings. Note that strings that
consist only of whitespaces are treated as empty strings.
ENCODING
cp037
5.8.0
Specifies the character encoding used for encoding and decoding.
BQ_QUERY_REMOTE_EXECUTION
False
5.10.0
Configures bq query to run in remote mode.
BQSH_FEATURE_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ENABLED
False
5.11.0
Enables support for variable-length character strings when set to True.
BQSH_FEATURE_VARIABLE_LENGTH_LEN_SUFFIX
-LEN
5.11.0
Relevant if BQSH_FEATURE_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ENABLED is set.
Represents the suffix of the first parameter in the variable-length
character struct. By default, the suffix is -LEN . If you want
to use a different suffix, set this environment variable to the suffix of
your choice.
BQSH_FEATURE_VARIABLE_LENGTH_DATA_SUFFIX
-TEXT
5.11.0
Relevant if BQSH_FEATURE_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ENABLED is set.
Represents the suffix of the second parameter in the variable-length
character struct. By default, the suffix is -TEXT . If you want
to use a different suffix, set this environment variable to the suffix of
your choice.
SUFFIX_ SUFFIX_STRING
-
5.11.0/5.13.0
(5.13.0 and onwards) Sets the values for the date, timestamp, and null
indicator data types.
Use the following format to set the null indicator:
SUFFIX_ NULL_INDICATOR_NAME ="command --null-value NULL_VALUE --not-null-value NOT_NULL_VALUE "
Use the following format to set the date and timestamp:
SUFFIX_ SUFFIX_NAME ="command --format FORMAT --timezone TIMEZONE "
For more information, see
Support for date and timestamp fields and Support for null indicator fields .
(5.11.0 and onwards) Sets the values for the date and timestamp data types.
You can set this environment variable to any value in the following format:
SUFFIX_SUFFIX_STRING="--bqtype TYPE --format FORMAT --timezone TIMEZONE"
BQSH_FEATURE_CONVERT_UNDERSCORE_IN_FIELDS_NAME
True
5.12.0
Replaces hyphens in the field names in the COPYBOOK to underscores in the corresponding
field names in BigQuery.
BQSH_FEATURE_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL
True
5.12.0
Exports strings with a length of 0 as null to BigQuery.
If you set BQSH_FEATURE_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL to false,
then an empty string remains as an empty string when it is exported to
BigQuery (an empty string won't be set to null).
BQSH_FEATURE_FAIL_ON_INVALID_DATA
False
5.12.1/5.13.0
(5.13.0 and onwards) Lets you enforce stricter error handling, as follows:
Raise an error when parsing date and timestamp types that contain spaces
(or are invalid dates or timestamps).
Raise an error when decoding an invalid byte in a packed decimal type
or a zoned decimal type. This includes values that contain only nulls,
spaces, or high bytes.
(5.12.1 and onwards) Lets you enforce stricter error handling, as follows:
Raise an error when parsing date and timestamp types that contain spaces
(or are invalid dates or timestamps).
Raise an error when decoding an invalid byte in a packed decimal type.
If a value only contains nulls (0x00) or spaces (0x40), it is decoded to
null and does not throw an error for packed decimal, even if this flag is
set to true.
BQSH_FEATURE_EMPTY_VALUES_ARE_NULL
True
5.13.0
Specifies that values containing only nulls (0x00), spaces (0x40), or
high bytes (0xFF) should be decoded as null, and not throw an error for
packed decimal and zoned decimal types. This flag only has an effect if
BQSH_FEATURE_FAIL_ON_INVALID_DATA is set to true. Otherwise, it
does not impact the behavior of the decoders or encoders.
OVERRIDE_GRPC_WINDOW_MB
False
5.13.0
Increases or decreases the window size of the HTTP/2 flow control.
BQSH_FEATURE_TERMINATE_STRINGS_ON_NULL
True
5.14.0
If not set, or if true, the DISPLAY , NATIONAL ,
DBCS , and UTF8 fields interpret null bytes as an
end-of-string indicator and ignore the remaining bytes. If set to false,
null bytes are decoded according to the used character set.
BQSH_FEATURE_CUSTOM_CHARSET
Empty string
5.14.0
Set path to a customized character set . If you want to use multiple character sets, you can
provide the paths to multiple characters sets separated by the semi-colon
delimiter. For example, export BQSH_FEATURE_CUSTOM_CHARSET= path1;path2 .
DISABLE_ANALYTICS
False
5.15.0
Disable Google Analytics.
BQSH_FEATURE_RESPECT_FILLER_ON_EXPORT
False
5.15.1
Populate FILLER fields in a BigQuery export
operation. If you set BQSH_FEATURE_RESPECT_FILLER_ON_EXPORT to
true, Mainframe Connector assigns FILLER values based
on the results of the BigQuery query. For example,
SELECT f1, '|', f2 … from TABLE . The FILLER value
in this case will be set as | .
