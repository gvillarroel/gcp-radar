Pub/Sub configuration
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can configure Mainframe Connector transcoder's Pub/Sub publish formatting by adding the required configuration in a JSON file,
and specifying this file using the --input-parameter pubsub-publish-configuration = DataPath
option with the qsam decode command.
You must define the Pub/Sub publish configuration as specified in section PubsubConfiguration .
This page describes the various Pub/Sub parameters you can configure as input parameters for transcoding.
The PubsubPublishConfiguration object contains all Pub/Sub decoder configuration options.
PubsubPublishConfiguration
The PubsubPublishConfiguration object lets you configure the messages that get sent to Pub/Sub and is used with the
qsam decode command.
JSON representation
{
"attributes_configuration" : object ( AttributesConfiguration ) ,
"ordering_key_configuration" : object ( OrderingKeyConfiguration ) ,
"spillover_configuration" : object ( SpilloverConfiguration ) ,
"batching_settings" : object ( BatchingSettings ) ,
"flow_control_settings" : object ( FlowControlSettings ) ,
"concurrency_control_settings" : object ( ConcurrencyControlSettings ) }
Fields
attributes_configuration
object ( AttributesConfiguration )
Specify the attributes configuration. You can specify the configuration as key-value pairs that can be attached to a Pub/Sub message.
The configuration can then be used for message filtering or to convey additional metadata.
ordering_key_configuration
object ( OrderingKeyConfiguration )
Specify the ordering key configuration. This configuration verifies that messages with the same ordering key are delivered in order.
If you don't set this configuration, message ordering is not guaranteed.
spillover_configuration
object ( SpilloverConfiguration )
Specify the configuration for how spillover messages are sent.
If not set, spillover messages are sent to the input topic with a _spillover suffix.
For example, if the input topic is projects/project_example/topics/topic_example ,
the default spillover topic would be projects/project_example/topics/topic_example_spillover .
batching_settings
object ( BatchingSettings )
Specify the batch settings for publishing messages. By default, batch processing is disabled.
For more information, see Publish with batch settings .
flow_control_settings
object ( FlowControlSettings )
Specify the flow control settings to be used for publishing messages. By default, flow control settings are disabled.
For more information, see Publish messages with flow control settings .
concurrency_control_settings
object ( ConcurrencyControlSettings )
Specify the concurrency and message processing settings for the publisher client.
These settings control the parallelism for publishing messages, acknowledging successful deliveries,
and handling any errors during the publishing process.
For more information, see Concurrency control .
AttributesConfiguration
The AttributesConfiguration message specifies a fixed set of attributes that define how attributes are
sourced for Pub/Sub messages.
JSON representation
{
"attributes" : object ( Attributes ) }
Fields
attributes
object ( Attributes )
A collection of fixed key-value attributes to be attached to the Pub/Sub messages.
OrderingKeyConfiguration
The OrderingKeyConfiguration message specifies a static string as the ordering key that defines how the
ordering key for Pub/Sub messages is determined.
JSON representation
{
"key" : string }
Fields
key
string
The string value to use as the ordering key for the Pub/Sub message.
SpilloverConfiguration
The SpilloverConfiguration message defines how to specify an alternative topic for spillover messages.
You can specify either a full topic name or a suffix to append to the input topic name.
These two options are mutually exclusive; you must choose one.
JSON representation
{
"name" : string ,
"suffix" : string }
Fields
name
string
Specify the full resource name of an alternative topic for spillover messages in the format projects/{project}/topics/{topic} .
suffix
string
Specify a suffix to append to the input topic name for spillover messages.
For example, if the input topic is projects/project_example/topics/my-topic ,
and the suffix is _errors , the spillover topic would be projects/project_example/topics/my-topic_errors .
BatchingSettings
The BatchingSettings message lets you specify the batch settings for publishing messages to Pub/Sub.
You should verify your batch settings are configured to respect the defined Pub/Sub quotas and limits .
To disable batch processing, set message_count_threshold=1 .
JSON representation
{
"delay_threshold" : string ,
"element_count_threshold" : long ,
"request_byte_threshold" : long }
Fields
delay_threshold
string
Specify the delay threshold to use for batch processing. After the amount of time defined by
delay_threshold has elapsed (counting from the first message added), the messages are wrapped up in a batch and sent.
We recommend that you don't set this value too high, otherwise, calls might appear to never complete.
If you prioritize real-time or near real-time processing, you'll want a lower delay threshold (a few tens or hundreds of milliseconds). This verifies messages are sent quickly.
If you're dealing with large-scale batch processing where immediate delivery isn't critical, a higher threshold (a few seconds) might be acceptable to allow for larger, more efficient batches.
For more information on duration format, see
Duration .
If a delay threshold of 0 seconds is provided, it is considered as if a delay threshold was not provided, and the default is used.
The default value is 1 ms.
element_count_threshold
long
Specify the message count threshold to use for batch processing. After the number of messages defined by
message_count_threshold are accumulated, they are wrapped up in a batch and sent,
even if the delay threshold hasn't elapsed yet.
If your messages are consistently small, consider increasing the message count threshold.
The default value is 1.
request_byte_threshold
long
Specify the maximum size in bytes of messages to accumulate before sending a batch to Pub/Sub.
This applies even if neither the delay or message count thresholds have been exceeded yet.
If your messages are consistently small, consider increasing the byte threshold.
The default value is 1 byte.
FlowControlSettings
The FlowControlSettings message lets you specify how the publisher client manages the flow of messages to Pub/Sub.
These settings prevent the client from consuming excessive resources or overwhelming Pub/Sub.
JSON representation
{
"limit_exceeded_behavior" : enum ( LimitExceededBehavior ) ,
"max_outstanding_element_count" : long ,
"max_outstanding_request_bytes" : long }
Fields
limit_exceeded_behavior
enum ( LimitExceededBehavior )
Specify the behavior when flow control limits are exceeded. The default value is BLOCK .
max_outstanding_element_count
long
Specify the maximum number of messages that can be outstanding (sent but not yet acknowledged by Pub/Sub).
If your mainframe has abundant memory and you want to push very high throughput, you can try increasing the count.
max_outstanding_request_bytes
long
Specifies the maximum total size in bytes of outstanding messages.
ConcurrencyControlSettings
The ConcurrencyControlSettings message lets you configure the parallelism of message publishing.
These settings influence how many messages can be sent concurrently.
JSON representation
{
"publishing_threads" : int ,
"result_processing_threads" : int }
Fields
publishing_threads
int
Specify the number of processing threads to publish messages. The value should be equal or less than the number of cores available.
If the number of threads is 0, publishing is handled synchronously.
result_processing_threads
int
Specify the number of threads for processing Pub/Sub message results.
This includes acknowledging successfully sent messages and handling any errors that occur during publishing.
A value of 0 means result processing parallelism is handled synchronously.
The default value is 1.
Attributes
The Attributes message specifies a collection of Attribute key-value pairs that define how the attributes are determined.
JSON representation
{
"attribute" : object ( Attribute ) }
Fields
attribute
object ( Attribute )
Specify a collection of key-value pairs.
Attribute
The Attribute message represents a single key-value pair used as a Pub/Sub message attribute.
JSON representation
{
"key" : string ,
"value" : string }
Fields
key
string
Specify the key of the attribute.
value
string
Specify the value of the attribute.
LimitExceededBehavior
The LimitExceededBehavior enum lets you configure the behavior when flow control limits are exceeded.
Enums
BLOCK
The Pub/Sub publisher will block when limits are exceeded. This prevents publishing further messages until resources become available.
IGNORE
The Pub/Sub publisher will ignore limits and continue publishing when limits are exceeded. This may lead to increased resource consumption.
THROW_EXCEPTION
The Pub/Sub publisher will throw an exception when limits are exceeded, indicating a failure to publish.
