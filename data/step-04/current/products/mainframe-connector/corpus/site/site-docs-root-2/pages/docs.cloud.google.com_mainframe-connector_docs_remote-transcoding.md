Transcode mainframe data remotely on Google Cloud
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Transcoding data locally on a mainframe is a CPU-intensive process that results
in high million instructions per second (MIPS) consumption. To avoid this, you
can use Cloud Run to move and transcode mainframe data remotely on
Google Cloud to optimized row columnar (ORC) format and then move the data to
Cloud Storage. This frees up your mainframe for business critical tasks and
also reduces MIPS consumption.
The following figure describes how you can move your mainframe data to
Google Cloud and transcode it remotely to ORC format using
Cloud Run, and then move the content to BigQuery.
Remotely transcode mainframe data
Before you begin
Deploy Mainframe Connector on Cloud Run .
Create a service account or identify an
existing service account to use with Mainframe Connector. This
service account must have permissions to access Cloud Storage buckets,
BigQuery datasets, and any other Google Cloud resource that you want
to use.
Verify that the service account you created is assigned the Cloud Run Invoker role .
Move mainframe data to Google Cloud and transcode it remotely using Cloud Run
To move your mainframe data to Google Cloud and transcode it remotely using
Cloud Run, you must perform the following tasks:
Read and transcode a dataset on a mainframe, and upload it to Cloud Storage
in ORC format. Transcoding is done during the gsutil cp operation, where a mainframe extended binary
coded decimal interchange code (EBCDIC) dataset is converted to the ORC
format in UTF-8 during the copy to a Cloud Storage bucket.
Load the dataset to a BigQuery table.
(Optional) Execute a SQL query on the BigQuery table.
(Optional) Export data from BigQuery into a binary file in
Cloud Storage.
To perform these tasks, follow these steps:
On your mainframe, create a job to read the dataset on your mainframe and
transcode it to ORC format, as follows. Read the data from the
INFILE dataset , and the
record layout from the COPYBOOK DD .
The input dataset must be a queued sequential access method (QSAM) file with
fixed or variable record length.
Note
Not all Google Cloud commands support remote transcoding. For more
information, see Mainframe Connector API reference .
Variables with the suffix FILLER are ignored during the
import process.
From version 5.12.0 onwards, Mainframe Connector replaces
hyphens ("-") with underscores ("_") in variable names. If you want to
keep hyphens in your variable names, disable this automatic conversion
by setting the database variable BQSH_FEATURE_CONVERT_UNDERSCORE_IN_FIELDS_NAME
to false .
For the complete list of environment variables supported by
Mainframe Connector, see Environment variables .
//STEP01 EXEC BQSH
//INFILE DD DSN=<HLQ>.DATA.FILENAME,DISP=SHR
//COPYBOOK DD DISP=SHR,DSN=<HLQ>.COPYBOOK.FILENAME
//STDIN DD *
gsutil cp --replace gs://mybucket/tablename.orc --remote \
--remoteHost <mainframe-connector-url>.a.run.app \
--remotePort 443
/*
If you want to log the commands executed during this process, you can enable load statistics .
(Optional) Create and submit a BigQuery query job that executes a SQL read from
the QUERY DD file .
Typically the query will be a MERGE or SELECT INTO DML
statement that results in transformation of a BigQuery table. Note
that Mainframe Connector logs in job metrics but doesn't write query
results to a file.
You can query BigQuery in various ways-inline, with a separate
dataset using DD, or with a separate dataset using DSN.
Example JCL
//STEP03 EXEC BQSH
//QUERY DD DSN=<HLQ>.QUERY.FILENAME,DISP=SHR
//STDIN DD *
PROJECT= PROJECT_NAME
LOCATION= LOCATION
bq query --project_id=$PROJECT \
--location=$LOCATION \
--remoteHost <mainframe-connector-url>.a.run.app \
--remotePort 443/*
/*
Additionally, you must set the environment variable BQ_QUERY_REMOTE_EXECUTION=true .
Replace the following:
PROJECT_NAME : The name of the project in which you
want to execute the query.
LOCATION : The location for where the query will be
executed. We recommended that you execute the query in a location close to the
data.
(Optional) Create and submit an export job that executes a SQL read from the
QUERY DD file , and exports
the resulting dataset to Cloud Storage as a binary file.
Example JCL
//STEP04 EXEC BQSH
//OUTFILE DD DSN=<HLQ>.DATA.FILENAME,DISP=SHR
//COPYBOOK DD DISP=SHR,DSN=<HLQ>.COPYBOOK.FILENAME
//QUERY DD DSN=<HLQ>.QUERY.FILENAME,DISP=SHR
//STDIN DD *
PROJECT= PROJECT_NAME
DATASET_ID= DATASET_ID
DESTINATION_TABLE= DESTINATION_TABLE
BUCKET= BUCKET
bq export --project_id=$PROJECT \
--dataset_id=$DATASET_ID \
--destination_table=$DESTINATION_TABLE \
--location="US" \
--bucket=$BUCKET \
--remoteHost <mainframe-connector-url>.a.run.app \
--remotePort 443
/*
Replace the following:
PROJECT_NAME : The name of the project in which you
want to execute the query.
DATASET_ID : The BigQuery dataset ID that
contains the table that you want to export.
DESTINATION_TABLE : The BigQuery table
that you want to export.
BUCKET : The Cloud Storage bucket that will
contain the output binary file.
