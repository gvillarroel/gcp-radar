Repository overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Artifact Registry enables you to store different artifact types,
create multiple repositories in a single project, and associate a specific
regional or multi-regional location with each repository. This page describes
considerations to help you plan the locations and organization of your
repositories.
Consider both internal processes for creating your artifacts and
the usage by consumers of your artifacts when you create your repositories.
Repository formats
Each repository is associated with a specific artifact
format . For example, a Docker repository
stores Docker images. You can create multiple repositories for each format in
the same Google Cloud project.
Repository modes
There are multiple repository modes. Each mode serves a different purpose, so
you cannot change the repository mode after you have created a repository.
Standard repository
Standard repositories are regular Artifact Registry repositories for
your private artifacts. You upload and download artifacts directly with these
repositories and use Artifact Analysis to scan for vulnerabilities
and other metadata.
To create standard repositories, follow the steps in
Create standard repositories .
Remote repository
Remote repositories are read-only repositories that act as proxies to store
artifacts from the following upstream sources:
Standard Artifact Registry repositories.
External sources such as Docker Hub, Maven Central, the Python Package
Index (PyPI), Debian or CentOS.
The first time you request an artifact version, the repository downloads it from
the upstream source and caches a copy of it. The remote repository serves the
cached copy when the same version is requested again.
Remote repositories reduce latency and improve availability for builds and
deployments on Google Cloud. You can also use
Artifact Analysis to scan cached packages for vulnerabilities and
other metadata.
To learn more about remote repositories, read
Remote repository overview . To create remote repositories,
follow the steps in Create remote repositories .
Virtual repository
A read-only repository that acts as a single access point to download,
install, or deploy artifacts of the same format from one or more
upstream repositories . An upstream repository can be a
standard, remote, or virtual repository.
Virtual repositories simplify client configuration for consumers of your
artifacts. You can also mitigate
dependency confusion attacks by configuring your upstream
policy to prioritize repositories with your private artifacts over remote
repositories that cache public artifacts.
To learn more about virtual repositories, read
Virtual repository overview . To create virtual repositories,
follow the steps in Create virtual repositories .
Repository usage example
The following diagram shows one of many possible ways you can use repositories
in different modes together. The diagram shows a workflow across two
Google Cloud projects. In a development project, developers build a Java
application. In a separate runtime project, another build creates a container
image with the application for deployment to Google Kubernetes Engine.
In the development project, a Java development team uses
Cloud Build to build a Java application.
The build can request public Java dependencies using the virtual
repository. The virtual repository serves the dependencies from the remote
repository, which is a caching proxy for Maven Central.
Cloud Build uploads the package to the standard Maven repository
in the component project.
In the runtime project, Cloud Build containerizes the Java
application.
The build uses the Maven virtual repository to download the application. The
virtual repository serves the package from the standard repository in
the development project. The build can also download public Java
dependencies from the same virtual repository.
In the runtime project, Cloud Build uploads the built container
image to a standard Docker repository.
GKE pulls images from the Docker virtual repository.
The upstream standard Docker repository provides private images, such as
the containerized Java application.
The upstream remote repository provides images that GKE
requests from Docker Hub.
In this example, all repositories, builds, and GKE clusters are
in the same region. Using the same location for Google Cloud services
has benefits which are described in Repository location .
Repository location
You can create one or more repositories in a supported
region or multi-region . A good repository location balances
latency, availability, and bandwidth costs for data consumers.
Your organization might also have specific compliance requirements.
Location considerations
This section describes why you might want to create a repository in the same
region as other Google Cloud services.
You can reduce latency and network egress costs by creating repositories
in the same region where you run GKE, Cloud Run,
Cloud Build, and other Google Cloud services that interact with
the repository. There is no charge for egress from
Artifact Registry to other Google Cloud services in the same
region.
Although there is no charge for egress from a multi-region to a
Google Cloud service in a corresponding region, this pricing only
applies to a limited set of regions.
For the us multi-region, egress to a region in the United States such as
us-central is not charged, to any region in Canada or South America is
charged.
For the asia multi-region, egress to regions in Asia such as
asia-northeast1 are not charged, but egress to regions in Australia are
charged.
You can only use image streaming in GKE
and Managed Service for Apache Spark
if your container images are stored in Artifact Registry
repositories in the same region as your workloads or a multi-region that
corresponds to the region with your workloads. Image streaming can reduce
workload initialization time significantly when you are using larger container
images since workloads can start before the entire image is downloaded.
Consider the location of consumers outside of Google Cloud. For
example, if you developers team in Australia need to download artifacts
from Artifact Registry to their local workstations, a repository
in an Australian region will reduce latency and incur lower egress charges
than a repository located on another continent.
Restricting repository locations
If you need to comply with regulations or policies that require you to store
data in specific regions, you can include a
resource locations constraint in your Google Cloud
organization policy that only allows repository creation in compliant regions.
Artifact Registry only enforces the constraint after you include it
in your organization policy. If you have existing repositories in
non-compliant locations, you must move your artifacts to a repository in a
compliant location yourself and then delete the non-compliant repository.
Cleanup policies
An Artifact Registry cleanup policy defines criteria for automatically deleting
artifact versions that you no longer need or keeping artifacts that you want
to store indefinitely.
Cleanup policies are useful if you store many versions of your artifacts, but
only need to keep specific versions that you release to production. You
can define delete policies with criteria for deleting artifacts and
keep policies with criteria for retaining artifacts.
If an artifact version matches criteria in both a delete policy and a keep
policy, Artifact Registry applies the keep policy.
Use delete policies
Delete policies delete artifacts matching the following required criteria:
Tag state : indicates if the policy should check for tagged artifacts or
untagged artifacts. Artifacts are tagged when pushing or pulling an image to
or from a repository. For more on Docker tags, see Container concepts .
Any tag state : ignores tag state and applies to both tagged and
untagged artifacts.
Tagged : only applies to tagged artifacts.
Untagged : only applies to untagged artifacts.
Formats that don't support tags are treated as untagged . Tagged artifacts
in repositories with immutable tags enabled cannot be deleted.
For more
information on tag state as it applies to cleanup policies, see the
TagState reference .
You can use any of the following settings to configure your delete policy:
Tag prefixes : is a comma-separated list of
tag prefixes. For example, the prefixes test , and staging would match
images with tags testenv and staging-1.5 . tagState must be set to
TAGGED to use tag prefixes.
Version prefixes : - is a comma-separated list of artifact version
prefixes. For example v1 , v2 would match versions v1.5 ,
v2.0alpha , and v10.2 .
Package prefixes : is a list of artifact name prefixes. You can enter
multiple prefixes by pressing Enter or , between the prefixes.
For example red, blue would create two prefixes, red and blue and
would match artifact names red-team , redis ,
and bluebird .
Older than : is a minimum time since an
artifact version was uploaded to the repository, specified as a duration.
For example, 30d is 30 days. You can specify durations of seconds,
minutes, hours, or days by appending s , m , h , or d respectively.
Newer than : is a maximum time since an
artifact version was uploaded to the repository, specified as a duration.
For example, 30d is 30 days.
Use keep policies
Keep policies keep artifacts matching the same conditions as delete policies, or
a set number of most recent versions.
Caution: if you define Package prefixes in a Keep most recent versions
keep policy, only packages matching the package prefixes you define are kept.
For example, given a repository containing the following artifacts:
IMAGE: us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/release-xyz-v1
DIGEST: sha256:1b0a26bd07a3d17473d8d8468bea84015e27f87124b2831234581bce13f61370

CREATE_TIME: 2023 -06-19T18:59:09
UPDATE_TIME: 2023 -06-19T18:59:09
If your Keep most recent versions policy is set to keep 3 versions of
packages matching the Package prefixes : {release-xyz} , only
release-xyz-v1 , and release-xyz-v2 are kept.
Deletions triggered by delete policies count against your Artifact Registry
per project delete request quota .
To create and apply cleanup policies to your repository, see
Configure cleanup policies .
gcr.io domain support
Artifact Registry supports hosting of images on the gcr.io domain. If you are
transitioning from Container Registry to Artifact Registry, you can set up
gcr.io repositories Artifact Registry to minimize changes to your existing
automation and workflows. These repositories provide:
Redirection of requests to the gcr.io domain.
Creation of gcr.io repositories when the first image is pushed to a gcr.io
hostname for compatibility with Container Registry behavior.
For more information, see
Transition to repositories with gcr.io domain support
Project structure
Your resource hierarchy is the way that you organize your resources
across Google Cloud projects. The structure that you choose depends on
factors such as data governance requirements, trust boundaries, and team
structure.
There are two general approaches for setting up your repositories in
multi-project organizations.
Centralize repositories
Create all repositories in a single project and then grant access to
principals from other projects at the repository level. This approach can
be more effective when a single person or team handles repository
administration and repository access across your organization.
It can also simplify setup of virtual repositories since you only need to
enable and manage a single instance of Artifact Registry.
Project-specific repositories
Create repositories in projects that store and download artifacts. This
approach might be required when you have data governance policies or
trust boundaries that require more project-level separation and control of
resources.
Access control
Repositories are only accessible with appropriate permissions unless you
configure the repository for public access . You can grant
permissions at the project or repository level.
Some Google Cloud services use default service accounts
with default permissions to repositories in the same Google Cloud project.
However, these default might not be suitable for your software
development process or might not comply with security or policy requirements
in your organization. Your repository administrator must explicitly grant
these services access to repositories if:
Artifact Registry is in a different project than the service that is
interacting with it.
You are using custom IAM roles with the default service
accounts instead of the predefined role.
You are not using the default service account for the Google Cloud
service.
You are setting up virtual repositories. You must explicitly grant
the Artifact Registry service account access to upstream
repositories.
For other principals that require access to repositories, your repository
administrator must grant access. Following the security principle of least
privilege, grant the minimum required permissions. For example:
You deploy container images in Artifact Registry to GKE
clusters in several different projects. The service account for nodes
in these clusters only require read access to repositories.
You have a development repository for applications that are in development and
production repository for applications that are released.
Developers require read and write access to the development repository and
read-only access to the production repository.
You have a demo repository with sample applications. Your sales team only
requires read-only access to download the demos.
Restrict artifact downloads
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
You can restrict artifact downloads with download rules .
Download rules let you allow or deny artifact downloads from your repositories
and packages. You can also set conditions so the rule applies to specific tags
or versions.
For details on how downloads rules work, see the Restrict artifact downloads
section of the Control access and protect artifacts overview.
Data encryption
By default, Google Cloud automatically encrypts data when it is at
rest using Google-owned and Google-managed encryption keys.
If you have specific compliance or regulatory
requirements related to the keys that protect your data, you can create
repositories encrypted with customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK).
Artifact Registry also supports organization policy constraints
that can require CMEK to protect resources.
Labels and tags
Labels provide a way to organize resources specific to a Google Cloud
service. In Artifact Registry, you can add labels to repositories so that
you can group them together or filter repository lists by label. For example,
you can use labels to group repositories by development stage or by team for
automation or billing purposes. For more information about creating and using
repository labels, see Labelling repositories .
You can also apply tags to repositories. While labels are primarily for
organizing and filtering service-specific resources, tags are for programmatic
control of policies across a Google Cloud organization. For more
information, see Tagging repositories .
