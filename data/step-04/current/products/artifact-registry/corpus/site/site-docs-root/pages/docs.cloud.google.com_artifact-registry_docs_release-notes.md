Issue
Images copied to Artifact Registry from Container Registry with the automatic migration
tool are failing to propagate their upload time to Artifact Registry, and instead have their upload time value set to zero, resulting in an upload time of early 1970. If you have cleanup policies that delete images based on upload time, this might mean all your copied images are deleted. We are actively working on a fix for this issue.
