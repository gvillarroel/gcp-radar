Configure authentication to Artifact Registry for Docker
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to configure Docker to authenticate to Artifact Registry
Docker repositories.
You don't need to configure authentication for Cloud Build or Google Cloud
runtime environments such as Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Run, but you should
verify that the required permissions
are configured.
Before you begin
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
(Optional) Configure defaults for gcloud CLI commands .
Verify that the account you are using for authentication has
permission to access Artifact Registry.
We recommend using a service account rather
than a user account.
Install Docker
if it is not already installed. Docker is included in Cloud Shell.
Docker requires privileged access to interact with registries.
On Linux or Windows, add the user that you use to run Docker commands to
the Docker security group. This step is not required on macOS since
Docker Desktop
runs on a virtual machine as the root user.
Linux
The Docker security group is called docker .
To add your username, run the following command:
sudo usermod -a -G docker ${USER}
Windows
The Docker security group is called docker-users .
To add a user from the Administrator command prompt, run the following
command:
net localgroup docker-users DOMAIN \ USERNAME /add
Where:
DOMAIN is your Windows domain.
USERNAME is your username.
Log out and log back in for group membership changes to take effect.
If you are using a virtual machine, you may need to restart the virtual
machine for membership changes to take effect.
Note: The Docker security group has access
that is equivalent to the root or
Administrator user. Only add trusted users who require access to Docker.
For details about security impacts, see
Docker daemon security .
Choosing an authentication method
The following authentication methods are available:
gcloud CLI credential helper
Configure your Artifact Registry credentials for use with
Docker directly in gcloud CLI. This is the simplest authentication method, but
can be slower than the standalone credential helper.
Standalone Docker credential helper
This option is primarily for configuring your credentials for use with Docker
in the absence of Google Cloud CLI. It is significantly faster than the gcloud CLI
credential helper and uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) to automatically find
credentials in your environment.
Access token
You can generate a short-lived access token for a service account and then
use the token for password authentication. Since the token only valid for 60
minutes, it is a safer option than a service account key.
Service account key
A user-managed key-pair that you can use as a credential for a
service account. Because the credential is long-lived, it is the least secure
option of all the available authentication methods.
When possible, use an access token
or a credential helper to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your
container images. If you must use a service account key, ensure that
you follow best practices for managing credentials .
Warning: The Docker credential helper is only supported for Docker 18.03
or later. A bug in earlier versions of the Docker client slows down
docker build dramatically when credential helpers are configured.
Authentication settings in the Docker configuration file
Docker saves authentication settings in the configuration file
config.json .
Linux: ~/.docker/config.json
Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.docker\config.json
There are separate sections in the file for different authentication methods:
credHelpers
If you use the Docker credential helper for authentication
Artifact Registry stores the credential helper settings in the
credHelpers section of the file.
auths
If you use Docker to sign in with a token or service account key as your
password, Docker stores a base64-encoded version of your credentials in the
auths section of the file.
credStore
If you configured a
credential store
to manage your credentials, the settings for the credential store are in
the credStore section of the file.
When Docker connects to a registry, it checks first for a credential helper
that is associated with the host. So if your config.json includes
Artifact Registry settings in both the credHelpers and auths sections,
the settings in the auths section are ignored.
gcloud CLI credential helper
The gcloud CLI credential helper provides secure, short-lived access to your
project resources. It configures Docker to authenticate to
Artifact Registry hosts in any environment where the
Google Cloud CLI is installed.
Cloud Shell
includes the Google Cloud CLI and a current version of Docker.
The gcloud CLI credential helper is the simplest authentication method to set up.
It configures Docker with the credentials of the active user or service account
in your gcloud CLI session. Since this credential helper depends on
gcloud CLI, it can be significantly slower than the
standalone credential helper . For automated builds with
third-party tools or Docker clients with a large number of configured registry
hosts, use the standalone credential helper instead.
To authenticate to Artifact Registry:
Sign in to gcloud CLI as the user that will run Docker commands.
To configure authentication with user credentials, run the following
command:
gcloud auth login
To configure authentication with service account credentials, run the
following command:
gcloud auth activate-service-account ACCOUNT --key-file = KEY-FILE
Where
ACCOUNT is the service account that you want to use with
Artifact Registry in the format
USERNAME @ PROJECT-ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com .
If you want to use an existing account, you can view a list of service
accounts on the
Service Accounts
page of Google Cloud console or with the command
gcloud iam service-accounts list
KEY-FILE is the service account key file. See the
Identity and Access Management (IAM) documentation
for information about creating a key.
Note:
Service account keys are a security risk if not managed correctly. You should
choose a more secure alternative to service account keys
whenever possible. If you must authenticate with a service account key, you are responsible for the
security of the private key and for other operations described by
Best practices for managing service account keys .
If you are prevented from creating a service account key, service account key creation might
be disabled for your organization. For more information, see
Managing secure-by-default organization resources .
If you acquired the service account key from an external source, you must validate it before use.
For more information, see
Security requirements for externally sourced credentials .
Run the following command:
gcloud auth configure-docker HOSTNAME-LIST
Where HOSTNAME-LIST is a comma-separated list of repository
hostnames to add to the credential helper configuration.
For example, to add the regions us-west1 and asia-northeast1 , run
the command:
gcloud auth configure-docker us-west1-docker.pkg.dev,asia-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev
The specified hostnames are added to the credential helper configuration.
You can add other hostnames to the configuration later by running the
command again.
To view a list of supported repository locations, run the command:
gcloud artifacts locations list
The command displays the credHelpers section of your current Docker
configuration and the updated configuration after adding the specified
hostnames.
To accept the configuration changes, enter y .
Your credentials are saved in your user home directory.
Linux: $HOME/.docker/config.json
Windows: %USERPROFILE%/.docker/config.json
Docker requires credential helpers to be in the system PATH . Ensure that
the gcloud command is in the system PATH .
Note: If you normally run Docker commands on Linux with sudo , Docker looks
for Artifact Registry credentials in /root/.docker/config.json instead
of $HOME/.docker/config.json . If you want to use sudo with docker
commands instead of using the Docker security group, configure credentials with
sudo gcloud auth configure-docker instead.
Standalone credential helper
The standalone Docker credential helper configures Docker to authenticate
to Artifact Registry on a system where the gcloud CLI is not available.
It is significantly faster than the gcloud CLI credential helper
and uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) to automatically find
credentials in the your environment. For operations other than pushing and
pulling images, such as tagging or listing images. We recommend using this
authentication method for automated builds with third-party tools or Docker
clients with a large number of configured registry hosts.
The standalone Docker credential helper fetches your Artifact Registry
credentials and writes them to the Docker configuration file. This way, you
can use the Docker command-line tool, docker , to interact directly with
Artifact Registry.
To use the Docker credential helper:
Log on to the machine as the user who will run Docker commands.
Download the standalone Docker credential helper from
GitHub .
You can optionally use the curl command-line utility. For example:
VERSION = 2 .1.29
OS = linux # or "darwin" for OSX, "windows" for Windows.
ARCH = amd64 # or "386" for 32-bit OSs
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/docker-credential-gcr/releases/download/v ${ VERSION } /docker-credential-gcr_ ${ OS } _ ${ ARCH } - ${ VERSION } .tar.gz" \
| tar xz docker-credential-gcr \
&& chmod +x docker-credential-gcr && sudo mv docker-credential-gcr /usr/bin/
Configure Docker to use your Artifact Registry credentials when
interacting with Artifact Registry (you are only required to do this
once):
docker-credential-gcr configure-docker --registries = HOSTNAME-LIST
Where HOSTNAME-LIST is a comma-separated list of repository
hostnames to add to the credential helper configuration.
For example, to add the regions us-west1 and asia-northeast1 , run
the command:
docker-credential-gcr configure-docker --registries=us-west1-docker.pkg.dev,asia-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev
The specified hostnames are added to the credential helper configuration.
You can add other hostnames to the configuration later by running the
command again.
To view a list of supported repository locations, run the command:
gcloud artifacts locations list
See the
standalone Docker credential helper documentation
on GitHub for more information.
Note: If you normally run Docker commands on Linux with sudo , Docker looks
for Artifact Registry credentials in /root/.docker/config.json instead
of $HOME/.docker/config.json . If you want to use sudo with docker
commands instead of using the Docker security group, configure credentials with
sudo docker-credential-gcr configure-docker instead.
Your credentials are saved in your user home directory.
Linux: $HOME/.docker/config.json
Windows: %USERPROFILE%/.docker/config.json
Docker requires credential helpers to be in the system PATH . Ensure that
the docker-credential-gcr command is in the system PATH .
To verify that the credential helper can successfully retrieve your
credentials, run the following command:
echo "https:// HOSTNAME " | docker-credential-gcr get
Replace HOSTNAME with a hostname that you added to the
configuration. For example:
echo "https://us-west1-docker.pkg.dev" | docker-credential-gcr get
If the command is successful, the returned JSON output includes a token in
the Secret field. For example:
{"ServerURL":"https://us-west1-docker.pkg.dev","Username":"_dcgcr_2_0_0_token","Secret":"ya29..."}
Docker is now configured to authenticate with Artifact Registry. To push
and pull images, make sure that permissions
are correctly configured.
Access token
You can generate a short-lived OAuth access token to authenticate with
Artifact Registry. Since the token is valid for 60 minutes,
you should request it less than an hour before you use it to connect with
Artifact Registry.
To use an access token with service account credentials:
Create a service account to act on behalf of your application,
or choose an existing service account that you use for automation.
Grant the specific Artifact Registry role
to the service account to provide repository access.
Generate an access token for the service account and authenticate:
You must have the permissions in the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) to
impersonate a service account,
to obtain a token for it, and then authenticate as the service account.
Run the following command, replacing ACCOUNT with your
service account email address and LOCATION with the
regional or multi-regional location of
the repository.
Linux
gcloud auth print-access-token \
--impersonate-service-account ACCOUNT | docker login \
-u oauth2accesstoken \
--password-stdin https:// LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev
Windows
gcloud auth print-access-token --impersonate-service-account ACCOUNT | docker login -u oauth2accesstoken --password-stdin https:// LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev
Docker is now authenticated with Artifact Registry.
Service account key
Note: When possible, use an access token or credential helper to
reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your artifacts.
Service account keys are a security risk if not managed correctly. You should
choose a more secure alternative to service account keys
whenever possible. If you must authenticate with a service account key, you are responsible for the
security of the private key and for other operations described by
Best practices for managing service account keys .
If you are prevented from creating a service account key, service account key creation might
be disabled for your organization. For more information, see
Managing secure-by-default organization resources .
If you acquired the service account key from an external source, you must validate it before use.
For more information, see
Security requirements for externally sourced credentials .
Anyone who has access to a valid private key for a service account will be able
to access resources through the service account. Note that the lifecycle of the
key's access to the service account (and thus, the data the service account has
access to) is independent of the lifecycle of the user who has downloaded the
key.
Use the following guidelines to limit access to your repositories:
Create dedicated service accounts that are only used to interact with
repositories.
Grant the specific
Artifact Registry role
for the access required by the service account. For example, a service account
that only downloads artifacts only requires the Artifact Registry Reader
role.
Configure the permissions for your dedicated service accounts on each
repository rather than at the project level. You can then specify access
based on the repository context. For example, a service account
for development builds might have the Artifact Registry Reader role for
a production repository and the Artifact Registry Writer role for a
staging repository.
Follow best practices for managing credentials .
To create a new service account and a service account key for use with
Artifact Registry repositories only:
Create a service
account to act on behalf of your application, or choose an existing service
account that you use for automation.
You will need the location of the service account key file to set up
authentication with Artifact Registry. For existing accounts,
you can view keys and create new keys on the Service Accounts page.
Go to the Service Accounts page
Note:
Service account keys are a security risk if not managed correctly. You should
choose a more secure alternative to service account keys
whenever possible. If you must authenticate with a service account key, you are responsible for the
security of the private key and for other operations described by
Best practices for managing service account keys .
If you are prevented from creating a service account key, service account key creation might
be disabled for your organization. For more information, see
Managing secure-by-default organization resources .
If you acquired the service account key from an external source, you must validate it before use.
For more information, see
Security requirements for externally sourced credentials .
You can optionally base64-encode all the contents of the key file.
Linux
base64 FILE-NAME > NEW-FILE-NAME
macOS
base64 -i FILE-NAME -o NEW-FILE-NAME
Windows
Base64.exe -e FILE-NAME > NEW-FILE-NAME
Where FILE-NAME is the original key filename and
NEW-FILE-NAME is your base64-encoded key file.
Verify that permissions are correctly
configured for the service account. If you are using the Compute Engine
service account, you must correctly configure both permissions and
access scopes.
Use the service account key to configure integration with Docker:
Run the following command:
Linux / macOS
cat KEY-FILE | docker login -u KEY-TYPE --password-stdin \
https:// LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev
Windows
Get-Content KEY-FILE |
docker login -u KEY-TYPE --password-stdin https:// LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev
Replace the following:
KEY-TYPE is one of the following:
_json_key if you are using the service account key in JSON format as it was provided when you created the file.
_json_key_base64 if you base64-encoded the all contents of the file.
KEY-FILE is the name of the service account key file in JSON format.
LOCATION is the regional or multi-regional location
of the repository where the image is stored.
Docker is now authenticated with Artifact Registry.
