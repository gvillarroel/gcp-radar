This page describes how to configure Cloud Build to store built
artifacts in an Artifact Registry repository.
Before you begin
If the target repository does not exist in Artifact Registry,
create a new repository .
If Cloud Build and your repository are in different projects
or if you are using a user-specified service account to run
builds, grant the Artifact Registry Writer role
to the build service account in the project with the repositories.
The default Cloud Build service account has access to perform
the following actions with a repository in the same Google Cloud project:
Upload and download artifacts
Create gcr.io repositories in Artifact Registry
Configure a Docker build
After you have granted permissions to the target repository, you are ready to
configure your build.
To configure your build:
In your build config file, add the step to build and tag the image.
steps :
- name : 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
args : [ 'build' , '-t' , '${_LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY}/${_IMAGE}' , '.' ]
images :
- '${_LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY}/${_IMAGE}'
This snippet uses Cloud Build substitutions. This approach is useful if
you want to use the same build config file to push images to repositories
for different environments, such as testing, staging, or production.
${_LOCATION} , ${_REPOSITORY} , and ${_IMAGE} are
user-defined substitution for the repository
location, repository name, and image. You specify the values for these
variables at build time.
$PROJECT_ID is a default substitution
that Cloud Build resolves with the Google Cloud project ID
for the build.
If you run the gcloud builds submit command, Cloud Build
uses the active project ID in the gcloud session.
If you use a build trigger, Cloud Build uses the ID of the
project where Cloud Build is running.
Alternatively, you can use a user-defined substitution instead of
$PROJECT_ID so that you can specify a project ID at build time.
When you are ready to run the build, specify values for the user-defined
substitutions. For example, this command substitutes:
us-east1 for the repository location
my-repo for the repository name
my-image for the image name
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml \
--substitutions=_LOCATION="us-east1",_REPOSITORY="my-repo",_IMAGE="my-image" .
Configure a Go build
After you have granted permissions to the target repository, you are ready to
configure your build. The following instructions describe configuring your build
to upload a Go module to a Go repository.
To configure your build:
To upload a Go module to your Go repository in your build, add the following
steps to your build config file:
steps :
- name : gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud
args :
- 'artifacts'
- 'go'
- 'upload'
- '--project=$PROJECT_ID'
- '--location=${_LOCATION}'
- '--repository=${_REPOSITORY}'
- '--module-path=${_MODULE_PATH}'
- '--version=$TAG_NAME'
The build config file includes Cloud Build
substitutions . This approach is useful if you want to
use the same build config file to upload packages to repositories for
different environments, such as testing, staging, or production.
${_LOCATION} , ${_REPOSITORY} , and ${_MODULE_PATH} are user-defined
substitutions for the repository location, repository name, and module
path. You specify the values for these variables at build time.
$PROJECT_ID and $TAG_NAME are
default substitutions that Cloud Build
replaces with the following:
$PROJECT_ID is replaced with the Google Cloud project ID
for the build.
If you run the gcloud builds submit command, Cloud Build
uses the active project ID in the gcloud session.
If you use a build trigger, Cloud Build uses the ID of the
project where Cloud Build is running.
Alternatively, you can use a user-defined substitution instead of
$PROJECT_ID so that you can specify a project ID at build time.
$TAG_NAME is replaced with the name of your tag to support the Go
convention of using Git tags as version numbers.
To install the package from the Go repository, add the following steps to
your build config file to:
Add a regional Artifact Registry endpoint in your repository
location to the .netrc file.
Run the credential helper tool to refresh OAuth tokens.
Run the go run command. You can also change this to go build to
compile the module, go test to run tests, or go mod tidy to download
the dependencies.
For the go command step, the GOPROXY is set to the
Artifact Registry repository that hosts private dependencies. You can
add the public proxy to the comma-separated GOPROXY list if the module
has public dependencies.
steps :
- name : golang
entrypoint : go
args : [ 'run' , 'github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/artifact-registry-go-tools/cmd/auth@v0.1.0' , 'add-locations' , '--locations=${_LOCATION}' ]
env :
# Set GOPROXY to the public proxy to pull the credential helper tool
- 'GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org'
- name : golang
entrypoint : go
args : [ 'run' , 'github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/artifact-registry-go-tools/cmd/auth@v0.1.0' , 'refresh' ]
env :
# Set GOPROXY to the public proxy to pull the credential helper tool
- 'GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org'
- name : golang
entrypoint : go
args : [ 'run' , '.' ]
env :
- 'GOPROXY=https://${_LOCATION}-go.pkg.dev/${_PROJECT_ID}/${_REPOSITORY}'
options :
env :
# Disable GO sumdb checks for private modules.
- 'GONOSUMDB=${_MODULE_PATH}'
When you are ready to run the build, specify values for the user-defined
substitutions. For example, this command substitutes:
us-east1 for the repository location
my-project for the project ID
my-repo for the repository name
example.com/greetings for the module path
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml \
--substitutions=_LOCATION="us-east1",_PROJECT_ID="my-project",_REPOSITORY="my-repo",_MODULE_PATH="example.com/greetings" .
Configure a Java build
After you have granted permissions to the target repository, you are ready to
configure your build. The following instructions describe configuring your build
to upload a Java package to a Maven repository.
To configure your build:
Set up authentication for Maven. Ensure
that you specify the correct target project and repository in your pom.xml
file.
In your Cloud Build build config file, add the step to upload
the package with Maven:
steps :
- name : gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn
args : [ 'deploy' ]
When your build config file is ready, start your build with the following
command:
gcloud builds submit
Configure a Node.js build
After you have granted permissions to the target repository, you are ready to
configure your build. The following instructions describe configuring your build
to upload a Node.js package to an npm repository.
To configure your build:
Add your Artifact Registry repository to the .npmrc file in your Node.js
project. The file is located in the directory with your package.json file.
@ SCOPE :registry=https:// LOCATION -npm.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY
// LOCATION -npm.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /:always-auth=true
SCOPE-NAME is the name of the npm scope
to associate with the repository. Using scopes ensures that you always
publish and install packages from the correct repository.
PROJECT_ID is your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION is the regional or multi-regional location of the repository.
REPOSITORY is the name of the repository.
Add a script to the package.json file in your project that refreshes
the access token for authentication with the repository.
"scripts" : {
"artifactregistry-login" : "npx google-artifactregistry-auth"
}
In your build config file, add the step to upload the package to the
repository.
steps :
- name : gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm
args : [ 'run' , 'artifactregistry-login' ]
- name : gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm
args : [ 'publish' , '${_PACKAGE}' ]
${_PACKAGE} is a Cloud Build
substitution that represents your Node.js project
directory. You can specify the directory when you run the command to run the
build.
For example, this command uploads the package from a directory named src :
gcloud builds submit --config = cloudbuild.yaml \
--substitutions = _PACKAGE = "src" .
Configure a Python build
After you have granted permissions to the target repository, you are ready to
configure your build. The following instructions describe configuring your build
to upload a Python package to a Python repository and install the package using
pip.
To build and containerize a Python application and then push it to a
Docker repository, see Building Python applications in the
Cloud Build documentation.
To configure your build:
In the directory with your Cloud Build build config file, create a
file named requirements.txt with the following dependencies:
twine
keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth
Twine is for
uploading packages to Artifact Registry.
keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth
is the Artifact Registry key ring backend that handles
authentication with Artifact Registry for pip and Twine.
To upload a Python package to your Python repository in your build, add the
following steps to your build config file:
steps :
- name : python
entrypoint : pip
args : [ "install" , "-r" , "requirements.txt" , "--user" ]
- name : python
entrypoint : python
args :
- '-m'
- 'twine'
- 'upload'
- '--repository-url'
- 'https://${_LOCATION}-python.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY}/'
- 'dist/*'
In this snippet, the first step installs Twine and the Artifact Registry
key ring backend. The second step uploads your built Python files in the
dist subdirectory. Adjust the paths to requirements.txt and your
built Python files if they don't match the snippet.
The repository path includes Cloud Build
substitutions . This approach is useful if you want to
use the same build config file to upload packages to repositories for
different environments, such as testing, staging, or production.
${_LOCATION} and ${_REPOSITORY} are user-defined substitutions for the
repository location, repository name, and package name. You specify the
values for these variables at build time.
$PROJECT_ID is a default substitution
that Cloud Build resolves with the Google Cloud project ID
for the build.
If you run the gcloud builds submit command, Cloud Build
uses the active project ID in the gcloud session.
If you use a build trigger, Cloud Build uses the ID of the
project where Cloud Build is running.
Alternatively, you can use a user-defined substitution instead of
$PROJECT_ID so that you can specify a project ID at build time.
To install the package from the Python repository, add a step to your build
config file that runs the pip install command.
steps :
- name : python
entrypoint : pip
args :
- 'install'
- '--index-url'
- 'https://${_LOCATION}-python.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY}/simple/'
- '${_PACKAGE}'
- '--verbose'
This snippet includes an additional ${_PACKAGE} substitution for the
package name.
Note: Starting with pip 21.2, use the --verbose or -v flag up to three
times for additional debugging output. For example to get the next level of
debugging detail, use --verbose --verbose or -vv .
When you are ready to run the build, specify values for the user-defined
substitutions. For example, this command substitutes:
us-east1 for the repository location
my-repo for the repository name
my-package for the package name
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml \
--substitutions=_LOCATION="us-east1",_REPOSITORY="my-repo",_PACKAGE="my-package" .
Store artifacts in a private registry using self-signed certificates
If you have a private certificate authority and need to store artifacts
in a private registry, then you can set up your build config file to use
self-signed certificates. To do so, add a build step that pushes
your certificate to the host system so that the certificate is available for
subsequent build steps. For example:
- name : gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
args :
- run
- --rm
- --volume=/etc/docker/certs.d/:/etc/docker/certs.d/
- --volume=certificates:/certificates
- ubuntu
- bash
- -c
- |
cp /certificates/ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/quay.apps.cloud.inter
volumes :
- name : certificates
path : /certificates
