Configuring Pub/Sub notifications
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can receive notifications from Pub/Sub for the
changes to a Docker repository. Notifications apply to any container image
stored in the repository, including Helm 3 charts
packaged in OCI format.
Pub/Sub publishes messages about your repositories to named
resources called topics . Applications that subscribe to Pub/Sub
topics receive these messages and receive notifications when a repository's
state changes.
Artifact Registry publishes messages for the following changes:
Image uploads
New tags added to images
Image deletion
Additionally, you can configure roles and permissions for publishing or
subscribing to notifications.
For information about configuring Artifact Analysis notifications for
activity such as new vulnerability scan results, see the
Artifact Analysis documentation .
Overview
Artifact Registry publishes messages about changes to repositories in a
topic named gcr .
To receive notifications, you must:
Create a topic named gcr in the project with Artifact Registry.
Create a subscription to the topic.
Set up your subscriber application to receive
messages about repository changes.
If appropriate, configure permissions to control access
to your topic and subscription.
Creating the Artifact Registry topic
To create the gcr topic with Google-owned and Google-managed encryption keys:
Console
Go to the Pub/Sub topics page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Pub/Sub topics page
Click Create Topic .
Enter the topic ID gcr .
Click Create Topic .
gcloud
Run the following command:
gcloud pubsub topics create gcr --project = PROJECT-ID
Replace PROJECT-ID with your Google Cloud
project ID . If you omit the --project flag, the command
uses the current project.
Note: If this command returns a "Resource already exists in the project"
error, the topic gcr already exists in the project.
To learn more about the gcloud pubsub topics command, see the
topics documentation .
To create the gcr topic with CMEK encryption, see the Pub/Sub
instructions for encrypting topics .
After you have have created the gcr topic or verified that it exists, you can
create a subscription to the topic.
Creating a subscription
After you have created a topic for repository changes, you can
configure a subscription to it that uses either push delivery
or pull delivery . We recommend using pull delivery since
CI/CD systems can generate numerous changes to stored artifacts, and pull
delivery is more effective for a large volume of messages.
To create a subscription with pull delivery:
Console
Go to the Pub/Sub topics page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Pub/Sub topics page
Click your project's topic.
Click Create Subscription .
Enter a subscription name:
projects/ PROJECT /subscriptions/[SUBSCRIPTION-NAME]
Leave Delivery Type set to Pull .
Click Create .
gcloud
Run the following command:
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create SUBSCRIPTION-NAME --topic = gcr
Replace SUBSCRIPTION-NAME with a name for the subscription
Note: Use the optional flag --ack-deadline to configure how many seconds
the system will wait for acknowledgement from the subscriber before
re-attempting delivery. Without this flag, the default deadline is 10
seconds.
To learn more about the gcloud pubsub subscriptions command, see the
subscriptions documentation .
You now have a subscription to the gcr topic. The next step is
configuring permissions for the identities that trigger changes
in repositories.
Configuring your subscriber application
After you have created a topic and a subscription
to that topic, you can set up your subscriber application, the application
that receive messages about changes to repositories. Subscriber applications
fulfill tasks like event notifications, system logging,
and communication between applications.
When a repository user pushes or deletes an image, the following steps occur:
The Artifact Registry service account publishes the change to your gcr
topic. The service account is service- PROJECT-NUMBER @gcp-sa-artifactregistry.iam.gserviceaccount.com ,
where PROJECT-NUMBER is your Google Cloud project number . The
Artifact Registry service account has the pubsub.topics.publish
permission by default so that it can publish changes to your topic.
If an administrator has revoked the pubsub.topics.publish permissions for
the Artifact Registry service account, Artifact Registry attempts to publish
the message as the repository user. In this situation, the repository user's
account must have the pubsub.topics.publish permission to successfully
publish the message.
Pub/Sub forwards the message from the topic to your subscription.
When your subscriber application makes a request for messages, it pulls
the new message from the subscription.
The identity that pulls messages on behalf of the subscriber must have
permissions to access the subscription. You can use the
Pub/Sub Subscriber role
to grant this permission.
To learn about setting up a subscriber to receive messages from a subscription
with pull delivery, see Receiving messages using Pull .
Configuring permissions
You can use Pub/Sub permissions to control access to your topics and
subscriptions.
For more information about Pub/Sub permissions and granting access to
topics and subscriptions, see the Pub/Sub
access control documentation .
Notification examples
Pub/Sub sends notifications as JSON-formatted strings. Review the
following examples to learn what to expect when receiving Artifact Registry notifications from Pub/Sub.
When an image is pushed to Artifact Registry, the notification
payload might look like this:
{
"action":"INSERT",
"digest":"us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/hello-world@sha256:6ec128e26cd5..."
}
When a new image tag is pushed to Artifact Registry, the notification
payload looks like this:
{
"action":"INSERT",
"digest":"us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/hello-world@sha256:6ec128e26cd5...",
"tag":"us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/hello-world:1.1"
}
The message identifies the relevant image using either a digest or tag key.
When an image tag is deleted from Artifact Registry, the notification
payload might look like this:
{
"action":"DELETE",
"tag":"us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/hello-world:1.1"
}
The message might contain either DELETE or INSERT as values for the action
key.
