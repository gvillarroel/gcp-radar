Configure restricted access for GKE private clusters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how to configure DNS entries to route requests to
the pkg.dev and gcr.io domains using a restricted virtual IP (VIP) when you
use Google Kubernetes Engine private clusters in a VPC Service Controls
service perimeter.
Registry domains normally resolve to a public IP address on the
internet. In GKE private clusters, nodes are isolated from the
internet by default. This means that requests to registry domains will fail when
you have not configured DNS routing to the restricted VIP.
Your private clusters should always access Artifact Registry or Container Registry
with the restricted VIP to prevent data exfiltration from a supported service to
an unsupported one.
Configure restricted access for GKE private clusters when all of
the following are true:
You're using GKE private clusters.
You haven't already configured routing of the
pkg.dev or gcr.io registry domains to restricted.googleapis.com .
Before you begin
Before you create a service perimeter,
set up a new private cluster
or identify the existing private clusters that you want to protect.
Also, you must permit egress to 199.36.153.4/30 on port 443. Normally, a
VPC network has an implied rule that allows all egress traffic to
any destination. However, if you have a rule denying such traffic, you must
create an egress firewall rule to allow TCP traffic on port 443 to
199.36.153.4/30.
Configuring DNS
Configure your DNS server so that requests to registry addresses resolve to
restricted.googleapis.com , the restricted VIP. You can do so using
Cloud DNS private DNS zones.
Create a managed private zone.
gcloud dns managed-zones create ZONE_NAME \
--visibility = private \
--networks = https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK \
--description = DESCRIPTION \
--dns-name = REGISTRY_DOMAIN \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Where:
ZONE_NAME is a name for the zone you are
creating. For example, registry . This name will be used in
each of the following steps.
PROJECT_ID is the ID of the project that
hosts your GKE private cluster.
NETWORK is an optional list of names of the
cluster network that you want to redirect requests from.
DESCRIPTION is a human-readable description
of the managed zone.
REGISTRY_DOMAIN is the domain for your registry:
pkg.dev for Artifact Registry
gcr.io for Container Registry or
gcr.io repositories hosted in Artifact Registry
Start a transaction.
gcloud dns record-sets transaction start \
--zone = ZONE_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Where:
ZONE_NAME is the name of the zone you created in the first
step.
PROJECT_ID is the ID of the project that hosts your
GKE private cluster.
Add a CNAME record for your registry.
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \
--name = *. REGISTRY_DOMAIN . \
--type = CNAME REGISTRY_DOMAIN . \
--zone = ZONE_NAME \
--ttl = 300 \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Where:
ZONE_NAME is the name of the zone you created
in the first step.
PROJECT_ID is the ID of the project that
hosts your GKE private cluster.
REGISTRY_DOMAIN is the domain for your registry:
pkg.dev for Artifact Registry
gcr.io for Container Registry or
gcr.io repositories hosted in Artifact Registry
Add an A record for the restricted VIP.
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \
--name = REGISTRY_DOMAIN . \
--type = A 199 .36.153.4 199 .36.153.5 199 .36.153.6 199 .36.153.7 \
--zone = ZONE_NAME \
--ttl = 300 \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Where:
ZONE_NAME is the name of the zone you created
in the first step.
PROJECT_ID is the ID of the project that
hosts your GKE private cluster.
REGISTRY_DOMAIN is the domain for your registry:
pkg.dev for Artifact Registry
gcr.io for Container Registry or
gcr.io repositories hosted in Artifact Registry
Execute the transaction.
gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute \
--zone = ZONE_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Where:
ZONE_NAME is the name of the zone you created in the first
step.
PROJECT_ID is the ID of the project that hosts your
GKE private cluster.
After you have configured DNS routing, ensure that your GKE, the
registry, and other required services are inside your VPC Service Controls
service perimeter. To configure your service perimeter, see the following
section.
Configuring the service perimeter
After configuring the DNS records , do the following:
Create a new service perimeter
or update an existing perimeter .
Add the Container Registry or Artifact Registry service to the list of services
you want to protect using the service perimeter.
Add other supported services that you use with the registry to the service perimeter, such as Cloud Build, Artifact Analysis, and Binary Authorization.
If you need to access Container Registry, then you must also add
Cloud Storage to the service perimeter.
Verifying the perimeter works
After configuring the service perimeter , your nodes in
GKE private clusters can access container images in Artifact Registry
and Container Registry if the images are stored in projects that are in your
service perimeter.
Container images in projects outside the perimeter remain inaccessible, except
for some specific read-only public repositories .
For example, if the google-samples project is not in your service perimeter,
running the command to create a deployment from the hello-app container
will fail:
pkg.dev domain
kubectl create deployment hello-server --image = us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
gcr.io domain
kubectl create deployment hello-server --image = gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
Check the status of the pod with the command:
kubectl get pods
The command returns a table similar to the following example. The pod status
ErrImagePull indicates that the pull failed.
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
hello-server-dbd86c8c4-h5wsf 1/1 ErrImagePull 0 45s
You can use the kubectl describe pod command to see more details about the
deployment. For the pod in the previous example, the command is:
kubectl describe pod hello-server-dbd86c8c4-h5wsf
