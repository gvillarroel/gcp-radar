Repository and image names
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Artifact Registry uses a naming convention to identify repositories and images
when you use the API, gcloud , and docker commands to interact with
repositories.
Docker repositories
The full name for a docker repository is in the following format:
LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY
Where:
LOCATION is the regional or multi-regional location of the repository.
PROJECT is your Google Cloud console project ID .
If your project ID contains a colon ( : ), see Domain-scoped projects .
REPOSITORY is the name of the repository.
For example, consider an image with the following characteristics:
Repository location: us-west1
Repository format: docker
Repository name: my-repo
Project ID: my-project
The repository is specified as:
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo
Container image names
The full name for a container image is one of the following formats:
LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE
or
LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE : TAG
or
LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE @ IMAGE-DIGEST
where:
LOCATION is the regional or multi-regional location of the repository.
PROJECT is your Google Cloud console project ID .
If your project ID contains a colon ( : ), see Domain-scoped projects .
REPOSITORY is the name of the repository where the image
is stored.
IMAGE is the name of the image in the repository.
TAG is the tag for the image version that you want to pull.
IMAGE-DIGEST is the sha256 hash value of the image
contents. In Google Cloud console, click the specific image to see its metadata.
The digest is listed as the Image digest . If you don't specify a tag
or a digest, Artifact Registry looks for the image with the default tag
latest . See
Container image versions for information about versions.
For example, consider an image with the following characteristics:
Repository location: us-west1
Repository name: my-repo
Project ID: my-project
Image name: test
Tag: staging
This version of the image tagged with staging is specified as:
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/test:staging
Container image versions
A repository can contain many container images, and these images can have
different versions. To identify a specific version of an image, you
can specify the image digest or tag.
Digest
An image digest is an automatically generated hash of the image index or image
manifest. Each image digest is a unique identifier for an image version and
cannot be changed. The digest is the sha256 hash value of the image contents.
Tag
An image tag is a label and is often a human-readable string such as v1.1 or
development . A tag can only point to only one version of an image. In
Artifact Registry, you can configure a Docker repository to allow mutable
image tags or enforce immutable image tags.
Mutable : A tag points to only one version of an image, but the specific
digest that it references can change.
A common approach is to tag images with a version identifier, such as v1.1
at build time. When the build pushes multiple versions of the image to
the registry with the same v1.1 tag, the tag references the digest of the
last version pushed to the registry. Although mutable image tags provide a
convenient way to label versions, they can also be manipulated by a bad
actor to associate a tag with a malicious version of an image.
Immutable : In the repository, a tag always points to the same image
digest. If an Artifact Registry repository is configured for immutable
image tags, the following actions are not permitted:
Delete a tagged image. Deleting untagged images is still permitted.
Remove a tag from an image.
Push an image with a tag that is already used by another version of
the image in the repository.
For example, consider an image with the following characteristics:
Repository location: us-west1
Repository name: my-repo
Project ID: my-project
Image name: test
Tag: staging
Digest: sha256:4d11e24ba8a615cc85a535daa17b47d3c0219f7eeb2b8208896704ad7f88ae2d
To identify the image with the tag, append :staging to the image name:
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/test:staging
To identify it with the digest, append @ to the image name, followed by the
digest:
us-west1 - docker . pkg . dev / my - project / my - repo / test @sha256 : 4 d11e24ba8a615cc85a535daa17b47d3c0219f7eeb2b8208896704ad7f88ae2d
If your project ID contains a colon ( : ), see Domain-scoped projects .
In the console, on the Images screen, the Tags column lists the image's
tags. Click the version of the image to see metadata, including the
Image digest .
See Tagging Images for more information about
tagging.
Domain-scoped projects
If your project is scoped to your domain, the project ID includes the name of
the domain followed by a colon ( : ). Because of how Docker treats colons,
you must replace the colon character with a forward slash when you specify
an image digest in Artifact Registry. Identify images in these types of
projects using the following format:
LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ DOMAIN / PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE @ IMAGE-DIGEST
For example, the project with ID example.com:my-project could have the
following image:
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/example.com/my-project/my-repo/image-name
Note: Scoping projects to a domain is a legacy feature. You cannot create new
domain-scoped projects.
Repository names as URLs
To access a repository or artifact in a repository in Google Cloud console,
prepend https:// to its full name.
For example, to view the repository us-west1-maven.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo , use
the following URL:
https://us-west1-maven.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo
To view the image us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/example.com/my-project/my-repo/my-image ,
use the following URL:
https://us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/example.com/my-project/my-repo/my-image
Any authenticated user who has permission to access the repository can use these
links.
