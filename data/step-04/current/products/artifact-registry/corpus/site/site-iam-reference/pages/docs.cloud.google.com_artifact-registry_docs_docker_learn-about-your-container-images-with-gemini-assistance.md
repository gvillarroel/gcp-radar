— Gemini Cloud Assist
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This document describes how you can use Gemini Cloud Assist to list
your Artifact Registry repositories and container images stored in
Docker-format repositories.
Learn how and when Gemini
for Google Cloud uses your data .
Limitations
Your Google Cloud project must be created in an organization .
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
If you don't have any container images stored in an Artifact Registry
repository, then follow the instructions in
Store Docker container images in Artifact Registry .
Ensure that
Gemini Cloud Assist is set up for your Google Cloud user
account and project .
Ensure that you have the
necessary Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
to complete the tasks in this document.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to list repositories and container images in Artifact Registry,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Artifact Registry Reader ( roles/artifactregistry.reader )
IAM role on the project or repository.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Open Gemini Cloud Assist chat
As an early-stage technology, Gemini for Google Cloud
products can generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. We recommend that you
validate all output from Gemini for Google Cloud products before you use it.
For more information, see
Gemini for Google Cloud and responsible AI .
You can open the Cloud Assist panel to use Gemini Cloud Assist chat
from anywhere in the Google Cloud console.
In the Google Cloud console, select a project where you have container images
stored in Artifact Registry.
Go to project selector
To open the Cloud Assist panel, click
spark
Open or close Gemini AI chat .
To enter a prompt, type the prompt and click
send Send prompt .
List repositories
You can prompt Gemini Cloud Assist to list repositories in the current project
and filter the response by the following:
Location (required). The location of the repositories you
want to list.
Labels (optional). Labels are key-value pairs that are used
to organize resources.
Tags (optional). Tags are used to group repositories and other
resources across Google Cloud for reporting, auditing, and access control
within your Google Cloud organization.
To list repositories, do the following:
In Gemini Cloud Assist chat, enter the following prompt:
List repositories in the location LOCATION
Replace LOCATION with the location of your
repositories—for example, us-west1 .
For example, the following prompt asks Gemini Cloud Assist
to list repositories in the region us-west1 that have the label
env:dev :
List repositories for us-west1 with the label env:dev
The response includes a list of repositories in the specified location
that have the label env:dev .
List container images
You can prompt Gemini Cloud Assist to list container images in a
Docker format repository in the current project, and filter
the response by the following:
Repository ID (required). The repository ID.
Location (required). The location of the repository you want to list
images from.
Labels (optional). Labels are key-value pairs that are used
to organize resources.
Docker tags (optional). Docker tags are used when you
push or pull an image to a repository to specify the version of an image.
To list your images in a repository, do the following:
In Gemini Cloud Assist chat, enter the following prompt:
List my images for REPOSITORY in LOCATION with the tag TAG
Replace the following:
REPOSITORY : the repository ID
LOCATION : the location of the
repository—for example, us-west1
TAG : a Docker tag—for example, latest
The response includes a list of images that have the specified tag,
repository, and location.
