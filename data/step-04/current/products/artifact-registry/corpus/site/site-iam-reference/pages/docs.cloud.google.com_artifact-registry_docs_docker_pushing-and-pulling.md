Push and pull images
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes pushing and pulling container images with Docker. It also
provides information about pulling images with the crictl tool if you are
troubleshooting issues in Google Kubernetes Engine.
For information about deploying to Google Cloud runtime environments, see
Deploy to Google Cloud .
For instructions on listing, tagging, and deleting images, see
Managing images .
Before you begin
If the target repository does not exist,
create a new repository .
You must have at least Artifact Registry Writer access
to the repository.
To push images with Docker,
install Docker
if it is not already installed.
To push images with Podman, install Podman
Install Google Cloud CLI if it is not already
installed.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to push and pull images,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the repository:
Pull images:
Artifact Registry Reader ( roles/artifactregistry.reader )
Tag and push images:
Artifact Registry Writer ( roles/artifactregistry.writer )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Authenticating to a repository
You must authenticate to repositories whenever you use Docker
or another third-party client with a Docker repository. This section provides
a quick summary of what you'll need to authenticate successfully. For detailed
instructions, see Setting up authentication for Docker .
Using a credential helper
For the gcloud CLI credential helper or
standalone credential helper , the
Artifact Registry hosts you use must be in your Docker configuration file.
Artifact Registry does not automatically add all registry hosts to the
Docker configuration file. Docker response time is significantly slower when
there is a large number of configured registries. To minimize the number of
registries in the configuration file, you add the hosts that you need to the
file.
To confirm which hosts are configured, run the following command to display
the contents of the configuration file:
Linux: cat ~/.docker/config.json
Windows: type %USERPROFILE%\.docker\config.json
The credHelpers section lists configured Artifact Registry Docker hosts.
Host names end in -docker.pkg.dev . The following example shows some hosts
configured for the gcloud CLI credential helper.
"credHelpers" : {
"asia.gcr.io" : "gcloud" ,
"eu.gcr.io" : "gcloud" ,
"gcr.io" : "gcloud" ,
"marketplace.gcr.io" : "gcloud" ,
"northamerica-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev" : "gcloud" ,
"us-central1-docker.pkg.dev" : "gcloud" ,
"us-east1-docker.pkg.dev" : "gcloud" ,
"us.gcr.io" : "gcloud"
}
If a host you want to use is not in the list, run the credential helper again
to add the host. For example, the following command adds
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev .
gcloud CLI credential helper:
gcloud auth configure-docker us-west1-docker.pkg.dev
Standalone credential helper
docker-credential-gcr configure-docker us-west1-docker.pkg.dev
Using an access token
For access token authentication, you generate a token and use it as a password
with the docker login command. Tokens are valid for 60 minutes, so you
should authenticate shortly before you tag, push, or pull images.
The following example generates an access token using service account
impersonation and then
authenticates to Artifact Registry. You must have
have permissions in the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) to generate a token this way.
Linux
gcloud auth print-access-token \
--impersonate-service-account ACCOUNT | docker login \
-u oauth2accesstoken \
--password-stdin https:// LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev
Windows
gcloud auth print-access-token `
- -impersonate-service-account ACCOUNT
ya29 . 8QEQIfY_ ...
docker login -u oauth2accesstoken -p "ya29.8QEQIfY_..." `
https :// LOCATION -docker . pkg . dev
If you don't have permissions to impersonate a service account, you can
activate the service account in your gcloud CLI session and then obtain a token.
For details, see the instructions to set up access token
authentication.
Using a service account key
For a service account key, you use the key as a password with the docker login
command.
For example, the following command uses the base64-encoded service account key
in the file key.json to authenticate to us-west1-docker.pkg.dev .
Linux
cat key.json | docker login -u _json_key_base64 --password-stdin \
https://us-west1-docker.pkg.dev
Windows
docker login -u _json_key_base64 --password-stdin https://us-west1-docker.pkg.dev < key.json
For details, see the instructions to set up service account key authentication.
Pushing an image with Docker
Repository modes : standard
To push a local image to a standard Docker repository, you tag it with the
repository name and then push the image.
If your Artifact Registry Docker repository has tag immutability enabled,
a tag must always reference the same image digest in the repository. You cannot
use the tag on another version of the same image that you push to the
repository. For more information about image digests, tags, and tag
immutability, see Container image versions .
For large images, the following limits apply:
Upload time
If you authenticate to Artifact Registry using an access token, the token
is only valid for 60 minutes. If you expect your upload time to exceed 60 minutes,
use a different authentication method .
Image size
The maximum artifact size is 5 TB.
Artifact Registry does not support Docker chunked uploads .
Some tools support uploading large images with either chunked uploads or a
single monolithic upload . You must use monolithic uploads to push images to
Artifact Registry.
Tagging the local image
Make sure that you are authenticated to the repository.
Determine the name of the image. The format of a full image name is:
LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE
Replace the following values:
LOCATION is the regional or multi-regional location of the repository where the image is stored.
PROJECT-ID is your Google Cloud console project ID .
If your project ID contains a colon ( : ), see Domain-scoped projects .
REPOSITORY is the name of the repository where the image is stored.
IMAGE is the image's name. It can be different than the image's local name.
For example, consider an image with the following characteristics:
Repository location: us-west1
Repository name: my-repo
Project ID: my-project
Local image name: my-image
Target image name: test-image
This image name for this example is:
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/test-image
Note: The name for the image that you will store in the repository can be
different from the image name on your local machine.
For details about the image name format, including handling domain-scoped
projects, see Repository and image names .
Tag the local image with the repository name.
docker tag SOURCE-IMAGE LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE : TAG
Replace SOURCE-IMAGE with the local image name or image ID and
TAG with the tag. If you don't specify a tag, Docker applies the
default latest tag.
If the immutable image tags setting is enabled, tags must be unique for
each image version, including the latest tag. You cannot push an image to
the repository if the tag is already used by another version of the same
image in the repository. To verify if the setting is enabled for the
repository, run the command:
gcloud artifacts repositories describe REPOSITORY \
--project = PROJECT-ID \
--location = LOCATION
For the example image from the previous step, you would use the following
command if the local image my-image is in the current directory:
docker tag my-image us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/test-image
If you want to apply a specific tag, use the command:
docker tag SOURCE-IMAGE LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE : TAG
To use the tag staging with the example image, you add :staging to
the command:
docker tag my-image us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/test-image:staging
Push the tagged image to Artifact Registry
Note: Artifact Registry does not support Docker chunked uploads . Some
container image tools support uploading large container images with either
chunked uploads or a single monolithic upload .
You must use monolithic uploads when you push container images to
Artifact Registry.
Make sure that you are authenticated to the repository.
If you used gcloud auth configure-docker or
docker-credential-gcr configure-docker to configure your Docker client,
verify that the target hostname is in your Docker configuration file .
Push the tagged image with the command:
docker push LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE
This command pushes the image that has the tag latest . If you want to
push an image that has a different tag, use the command:
docker push LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE : TAG
When you push an image, it is stored in the specified repository.
After pushing your image, you can:
Go to the Google Cloud console to view the
image.
Run the gcloud command to view the image's tags and
automatically-generated digest:
gcloud artifacts docker images list \
LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE [ --include-tags ]
The following example output shows truncated image digests, but the command
always returns the full image digest.
IMAGE DIGEST CREATE_TIME UPDATE_TIME
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/my-image sha256:85f... 2019 -04-10T15:08:45 2019 -04-10T15:08:45
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/my-image sha256:238... 2019 -04-10T17:23:53 2019 -04-10T17:23:53
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/my-image sha256:85f... 2019 -04-10T15:08:46 2019 -04-10T15:08:46
Pushing an image with Podman
You can push a container image from Podman to Artifact Registry.
Build your image with Podman using the following command:
podman build -t IMAGE :latest .
Tag your local Podman image for Artifact Registry.
Use the full Artifact Registry path for the tag. The format is the same
as for Docker:
LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / IMAGE : TAG
Run the following command:
podman tag IMAGE-NAME LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / PODMAN-IMAGE : TAG
Authenticate Podman with Artifact Registry. To use it with the
credential helper, run the following command:
gcloud auth configure-docker LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev
Note: By default, Podman looks for credentials in
~/.config/containers/auth.json and falls back to
~/.docker/config.json if the Podman default file doesn't exist or contain the necessary credentials. If you encounter issues, copy the auths section from ~/.docker/config.json to ~/.config/containers/auth.json , or use the podman login command.
If Podman can't obtain credentials automatically, you can also
authenticate with an access token. Run the following command:
gcloud auth print-access-token | podman login -u oauth2accesstoken --password-stdin LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev
Push the tagged image to Artifact Registry:
podman push LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / IMAGE : TAG
Ensure that the tag exactly matches the one you used to tag the local Podman
image.
Pulling images with Docker
Repository modes : standard, remote, virtual
Make sure that you are authenticated to the repository.
If you used gcloud auth configure-docker or
docker-credential-gcr configure-docker to configure your Docker client,
verify that the target hostname is in your Docker configuration file .
To pull from a repository, use the command:
docker pull LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE : TAG
or
docker pull LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE @ IMAGE-DIGEST
Replace the following values:
LOCATION is the regional or multi-regional location of the repository where the image is stored.
PROJECT is your Google Cloud console project ID .
If your project ID contains a colon ( : ), see Domain-scoped projects .
PROJECT is your Google Cloud console project ID .
REPOSITORY is the name of the repository where the image is stored.
IMAGE is the image's name in the repository.
TAG is the tag for the image version that you want to pull.
IMAGE-DIGEST is the sha256 hash value of the image contents. Each version of an image has a unique image digest. In Google Cloud console, click the specific image to see its metadata. The digest is listed as the Image digest .
For example, consider an image with the following characteristics:
Repository location: us-west1
Repository name: my-repo
Project ID: my-project
Image name: test-image
Tag: staging
This command to pull the image is:
docker pull us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/test-image:staging
Docker downloads the specified image.
If you request an image from a remote repository, the remote repository
downloads and caches the image from the upstream source if a cached copy doesn't
exist.
If you request an image from a virtual repository, Artifact Registry
searches upstream repositories for the requested image. If you request a
version that is available in more than one upstream repository,
Artifact Registry chooses an upstream repository to use based on the
priority settings configured for the virtual repository.
For example, consider a virtual repository with the following priority settings
for upstream repositories:
main-repo : Priority set to 100
secondary-repo1 : Priority set to 80 .
secondary-repo2 : Priority set to 80 .
test-repo : Priority set to 20 .
main-repo has the highest priority value, so the virtual repository
always searches it first.
Both secondary-repo1 and secondary-repo2 have priority set to 80 . If a
requested image is not available in main-repo , Artifact Registry
searches these repositories next. Since they both have the same priority value,
Artifact Registry can choose to serve an image from either repository
if the version is available in both of them.
test-repo has is lowest priority value and will serve a stored artifact if
none of the other upstream repositories has it.
Pulling images with crictl
crictl is a useful command-line tool for CRI runtime developers to debug
their runtime without needing to set up Kubernetes components. If your
Google Kubernetes Engine nodes use a containerd runtime, you can pull images from
Artifact Registry using crictl .
Since crictl is primarily a troubleshooting tool, some docker commands such as
pushing or tagging images are not available.
To pull an image from Artifact Registry:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to VM Instances
SSH into
the node you are troubleshooting.
Obtain an access token for authentication with the repository.
curl -s "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token" -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google"
Pull the image using crictl pull --creds and the access_token value
crictl pull --creds "oauth2accesstoken: ACCESS_TOKEN " LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE : TAG
or
crictl pull --creds "oauth2accesstoken: ACCESS_TOKEN " LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT-ID / REPOSITORY / IMAGE @ IMAGE-DIGEST
The output looks like the following:
Image is up to date for sha256:0f25067aa9c180176967b4b50ed49eed096d43fa8c17be9a5fa9bff05933bee5
