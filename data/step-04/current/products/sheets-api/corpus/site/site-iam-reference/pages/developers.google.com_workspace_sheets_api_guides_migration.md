Migrate from Sheets API v3
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Important: The Google Sheets API v3 was turned down on August 2, 2021. Use this
guide to migrate to Sheets API v4. For more information about this change,
read the blog post
If you have existing apps based on the Google Sheets API v3, you can migrate to
Google Sheets API v4. The v4 version is JSON-based, has an easier-to-use
interface, and adds a substantial amount of functionality that is not possible
in the v3 version.
This page provides a mapping between the older Sheets API v3 commands
and their equivalent operations in Sheets API v4. The mapping focuses
largely on the
spreadsheets.values
collection, which provides direct cell read and write functionality. Other
aspects, such as adding sheets or updating sheet properties are handled by the
spreadsheets collection.
Note that the v4 API's JSON structures are not backward-compatible with the XML
structures used in v3.
For more information about the resources available in the Sheets
v4 API, see the API Reference .
Notation and terms
The v3 API refers to sheets within a particular spreadsheet as "worksheets".
This is synonymous with the term "sheets" that the v4 API uses.
The APIs often require you to specify a spreadsheet
ID of the spreadsheet you
are working with. They also often require the ID of the sheet being manipulated.
These values appear either as part of the API endpoint URL, as query parameters,
or as part of a request body. In this page, the placeholders spreadsheetId
and sheetId refer to the spreadsheet and sheet IDs, respectively.
When using the methods described on this page, substitute in the actual IDs in
these locations.
The v3 API also assigns an ID to rows retrieved using its
list feed ;
this is represented in this page by the rowId placeholder.
Authorize requests
When your app runs, it asks users to grant certain permissions; the scopes that
you specify in your application determine which permissions it asks for.
v3 API
The Sheets API v3 operates with a single authorization scope:
https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds
which is an alias for
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets
Either scope format can be used.
v4 API
The Sheets API v4 uses one or more of the following set of scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
Use read-only scopes if the your application does not need to make edits to
a user's sheets or sheet properties. Use spreadsheets scopes instead of
Drive scopes if the application does not need general Drive access.
Visibility
In older versions of the API, the term visibility is used to refer to the
availability of a given spreadsheet.
v3 API
The Sheets API v3 expresses visibility directly in its endpoints. A public
spreadsheet has been "Published to the Web" and thus can be accessed by the
API without authorization, while a private spreadsheet does require
authentication. Visibility is specified in the endpoint after the
spreadsheet ID:
https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/ spreadsheetId / private /full
v4 API
In the new Sheets API v4, there is no explicit declaration of visibility.
API calls are made using spreadsheet IDs. If the application does not have
permission to access specified spreadsheet, an error is returned. Otherwise
the call proceeds.
Projection
The term projection is used by the Sheets API v3 to refer to the set of data
that is returned by a given API call—either all of it, or a fixed subset
defined within the API. The Sheets API v4 does not use projection; rather, it
allows you more control over what data is returned.
v3 API
There are only two possible projection settings in the Sheets API v3. full
projection returns all the available information, whereas basic returns a
smaller, fixed subset of data (for the worksheets, list, and cells feeds).
Like visibility, the projection must be specified in the API endpoint
(after the visibility setting):
https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/ spreadsheetId /public/ basic
The smaller subset of data provided by the basic projection is valuable
for making code more efficient, but cannot be customized.
v4 API
While the Sheets API v4 can return a full data set, it does not define fixed
subsets analogous to the basic visibility setting the Sheets API v3.
Methods in the spreadsheet
collection restrict the amount of data they return through the use of
a fields query parameter.
For example, the following query only returns the titles of all the
sheets in a particular spreadsheet:
GET https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId ?fields=sheets.properties.title
Create a spreadsheet
v3 API
The Sheets API v3 does not provide a means to create new spreadsheets;
instead, the Drive API Files.create
method can be used to create new spreadsheet files. This requires the
application to declare the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive scope.
v4 API
The Drive API Files.create method can
also be used with the Sheets API v4, but requires the application to provide
the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive scope.
As an equivalent alternative, the Sheets API v4 provides a
spreadsheets.create
method, which can also optionally add sheets, set the spreadsheet and sheet
properties, and add named ranges. For example, the following creates a new
spreadsheet and gives it the name "NewTitle":
POST https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets
{
"properties": {"title": "NewTitle"}
}
List spreadsheets for the authenticated user
v3 API
The Sheets API v3 feed allows an application to retrieve a list of all the
spreadsheets accessible by the authenticated user. The spreadsheet feed
endpoint is:
GET https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/spreadsheets/private/full
v4 API
The Sheets API v4 does not provide this specific operation. We recommend
migrating your app to use the drive.file scope in combination with the
Google Picker for spreadsheet selection.
In the cases where listing spreadsheets is required, it can be replicated
via the Drive API Files.list method, using
a mimeType query:
GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files
?q=mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet'
Using the Drive API files.list method to list all of a user’s spreadsheets
requires a restricted scope.
Retrieve sheet metadata
The Sheets API v3 provides a feed to access the sheet metadata
contained within a given spreadsheet (row and cell data is accessed through
a separate feed). The metadata includes information such as sheet titles and
size information.
The Sheets API v4
spreadsheets.get
method provides access to this information, and much more.
v3 API
The worksheet feed is accessible from this API endpoint (using an
appropriate authorization header):
GET https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/ spreadsheetId /private/full
The response to this request has a structure similar to this, with
each sheet's data contained in a separate <entry> :
< feed xmlns = "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
xmlns : openSearch = "http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/"

< / entry >
< / feed >
v4 API
The spreadsheets.get
method can be used to acquire sheet properties and other metadata—much
more than what is available using the Sheets API v3. If you only
want to read the sheet properties, set the includeGridData query
parameter to false to prevent the inclusion of the spreadsheet cell data:
GET https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId ?includeGridData=false
The Spreadsheet
response contains an array of Sheet
objects; the sheet titles and size information specifically can be found
under the SheetProperties
element of these objects. For example:
{
"spreadsheetId": spreadsheetId ,
"sheets": [
{"properties": {
"sheetId": sheetId ,
"title": "Sheet1",
"index": 0,
"gridProperties": {
"rowCount": 100,
"columnCount": 20,
"frozenRowCount": 1,
"frozenColumnCount": 0,
"hideGridlines": false
},
...
},
...
},
...
],
...
}
Add a sheet to a spreadsheet
Both APIs allow you to add new sheets to an existing spreadsheet.
v3 API
The Sheets API v3 can add new worksheets to a spreadsheet by making the
following (authenticated) POST request. You can specify the size of the
new sheet:
POST https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/ spreadsheetId /private/full
<entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
xmlns:gs="http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006">
<title>Expenses</title>
<gs:rowCount>50</gs:rowCount>
<gs:colCount>10</gs:colCount>
</entry>
v4 API
You can add new sheets by making an
AddSheet
request in the spreadsheets.batchUpdate
method. As part of request body, you can specify the sheet properties for
the new sheet; all properties are optional. It is an error to provide a
title that is used for an existing sheet.
POST https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId :batchUpdate
{
"requests": [{
"addSheet": {
"properties": {
"title": "Expenses",
"sheetType": "GRID",
"gridProperties": {
"rowCount": 50,
"columnCount": 10
}
}
}
}],
}
Change a sheet title and size
The Sheets API v3 lets you update sheet titles and size; the
Sheets API v4 allows this as well, but can also be used to update
other sheet properties. Note that reducing a sheet's size may cause data in the
cropped cells to be deleted without warning.
v3 API
To change the title or size of a worksheet, begin by retrieving the
worksheet feed and
finding the desired worksheet entry, which contains an edit URL.
Update the worksheet's metadata and send it as the body of a PUT request
to the edit URL. For example:
PUT https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/ spreadsheetId /private/full/ sheetId /version
< entry >
< id >
https : //spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/spreadsheetId/private/full/sheetId
< / id >
< updated>2007 - 07 - 30 T18 : 51 : 30.666 Z < / updated >
< category scheme = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006"
term = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#worksheet" / >
< title type = "text" > Expenses < / title >
< content type = "text" > Expenses < / content >
< link rel = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#listfeed"
type = "application/atom+xml" href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full" / >
< link rel = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#cellsfeed"
type = "application/atom+xml" href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full" / >
< link rel = "self" type = "application/atom+xml"
href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/spreadsheetId/private/full/sheetId" / >
< link rel = "edit" type = "application/atom+xml"
href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/spreadsheetId/private/full/sheetId/version" / >
< gs : rowCount>45 < / gs : rowCount >
< gs : colCount>15 < / gs : colCount >
< / entry >
v4 API
To update the size, title, and other sheet properties, make an
updateSheetProperties
request in the
spreadsheets.batchUpdate
method. The POST request body should contain the properties to be
changed, and the fields parameter should explicitly list those properties
(if you want to update all properties, use fields:"*" as a shorthand for
listing them all). For
example, the following specifies that the sheet title and size
properties should be updated for the sheet with the given ID:
POST https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId :batchUpdate
{
"requests": [
{
"updateSheetProperties": {
"properties": {
"sheetId": sheetId ,
"title": "Expenses",
"gridProperties": {
"rowCount": 45,
"columnCount": 15,
}
},
"fields": "title,gridProperties(rowCount,columnCount)"
}
}
],
}
To retrieve a sheet's sheetId , use the spreadsheet
spreadsheets.get method.
Delete a sheet
Either API can remove sheets from a given spreadsheet.
v3 API
To delete a worksheet, begin by retrieving the
worksheet feed , then
send a DELETE request on the edit URL of the target worksheet entry.
DELETE https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/ spreadsheetId /private/full/ sheetId /version
v4 API
To delete a sheet, make a
DeleteSheet
request in the
spreadsheets.batchUpdate
method. The POST request body should only contain the sheetId for the
sheet to be deleted. For example:
POST https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId :batchUpdate
{
"requests": [
{
"deleteSheet": {
"sheetId": sheetId
}
}
],
}
To retrieve an individual sheet's sheetId , use the
spreadsheet spreadsheets.get
method.
Retrieve row data
The list rows feed is one of the two methods the Sheets API v3 provides to
access data within a spreadsheet's cells (the other being the cells feed ). The
rows feed is meant to support common spreadsheet operations (reading row by row,
appending rows, sorting), but makes certain assumptions that make it unsuitable
for some tasks. Specifically, the list feed assumes that blank rows are feed
terminations, and that mandatory headers are present in the first row of a
sheet.
In contrast, the Sheets API v4 does not use access methods that are
row-specific. Instead, sheet cell data is accessed by referencing the specific
ranges required using A1 notation . The
ranges can be blocks of cells, entire rows, entire columns, or entire sheets.
The API can also access disjoint sets of cells.
v3 API
To determine the URL of a list-based feed for a given worksheet, retrieve
the worksheet feed and
find the list feed URL in the worksheet entry of interest.
To retrieve a list-based feed, send a GET request to the list feed URL,
using an appropriate authorization header. For example:
GET https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full
The response to this request contain, among other things, entries
corresponding to specific rows. Individual cells are referenced by
the names provided in the (mandatory) sheet header row. For example, here
is a single row entry:
< entry gd : etag = ' "S0wCTlpIIip7ImA0X0QI" ' >
< id>rowId < / id >
< updated>2006 - 11 - 17 T18 : 23 : 45.173 Z < / updated >
< category scheme = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006"
term = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list" / >
< title type = "text" > Bingley < / title >
< content type = "text" > Hours : 10 , Items : 2 , IPM : 0.0033 < / content >
< link rel = "self" type = "application/atom+xml"
href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/rowId" / >
< link rel = "edit" type = "application/atom+xml"
href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/rowId/version" / >
< gsx : name>Bingley < / gsx : name >
< gsx : hours>10 < / gsx : hours >
< gsx : items>2 < / gsx : items >
< gsx : ipm>0 .0033 < / gsx : ipm >
< / entry >
By default the rows returned in the list feed are returned in row order.
The Sheets API v3 provides query parameters to change that order.
Reverse order:
GET https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full?reverse=true
Order by a specific column:
GET https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full
?orderby=column:lastname
The Sheets API v3 also allows filtering of specific rows via a structured
query (referenced by column headers):
GET https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full
?sq=age>25%20and%20height<175
v4 API
With the Sheets API v4, rows can be retrieved by range using the
spreadsheets.values.get
or spreadsheets.values.batchGet
methods. For example, the following returns all rows in "Sheet1":
GET https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId /values/Sheet1
The response to this request has a structure similar to:
{
"range": "Sheet1",
"majorDimension": "ROWS",
"values": [["Name", "Hours", "Items", "IPM"],
["Bingley", "10", "2", "0.0033"],
["Darcy", "14", "6", "0.0071"]]
}
Trailing empty cells are not included in the response when retrieving entire
rows, columns, or sheets.
The Sheets API v4 does not have equivalents for the row-order query
parameters provided by the Sheets API v3. Reverse-order is trivial; simply
process the returned values array in reverse order. Order by column is not
supported for reads, but it is possible to sort the data in the sheet (using
a SortRange )
request and then read it.
The Sheets API v4 does not currently have a direct equivalent for the Sheets API v3 structured queries. However, you can retrieve the relevant data and
sort through it as needed in your application.
Add a new row of data
You can add a new row of data to a sheet using either API.
v3 API
To determine the URL of a list-based feed for a given worksheet, retrieve
the worksheet feed and
find the post URL in the worksheet entry of interest.
To add a row of data, send a POST request to the post URL,
using an appropriate authorization header. For example:
POST https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full
The body of the POST request should contain an entry for the row data to
add, with individual cells referenced by column headers:
<entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
xmlns:gsx="http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006/extended">
<gsx:hours>2</gsx:hours>
<gsx:ipm>0.5</gsx:ipm>
<gsx:items>60</gsx:items>
<gsx:name>Elizabeth</gsx:name>
</entry>
New rows are appended to the end of the specified sheet.
v4 API
With the Sheets API v4, you can append rows using the
spreadsheets.values.append
method. The following example writes a new row of data below the last
table in "Sheet1" of a spreadsheet.
POST https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId /append/Sheet1
{
"values": [["Elizabeth", "2", "0.5", "60"]]
}
Additionally, the Sheets API v4 also lets you append cells with specific
properties and formatting using the
AppendCells
requests in a
spreadsheets.batchUpdate .
Edit a row with new data
Both APIs allow row data to be updated with new values.
v3 API
To edit a row of data, examine the list feed
to locate the entry for the row you wish to update. Update the contents of
that entry as needed. Be sure that the ID value in the entry you use exactly
matches the ID of the existing entry.
Once the entry has been updated, send a PUT request with the entry as the
request body to the edit URL provided in that row entry,
using an appropriate authorization header. For example:
PUT https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full/ rowId /version
< entry gd : etag = ' "S0wCTlpIIip7ImA0X0QI" ' >
< id>rowId < / id >
< updated>2006 - 11 - 17 T18 : 23 : 45.173 Z < / updated >
< category scheme = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006"
term = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list" / >
< title type = "text" > Bingley < / title >
< content type = "text" > Hours : 10 , Items : 2 , IPM : 0.0033 < / content >
< link rel = "self" type = "application/atom+xml"
href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/rowId" / >
< link rel = "edit" type = "application/atom+xml"
href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/rowId/version" / >
< gsx : name>Bingley < / gsx : name >
< gsx : hours>20 < / gsx : hours >
< gsx : items>4 < / gsx : items >
< gsx : ipm>0 .0033 < / gsx : ipm >
< / entry >
v4 API
With Sheets API v4, you can edit a row using the
A1 notation of the row you wish to
edit and issuing a
spreadsheets.values.update
request to overwrite that row. The range specified need only refer to the
first cell in the row; the API infers the cells to update based on the
values provided with the request. If you instead specify a multi-cell range,
the values you provide must fit within that range; if not the API returns an
error.
The following example request and request body adds data to the
fourth row of "Sheet1":
PUT https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId /values/Sheet1!A4
{
"values": [["Elizabeth", "2", "0.5", "60"]]
}
You can also update row data from the
spreadsheet.values.batchUpdate
method; it is more efficient to use this method if you are making multiple
row or cell updates.
Additionally, the Sheets API v4 also lets you edit the cell properties and
formatting of cells using the
UpdateCells
or
RepeatCell
requests in a
spreadsheets.batchUpdate .
Delete a row
Both APIs support the deletion of rows. A deleted row is removed from the
spreadsheet, and rows below it are pushed up one.
v3 API
To delete a row, first retrieve the row to delete from the
list feed ,
then send a DELETE request to the edit URL provided in the row's entry.
This is the same URL used to update the row.
DELETE https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full/ rowId /version
If you want to make sure that you don't delete a row that has been changed
by another client since you retrieved it, include an HTTP If-Match header
that contains the original row's ETag value. You can determine the original
row's ETag value by examining the entry element's gd:etag attribute.
If you want to delete the row regardless of whether someone else has updated
it since you retrieved it, then use If-Match: * and don't include the ETag.
(In this case, you don't need to retrieve the row before deleting it.)
v4 API
Deleting rows with the Sheets API v4 is handled by a spreadsheet.batchUpdate
method call, using a DeleteDimension
request. This request can also be used to remove columns, and developers
and choose to only remove part of a row or column. For example, the
following removes the 6th row of a sheet with the given ID (the row indices
are zero-based, with the startIndex inclusive and endIndex exclusive):
POST https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId :batchUpdate
{
"requests": [
{
"deleteDimension": {
"range": {
"sheetId": sheetId ,
"dimension": "ROWS",
"startIndex": 5,
"endIndex": 6
}
}
}
],
}
A sheet's sheetId can be retrieved using the
spreadsheet.get method.
Retrieve cell data
The Sheets API v3 provides a cell feed for basic access to all data stored in a
spreadsheet. For read access, the cell feed can provide the entire sheet
content or a range of the sheet's cells defined by a set of query parameters,
but only as a single block—disjoint ranges have to be retrieved
separately using additional GET requests.
The Sheets API v4 can retrieve any set of cell data from a sheet (including
multiple disjoint ranges). The Sheets API v3 can only return cell contents as
input values (as would be entered by a user at a keyboard) and/or the outputs of
formula (if numeric); the Sheets API v4 grants full access to values,
formulas, formatting, hyperlinks, data validation, and other properties.
v3 API
To determine the URL of a cell-based feed for a given worksheet, examine the
worksheet feed
and find the cell feed URL in the worksheet entry of interest.
To retrieve a cell-based feed, send a GET request to the cell feed URL,
using an appropriate authorization header. For example:
GET https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full
Cells are referenced using row and column number. Fetching a single specific
range can be done by using max-row , min-row , max-col and min-col
query parameters. For example, the following retrieves all cells in column
4 (D), starting with row 2:
GET https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full
?min-row=2&min-col=4&max-col=4
The Sheets API v3 returns the inputValue of retrieved cells—the
value that a user would otherwise type into the Google Sheets user
interface to manipulate the cell. The inputValue can be a literal value
or a formula. The API also sometimes returns a numericValue ; for example,
when a formula results in a number. For example, a response may include cell
entries similar in structure to the following:
< entry gd : etag = ' "ImB5CBYSRCp7" ' >
< id>https : //spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/R9C4</id>
< updated>2006 - 11 - 17 T18 : 27 : 32.543 Z < / updated >
< category scheme = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006"
term = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#cell" / >
< title type = "text" > D4 < / title >
< content type = "text" > 5 < / content >

< gs : cell row = "4" col = "4" inputValue = "=FLOOR(C4/(B4*60),.0001)"
numericValue = "5.0" > 5 < / gs : cell >
< / entry >
v4 API
Retrieve cell data by calling a
spreadsheets.values.get
or spreadsheets.values.batchGet
method for the range or ranges of interest, respectively. For example, the
following returns the cells in column D of "Sheet2", starting with row 2,
in column-major order and returning formulas as entered (trailing empty
cells are omitted):
GET https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId /values/Sheet2!D2:D?majorDimension=COLUMNS&valueRenderOption=FORMULA
The response to this request is similar in structure to:
{
"spreadsheetId": spreadsheetId ,
"valueRanges": [
{"range": "Sheet2!D2:D",
"majorDimension": "COLUMNS",
"values": [["Widget", 234, "=FLOOR(C4/(B4*60),.0001)", "=D4\*1000"]]
}]
}
It is more efficient to use
spreadsheet.values.batchGet
if you intend to retrieve multiple ranges of cell data. If you want to
access cell properties such as formatting, the
spreadsheet.get
method is required.
Edit a cell
The Sheets API v3 lets you edit cell content by issuing a PUT command to
the cell feed with the modified cell entry as the request body.
The Sheets API v4, in contrast, provides
spreadsheets.values.update
and
spreadsheets.values.batchUpdate
methods for changing cell content.
v3 API
To edit a single cell's content, first find the cell's entry in the
cell feed .
The entry contains an edit URL. Update the entry to reflect the contents
you want the cell to have, and then issue a PUT request to the edit url
with the updated cell entry as the body of the request. For example, the
following updates cell D2 (R2C4) to contain a SUM formula:
PUT https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full//R2C4/srevc
<entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
xmlns:gs="http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006">
<id>https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/R2C4</id>
<link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"
href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/R2C4"/>
<gs:cell row="2" col="4" inputValue="=SUM(A1:B6)"/>
</entry>
v4 API
Single cell editing in the Sheets API v4 can be done with the
spreadsheets.values.update
method. This method requires a ValueInputOption query parameter, which
specifies whether the input data is treated as if entered into the
Sheets UI ( USER_ENTERED ), or left unparsed and taken as is ( RAW ). For
example, the following updates cell D2 with a formula:
PUT https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId /values/D2?valueInputOption=USER_ENTERED
{"values": [["=SUM(A1:B6)"]]}
If you are making multiple cell edits, use the
spreadsheets.values.batchUpdate
method to issue them in one request.
Edit multiple cells via batch request
Both APIs provide the means to make changes to the content of multiple cells
with a single (batch) request. The cells referred to by a batch request are
not required to be in a contiguous range.
In the case where one or more of the cell edits in the batch fail, the Sheets API v3 allows others to succeed. However, the Sheets API v4 returns an error
if any of the batched updates fail, and does not apply any of them in that case.
v3 API
To edit multiple cells, first retrieve a cell feed
for the worksheet. The entry contains a batch URL. Send a POST
request to this URL, along with a request body describing the cells you
wish to update and the new cell content. The POST request and request body
have a structure similar to the following:
POST https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/ spreadsheetId / sheetId /private/full/batch
< feed xmlns = "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
xmlns : batch = "http://schemas.google.com/gdata/batch"
xmlns : gs = "http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006" >
< id>https : //spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full</id>
< entry >
< batch : id>request1 < / batch : id >
< batch : operation type = "update" / >
< id>https : //spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/R2C4</id>
< link rel = "edit" type = "application/atom+xml"
href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/R2C4/version" / >
< gs : cell row = "2" col = "4" inputValue = "newData" / >
< / entry >
...
< entry >
< batch : id>request2 < / batch : id >
< batch : operation type = "update" / >
< id>https : //spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/R2C5</id>
< link rel = "edit" type = "application/atom+xml"
href = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/spreadsheetId/sheetId/private/full/R2C5/version" / >
< gs : cell row = "5" col = "2" inputValue = "moreInfo" / >
< / entry >
< / feed >
The batch:id field should uniquely identify the request within the batch.
The batch:operation field should be update for cell edits. gs:cell
identifies the cell by row and column number and provides the new data
to insert there. id contains the full URL to the cell to be updated.
link must have a href attribute that contains the full path to the
cell's ID. All of these fields are required for each entry.
v4 API
The Sheets API v4 provides batch editing of cell values through the
spreadsheets.values.batchUpdate
method.
Editing multiple cells can be done by issuing a POST request with the
data changes specified in the request body. For example:
POST https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/ spreadsheetId /values:batchUpdate
{
"valueInputOption": "USER_ENTERED"
"data": [
{"range": "D4",
"majorDimension": "ROWS",
"values": [["newData"]]
},
{"range": "B5",
"majorDimension": "ROWS",
"values": [["moreInfo"]]
}
]
}
If you specified a single cell as the range, all values provided are
written to the sheet starting with that cell as the upper-left coordinate.
If you instead specify a multi-cell range, the values you provide must fit
that range exactly; if not the API returns an error.
