Date and number formats
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how to define new date and number format patterns, which
you can include in your API request.
Date-time and number formats let you control how your data appears in a sheet.
Google Sheets provides some common formats to choose from, but you can also
define your own formats.
In the Sheets UI, you apply number and date formats to cells
using the
Format > Number menu. In the Google Sheets API, you set these formats using
a
spreadsheets.batchUpdate
method call to send an
UpdateCellsRequest
or
RepeatCellRequest .
The sample Set a custom datetime or decimal format for a
range shows how to set
a format pattern using the Sheets API. Note that the actual rendering
of the format depends on the spreadsheet's
locale .
This document assumes the locale is en_US . You can determine the locale of
a spreadsheet by reading the
SpreadsheetProperties
object using the
spreadsheets.get
method on the
spreadsheets resource.
For more samples, see Basic
formatting and Conditional
formatting .
About date and time values
Sheets, like most other spreadsheet applications, treats date and
time values as decimal values. This lets you perform arithmetic on them in
formulas, so you can increment days or weeks, add or subtract two dates and
times, and perform other similar operations.
Sheets uses a form of epoch
date that's commonly used in
spreadsheets. The whole number portion of the value (left of the decimal) counts
the days since December 30, 1899. The fractional portion (right of the decimal)
counts the time as a fraction of one day. For example, January 1, 1900 at noon
is 2.5 , 2 because it's 2 days after December 30, 1899, and 0.5 because
noon is half a day. February 1, 1900 at 3 PM is 33.625 .
Sheets correctly treats the year 1900 as a common year, not a
leap year.
Note: When you read cell values, you can get dates rendered as strings instead
of as serial values by using the
spreadsheet.values.get
method together with the
dateTimeRenderOption
query parameter.
Date and time format patterns
A date-time format pattern is a string of token substrings that, when parsed,
are replaced with the corresponding date-time elements (such as the month or
hour).
Date and time format tokens
The following table defines the token substrings you can use in a date-time
format pattern. A + character indicates that the previous character can appear
one or more times and still match the pattern. Characters not listed in this
table are treated as literals, and are output without changes.
Token
Description
h
Hour of the day. Switches between 12 and 24-hour format depending on
whether an AM or PM indicator is present in the string.
hh+
Same as previous, but with a leading 0 for 1-9.
m
If the previous non-literal token was hours or the subsequent one is
seconds, it represents minutes in the hour (without a leading 0). Otherwise,
it represents the month of the year as a number (without a leading 0).
M
The month of the year without a leading 0. Use this token to expressly state a month, instead of a minute, in your pattern.
mm
Same as m , but with a leading 0 for both cases.
MM
The month of the year with a leading 0. Use this token to expressly state a month, instead of a minute, in your pattern.
mmm
Three letter month abbreviation (for example, "Feb").
mmmm
Full month name. mmmmmm+ also matches this.
mmmmm
First letter of the month (for example, "J" for June).
s
Seconds in the minute without a leading 0.
ss
Seconds in the minute with a leading 0.
[h+]
Number of elapsed hours in a time duration. Number of letters
indicates minimum number of digits (adds leading 0s).
[m+]
Number of elapsed minutes in a time duration. Number of letters
indicates minimum number of digits (adds leading 0s).
[s+]
Number of elapsed seconds in a time duration. Number of letters
indicates minimum number of digits (adds leading 0s).
d
Day of the month, without a leading 0 for numbers less than 10.
dd
Day of the month, with a leading 0 for numbers less than 10.
ddd
Day of the week, three-letter abbreviation (for example, "Mon").
dddd+
Day of the week, full name.
y
2-digit year.
yy
yyy
4-digit year.
yyyy+
a/p
Displays "a" for AM, and "p" for PM. Also changes hours to
12-hour format. If the token letter is capitalized, the output is,
too.
am/pm
As above, but displays "AM" or "PM" instead and is always
capitalized.
0
Tenths of seconds. You can increase the precision to two digits with
00 or three digits (milliseconds) with 000 .
\
Treats the next character as a literal value and not any special
meaning it might have.
"text"
Displays whatever text is inside the quotation marks as a literal.

Number format patterns
A number format pattern is a string of token substrings that, when parsed, are
replaced with the corresponding number representations. A number format pattern
can consist of up to four sections, separated by semicolons, which define the
separate formats used for positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and text (in
that order):
[POSITIVE FORMAT];[NEGATIVE FORMAT];[ZERO FORMAT];[TEXT FORMAT]
You don't need to include all four sections in a format. If you only include one
section, that format is used for all values. Using two sections causes the first
format to be applied to zero and positive numbers and the second format to
negative numbers. Using three sections defines separate formats for positive,
negative, and zero numbers. For example:
[NUMBER FORMAT]
[POSITIVE/ZERO FORMAT];[NEGATIVE FORMAT]
[POSITIVE FORMAT];[NEGATIVE FORMAT];[ZERO FORMAT]
However, if there are two or more sections and the final section is a text
format, that section is treated as the text format and the others behave as if
there's one less section. Thus, by including a final text format it's possible
to define formats such as:
[POSITIVE/ZERO FORMAT];[NEGATIVE FORMAT];[TEXT FORMAT]
[NUMBER FORMAT];[TEXT FORMAT]
The parsing of a format into sections occurs before other parsing, so it's
possible to have a date or time format included as one of the sections (though
this is of limited utility).
Number format tokens
The following table defines the token substrings you can use in a format section
to define how to represent the values for that section.
Token
Description
0
Represents a digit in the number. If the digit is an insignificant 0,
it's rendered as 0. For example, the number format
00.0 renders the number 3 as " 03.0 ".
#
Represents a digit in the number. If the digit is an insignificant 0,
it's not rendered. For example, the number format ##0
renders the number 12 as " 12 ".
?
Represents a digit in the number. If the digit is an insignificant 0,
it's rendered as a space. This is often used to align the decimal point in
a column when using fixed-width fonts. For example, the number format
???.??? renders the number 12.4 as:
" 12.4 ".
.
The first period represents the decimal point in the number. Subsequent
periods are rendered as literals. If you include a decimal point in the
format, it's always rendered, even for whole numbers. For example,
#0.# renders the number 3 as " 3. ".
%
Appears as a literal but also causes existing numbers to be multiplied
by 100 before being rendered to make percentages more
readable. For example, the number format #%
renders the number 0.25 as " 25% ".
,
If it appears between two-digit characters ( 0 ,
# , or ? ), it renders the entire number
with grouping separators (grouping by the thousands). If it follows
the digit characters, it scales the digits by one thousand per
comma (for example, the format #0.0,, renders the number
12,200,000 as 12.2 ).
E-
Renders the number in scientific format, with the
formatting to the left of the E used for the non-exponent
portion and the formatting to the right of the E used for the exponent
portion. E+ shows a + sign for positive
exponents. E- only shows a sign for negative exponents. If
lowercase is used, the output e is in lowercase as well.
For example, the number format ##0.00#E+##
renders the number 0.0000001 as " 100.00E-9 ".
E+
e-
e+
/
If it appears between two-digit characters ( 0 ,
# , or ? ), it treats those digit groups as a
fractional format. For example, the number format 0 #/# renders
the number 23.25 as 23 1/4 . The denominator
can also be a literal integer, in which case it enforces that integer as
the denominator. The number format 0 #/8
displays the number 23.25 as 23 2/8 . The fraction part is not
rendered if the numerator becomes 0. The number
23.1 with the number format 0 #/3 renders as just
23 (because the 0.1 is rounded to 0/3). / is
not compatible with scientific format or a format with a decimal point
in it.
*
This is included for compatibility with Microsoft Excel number formats. It's ignored.
_
The underscore token skips the next character and renders a space. This is used to line up
number formats where the negative value is surrounded by parentheses.
\
Treats the next character as a literal value and not any special
meaning it might have. For example, the number format \#0
renders the number 10 as " #10 ".
"text"
Displays whatever text is inside the quotation marks as a literal.
@
If the cell has text input, it inserts the raw text for the cell. Not
compatible with any of the other special characters and it doesn't display for
numeric values (which are displayed as general format).
$ - + ( ) : space
Sheets treats these characters as literals and displays them
unchanged.
Meta instructions
In addition, each of the format sections can have optional meta instructions,
enclosed in [] characters, that precede the format and provide additional
instructions. There are two meta instruction types and a given section can use
both:
Instruction
Description
[ condition ]
Replaces the default positive, negative, or zero comparison of the
section with another conditional expression. For example,
[<100]"Low";[>1000]"High";000 renders the word
"Low" for values below 100, "High" for values above 1000, and a three-digit
number (with leading 0s) for anything in between. Conditions can only be
applied to the first two sub-formats and if a number matches more than one,
it uses the first one it matches. If there's a third format, it's
used for "everything else", otherwise if a number doesn't match either
format, it's rendered as all "#"s filling up the cell width. If it exists, the
fourth format is always used for text.
[ Color ] or [ Color# ]
Causes any value this sub-format renders to appear with the
given text color. Valid values for Color are Black,
Blue, Cyan, Green, Magenta, Red, White, or Yellow.
Valid values for the "#" in Color# are from 1 to 56. Number format
colors override any user-entered colors on the cell, but don't override
colors set by conditional formatting. This
color palette
shows a list of colors that correspond to each number. They're based on
the ColorIndex
property in Microsoft Excel.
