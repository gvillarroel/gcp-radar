Migrate to the latest version of Cloud Speech-to-Text API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud Speech-to-Text API V2 brings the latest Google Cloud API design for customers
to meet enterprise security and regulatory requirements out of the box.
These requirements are realized through the following:
Data residency : Cloud STT V2 offers the broad
range of our existing transcription models in Google Cloud
regions such as Belgium or
Singapore. This allows the invocation of our transcription models through a
fully regionalized service.
Recognizer resourcefulness : Recognizers are
reusable recognition configurations that can contain a combination of model,
language, and features.
Logging : Resource creation and transcriptions generate logs available in
the Google Cloud console, allowing for better telemetry and debugging.
Encryption : Cloud Speech-to-Text V2 supports Customer-managed
encryption keys for all resources as well as batch
transcription.
Audio auto-detect : Cloud Speech-to-Text V2 can automatically
detect the sample rate, channel count, and format of your audio files,
without needing to provide that information in the request configuration.
Migrating from V1 to V2
Migration from the V1 API to the V2 API does not happen automatically. Minimal
implementation changes are required to take advantage of the feature set.
Migrating in the API
Similar to Cloud STT V1, to transcribe audio , you need to create a RecognitionConfig by selecting the language of your audio and the
recognition model of your choice:
Note: The difference between the V1 and V2 versions of the Cloud Speech-to-Text API in the
definition of RecognitionConfig message is the addition of the
AutoDetectDecodingConfig message, which
automatically detects the audio specifications.
Python
import os
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
PROJECT_ID = os . getenv ( "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" )
def quickstart_v2 ( audio_file : str ) - > cloud_speech . RecognizeResponse :
"""Transcribe an audio file.
Args:
audio_file (str): Path to the local audio file to be transcribed.
Returns:
cloud_speech.RecognizeResponse: The response from the recognize request, containing
the transcription results
"""
# Reads a file as bytes
with open ( audio_file , "rb" ) as f :
audio_content = f . read ()
# Instantiates a client
client = SpeechClient ()
config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
auto_decoding_config = cloud_speech . AutoDetectDecodingConfig (),
language_codes = [ "en-US" ],
model = "long" ,
)
request = cloud_speech . RecognizeRequest (
recognizer = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global/recognizers/_" ,
config = config ,
content = audio_content ,
)
# Transcribes the audio into text
response = client . recognize ( request = request )
for result in response . results :
print ( f "Transcript: { result . alternatives [ 0 ] . transcript } " )
return response
If needed, select a region in which you want to use the
Cloud Speech-to-Text API, and check the language and model availability in that region:
Python
import os
from google.api_core.client_options import ClientOptions
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
PROJECT_ID = os . getenv ( "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" )
def change_speech_v2_location (
audio_file : str , location : str
) - > cloud_speech . RecognizeResponse :
"""Transcribe an audio file in a specific region. It allows for specifying the location
to potentially reduce latency and meet data residency requirements.
Args:
audio_file (str): Path to the local audio file to be transcribed.
location (str): The region where the Speech API will be accessed.
E.g., "europe-west3"
Returns:
cloud_speech.RecognizeResponse: The full response object which includes the transcription results.
"""
# Reads a file as bytes
with open ( audio_file , "rb" ) as f :
audio_content = f . read ()
# Instantiates a client to a regionalized Speech endpoint.
client = SpeechClient (
client_options = ClientOptions (
api_endpoint = f " { location } -speech.googleapis.com" ,
)
)
config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
auto_decoding_config = cloud_speech . AutoDetectDecodingConfig (),
language_codes = [ "en-US" ],
model = "long" ,
)
request = cloud_speech . RecognizeRequest (
recognizer = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/ { location } /recognizers/_" ,
config = config ,
content = audio_content ,
)
# Transcribes the audio into text
response = client . recognize ( request = request )
for result in response . results :
print ( f "Transcript: { result . alternatives [ 0 ] . transcript } " )
return response
Optionally, create a recognizer resource if you need to
reuse a specific recognition configuration across many transcription requests:
Python
import os
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
PROJECT_ID = os . getenv ( "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" )
def create_recognizer ( recognizer_id : str ) - > cloud_speech . Recognizer :
"""Сreates a recognizer with an unique ID and default recognition configuration.
Args:
recognizer_id (str): The unique identifier for the recognizer to be created.
Returns:
cloud_speech.Recognizer: The created recognizer object with configuration.
"""
# Instantiates a client
client = SpeechClient ()
request = cloud_speech . CreateRecognizerRequest (
parent = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global" ,
recognizer_id = recognizer_id ,
recognizer = cloud_speech . Recognizer (
default_recognition_config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
language_codes = [ "en-US" ], model = "long"
),
),
)
# Sends the request to create a recognizer and waits for the operation to complete
operation = client . create_recognizer ( request = request )
recognizer = operation . result ()
print ( "Created Recognizer:" , recognizer . name )
return recognizer
There are other differences in the requests and responses in the new V2 API. For
more details, see the reference documentation .
Migrating in UI
To migrate through Speech Google Cloud console, follow these steps:
Go to Speech Google Cloud console .
Navigate to the Transcriptions Page.
Click New Transcription and select your audio in the Audio
configuration tab.
In the Transcription options tab, select V2 .
