Custom Speech-to-Text models help you fine-tune speech recognition
models to your specific needs. This service is designed to enhance the accuracy
and relevance of speech recognition service in diverse environments and use
cases, using your domain-specific audio and text data.
Accessible in both our Google Cloud console and API,
Custom Speech-to-Text models allow to train, evaluate and deploy a
dedicated speech model in a no-code integrated environment. For training you can
provide audio data only that are representative of your audio conditions,
without reference transcriptions as a training set. However, you need to provide
audio data and their reference transcriptions as part of your evaluation set.
Creating and using a custom Cloud Speech-to-Text model involves the following steps:
Prepare and upload training data in a Cloud Storage bucket.
Train a new custom model.
Deploy and manage your custom model using endpoints.
Use and evaluate your custom model in your application.
How does it work
You can use Custom Speech-to-Text models to augment a base
transcription model to improve transcription recognition. Some audio conditions,
including sirens, music, and excessive background noise can pose acoustic
challenges. Certain accents or unusual vocabulary, such product names can as
well.
Every Custom Speech-to-Text model uses pre-trained,
Conformer-based architecture as a base model trained with proprietary data of
commonly spoken language. During the training process, the base model is
fine-tuned by adapting a significant percentage of the original weights to
improve recognition of domain-specific vocabulary and audio conditions specific
to your application.
For the effective training of a Custom Speech-to-Text model,
you must provide:
Minimum 100 audio-hours of training data, either audio-only or audio with
the corresponding text transcript as ground-truth. This data is crucial for
the initial training phase, so the model comprehensively learns the nuances
of the speech patterns and vocabulary. For details, see Create a
ground-truth
dataset .
A separate dataset of at least 10 audio-hours of validation data, with
the corresponding text transcript as ground-truth. You can learn more
about the expected format and ground-truth conventions to be followed in
our data preparation
instructions .
Following a successful training, you can deploy a
Custom Speech-to-Text model in an endpoint with one click,
and use it directly through the Cloud Cloud Speech-to-Text V2 API for inference and
benchmarking.

Training and Deployment
Quota
For Custom Speech-to-Text model training, each Google Cloud
project should have enough default quota to run multiple training jobs
concurrently and is intended to meet the needs of most projects without
additional adjustments. However if you need to run a higher number of concurrent
training jobs or require more extensive labeling or compute resources, then
request additional quota.
For a Custom Speech-to-Text model serving an endpoint
deployment, each endpoint has a theoretical limit of 20 queries per second
(QPS) . If higher throughput is required, request
additional serving quota.
Pricing
Creating and using a Custom Speech-to-Text model involves
certain costs which are primarily based on the resources used during the
training and subsequent deployment of the model. Specifically, the
Custom Speech-to-Text model will incur the following costs in
a typical model lifecycle:
Training : You will be charged for the number of model-training hours.
This time is proportional to the amount of audio-hours in the training
dataset. As a rule, training takes a tenth of the number of audio-hours in
the dataset.
Deployment : You will be charged for each hour that a model is deployed
on an endpoint.
Inference : You will be charged for the number of streamed seconds of
audio for transcription, in alignment with the general Cloud Speech-to-Text
billing.
Understanding these costs is crucial for effective budgeting and resource
allocation. For more information, in the Custom Speech-to-Text models
section, see Cloud Cloud Speech-to-Text
pricing .
