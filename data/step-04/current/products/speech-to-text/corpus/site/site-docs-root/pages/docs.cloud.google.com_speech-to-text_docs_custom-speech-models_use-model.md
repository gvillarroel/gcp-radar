Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.

launch stage descriptions .
Use a trained Custom Speech-to-Text model in your production
application or benchmarking workflows. As soon as you deploy your model through
a dedicated endpoint, you automatically get programmatic access through a
recognizer object, which can be used directly through the Cloud Speech-to-Text V2
API or in the Google Cloud console.
Before you begin
Ensure you have signed up for a Google Cloud account, created a project, trained
a custom speech model, and deployed it using an endpoint.
Perform inference in V2
For a Custom Speech-to-Text model to be ready for use, the
state of the model in the Models tab should be Active , and the dedicated
endpoint in the Endpoints tab must be Deployed .
In our example, where a Google Cloud project ID is custom-models-walkthrough ,
the endpoint that corresponds to the
Custom Speech-to-Text model
quantum-computing-lectures-custom-model is
quantum-computing-lectures-custom-model-prod-endpoint . The region that it's
available is us-east1 , and the batch transcription request is the following:
from google.api_core import client_options
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
def quickstart_v2 (
project_id : str ,
audio_file : str ,
) - > cloud_speech . RecognizeResponse :
"""Transcribe an audio file."""
# Instantiates a client
client = SpeechClient (
client_options = client_options . ClientOptions (
api_endpoint = "us-east1-speech.googleapis.com"
)
)
# Reads a file as bytes
with open ( audio_file , "rb" ) as f :
content = f . read ()
config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
auto_decoding_config = cloud_speech . AutoDetectDecodingConfig (),
language_codes = [ "en-US" ],
model = "projects/custom-models-walkthrough/locations/us-east1/endpoints/quantum-computing-lectures-custom-model-prod-endpoint" ,
)
request = cloud_speech . RecognizeRequest (
recognizer = f "projects/custom-models-walkthrough/locations/us-east1/recognizers/_" ,
config = config ,
content = content ,
)
# Transcribes the audio into text
response = client . recognize ( request = request )
for result in response . results :
print ( f "Transcript: { result . alternatives [ 0 ] . transcript } " )
return response
Note: If you try to create a recognizer object in a different region than the
one that the endpoint is created in, the request will fail.
