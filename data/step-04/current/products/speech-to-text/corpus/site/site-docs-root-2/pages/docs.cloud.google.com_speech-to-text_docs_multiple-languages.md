This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This page describes how to set up a recognizer to automatically recognize the
language spoken in an audio file, from a preset list of potential languages.
In some situations, you don't know for certain what language your
audio recordings contain. For example, if you publish your service,
app, or product in a country with multiple official languages, you
can potentially receive audio input from users in a variety of
languages. This can make specifying a single language code for
transcription requests significantly more difficult.
Multiple language recognition
Cloud Speech-to-Text offers a way for you to specify a set of
languages that your audio data might contain. When creating a
Recognizer or sending a recognition request,
you can provide one or more languages that the audio data might
include in the language_codes field. In a request
with multiple languages, Cloud Speech-to-Text attempts to transcribe the audio using
the best-fit language from the list of alternates you provided.
Cloud Speech-to-Text then labels the transcription results with the
predicted language code.
This feature is ideal for apps that need to transcribe short
statements like voice commands or search. You can list up to three languages
for automatic language recognition.
Caution: Though you can specify up to three languages, constrain the language
list to the bare minimum needed as a best practice. The fewer language codes
you specify, the higher the likelihood that Cloud Speech-to-Text successfully
selects the correct one. Note: Specifying multiple languages is only available in the Cloud Speech-to-Text
global region and the us and eu multi-regions. Note: You can only use the alternative languages feature with the
long , short , and telephony models. For more information
about how to specify different models, see the
models documentation.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Speech-to-Text APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
Make sure that you have the following role or roles on the project:
Cloud Speech Administrator
Check for the roles
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Select the project.
In the Principal column, find all rows that identify you or a group that
you're included in. To learn which groups you're included in, contact your
administrator.
For all rows that specify or include you, check the Role column to see whether
the list of roles includes the required roles.
Grant the roles
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Select the project.
Click person_add Grant access .
In the New principals field, enter your user identifier.
This is typically the email address for a Google Account.
Click Select a role , then search for the role.
To grant additional roles, click add Add
another role and add each additional role.
Click Save .
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.

Client libraries can use
Application Default Credentials
to easily authenticate with Google APIs and send requests to those APIs. With
Application Default Credentials, you can test your application locally and
deploy it without changing the underlying code. For more information, see
Authenticate for using client libraries .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Also ensure you have installed the client library .
Enable language recognition in audio transcription requests
Here is an example of performing synchronous speech recognition on a local audio
file with multiple languages.
Python
import os
from typing import List
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
PROJECT_ID = os . getenv ( "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" )
def transcribe_multiple_languages_v2 (
audio_file : str ,
language_codes : List [ str ],
) - > cloud_speech . RecognizeResponse :
"""Transcribe an audio file using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API with support for multiple languages.
Args:
audio_file (str): Path to the local audio file to be transcribed.
Example: "resources/audio.wav"
language_codes (List[str]): A list of BCP-47 language codes to be used for transcription.
Example: ["en-US", "fr-FR"]
Returns:
cloud_speech.RecognizeResponse: The response from the Speech-to-Text API containing the
transcription results.
"""
client = SpeechClient ()
# Reads a file as bytes
with open ( audio_file , "rb" ) as f :
audio_content = f . read ()
config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
auto_decoding_config = cloud_speech . AutoDetectDecodingConfig (),
language_codes = language_codes ,
model = "latest_long" ,
)
request = cloud_speech . RecognizeRequest (
recognizer = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global/recognizers/_" ,
config = config ,
content = audio_content ,
)
# Transcribes the audio into text
response = client . recognize ( request = request )
# Prints the transcription results
for result in response . results :
print ( f "Transcript: { result . alternatives [ 0 ] . transcript } " )
return response

Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
