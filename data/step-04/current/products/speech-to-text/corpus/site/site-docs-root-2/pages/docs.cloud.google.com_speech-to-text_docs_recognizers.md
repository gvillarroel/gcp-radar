Recognizers
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Cloud Speech-to-Text API V2 supports a Google Cloud resource called
recognizers . Recognizers represent stored and reusable
recognition configuration. You can use them to logically group together
transcriptions or traffic for your application.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

Client libraries can use
Application Default Credentials
to easily authenticate with Google APIs and send requests to those APIs. With
Application Default Credentials, you can test your application locally and
deploy it without changing the underlying code. For more information, see
Authenticate for using client libraries .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Also ensure you have installed the client library .
Understand recognizers
Recognizers are configurable, reusable recognition configurations. Creating
recognizers with frequently used recognition configuration helps to simplify and
reduce the size of recognition requests.
The core element of a recognizer is its
default configuration . This is the
configuration for every recognition request that this recognizer performs. You
can override this default per request. Keep the default configuration for
features you need across requests for a given recognizer, while overriding
specific features for specific requests.
Reuse recognizers as often as possible. Creating one for each request
dramatically increases the latency of your application and consumes your
resource quotas . Create them infrequently during integration and
setup, then reuse them for recognition requests.
Create recognizers
Here is an example of creating a recognizer that can be used to send recognition requests:
Python
import os
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
PROJECT_ID = os . getenv ( "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" )
def create_recognizer ( recognizer_id : str ) - > cloud_speech . Recognizer :
"""Сreates a recognizer with an unique ID and default recognition configuration.
Args:
recognizer_id (str): The unique identifier for the recognizer to be created.
Returns:
cloud_speech.Recognizer: The created recognizer object with configuration.
"""
# Instantiates a client
client = SpeechClient ()
request = cloud_speech . CreateRecognizerRequest (
parent = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global" ,
recognizer_id = recognizer_id ,
recognizer = cloud_speech . Recognizer (
default_recognition_config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
language_codes = [ "en-US" ], model = "long"
),
),
)
# Sends the request to create a recognizer and waits for the operation to complete
operation = client . create_recognizer ( request = request )
recognizer = operation . result ()
print ( "Created Recognizer:" , recognizer . name )
return recognizer
Use an existing recognizer to send requests
Here is an example of sending multiple recognition requests using the same recognizer:
Python
import os
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
PROJECT_ID = os . getenv ( "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" )
def transcribe_reuse_recognizer (
audio_file : str ,
recognizer_id : str ,
) - > cloud_speech . RecognizeResponse :
"""Transcribe an audio file using an existing recognizer.
Args:
audio_file (str): Path to the local audio file to be transcribed.
Example: "resources/audio.wav"
recognizer_id (str): The ID of the existing recognizer to be used for transcription.
Returns:
cloud_speech.RecognizeResponse: The response containing the transcription results.
"""
# Instantiates a client
client = SpeechClient ()
# Reads a file as bytes
with open ( audio_file , "rb" ) as f :
audio_content = f . read ()
request = cloud_speech . RecognizeRequest (
recognizer = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global/recognizers/ { recognizer_id } " ,
content = audio_content ,
)
# Transcribes the audio into text
response = client . recognize ( request = request )
for result in response . results :
print ( f "Transcript: { result . alternatives [ 0 ] . transcript } " )
return response
Enable features in a recognizer
Recognizers can be used to enable various features in recognition, such as
automatic punctuation or
profanity filtering .
Here is an example of enabling automatic punctuation in a recognizer, which
enables automatic punctuation in the recognition request using this recognizer:
Note: Samples throughout the documentation repeatedly illustrate creating
recognizers. However, you should create them infrequently and reuse them often.
Python
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
from google.api_core.exceptions import NotFound
# Instantiates a client
client = SpeechClient ()
# TODO(developer): Update and un-comment below line
# PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
# recognizer_id = "id-recognizer"
recognizer_name = (
f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global/recognizers/ { recognizer_id } "
)
try :
# Use an existing recognizer
recognizer = client . get_recognizer ( name = recognizer_name )
print ( "Using existing Recognizer:" , recognizer . name )
except NotFound :
# Create a new recognizer
request = cloud_speech . CreateRecognizerRequest (
parent = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global" ,
recognizer_id = recognizer_id ,
recognizer = cloud_speech . Recognizer (
default_recognition_config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
auto_decoding_config = cloud_speech . AutoDetectDecodingConfig (),
language_codes = [ "en-US" ],
model = "latest_long" ,
features = cloud_speech . RecognitionFeatures (
enable_automatic_punctuation = True ,
),
),
),
)
operation = client . create_recognizer ( request = request )
recognizer = operation . result ()
print ( "Created Recognizer:" , recognizer . name )
# Reads a file as bytes
with open ( audio_file , "rb" ) as f :
audio_content = f . read ()
request = cloud_speech . RecognizeRequest (
recognizer = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global/recognizers/ { recognizer_id } " ,
content = audio_content ,
)
# Transcribes the audio into text
response = client . recognize ( request = request )
for result in response . results :
print ( f "Transcript: { result . alternatives [ 0 ] . transcript } " )
Override recognizer features in recognition requests
Here is an example of enabling multiple features in a recognizer, but disabling
automatic punctuation for this recognition request:
Python
import os
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
from google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2 import FieldMask
PROJECT_ID = os . getenv ( "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" )
def transcribe_override_recognizer (
audio_file : str ,
recognizer_id : str ,
) - > cloud_speech . RecognizeResponse :
"""Transcribe an audio file using an existing recognizer with overridden settings for the recognition request.
Args:
audio_file (str): Path to the local audio file to be transcribed.
Example: "resources/audio.wav"
recognizer_id (str): The unique ID of the recognizer to be used for transcription.
Returns:
cloud_speech.RecognizeResponse: The response containing the transcription results.
"""
# Instantiates a client
client = SpeechClient ()
request = cloud_speech . CreateRecognizerRequest (
parent = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global" ,
recognizer_id = recognizer_id ,
recognizer = cloud_speech . Recognizer (
default_recognition_config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
auto_decoding_config = cloud_speech . AutoDetectDecodingConfig (),
language_codes = [ "en-US" ],
model = "latest_long" ,
features = cloud_speech . RecognitionFeatures (
enable_automatic_punctuation = True ,
enable_word_time_offsets = True ,
),
),
),
)
operation = client . create_recognizer ( request = request )
recognizer = operation . result ()
print ( "Created Recognizer:" , recognizer . name )
# Reads a file as bytes
with open ( audio_file , "rb" ) as f :
audio_content = f . read ()
request = cloud_speech . RecognizeRequest (
recognizer = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global/recognizers/ { recognizer_id } " ,
config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
features = cloud_speech . RecognitionFeatures (
enable_word_time_offsets = False ,
),
),
config_mask = FieldMask ( paths = [ "features.enable_word_time_offsets" ]),
content = audio_content ,
)
# Transcribes the audio into text
response = client . recognize ( request = request )
for result in response . results :
print ( f "Transcript: { result . alternatives [ 0 ] . transcript } " )
return response
Send requests without recognizers
Recognizers are optional in recognition requests. To make a request without a
recognizer, use the recognizer resource ID _ in the location you are
making a request. Here is an example:
Python
import os
from google.cloud.speech_v2 import SpeechClient
from google.cloud.speech_v2.types import cloud_speech
PROJECT_ID = os . getenv ( "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" )
def quickstart_v2 ( audio_file : str ) - > cloud_speech . RecognizeResponse :
"""Transcribe an audio file.
Args:
audio_file (str): Path to the local audio file to be transcribed.
Returns:
cloud_speech.RecognizeResponse: The response from the recognize request, containing
the transcription results
"""
# Reads a file as bytes
with open ( audio_file , "rb" ) as f :
audio_content = f . read ()
# Instantiates a client
client = SpeechClient ()
config = cloud_speech . RecognitionConfig (
auto_decoding_config = cloud_speech . AutoDetectDecodingConfig (),
language_codes = [ "en-US" ],
model = "long" ,
)
request = cloud_speech . RecognizeRequest (
recognizer = f "projects/ { PROJECT_ID } /locations/global/recognizers/_" ,
config = config ,
content = audio_content ,
)
# Transcribes the audio into text
response = client . recognize ( request = request )
for result in response . results :
print ( f "Transcript: { result . alternatives [ 0 ] . transcript } " )
return response
