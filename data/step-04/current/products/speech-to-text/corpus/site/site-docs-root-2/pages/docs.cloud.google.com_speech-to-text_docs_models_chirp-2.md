Chirp 2: Enhanced multilingual accuracy
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Chirp 2 is the latest generation of Google's multilingual ASR-specific models,
designed to meet user needs based on feedback and experience. It improves on the
original Chirp model in accuracy and speed,
as well as expanding into key new features like word-level timestamps, model
adaptation, and speech translation.
Try Chirp 2 in the Google Cloud console

Model details
Chirp 2 is exclusively available within the Speech-to-Text API V2.
Model identifiers
You can utilize Chirp 2 just like any other model by specifying the appropriate
model identifier in your recognition request when using the API or the model
name while in the Google Cloud console.

Language availability for transcription
Chirp 2 supports transcription in StreamingRecognize , Recognize and
BatchRecognize recognition methods. Language support however differs depending
on the method used. Specifically BatchRecognize offers the most extensive
language support .
StreamingRecognize supports the following languages:

Language availability for translation
These are the supported languages for speech translation. Note that Chirp 2's
language support for translation is not symmetrical. This means that while we
may be able to translate from Language A to Language B, translation from
Language B to Language A might not be available. The following language pairs
are supported for Speech-Translation.

Feature support and limitations
Chirp 2 supports the following features:
Feature
Description
Automatic punctuation
Automatically generated by the model and can be optionally disabled.
Automatic capitalization
Automatically generated by the model and can be optionally disabled.
Speech adaptation (Biasing)
Provide hints to the model in the form of simple words or phrases to improve recognition accuracy for specific terms or proper nouns. Class tokens or custom classes are not supported.
Word-timings (Timestamps)
Automatically generated by the model and can be optionally enabled. It is possible that transcrption quality and speed will degrade slightly.
Profanity filter
Detect profane words and return only the first letter followed by asterisks in the transcript (for example, f***).
Language-agnostic audio transcription
The model automatically infers the spoken language in your audio file and transcribes in the most prevalent language.
Language-specific translation
The model automatically translates from the spoken language to the target language.
Forced normalization
If defined in the request body, the API will perform string replacements on specific terms or phrases, ensuring consistency in the transcription.
Word-level confidence scores
The API returns a value, but it isn't truly a confidence score. In the case of translation, confidence scores are not returned.
Denoiser and SNR-filtering
Denoise the audio before sending it to the model. Filter out audio segments if the SNR is lower than the specified threshold.
Chirp 2 does not support the following features:

Denoiser and SNR-filtering details
denoiser_audio=true can effectively help you reduce background music or noises
like rain and street traffic. Note that a denoiser cannot remove background
human voices.
You can set snr_threshold=X to control the minimum loudness of speech required
for transcription. This helps to filter out non-speech audio or background
noise, preventing unwanted text in your results. A higher snr_threshold means
the user needs to speak louder for the model to transcribe the utterances.
SNR-filtering can be utilized in real-time streaming use cases to avoid sending
unnecessary sounds to a model for transcription. A higher value for this setting
means that your speech volume must be louder relative to the background noise to
be sent to the transcription model.
The configuration of snr_threshold will interact with whether denoise_audio
is true or false . When denoise_audio=true , background noise is removed,
and speech becomes relatively clearer. The overall SNR of the audio goes up.
If your use case involves only the user's voice without others speaking, set
denoise_audio=true to increase the sensitivity of SNR-filtering, which can
filter out non-speech noise. If your use case involves people speaking in the
background and you want to avoid transcribing background speech, consider
setting denoise_audio=false and lowering the SNR threshold.
The following are recommended SNR threshold values. A reasonable snr_threshold
value can be set from 0 - 1000 . A value of 0 means don't filter anything,
and 1000 means filter everything. Fine-tune the value if recommended setting
does not work for you.

When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
