Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
An audio encoding refers to the manner in which audio data is stored and
transmitted. The page covers how such encodings work in relation to the
Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
For guidelines on choosing the best encoding for your application, see our best
practices guide .
Note: The information provided here is meant as a general overview. Digital
audio encoding is a complex topic, and you don't need to know the details to use
the Cloud Speech-to-Text API. Some of this background information may be useful for
understanding how the API works, and how audio should be formulated and
processed in your applications.
Audio formats versus encodings
An audio format is not equivalent to an audio encoding. For example, WAV audio
files define the format of the header of an audio file, but is not itself an
audio encoding. WAV files often (but not always) use a linear PCM encoding;
don't assume a WAV file has any particular encoding until you inspect its
header.
FLAC, however, is both a file format and an encoding, which sometimes
leads to some confusion. A FLAC file must contain the sample rate in the
header in order to be submitted to the Cloud Speech-to-Text API. FLAC is the only encoding
that requires audio data to include a header; all other audio encodings specify
headerless audio data. When we refer to FLAC within the Cloud Speech-to-Text API, we are
always referring to the codec. When we refer to a FLAC file format, we will use
the format "a FLAC file."
Note: You are not required to specify the encoding and sample rate for WAV or
FLAC files. If omitted, Cloud Speech-to-Text automatically determines the encoding
and sample rate for WAV or FLAC files based on the file header. If you specify
an encoding or sample rate value that does not match the value in the file
header, then Cloud Speech-to-Text returns an error.

Note: FLAC is both an audio codec and an audio file format. To transcribe audio
files using FLAC encoding, you must provide them in the FLAC file format,
which includes a header containing metadata.
Cloud Speech-to-Text supports WAV files with LINEAR16 or MULAW encoded audio.
For more information on Cloud Speech-to-Text audio codecs, consult the
AudioEncoding
reference documentation.
If you have a choice when encoding the source material, use a lossless encoding
such as FLAC or LINEAR16 for better speech recognition. For guidelines on
selecting the appropriate codec for your task, see Best
practices .
Why encode?
Audio is made up of waveforms, consisting of the interposition of waves of
different frequencies and amplitudes. To represent these waveforms within
digital media, the waveforms need to be sampled at rates that can (at least)
represent sounds of the highest frequency which you want to replicate, and they
also need to store enough bit depth to represent the proper amplitude
(loudness and softness) of the waveforms across the sound sample.
The ability of a sound processing device to recreate frequencies is known as its
frequency response and the ability of it to create proper loudness and
softness is known as its dynamic range . Together these terms are often
referred to as a sound device's fidelity . An encoding, in its simplest form,
is a means with which to reconstruct sound using these two basic principles, as
well as being able to store and transport such data efficiently.
Sampling rates
Sound exists as an analog waveform. A segment of digital audio approximates this
analog wave by sampling the amplitude of this analog wave at a fast enough rate
to mimic the wave's intrinsic frequencies. A digital audio segment's
sample rate specifies the number of samples to take from an audio's source
material (per second); a high sample rate increases the ability of digital audio
to faithfully represent high frequencies.
As a consequence of the Nyquist-Shannon
theorem ,
you generally need to sample more than twice the highest frequency of any sound
wave you want to capture digitally. To represent audio within the range of human
hearing (20-20000 Hz), for example, a digital audio format must sample at least
40000 times per second (which is part of the reason why CD audio uses a sample
rate of 44100 Hz).
Bit depths
Bit depth affects the dynamic range of a given audio sample. A higher bit depth
lets you represent more precise amplitudes. If you have lots of loud and soft
sounds within the same audio sample, you will need more bit depth to represent
those sounds correctly.
Higher bit depths also reduce the signal to noise ratio within audio samples. CD
musical audio is provided using 16 bits of bit depth. DVD Audio uses 24 bits of
bit depth, while most telephony equipment uses 8 bits of bit depth. (Certain
compression techniques can compensate for smaller bit depths, but they tend to
be lossy.)
Uncompressed audio
Most digital audio processing uses these two techniques (sampling rate and bit
depth) to store audio data in a straightforward manner. One of the most popular
digital audio techniques (popularized in use of the Compact Disc) is known as
Pulse Code Modulation
(PCM). Audio is sampled at set intervals, and the amplitude of the sampled wave
at that point is stored as a digital value using the sample's bit depth.
Linear PCM (which indicates that the amplitude response is linearly uniform
across the sample) is the standard used within CDs, and within the LINEAR16
encoding of the Cloud Speech-to-Text API. Both encodings produce an uncompressed stream of
bytes corresponding directly to audio data, and both standards contain 16 bits
of depth. Linear PCM uses a sample rate of 44,100 Hz within CDs, which is
appropriate for the recomposition of music; however a sample rate of 16000 Hz is
more appropriate for recomposing speech.
Linear PCM (LINEAR16) is an example of uncompressed audio in that the
digital data is stored exactly as the preceding standards imply. Reading a
one-channel stream of bytes encoded using Linear PCM, you could count off every
16 bits (2 bytes), for example, to get another amplitude value of the waveform.
Almost all devices can manipulate such digital data natively—you can even crop
Linear PCM audio files using a text editor—but uncompressed audio is not the
most efficient way to transport or store digital audio. For that reason, most
audio uses digital compressions techniques.
Compressed audio
Like all data, audio data is often compressed to make it easier to store and to
transport. Compression within audio encoding may be either lossless or
lossy . Lossless compression can be unpacked to restore the digital data to its
original form. Lossy compression necessarily removes some such information
during compression and decompression, and is parameterized to indicate how much
tolerance to give to the compression technique to remove data.
Lossless compression
Lossless compression compresses digital audio data using complex rearrangements
of the stored data, but results in no degradation in quality of the original
digital sample. With lossless compression, when unpacking the data into its
original digital form, no information will be lost.
So why do lossless compression techniques sometimes have optimization
parameters? These parameters often trade file size for decompression time. For
example, FLAC uses a compression level parameter from 0 (fastest) to 8 (smallest
file size). Higher level FLAC compression won't lose any information in
comparison to lower level compression. Instead, the compression algorithm will
just need to expend more computational energy when constructing or
deconstructing original digital audio.
The Cloud Speech-to-Text API supports two lossless encodings: FLAC and LINEAR16.
Technically, LINEAR16 isn't "lossless compression" because no compression is
involved in the first place. If file size or data transmission is important to
you, use FLAC.
Lossy compression
Lossy compression, on the other hand, compresses audio data by eliminating or
reducing certain types of information during the construction of the compressed
data. The Cloud Speech-to-Text API supports several lossy formats, though you should avoid
them if you have control over the audio, because data loss may affect
recognition accuracy.
The popular MP3 codec is an example of a lossy encoding technique. All MP3
compression techniques remove audio from outside a normal human's audio range,
and adjust the amount of compression by adjusting the MP3 codec's effective
bit rate , or amount of bits per second to store the audio date.
For example, a stereo CD using Linear PCM of 16 bits has an effective bit rate
of:
44100 * 2 channels * 16 bits = 1411200 bits per second (bps) = 1411 kbps
MP3 compression removes such digital data using bit rates such as 320 kbps, 128
kbps, or 96 kbps, for example, with resulting degradation in audio quality. MP3
also supports variable bit rates, which can compress the audio further. Both
techniques lose information and can affect quality. Most people can tell the
difference between 96 kbps or 128 kbps encoded MP3 music, for example.
Other forms of compression will parameterize some other constraint.
MULAW (also called μ-law
or uLaw) is an 8 bit PCM encoding, where the sample's amplitude is modulated
logarithmically rather than linearly. As a result, uLaw reduces the effective
dynamic range of the audio thus compressed. Though uLaw was introduced to
specifically optimize encoding of speech in contrast to other types of audio, 16
bit LINEAR16 (uncompressed PCM) is still far superior to 8 bit uLaw compressed
audio.
AMR and
AMR_WB modulate
the encoded audio sample by introducing a variable bit rate on the source audio
sample.
Although the Cloud Speech-to-Text API supports several lossy formats, you should avoid them
if you have control over the source audio. Although the removal of such data
through lossy compression may not noticeably affect audio as heard by the human
ear, loss of such data to a speech recognition engine may significantly degrade
accuracy.
