Chirp 3 is the latest generation of Google's multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)-specific
generative models, designed to meet user needs based on feedback and experience. Chirp 3 provides enhanced accuracy and speed beyond previous Chirp models and provides diarization and automatic language detection.
Model details
Chirp 3: Transcription, is exclusively available within the Speech-to-Text API V2.
Model identifiers
You can use Chirp 3: Transcription just like any other model by specifying the appropriate model identifier in your recognition request when using the API or the model name while in the Google Cloud console. Specify the appropriate identifier in your recognition.

Perform a language-restricted transcription
Chirp 3 can automatically identify and transcribe the dominant language in an audio file. You can also condition it on specific locales you expect, for example: ["en-US", "fr-FR"] , which would focus the model's resources on the most probable languages for more reliable results, as demonstrated in the code example:
Python

Improve accuracy with model adaptation
Chirp 3 can improve transcription accuracy for your specific audio using model adaptation. This lets you to provide a list of specific words and phrases, increasing the likelihood that the model will recognize them. It's especially useful for domain-specific terms, proper nouns, or unique vocabulary.
Note: chirp_3 supports a dictionary of up to 1,000 phrases for adaptation. We recommend using as few entries as possible to prevent degradation on non-adaptation terms.

Enable denoiser
Chirp 3 can enhance audio quality by reducing background noise. You can improve results from noisy environments by enabling the built-in denoiser.
Setting denoiser_audio=true can effectively help you reduce background music or noises
like rain and street traffic.
Note: The denoiser can't remove background human voices.

Adjust endpointing sensitivity
The Cloud Speech-to-Text API lets you control the trade-off between latency and
accuracy for streaming and real-time applications for Chirp 3. By default, the
recognition model waits for a brief period of silence after speech is detected
to ensure that a user has finished a complete sentence or phrase. This helps to
ensure the highest accuracy but introduces a small delay in the final response.
endpointing_sensitivity can be adjusted for time-sensitive applications like
voice commands or voice bots to finalize results more quickly.
Note: If the user pauses briefly while speaking, increasing the bot's
sensitivity to minimize latency might result in the system "cutting off" a user.
Sensitivity levels
Endpointing sensitivity can be configured to one of the following levels
based on the use case:
ENDPOINTING_SENSITIVITY_STANDARD (default): The standard setting that
balances latency and accuracy. It's optimized for most use cases, including
long-form dictation and natural conversation. The model waits to help ensure the
utterance is complete before finalizing the result.
ENDPOINTING_SENSITIVITY_SHORT : Optimized for short utterances, such as
single sentences or commands, such as "Remind me to call the dentist tomorrow".
This setting reduces the wait time after speech is detected, which provides a
faster response than the standard setting while maintaining reasonable
sentence-level accuracy.
ENDPOINTING_SENSITIVITY_SUPERSHORT : Optimized for very short commands or
single words, such as "Yes", "No", or "Stop". This setting offers the lowest
latency and finalizes the result immediately upon detecting the end of speech.
It is recommended only for applications where speed is critical and utterances
are expected to be brief.
