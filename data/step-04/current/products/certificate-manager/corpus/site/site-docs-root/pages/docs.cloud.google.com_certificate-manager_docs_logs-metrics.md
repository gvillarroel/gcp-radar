Logs and metrics
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how Certificate Manager logs various types of
information about its operation and how to view that information.
Logs
To view Certificate Manager logs, use the
Logs Explorer in the Google Cloud console.
Certificate Manager provides Google Cloud logs described in
Google Cloud logs .
Certificate Manager uses Cloud Logging to capture and
store logs. Certificate Manager logging is always enabled and
only captures a minimal amount of information specifically related to
certificate expiration. The Certificate Manager monitored resource type
is certificatemanager.googleapis.com/Project .
You can also capture and retrieve Certificate Manager logs using
Cloud Logging. See the documentation for
Cloud Logging client libraries
for information on how to configure this logging mechanism.
Configure log alerts
You can configure alerts for events that Certificate Manager writes to
Cloud Logging, such as certificate expiration. For instructions, see
Configure log-based alerts .
For example, to configure an alert for certificates that have expired, use the following as the alert query:
logName = "projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/certificatemanager.googleapis.com%2Fcertificates_expiry" AND jsonPayload.state = "EXPIRED"
If you want to configure an alert for certificates that are close to expiration, use the following as the alert query:
logName = "projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/certificatemanager.googleapis.com%2Fcertificates_expiry" AND jsonPayload.state = "CLOSE_TO_EXPIRY"
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of the target Google Cloud project.
For Google-managed certificates CLOSE_TO_EXPIRY logs are generated daily, starting 5-10 days before
expiration, depending on the certificate's lifetime and renewal process. For self-managed
certificates too, CLOSE_TO_EXPIRY logs are generated daily, starting 10 days before expiration.
Metrics
This section lists the metrics supported by Certificate Manager.
To view Certificate Manager metrics, use the
Metrics Explorer in the
Google Cloud console.
Standard metrics
Certificate Manager writes the following standard
Cloud Monitoring API metrics:
Metric
Description
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_count
Kind: Delta
Type: INT64
Unit: 1
Cumulative count of completed requests. The following labels apply:
protocol indicates the request's protocol, such as http or grpc .
response_code is the HTTP (or equivalent for gRPC) response code for HTTP/gRPC requests.
See code list .
response_code_class is the class (or equivalent for gRPC) of the response code, such as `200` or `400`.
grpc_status_code is the gRPC response code or its HTTP equivalent.
See code list .
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_latencies
Kind: Delta
Type: DISTRIBUTION
Unit: Seconds
Distribution of latencies for non-streaming requests.
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_sizes
Kind: Delta
Type: DISTRIBUTION
Unit: Byte
Distribution of request sizes. Request size is recorded when a request completes.
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/response_sizes
Kind: Delta
Type: DISTRIBUTION
Unit: Byte
Distribution of response sizes. Response size is recorded when a request completes.
Custom metrics
Additionally, Certificate Manager writes the following custom
metrics using the Cloud Monitoring API:
Metric
Description
certificatemanager.googleapis.com/project/certificates
Kind: GAUGE
Type: INT64
Unit: 1
Number of certificates provisioned within the target Google Cloud project. The following labels apply:
type indicates whether the certificate is Google-managed ( MANAGED ) or self-managed ( SELF_MANAGED ).
scope indicates whether the certificate scope is Cloud Load Balancing ( DEFAULT ) or Media CDN ( EDGE_CACHE ).
is_active indicates whether the certificate is active. Valid values are true and false .
certificatemanager.googleapis.com/map/entries
Kind: GAUGE
Type: INT64
Unit: 1
Number of certificate map entries provisioned within the target Google Cloud project. The following labels apply:
is_primary indicates whether the certificate map entry is the primary entry in the certificate map. Valid values are true and false .
