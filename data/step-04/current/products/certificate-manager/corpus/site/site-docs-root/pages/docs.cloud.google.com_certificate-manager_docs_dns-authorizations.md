Manage DNS authorizations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
DNS authorizations let you prove ownership of domains for Google-managed
certificates . When creating a Google-managed
certificate, one or more DNS authorizations can be specified to use for
provisioning and renewal.
This page describes how to create and manage DNS authorizations for use
with Google-managed certificates.
For more information, see
Domain authorizations .
Note: The Google Cloud CLI instructions on this page assume that you are using
Cloud Shell or another environment with bash installed. For
more information about the gcloud CLI commands used on this page, see
the Certificate Manager CLI
reference .
Create a DNS authorization
Roles required for this task
To perform this task, you must have one of the following IAM roles on the target Google Cloud project.
Certificate Manager Editor role ( roles/certificatemanager.editor )
Certificate Manager Owner role ( roles/certificatemanager.owner )
For more information, see Roles and permissions .
Note: If you aren't assigned the required roles, contact the
IAM Administrator who has the Project IAM Admin role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin ) to grant you the missing roles.
A DNS authorization only covers a single domain name. You must create a separate
DNS authorization for each domain name that you want to use with the target
certificate.
If you're creating a
DNS authorization for a wildcard certificate, such as *.myorg.example.com ,
configure the DNS authorization for the parent domain—for example,
myorg.example.com .
To independently manage certificates across multiple projects, you can use
PER_PROJECT_RECORD DNS authorization.
Certificate Manager can handle issuing and managing certificates
for each project independently within Google Cloud. DNS authorizations and
certificates that you use within a project are self-contained and don't interact
with those in other projects.
Note: Due to ongoing IETF standardization efforts, Google uses a custom
implementation of account-based DNS authorization for per-project DNS
authorizations.
Console
You can create a DNS authorization or attach an existing DNS
authorization when creating a certificate. For more information, see
Create a Google-managed certificate referencing the DNS authorization .
gcloud
Depending on your requirements, you can create any of these two types of DNS
authorizations: FIXED_RECORD or PER_PROJECT_RECORD . For more
information, see DNS authorization .
FIXED_RECORD DNS authorization
To create a FIXED_RECORD DNS authorization, use the following gcloud certificate-manager
dns-authorizations create command :
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations create AUTHORIZATION_NAME \
--domain=" DOMAIN_NAME " \
--type=[FIXED_RECORD] \
[--location=" LOCATION "]
Replace the following:
AUTHORIZATION_NAME : the name of the DNS authorization.
DOMAIN_NAME : the name of the target domain for which you are creating this DNS authorization. The domain name must be a fully qualified domain name, such as myorg.example.com .
LOCATION : the target Google Cloud location where you create the DNS authorization.
After creating the FIXED_RECORD DNS authorization, verify it with the
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations describe command :
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations describe AUTHORIZATION_NAME
The output is similar to the following. In the output, find the
dnsResourceRecord line and get the CNAME record ( data , name , and type )
to add to your DNS
configuration .
createTime: '2022-01-14T13:35:00.258409106Z'
dnsResourceRecord:
data: 0e40fc77-a37d-4eb8-8fe1-eea2e18d12d9.4.authorize.certificatemanager.goog.
name: _acme-challenge.myorg.example.com.
type: CNAME
domain: myorg.example.com
name: projects/myProject/locations/global/dnsAuthorizations/myAuthorization
updateTime: '2022-01-14T13:35:01.571086137Z'
PER_PROJECT_RECORD DNS authorization
To create a PER_PROJECT_RECORD DNS authorization, use the following
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations create command :
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations create AUTHORIZATION_NAME \
--domain=" DOMAIN_NAME " \
--type=PER_PROJECT_RECORD \
[--location=" LOCATION "]
Replace the following:
AUTHORIZATION_NAME : the name of the DNS authorization.
DOMAIN_NAME : the name of the target domain for which you are creating this DNS authorization. The domain name must be a fully qualified domain name, such as myorg.example.com .
LOCATION : the target Google Cloud location where you create the DNS authorization.
After creating the PER_PROJECT_RECORD DNS authorization, verify it with
the gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations describe command :
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations describe AUTHORIZATION_NAME
The output is similar to the following. In the output, find the
dnsResourceRecord section. Locate the CNAME record and add the record's
details ( data , name , and type ) to your DNS configuration .
createTime: '2022-01-14T13:35:00.258409106Z'
dnsResourceRecord:
data: 0e40fc77-a37d-4eb8-8fe1-eea2e18d12d9.4.authorize.certificatemanager.goog.
name: _acme-challenge_ujmmovf2vn55tgye.myorg.example.com
type: CNAME
domain: myorg.example.com
name: projects/myProject/locations/global/dnsAuthorizations/myAuthorization
updateTime: '2022-01-14T13:35:01.571086137Z'
Note: For PER_PROJECT_RECORD DNS authorization,
Certificate Manager supports only the certificates issued by
Google Trust Services . Certificates issued by other
authorities, such as Let's Encrypt CA, aren't supported.
Terraform
To create a DNS authorization, you can use a
google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization resource .
resource "google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization" "default" {
name = "${local.name}-dnsauth-${random_id.tf_prefix.hex}"
description = "The default dns auth"
domain = local.domain
labels = {
"terraform" : true
}
}
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see
Basic Terraform commands .
API
To create a DNS authorization, make a POST request to the dnsAuthorizations.create method:
POST /v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /dnsAuthorizations?dns_authorization_id= AUTHORIZATION_NAME
{
"domain": " DOMAIN_NAME ",
"type": "PER_PROJECT_RECORD" //optional
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project.
LOCATION : the target Google Cloud location where you create the DNS authorization. For the global location,
use global .
AUTHORIZATION_NAME : the name of the DNS authorization.
DOMAIN_NAME : the name of the target domain for which you are creating this DNS authorization.
The domain name must be a fully qualified domain name, such as myorg.example.com .
Add the CNAME record to your DNS configuration
If you're using a third-party DNS solution to manage your DNS, refer to its
documentation to add the CNAME record to the DNS configuration. If you're using
Google Cloud to manage your DNS, complete the steps in this section.
Important: You must ensure that your CNAME is the only resource
record for a specific DNS name. Although some DNS providers allow you to
configure both CNAME and TXT resource records for the
same DNS name, this type of configuration is incorrect and can lead to
conflicts, preventing reliable certificate issuance or renewal. If such a
conflict occurs, then you can either delete your TXT records or use
the per-project DNS authorization method.
Console
To create a record set, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the DNS zones page.
Go to Cloud DNS zones
Click the name of the DNS zone where you want to add the record.
On the Zone details page, click Add standard .
On the Create record set page, in the DNS name field, enter
the subdomain of the DNS zone.
When entering the subdomain name, make sure that the subdomain name,
including the greyed-out text
displayed in the DNS name field, matches the full value of the
dnsResourceRecord.name field as displayed in the output of the
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations describe command .
See the following examples:
If the dnsResourceRecord.name field value is
_acme-challenge.myorg.example.com. , and the greyed-out text in the
DNS name field is .example.com. , then enter
_acme-challenge.myorg .
If the dnsResourceRecord.name field value is
_acme-challenge.myorg.example.com. , and the greyed-out text in the
DNS name field is .myorg.example.com. , then enter
_acme-challenge .
If the value of the dnsResourceRecord.name field is
_acme-challenge_ujmmovf2vn55tgye.myorg.example.com. , and the
greyed-out text in the DNS name field is .myorg.example.com. ,
then enter _acme-challenge_ujmmovf2vn55tgye .
Note: Adding the @ symbol in this field causes the record to fail.
In the Resource record type field, select CNAME .
In the TTL field, enter a positive numeric value for the resource record's
time to live, which is the amount of time that it can be cached.
From the TTL unit list, select the unit of time—for example,
30 minutes .
In the Canonical name field, enter the full value of the
dnsResourceRecord.data field as displayed in the output of the gcloud
certificate-manager dns-authorizations describe command .
To enter additional information, click Add item .
Click Create .
gcloud
When you create a DNS authorization, the gcloud CLI command
returns the corresponding CNAME record. To add the CNAME record to your DNS
configuration in the DNS zone of the target domain, follow these steps:
Initiate the DNS record transaction:
gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone=" DNS_ZONE_NAME "
Replace DNS_ZONE_NAME with the name of the target DNS
zone.
Add the CNAME record to the target DNS zone:
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add CNAME_RECORD \
--name=" VALIDATION_SUBDOMAIN_NAME . DOMAIN_NAME ." \
--ttl="30" \
--type="CNAME" \
--zone=" DNS_ZONE_NAME "
Replace the following:
CNAME_RECORD : the full data value of the CNAME
record returned by the Google Cloud CLI command that created the
corresponding DNS authorization.
VALIDATION_SUBDOMAIN_NAME : the prefix subdomain
of the DNS zone, such as _acme-challenge . You can copy the name
from the gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations describe
command log, as described in Create a DNS authorization .
DOMAIN_NAME : the name of the target domain.The domain name must be a fully qualified domain name, such as myorg.example.com . You must also include the trailing period
after the target domain name.
DNS_ZONE_NAME : the name of the target DNS zone.
For more information about the difference between
FIXED_RECORD and PER_PROJECT_RECORD DNS
authorizations, see the following
examples. The only difference between the two examples is the value
of the --name flag.
FIXED_RECORD DNS authorization
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add 0e40fc77-a37d-4eb8-8fe1-eea2e18d12d9.4.authorize.certificatemanager.goog. \
--name="_acme-challenge.myorg.example.com." \
--ttl="30" \
--type="CNAME" \
--zone="myorg-example-com"
PER_PROJECT_RECORD DNS authorization
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add 0e40fc77-a37d-4eb8-8fe1-eea2e18d12d9.4.authorize.certificatemanager.goog. \
--name="_acme-challenge_ujmmovf2vn55tgye.myorg.example.com." \
--ttl="30" \
--type="CNAME" \
--zone="myorg-example-com"
Run the DNS record transaction to save your changes:
gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone=" DNS_ZONE_NAME "
Replace DNS_ZONE_NAME with the name of the target DNS
zone.
Terraform
To add the CNAME record to your DNS configuration, you can use a
google_dns_record_set resource .
resource "google_dns_record_set" "cname" {
name = google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization.default.dns_resource_record[0].name
managed_zone = google_dns_managed_zone.default.name
type = google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization.default.dns_resource_record[0].type
ttl = 300
rrdatas = [google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization.default.dns_resource_record[0].data]
}
