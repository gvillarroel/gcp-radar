Public CA
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can use the Public Certificate Authority to
provision and deploy widely trusted X.509 certificates after validating that the certificate requester
controls the domains. Public CA lets you directly and programmatically
request publicly trusted TLS certificates that are already in the root of trust stores used by
major browsers, operating systems, and applications. You can use these TLS certificates to
authenticate and encrypt internet traffic.
Public CA lets you manage high volume use cases that other CAs
have been unable to support. If you are a Google Cloud customer, you can
request TLS certificates for your domains directly from Public CA.
Most certificate-related problems are due to human error or oversight, so we
recommend automating certificate lifecycles. Public CA uses the
Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
protocol for the automated provisioning, renewal, and revocation of
certificates. Automated certificate management reduces downtime that expired
certificates can cause and minimizes operational costs.
Public CA provisions TLS certificates for several Google Cloud
services, such as App Engine , Cloud Shell ,
Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Load Balancing .
Who should use Public CA
You can use Public CA for the following reasons:
If you are looking for a TLS provider with high ubiquity, scalability,
security, and reliability.
If you want most, if not all, TLS certificates for your infrastructure,
including on-premises workloads and cross-cloud provider setups, from a
single cloud provider.
If you need control and flexibility over the TLS certificate management to
customize it to your infrastructure requirements.
If you want to automate the TLS certificate management but cannot use
managed certificates in Google Cloud services, such as GKE
or Cloud Load Balancing .
We recommend that you use publicly trusted certificates only when your business requirements
do not allow another option. Given the historical cost and complexity of maintaining public
key infrastructure (PKI) hierarchies, many enterprises use public PKI
hierarchies even when a private hierarchy makes more sense.
Maintaining public and private hierarchies has become much simpler with multiple
Google Cloud offerings. We recommend that you carefully choose the right type of
PKI for your use case.
For non-public certificate requirements, Google Cloud offers two easy-to-manage
solutions:
Anthos Service Mesh : Cloud Service Mesh includes
fully automated mTLS certificate provisioning for workloads running in
GKE Enterprise using Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority (Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority) .
Certificate Authority Service :
Certificate Authority Service lets you deploy,
manage, and secure custom private CAs efficiently without managing
infrastructure.
Benefits of Public CA
Public CA provides the following benefits:
Automation : As internet browsers aim for fully encrypted traffic and
the reduction of certificate validity periods, there is a risk of using
expired TLS certificates. Certificate expiration can lead to website errors,
and can cause service outages. Public CA avoids the
problem of certificate expiration by letting you set up your HTTPS server to
automatically obtain and renew the necessary TLS certificates from our ACME
endpoint.
Compliance : Public CA undergoes regular, rigorous independent
audits of security, privacy, and compliance controls. The Webtrust
seals granted as a result of these annual audits
demonstrate Public CA's conformity with all relevant
industry standards.
Security : The architecture and operations of Public CA are
designed to the highest level of security standards and regularly runs
independent assessments to confirm the security of the underlying
infrastructure. Public CA either meets or exceeds all the
controls, operational practices, and security measures mentioned in the
Google Security whitepaper .
Public CA's focus on security extends to features such as
multi-perspective domain validation. Public CA's infrastructure is
globally distributed. Therefore, Public CA requires a high degree
of agreement across geographically diverse perspectives, which provides
protection against Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking
and Domain Name Server (DNS) hijacking attacks.
Reliability : The use of Google's proven technical infrastructure makes
Public CA a highly available and scalable service.
Ubiquity: The strong browser ubiquity of Google Trust
Services helps ensure that services using
certificates that Public CA issues work on the widest possible
range of devices and operating systems.
Streamlined TLS solutions for hybrid setups : Public CA lets
you build a custom TLS certificate solution that uses the same CA for
diverse scenarios and use cases. Public CA effectively serves
the use cases where workloads are running on-premises or in a cross-cloud
provider environment.
Scale : Certificates have often been costly to obtain and difficult to
provision and maintain. By offering access to large volumes of certificates,
Public CA lets you utilize and manage certificates in ways that
were previously considered impractical.
Use Public CA with Certificate Manager
To use the Public CA feature of Certificate Manager, you must be familiar
with the following concepts:
ACME client . An Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) client is a certificate
management client that uses the ACME protocol .
Your ACME client must support external account binding (EAB) to work with Public CA.
External account binding (EAB) . You must bind each ACME account you are using with Certificate Manager
Public CA to the target Google Cloud project using external account binding. To do this, you must register each
ACME account using a secret linked to its corresponding Google Cloud project. For more information, see External account
binding .
Public CA challenges
When you use Public CA to request a certificate,
Certificate Manager asks you to prove your control over the domains
listed in that certificate. You can prove domain control by solving challenges.
Public CA authorizes the domain names after you prove your
control of the target domains.
After you obtain the required authorizations, you can request certificates that are valid only for a
specific duration. After this duration, you must revalidate the domain name
by solving one of the three challenge types to continue requesting certificates.
Challenge types
Public CA supports the following types of challenges:
HTTP challenge . This challenge involves creating a file at a well-known
location on an HTTP server (port 80) for Public CA to retrieve
and verify. For more information, see HTTP challenge .
TLS-Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) challenge . Requires a
server to provide a specific certificate during a TLS negotiation on port 443
to prove control over a domain. For more information, see
ACME TLS-ALPN challenge extension .
DNS challenge . Requires adding a specific DNS record at
a defined location to prove control over a domain.
For more information, see DNS challenge .
If you use the HTTP challenge or the TLS-ALPN challenge to validate a
domain name, the client can only request the validated domain
names to be included in a certificate. If you use the DNS challenge, the
client can also request subdomains of that domain name to be included in a
certificate.
For example, if you validate *.myorg.example.com using the DNS challenge, then
subdomain1.myorg.example.com and subdomain2.myorg.example.com are automatically covered
by the wildcard certificate. However, if you validate myorg.example.com using an HTTP or
TLS-ALPN challenge, the client can only request to include myorg.example.com in
the certificate and you cannot validate *.myorg.example.com using the non-DNS challenges.
Challenge solution logic
The Public CA challenge logic is as follows:
Public CA provides a random token.
The client makes the token available at a well-defined location. The
location depends on the challenge.
The client indicates to Public CA that it has prepared the
challenge.
Public CA checks if the token present at the expected
location matches the expected value.
The domain name is authorized after this process is completed. The client can
request a certificate with that domain name in it. You need to solve only one
challenge per domain name.
