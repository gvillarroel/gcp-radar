Domain authorization types for Google-managed certificates
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how domain authorization works with Google-managed
certificates. The page compares load balancer authorization to DNS authorization
and explains how Certificate Manager verifies domain ownership
using each method.
Certificate Manager lets you prove ownership of domains for which
you want to issue Google-managed certificates in one of the following ways:
Load balancer authorization : deploy the certificate directly to a
supported load balancer without creating a DNS record. This method is faster
to configure, but it doesn't support wildcard certificates or regional
certificates. Additionally, Certificate Manager can only
provision certificates after the load balancer has been fully set up and is
serving network traffic.
DNS authorization : deploy the certificate directly to a supported load
balancer after creating dedicated DNS records for verification of domain
ownership. Using this method, Certificate Manager can
provision certificates in advance, before the target proxy is ready to serve
network traffic.
Domain authorization doesn't apply to Google-managed certificates issued by
Certificate Authority Service. For more information about such certificates, see Deploy a
global Google-managed certificate with Certificate Authority Service .
Load balancer authorization
Load balancer authorization is the simplest method for issuing a Google-managed
certificate. This method minimizes changes to your DNS configuration, but only
provisions the TLS (SSL) certificate after the load balancer configuration is
complete. This method also makes load balancer authorization ideal for new
environments with no existing production traffic.
To create Google-managed certificates with load balancer authorization, your
deployment must meet the following requirements:
The Google-managed certificate must be accessible on port 443 from all IP
addresses serving the target domain; otherwise, provisioning fails. For
example, if you have separate load balancers for IPv4 and IPv6, you must
assign the same Google-managed certificate to each of them.
You must explicitly specify the IP addresses of your load balancers in your
DNS configuration, which prevents multi-perspective domain validation
failures .
Intermediate layers, such as CDN, can cause unpredictable behavior.
The target domain must be openly resolvable from the Internet. Split-horizon
or DNS firewall environments can interfere with certificate provisioning.
DNS authorization
DNS authorization lets you verify domain ownership and provision Google-managed
certificates even before your production environment is fully set up. This is
particularly useful when you're migrating certificates to Google Cloud.
Certificate Manager verifies domain ownership through DNS
records. Each DNS authorization stores information about a DNS record, and
covers a single domain and its wildcard (for example, both myorg.example.com
and *.myorg.example.com ). A wildcard covers only the first subdomain level, and
doesn't cover deeper subdomain levels. For example, *.myorg.example.com doesn't cover
sub.subdomain.myorg.example.com .
When creating a Google-managed certificate, you can use one or more DNS
authorizations to provision and renew certificates. If you have
multiple certificates for a single domain, then you can use the same DNS
authorization for all the certificates. However, your DNS authorizations must cover all
domains listed in the certificate; if they don't, creating and renewing
certificates will fail.
To set up DNS authorization, you must add a CNAME record to your DNS
configuration. You can use this record to validate the subdomain under your
target domain. The CNAME record points to a special Google Cloud domain
that Certificate Manager uses to verify your domain ownership.
When you create a DNS authorization, Certificate Manager returns
this CNAME record and verifies your ownership.
Remember, the CNAME record also grants Certificate Manager
the permission to provision and renew certificates for the target domain within your
Google Cloud project. To revoke these permissions, remove the CNAME record
from your DNS configuration.
Note: The validation sub-domain must be openly resolvable from the internet.
Split-horizon or DNS firewall environments can interfere with certificate
provisioning.
Per-project DNS authorization
Per-project DNS authorization lets you manage certificates independently within
each Google Cloud project. Using per-project DNS authorization,
Certificate Manager can issue and handle certificates for each
project separately. The DNS authorizations and certificates used within a
project are self-contained and don't interact with artifacts from other
projects.
To activate per-project DNS authorization, choose the PER_PROJECT_RECORD
option when creating a DNS authorization. You will then receive a unique CNAME
record that includes both a subdomain and a target specific to that project.
You shoud add this CNAME record to the DNS zone of the relevant domain.
Note: Due to ongoing IETF standardization efforts for account-based DNS
authorization, Google uses a custom implementation of account-based DNS
authorization for per-project DNS authorizations.
Compare load balancer authorization with DNS authorization
Certificate Manager lets you prove ownership of domains for which
you want to issue Google-managed certificates as described in the following
table.
Load balancer authorization
DNS authorization
Setup complexity
Load balancer authorization doesn't require additional configuration steps or changes to your DNS
configuration.
Requires you to create a DNS authorization and add its corresponding
CNAME record to your DNS configuration.
Network security
The load balancer must be fully accessible from the internet on port
443, including the DNS configuration for all domains served by the
certificate. Load balancer authorization doesn't work with other configurations.
Works with highly complex configurations, such as ports other than
443 and CDN layers in front of the target proxy.
Provisioning speed
You can provision certificates only after the load balancer is
fully set up and serving network traffic.
You can provision certificates in advance, before the target proxy is
ready to serve network traffic.
