Manage certificates
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to use Certificate Manager to create
and manage Transport Layer Security (TLS) (formerly SSL ) certificates.
For more information, see Supported TLS certificates .
Note: The Google Cloud CLI instructions on this page assume that you are using
Cloud Shell or another environment with bash installed. For
more information about the gcloud CLI commands used on this page, see
the Certificate Manager CLI
reference .
Create a Google-managed certificate
Certificate Manager lets you create Google-managed certificates
in the following ways:
Google-managed certificates with load balancer authorization (global)
Google-managed certificates with DNS authorization (global, regional, and
cross-region)
Google-managed certificates with
Certificate Authority Service (CA Service) (global, regional, and cross-region)
Load balancer authorization
Load balancer authorization lets you obtain a Google-managed certificate for
your domain when traffic is served by the load balancer. This method doesn't
require any additional DNS records for certificate provisioning. You can use
load balancer authorizations for new environments with no existing traffic. For
information about when to use load balancer authorization with a Google-managed
certificate, see Domain authorization types for Google-managed certificates .
You can create Google-managed certificates with load balancer authorization only
in the global location. Load balancer authorized certificates don't
support wildcard domains.
Roles required for this task
To perform this task, you must have one of the following IAM roles on the target Google Cloud project.
Certificate Manager Editor role ( roles/certificatemanager.editor )
Certificate Manager Owner role ( roles/certificatemanager.owner )
For more information, see Roles and permissions .
Note: If you aren't assigned the required roles, contact the
IAM Administrator who has the Project IAM Admin role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin ) to grant you the missing roles.

DNS authorization
To use Google-managed certificates before your production environment is ready,
you can provision them with DNS authorizations. For information about when to
use DNS authorization with a Google-managed certificate, see Domain
authorization types for Google-managed
certificates .
To independently manage certificates across multiple projects, you can use
per-project DNS authorization. For
information about creating certificates with per-project DNS authorization, see
Create a DNS authorization .
Before you create the certificate, do the following:
Create a DNS
authorization for each of
the domain names covered by the certificate.

FILTER : an expression that constrains the returned results to specific values.
For example, you can filter the results by the
following criteria:
Expiration time: --filter='expire_time >= "2021-09-01T00:00:00Z"'
SAN DNS names: --filter='san_dnsnames:"example.com"'
Certificate state: --filter='managed.state=FAILED'
Certificate type: --filter='managed:*'
Labels and creation time: --filter='labels.key:value AND
create_time > "2021-09-01T00:00:00Z"'
For more filtering examples that you can use with
Certificate Manager, see Sorting and filtering list
results in the Cloud Key Management Service documentation.
PAGE_SIZE : the number of results to return per page.
SORT_BY : a comma-separated list of name fields by which
the returned results are sorted. The default sort order is ascending; for
descending sort order, prefix the field with a tilde ( ~ ).

Console
If your project contains more than 10,000 certificates that are managed by
Certificate Manager, the Certificate Manager page in the
Google Cloud console won't list them. Instead, use the gcloud CLI
command. However, if you have a direct link to the certificate's Details
page, you can view its details in the Google Cloud console.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Certificate Manager page.
Go to Certificate Manager
On the page that appears, select the Certificates tab.
On the Certificates tab, go to the target certificate, and then
click the certificate's name. The Certificate details page displays
detailed information about the selected certificate.

certificates.get method as follows:
GET /v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /certificates/ CERTIFICATE_NAME
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project.
LOCATION : the target Google Cloud location.
CERTIFICATE_NAME : the name of the certificate.
