This page describes various best practices for configuring and managing
certificates on Google Cloud by using
Certificate Manager and
Certificate Authority Service (CA Service). This
page describes how to design your certificate management architecture.
Before reading this page, make sure that you're familiar with the
Certificate Manager overview
and the Certificate Authority Service overview
pages.
Design your certificate management architecture
When designing an enterprise certificate management strategy, you must consider
your organization's key use cases and the entire lifecycle of your certificates.
These decisions affect the cost, operational overhead, and ease of implementing
certificate-management capabilities such as issuance, revocation, and rotation.
The following sections explain our recommendations for each design choice.
Choose a certificate type
When creating a certificate, you must make sure to select a certificate type
that's appropriate for your use case depending on your application requirements
and your organization's security policies.
To analyze the type of certificate that might work best for you, see the
following flowchart:
Assess which certificate type to choose (click to enlarge).
Here are a few helpful documentation links for the topics mentioned in the
flowchart:
Google-managed certificates
Certificate authority pool
Certificate Authority Service overview
Self-managed certificates
Streamline your private CA Service hierarchy
We recommend that you keep the hierarchy of your CA Service as
straightforward as possible to ensure smooth operations and troubleshooting. You
must store your root certificate authority (CA) in its own Google project. The
root CA signs a few intermediate CAs, and those CAs then issue the final
certificates.
This flat hierarchical structure enhances transparency, simplifies certificate
revocation processes, and reduces the likelihood of misconfigurations. Although
CA Service is a regional service, a root CA in one region can
sign subordinate CAs located in other regions.
Follow these best practices in your CA Service hierarchy as
shown in the diagram:
Isolate your root CA in its own Google Cloud project to sign the issuing
CA.
Create issuing CAs in CA pools that are hosted in separate projects. Host
these pools in separate projects and segment them by geographic location
(region), software development lifecycle (development, production, test), or a
specific use case.
Configure Certificate Manager to use an issuing CA pool that
can issue privately trusted certificates for supported resources.

Important: Even if you use a regional CA pool that's integrated with
Certificate Manager, you can use the CA pool to issue a global
Google-managed TLS certificate in any region.
Use comprehensive hostname coverage
We recommend that you make sure your certificates provide sufficient hostname
coverage for all the domains and subdomains that your services need to protect.
Inadequate hostname coverage can lead to security warnings for users, service
disruptions, and a negative user experience.
Avoid using a single certificate for multiple domains. If the single certificate
either fails to renew or is accidentally deleted, then all domains that it
covers become unsecured. We recommend that you create distinct certificates for
different domains.
If you plan to add new subdomains or services later, then use wildcard
characters to include the subdomains or services in your certificate from the
outset. For example, a wildcard
certificate for *.myorg.example.com secures only the first
subdomain level, but not the deeper subdomain levels such as
sub.subdomain.myorg.example.com .
Use Google-managed certificates
For efficient public certificate management and ease of use, we recommend that
you use Google-managed certificates .
This approach significantly reduces operational overhead, automating tasks
such as certificate rotation and eliminating the risks associated with manual
renewals.
In addition, Google-managed certificates offer seamless integration with other
Google Cloud services. Google-managed certificates are valid for 90 days,
and the renewal process begins about one month before they expire.
Important: You can prevent the creation of global self-managed TLS certificates
in your organization by implementing the
constraints/compute.disableGlobalSelfManagedSslCertificate policy
constraint.
Scale and improve your certificate performance
The following sections describe the best practices to scale your certificates
and improve the performance of certificate-related actions, such as provisioning
and renewal.
Apply decentralized deployment for Certificate Manager
Use Certificate Manager on a per-project
and per-location basis, which means that your certificates are stored in the
same project as their associated resources in the same region. This strategy
enhances reliability by preventing certificate reuse across different regions
and effectively minimizing the impact in the unlikely event of a regional outage.
Furthermore, because quotas and limits are
applied at the Google Cloud project-level, deploying
Certificate Manager across multiple projects increases your
overall quotas. This is because the use of a resource in one project doesn't
affect your available quota in another project.
Use certificates with ECDSA keys
This section examines why we recommend ECDSA over RSA
as a best practice for certificate signing keys.
Which key type to use
ECDSA P-256 is the recommended choice of key type for most TLS certificates
because ECDSA P-256 offers strong cryptographic security, excellent performance
for signing operations, and efficient use of network bandwidth.
Some of the possible reasons to use other certificate key types are as follows:
If you need to support legacy clients that
don't support ECDSA certificates, you can provide RSA-2048 certificates
in addition to ECDSA P-256 certificates.
If you have specific compliance requirements that require you to use
larger key sizes or particular key types, then you can use ECDSA P-384,
RSA-2048, RSA-3072, and RSA-4096 keys.
Why choose ECDSA over RSA
The primary advantage of ECDSA lies in its ability to provide an equivalent
cryptographic security level with significantly smaller keys compared with RSA.
This efficiency translates into tangible performance and resource benefits. A
smaller key doesn't imply weaker security—ECDSA is based on the elliptic
curve discrete logarithm problem, which provides stronger security per unit of
key, and in some cases better computational efficiency compared with RSA.
For example:
A 256-bit ECDSA key provides a similar security level to an RSA-3072 key.
A 384-bit ECDSA key provides a greater security level than any
widely supported RSA key size.
Key benefits of ECDSA:
Performance : ECDSA signing operations are significantly less
computationally intensive than RSA operations providing an equivalent security
level. This reduces CPU load and latency, which is crucial for high-throughput
or latency-sensitive systems.
Efficiency : smaller keys and signatures require less bandwidth and
storage, which is especially beneficial for resource-constrained environments
like mobile and IoT devices.
You can create the following custom organization policy to enforce the use of specific key types
in your certificates. This is applicable only for Google-managed certificates
from CA Service (private trust-managed certificates), not for
self-managed certificates and public-trust Google-managed certificates.
name: organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/customConstraints/custom.restrictAlgorithm \
resourceTypes: \
- certificatemanager.googleapis.com/CertificateIssuanceConfig \
methodTypes: \

- UPDATE \
condition: "resource.keyAlgorithm == 'ECDSA_P256'" \
actionType: ALLOW \
displayName: Allow only ECDSA_P256 in Certificate Issuance configs \
description: Only ECDSA_P256 certificates are allowed from CA Service.
Use a CA pool to issue certificates from private CAs
We recommend that you use CA pools for your issuing CAs. A CA pool is a
collection of multiple CAs with a common certificate issuance policy and
Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. Using a CA pool
increases the total effective queries per second (QPS)
by load balancing and distributing the incoming certificate requests across all
enabled CAs within the pool. This improves performance without impacting either
the workload or client-side changes.
CA pools provide a single endpoint for certificate issuance and retrieval. You
can use CA pools to safely rotate your CAs without causing downtime due to
certificate expiration or compromise.
Use certificate maps
To ensure optimal scalability, we recommend that you use
certificate maps with
supported resources. Certificate maps are designed to scale, supporting
thousands of certificate entries by default and capable of handling millions of
certificates. When used by load balancers, certificate map entries take
precedence over other certificates, such as Compute Engine SSL certificates.
Certificate maps also let you configure your certificate selection logic. For
example, during a handshake if a client's hostname doesn't match any entry in
the provisioned certificate map, then the load balancer returns the primary
certificate.
Choose the correct domain authorization type
To issue Google-managed certificates, you can prove your domain ownership by
using either
load balancer authorization
or DNS authorization .
The following table describes the considerations for each approach:
Feature
Load balancer authorization
DNS authorization
Setup complexity
Doesn't require any additional configuration steps or
changes to your DNS configuration.
Requires you to create a DNS authorization and add its
corresponding CNAME record to your DNS configuration.
Network security
The load balancer must be fully accessible by using the
internet on port 443 , including the DNS
configuration for
all domains served by a certificate. Load balancer
authorization doesn't work with other configurations.
DNS authorization works with highly complex
configurations, such as ports
other than 443, and CDN layers in front of the target proxy.
Provisioning speed
Faster provisioning speed. You can provision certificates
only after the load balancer is fully set up and is serving
network traffic.
You can provision certificates in advance, before the
target proxy is ready to serve network traffic.
Wildcard certificates
Not supported.
Supported.
Automate rotation of self-managed certificates
Unlike Google-managed certificates, self-managed certificates need to be
manually replaced before they expire. We recommend that you automate this
process by using the Certificate Lifecycle Management (CLM) offerings of your choice.
This helps reduce errors, downtime, and ensure operational efficiency.
You can also use certificate maps to orchestrate a seamless certificate
rotation. This process includes the following steps:
Monitor certificate expiration by using
Cloud Monitoring and alerts .
We recommend that you create an alert for certificates expiring in the next 15
to 30 days.
Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) and a private key to submit to
your CA.
Submit your CSR and private key to your CA, and then retrieve the new
certificate.
Upload the new certificate to Certificate Manager to an
appropriate certificate map.
If the domain names in the new certificate match with an
about-to-expire certificate, then use the
UpdateCertificate method on the
existing certificate resource.
If the new certificate has different domain names, then first use the
CreateCertificateRequest method with the new PEM (privacy-enhanced mail) files
to create it. Then, use the UpdateCertificateMapEntry method to
replace the old certificate's reference in the certificate map with the new
one.
Important : You must complete this process in one API call without
resulting in any downtime.
Apply appropriate access controls
We recommend that you consider the principles of least privilege and separation
of duties when configuring your access controls. The following sections explain
these recommendations in more detail.
Apply the principle of least privilege
When assigning permissions to manage certificates, consider the principle of
least privilege and grant the minimum permissions needed to perform a task. We
strongly recommend that you avoid using basic IAM roles. Instead,
grant predefined or custom Certificate Manager and
CA Service roles to mitigate any risk of security incidents
related to over-privileged access.
Plan for separation of duties
We recommend that you maintain distinct identities and permissions for certificate
administrators and those who have either the certificate issuer or certificate
requester role. To do so, create separate administrator and requester groups at
the top of the resource hierarchy for your users.
Make sure that your administrators group is responsible for performing the
following actions:
Manage and maintain your certificate infrastructure such as CA provisioning.
Configure certificate templates.
Manage your certificate revocation list (CRL)) and online certificate
status protocol (OCSP) responders.
Implement security policies for your CA.
Important: Make sure that your administrators group contains a small number of
users to reduce the risk of misconfiguration or abuse.
For projects that host a root CA, avoid assigning basic roles such as
Owner ( roles/owner ), Editor ( roles/editor ), and CA Service Admin
( roles/privateca.admin ) to any user or group. This practice prevents
accidental deletion, misconfiguration, and over exposure. Instead, use
Privileged Access Manager (PAM) for just-in-time (JIT) access as
needed with justification and approvals after the root CA is installed and
configured.
Make sure that the requester group is responsible for the day-to-day operations
of processing certificate requests and issuing certificates based on predefined
templates.
The following table lists the IAM roles that are typically
associated with various job functions:
Persona
Description
IAM roles
Certificate administrators
Set up and manage CA and certificate infrastructure.
Certificate Manager Owner ( roles/certificatemanager.owner ),
CA Service Admin ( roles/privateca.admin )
Certificate requester
Request certificates for workloads.
Certificate Authority Service Certificate Requester
( roles/privateca.certificateRequester )
Workloads (automation service accounts)
Used by workloads or in pipelines to request certificates.
Certificate Authority Service Workload Certificate Requester
( roles/privateca.workloadCertificateRequester )
Security engineers or PKI owners
Manage certificate policy, revocation, and lifecycle.
CA Service Operation Manager ( roles/privateca.caManager ),
Certificate Authority Service Certificate Manager ( roles/privateca.certificateManager )
DevOps or platform engineers
Manage the deployment of certificates on load balancers,
and more.
Certificate Manager Editor ( roles/certificatemanager.editor )
Auditor or compliance
Monitor certificates and their usage.
Certificate Manager Viewer ( roles/certificatemanager.viewer ),
Certificate Authority Service Auditor ( roles/privateca.auditor )
Use per-project DNS authorization for multi-region and multi-cloud deployments
We recommend that you use the
per-project DNS authorization
approach to independently manage multiple authorizations for projects across
multiple regions, multiple clouds, and across the software development lifecycle
(SDLC).
Compartmentalizing DNS authorizations helps ensure that each project maintains
its own distinct set of DNS records and permissions. This level of control lets
each project manage its DNS configurations autonomously, without interfering
with or being affected by the operations of other projects. For example, a
development team can experiment with new DNS configurations for their specific
application without risking any adverse impact on the production systems or
other ongoing projects.
Use CAA records to protect your domains
Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) records are a security mechanism
in the Domain Name System (DNS). CAA records provide domain owners with
complete control to configure the public Certification Authorities (CAs) that
can issue certificates for their domains. This control is important in
preventing the unauthorized issuance of certificates. With CAA in place, the
attack surface for fraudulent certificates is reduced, effectively making
websites more secure.
For Google-managed certificates, we recommend that you manually authorize the
following for the best reliability of your certificate issuance and renewal
requests:
pki.goog
letsencrypt.org
Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and visibility
The following sections describe the best practices for audit logging and for
monitoring certificate usage and expiration.
Enable and aggregate audit logging
To monitor all resources of your organization, aggregate the
Admin activity audit logs
for all services, including Certificate Manager, into a
centralized location.
This lets your security team or auditor review all activity related to creating
or modifying Certificate Manager and CA Service
resources in one place. For more information about configuring aggregated logs,
see Aggregate and store your organization's logs .
Monitor certificate usage and expiration
We recommend that you set up log-based alerts for important
Certificate Manager events, such as root CA usage, certificate
expiration, and certificate deletion. These alerts help you triage operations,
such as a high rate of certificate-creation failures, and can trigger a
downstream process to either request a new certificate or increase the quota.
Configure the following log alerts and policies for privilege-related
operations:
Certificates close to expiry
Expired Public certificates
CA expiring in 30 days
High rate of certificate creation failures
Expired CA certificates
CA Service KMS key issue
Compliance requirements
Typically, compliance frameworks specify high-level expectations and objectives
for certificate management rather than for specific products or configurations.
For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) require organizations to
document and implement rotation periods for signing keys. They also mandate the
continuous monitoring of inventory and all trusted signing keys and certificates
that protect cardholder data.
For more information about how Google Cloud services can help meet various
compliance framework requirements, see the following resources:
