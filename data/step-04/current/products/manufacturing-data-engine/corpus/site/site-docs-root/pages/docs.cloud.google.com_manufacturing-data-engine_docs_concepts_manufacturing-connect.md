Manufacturing Connect
Manufacturing Connect (MC) is a software component designed by
Litmus Automation and developed exclusively for
Google Cloud. MC solves factory connectivity in a modern,
scalable, and vendor independent way. With a library of
270+ supported automation protocols (and the option
to add more), entire factories can be quickly connected to Manufacturing Data Engine (MDE).
In case a specific equipment is not covered in MC's
extensive library ,
a new driver can be built by Litmus Automation upon request - typically in a few weeks.
MC has two principal components:
Manufacturing Connect edge (MCe) : A software stack that is deployed within the
factory.
MC : A cloud-based app that deploys in customers'
Google Cloud tenants for managing all edge instances and
MDE from a single web interface.
Relationship with MDE
For customers using both MC and MDE :
The MC web interface includes the interface to MDE,
enabling a seamless edge-to-cloud user experience.
For customers using MDE only (without MC) :
Starting with MDE v1.3, a standalone web interface for
MDE is included in the release package. Like in previous releases, API-based
configuration and management remains available in addition to the web interface.
Factory network connection
MC can be deployed in multiple ways to comply with your
factory network topology. Both Google and our partner Litmus Automation are happy to
advise you on the best model for your circumstances:
Decentralized (close to individual lines) or centralized (such as in a
factory data center).
As a container, virtual machine (VM), or operating system.
Note: MC is compatible with GKE Enterprise environments.
Node RED component
MCe offers an analytics editor based on Node RED integration. It
comes with a number of common transformations, KPI calculations, and basic
threshold-based rules. Using it is entirely optional, but supports customers
that like to do some initial calculations at the edge to provide calculated
values with low latency (and independent of internet connection status) to
other on-premise systems
(such as Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)).
Integration with other edge systems
SCADA and MES systems are typically designed with integration in mind, and offer
interfaces that IMC can connect to (such as OPC UA, Modbus, and more). These
systems often contain beneficial metadata (for example, active recipe on the
manufacturing line) that is important to store on Google Cloud to process
machine sensor data in the right context.
You can set the sampling rate from Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and
transmission rate for data upload to Google Cloud. Sampling rate can
be defined in MC (up to many times
per second). Data upload to Google Cloud is generally event-driven, typically
once per second.
PLCs connection from one edge deployment
Depends on the underlying hardware or virtual machine size, and additional
factors such as sampling rate. Generally 10,000 tags (PLC register values)
per edge deployment are a good rule of thumb to work with.
Manufacturing Connect edge (MCe)
MCe acts as a bridge between the physical world of your
factory and the digital world of Google Cloud, enabling you to use data for
improved efficiency, productivity, and insights.
Hardware requirements
The setup of MC and MCe typically take a few hours
at most, including connecting to a number of PLCs. A key driver of the overall timeline
is obtaining and setting up firewall permissions. Some customers are able to
complete this within a day, while others take a few weeks to navigate
company-internal processes.
For more information about hardware requirements, see the
MCe Installation and Configuration overview .
Secure connection
Communication between MCe and Google Cloud are performed
over PKI encrypted channels for Pub/Sub. The
Pub/Sub connection is authenticated using a service account key.
Additionally to the encryption, the network traffic between
MC and Pub/Sub can be routed through private connectivity options between
onPrem and Cloud (Interconnect or VPN) to private endpoints of Google APIs. In
such a scenario, the traffic between corporate networks and Google Cloud is
not crossing the public internet by being processed only within the customer's
private network perimeters.
Litmus Automation
Google partnered with Litmus Automation to create the MC, an
integrated edge-to-cloud offering in a Google Cloud exclusive product. However,
MC is sold, supported, and maintained by Litmus Automation.
With the deep integration with MDE,
customers benefit from ease of use and speed to deploy.
For updating MCe, Litmus provides updated files that can be
rolled out to edge deployments. Configurations are persisted between updates
(when using official release
versions).
You can direct any questions to the following help resources by Litmus Automation:
Manufacturing Connect on Google Cloud Marketplace .
Litmus Automation Help Center including documentation
and contact for enquiries and support.
Supported protocols and drivers .
Note: Besides MC, Google offers various alternative partner-based
solutions (such as OSIsoft) with ready-to-use connectors to set up
factory-to-cloud connectivity. Additionally, MDE
can be integrated with most custom edge stacks as required.
