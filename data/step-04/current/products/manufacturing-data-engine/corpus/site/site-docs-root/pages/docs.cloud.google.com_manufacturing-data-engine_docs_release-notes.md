that exceeds a predefined threshold (default is 200 instance). This protects the
platform from performance degradation that is caused by configuration errors.
For best practices on how to use the MDE metadata system, see the metadata
concept page .
Note : If you are upgrading from older releases, the Terraform may not be
able to perform an in-place upgrade for the Cloud Storage Writer dataflow job. In that
case, you need to stop it manually, before starting the upgrade.
Change
Improvement (330297418) : Enable the three-projects topology for
bigquery-sink: the service to be deployed in a project, the Pub/Sub in
another project, and the BigQuery datasets in a third project. Find
these as dedicated properties in the BigQuery sink helm chart.

Security
The vulnerability scanner may flag a critical CVE related to the zlib
libraries in the base OS of the container images. The binary of this impacted
library is not built in the MDE container images, and it is not impacted by this
vulnerability. Nonetheless, once a new Debian OS patch is available, MDE will
release an updated container images so that the vulnerability scanner does not
flag this issue. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Debian tracker .

This release is not a critical update , unless you are directly impacted by the bug fixes, you don't need to update, and you can wait for future releases before upgrading.
Important: This release introduces a limitation on the execution time of
parsers. If the parser execution time exceeds seven seconds, it will be preempted
and an error message will be produced in the operations log. If the parser needs
more than seven seconds, we recommend to break it into multiple parsers and
attach it to the same message class.

Fix (294819318) : When cloning LookML repository, it could fail.
Fix (294981315) : Helm chart for adding LB to MC update to use the correct
resource label.
Fix (295163432) : When deploying MDE in some Google Cloud project, the
deployment with terraform apply would recreate the GKE cluster with each
apply.
Fix (295548129) : Old validation script from v.1.2.0 removed from package.
Fix (294807712) : MDE web interface had a wrong name in the title.

Announcement
Version 1.3.0
This release is a critical update .
Change
Refined the metadata bucket configuration entity by distinguishing between
Tag and Record buckets and allow for data contextualization at different
aggregation levels.
Improved query experience and performance in BigQuery by normalizing
metadata, allowing efficient retrieval of metadata without needing to unnest
records, and enabling new query patterns.
Improved support for Bigtable sink, allowing all archetypes to be stored in Bigtable.
Improved query performance by associating each type with a dedicated table
in BigQuery to better take advantage of table partitioning.
Tag names are now global, and parsers targeting different types can emit
records referencing the same tag name.
Improved Federation API surface that enables new data access patterns for
all archetypes.
The number of required fields in a parser has been reduced.
Improved logging and introduced the ability to set logging levels.
Improved observability and monitoring by exposing new Cloud Monitoring
metrics.
Internal performance improvements.
Improved documentation, deployment and configuration guides, as well as
improved access and distribution to documentation content.
Reduced the cost by 20% for smaller instances of MDE by migrating key data
processing workloads from Dataflow to GKE.
Improved the default configuration package by providing better integration
with MCe and enabling the ingestion of any data stream with minimal
structural requirements. The configuration package now supports the
ingestion of data arrays and complex value objects from MCe.
Upgraded to Whistle v1.4.0.
Improved transformation model: added the capability to apply several
versions of the same transformation to the same Type.
Issue
Issue (294526878) : When updating metadata instances in the web interface on a Tag it is not possible to add empty string "" as a value.
Workaround : Use the API if you need to insert an empty string as a value
for a metadata instance attribute.
Issue (294525580) : Disable message class does not actually disable the
message class in the system.
Workaround : Delete the message class instead using the API.
Issue (294809257) : Missing bucket or natural key references can cause
Metadata Manager service to spam the Operations Log tables in BigQuery.
Take great care when working with parsers to create the bucket
beforehand and double check log for any errors when having deployed a
new parser.
Feature
New features
Added a standalone UI for Manufacturing Data Engine for deployment without
Manufacturing Connect.
Introduced a new archetype family - clustered - to enable user-defined data
clustering logic in BigQuery and row-key generation in Bigtable for the
Federation API.
Introduced a Pub/Sub sink to allow for extensibility and custom integration.
Support for messages in both JSON and ProtoBuf.
Extended the BigQuery schema with new fields to simplify and better support
analytics use-cases. See the schema changes in the v1.3 BigQuery Schemas documentation .
Introduced new datasets in BigQuery: mde_data , mde_dimension , and mde_system to improve data table governance.
Configuration data is now exported to dedicated tables in the mde_system
dataset.
Introduced type versioning.
Introduced Lookup buckets to enable retrieving reference data in the parser.
Introduced type - metadata bucket associations and improved metadata
validation by providing the ability to require record contextualization with
specific bucket metadata.
Added a new identifier (natural key) to metadata instances to enable
retrieval of instances by a business-friendly key, such as the tag name,
allowing users to manage shared instances centrally.
Introduced new custom Whistle functions to look up metadata instances in
parsers by natural key.
Introduced shared cache using Redis.
Introduced more granular deployment sizes to support varied deployment
scenarios.
Created a MDE LookML library to distribute common MDE LookML components and
configuration packages.
Change
Metadata buckets support only a single schema and the schema is a property of the bucket.
Configuration Manager API has been refactored into configuration and Metadata management API, and the API surface has been simplified to align with Google API design and general REST API best practices.
BigQuery schema changes:
Removed default archetype tables.
Removed sfp_data dataset .
Improved storage footprint by removing fields from abstract base schemas of types (archetype schemas). See the schema changes in the v1.3 reference.
Changed field naming style from camel case to snakecase.
Configuration model concepts have been refined and renamed.
Simplified proto record schemas by removing redundant fields
AVRO files containing processed data stored in the Cloud Storage data sink are stored by type.
