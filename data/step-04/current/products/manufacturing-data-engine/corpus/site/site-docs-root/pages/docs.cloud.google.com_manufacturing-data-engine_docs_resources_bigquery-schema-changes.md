BigQuery schema changes
This guide shows any updates on data schema changes when releasing new
Manufacturing Data Engine (MDE) versions.
Changes from versions 1.2 to 1.3
Some BigQuery table schema changes from v1.2 to v1.3 are not
backwards-compatible. The following table describes these changes.
Record tables
All records in MDE v1.2 were stored in one of three archetype
tables. In MDE
v1.3, records are stored in tables per Type ( record tables ) where each Type is
tied to a specific Archetype. The following table is an overview of the key
changes in field names:
