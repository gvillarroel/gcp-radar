Overview
Manufacturing Data Engine (MDE) is an end-to-end solution that delivers
scalable and seamless connectivity between the factory floor and the cloud, in
combination with Manufacturing Connect (MC) .
MDE provides a zero
code pre-configured set of Google Cloud infrastructure that is able to ingest,
process, and store data from industrial devices in the cloud based on the user's
configuration. After the machine and processed data is available in Google Cloud,
it is possible to use Google Cloud tools and technologies to extract value from
that data.
Acquiring industrial data has traditionally been a high-complexity and high-cost
process that adds unnecessary time and cost to any cloud-based industrial
information management use case. MDE is a flexible solution that
makes that process shorter,
more efficient, and more predictable.
MDE
handles the end-to-end need of ingesting, contextualizing, storing, and using
factory data on the cloud. Together with Manufacturing Connect (MC), it
also extends directly to the source of data - the machines and systems on the
factory floor, across any automation vendor standard.
MDE is delivered as a packaged solution. A script
deploys all the required components and the integration code into your
Google Cloud project. This unlocks maximum flexibility for you to modify and
extend the architecture based on your needs.
Manufacturing solutions
MDE is a core component within a suite of
interconnected manufacturing solutions. While some other components can function
independently, its true power lies in its integration. These components
work together to create a comprehensive manufacturing data platform. Data is
collected, processed, analyzed, and used to drive insights and improve
operational performance.
The end-to-end suite is composed of components built by
Google and components built by Litmus Automation exclusively for Google.
Manufacturing Data Engine : It serves as the acquisition,
transformation and storage layer of the suite. MDE
provides a secure, efficient and reliable data lake containing all
manufacturing information, and acts as a data hub for all use cases to connect
and access manufacturing information.
Manufacturing Connect (MC) : Cloud component to remotely manage all
Manufacturing Connect edge (MCe) instances. It also acts as a web interface for the
configuration of the MDE solution. For more
information, see MC documentation (opens in a new tab) .
Note: A standalone web interface for MDE
is available as well for customers without MC or
MCe.
Manufacturing Connect edge (MCe) : Edge to cloud gateway capable of
translating more than 270 industrial communication protocols into standardized
Pub/Sub messages. Additional features include edge processing and
storage capabilities. For more
information, see MCe documentation (opens in a new tab) .
Manufacturing Analytics and Insights : A prebuilt LookerML
integration with MDE. It enables immediately using
Looker as BI tool to explore and analyze
MDE factory data.
Machine Anomaly Detection : Based on Time Series Insights API.
Visual Inspection AI : An edge solution based on the Cloud Vision API.
The components of the manufacturing suite are designed to work seamlessly
together. They share a common configuration and are semantically interoperable,
ensuring smooth data flow and consistent behavior across the suite. However,
you also have the flexibility to use these components individually based on
your specific needs.
MDE and the rest of the components are
configurable. Users can define their specific data requirements and the system
adjusts to those specifications without having to modify the code underlying
the solution. Configuration can be updated using the MC user
interface, the standalone MDE web
interface, or the MDE
configuration API.
Key benefits
The key benefits of MDE include:
Time-to-value : Fast deployment in standard Google Cloud
environments. Machine connectivity (if not yet in place) can be also quickly
set up using MC.
Scalability : Useful from Proof of Concepts (PoCs) to global enterprise
deployments across hundreds of factories.
Efficiency : By capturing data once in
MDE as a "factory abstraction layer",
all use cases can be driven from MDE.
Fine-grained control over storage and processing enables cost efficient setups.
Full flexibility : Can work with any edge stack, just requires data to land
in Pub/Sub directly or using Message Queuing Telemetry
Transport (MQTT) bridge, with custom definition parsers to
map incoming data schemas to the MDE
standard.
Adaptability : As MDE deploys fully
in your own Google Cloud tenant project, all
MDE components (such as
Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and BigQuery) are
transparent and can be used as if you had built the platform yourself.
Ownership : Since all the components of
MDE are deployed within your
Google Cloud tenant project,
you remain in full control over your data and processing.
Extensibility : All Google Cloud integrations (such as
BigQuery connectors) are usable with
MDE by default. You can additionally enable
MDE-specific extensions
for specific use cases (built by Google or partners) and build your own.
Cost-Effective : There are no extra costs for using
MDE. You only pay for your cloud
consumption, which starts at a minimal level for PoCs. However, consider
that using MC incurs an additional cost. For more
information, see
MC Cloud Marketplace .
Use cases
Production planning, order tracking, progress, and process parameter control are
use cases that are typically covered by automation
systems. We seek to augment and complement, rather than replace such systems.
With Google Cloud you can gain valuable new insights that can be fed into your
existing automation systems, such as SCADA, allowing you to take action
and improve OEE and other important KPIs.
When it comes to Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), companies have different
approaches. Some stick with their existing on-premise MES, while others are
moving to cloud-based solutions. MDE is a solid
foundation to quickly implement key MES features if required.
The use cases enabled by MDE fall primarily
into three categories:
Analytical use cases : Combine MDE
with Google Cloud data analytics products to produce reports, calculate KPIs,
and create real-time dashboards using data streamed from the manufacturing floor.
Machine learning use cases : Build on Google Cloud Machine Learning (ML)
products and platforms to create, train, and execute ML models that are relevant
to optimize any aspect of the manufacturing operation.
Integration use cases : Connect manufacturing data with digital twin
solutions or other enterprise systems to provide an integrated view of the
manufacturing data with other perspectives available in the company.
Capabilities
MDE fulfills the following capabilities:
Data ingestion : Either from MC or
any other commercial or proprietary edge stack.
Edge Data Processing : MCe processes and stores data locally for immediate
analysis.
Cloud Data Integration : MC transforms data into MQTT and Pub/Sub
messages, seamlessly integrating with Google Cloud.
Syntactic standardization : Uses standard data storage schemas for a
variety of data archetypes, driving reusability of the data across use cases
such as:
Self-service analytics for factory managers and maintenance personnel.
Fully managed, ML-based anomaly detection that can be enabled for
individual sensor streams (automatic fingerprinting, no setup required).
Semantic flexibility : Uses integrated data contextualization engine to
optionally enrich incoming sensors or variable data streams, enabling multiple
user-definable contextualization perspectives based on the following standards:
ISA-95 hierarchy
Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL)
OPC Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) companion specs
Asset Administration Shell (AAS)
Data Transformation and Enrichment : Maps, transforms, and contextualizes data
according to user-defined schemas.
Real-time Analytics : Calculates streaming analytics and transformations based
on user configurations.
Data Storage and Output : Stores processed data in BigQuery,
Bigtable, and Cloud Storage, and outputs to Pub/Sub.
Monitoring and Management : Provides a user-friendly interface to monitor and
manage the entire solution.
Flexible Configuration : Offers a straightforward interface for configuring
data flows and processing pipelines.
Accessible through API and web interface : for programmatic access,
automation, and management.
Components
The following are components of MDE:
Configuration Manager : Manages the user configurations and exposes them to
other solution components.
Message Mapper : Processes incoming messages and classifies them into
source message classes, as well as performs Whistle transformations.
Metadata Manager : Manages metadata buckets and instances, and participates
in record processing.
Batch Ingestion Cloud Storage Bucket : Bucket for uploading files
for batch ingestion.
Cloud Storage Reader : Responsible for reading batch data from
files uploaded to Cloud Storage.
Cloud Storage Writer : Responsible for writing raw source
messages to the Cloud Storage archive, as well as processed records to
the Cloud Storage sink.
Bigtable Writer : Responsible for writing records to the
Bigtable sink.
BigQuery Writer : Responsible for writing records to the
BigQuery sink.
Pub/Sub Topics : Pub/Sub is the message broker
of MDE that is used to route messages
between the different components of the solution. Several topics and
subscriptions are created to ensure the routing of the incoming messages is done
according to the user configuration. All messages arrive in the system using
the input-messages topic.
Databases and Storage : MDE manages
BigQuery datasets, Bigtable tables, and
Cloud Storage objects.
Federation API : MDE provides an API
to access all data repositories using a common interface. This allows users to
query their data independently of where it is stored and enables them using the
same configuration language to create specific queries to the manufacturing
information.
Data engine in the factory
Typically a single instance of MDE would
serve all factories. The underlying Google Cloud components (such as
Pub/Sub) are global and scalable to enable this approach.
If you choose to still deploy multiple
instances, Google Cloud database products such as BigQuery enable
accessing global data across multiple instances. The Manufacturing Connect edge (MCe)
instances are deployed as gateways usually on factory level. Multiple
MCe can
be interconnected by using the built-in NATS integration.
Use of MES for machine performance, events and traceability
MDE complements your existing MES system
rather than replacing it. It uses it as a data source and sink.
MDE gets important context or metadata
from it (such as active recipe, schedules, events, and others), and uses these
data points as tags similar to sensor values. This context data is required to
make sense of the machine sensor data (for example, the expected sensor pattern
is different based on the recipe. That is, what the machine is producing).
MDE output (for example, ML predictions)
can absolutely be integrated back to the MES, for example for alerting.
Integration of MQTT with MDE
There are several options in the Google Cloud marketplace, which among other
factors, depend on the MQTT broker vendor.
HiveMQ ,
for example, provides a Pub/Sub extension. You can also build your own custom
MQTT bridge or use
Dataflow .
