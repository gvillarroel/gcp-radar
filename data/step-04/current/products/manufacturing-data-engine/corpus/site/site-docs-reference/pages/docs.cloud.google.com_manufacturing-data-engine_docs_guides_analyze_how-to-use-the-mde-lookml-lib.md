Use the LookML Library
The LookML Library for MDE provides
abstract core files, and packaged views, explores and dashboards to help you get
started with building your own LookML models on top of the
MDE data in BigQuery.
Before you begin
To complete this guide, you need the following prerequisites:
You configured a new Looker project using the
MDE Project Template as described in the
setup guide .
You have an active MDE deployment.
Optional . You applied the default
MDE configuration package .
While you can use the MDE LookML Library to create
custom views, the default LookML package requires the default
MDE configuration package is applied.
Exploring library contents
After the project is allowed, you can explore the contents of the library
under the imported_projects/mde_lookml_lib directory in the
Looker development console. The library provides content in
two directories:
mde_abstract_core
mde_packages
Abstract core directory
The mde_abstract_core directory provides base views that you can use to
model MDE metadata buckets as dimensions and
MDE record tables as fact tables in Looker.
The base views save you from needing define the shared fields across
these views.
The library provides a dim_base.view view for building dimensions, which
you can find in
imported_projects/mde_lookml_lib/mde_abstract_core/views/dimension/dim_base.view.lkml .
The following example shows how you can extend the base view to define a
dimension called device :
include : "//mde_lookml_lib/mde_abstract_core/views/dimension/*.view"
view : dim_source {
derived_table : {
sql : SELECT * FROM `mde_dimension.metadata-store` where bucket_number = BUCKET_NUMBER ;;
}
view_label : "DIM - Device"
extends : [ dim_base ]
dimension : device_name {
type : string
sql : JSON_VALUE(${TABLE}.instance,"$.device_name") ;;
}
}
And, similarly, the library provides base views per MDE
archetype for modeling record tables in BigQuery as fact
tables. You can find the base views under
imported_projects/mde_lookml_lib/mde_abstract_core/views/fact/ . You can
extend the archetype base views to define custom fact views in
Looker. The following example shows how you can define a fact
view called sensor_readings :
include : "//mde_lookml_lib/mde_abstract_core/views/fact/fct_numeric_archetype.view"
view : fct_sensor_readings {
extends : [ fct_numeric_archetype ]
label : "FCT - Sensor Readings"
sql_table_name : ` mde_data.sensor-readings` ;;
}
Packages
The mde_packages directory contains prebuilt LookML packages for
MDE. These packages provide use-case specific explores,
views and dashboards to get you started quickly.
The default Looker configuration package works in conjunction
with the default MDE configuration package. For more
information, see the Default configuration package guide .
The default Looker configuration package provides a fact table
per record table linked to an MDE type, as well tag and
source dimensions, which correspond to the tag and source metadata buckets in
MDE, respectively.
If you used the MDE Project Template to
bootstrap
a new MDE project, the provided Looker model
automatically imports the views and explores from the default package:
connection : "@{looker_connection}"
########## DEFAULT MDE EXPLORES ##########
include : "//mde_lookml_lib/mde_packages/default/explores/default.explore.lkml"
############ CUSTOM VIEWS ################
include : "/views/dimension/*.view"
include : "/views/fact/*.view"
Once your project is set up, you can use the default default explores in
Looker to analyze data.
You can also use other configuration packages included in the
library. See the following section for further instructions and
prerequisites to use these packages in the library.
Extend views provided by the configuration packages in the library
You can extend the fact and dimension views included in the library by using the
extends
syntax. For example, in your project model file you can extend the dim_tag by
defining additional dimension fields on the deviceMetadata object, as the
following script shows:
view : +dim_tag {
dimension : device_type {
type : string
sql : JSON_VALUE(${TABLE}.instance,"$.deviceMetadata.deviceType") ;;
}
dimension : location {
type : string
sql : JSON_VALUE(${TABLE}.instance,"$.deviceMetadata.location") ;;
}
}
Dashboards access is defined in the default configuration package
The LookML model defined in the MDE Project Template
imports all the dashboards from the default package in
MDE LookML Library . To access any of
these dashboards, open the following link:
https:// LOOK_HOST /dashboards/mde:: DASHBOARD_ID
Replace the following:
LOOK_HOST with the hostname of your Looker instance.
DASHBOARD_ID with the ID of the dashboard you want to open. You can look
up the dashboard ID, by opening the relevant .dashboard file in the
imported_projects/mde_lookml_lib/mde_packages/default/dashboards/ directory
and copying the value of the dashboard property.
