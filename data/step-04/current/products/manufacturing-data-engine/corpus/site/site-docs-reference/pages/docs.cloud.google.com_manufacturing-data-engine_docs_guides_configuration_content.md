File content
This page describes the content of each configuration package folder on
Manufacturing Data Engine (MDE)'s package.
Under each configuration package folder, MDE expects to
find one JSON file per configuration object. If you want to create two buckets,
then there should be two separate files. The names of the files are ignored.
However, it's recommended to name the files after the configuration object name
that you would like to create. The actual JSON schema for each object depends on
the type of the configuration entity you want to create, but it matches
the JSON schema of the corresponding API response.
To organize the configuration package further, you can refer to other JSON
files to be embedded in the file under a particular field. For example, the
following JSON specifies an MDE bucket with a schema where the
schema is defined in another JSON file. This enhances the overall readability
and maintainability of the configuration package.
{
"type" : "TAG" ,
"name" : "second-tag-bucket" ,
"attributes" : {
"instanceOverwriteMode" : "true"
},
"versions" : [
{
"version" : 1 ,
"schema" : "'{{schemas/generic-schema.json}}'" ,
"provider" : "local" ,
}
]
}
To reference another file, you can use the
{{relative-path/file.json}}
directive which contains the relative path of the file that needs to be
included in the existing file. MDE will resolve the file and
include the JSON contents as the value of the field that has the reference
directive. The value of the schema field in the previous example, will
contain an embedded JSON sub-object that matches the contents of the file.
For certain objects, you need to embed the JSON contents as a string. As an
example, the schema field in the bucket object requires the bucket schema
to be embedded as a string, and in that case, the reference directive should be
surrounded by single quotes ' which tells MDE to embed the
contents unprocessed as a string; the reference directive will be:
'{{relative-path/file.json}}' .
The referenced file could be in any directory, and you can create different
directories for organization purposes. For example, the directory called
schemas in the previous example is an arbitrary folder structure to group
common files together. The type of files that can be embedded are either
JSON or WSTL for Whistle scripts.
The following are sample configurations for each MDE entity.
