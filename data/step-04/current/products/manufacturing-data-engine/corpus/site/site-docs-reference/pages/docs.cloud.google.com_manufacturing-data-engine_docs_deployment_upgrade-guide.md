Upgrade guide
This guide provides general guidance on how to upgrade an existing
Manufacturing Data Engine (MDE) installation using Terraform.
If you have modified Terraform scripts you might need additional
steps. This is a generic upgrade guide so always make sure that you also read
the full releases notes for the
specific version you are deploying as this may include information you need to
take into consideration.
Caution: If you are upgrading from v1.4.x to v1.5, the process will recreate
some of the internal Pub/Sub subscriptions. Make sure that the existing
MDE instance is fully drained and that it doesn't have any
internal messages in the Pub/Sub subscriptions before running the
upgrade script. You can achieve this by
stopping the messages sent to the input-message subscription. Note: MDE only supports sequential upgrades. If you are running
a major release earlier than 1.4.x, you must upgrade your MDE
one major version at a time.
Before you begin
Note: Before upgrading your MDE deployment, see the
Known issues page.
Some Dataflow jobs need to be stopped manually before upgrading. The
release notes list the
jobs you have to stop manually for the specific version you are upgrading to.
This guide requires the follow prerequisites:
You are using the default deployment package.
Your client environment has the required CLI tools installed in their
most updated version:
Google Cloud CLI with the following additional components installed:
kubectl
cbt
Terraform CLI
( 1.9.x or later)
Helm CLI (3.9.x or later)
You can use any client environment to deploy MDE, but
you can save time by deploying from Cloud Shell since it has most of
the required tools already installed.
Activate Cloud Shell
You have full access to the MDE Google Cloud project and
access to the configuration files used for the original deployment:
Service Account JSON key file: mde-imgs-service-account-key.json .
Terraform: input.tfvars .
Terraform: backend.conf .
Note: MDE v1.5 doesn't require the Service Account JSON key file.
All gcloud commands in this guide assume that the default project is set
to the MDE deployment project. You can set the
default project using the following command:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the MDE deployment project ID.
You have acquired the credentials for the MDE
GKE cluster. Use the following command if you haven't already:
export CLUSTER_NAME = "mde-gke"
export CLUSTER_LOCATION = $( gcloud container clusters list --filter = "name: $CLUSTER_NAME " --format = "value(LOCATION)" )
# when upgrading to 1.5.2 we need to enable DNS endpoint on GKE cluster to allow Terraform connect to it
gcloud container clusters update $CLUSTER_NAME --region $CLUSTER_LOCATION --enable-dns-access
export KUBE_CONFIG_PATH = ~/.kube/config
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME --region $CLUSTER_LOCATION --dns-endpoint
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name of the cluster if you changed the
default name ( mde-gke ). Change KUBE_CONFIG_PATH if your kubeconfig is not on the default path.
Upgrade
This section provides guidance on how perform the upgrade using Terraform.
Update the Terraform service account permissions to add the newly required
permissions from MDE 1.4.0 and up. They can be added by
using the following commands:
export PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get-value project )
export SA_TERRAFORM = "mde-tf"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $ PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: $ SA_TERRAFORM @ $ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = 'roles/file.editor'
Backup the old deployment folder using the following command:
cp -r MDE_FOLDER MDE_FOLDER_BACKUP
Replace MDE_FOLDER and
MDE_FOLDER_BACKUP with the name
of the MDE folder and backup folder.
Download the latest MDE solution release package and
extract it:
Note: Access to the MDE deployment assets requires approval
from your Google Cloud team. We suggest reaching out to them as soon as
possible if you are interested in testing or deploying MDE.
If you don't know who your Google Cloud account team is, feel
free to use the Contact Us button on the top right of the screen and we
will be in touch shortly.
Download the solution package.
Extract the package to your client environment.
Move into the new release folder using the cd command.
If you are upgrading to v1.4.x, copy the following files from the backup to the new folder using the
following commands (files paths may differ):
cp ../ MDE_FOLDER_BACKUP /mde-imgs-service-account-key.json .
cd deployment/terraform
cp ../../../ MDE_FOLDER_BACKUP /deployment/terraform/input.tfvars .
cp ../../../ MDE_FOLDER_BACKUP /deployment/terraform/backend.conf .
If you are upgrading to v1.5.1, copy only the following files:
cd deployment/terraform
cp ../../../ MDE_FOLDER_BACKUP /deployment/terraform/input.tfvars .
cp ../../../ MDE_FOLDER_BACKUP /deployment/terraform/backend.conf .
Replace MDE_FOLDER_BACKUP with the
MDE backup folder name.
If you are upgrading from v.1.4.x to v1.5.x or from v1.5.0 to v1.5.1, run the pre-upgrade
script included in the release package:
Note: Make sure that you run this script after all the Pub/Sub subscriptions have been drained,
you can use the '/configuration/v1/processing:stop' API or toggle the Messages processing switch in
the MDE UI to stop the processing and let the system drain before running this script.
# Execute script from the upgrade/1.5 directory and return to the terraform directory
cd ../../upgrade/1.5
export BQ_PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get-value project )
export PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get-value project )
sh migrate-metadata-instance-bq-table.sh " $BQ_PROJECT_ID " " $PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID "
cd ../../deployment/terraform
If you are upgrading to 1.5.2, you need to switch the Kubernetes
providers to use the local kubeconfig in the providers.tf file with the
following command:
provider "kubernetes" {
config_path = "~/.kube/config"
# host = "https://${local.gke_host}"
# token = data...
# cluster_ca_certificate = local.gke_ca_cert
}
provider "helm" {
kubernetes {
config_path = "~/.kube/config"
# host = "https://${local.gke_host}"
# token = data...
# cluster_ca_certificate = local.gke_ca_cert
}
}
Note: After you have finished applying the upgrade (after step 10), this
change can be rolled back to continue using the dynamic Kubernetes
configuration inside Terraform.
Reload the Terraform state using the following command:
terraform init -backend-config = backend.conf -reconfigure
Create a Terraform plan.
Once the input parameters are ready, you must create a Terraform plan using
the following command. You can use the plan to verify what artifacts and
configurations will be created in the project.
Note: Since the Service Account key is no longer necessary after v1.5.x, you might see a Terraform
warning about mde_artifact_registry_sa_path . You can safely ignore this warning, comment out or
delete this variable from the input.tfvars file.
terraform plan -var-file = ./input.tfvars -out = ./tfplan
You can browse the planned changed by using this command:
terraform show -no-color ./tfplan > tfplan.txt
more tfplan.txt
Important: If Terraform shows errors during the planning phase that certain
Pub/Sub subscriptions that end up with the -materialization suffix
can't be deleted because they have a lifecycle.prevent_destroy flag, then you
will need to manually delete all of the Pub/Sub topics that end up
with the -materialization suffix along with the subscriptions that were
attached to it. You will need to perform this step before starting the
deployment to make sure that the topics are created automatically by
MDE post the deployment.
Apply the Terraform plan using the following command:
terraform apply ./tfplan
Verify that the deployment succeeded.
After the terraform apply command finishes executing, you should see a
success message that looks similar to the following (the actual number will
depend on the specific deployment options and version):
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 34 changed, 0 destroyed.
Post Upgrade
After the upgrade is complete, you need to perform one or more of the following
steps depending on the status of the earlier MDE deployment.
BigQuery views for existing types
If you are upgrading from a release before 1.4.x, then the created types won't
have an analytics view created for it as this feature was introduced in 1.4.0.
You'll need to activate the existing types once again to trigger the analytics
view recreation. You can check the /activate endpoint in the Postman kit that's
shipped with the release.
GKE cluster filestore driver
If you experience an issue that the GKE cluster pods are starting or stuck in
ContainerCreating , then it could be the result of the filestore driver not
being enabled. You can enable it by following the steps in the deployment
guide
