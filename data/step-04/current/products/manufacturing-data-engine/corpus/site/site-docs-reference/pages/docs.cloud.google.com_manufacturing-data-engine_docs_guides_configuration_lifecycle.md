Package lifecycle
This page describes Manufacturing Data Engine (MDE)'s package lifecycle.
Upload a new configuration package
You can upload a new MDE's configuration package using
the a REST endpoint or from the
MDE web interface by providing a single *.zip file.
REST
Execute the REST API request with the following information:
Method : POST.
Endpoint : /configuration/v1/configuration-packages .
Request body : multiform data with key=”packageArchive”, value=configuration-package-zip file .
Response code : 200 OK.
Response body (JSON) :

}
]
}
]
}
Console
Click Cloud Configuration .
Click ADD NEW CONFIGURATION PACKAGE .
Select the file to upload to the console.
Click UPLOAD .
After the package is uploaded, MDE will process it by
running the following stages:
Validation : In this stage, MDE validates the contents of
the package, it ensures that all the files are syntactically correct and that
they are in the right place. If this phase is successfully completed, then
MDE proceeds to the next stage.
Loading : In this stage, MDE tries to load and merge the
configurations specified in the package with the current environment
configurations. It checks any dependencies and makes sure that there are no
naming collisions with existing configurations. This stage is atomic, which
means that the package will either successfully be loaded, or it will be
rolled-back completely. If the loading is successful, then MDE
will proceed with the next stage.
Activation : In this stage MDE activates the configuration
and makes it visible to the rest of the environment users. It also triggers
the creation of any infrastructure elements required as part of the package
configuration (for example, activating a type).
Note: After the configuration package activation, MDE will not activate the parsers
contained in the configuration package (if there are any). You must activate the parsers manually. This
directs the traffic to the configuration entities of the new package.
MDE v1.5.0 doesn't support updates for already
deployed or activated packages. You can upload the same package again as
long as it isn't active if this is required to fix any errors in either the
validation or the loading stages. Once the package is set to active, you
can't upload the same package again or upload a package that contains
configuration entities with conflicting names.
List existing configuration packages
You can list existing MDE's configuration package using
the a REST endpoint or from the
MDE web interface.

Console
You can see the list of existing configuration packages on the
Cloud Configuration section, in the Configurations page.
Delete an existing configuration package
Starting in v1.5.0, MDE supports an environment flag that can
change the environment to
development mode ,
which lets you delete configuration entities and delete configuration packages.
After this mode is set, you can then delete an already activated package using
the REST endpoint or the MDE web interface delete button.
Warning: Deleting a package will result in deleting all the configuration,
infrastructure, and data for that configuration package. If the package
contains types, then the table of that type will be deleted along with its data
from BigQuery, and the other sinks. Similarly, if the package contains
a bucket, then the bucket along with its metadata instances will be deleted
from BigQuery and from MDE internal databases.
That's why these features are only enabled in development mode, and you should
use them with caution.
