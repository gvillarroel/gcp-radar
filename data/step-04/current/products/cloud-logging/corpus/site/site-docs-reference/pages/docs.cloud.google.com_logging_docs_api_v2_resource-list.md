Monitored resources and services
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides information about the Google Cloud resource types and
services that Cloud Logging uses. This information can help you
understand Google Cloud platform logs , which are
service-specific logs that can help you debug and troubleshoot issues as well
as understand the Google Cloud services you're using.
If you use BindPlane to write your on-premise and hybrid cloud logs, then you
can find these logs under the resource type generic_node .
Monitored resource types
The following table lists all the Cloud Logging monitored resource
types, their labels, and descriptive information. The information shown for
each monitored resource type is defined in the
MonitoredResourceDescriptor object . This table is
regenerated frequently, and the timestamp is shown at the end of the table.
When writing log entries, MonitoredResourceDescriptor.type has to be one of
the following types. You can't create your own monitored resource
types; these are created by Google Cloud.
For non-Google Cloud resources, we recommend you can use the generic
types generic_node or generic_task .
The list of monitored resource types in Logging might not match
list of monitored resource types in Monitoring .

Mappings for Logging-only resources
For log-based metrics to be ingested by Monitoring,
the metrics must be mapped to a monitored-resource type
supported by Monitoring. The mappings are also required to view
corresponding logs from a Monitoring chart or alert.
In many cases, Logging and Monitoring use the
same monitored-resource types. However, for certain monitored-resource types
in Logging, there is no corresponding type in
Monitoring. In these cases, the Logging resource
types are mapped to an existing Monitoring type.
Mappings to global
The following monitored-resource types in Logging map to
the global type in
Monitoring:
Note: The global monitored-resource type only contains the project_id label.
Any labels in the Cloud Logging monitored-resource type are not available in
the corresponding log-based metric.
