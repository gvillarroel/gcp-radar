Use log rotation for Ops Agent self logs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Ops Agent writes to a log file called logging-module.log . When the
agent runs unattended for long periods or when a problem occurs, this
"self log" file can consume all available disk space. This document describes
how to use log rotation to prevent this problem.
Ops Agent version 2.31.0 introduces
a configurable log-rotation feature built into the agent. If you are running
Ops Agent version 2.31.0 or newer, then
you can use the built-in log-rotation feature; see
Configure log rotation in the Ops Agent .
You can also manage log rotation manually. You might need a manual process
if you are using a version of the Ops Agent without built-in log rotation,
or if you prefer to rotate your logs manually. See Set up self-log file
rotation on Linux VMs for one possible approach.
Configure log rotation in the Ops Agent
This section describes how to modify the default log-rotation configuration
used by Ops Agent to rotate its logs automatically.
Using this feature requires Ops Agent version
2.31.0 or newer.
Default configuration
The Ops Agent uses the default_self_log_file_rotation entry to
configure log rotation. This configuration entry takes three options;
the following snippet shows the options and their default values:
default_self_log_file_rotation:
enabled: true
max_file_size_megabytes: 400
backup_count: 1
The default_self_log_file_rotation configuration takes three options:
enabled : Whether log rotation is enabled; default is true .
max_file_size_megabytes : The maximum size the log file can reach before
it is backed up by log rotation.
Measured in megabytes (1024 2 bytes). Default is 400, minimum
valid value is 1.
backup_count : The number of old log files to retain. Default is 1,
minimum valid value is 1.
User configuration of log rotation
To modify the default log-rotation configuration, you override that
configuration by redefining the configuration in the Ops Agent
user-configuration file:
On Linux: /etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml
On Windows: C:\Program Files\Google\Cloud Operations\Ops Agent\config\config.yaml
Note: If you make any changes to the configuration file, then you must
restart the agent to apply the
updated configurations.
To configure log rotation in the Ops Agent, add a global section
to the user configuration file and include the configuration element
default_self_log_file_rotation in the global section. You might
already have logging or metrics pipelines in the this configuration file;
add the global section after your pipelines. The result, specifying all
options and default values, looks like the following:
logging: ...
metrics: ...
global:
default_self_log_file_rotation:
enabled: true
max_file_size_megabytes: 400
backup_count: 1
Example configurations
To disable log rotation by the Ops Agent, specify the enabled option with the
value false :
logging: ...
metrics: ...
global:
default_self_log_file_rotation:
enabled: false
To rotate the log when the log file reaches 20 MB and keep 5 backups
(6 files total):
logging: ...
metrics: ...
global:
default_self_log_file_rotation:
max_file_size_megabytes: 20
backup_count: 5
To rotate the log when the log file reaches 2,000 MB (2 GB)
and keep 1 backup (2 files total):
logging: ...
metrics: ...
global:
default_self_log_file_rotation:
max_file_size_megabytes: 2000
To rotate the log when the log file reaches 400 MB and keep 2 backups
(3 files total):
logging: ...
metrics: ...
global:
default_self_log_file_rotation:
backup_count: 2
If you make frequent changes as you refine your log-rotation configuration,
remember to restart the agent to
apply your changes.
Set up self-log file rotation on Linux VMs
To limit the size of the logging sub-agent log at
/var/log/google-cloud-ops-agent/subagents/logging-module.log , install and
configure the logrotate utility.
Install the logrotate utility by running the following command:
On Debian and Ubuntu
sudo apt install logrotate
On CentOS, RHEL and Fedora
sudo yum install logrotate
Create a logrotate config file at
/etc/logrotate.d/google-cloud-ops-agent.conf .
sudo tee / etc / logrotate . d / google - cloud - ops - agent . conf > / dev / null << EOF
# logrotate config to rotate Google Cloud Ops Agent self log file.
# See https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/logrotate/logrotate.8.en.html for
# the full options.
/ var / log / google - cloud - ops - agent / subagents / logging - module . log
{
# Log files are rotated every day.
daily
# Log files are rotated this many times before being removed. This
# effectively limits the disk space used by the Ops Agent self log files.
rotate 30
# Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than maxsize even before the
# additionally specified time interval
maxsize 256 M
# Skip rotation if the log file is missing.
missingok
# Do not rotate the log if it is empty.
notifempty
# Old versions of log files are compressed with gzip by default.
compress
# Postpone compression of the previous log file to the next rotation
# cycle.
delaycompress
}
EOF
Set up crontab or systemd
timer to trigger the
logrotate utility periodically.
After the log rotation takes effect, you see rotated files in the
/var/log/google-cloud-ops-agent/subagents/ directory. The results look similar
to the following output:
/ var / log / google - cloud - ops - agent / subagents $ ls - lh
total 24 K
- rw - r -- r -- 1 root root 717 Sep 3 19 : 54 logging - module . log
- rw - r -- r -- 1 root root 6.8 K Sep 3 19 : 51 logging - module . log . 1
- rw - r -- r -- 1 root root 874 Sep 3 19 : 50 logging - module . log . 2. gz
- rw - r -- r -- 1 root root 873 Sep 3 19 : 50 logging - module . log . 3. gz
- rw - r -- r -- 1 root root 3.2 K Sep 3 19 : 34 logging - module . log . 4. gz
To test log rotation, do the following:
Temporarily reduce the file size at which rotation is triggered by setting
the maxsize value to 1k in the
/etc/logrotate.d/google-cloud-ops-agent.conf file.
Trigger the agent self log file to be larger than 1K by restarting the agent
a few times:
sudo service google-cloud-ops-agent restart
Wait for the crontab or systemd timer to take effect to trigger the
logrotate utility, or trigger the logrotate utility manually by running
this command:
sudo logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/google-cloud-ops-agent.conf
Verify that you see rotated log files in the
/var/log/google-cloud-ops-agent/subagents/ directory.
Reset the log-rotation configuration by restoring the original maxsize
value.
