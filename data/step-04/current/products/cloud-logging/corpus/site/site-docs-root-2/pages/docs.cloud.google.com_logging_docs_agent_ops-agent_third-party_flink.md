Apache Flink
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Apache Flink integration collects client, jobmanager and taskmanager logs
and parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes fields for source,
level, and message.
For more information about Flink, see the
Apache Flink documentation .
Prerequisites
To collect Flink telemetry, you must
install the Ops Agent :
For metrics, install version 2.18.1 or higher.
For logs, install version 2.17.0 or higher.
This integration supports Flink versions 1.12.5, 1.13.6, and 1.14.4.
Configure the Ops Agent for Flink
Following the guide to Configure the Ops
Agent , add the required elements
to collect telemetry from Flink instances, and
restart the agent .
Example configuration
The following commands create the configuration to collect and ingest telemetry
for Flink:
# Configures Ops Agent to collect telemetry from the app . You must restart the agent for the configuration to take effect .
set - e
# Check if the file exists
if [ ! - f / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml ]; then
# Create the file if it doesn ' t exist .
sudo mkdir - p / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent
sudo touch / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml
fi
# Create a back up of the existing file so existing configurations are not lost .
sudo cp / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml . bak
# Configure the Ops Agent .
sudo tee / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml > / dev / null << EOF

For these changes to take effect, you must restart the Ops Agent:
Linux
To restart the agent, run the following command on your instance:
sudo systemctl restart google-cloud-ops-agent
To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and
verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started:
sudo systemctl status "google-cloud-ops-agent*"
Windows
Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges by
right-clicking the PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator
To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command:
Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force
To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and
verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started:
Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent*
Configure logs collection
To ingest logs from Flink, you must create a receiver for the logs
that Flink produces and then create a pipeline for the new receiver.
To configure a receiver for your flink logs, specify the following
fields:
Field
Default
Description
exclude_paths
A list of filesystem path patterns to exclude from the set matched by include_paths .
include_paths
[/opt/flink/log/flink-*-standalonesession-*.log, /opt/flink/log/flink-*-taskexecutor-*.log, /opt/flink/log/flink-*-client-*.log]
A list of filesystem paths to read by tailing each file. A wild card ( * ) can be used in the paths.
record_log_file_path
false
If set to true , then the path to the specific file from which the log record was obtained appears in the output log entry as the value of the agent.googleapis.com/log_file_path label. When using a wildcard, only the path of the file from which the record was obtained is recorded.
type
This value must be flink .
wildcard_refresh_interval
60s
The interval at which wildcard file paths in include_paths are refreshed. Given as a time duration , for example 30s or 2m . This property might be useful under high logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default interval.
What is logged
The logName is derived from
the receiver IDs specified in the configuration. Detailed fields inside the
LogEntry
are as follows.
The flink logs contain the following fields in the LogEntry :
Field
Type
Description
jsonPayload.level
string
Log entry level
jsonPayload.message
string
Log message, including detailed stacktrace where provided
jsonPayload.source
string
The source Java class of the log entry
severity
string ( LogSeverity )
Log entry level (translated).
Configure metrics collection
To ingest metrics from Flink, you must create a receiver for the metrics
that Flink produces and then create a pipeline for the new receiver.
This receiver does not
support the use of multiple instances in the configuration, for example, to
monitor multiple endpoints. All such instances write to the same time series,
and Cloud Monitoring has no way to distinguish among them.
To configure a receiver for your flink metrics, specify the following
fields:
Field
Default
Description
collection_interval
60s
A time duration value, such as 30s or 5m .
endpoint
http://localhost:8081
The URL exposed by Flink.
type
This value must be flink .
What is monitored
The following table provides the list of metrics that the Ops Agent collects
from the Flink instance.

Verify the configuration
This section describes how to verify that you correctly configured the
Flink receiver. It might take one or two
minutes for the Ops Agent to begin collecting telemetry.
To verify that Flink logs are being sent to
Cloud Logging, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
segment
Logs Explorer page:
Go to Logs Explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Logging .
Enter the following query in the editor, and then click Run query :
resource.type="gce_instance"
log_id("flink")
To verify that Flink metrics are being sent to
Cloud Monitoring, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
leaderboard Metrics explorer page:
Go to Metrics explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
In the toolbar of the
query-builder pane, select the button whose name is either
code MQL or code PromQL .
Verify that PromQL is selected
in the Language toggle. The language toggle is in the same toolbar that
lets you format your query.
Enter the following query in the editor, and then click Run query :
{"workload.googleapis.com/flink.jvm.memory.heap.used", monitored_resource="gce_instance"}
View dashboard
To view your Flink metrics, you must have a chart or dashboard
configured.
The Flink integration includes one or more dashboards for you.
Any dashboards are automatically installed after you configure the
integration and the Ops Agent has begun collecting metric data.
You can also view static previews of dashboards without
installing the integration.
To view an installed dashboard, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the dashboard Dashboards page:
Go to Dashboards
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Select the Dashboard List tab, and then choose the
Integrations category.
Click the name of the dashboard you want to view.
If you have configured an integration but the dashboard has not been
installed, then check that the Ops Agent is running. When there is no
metric data for a chart in the dashboard, installation of the dashboard fails.
After the Ops Agent begins collecting metrics, the dashboard is installed
for you.
To view a static preview of the dashboard, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Integrations
page:
Go to Integrations
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Click the Compute Engine deployment-platform filter.
Locate the entry for
Flink
and click View Details .
Select the Dashboards tab to see a static preview. If the
dashboard is installed, then you can navigate to it by clicking
View dashboard .
For more information about dashboards in Cloud Monitoring, see
Dashboards and charts .
For more information about using the Integrations page, see
Manage integrations .
Install alerting policies
Alerting policies instruct Cloud Monitoring to notify you when
specified conditions occur.
The Flink integration includes one or more alerting policies for
you to use.
You can view and install
these alerting policies from the Integrations page in
Monitoring.
To view the descriptions of available alerting policies and
install them, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Integrations
page:
Go to Integrations
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Locate the entry for
Flink
and click View Details .
Select the Alerts tab. This tab provides descriptions of
available alerting policies and provides an interface for installing
them.
Install alerting policies. Alerting policies need
to know where to send notifications that the alert has been
triggered, so they require information from you for installation.
To install alerting policies, do the following:
From the list of available alerting policies,
select those that you want to install.
In the Configure notifications section, select one or
more notification channels. You have the option to disable the
use of notification channels, but if you do, then your alerting
policies fire silently. You can check their status in
Monitoring, but you receive no notifications.
For more information about notification channels,
see Manage
notification channels .
Click Create Policies .
For more information about alerting policies in Cloud Monitoring, see
Introduction to alerting .
For more information about using the Integrations page, see
Manage integrations .
