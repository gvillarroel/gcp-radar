Elasticsearch 7.9+
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Elasticsearch is an open-source search server, based on the
Lucene search library. It runs in a Java virtual
machine on top of a number of operating systems. The elasticsearch receiver
collects node- and cluster-level telemetry from your Elasticsearch instances.
Note: This document refers only to the support for Elasticsearch 7.9+ versions.
For information about later versions, see
Elasticsearch 8.0+ and 9.0+ .
The most significant difference between the two documents is in the names of some of the log fields.
For more information about Elasticsearch, see the
Elasticsearch 7.9+ documentation .
Prerequisites
To collect Elasticsearch telemetry, you must
install the Ops Agent :
For metrics, install version 2.21.0 or higher.
For logs, install version 2.9.0 or higher.
This integration supports Elasticsearch version 7.9+.
Configure your Elasticsearch instance
If you enable Elasticsearch security
features ,
you must configure a user with the monitor or manage cluster
privilege .
Configure the Ops Agent for Elasticsearch
Following the guide to Configure the Ops
Agent , add the required elements
to collect telemetry from Elasticsearch instances, and
restart the agent .
Example configuration
The following commands create the configuration to collect and ingest telemetry
for Elasticsearch:
# Configures Ops Agent to collect telemetry from the app . You must restart the agent for the configuration to take effect .
set - e
# Check if the file exists
if [ ! - f / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml ]; then
# Create the file if it doesn ' t exist .
sudo mkdir - p / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent
sudo touch / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml
fi
# Create a back up of the existing file so existing configurations are not lost .
sudo cp / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml . bak
# Configure the Ops Agent .
sudo tee / etc / google - cloud - ops - agent / config . yaml > / dev / null << EOF

For these changes to take effect, you must restart the Ops Agent:
Linux
To restart the agent, run the following command on your instance:
sudo systemctl restart google-cloud-ops-agent
To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and
verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started:
sudo systemctl status "google-cloud-ops-agent*"
Windows
Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges by
right-clicking the PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator
To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command:
Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force
To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and
verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started:
Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent*
Configure logs collection
To ingest logs from Elasticsearch, you must create a receiver for the logs
that Elasticsearch produces and then create a pipeline for the new receiver.
To configure a receiver for your elasticsearch_json logs, specify the following
fields:
Field
Default
Description
exclude_paths
A list of filesystem path patterns to exclude from the set matched by include_paths .
include_paths
[/var/log/elasticsearch/*_server.json, /var/log/elasticsearch/*_deprecation.json, /var/log/elasticsearch/*_index_search_slowlog.json, /var/log/elasticsearch/*_index_indexing_slowlog.json, /var/log/elasticsearch/*_audit.json]
A list of filesystem paths to read by tailing each file. A wild card ( * ) can be used in the paths.
record_log_file_path
false
If set to true , then the path to the specific file from which the log record was obtained appears in the output log entry as the value of the agent.googleapis.com/log_file_path label. When using a wildcard, only the path of the file from which the record was obtained is recorded.
type
This value must be elasticsearch_json .
wildcard_refresh_interval
60s
The interval at which wildcard file paths in include_paths are refreshed. Given as a time duration , for example 30s or 2m . This property might be useful under high logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default interval.
To configure a receiver for your elasticsearch_gc logs, specify the following
fields:
Field
Default
Description
exclude_paths
A list of filesystem path patterns to exclude from the set matched by include_paths .
include_paths
[/var/log/elasticsearch/gc.log]
A list of filesystem paths to read by tailing each file. A wild card ( * ) can be used in the paths.
record_log_file_path
false
If set to true , then the path to the specific file from which the log record was obtained appears in the output log entry as the value of the agent.googleapis.com/log_file_path label. When using a wildcard, only the path of the file from which the record was obtained is recorded.
type
This value must be elasticsearch_gc .
wildcard_refresh_interval
60s
The interval at which wildcard file paths in include_paths are refreshed. Given as a time duration , for example 30s or 2m . This property might be useful under high logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default interval.
What is logged
The logName is derived from
the receiver IDs specified in the configuration. Detailed fields inside the
LogEntry
are as follows.
The elasticsearch_json logs contain the following fields in the LogEntry :
Field
Type
Description
jsonPayload.cluster
string
The cluster emitting the log record
jsonPayload.cluster.name
string
The name of the cluster emitting the log record
jsonPayload.cluster.uuid
string
The UUID of the cluster emitting the log record
jsonPayload.component
string
The component of Elasticsearch that emitted the log
jsonPayload.level
string
Log entry level
jsonPayload.message
string
Log message
jsonPayload.node
string
The node emitting the log record
jsonPayload.node.name
string
The name of the node emitting the log record
jsonPayload.node.uuid
string
The UUID of the node emitting the log record
jsonPayload.type
string
The type of log, indicating which log the record came from (e.g. server indicates this LogEntry came from the server log)

jsonPayload.message
string
Log message
jsonPayload.type
string
The type of the log record
severity
string ( LogSeverity )
Log entry level (translated).
Configure metrics collection
To ingest metrics from Elasticsearch, you must create a receiver for the metrics
that Elasticsearch produces and then create a pipeline for the new receiver.
This receiver does not
support the use of multiple instances in the configuration, for example, to
monitor multiple endpoints. All such instances write to the same time series,
and Cloud Monitoring has no way to distinguish among them.
To configure a receiver for your elasticsearch metrics, specify the following
fields:
Field
Default
Description
ca_file
Path to the CA certificate. As a client, this verifies the server certificate. If empty, the receiver uses the system root CA.
cert_file
Path to the TLS certificate to use for mTLS-required connections.
collection_interval
60s
A time duration value, such as 30s or 5m .
endpoint
http://localhost:92002
The base URL for the Elasticsearch REST API.
insecure
true
Sets whether or not to use a secure TLS connection. If set to false , then TLS is enabled.
insecure_skip_verify
false
Sets whether or not to skip verifying the certificate. If insecure is set to true , then the insecure_skip_verify value is not used.
key_file
Path to the TLS key to use for mTLS-required connections.
password
Password for authentication with Elasticsearch. Required if username is set.
type
This value must be elasticsearch .
username
Username for authentication with Elasticsearch. Required if password is set.

Verify the configuration
This section describes how to verify that you correctly configured the
Elasticsearch receiver. It might take one or two
minutes for the Ops Agent to begin collecting telemetry.
To verify that Elasticsearch logs are being sent to
Cloud Logging, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
segment
Logs Explorer page:
Go to Logs Explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Logging .
Enter the following query in the editor, and then click Run query :
resource.type="gce_instance"
(log_id("elasticsearch_json") OR log_id("elasticsearch_gc"))
To verify that Elasticsearch metrics are being sent to
Cloud Monitoring, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
leaderboard Metrics explorer page:
Go to Metrics explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
In the toolbar of the
query-builder pane, select the button whose name is either
code MQL or code PromQL .
Verify that PromQL is selected
in the Language toggle. The language toggle is in the same toolbar that
lets you format your query.
Enter the following query in the editor, and then click Run query :
{"workload.googleapis.com/elasticsearch.node.open_files", monitored_resource="gce_instance"}
View dashboard
To view your Elasticsearch metrics, you must have a chart or dashboard
configured.
The Elasticsearch integration includes one or more dashboards for you.
Any dashboards are automatically installed after you configure the
integration and the Ops Agent has begun collecting metric data.
You can also view static previews of dashboards without
installing the integration.
To view an installed dashboard, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the dashboard Dashboards page:
Go to Dashboards
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Select the Dashboard List tab, and then choose the
Integrations category.
Click the name of the dashboard you want to view.
If you have configured an integration but the dashboard has not been
installed, then check that the Ops Agent is running. When there is no
metric data for a chart in the dashboard, installation of the dashboard fails.
After the Ops Agent begins collecting metrics, the dashboard is installed
for you.
To view a static preview of the dashboard, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Integrations
page:
Go to Integrations
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Click the Compute Engine deployment-platform filter.
Locate the entry for
Elasticsearch
and click View Details .
Select the Dashboards tab to see a static preview. If the
dashboard is installed, then you can navigate to it by clicking
View dashboard .
For more information about dashboards in Cloud Monitoring, see
Dashboards and charts .
For more information about using the Integrations page, see
Manage integrations .
Install alerting policies
Alerting policies instruct Cloud Monitoring to notify you when
specified conditions occur.
The Elasticsearch integration includes one or more alerting policies for
you to use.
You can view and install
these alerting policies from the Integrations page in
Monitoring.
To view the descriptions of available alerting policies and
install them, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Integrations
page:
Go to Integrations
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Locate the entry for
Elasticsearch
and click View Details .
Select the Alerts tab. This tab provides descriptions of
available alerting policies and provides an interface for installing
them.
Install alerting policies. Alerting policies need
to know where to send notifications that the alert has been
triggered, so they require information from you for installation.
To install alerting policies, do the following:
From the list of available alerting policies,
select those that you want to install.
In the Configure notifications section, select one or
more notification channels. You have the option to disable the
use of notification channels, but if you do, then your alerting
policies fire silently. You can check their status in
Monitoring, but you receive no notifications.
For more information about notification channels,
see Manage
notification channels .
Click Create Policies .
For more information about alerting policies in Cloud Monitoring, see
Introduction to alerting .
For more information about using the Integrations page, see
Manage integrations .
