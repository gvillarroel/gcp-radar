Installing the Ops Agent on individual VMs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Ops Agent collects logs and metrics on Compute Engine instances, sending
your logs to Cloud Logging and your metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
Before you begin
To install the agent, ensure that you have the following:
A supported VM instance in a
Google Cloud project.
A supported operating system .
Credentials on the VM instance that authorize communication with
Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring. Compute Engine VM instances
generally have the correct credentials by default. If you are running very old
Compute Engine instances or if you created Compute Engine
instances without the default credentials, then you might not have the proper
credentials. You must complete the
Authorize the Ops Agent procedures.
Ensure that you enable the services for both
the Cloud Logging API and Cloud Monitoring API.
Ensure your VM doesn't have the legacy Cloud Logging
agent or Cloud Monitoring agent
installed on it. This can cause ingestion of duplicate logs or a conflict in
metrics ingestion. In addition, this agent uses new configuration files that
are not compatible with the old agents.
If you have the old agents installed, save the custom configuration files for
the Cloud Monitoring agent
and the custom configuration files for the Cloud Logging
agent , and complete the
uninstall steps for the Cloud Monitoring
agent and the uninstall steps for
the Cloud Logging agent .
For users with VMs that don't have access to remote package repositories,
refer to the VMs without remote package access
section for more information.
Install the agent automatically during VM creation
For more information, see
Install the Ops Agent during VM creation .
Install the agent from the command line
Note: First verify that all conditions are met in the Before you
begin section.
To install the agent using the command line, use the following instructions.
Install the latest version of the agent
To install the latest version of the agent, complete the following steps.
Linux
Open a terminal connection to your VM instance using SSH or a similar tool
and ensure you have sudo access.
Change to a directory you have write access to, for example your home
directory.
Download and run the agent-installation script by using the following
commands:
curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/add-google-cloud-ops-agent-repo.sh
sudo bash add-google-cloud-ops-agent-repo.sh --also-install
After it is installed, the agent is started automatically.
Windows
Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges by right-clicking the
PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator .
Run the following PowerShell commands:
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/add-google-cloud-ops-agent-repo.ps1", "${env:UserProfile}\add-google-cloud-ops-agent-repo.ps1")
Invoke-Expression "${env:UserProfile}\add-google-cloud-ops-agent-repo.ps1 -AlsoInstall"
Installing a specific version of the agent
To install a specific version of the agent, complete the following steps.
Linux
Open a terminal connection to your VM instance using SSH or a similar tool
and ensure you have sudo access.
Change to a directory you have write access to, for example your home
directory.
Download the agent installation script:
curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/add-google-cloud-ops-agent-repo.sh
When running the add-google-cloud-ops-agent-repo.sh script, you can also set the
following flags:

The status of the agent should be Running .
If you have trouble with the installation, refer to the
Troubleshooting page.
Install the agent by using the Google Cloud console
Note: First verify that all conditions are met in the Before you
begin section.
You can install the Ops Agent on one or more Compute Engine VMs by using the
Google Cloud console from the Cloud Monitoring or Compute Engine pages.
Cloud Monitoring
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page:
Go to VM Instances
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
The List view on the Inventory tab on the dashboard lists all VMs and
includes a status column for your agent, as shown in the following screenshot:
The Agent column reports the following values:
Not detected : Either you don't have an agent installed or it is
not running. If you aren't sure if you've installed an agent, then you
can query for the installed version . If you've installed
the agent, then you can restart the agent .
If you've installed and started the Ops Agent but the status remains
Not detected , then the agent might not have started correctly or
is unable to send metrics.
To troubleshoot start-up problems, see Agent is installed but not
running .
To troubleshoot metric-ingestion problems, see Troubleshoot data
ingestion . The general
agent-diagnostics script
and health checks
might also be helpful.
Ops Agent : You are running the Ops Agent.
If you don't see a green checkmark beside the entry, then there is an
agent upgrade available, based on the detected operating system of your VM.
When you hover over the Ops Agent indicator in the table, you see information
about the version of the Ops Agent. If you are running an older version, you
also see a recommendation to upgrade your agent.
Pending : The Ops Agent is being installed or upgraded.
If the agent installation remains Pending for more than 10 minutes,
then there might be a problem in applying the Ops Agent OS policy or
starting the agent. For troubleshooting
information, see
Agent diagnostics tool for automatic installation policies .
Agent installation failed : Installation of the Ops Agent failed.
For troubleshooting information, see Agent
fails to
install .
Not Collecting Telemetry : Installation of the Ops Agent succeeded, but
the agent isn't yet sending telemetry.
It usually takes about 10 minutes for
telemetry to flow from a new agent. You can refresh the page to update the
status. If this status persists for longer than 10 minutes, it might
indicate a problem with the ingestion of the telemetry. For more information,
see Agent is installed but not
running .
Legacy Agent : You are running the legacy Monitoring or the
Logging agent.
See Migrating from the legacy agents to the
Ops Agent
for information on transitioning to the Ops Agent.
Not applicable : This VM is not a supported platform for running the agent.
VM Stopped : The VM is not running, so the agent's status is not known.
You can install the Ops Agent by doing the following:
Select the VM instances on which you want to install agents.
Click the Install/Update Ops Agent option on the Instances table.
You can also install or update the Ops Agent from
the VM Details page for a specific VM.
When possible, the agent is installed by using an Ops Agent OS policy.
For more information, see
Manage VMs covered by the Ops Agent OS policy .
Ops Agent OS policies aren't supported on all versions of all operating
systems. In this case, clicking Install/Update Ops Agent provides
a series of commands to run in Cloud Shell.
The Ops Agent collects both metrics and logs by default. You can change
this default behavior by
configuring the Ops Agent .
Compute Engine
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page:
Go to VM instances
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Compute Engine .
Click the name of the VM on which you want to install the agent.
Click the Observability tab.
Click Install Ops Agent .
When possible, the agent is installed by using an Ops Agent OS policy.
For more information, see

If the agent installation remains Pending for more than 10 minutes,
then there might be a problem in applying the Ops Agent OS policy or
starting the agent. For troubleshooting
information, see
Agent diagnostics tool for automatic installation policies .
Verify that the Ops Agent is running
To verify that the Ops Agent is running, you can use either of the following:
VM Instances dashboard :
This dashboard lets you view the agent installation status across your VM fleet.
However, the status might be inaccurate if the VM lacks necessary access scopes
or if the associated service account has insufficient IAM roles.
gcpdiag :
gcpdiag provides more reliable and robust information about
agent status than the VM Instances dashboard,
verifying both agent installation and transmission of telemetry from the VM.
Using gcpdiag has some
prerequisites ,
it provides a better way to monitor agent status.
Use VM Instances dashboard
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page:
Go to VM Instances
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
The List view on the Inventory tab on the dashboard lists all VMs and

Optional tasks
This section describes how to perform common maintenance tasks.
Configure an HTTP proxy
If you use an HTTP proxy for proxying requests to the Logging and
Monitoring APIs, do the following:
Linux
Edit the following configuration file (create the file if it doesn't already
exist):
/etc/systemd/system.conf
Add the following to the file:
DefaultEnvironment="HTTP_PROXY=http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port " "HTTPS_PROXY=http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port " "NO_PROXY=http://metadata.google.internal" # Skip proxy for the local Metadata Server.
Reload the environment variables:
sudo systemctl daemon - reload
Restart the agent by running the following command on your VM instance:
sudo systemctl restart google-cloud-ops-agent"*"
Windows
If you use an HTTP proxy, run the following command from an
administrator command prompt. This sets the
HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY
environment variables so that the agent can send data using outbound HTTPS:
setx HTTP_PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m
setx HTTPS_PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m
setx no_proxy "metadata.google.internal,169.254.169.254" /m

Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges by right-clicking the
PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator .
Run the following PowerShell command:
googet -noconfirm remove google-cloud-ops-agent
VMs without remote package access
Installing the Ops Agent requires access to
remote package repositories, for both the agent package and (on Linux) its
dependencies.
If you are using VPC-SC or a private network,
the network configuration might also affect your ability to install agent
dependencies from upstream repositories. The agent packages themselves are
accessible by using Private Google
Access . This can be configured
following Enable Private Google
Access .
If your VM host's security policy denies access to remote package repositories,
we recommend creating a custom VM
image with the
agent pre-installed and disabling package management in that image.
