Use agent policies (GA)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You create and manage agent policies by using the
gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies command
group in the Google Cloud CLI or the
ops-agent-policy Terraform module .
Agent policies use the
VM Manager suite of tools in
Compute Engine to manage OS policies ,
which can automate the deployment and maintenance of software configurations
like the
Ops Agent. These policies can't be applied to the legacy
Monitoring agent or the legacy Logging agent.
The GA agent policies use
OS policy assignment
resources in the OS Config API. Although there is a general gcloud CLI
command group for managing OS policy assignments,
gcloud compute os-config os-policy-assignments , the
gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies command group is designed specifically for the agent
policies described in this document.
Note:
This document describes the
GA agent policies. Agent policies are also available in a beta release.
For information about the differences between the
two releases and about converting beta agent policies to GA agent policies,
see Overview of agent
policies for the Ops Agent.
Before you begin
The ops-agent-policy Terraform module is built on top of the
gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies commands from the Google Cloud SDK. For information about how Terraform works, see
Using Terraform .
Before using the Google Cloud CLI or the Terraform module to create agent
policies, complete the following steps:
If you are going to use the gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies commands and if
you haven't done so already, then install the
Google Cloud CLI .
If you are going to use the Terraform module, then do the following:
For information about installing Terraform, see Install and configure
Terraform .
Cloud Shell has Terraform already installed.
Clone the terraform-google-cloud-operations repository, which
contains the ops-agent-policy module:
git clone https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-cloud-operations
Download and run the prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script to
enable the required APIs and to set the proper permissions for using the
Google Cloud CLI or Terraform.
For information about the script, see The prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh
script .
Note: The prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script is designed to run on Linux. If you're
using a machine on a different operating system, then run the script from
Cloud Shell .
Uninstall the legacy Monitoring agent and Logging agent
If you're creating a policy for the Ops Agent, ensure that your VMs
don't have the legacy Logging agent or Monitoring agent installed on them. Running the
Ops Agent and the legacy agents on the same VM can cause ingestion of
duplicate logs or a conflict in metrics ingestion. If necessary,
uninstall the Monitoring agent
and uninstall the
Logging agent before creating a policy to install the Ops Agent.
Verify that the OS Config agent is installed
You might need to manually install and configure the OS Config agent on
VMs that predate OS Config. For information about manually installing
and verifying the OS Config agent, see the
VM Manager verification checklist .
Find values for operating-system information
If you want to apply agent policies to specific operating systems
or versions, you need to know the values that OS Config uses to refer
to them.
To find values for the osShortName and osVersion fields for a VM, use
the following commands:
gcloud compute instances os-inventory describe INSTANCE_NAME \
--zone ZONE | grep "^ShortName: "
gcloud compute instances os-inventory describe INSTANCE_NAME \
--zone ZONE | grep "^Version: "
These commands require the OS Config agent to be installed on the VM.
Create an agent policy to manage the Ops Agent
Command-line
To create an agent policy, use the
gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies create command.
This command has the following structure:
gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies create POLICY_ID \
--zone ZONE \
--file path/to/policy-description-file.yaml \
--project PROJECT_ID
When using this command, replace the variables as follows:
POLICY_ID is a name for your policy.
ZONE is a Compute Engine zone. Agent policies are applied only to VMs in
the specified zone; to apply a policy in multiple zones, you must create
multiple policies.
path/to/policy-description-file.yaml is the path to a YAML file that describes the policy.
For information about the structure of this file, see
Describe agent policies .
PROJECT_ID is the ID of your Google Cloud project.
For information about the other commands in the command group and
the available options, see the
gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies documentation.
Describe agent policies
You provide policy information to the gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies create by
creating a YAML file that describes the policy and passing that file to the
command as the value of the --file
option.
This section describes the structure of the policy-description file.
For additional information, see
Example policy-description files .
Format of the YAML policy-description file
The description file for an agent policy must include two field groups:
agentsRule , which tells the agent policy whether to install or remove
the Ops Agent, and specifies the version of the Ops Agent to operate on.
instanceFilter , which describes the VMs on which the apply the policy.
Structure of the agentsRule field group
The agentsRule field group has the following structure:
agentsRule :
packageState : installed|removed
version : latest|2.*.*|2. x . y
The packageState field tells the policy the intended state of the
Ops Agent. The valid values are installed and removed .
The version field indicates the version of the Ops Agent to install or
remove. You can specify the following values:
latest is the most recent version of the Ops Agent.
2.*.* is the most recent release of major version 2 of the Ops Agent.
2. x . y indicates a specific release of major version 2.
For information about the available versions of the Ops Agent, see
the agent's GitHub repository .
Structure of the instanceFilter field group
The instanceFilter field group indicates the VMs in a zone to which the
filter applies. This field group is a YAML representation of the
InstanceFilter
structure used by the OSPolicyAssignment resource in the OS Config API.
The instanceFilter field group has one of the following structures:
To apply the agent policy to all VMs in a zone, use the following:
instanceFilter :
all : True
If you use the all: True filter, then you can't specify
any other criteria.
To apply the agent policy to a specific set of VMs in a zone, describe
the VMs by using a combination of any of the following:
Labels on the VM, either for inclusion or exclusion:
inclusionLabels:
exclusionLabels:
Operating system: inventories:
For example, the following filter applies the agent policy to the VMs
with the specified operating systems that have the label "env=prod"
and don't have the label "app=web":
instanceFilter :
inclusionLabels :
- labels :
env : prod
exclusionLabels :
- labels :
app : web
inventories :
- osShortName : rhel
osVersion : '7.*'
- osShortName : debian
osVersion : '11'
For information about finding the operating-system values, see
Find operating system information .
Terraform
To create a fully customized agent policy, use the
ops-agent-policy module in the modules
directory of the terraform-google-cloud-operations repository.
This module requires the same information that the
gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies create command requires.
For a description of all the fields used to describe an agent policy,
select the Command-line tab.
The examples directory in the
terraform-google-cloud-operations repository contains files that
provide many of the variables needed by the ops-agent-policy module
for you. For more information, see
Example policy configurations .
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform
configuration, see Basic Terraform
commands . For information about how Terraform works, see
Using Terraform .
Verify the status of agent policies
This section describes how to check the status of created policies
and the installation of the Ops Agent. This information can also help with
troubleshooting your agent policies.
Compute Engine OS policies page
The Compute Engine OS policies page provides information about
the agent policies that manage the Ops Agent and about VMs on the
VM instances tab. For example:
The State column indicates whether a policy was successfully
installed ("Compliant"), in progress ("Pending"), possibly failed
("Unknown"), or missing ("No policies").
The VM monitored column indicates whether the Ops Agent
is being managed by the OS Config ("Monitored") or not ("Not monitored").
If a policy is "Compliant" but the VM shows "Not monitored", then
there might be a problem installing the Ops Agent. You might, for
example, have a legacy agent already
installed .
In the Google Cloud console, go to the OS policies page:
Go to OS policies
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose
subheading is Compute Engine .
The VM instances on the Compute Engine OS policies tab
shows information about agents managed by all OS policies in your
Google Cloud project. These policies are labeled goog-ops-agent-policy .
The goog-ops-agent-policy indicator includes several types of policies:
Policies created by using the gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies commands.
Policies created for you if you requested
Ops Agent installation
when you created the VM .
Policies created by using Terraform to manage the Ops Agent.
To distinguish between policies, use the
OS policy assignments tab on the page
to see the policy IDs for all the policy assignments in your
Google Cloud project.
This VM monitored column doesn't reflect the installation of
the Ops Agent by other means, like manual installation or by
beta agent policies .
Cloud Monitoring VM Instances page
The VM Instances page in Cloud Monitoring includes an
Agent column that lists the agent installed on each VM, and for the
Ops Agent, includes an indicator for installed agents that are older than
the latest version.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page:
Go to VM Instances
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Example policy configurations
This section describes examples for setting up agent policies when using
either the Google Cloud SDK or Terraform.
Command-line
Example policy-description files
This section provides some examples of YAML policy-description files for
a variety of scenarios. The examples assume that you put the
YAML in a file named agent-policy-description.yaml and that
you create the policy in the us-central1-a zone by using a command
like the following:
gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies create POLICY_ID \
--zone us-central1-a \
--file agent-policy-description.yaml \
--project PROJECT_ID
Install on all VMs
To install the latest version of the Ops Agent on all VMs in the
us-central1-a zone, use the following policy description:
agentsRule :
packageState : installed
version : latest
instanceFilter :
all : True
Remove from all VMs
To remove the latest version of the Ops Agent on all VMs in the
us-central1-a zone, use the following policy description:
agentsRule :
packageState : removed
version : latest
instanceFilter :
all : True
Install on VMs based on labels
To install the latest version of the Ops Agent on all VMs in the
us-central1-a zone with the label "env=prod" or "app=web",
use the following policy description:
agentsRule :
packageState : installed
version : latest
instanceFilter :
inclusionLabels :
- labels :
env : prod
- labels :
app : web
When you specify multiple labels: entries for inclusion or exclusion, a VM
matches if any of the labels is present; that is, the sets of labels
for inclusion or exclusion are matched as a logical OR operation,
not a logical AND operation.
Install on VMs based on other labels
To install the latest version of the Ops Agent on all VMs in the
us-central1-a zone running Debian 11, except those with the labels "env=prod"
and "app=web6", use the following policy description:
agentsRule :
packageState : installed
version : latest
instanceFilter :
exclusionLabels :
- labels :
env : prod
app : web6
inventories :
- osShortName : debian
osVersion : '11'
When you specify multiple key-value pairs under a single labels: entry
for inclusion or exclusion, a VM matches if all of the labels are present;
that is, the labels are matched as a logical AND operation, not a
logical OR operation.
Install on VMs based on operating system
To install the latest version 2 of the Ops Agent on all VMs running
Debian 11 or RHEL 7.* in the us-central1-a zone, use the following
policy description:
agentsRule :
packageState : installed
version : 2.*.*
instanceFilter :
inventories :
- osShortName : rhel
osVersion : '7.*'
- osShortName : debian
osVersion : '11'
Terraform
This section describes the examples in the examples directory
of the terraform-google-cloud-operations repository. These examples
contain files that configure many of the variables required by the
ops-agent-policy module for you. You can also copy and modify the
examples. For example, these examples all install the Ops Agent;
you can modify them to delete the agent instead.
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform
configuration, see Basic Terraform
commands .
Example: ops_agent_policy_install_all
This example installs the latest version of the Ops Agent on all
eligible VMs in your Google Cloud project.
When you run the terraform plan or
terraform apply command, you are prompted for the following
values:
PROJECT_ID : The ID of your Google Cloud project
Example: ops_agent_policy_install_all_in_region
This example installs the latest version of the Ops Agent on all
eligible VMs in a given region, like us-west1 . A region contains
multiple zones, in this case, us-west-1a , us-west-1b , and us-west-1c .
When you run the terraform plan or
terraform apply command, you are prompted for the following
values:
PROJECT_ID : The ID of your Google Cloud project
REGION : The region in which to install the agent on VMs
Example: ops_agent_policy_install_all_in_zone
This example installs the latest version of the Ops Agent on all
eligible VMs in a given zone, like us-central1-a .
When you run the terraform plan or
terraform apply command, you are prompted for the following
values:
PROJECT_ID : The ID of your Google Cloud project
ZONE : The zone in which to install the agent on VMs
Troubleshoot GA agent policies
This section provides information to help you resolve problems with
GA agent policies for the Ops Agent. The information described in
Verify the status of agent policies might also be
helpful.
The ops-agents policy commands fail
When a gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies command fails, the response shows a
validation error. Correct the errors by fixing the command arguments and
flags as suggested by the error message.
In addition to the validation errors, you might see errors that indicate the
following conditions:
Insufficient IAM permission
The OS Config API isn't enabled
The specified policy doesn't exist
The following sections describe these conditions in more detail.
Insufficient IAM permission
If a gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies command fails with a permission error, then
make sure you have run the prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script as described in
Before you begin
to set up the OS Config policy roles:
OSPolicyAssignment Admin
( roles/osconfig.osPolicyAssignmentAdmin ) :
Provides full access to OS policy assignments.
OSPolicyAssignment Editor
( roles/osconfig.osPolicyAssignmentEditor ) :
Allows users to get, update, and list OS policy assignments.
OSPolicyAssignment Viewer
( roles/osconfig.osPolicyAssignmentViewer ) :
Provides read-only access to get and list OS policy assignments.
For more information about the prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script, see
The prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script .
OS Config API isn't enabled
A sample error looks like the following:
API [osconfig.googleapis.com] not enabled on project PROJECT_ID .
Would you like to enable and retry (this will take a few minutes)?
(y/N)?
You can enter y to enable the API, or you can run the prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh
script, described in
Before you begin ,
to grant all the necessary permissions. If you enter y at the
prompt in the error message, then you still need to run the
prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script to set the needed permissions.
To verify that the OS Config API is enabled for the project, run the
following commands:
gcloud services list --project PROJECT_ID | grep osconfig.googleapis.com
The expected output follows:
osconfig.googleapis.com Cloud OS Config API
The policy already exists
A sample error looks like the following:
ALREADY_EXISTS: Requested entity already exists
This error means this policy already exists with the same name, project ID and
region. You can use the gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies describe command to confirm this.
The policy does not exist
A sample error looks like the following:
NOT_FOUND: Requested entity was not found
This error might meant that the policy was never created, the policy has been
deleted, or that the specified policy ID is incorrect. Make sure the
POLICY_ID used in a gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies describe , update or
delete command corresponds to an existing policy. To get a list of agent
policies, use the gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies list command.
The policy is created but seems to have no effect
OS Config agents are deployed to each Compute Engine instance to manage the
packages for the Logging and Monitoring agents.
The policy may seem to have no effect if the underlying OS Config agent isn't
installed.
Linux
To verify that the OS Config agent is installed, run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh instance-id \
--project project-id \
-- sudo systemctl status google-osconfig-agent
A sample output is:
google-osconfig-agent.service - Google OSConfig Agent
Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/google-osconfig-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset:
Active: active (running) since Wed 2020-01-15 00:14:22 UTC; 6min ago
Main PID: 369 (google_osconfig)
Tasks: 8 (limit: 4374)
Memory: 102.7M
CGroup: /system.slice/google-osconfig-agent.service
└─369 /usr/bin/google_osconfig_agent
Windows
To verify that the OS Config agent is installed, run the following steps:
Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open a PowerShell terminal, then run the following PowerShell command. You
don't need administrator privileges.
Get-Service google_osconfig_agent
A sample output is:
Status Name DisplayName
------ ---- -----------
Running google_osconfig_a… Google OSConfig Agent
If the OS Config agent is not installed, then you might be using an
operating system that doesn't support VM Manager. The
Compute Engine Operating system details document
indicates which VM Manager features are supported for each
Compute Engine operating system.
If the operating system supports VM Manager, then you
can install the OS Config agent manually.
The OS Config agent is installed but does not install the Ops Agent
To verify if there are any errors when the OS Config agent applies policies, you
can check the OS Config agent's log. This can be done either by using
Logs Explorer or using SSH or RDP to check individual Compute Engine
instances.
To view OS Config agent logs in
Logs Explorer ,
use the following filter:
resource . type = "gce_instance"
logId ( OSConfigAgent )
To view OS Config agent logs, do the following:
CentOS, RHEL, SLES, SUSE
Run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE_ID \
--project PROJECT_ID \
-- sudo cat /var/log/messages \
| grep "OSConfigAgent\|google-fluentd\|stackdriver-agent"
Debian, Ubuntu
Run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE_ID \
--project PROJECT_ID \
-- sudo cat /var/log/syslog \
| grep "OSConfigAgent\|google-fluentd\|stackdriver-agent"
Windows
Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open the Event Viewer app, then select
Windows Logs > Application , and search
for logs with Source equal to OSConfigAgent .
If there is an error connecting to the OS Config service, make sure you run the
prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script as described in
Before you begin
to set up the OS Config metadata.
To verify that the OS Config metadata is enabled, you can run the following
command:
gcloud compute project-info describe \
--project PROJECT_ID \
| grep "enable-osconfig\|enable-guest-attributes" -A 1
The expected output follows:
- key: enable-guest-attributes
value: 'TRUE'
- key: enable-osconfig
value: 'TRUE'
The Ops Agent is installed but not functioning properly
For more information about debugging Ops Agent problems, see
Troubleshoot the Ops Agent .
Enable debug-level logs for the OS Config agent
It can be useful to enable debug-level logging in the OS Config agent when
reporting an issue.
You can set the osconfig-log-level: debug metadata to enable debug-level
logging for the OS Config agent. The collected logs have more information to
help with the investigation.
To enable debug-level logging for the entire project, run the following command:
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata \
--project PROJECT_ID \
--metadata osconfig-log-level=debug
To enable debug-level logging for one VM, run the following command:
gcloud compute instances add-metadata INSTANCE_ID \
--project PROJECT_ID \
--metadata osconfig-log-level=debug
Helper scripts
This section provides additional information about the helper scripts
described in this document:
The prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script
The diagnose_policies.sh script
The prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script
After you download the prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script, you
can use the script to perform the following actions, based on the arguments
you provide:
Enable the Cloud Logging API, the Cloud Monitoring API, and the
OS Config API for the project.
If the OS Config API was not already enabled, it is enabled in
limited-feature mode, which is sufficient for managing agent policies.
For more information, see Pricing .
Grant the Identity and Access Management roles Logs Writer
( roles/logging.logWriter ) and
Monitoring Metric Writer
( roles/monitoring.metricWriter )
to the Compute Engine default service
account
so that the agents can write logs and metrics to the
Logging and Cloud Monitoring APIs.
Enable the OS Config metadata for the project so that the OS Config agent
on each VM is active.
Grant one of the following IAM roles to the non-owner users
user or service account needed to create and manage policies. Project
owners have full access to create and manage policies; all other users
or service accounts must be granted one of the following roles:
OSPolicyAssignment Admin
( roles/osconfig.osPolicyAssignmentAdmin ) :
Provides full access to OS policy assignments.
OSPolicyAssignment Editor
( roles/osconfig.osPolicyAssignmentEditor ) :
Allows users to get, update, and list OS policy assignments.
OSPolicyAssignment Viewer
( roles/osconfig.osPolicyAssignmentViewer ) :
Provides read-only access to get and list OS policy assignments.
When running the script, you can specify the OSPolicyAssignment roles as
admin , editor , or viewer . The script maps those values to the
roles/osconfig.osPolicyAssignment* role names.
The following examples show some common invocations for the script.
For more information, see the comments in the script itself.
To enable the APIs, grant the necessary roles to the default service account,
and enable the OS Config metadata for a project, run the script as follows:
bash prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh --project= PROJECT_ID
To additionally grant one of the OS Config roles to a user who does
not have the Owner ( roles/owner ) role on the project, run the script as
follows:
bash prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh --project= PROJECT_ID \
--iam-user= USER_EMAIL \
--iam-policy-access= [admin|editor|viewer]
To additionally grant one of the OS Config roles to a non-default
service account, run the script as follows:
bash prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh --project= PROJECT_ID \
--iam-service-account= SERVICE_ACCT_EMAIL \
--iam-policy-access= [admin|editor|viewer]
The diagnose_policies.sh script
Given a project ID, a Compute Engine instance ID,
a Compute Engine zone,
and the agent policy ID, the
diagnose_policies.sh script automatically collects
the necessary information to help diagnose issues with the policy:
The OS Config agent version
The underlying OS policy assignment
The OS policy assignments that are applicable to this
Compute Engine instance
A description of this Compute Engine instance
To invoke the script, run the following command:
bash diagnose_policies.sh --project-id= PROJECT_ID \
--gce-instance-id= INSTANCE_ID \
--policy-id= POLICY_ID \
--zone= ZONE
Pricing
The gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies commands are implemented by using
OS policy assignment
resources from VM Manager .
The prepare-for-ops-agents-policies.sh script, described in Before you begin , sets
up VM Manager in
limited-feature mode
( OSCONFIG_B ) ,
which is sufficient for creating and managing agent policies. There is no cost
to use VM Manager in limited mode.
If you have configured VM Manager in full-feature mode
( OSCONFIG_C ), then you might incur costs.
