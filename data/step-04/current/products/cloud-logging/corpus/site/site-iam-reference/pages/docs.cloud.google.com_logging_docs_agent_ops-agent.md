Ops Agent overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Ops Agent is the primary agent for collecting telemetry from your
Compute Engine instances. Combining the collection of logs, metrics, and
traces into a single process, the Ops Agent uses
Fluent Bit
for logs, which supports high-throughput logging, and the OpenTelemetry
Collector for
metrics and traces.
For information about installing the Ops Agent, see the following:
For Compute Engine instances, see
Installing the Ops Agent .
For Bare Metal Solution servers, see
Set up Ops Agent for Bare Metal Solution .
Ops Agent features
Overall features include:
Single download and installation/upgrade process.
Simple, unified, YAML-based configuration.
Support for standard Linux and Windows distros .
Proxy support.
Logging features
Logging features include:
Improved performance compared to the legacy Logging Agent:
High throughput capability, taking full advantage of multi-core architecture.
Efficient resource (e.g. memory, CPU) management.
Collecting logs from various sources :
Standard system logs ( /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages for Linux,
Windows Event Log) collected with no configuration.
File-based logs with customizable paths and refresh interval.
Journald daemon / systemd logs.
Logs over TCP protocol.
Logs over Forward protocol (used by Fluent Bit and Fluentd).
Flexible processing:
Parse text logs into structured logs: JSON-based and regular-expression-based parsing.
Modify
log entries by removing, renaming, or setting fields.
Exclude
logs based on labels and regular expressions.
Detect and concatenate multiline
language-exception logs from Java, Python, and Golang.
Third-party application support
Curated third-party application log integration that recognizes common app log
file paths and formats.
Monitoring features
Monitoring features include:
System metrics collected with no configuration. Metrics collected include:
cpu metrics
disk metrics
iis metrics (Windows only)
interface metrics
gpu metrics (Linux only)
memory metrics
mssql metrics (Windows only)
pagefile metrics (Windows
only)
swap metrics
network metrics
processes metrics
agent self metrics :
Third-party application support
Curated integrations for third-party application
metrics , which
collect common app metrics and offer sample dashboards and alert policies.
Collection of
Prometheus metrics from applications running on Compute Engine.
Collection of
OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) metrics and traces from applications
instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDKs .
Collection of
NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM) metrics .
Note: Some metrics are only available on VMs running on Linux. See detailed
metrics definition and whether they are Linux only in the agent
metrics page.
The Cloud Monitoring Metrics Management page provides information
that can help you control the amount you spend on billable metrics
without affecting observability. The Metrics Management page reports the
following information:
Ingestion volumes for both byte- and sample-based billing, across metric
domains and for individual metrics.
Data about labels and cardinality of metrics.
Number of reads for each metric.
Use of metrics in alerting policies and custom dashboards.
Rate of metric-write errors.
You can also use the Metrics Management page to
exclude unneeded metrics ,
eliminating the cost of ingesting them.
For more information about the Metrics Management page, see
View and manage metric usage .
Trace features
Trace features include:
Collection of OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) traces from
applications instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDKs .
Virtual machine instances
You can install the Ops Agent on Compute Engine instances.
To create a Compute Engine instance, see the
Compute Engine getting started guide .
Note:
The Ops Agent is not supported on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
instances or on-premises machines.
The following types of VM instances belong to managed services that implement
service-specific
Monitoring
support. Don't try to manually install or configure the Ops Agent on them:
App Engine standard has built-in
Monitoring support. Agents aren't needed.
App Engine flexible environment instances have pre-installed agents
with service-specific configurations.
Dataflow instances have
pre-installed
legacy
Monitoring agents with service-specific configurations.
Managed Service for Apache Spark instances prior to
image version 2.2 have pre-installed
legacy
Monitoring agents with service-specific configurations.
You can install the
Ops Agent on Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters
that use image version 2.2 and later to collect syslog logs and
host metrics. For more information, see
Managed Service for Apache Spark 2.2.x release versions .
Google Kubernetes Engine node instances:
GKE on
Google Cloud clusters are configured to
collect logs and metrics with
Logging and Monitoring by default. You
can also configure metric and log collection for existing container
clusters. For information, see
Configuring logging and
monitoring for GKE .
Google Distributed Cloud
instances have an integrated logging and monitoring solution that
collects status about system components. For information, see
Logging and monitoring .
Operating systems
The Ops Agent supports the following operating systems on compatible VM
instances. For information about Arm VM instances, see
Support for Compute Engine Arm VMs .
Linux operating systems
The agent supports the following Linux operating systems:
Note: To use Cloud Logging on VMs with Container-Optimized OS, follow
Using Cloud Logging with Container-Optimized OS instead.

If you install the Ops Agent, then you might be charged for the metrics,
logs, or traces that the agent sends to your Google Cloud project. For pricing
information, see Google Cloud Observability pricing .
To collect OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) traces, you must configure the
agent to collect traces from an instrumented application; for more
information, see Collect (OTLP) traces with the Ops Agent .
