Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) stores information about objects on the
network so that administrators and users can easily access this information.
For more information about AD DS, see the
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) documentation .
Prerequisites
To collect AD DS telemetry, you must
install the Ops Agent :
For metrics, install version 2.15.0 or higher.
For logs, install version 2.15.0 or higher.
This integration supports AD DS versions windows-server-2016 and windows-server-2019.
Configure your AD DS instance
By default, Active Directory Windows event logs and performance counters are enabled.
Configure the Ops Agent for AD DS
Following the guide to Configure the Ops
Agent , add the required elements
to collect telemetry from AD DS instances, and
restart the agent .
Example configuration
The following commands create the configuration to collect and ingest telemetry
for AD DS:
$ ErrorActionPreference = ' Stop '
# Create an empty config . yaml file if it doesn ' t exist .
$ configFilePath = ' C : \ Program Files \ Google \ Cloud Operations \ Ops Agent \ config \ config . yaml '
if ( - not ( Test - Path - Path $ configFilePath - PathType Leaf )) {
New - Item - ItemType File - Path $ configFilePath - Force | Out - Null
}
# Create a back up of the existing file so existing configurations are not lost .
Copy - Item - Path ' C : \ Program Files \ Google \ Cloud Operations \ Ops Agent \ config \ config . yaml ' - Destination ' C : \ Program Files \ Google \ Cloud Operations \ Ops Agent \ config \ config . yaml . bak '
# Configure the Ops Agent .
Add - Content ' C : \ Program Files \ Google \ Cloud Operations \ Ops Agent \ config \ config . yaml ' "

}
For these changes to take effect, you must restart the Ops Agent:
Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges by
right-clicking the PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator
To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command:
Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force
To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and
verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started:
Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent*
Configure logs collection
To ingest logs from AD DS, you must create a receiver for the logs
that AD DS produces and then create a pipeline for the new receiver.
To configure a receiver for your active_directory_ds logs, specify the following
fields:
Field
Default
Description
type
The value must be active_directory_ds .
What is logged
The logName is derived from
the receiver IDs specified in the configuration. Detailed fields inside the
LogEntry
are as follows.
The active_directory_ds logs contain the following fields in the LogEntry :
Field

Configure metrics collection
To ingest metrics from AD DS, you must create a receiver for the metrics
that AD DS produces and then create a pipeline for the new receiver.
This receiver does not
support the use of multiple instances in the configuration, for example, to
monitor multiple endpoints. All such instances write to the same time series,
and Cloud Monitoring has no way to distinguish among them.
To configure a receiver for your active_directory_ds metrics, specify the following
fields:
Field
Default
Description
collection_interval
60s
A time duration value, such as 30s or 5m .
type
The value must be active_directory_ds .
What is monitored
The following table provides the list of metrics that the Ops Agent collects
from the AD DS instance.

Verify the configuration
This section describes how to verify that you correctly configured the
AD DS receiver. It might take one or two
minutes for the Ops Agent to begin collecting telemetry.
To verify that AD DS logs are being sent to
Cloud Logging, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
segment
Logs Explorer page:
Go to Logs Explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Logging .
Enter the following query in the editor, and then click Run query :
resource.type="gce_instance"
log_id("active_directory_ds")
To verify that AD DS metrics are being sent to
Cloud Monitoring, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
leaderboard Metrics explorer page:
Go to Metrics explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
In the toolbar of the
query-builder pane, select the button whose name is either
code MQL or code PromQL .
Verify that PromQL is selected
in the Language toggle. The language toggle is in the same toolbar that
lets you format your query.
Enter the following query in the editor, and then click Run query :
{"workload.googleapis.com/active_directory.ds.bind.rate", monitored_resource="gce_instance"}
View dashboard
To view your AD DS metrics, you must have a chart or dashboard
configured.
The AD DS integration includes one or more dashboards for you.
Any dashboards are automatically installed after you configure the
integration and the Ops Agent has begun collecting metric data.
You can also view static previews of dashboards without
installing the integration.
To view an installed dashboard, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the dashboard Dashboards page:
Go to Dashboards
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Select the Dashboard List tab, and then choose the
Integrations category.
Click the name of the dashboard you want to view.
If you have configured an integration but the dashboard has not been
installed, then check that the Ops Agent is running. When there is no
metric data for a chart in the dashboard, installation of the dashboard fails.
After the Ops Agent begins collecting metrics, the dashboard is installed
for you.
To view a static preview of the dashboard, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Integrations
page:
Go to Integrations
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Click the Compute Engine deployment-platform filter.
Locate the entry for
AD DS
and click View Details .
Select the Dashboards tab to see a static preview. If the
dashboard is installed, then you can navigate to it by clicking
View dashboard .
For more information about dashboards in Cloud Monitoring, see
Dashboards and charts .
For more information about using the Integrations page, see
Manage integrations .
Install alerting policies
Alerting policies instruct Cloud Monitoring to notify you when
specified conditions occur.
The AD DS integration includes one or more alerting policies for
you to use.
You can view and install
these alerting policies from the Integrations page in
Monitoring.
To view the descriptions of available alerting policies and
install them, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Integrations
page:
Go to Integrations
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Locate the entry for
AD DS
and click View Details .
Select the Alerts tab. This tab provides descriptions of
available alerting policies and provides an interface for installing
them.
Install alerting policies. Alerting policies need
to know where to send notifications that the alert has been
triggered, so they require information from you for installation.
To install alerting policies, do the following:
From the list of available alerting policies,
select those that you want to install.
In the Configure notifications section, select one or
more notification channels. You have the option to disable the
use of notification channels, but if you do, then your alerting
policies fire silently. You can check their status in
Monitoring, but you receive no notifications.
For more information about notification channels,
see Manage
notification channels .
Click Create Policies .
For more information about alerting policies in Cloud Monitoring, see
Introduction to alerting .
For more information about using the Integrations page, see
Manage integrations .
