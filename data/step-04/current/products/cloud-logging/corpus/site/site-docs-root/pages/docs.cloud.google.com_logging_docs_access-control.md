Access control with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document helps you understand how Cloud Logging uses
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions to control access
to Logging resources. Your IAM roles
determine whether you can perform actions like create log sinks or
log buckets, read log data stored in a log bucket, or access pages like the
Logs Explorer . If you issue a
Logging API or Google Cloud CLI
command, then your IAM roles determine whether you have
the permission to run the command.
Overview
Your IAM roles determine what actions you can perform
within Logging. A role is a collection of
permissions . When you grant a role to a principal,
you grant them all the permissions that the role contains. You can grant
multiple roles to the same principal.
IAM roles are granted on a resource, such as a Google Cloud project,
folder, bucket, or organization. For example, you might grant a principal the
Logs Viewer role ( roles/logging.viewer ) on a particular Google Cloud project.
The Predefined roles and
Logging roles sections of this page provide
comprehensive information about Logging roles and permissions.
Other sections of this page provide information about roles or permissions
for specific use cases.
The remainder of this section summarizes how you can grant a principal
access to log buckets or grant them access to only some of the log entries
in a log bucket. It also describes how you can restrict access
to some LogEntry fields.
Note: Log scopes aren't used for access control.
A log scope is used to define what resources to search for log data.
Your IAM roles on those resources determine whether you have
the permissions required to view the log data.
Grant access to log buckets
The Logs Viewer role ( roles/logging.viewer ) lets a principal access all
log data stored in the _Required and _Default log buckets, except for
data access logs. If a principal needs access to data access logs, then
grant the Private Logs Viewer role ( roles/logging.privateLogViewer ).
For custom log buckets, you can grant access to the _AllLogs view or to
a custom log view. Logging automatically creates the
_AllLogs view, which includes all log entries in the log bucket. To grant
access to a log view, you add an IAM binding to the
IAM policy attached to the log view or to the project. To
learn more, see
Control access to a log view .
Logging also supports tags on log buckets, which can help
you understand your costs. You can also use tags to prevent a user from
deleting a log bucket. To learn more, see
Use tags to manage access to log buckets .
Grant access to some log entries in a log bucket
To grant a principal access to only some of the log entries stored in a
log bucket, create a log view and then grant the principal access to the
log view. For
example, you might create a log view on the _Default log bucket that only
includes log entries whose resource type is a Compute Engine instance.
To learn more about creating log views and the different strategies that you can
use to grant access to the view, see
Configure log views on a log bucket .
Restrict access to specific LogEntry fields
To restrict access to specific fields in the LogEntry data
structure, configure field-level access controls on the log bucket that stores
your data. For example, for your _Default log bucket, you can place
a restriction on the jsonPayload of the LogEntry data structure,
and then grant your administrators access to that field. To learn more,
see Configure field-level access controls .
You can't restrict fields on a log bucket that has been upgraded to use
Observability Analytics. Similarly, if a log bucket contains a restricted field, then you
can't upgrade it to use Observability Analytics.
Predefined roles
IAM provides predefined roles to grant granular access to
specific Google Cloud resources and prevent unwanted access to other
resources. Google Cloud creates and maintains these roles and automatically
updates their permissions as necessary, such as when Logging adds
new features.
The following table lists the predefined roles for Logging. For
each role, the table displays the role title, description, contained
permissions, and the lowest-level resource type where the roles can be granted.
You can grant the predefined roles at the Google Cloud project level or, in
most cases, any type higher in the
resource hierarchy .
To restrict the Logs View Accessor role to a log view on a bucket, use
resource attributes for IAM Conditions .
To get a list of all
individual permissions contained in a role, see
Getting the role metadata .

The following sections provide additional information to help you decide
which roles apply to your principals' use cases.
Logging roles
To let a user perform all actions in Logging, grant the
Logging Admin ( roles/logging.admin ) role.
To let a user create and modify logging configurations,
grant the Logs Configuration Writer ( roles/logging.configWriter ) role.
This role lets you create or modify any of the following:
Log sinks
Log buckets
Log views
Linked data sets
Log scopes
Analytics views
This role isn't sufficient to create log-based metrics or
log-based alerting policies . For information about the
roles required for these tasks, see
Permissions for log-based metrics and
Permissions for log-based alerting policies .
To let a user read logs in the _Required and _Default buckets
or to use the Logs Explorer and Observability Analytics pages,
grant one of the following roles:
For access to all logs in the _Required bucket, and access to the
_Default view on the _Default bucket, grant the
Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) role.
For access to all logs in the _Required and _Default buckets,
including data access logs,
grant the Private Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.privateLogViewer ) role.
To let a user read logs in all log views that are in a project, grant them
the IAM role of roles/logging.viewAccessor on the project.
To let a user only read logs in a specific log view, you have two options:
Create an IAM policy for the log view, and then add an
IAM binding to that policy which grants the principal
access to the log view.
Grant the principal the IAM role of
roles/logging.viewAccessor on the project that contains the log view,
but attach an
IAM condition to
restrict the grant to the specific log view.
For information about creating log views and granting access, see
Configure log views on a log bucket .
To give a user access to restricted LogEntry fields, if any,
in a given log bucket, grant the
Logs Field Accessor ( roles/logging.fieldAccessor ) role.
For more information, see
Configure field-level access .
To let a user write logs by using the Logging API, grant
the Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) role.
This role doesn't grant viewing permissions.
To let the service account of a sink route logs to a bucket in a
different Google Cloud project, grant the service account the
Logs Bucket Writer ( roles/logging.bucketWriter ) role.
For instructions about granting permissions to a service account, see
Set destination permissions .
Project-level roles
Caution: The following basic roles
include thousands of permissions across all Google Cloud services. Use these
roles carefully, or consider using their corresponding Logging
predefined roles .
To give view access to most Google Cloud services,
grant the Viewer ( roles/viewer ) role.
This role includes all permissions granted by the
Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) role.
To give editor access to most Google Cloud services,
grant the Editor ( roles/editor ) role.
This role includes all permissions granted by the
Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) role, and the permissions to
write log entries, delete logs, and create log-based metrics. However,
this role doesn't let users create
sinks, read Data Access audit logs that are in the _Default bucket,
or read logs that are in user-defined log buckets.
To give full access to most Google Cloud services,
grant the Owner ( roles/owner ) role.
Granting roles
To learn how to grant a role to a principal, see
Granting, changing, and revoking access .
You can grant multiple roles to the same user. To get a list of the permissions
contained in a role, see
Getting the role metadata .
If you're trying to access a Google Cloud resource and lack the necessary
permissions, then contact the principal who is listed as the Owner for the
resource.
Custom roles
To create a custom role with Logging permissions, do the
following:
For a role granting permissions for the Logging API, choose
permissions from API permissions , then follow the
instructions to
create a custom role .
For a role granting permissions to use the Logs Explorer, choose from
permission groups in Console permissions , then
follow the instructions to
create a custom role .
For a role granting permissions to use gcloud logging , see the
Command-line permissions section on this page, then
follow the instructions to
create a custom role .
For more information about custom roles, see
Understanding IAM custom roles .
Cloud Logging permissions
The following table is a partial list of the permissions needed for specific
features of Cloud Logging. This table can help you identify the permissions
that you need to use pages like the
Logs Explorer .
In the table, a.b.{x,y} means a.b.x and a.b.y .
Console activity
Required permissions
Minimal read-only access
logging.logEntries.list
logging.logs.list
logging.logServiceIndexes.list

View log-based metrics
logging.logMetrics.{list, get}
View sinks
logging.sinks.{list, get}
View logs usage
logging.usage.get
Download logs
logging.logEntries.{list, download}
Only one of these permissions is necessary to download logs. Roles
containing the permissions to download logs must be granted at a
project-level. You can't download logs if a role containing these
permissions is granted in the IAM policy file of a
log view.
List and view log scopes
logging.logScopes.{get, list}
View the default log scope
observability.scopes.get
Exclude logs
logging.exclusions.{list, create, get, update, delete}
When creating a custom role that includes permissions to
manage exclusion filters, add the logging.sinks.*
permissions to the role instead of adding the
logging.exclusions.* permissions.
Create and use sinks
logging.sinks.{list, create, get, update, delete}
When creating a sink, you must also grant the service account
an IAM role that lets it write log entries to the
destination. For more information, see
Set destination permissions .
After your log entries have been routed to a supported destination,
access to the log entries is controlled entirely by
IAM permissions and roles on the destination.
Create log-based alerts
See Roles required to create and
use log-based alerting policies .
Create log-based metrics
logging.logMetrics.{list, create, get, update, delete}
For information about other IAM roles that you
need to create and use log-based metrics, see
Roles required to create and
use log-based metrics .
Save and use private queries
logging.queries.usePrivate
logging.queries.{listShared,getShared}
Save and use shared queries
logging.queries.{share, getShared, updateShared, deleteShared,
listShared}
Use recent queries
logging.queries.{create, list}
Create and manage log scopes
logging.logScopes.{create, delete, get, list, update}
Set and manage the default log scope
observability.scopes.{get, update}
Create and manage analytics views
observability.analyticsViews.{create, delete, get, list, update}
Create and manage linked datasets
logging.links.{create, delete, get, list}
You might need additional IAM roles to query the
linked dataset. For example, these permissions don't grant you access
to the BigQuery interface. For more information, see
BigQuery: Access control with IAM .
Permissions for the command-line
gcloud logging commands are
controlled by IAM permissions.
To use any of the gcloud logging commands, principals must have the
serviceusage.services.use permission.
A principal must also have the IAM role that corresponds to the
log's resource, and to the use case. For details, see
command-line interface permissions .
Roles required to create and use log-based metrics
Following is a summary of the common roles and permissions that a principal
needs to access log-based metrics:
The Logs Configuration Writer
( roles/logging.configWriter ) role lets principals list, create, get,
update, and delete log-based metrics.
The Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) role
contains permissions to view existing metrics. Specifically, a principal
needs the logging.logMetrics.get and logging.logMetrics.list permissions
to view existing metrics.
The Monitoring Viewer
( roles/monitoring.viewer ) role contains the permissions to read
TimeSeries data. Specifically, a principal needs the
monitoring.timeSeries.list permission to read time series data.
The Logging Admin ( roles/logging.admin ),
Project Editor ( roles/editor ), and
Project Owner ( roles/owner ) roles
contain the permissions to create log-based metrics. Specifically, a
principal needs the logging.logMetrics.create permission to create
log-based metrics.
Note: To secure private logs data, such as Data Access audit logs and
Access Transparency audit logs, from unauthorized access, ensure that principals are
granted the minimal permissions they need to do their jobs. For example,
principals that have the Project Editor
( roles/editor ) role can create log-based metrics with labels that can extract
sensitive information.
Roles required to create and use log-based alerting policies
This section describes the roles that you need to create
log-based alerting policies, notification channels , and
notification rules . Notification channels specify how Cloud Monitoring
notifies you. A notification rule describes how to match
incoming log entries to the alerting policy.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create log-based alerting policies, to create notification channels, and to create the associated Logging notification rules ,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on your project:
Monitoring AlertPolicy Editor ( roles/monitoring.alertPolicyEditor )
Monitoring NotificationChannel Editor ( roles/monitoring.notificationChannelEditor )
Logs Configuration Writer ( roles/logging.configWriter )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to create log-based alerting policies, to create notification channels, and to create the associated Logging notification rules . To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to create log-based alerting policies, to create notification channels, and to create the associated Logging notification rules :
monitoring.alertPolicies.create
monitoring.notificationChannels.create
logging.notificationRules.create
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Additional required roles for Google Cloud CLI users
To get the permission that
you need to create an alerting policy by using the Google Cloud CLI,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Service Usage Consumer ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer )
IAM role on your project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains the
serviceusage.services.use
permission,
which is required to
create an alerting policy by using the Google Cloud CLI.
You might also be able to get
this permission
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
