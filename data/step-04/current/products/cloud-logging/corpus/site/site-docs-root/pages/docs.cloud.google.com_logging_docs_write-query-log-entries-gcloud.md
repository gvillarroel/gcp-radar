Write and query log entries with the gcloud CLI
This document introduces you to some of the capabilities of Cloud Logging
and shows you how to do the following:
Write log entries by using the Google Cloud CLI.
List log entries by using the gcloud CLI.
List log entries by using the Logging API.
View and query log entries by using the Logs Explorer.
Before you begin
You must have a Google Cloud project with billing enabled to complete this
quickstart.
If you don't have a Google Cloud project, or if you don't have
billing enabled for your Google Cloud project, then do the following:
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
If you're using an existing project for this guide,
verify that you have the
permissions required to complete this guide . If you created a new project,
then you already have the required permissions.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .

then you already have the required permissions.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create, list, and delete log entries,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Logging Admin ( roles/logging.admin )
IAM role on your project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
The Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) and Logs Viewer
( roles/logging.viewer ) roles contain the permissions to create and list
log entries. To delete log entries, grant the Logging Admin
( roles/logging.admin ) role, which contains the permissions to create, list,
and delete log entries. Note that the Logging Admin
( roles/logging.admin ) role also grants permissions to perform all actions
in Logging.
Write log entries by using the gcloud CLI
Logging supports log entries with structured and unstructured
data. Structured data consists of a JSON data structure; for example,
{"weather": "partly cloudy"} . Unstructured data
is a string of characters; for example, "A simple entry" .
In the next steps, you use the gcloud CLI to write a log entry with
unstructured data and a log entry with structured data.
The gcloud CLI provide a command-line interface to
the Cloud Logging API.
Write a log entry with unstructured data to the log my-test-log , run
the gcloud logging write command:
gcloud logging write my - test - log "A simple entry."
After the command completes, you see the message: Created log entry .
Write a log entry with structured data to the log my-test-log :
gcloud logging write -- payload - type = json my - test - log '{ "message": "My second entry", "weather": "partly cloudy"}'
When you write a log entry with structured data, you must include
--payload-type=json . If you omit this field, then Logging
interprets the payload as unstructured data.
If the log my-test-log doesn't exist, then Logging creates the
log when the log entry is received.
List log entries by using the gcloud CLI
You can retrieve log entries from Logging and display them
by using the gcloud CLI. For example, to retrieve and display the log
entries with a resource type of global , run the following command:
gcloud logging read "resource.type=global"
The command returns a result similar to the following:
---
insertId : jpj9zjf73t1mn
jsonPayload :
message : My second entry
weather : partly cloudy
logName : projects / myloggingproject / logs / my - test - log
receiveTimestamp : '2018-11-01T18:39:31.114507977Z'
resource :
labels :
project_id : myloggingproject
type : global
timestamp : '2018-11-01T18:39:31.114507977Z'
---
insertId : vd4m1if7h7u1a
logName : projects / myloggingproject / logs / my - test - log
receiveTimestamp : '2018-11-01T18:39:19.718100792Z'
resource :
labels :
project_id : myloggingproject
type : global
textPayload : A simple entry
timestamp : '2018-11-01T18:39:19.718100792Z'
For information about reading logs, see the
gcloud logging read reference documentation.
List log entries by using APIs Explorer
To run Logging API methods without writing any code, see
Using the APIs Explorer . To read a list of log entries
from Logging, do the following:
Go to the API reference page for the entries.list API method:
Go to entries.list API page
Configure and run the API command:
Replace PROJECT_ID in the following text:
"resourceNames": [
"projects/ PROJECT_ID "
],
"filter": "resource.type=global",
"orderBy": "timestamp desc"
Copy the updated text from the previous step, and paste it into
the Request body field of APIs Explorer.
Click Execute .
The method returns a response similar to the following:
{
"entries": [
{
"textPayload": "A simple entry",
"insertId": "vd4m1if7h7u1a",
"resource": {
"type": "global",
"labels": {
"project_id": "myloggingproject"
}
},
"timestamp": "2018-11-01T18:39:19.718100792Z",
"logName": "projects/myloggingproject/logs/my-test-log",
"receiveTimestamp": "2018-11-01T18:39:19.718100792Z"
},
{
"insertId": "jpj9zjf73t1mn",
"jsonPayload": {
"message": "My second entry",
"weather": "partly cloudy"
},
"resource": {
"type": "global",
"labels": {
"project_id": "myloggingproject"
}
},
"timestamp": "2018-11-01T18:39:31.114507977Z",
"logName": "projects/myloggingproject/logs/my-test-log",
"receiveTimestamp": "2018-11-01T18:39:31.114507977Z"
}
]
}
View log entries in the Logs Explorer
To view log entries in the Google Cloud console, you can use the
Logs Explorer. Most Google Cloud projects store a large number of logs;
you can select certain log entries by writing a query.
To view the log entries that you wrote using the Logs Explorer, do the
following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
segment
Logs Explorer page:
Go to Logs Explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Logging .
Ensure your Google Cloud project is selected in the Google Cloud
navigation bar. If necessary, use the Google Cloud project drop-down list
to select your Google Cloud project.
In the Resource menu, select Global .
If you don't see the Global menu option or if you don't see your log
entries, then wait a few minutes and refresh the page. It can take a
few minutes for Logging to receive log entries.
To view the details of a log entry, click its chevron_right
Menu .
The first log entry has its data stored in textPayload . The second log
entry contains structured data that is stored in jsonPayload . The
structured payload contains the keys message and weather .
Note: When message is a key for a structured log entry,
Logging uses it as the summary of the log entry when the
entry isn't expanded.
For information about the data format of log entries, see the
LogEntry type .
Query log entries in the Logs Explorer
You can query log entries by using the query editor and, with structured logs,
by the key and value. For example, to display all log entries that contain the
text simple , do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
segment
Logs Explorer page:
Go to Logs Explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Logging .
In the Resource menu, select Global .
In the query editor, enter the string simple in quotation marks.
The logs display shows only the log entry A simple entry.
After you have viewed your log, remove the query string you added and
click Run query . Both log entries reappear in the display.
To display all log entries with structured data that have a key of weather
where the value field contains partly , do the following:
The query editor contains the line resource.type="global" .
Enter the following command:
jsonPayload . weather : partly
Click Run query . The result is the single log entry
My second entry .
Logs Explorer also offers saved, suggested, and recent queries.
For more information about queries, see
Build queries in the Logs Explorer .
For sample queries, see Sample queries using the Logs Explorer .
Troubleshooting
Typographical errors and unknown field names result in the
gcloud CLI
commands completing with invalid argument messages.
For example, if you forget the period in resource.type , then it
results in the error:
ERROR : ( gcloud . logging . read ) INVALID_ARGUMENT : Field not found : ' resourcetype ' .
When Cloud Logging hasn't been granted the necessary access permissions,
the gcloud CLI commands complete with
permission denied messages.
For example, if a Compute Engine VM
instance is configured with the default API settings, then the list
command completes with a permission denied error:
ERROR: (gcloud.logging.read) PERMISSION_DENIED: Request had insufficient authentication scopes.
To fix this condition, modify your Compute Engine VM instance
permissions to grant Cloud Logging read permission by doing the
following:
Go to the VM instance details page for your VM instance.
Click Stop . This action might take a minute or two to complete.
To modify the configuration, click Edit .
Search for the header Cloud API access scopes , and click
Details to display the settings for each API. Change the entry
from Cloud Logging API to Full . Click Save .
To restart your VM instance, click Start . After a few moments,
your VM is ready to use.
When APIs Explorer can't complete your command, or requires additional
authorization, it displays a message or error code:
200 response code and no entries : If the message nextPageToken is
displayed, then it indicates that APIs Explorer didn't have time to
complete the search. Add a pageToken to your request, set the value to
be the same as that given with the key nextPageToken , and then retry
the command.
400 response code : The query value is invalid. For example, if you
misspell global as gloobal , then the message is
Unsupported resource type: gloobal .
404 response code : The project ID is invalid. Check the spelling
of your project identifier.
You might be asked to sign into your
Google Cloud project and permit APIs Explorer to access your account.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, delete the Google Cloud project with the
resources.
(Optional) To delete the log entries you created, run the following gcloud
command:
gcloud logging logs delete my-test-log
If you don't delete your log entries, then they expire and are removed.
For retention information, see Quotas & limits .
