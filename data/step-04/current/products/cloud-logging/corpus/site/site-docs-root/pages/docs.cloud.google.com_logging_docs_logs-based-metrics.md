Log-based metrics overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides a conceptual overview of log-based metrics. These metrics
can help you observe trends and patterns in a large volume of log entries.
About log-based metrics
Log-based metrics are Cloud Monitoring metrics
that are derived from the content of log entries. For example, you can use a
log-based metric to count the number of log entries that contain a particular
message or to extract latency information recorded in log entries.
You can display log-based metrics in Cloud Monitoring charts, and alerting
policies can monitor these metrics.
Log-based metrics can apply at the project level or log bucket level.
Bucket-scoped log-based metrics are useful when you use aggregated sinks
to route log entries to a log bucket, and when you route log entries from
one project to a log bucket in another project. For more information, see
the section of this page titled
Sources of log-based metrics .
How time-series values for log-based metrics are determined
This section briefly describes how the values in a time series for a
counter-type log-based metric are determined. It also describes why a
time series for a log-based metric might have gaps.
The process is similar for distribution-valued log-based metrics.
For counter-type log-based metrics,
Logging does the following:
It creates one or more data streams and for each stream, it manages a set of
in-memory counters.
There is one stream for each combination of
unique values for the set of metric and resource labels.
Each in-memory counter is for a different time interval,
but each counter records the number of log entries that match the filter and
that have a timestamp which corresponds to the interval.
Every minute, for each stream, the Logging backend uses the
values of the in-memory counters to determine how to update a time series
that is managed by Cloud Monitoring.
If there are five streams, then there are five time series managed by
Monitoring. You can chart these time series. You can also
create alerting policies to monitor these time series.
Note: A time series for a log-based metric can include values of zero and
can have data gaps. If you plan to create an alerting policy to monitor
a log-based metric, then we recommend that you configure
how the policy handles missing data .
Example: How zero values can cause data gaps
Consider the following time series:
Example time series: (T1, -), (T2, -), (T3, 0), (T4, 1), (T5, 0), (T6, -)
In the previous expression, (T1, -) means that no value was written
for time T1 . This corresponds to a gap in the values in the time series.
In contrast (T3, 0) means that the value of the time series
at time T3 is zero.
For each stream, the backend system for log-based metrics uses the following
rules to determine what value to write to the time series stored by
Monitoring:
When the aggregated count for an interval is non-zero, that value is
written to the time series.
In the example time series, only the interval T4 has a
non-zero value. The value of 1 indicates that one log entry with a
timestamp that corresponds to the T4 interval
matched the filter of the log-based metric.
When the aggregated count for an interval is zero, a value of zero is written
to the time series when an adjacent interval has a non-zero value.
In the example time series, at time T3 , the aggregated count is zero.
However, a value of zero is written because at time T4 the aggregated count
is non-zero. Similarly, at time T5 , the aggregated count is zero. A value
of zero is written to the time series because the value for the previous
interval was non-zero.
Otherwise, the time series isn't updated and there is a data gap for the
interval.
In the example time series, there is no value for intervals T1 , T2 , and
T6 . In these intervals, the aggregated counts were zero and the counts for
the adjacent intervals were also zero.
Handling of late-arriving and future log entries
When log entries arrive with a timestamp for an interval that
has been processed, the Logging backend
generates historical data. The historical data is used to update the
previously-written counts.
When log entries arrive with a timestamp that is in the future, the
Logging backend accumulates these counts. In the time series,
these log entries are counted when their timestamp corresponds to the
current interval.
Sources of log-based metrics
You can use the metrics defined by Cloud Logging to collect general usage
information, and you can define your own log-based metric to capture information
specific to your application or business.
Log-based metrics can apply within a single Google Cloud project or within a log
bucket. You can't create
log-based metrics for other Google Cloud resources such as
Cloud Billing accounts or organizations.
For information about the differences between project-based log-based metrics
and bucket-based log-based metrics, see
Bucket-scoped log-based metrics .
System-defined metrics
Logging provides a set of metrics for usage values such as the
number of log entries stored in log buckets in your project, or
the number of bytes you've exported.
For a complete list of system-defined metrics, see
Google Cloud metrics: logging .
System-defined log-based metrics apply at the project level.
The Log Router counts a log entry when all of the following are true:
The log entry passes through the log sinks of the project where the log-based metric
is defined.
The log entry is stored in a log bucket. The log bucket can be in any project.
For example, suppose project A has a log sink whose destination is
project B . Also assume that the log sinks in the project B route the
log entries to a log bucket. In this scenario, the log entries routed
from project A to project B contribute to project A 's
system-defined log-based metrics. These log entries also contribute to project B 's
system-defined log-based metrics.
User-defined metrics
You can create user-defined log-based metrics to
track other metrics that are important for your project. For
example, you might create a log-based metric to count the number of log
entries that match a given filter.
By default, user-defined log-based metrics are calculated from all logs
received by the Logging API for the Google Cloud project,
regardless of any inclusion filters or
exclusion filters that might apply to the
Google Cloud project.
You can also create user-defined log-based metrics
for a specific log bucket in a Google Cloud project. Bucket-scoped
log-based metrics are calculated from all logs destined for the bucket,
regardless of where they originated. For more information see
Log-based metrics on log buckets .
The Log Router counts a log entry when all of the following are true:
Billing is enabled on the project where the log-based metric is defined.
For bucket-scoped metrics, the log entry is stored in the log bucket where the
log-based metric is defined.
For project-scoped metrics, the log entry passes through the log sinks of the project where
the log-based metric is defined.
Data types for log-based metrics
Log-based metrics can extract data from logs to create metrics of the
following types:
Counter: these metrics count the number of log entries that match a
specified filter within a specific period. Use counters when you want to keep
track of the number of times a value or string appears in your logs.
Distribution: these metrics also count values, but they collect the
counts into ranges of values ( histogram buckets ). Use distributions when you
want to extract values like latencies.
Boolean: these metrics capture whether or not a log entry matches a specified
filter.
User-defined log-based metrics can be of the counter or distribution metric
types. Most system-defined log-based metrics are counters, but some are of
the boolean type. The characteristics of counters and distributions are
described in more detail in subsequent sections.
The data for a user-defined log-based metric comes only from log entries
received after the metric is created . A metric isn't retroactively
populated with data from log entries that are already in Logging.
System log-based metrics are calculated from included logs only. User-defined
log-based metrics are calculated from both included and excluded logs.
The following sections describe the characteristics of counter-type and
distribution-type metrics.
Counter metrics
Counter metrics count the number of log entries matching a given filter. For
example, you can do the following:
Count the log entries that contain a certain specific error message.
Count the number of times each user invokes an operation, by looking for log
messages that match this pattern:
... user USERNAME called OPERATION ...
By extracting USERNAME and OPERATION and using them as
values for two labels , you can later ask, "How many times did
sally call the update operation?", "How many people called the read
operation?", "How many times did george call an operation?", and so on.
For more information, see Configure counter metrics .
Distribution metrics
Distribution metrics accumulate numeric data from log entries matching a
filter. The metrics contain a time series of distribution objects, each of
which contains the following:
A count of the number of values in the distribution.
The mean of the values.
The sum of squared deviations: Sum i=1..n (x i –mean) 2
A set of histogram buckets with the count of values in each bucket. You can
use the default bucket layout or choose your own.
A common use for distribution metrics is to track latencies. As each log entry
is received, a latency value is extracted from somewhere in the log entry and is
added to the distribution. At regular intervals, the accumulated distribution is
written to Cloud Monitoring.
For information about distributions, including their format within a time series
and how they are visualized, see
Charting distribution metrics .
For information about creating distribution log-based metrics, see
Configure distribution metrics .
Resource types
We recommend that your log-based metrics specify a single resource type.
This specification ensures that the time series generated for your
log-based metric matches the data model expected by Cloud Monitoring.
It also simplifies the process of creating charts and alerting policies, as
there is no ambiguity as to which time-series data is charted or monitored.
Consider a log-based metric with the following filter:
severity > = "ERROR"
resource . type = "gce_instance"
Cloud Monitoring recognizes that this data is for a Compute Engine
VM instance. Therefore, when you create a chart for a VM instance, your
log-based metric is listed as an option in the menus. When you
create a chart for a different resource type, your
log-based metric isn't listed as an option.
If you create a log-based metric without specifying a resource type, then
Monitoring lists your log-based metric as an option for multiple
resource types, even though you don't count entries from those resources.
Labels
Log-based metrics can have labels, which allow multiple time series
to be collected for the metric. Values for the labels are extracted from fields
in the matching log entries. Logging records separate time series
for each combination of label values.
Most log-based metrics provide a default log label.
This label holds the value of the LOG_ID portion of the
logName field in the log entry , for example,
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity .
System log-based metrics have predefined
labels that can't be changed.
User-defined log-based metrics can include labels that you define. Typically,
these labels extract values from the log entries that contribute to the
log-based metric.
For example, you can use labels in the log-based metric to record the folder
or organization from which a log entry originated, even though bucket-scoped
log-based metrics can't be created for folders or organizations. For more
information, see Log-based metric labels .
Charts and alerting policies in Cloud Monitoring
You can use both system and user-defined log-based metrics in
Cloud Monitoring to create charts and alerting policies. For these charts
and alerting policies, you can use labels to filter or combine time series.
For example, you can set a filter to show only certain time series. For more
information, see List and chart log-based metrics and
Alert on log-based metrics .
In Cloud Monitoring, log-based metrics use the following naming patterns:
System: logging.googleapis.com/ SYSTEM_METRIC_NAME
User-defined: logging.googleapis.com/user/ USER_METRIC_NAME
Note that user-defined log-based metrics include the string user .
Visibility to Monitoring metrics scopes
Log-based metrics are ingested by Cloud Monitoring, and the visibility
of metric data to a Google Cloud project is determined by a metrics scope.
A metrics scope is a list of projects that are monitored by the project
that hosts the metrics scope; the hosting project is called a
scoping project .
By default, each project hosts a metrics scope that
includes only itself, so a project is a scoping project for itself.
Therefore, your metrics, including log-based metrics, are visible only to your
Google Cloud project.
You can also create a multi-project metrics scope for the
scoping project. With a multi-project metrics scope, the
scoping project can see the metrics from all the projects
in the metrics scope. What is visible to the individual projects in a
multi-project metrics scope is determined by the metrics scope
hosted by each of those projects. The fact that two projects are in a
multi-project metrics scope does not mean that each project has access to
the metric or configuration data in the other project.
A single project can also appear in multiple metrics scopes.
The metrics from such a project are visible to
the scoping projects of each of those metrics scopes.
Metrics, including log-based metrics, are defined within a specific project.
When that project appears in multiple metrics scopes,
the metrics are visible to projects other than the one in which they are
defined. For information about how metrics scopes and bucket-scoped log-based
metrics interact, see Projects and metrics scopes .
For more information about metrics scopes, including multi-project
metrics scopes, and about scoping projects, see the following:

Limitations
You can't create log-based metrics that count the number of log entries
that contain an error group. You also can't extract the ID of an
error group into a label attached to a log-based metric.
Quotas and limits
