Methods
Client
Client (
* ,
project = None ,
credentials = None ,
_http = None ,
_use_grpc = None ,
client_info = None ,
client_options = None
)
Parameters
Name
Description
project
Optional[str]
the project which the client acts on behalf of. If not passed, falls back to the default inferred from the environment.
credentials
Optional[google.auth.credentials.Credentials]
Thehe OAuth2 Credentials to use for this client. If not passed (and if no _http object is passed), falls back to the default inferred from the environment.
_http
Optional[requests.Session]
HTTP object to make requests. Can be any object that defines request() with the same interface as requests.Session.request . If not passed, an _http object is created that is bound to the credentials for the current object. This parameter should be considered private, and could change in the future.
_use_grpc
Optional[bool]
Explicitly specifies whether to use the gRPC transport or HTTP. If unset, falls back to the GOOGLE_CLOUD_DISABLE_GRPC environment variable This parameter should be considered private, and could change in the future.
client_info
Optional[Union[google.api_core.client_info.ClientInfo, google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo]]
The client info used to send a user-agent string along with API requests. If None , then default info will be used. Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing your own library or partner tool.
client_options
Optional[Union[dict, google.api_core.client_options.ClientOptions]]
Client options used to set user options on the client. API Endpoint should be set through client_options.
close
close ()
Closes the Client and all handlers associated with this Client.
flush_handlers
flush_handlers ()
Flushes all Python log handlers associated with this Client.
get_default_handler
get_default_handler ( ** kw )
Return the default logging handler based on the local environment.
Parameter
Name
Description
kw
dict
keyword args passed to handler constructor
Returns
Type
Description
logging.Handler
The default log handler based on the environment
list_entries
list_entries (
* ,
resource_names = None ,
filter_ = None ,
order_by = None ,
max_results = None ,
page_size = None ,
page_token = None
)
Return a generator of log entry resources.
Parameters
Name
Description
resource_names
Sequence[str]
Names of one or more parent resources from which to retrieve log entries: :: "projects/[PROJECT_ID]" "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]" "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]" "folders/[FOLDER_ID]" If not passed, defaults to the project bound to the API's client.
filter_
str
a filter expression. See https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters
order_by
str
or :data: logging_v2.DESCENDING .
max_results
Optional[int]
Optional. The maximum number of entries to return. Non-positive values are treated as 0. If None, uses API defaults.
page_size
int
number of entries to fetch in each API call. Although requests are paged internally, logs are returned by the generator one at a time. If not passed, defaults to a value set by the API.
page_token
str
opaque marker for the starting "page" of entries. If not passed, the API will return the first page of entries.
list_metrics
list_metrics ( * , max_results = None , page_size = None , page_token = None )
