Prepare Oracle databases for Backup and DR
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Before you begin, it's a good idea to review Backup and DR Service for Oracle .
Before you can back up Oracle databases, you must add the Oracle server as a
host to Backup and DR Service. For this to work, be sure to consult Prerequisites for backing up an Oracle database and then follow these preparation steps.
Preparation procedures for Oracle databases
Step
Preparation procedure
1
Prepare Oracle databases in a Linux environment
or
Prepare Oracle databases in a Windows environment
2
Prepare to back up an Oracle database with data files on an ASM disk group
3
Prepare Oracle database authentication
Enable database block change tracking (optional)
Protect from an Oracle Data Guard node
Configure RAC transparent failover of RMAN backup to other nodes
Oracle archive logs compression
Configure Oracle database services for load balancing across multiple nodes
Patch Oracle 12c
Prepare Oracle databases in a Linux environment
Before you protect an Oracle database, or if database
protection jobs fail, make sure that the following settings are correct
on the Oracle database server.
Each Oracle database to be protected must be up and running. For example:
database: actdb
ps -ef | grep pmon | grep -i actdb
oracle 27688 1 0 2015 ? 00:26:24 ora_pmon_actdb
The database must be running in archive log mode. To verify that the database
is running in archive log mode, sign in to the database server as Oracle OS
user and set the database environment variable:
export ORACLE_HOME = <oracle home path>
# Get this from /etc/oratab
export ORACLE_SID = <database instance name>
export PATH = $ORACLE_HOME /bin: $PATH
Login to sqlplus:
sqlplus / as sysdba
archive log list ;
Database log mode Archive Mode
Automatic archival Enabled
Archive destination + FRA
Oldest online log sequence 569
Next log sequence to archive 570
Current log sequence 570
Note: If archive log mode is not enabled then get archive mode enabled
before proceeding.
The database should be using spfile . Verify that the database is running
with spfile :
sqlplus / as sysdba
show parameter spfile
NAME TYPE VALUE
------------------ ----------- ------------
spfile string + DATA / ctdb / spfilectdb . ora
Note : If the value is `null_` then
get the spfile set . Backup and DR supports backing up using pfile as well .
pfile should be available in default location . For example , a
Linux `pfile` should be located under `$ORACLE_HOME/dbs` .
For Oracle RAC database, the snapshot control file must be located under
shared disks. For an Oracle RAC database under ASM, the snapshot control file
must be located under shared disks.
To check this, connect to RMAN and run the show all command. Configure it
if necessary:
rman target /
Then in RMAN:
show all
RMAN configuration parameters for database with db_unique_name CTDB are:
CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO REDUNDANCY 1 ; # default
CONFIGURE BACKUP OPTIMIZATION OFF ; # default
CONFIGURE DEFAULT DEVICE TYPE TO DISK ; # default
CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP OFF ; # default
CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK TO '%F' ; # default
CONFIGURE DEVICE TYPE DISK PARALLELISM 1 BACKUP TYPE TO BACKUPSET ; # default
CONFIGURE SNAPSHOT CONTROLFILE NAME TO '/mnt/ctdb/snapcf_ctdb.f' ;
This example shows the configuration set to the local file system .
In a RAC environment , this must be set to shared ASM Disk Group . To put it
on the ASM Disk Group , use :
``` bash
CONFIGURE SNAPSHOT CONTROLFILE NAME TO '+(disk group name)/snap_(database name).f' ;
```
Prepare to back up an Oracle database with data files on an ASM disk group
Backup and DR staging disk on an ASM disk group
The ASM diskstring parameter must be set and is not null. Sign in to the
database server as ASM OS user and set the ASM environment variable:
export ORACLE_HOME =( oracle ASM home path )
# Get this from /etc/oratab
export ORACLE_SID =( ASM instance name )
export PATH = $ORACLE_HOME /bin: $PATH
Connect to sqlplus :
sqlplus / as sysasm
show parameter asm_diskstring
NAME TYPE VALUE
------------------- ----------- ------------------------------
asm_diskstring string ORCL : * , / dev / sdt1 , / dev / sdu1
If the result of value is null, then get the correct ASM disk string value
for existing ASM disks before proceeding with Backup and DR
protection. The Backup and DR backup adds its disk string path
( /dev/Backup and DR/asm/* ) for its backup staging disk to
map to ASM.
Backup and DR staging disk on the file system
If you are protecting an Oracle ASM database to a file system, then
Convert ASM to file system must be set to Yes under
Application Details & Settings .
See Application details & settings for Oracle Databases .
Prepare Oracle database authentication
The following additional preparation steps are required only if you plan to
use database authentication. Oracle database authentication is described in
Backup and DR using database authentication .
Note: Backup and DR Service does not support database authentication to Oracle in
Windows environments.
Follow the steps in Prepare Oracle databases in a Linux environment .
Create a database user account for Backup and DR backup, if not provided:
create user act_rman_user identified by < password > ;
Grant sysdba access to all RAC nodes by logging into sqlplus to all nodes and running:
grant create session , resource , sysdba to act_rman_user ;
For Oracle 12c this role can be sysbackup instead of sysdba , and the
database username starts with #.
Verify that the sysdba role has been granted on all nodes in
the RAC environment:
sqlplus / as sysasm
select * from gv$pwfile_users ;
INST_ID USERNAME SYSDB SYSOP SYSAS
---------- -------------- ----- ----- -----
1 SYS TRUE TRUE FALSE
2 SYS TRUE TRUE FALSE
1 ACT_RMAN_USER TRUE TRUE FALSE
2 ACT_RMAN_USER TRUE TRUE FALSE
Test the service name based on your environment type using the following
instructions:
Create and verify the Oracle servicename in a non-RAC environment
Create and verify the Oracle servicename in a RAC environment
Create and verify the Oracle servicename in a non-RAC environment
The Oracle servicename is used for database authentication only.
It is not needed for OS authentication.
Example:
Database name: dbstd ,
Instance Name: dbstd
If the Oracle servicename is not listed, then
create the service name entry in the tnsnames.ora file
at $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin or at $GRID_HOME/network/admin
by adding the entry:
act_svc_dbstd =
(DESCRIPTION =
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = (IP of the database server))(PORT = 1521))
(CONNECT_DATA =
(SERVER = DEDICATED)
(SERVICE_NAME = dbstd)
) )
If the tnsnames.ora file is in a non-standard location, then
provide the absolute path to it under Application Details & Settings
as described in Application details & settings for Oracle databases
Test the service name entry for the database to make sure it is configured:
Login as Oracle OS user and set the Oracle environment:
TNS_ADMIN =( tnsnames.ora file location )
tnsping act_svc_dbstd
Check the database user account to be sure the Backup and DR backup can
connect:
sqlplus act_rman_user/act_rman_user@act_svc_dbstd as sysdba
Provide the servicename created (act_svc_dbstd) under the
Oracle Service Name setting under Application Details & Settings as
described in Application details & settings for Oracle Databases
Create and verify the Oracle servicename in a RAC environment
The Oracle servicename is used for database authentication
only. It is not needed for OS authentication.
Example three-node RAC:
Database name: dbrac
Instance1 name: dbrac1
Instance2 name: dbrac2
Instance3 name: dbrac3 with database protection being set from
Node3 (Instance name dbrac3 ):
Create a servicename entry in tnsnames.ora file
at $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin or at $GRID_HOME/network/admin by adding
the following entry:
act_svc_dbrac3 =
(DESCRIPTION =
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = (IP of the database server)(PORT = 1521))
(CONNECT_DATA =
(SERVER = DEDICATED)
(INSTANCE_NAME = dbrac3)
(SERVICE_NAME = dbrac)
) ) )
Where:
HOST = This can be SCAN IP in a RAC environment or VIP or IP of the node 3 database server.
SERVICE_NAME = database name
INSTANCE_NAME = database instance name on node3
Test the servicename:
Login as Oracle OS user and set the Oracle environment:
TNS_ADMIN =( tnsnames.ora file location )
tnsping act_svc_dbrac3
Check the database user account to be sure the Backup and DR backup can connect:
sqlplus act_rman_user/act_rman_user@act_svc_dbrac3 as sysdba
Provide the service name created (act_svc_dbrac3)
under the Oracle Service name setting under Application Details & Settings
described in Application details & settings for Oracle Databases .
If the tnsnames.ora file is in a non-standard location, then provide
the absolute path to the tnsnames.ora file under the Oracle TNS_Admin
Path setting udner Application Details & Settings described in
Application details & settings for Oracle databases
Enable database block change tracking (optional)
Database change block tracking is described in
Oracle database block change tracking (BCT)
To check if database block change tracking is enabled:
sqlplus / as sysdba
On the sql prompt:
select * from v$block_change_tracking ;
Note: Tracking is optional. Oracle standard edition and Oracle
express edition do not support tracking. Tracking is described
in Oracle Database Block Change Tracking (BCT) .
If database block change tracking is not enabled, then enable database block
change tracking from sqlplus:
Using ASM Disk Group
sqlplus / as sysdba
On the sql prompt:
alter database enable block change tracking using file '+<ASM Disk Group Name>/<database name>/<dbname>.bct' ;
Using file system
sqlplus / as sysdba
On the sql prompt:
alter database enable block change tracking using file '$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/<dbname>.bct' ;
Protect from an Oracle Data Guard node
You can protect an Oracle database from primary database
nodes or from Oracle Data Guard standby nodes. If protection is set from
an Oracle Data Guard node, then make sure to set the primary node credentials
under Application Details & Settings in the appliance management console.
For database authentication (Linux only)
Username/Password : The database user account credentials.
In order for this user account to be available on the Data Guard node
with sysdba access, this user must be created with sysdba privilege at
the Primary node (see creating backup user account with sysdba access).
Then the password file (under $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/ ) from the primary node
must be copied over to the Data Guard node.
Note: Backup and DR Service does not support database authentication to Oracle
in Windows environments.
For OS authentication
Username/Password : Under OS Authentication, sysdba privilege
is not required. This database user account needs the privilege connect, alter system .
In order for this user account to be available on the Data Guard node,
this user must be created at the primary node.
If the user does not have the sysdba role, then the user needs grant connect, alter system, select on dba_tablespaces .
To grant these privileges, on the sql prompt:
grant connect , alter system , select on dba_tablespaces to act_rman_user ;
Oracle Data Guard Primary Node Servicename : This is the servicename
in the tnsnames.ora file configured on the Data Guard node to
connect to the primary node from the standby node. Oracle Data Guard
Primary Node Servicename is required for both OS and DB authentication
if the backup is configured from the Data Guard standby node.
For full details on all details & settings, see
Application details & settings for Oracle Databases
Database Node
OS Authentication
Database Authentication
Primary
No database credentials
are needed.
Database credentials are needed. If no role is selected, then sysdba is used.
Standby
Database credentials are needed even for OS Auth (to connect to primary to
switch log).
The database credentials don't need to have a sysdba/sysbackup role.
If a sysdba/sysbackup account is used, then set
the user role in User Role in the Database
in the Application Details & Settings.
Database credentials are needed.
The database credentials must be for either the sysdba or sysbackup role,
and User Role in the Database must be set to sysdba or
sysbackup in the Application Details & Settings .
To set up database authentication, see Enabling Database Authentication for an Oracle Server .
Configure RAC transparent failover of RMAN backup to other nodes
The Backup and DR agent must be installed and running
on all nodes that you plan to be part of the backup failover configuration.
The protection is set up from one node only.
Note: In an Oracle One Node environment, both nodes must be
discovered and protected with the same template and profile.
In Details & Settings, Cluster Nodes, specify the failover node
choice in a Oracle RAC environment:
<Failover choice>:<Node IP>:<Servicename>:<Role>
Where:
Failover Choice: the order of node in which to fail over.
Node IP: the IP address of the node where you want the backup to run
Servicename: the name of the service created and specified in the
tnsnames.ora for Backup and DR RMAN backup. This can be a new
dedicated service created for Backup and DR backup or the SID
name (instance name) of the database on that node.
Role: F, indicating it is a failover node
To create a new servicename on failover node under
tnsnames.ora file ($ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora or at $GRID_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora)
Example in an Oracle One Node environment
RAC One Node consists of two nodes:
172.15.157.200
172.15.157.201
It has one database OneN running only at one of the
nodes at any given time. OneN is protected from 172.15.157.200, with
Cluster Node settings specified as 1:172.15.157.201:OneN:F
If OneN fails over to 172.15.157.201, Backup and DR backup
follows it and starts the next backup job from 172.15.157.201 instead
of 200. If failover occurs in the middle of a backup job, then the job
fails and the next job uses the failover node to start new backup.
Example in an Oracle Environment, not One Node:
2 node RAC ( dbrac1 , dbrac2 )
Protection is set using database name "dbrac" from dbrac1
and failover is to be set to dbrac2
Service name on node2: act_svc_dbrac2
Node2 IP or scan IP: 172.1.1.0
act_svc_node2 =
(DESCRIPTION =
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 172.1.1.0)(PORT = 1521))
(CONNECT_DATA =
(SERVER = DEDICATED)
(INSTANCE_NAME = dbrac2)
(SERVICE_NAME = dbrac)
) )
Under Application Details & Settings , the cluster nodes entries are the
following:
1:172.1.1.1:act_svc_node2:F
The behavior of cluster node entries F and M
F : Failover node, only participates when protecting node is not
to perform the backup.
M : Maintenance node, replaces protecting node if validated
to be able to perform the backup.
Oracle archive logs compression
Backup and DR archive log backup supports Oracle log backup set
compression. The type of compression you select depends on these RMAN
configuration settings. Select an option based on your use case.
Lower compression ratios create the least impact on backup throughput.
These are best suited for environments where CPU resources are the limiting
factor.
Medium compression is recommended for most environments. These provide
a good combination of compression ratios and speed.
High compression ratios are resource intensive and are best suited
for backups over slower networks where the limiting factor is network speed.
The default setting is Basic. Basic does not require Oracle Advanced
Compression.
To check the type of compression set in the environment, run the show all
command from the RMAN prompt:
rman target /
show all
Configure Oracle database services for load balancing across multiple nodes
This procedure applies only to Oracle ASM databases. In this example, assume a
four-node RAC environment; nodes 3 and 4 are to be load-balanced for backup use.
See:
Configure parallel RMAN image copy from multiple nodes
Configure Oracle database services for load balancing across multiple nodes
Load balancing between Oracle RAC nodes requires Oracle database authentication.
Configure parallel RMAN image copy from multiple nodes
In a RAC environment, you can configure backup to run in parallel
from multiple nodes.
Install the Backup and DR agent on all nodes.
Setup the ASM disk group mapping to node 3 and
node 4 using Application details & settings.
Create a database service using srvctl to run
from node 3 and node 4.
Use this service to specify under Application Details & Settings .
Choose Number of channels under Advanced Settings
(# of channels). RMAN distributes the channels between node 3 and
node 4.
Set Oracle servicename and RAC Member Nodes.
Configure Oracle Database Services for load balancing across multiple nodes
Configure in Application Details & Settings ,
RAC Member Nodes: IP of node3 and IP of node 4.
Create a database service for the maintenance
node to be used by Backup and DR for backup:
srvctl add service -d <dbname> -s act_service_<dbname> -r <dbinstance3>,<dbinstance4>
srvctl start service -d <dbname> -s act_service_<dbname>
Add the tns entry for the Oracle service name
created on backup nodes ( dbinstance3 and dbinstance4 node in this example)
under tnsnames.ora
file ($ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora or at $GRID_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora)
act_service_<dbname> =
(DESCRIPTION =
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = <SCAN IP>)(PORT = 1521))
(CONNECT_DATA =
(SERVER = DEDICATED)
(SERVICE_NAME = <DATABASE NAME>)
) )
Test the created servicename created:
tnsping act_service_<dbname>
Test the servicename and user credentials:
sqlplus act_rman_user/act_rman_user@act_service_<dbname> as sysdba
Specify this service name under Application Details & Settings Oracle
service name.
Create a dedicated archive log backup service on a protected node
(e.g. node 3) to be used for backup:
srvctl add service -d <dbname> -s act_arc_service_<dbname> -r <dbinstance3>
srvctl start service -d <dbname> -s act_arc_service_<dbname>
Add the tns entry for the archive log backup service name created
under tnsnames.ora file ( $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora or at
$GRID_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora )
act_arc_service_<dbname> =
(DESCRIPTION =
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = <SCAN IP>)(PORT = 1521))
(CONNECT_DATA =
(SERVER = DEDICATED)
(INSTANCE_NAME = <node 3 instance>)
(SERVICE_NAME = act_arc_service_<dbname>)
) )
Test the service name:
tnsping act_arch_service_<dbname>
Specify this servicename under Application Details & Settings archive log
backup servicename.
Note: Load balancing between Oracle RAC nodes requires Oracle database
authentication.
