Migrate containers that were deployed on VMs during VM creation
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The container startup agent in Compute Engine is deprecated. This agent lets you
deploy containers on Compute Engine instances when you create VMs.
This document describes how to migrate existing containers that the startup
agent created on your VMs or managed instance groups (MIGs) to other
Google Cloud services.
Based on your requirements, choose one of the following options to
migrate the containers that were deployed on VMs using the deprecated method:
If you want to continue running containers on individual VMs and MIGs, use
startup scripts or cloud-init .
If you have stateless container applications and small to medium jobs,
use Cloud Run .
If your container is a batch job that has a definite end state and requires
additional computing resources, use Batch .
If you need advanced control and scalability or if you can't meet your
requirements with the other options, use GKE on Google Cloud .
For more use cases and alternative solutions, see Compare the container deployment options .
Prevent the creation of new VMs that use the container startup agent
To prevent the creation of new VMs that use the deprecated container startup
agent, organization administrators can enforce an organization policy. For more
information, see Prevent the creation of VMs that use the deprecated container
metadata .
Deprecated options for configuring containers on VMs
When you configure a container during VM creation,
Compute Engine uses the container startup agent to read the
gce-container-declaration metadata that stores the
container information, and to deploy the container on the VM.
The following options for deploying containers directly on a VM or MIG
that use the container startup agent and the gce-container-metadata are deprecated.
Console
The Deploy container option on the Create an instance page is deprecated:
gcloud
The following gcloud commands that configure a container on a VM or an instance template are deprecated:
gcloud compute instances create-with-container
gcloud compute instances update-container
gcloud compute instance-templates create-with-container
gcloud compute instances create command that uses the --metadata flag to set the gce-container-declaration metadata key
gcloud compute instance-templates create command that uses the --metadata flag to set the gce-container-declaration metadata key
Terraform
The Terraform module gce-container
and the gce-container-declaration metadata key to configure containers are deprecated.
Prevent the creation of VMs that use the container startup agent
To prevent the creation of new VMs that use the deprecated container startup agent by using an organization policy,
see Prevent the creation of VMs that use the deprecated container metadata .
Identify instances that use the deprecated container metadata
To identify instances in your project that use the deprecated container
metadata, follow these steps to check for the gce-container-declaration
metadata key:
Run one of the following commands:
To list all instances in your project that use the
gce-container-declaration metadata key and value, run the following
gcloud CLI command:
gcloud compute instances list --filter = "metadata.items.key:gce-container-declaration"
This command provides a list of all VM instances in your configured
project that contain the gce-container-declaration metadata key.
The metadata key uniquely identifies VMs that are in scope of the
deprecation. If you are using multiple projects, run this command
across all of the active projects.
To validate a specific instance, run the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud compute instances describe VM_NAME --format = "(metadata.items)"
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM
instance that you want to validate.
If the output of the command from the preceding step lists
instances that use the gce-container-declaration metadata key, run
the following command to get more details about the container
declaration on your VMs:
gcloud compute instances list \
--filter = 'metadata.items.key:gce-container-declaration AND (metadata.items.value~"image:")' \
--format = "table(name, zone, metadata.items.filter(key='gce-container-declaration').extract(value).slice(0):label=CONTAINER_DECLARATION)"
Based on the output of the command, consider the following:
If the metadata contains the definition for the deprecated container startup agent, then
you must migrate the container deployment to an alternative solution as described in
this document.
If the gce-container-declaration metadata key is present, but you are
not using it for the container startup agent, take the following actions:
Check if you are reusing this metadata key for other configurations.
If you are reusing the key, use a different metadata key for other configurations.
For more information about viewing metadata, see View and query metadata .
Compare the container deployment options
The following table summarizes the use cases for running containers on VMs and
recommends alternative container solutions for migrating your workloads:
Use cases
Replacement type
Cost
Recommended solution
Continue running container on a VM or a MIG.
Less familiar with serverless or managed solutions.
Run container for testing and development.
Your workload consists of a single VM.
Run container in the privileged mode.
Direct replacement
No additional cost
Use startup scripts to deploy containers on VMs .
Continue running container on a VM or a MIG.
Run multiple containers on a single VM.
Configure advanced scenarios on containers or VMs.
For example, create users,
import files, mount disks, or use privileged mode.
Your workload consists of multiple VMs or MIGs.
Direct replacement
No additional cost
Use cloud-init to run tasks during the VM lifecycle .
Run a batch job that has a definite end state and
requires additional computing resources.
Managed service
Depends on your workload characteristics and complexity of the container
configuration.
Batch
Run stateless applications.
Run small to medium size jobs.
Managed service
No to low cost solution for smaller workloads.
Cloud Run
You already have an existing GKE cluster.
You need advanced control and scalability.
Managed service
Depends on workload characteristics and complexity of the container configuration.
Google Kubernetes Engine
When you transition from the Compute Engine container startup agent to an
alternative solution, consider the following required changes and the potential
effort of implementing them:
VMs running Container-Optimized OS : Take full ownership of VM and container
runtime setup, configuration, security, and maintenance, which often
involves scripting with startup scripts or cloud-init .
Cloud Run or Batch : Ensure that your applications are
stateless and fit the request-driven or job-based execution model. This
approach might involve adapting
applications to work with external state management services.
GKE : Adopt Kubernetes principles, define workloads by using
Kubernetes manifest files, and manage cluster resources.
Use startup scripts to deploy containers on VMs
You can run a basic container on a VM using a startup script.
Consider the following points when you use a startup script to configure containers:
You can use a startup script for basic scenarios. For advanced configuration,
consider using cloud-init .
Because you are creating a new VM with a container configured using the startup script, you must plan
for the transition of any workloads deployed on the existing VMs.
Test and ensure that everything works as expected before you route traffic
to your newly created VM with a container.
To create a VM and to deploy a container on a VM or a MIG, do the following:
Map current container on VM metadata to startup script command
Create a startup script based on the existing metadata configuration
Create a VM by using the startup script or Create a MIG by using the startup script .
Map your container metadata to docker run command
You can map the VM metadata or gcloud flags
to docker run arguments and include this in your startup script for creating VMs.
Some gcloud flags translate directly to VM metadata. These flags also
translate directly to docker run flags.
If you have an existing container on a VM, you can read the VM metadata
configuration and build a startup script using the equivalent docker run commands.
# Get your existing VM instance configuration in yaml format
gcloud compute instances describe VM_NAME --format = "(metadata.items)"
The output is similar to the following:
metadata:
items:
- key: gce-container-declaration
value: |
spec:
containers:
- args:
- '"hello world!"'
command:
- echo
env:
- name: ONE
value: '1'
image: docker.io/library/busybox
name: my-instance
securityContext:
privileged: true
stdin: true
tty: true
restartPolicy: Always
- key: google-logging-enabled
value: 'true'
Use the following table to map existing specification to docker run commands:
gcloud CLI flag
VM metadata key
Docker run command
--container-image
containers.image
Specify as an argument without any flag.
For example:
docker run gcr.io/google-containers/busybox
--container-command
command
Specify as an argument without any flag, after the container
image name.
For example:
docker run gcr.io/google-containers/busybox echo "hello world"
--container-arg
args
Specify as an argument without any flag, after the command.
For example:
docker run gcr.io/google-containers/busybox echo "hello world"
--container-env
containers.env array
--env KEY=VALUE [--env KEY=VALUE ...]
--container-restart-policy
restartPolicy
--restart
Possible values are no , on-failure , and always . Default is no .
--container-stdin
containers.stdin
-i
Boolean flag, true if present, false by default.
--container-tty
containers.tty
-t
Boolean flag, true if present, false by default.
--container-privileged
containers.securityContext.privileged
--privileged
Boolean flag, true if present, false by default.
--container-mount-disk
-
No equivalent docker run command.
You can mount the disk separately.
Example startup scripts
The following examples show how to include the docker commands in your startup
script:
Example 1: runs a standalone container in a VM based on
Container-Optimized OS.
Example 2: runs a web server container in a VM based on
Container-Optimized OS.
Example 1
Run a standalone container in a VM based on Container-Optimized OS:
#!/bin/bash
# A name for the container
CONTAINER_NAME = "my-app-container"
# Stop and remove the container if it exists
docker stop $CONTAINER_NAME || true
docker rm $CONTAINER_NAME || true
# Pull the latest version of the container image from Docker Hub
docker pull busybox:latest
# Run docker container from image in docker hub
docker run busybox:latest \
echo "hello world!"
Example 2
Run a web server container in a VM based on Container-Optimized OS:
#!/bin/bash
# Enable incoming traffic
iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT
# A name for the container
CONTAINER_NAME = "my-app-container"
# Stop and remove the container if it exists
docker stop $CONTAINER_NAME || true
docker rm $CONTAINER_NAME || true
# Pull the latest version of the container image from Docker Hub
docker pull nginx:latest
# Run docker container from image in docker hub
docker run \
--name = $CONTAINER_NAME \
--privileged \
--restart = always \
--tty \
--detach \
--network = "host" \
nginx:latest
Additional configuration options for container deployment
This section describes the additional configuration parameters
for deploying containers on your VMs.
For more information about these options, see Configure options to run a container .
Access to Artifact Registry images
If you need access to container images from gcr.io or pkg.dev,
use the docker-credential-gcr tool, which is preinstalled in Container-Optimized OS,
and configure authentication to Artifact Registry for Docker.
Run the following command before you run the container:
# Set home directory to save docker credentials
export HOME = /home/appuser
# Configure docker with credentials for gcr.io and pkg.dev
docker-credential-gcr configure-docker --registries LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev
Replace LOCATION with the location
of your repository.
For more information, see Configure authentication to Artifact Registry for Docker .
Configure logging
We recommend using Cloud Logging by enabling a logging agent on a VM.
Alternatively, if you want to change the logging driver, you can include
the --log-driver parameter with your docker run command:
# Use Cloud Logging logging driver
docker run --log-driver = gcplogs nginx:latest
For more information, see Using Cloud Logging with Container-Optimized OS
Configure internal firewall
Container-Optimized OS denies incoming traffic by default, so you must add
iptables rules to allow that traffic. Note that these commands configure the
host operating system's internal firewall. Additionally, you must configure your
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) firewall to allow that traffic to the new VM
For more information, see Use VPC firewall rules .
# Enable all incoming and routed traffic
iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT
For more information, see Configuring the host firewall .
Attach volumes to the container
If volumes are attached to the container, the container metadata includes the
volumes entry and a volumeMounts array. The name of an entry in volumes
corresponds to the name of an entry in volumeMounts , and the other way around.
For each volume that you collect, gather the required information either from
the volumes or from the volumeMounts entry.
If no volumes are attached to the container, you can skip this section and
directly create a VM by using the startup script .
For more information about disks and file system on Container-Optimized OS,
see Disks and file system overview .
Mount tmpfs file system
To mount an empty tmpfs file system to a container, specify the --tmpfs
argument with your docker run command. For example, to mount a cache file system
to your nginx container, run the following command:
# mount a cache file system to the nginx container
docker run -d --name = $CONTAINER_NAME --tmpfs /var/cache/nginx:rw,size = 512m,noexec,nosuid,nodev --network = "host" nginx:latest
For more information about mounting tmpfs file systems, see tmpfs mounts .
Mount a host directory
To mount a directory from a host VM to a container, specify the --mount argument
with the docker run command:
# mount a read-only directory to the nginx container
docker run -d --name = $CONTAINER_NAME --mount type = bind,source = /var/www/html,target = /usr/share/nginx/html,ro nginx:latest
For more information, see Bind mounts .
Mount a persistent disk to the container
Mounting a disk to the container requires additional steps. To mount a disk,
first mount it on the VM, and then mount that disk to the container:
To mount the disk to the VM, run the following command:
#!/bin/bash
DISK_DEVICE_NAME = "my-persistent-disk" # This name MUST match the 'device-name' in the gcloud --disk flag
DISK_BY_ID_PATH = "/dev/disk/by-id/google- ${ DISK_DEVICE_NAME } "
HOST_MOUNT_POINT = "/mnt/disks/my-persistent-disk" # This is the path where the disk will be mounted on the VM
CONTAINER_MOUNT_PATH = "/usr/share/my-persistent-disk" # This is the path where the disk will be mounted in the container
# format a disk as an ext4 filesystem, if it doesn't already contain one
file -sL $DISK_BY_ID_PATH | grep -q filesystem || \
mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -E lazy_itable_init = 0 ,lazy_journal_init = 0 ,discard $DISK_BY_ID_PATH
# create a directory for mounting point
sudo mkdir -p " ${ HOST_MOUNT_POINT } "
# mount a disk to the VM
sudo mount -o defaults,discard " ${ DISK_BY_ID_PATH } " " ${ HOST_MOUNT_POINT } "
After you mount the disk to the VM, add the --mount flag with the
docker run command to mount the disk to the container:
docker run -d --name = $CONTAINER_NAME --mount type = bind,source = " ${ HOST_MOUNT_POINT } " ,target = " ${ CONTAINER_MOUNT_PATH } " ,readonly nginx:latest
Create a VM by using the startup script
After creating a startup script with your container configuration, use this
startup script to create a VM based on Container-Optimized OS. For more
information about creating a VM based on Container-Optimized OS, see Create an instance from a public image .
For more information about using startup scripts, see Using startup scripts on Linux VMs .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create an instance page.
Go to Create an instance
If prompted, select your project and click Continue . The
Create an instance page appears and displays the
Machine configuration pane.
In the Machine configuration pane, select the machine family
and machine type for your VM.
In the navigation menu, click OS and storage . In the
Operating system and storage pane that appears, configure your boot
disk by doing the following:
Click Change . The Boot disk pane appears and displays the
Public images tab.

Click Select .
In the navigation menu, click Advanced .
In the Automation section, paste the startup script that you created
for your container deployment.
To create and start the VM, click Create .
gcloud
When using gcloud CLI, store a startup script in a separate file.
To create a VM by using a startup script, run the following
command:
gcloud compute instances create VM_NAME \
--zone= ZONE \
--image-family= IMAGE_FAMILY \
--image-project= IMAGE_PROJECT \
--machine-type= MACHINE_TYPE \
--metadata-from-file=startup-script= STARTUP_SCRIPT_FILE
Replace the following:
VM_NAME :
name of the
new VM.
ZONE : zone to create the instance in.
IMAGE_PROJECT : the Container-Optimized OS
image project that contains
the image, for example, cos-cloud .
IMAGE_FAMILY : the Container-Optimized OS
image family, for example, cos-stable .
MACHINE_TYPE : machine type for the new VM, which
can be a predefined machine type
or a custom
machine type.
STARTUP_SCRIPT_FILE : the relative path on your machine
to the startup script file, for example, ./startup_script.sh .
Example:
# Create COS-based VM by using a startup script
gcloud compute instances create "cos-instance-with-startup-script" \
--zone="us-central1-c" \
--machine-type="e2-medium" \
--image-family="cos-stable" \
--image-project="cos-cloud" \
--metadata-from-file=startup-script="./startup_script.sh"
Verify that Compute Engine created the VM by running the following command:
gcloud compute instances describe VM_NAME
Replace VM_NAME with the name of the VM you created.
Terraform
To create a VM, you can use the google_compute_instance
resource .
provider "google" {
project = " PROJECT_ID "
}
resource "google_compute_instance" "cos_vm_instance" {
name = " VM_NAME "
machine_type = " MACHINE_TYPE "
zone = " ZONE "
# Use a Container-Optimized OS image for the boot disk
boot_disk {
initialize_params {
image = " IMAGE_PROJECT / IMAGE_FAMILY "
}
}
# Attaches the instance to the default network
network_interface {
network = "default"
}
# Specify the relative path to the startup script on your local machine
metadata = {
startup-script = file(" STARTUP_SCRIPT_FILE ")
}
}
Replace the following:
VM_NAME :
name of the
new VM
ZONE : zone to create the instance in.
IMAGE_PROJECT : the Container-Optimized OS
image project that contains
the image, for example, cos-cloud .
IMAGE_FAMILY : the Container-Optimized OS image family,
for example, cos-stable .
MACHINE_TYPE : machine type for the new VM, which
can be a predefined machine type
or a custom
machine type.
STARTUP_SCRIPT_FILE : the relative path on your machine
to the startup script file, for example, ./startup_script.sh .
Example:
provider "google" {
project = "my-project"
}
resource "google_compute_instance" "my_container_vm" {
name = "my-container-vm-startup"
machine_type = "e2-medium"
zone = "us-central1-a"
boot_disk {
initialize_params {
image = "cos-cloud/cos-stable"
}
}
network_interface {
network = "default"
}
metadata = {
startup-script = file("./startup_script.sh")
}
}
Create a MIG by using the startup script
After creating an instance template using the startup script, use one of the
following methods to create a MIG.
For more information about creating MIGs, see Create a managed instance group .
Console
Create an instance template that is
based on the startup script you created in the previous section.
In the Operating system section, select a Container Optimized OS
and version.
In the Automation section, paste the startup script that you created
for the container deployment.
Create a MIG
by using the instance template created in the previous step.
gcloud
Create an instance template
by using the instance-templates create command .
You must use a Container-Optimized OS image for the VM.
You can specify the relative path to the startup script file in the --metadata-from-file flag.
Create a MIG
by using the instance template created in the previous step.
Example:
# Create the instance template that uses a startup script
gcloud compute instance-templates create startup-template \
--machine-type=e2-medium \
--image-family=cos-stable \
--image-project=cos-cloud \
--metadata-from-file=startup-script=./startup_script.sh
# Create the managed instance group
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create startup-mig \
--template=startup-template \
--size=2 \
--zone=us-central1-a
Terraform
Use the google_compute_instance_template and google_compute_instance_group_manager resources to
create an instance template and a MIG, as shown in the following example:
Example :
resource "google_compute_instance_template" "startup_template" {
name_prefix = "startup-template-"
machine_type = "e2-medium"
disk {
source_image = "cos-cloud/cos-stable"
auto_delete = true
boot = true
}
network_interface {
network = "default"
}
metadata = {
startup-script = file("./startup_script.sh")
}
}
resource "google_compute_instance_group_manager" "startup_mig" {
name = "startup-mig"
base_instance_name = "startup-vm"
zone = "us-central1-a"
version {
instance_template = google_compute_instance_template.startup_template.id
}
target_size = 2
}
Test and clean up
After successful creation of a VM or a MIG, validate that your application
is running on the container and working as expected. To fix any issues, see Troubleshooting .
If the application is running successfully on your new VMs created using the
startup script, you can delete the VMs
and MIGs that use the deprecated method of deploying containers.
Troubleshooting startup script issues
This section provides troubleshooting information for issues that you might
encounter when using startup scripts.
Unable to save docker configuration
When you run the docker-credential-gcr configure-docker command in a startup script,
you might get the following error message:
ERROR: Unable to save docker config: mkdir /root/.docker: read-only file system
This error occurs because docker-credential-gcr attempts to write credentials
to the /root/.docker/config.json file. The root file system on
Container-Optimized OS is read-only, so you can't write to it.
To resolve this issue, set the environment variable $HOME to
point to a custom home directory before you run the docker commands.
Example:
export HOME=/home/appuser
docker-credential-gcr configure-docker
View logs to debug issues
To troubleshoot issues that might occur when you configure containers on VMs using
a startup script, view the startup script logs and the container logs.
To view startup script logs on the VM instance, run the following command:
sudo journalctl | grep "startup-script"
To view logs from the Docker container, run the docker logs command:
docker logs CONTAINER_NAME
Replace CONTAINER_NAME with the name of your container.
For troubleshooting other issues, see the following documents:

Use cloud-init with Container-Optimized OS
You can use cloud-init ,
an industry-standard and cross-platform solution, to deploy containers on VMs
running Container-Optimized OS.
This tool lets you run custom configuration during the VM creation or startup.
For more information, see
Using cloud-init with the Cloud config format .
Use managed services for container deployment
This section describes the managed services provided by Google Cloud that you can
use to deploy containers.
Cloud Run
Cloud Run is a good option for stateless container applications and small to medium jobs.
Key features of Cloud Run include the following:
You can choose to only allocate CPUs during request processing, or always allocate CPUs.
You can run a stateless container application or execute a job as one-off, on a schedule, or as part of a workflow.
You can configure timeouts for each request or task.
It's highly scalable and secure.
It has integrated load balancing and autoscaling.
For more information about deploying containers on Cloud Run, see
Deploying container images to Cloud Run
Batch
Batch is a fully managed service that lets you schedule, queue,
and execute batch processing workloads on Google Cloud resources. It's designed
for running batch-style, parallelizable workloads, including those packaged in containers.
For more information about deploying containers on Batch, see the following documents:
Get started
Create and run a basic job
GKE
If you are running complex applications, microservices, continuous operation
and need fine-grained control and scalability, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) (GKE) is the offering
that is best suited. For more information about deploying containers on GKE.
see the following documents:
