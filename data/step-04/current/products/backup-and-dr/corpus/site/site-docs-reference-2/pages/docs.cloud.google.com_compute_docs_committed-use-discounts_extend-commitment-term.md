Extend commitment terms
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides information about extending the term of your
Compute Engine hardware resource-based commitments
beyond the preset 1- and 3-year options.
Term extensions give you the flexibility to extend a commitment's term
beyond the preset 1 or 3 years and specify a custom term duration of your
choice—for example, 2, 3.5, or 5.5 years. By extending your commitment's
term, you can tailor your commitment's term to match your resource usage needs
and keep receiving the resulting committed use discounts (CUDs) for that longer
and custom duration. You can extend the terms of both 1-year and
3-year commitments as follows:
1-year commitments : You can specify custom term durations that are
greater than 1 year and less than 3 years.
3-year commitments : You can specify custom term durations that are
greater than 3 years and less than 6 years.
For other ways to keep your commitments active for a longer duration, see the
following alternatives:
If you have a 1-year commitment and you want a higher discount
rate in addition to a longer term, then
upgrade your commitment .
If you want your commitment to automatically renew for one or more full
terms, then
enable auto-renewal on your commitment .
How term extension works
A commitment is active for a specific period, defined by its start and end
dates, known as its term . If a commitment has auto-renewal enabled, it begins
a new term each time it renews. When you perform a term extension, you are
modifying the end date of only the commitment's ongoing term —the term
that is active when you request the extension.
You can extend a commitment's ongoing term and set a custom term duration by
specifying a future end date of your choice.
Your commitment then becomes a custom term commitment. For 1-year
commitments, the custom end date can be anywhere between 1 and 3 years (but
can't be exactly 3 years) after the start date of the ongoing term. For 3-year
commitments, the custom end date can be anywhere between 3 and 6 years (but
can't be exactly 6 years) after the start date of the ongoing term.
You can perform a term extension for both new and existing commitments as
follows:
New commitments : You can
specify a custom end date when you purchase the commitment .
Existing commitments : After your commitment becomes active, you can
specify or update the custom end date by updating the commitment's properties .
After you place a term extension request for your commitment, the changes take
effect at 12 AM US and Canadian Pacific Time (UTC-8, or UTC-7 during daylight
saving time) on the following day. Your commitment remains active until the new
custom end date and its term gets adjusted accordingly. Extending your
commitment's term doesn't affect the other properties of the commitment:
Name
Start date
Region
Project
Commitment type
Commitment plan
Auto-renewal setting
Committed resources
Extending your commitment's term doesn't change the CUD rate
that you receive in return for that commitment.
Any reservations that are attached to your commitment
continue to exist throughout the lifetime of your extended term, unless you
manually replace them.
Term extension eligibility window
After a commitment's term begins, you have a limited time period during which
you can request a term extension. This time period is called the
term extension eligibility window .
Regardless of whether the commitment has a preset or custom term duration, the
term extension eligibility window depends on the most recent operation that you
performed on the commitment. Depending on the operation, the term extension
eligibility window applies in the following ways:
Newly purchased commitments : For 1-year commitments, the eligibility
window remains open up to four months after the commitment activation. For
3-year commitments, the eligibility window remains open up to one year after
the commitment activation.
Auto-renewed commitments : If your commitment automatically renews for a
new term, then the eligibility window refreshes at the start of the renewed
term. For 1-year commitments, the eligibility window remains open up to four
months from the start of the renewed term. For 3-year commitments, the
eligibility window remains open up to one year from the start of the renewed
term.
Merged commitments : If you merge commitments that have different
eligibility windows, then, for the merged commitment, Compute Engine
uses the eligibility window that ends the earliest.
Split commitments : When you split a commitment, the eligibility window
remains the same for both the resized source commitment and the new split
commitment.
Upgraded commitments : When you upgrade a 1-year commitment into a
3-year commitment, Compute Engine also updates the eligibility
window for the commitment. The updated window remains open up to 1 year
from the start of the ongoing term.
For example, suppose that your 1-year commitment's start date is January
1, 2024. The eligibility window for your original 1-year term remains open
until May 1, 2024. Suppose that you then upgraded this commitment to a
3-year commitment on April 1, 2024. After the upgrade, your
commitment's updated eligibility window remains open until January 1, 2025.
Performing multiple term extensions
You can extend the term of your commitment any number of times within the
term extension eligibility window. On any given day, for any given active
commitment, you can place multiple term extension requests until 12 AM US and
Canadian Pacific Time (UTC-8 or UTC-7) of the next day, as long as you specify
a later end date each time. However, Google recommends that you minimize
the number of term extension requests that you place for a single commitment on
a given day.
After your term extension for a specific end date takes effect and your
commitment has a new custom end date, you can't undo the term extension or
reduce the duration of your commitment's term. You can perform subsequent
extension operations only for end dates that are later than the most recently
specified end date.
Impact of pending commitment update requests
For existing, active commitments that already have a pending update request, you
can place a new term extension request only if the pending request is also for a
term extension. If the commitments have any pending update requests—such
as merge, split, upgrade, or auto-renewal setting update—then, to
request term extensions, you must wait for the pending operations to complete
and the updates to take effect. After 12 AM US and
Canadian Pacific Time (UTC-8 or UTC-7) on the following day, when the updates
take effect, you can request a term extension for that commitment.
Pricing implications
Your commitment fee is the sum of the discounted prices of all your committed
resources. When you extend your commitment's term, the discounted prices
of your resources stay the same for the entirety of your custom term,
even if the on-demand prices change. For more information about resource prices,
see Compute Engine pricing
Note: If you merge or split your commitments, then the discounted prices for
your committed resources might change on the day that your merged or split
commitments become active.
Quota considerations
To specify a custom end date while purchasing a commitment, you must have
sufficient
quota available both for the commitment and the committed resources .
To specify a custom end date for an existing commitment, you don't typically
need to request any additional quota.
How term extension affects future commitment operations
If your commitment has a custom term duration, then performing any subsequent
commitment management operations on your custom term commitment might affect its
custom end date and eligibility window. The following sections explain how a
custom term commitment behaves during other commitment operations:
Auto-renewing custom term commitments
The renewed term length of an automatically renewing commitment always matches the
preset term length defined by the commitment's plan, which is either 1 year or 3
years. You also receive the same discount percentage. Even if your commitment
has a
custom term length , Compute Engine renews your commitment only
for its preset term length of either 1 or 3 years. Auto-renewal of a custom
term commitment won't be for another term of that custom length. For
examples, see the following:
A commitment with a custom term of 1.5 years will renew only for 1
additional year.
A commitment with a custom term of 5.5 years will renew only for 3
additional years.
If you want a custom term commitment to stay active for a longer time period
than the renewed term, then you can request for another term extension after its
renewal. Your term extension eligibility window also gets refreshed at the start
of your renewed term. For a 1-year commitment, the eligibility window during the
renewed term remains open for up to 4 months after the renewal. For 3-year
commitments, this window remains open for up to 1 year after the renewal.
For example, suppose that your 1-year commitment's start date was January 1,
2024. You extend the term of this commitment and specify a custom end date of
June 30, 2025. If you also enabled auto-renewal on your commitment, then, on
July 1, 2025, your commitment gets renewed for another term of 1 year. The end
date of the renewed term will be June 30, 2026. The term extension eligibility
window during that renewed term remains open until November 1, 2025.
For more information about auto-renewal of commitments, see
Renew commitments automatically .
Merging custom term commitments
Merge operations behave the same way for both commitments with custom term
durations and preset term durations. The merged commitment inherits
the following properties:
The end date that is furthest in the future among the source commitments,
regardless of whether it's a custom end date.
The eligibility window that ends the earliest among the source commitments.
For example, suppose you want to merge two custom term 1-year commitments. The
first commitment has a start date of January 1, 2024, and has a custom end date
of June 30, 2025. The eligibility window for the first commitment remains open
until May 1, 2024. The second commitment has a start date of February 1, 2024,
and a custom end date of July 30, 2025. The eligibility window for the second
commitment remains open until June 1, 2024. If you merge these commitments on
April 1, 2024, then the merged commitment inherits July 30, 2025 as its end
date. The eligibility window for the merged commitment remains open until May 1,
2024.
For more information about merging commitments, see
Merging commitments .
Splitting custom term commitments
Split operations behave the same way for both commitments with custom term
durations and preset term durations. The resized source commitment and the
new split commitments retain the same custom end date and term extension
eligibility window.
For example, suppose that your 1-year commitment's start date is January 1,
2024, and has a custom end date of June 30, 2025. The eligibility window for
your commitment remains open until May 1, 2024. Suppose that on March 1, 2024,
you split this commitment into two separate commitments. The newly split
commitments inherit the custom end date of June 30, 2025, and their eligibility
windows remain open until May 1, 2024.
For more information about splitting commitments, see
Splitting commitments .
Upgrading custom term commitments
You can upgrade 1-year commitments that have custom term durations. This works
the same way as upgrading commitments that have preset term durations. When you
upgrade a 1-year commitment with a custom term duration, Compute Engine
does the following:
Changes the commitment's plan to 3-years
Moves the end date of the commitment's ongoing term by two years into the
future.
For example, suppose that your 1-year commitment has a start date of January
1, 2024, and has a custom end date of June 30, 2025. The eligibility window for
your original 1-year term remains open until May 1, 2024. If you upgrade this
commitment on April 1, 2024, then the commitment changes to a 3-year commitment
with an end date of June 30, 2027. The commitment's updated eligibility window
remains open until January 1, 2025. You also start receiving the CUD rate that
is applicable for a 3-year commitment.
For more information about upgrading commitments, see
Upgrade commitments .
Limitations
The following limitations apply to term extensions of resource-based
commitments:
You can extend the terms of only hardware resource commitments.
You can't extend the terms of inactive or expired commitments.
For 1-year commitments, you can't specify a custom end date that results
in a total commitment term of 3 years or longer. Instead, consider
changing your commitment's plan from a 1-year to 3-year by
upgrading your commitment .
For 3-year commitments, you can't specify a custom end date that results
in a total commitment term of 6 years or longer.
Instead, consider
enabling auto-renewal on your commitment .
Auto-renewal enables your commitment to renew for another term of 3 full
years.
When a custom term commitment renews, the new term has the 1-year or
3-year duration that is defined by the commitment's plan, rather than the
custom duration.
For existing active commitments that already have a pending commitment
update request, you can place a new term extension request only if the
pending request is also for a term extension. If the commitments have any
other pending update requests—such as merge, split, upgrade, or
auto-renewal setting update—then, to request term extensions, you must
wait until after 12 AM US and Canadian Pacific Time (UTC-8 or UTC-7)
on the following day for the pending operations to complete and the updates
to take effect.
Requirements
You must meet the following requirements to successfully extend the term
of a commitment:
The term extension request must be placed during the term extension
eligibility window for the commitment.
For 1-year commitments, the custom end date must be between 1 and 3
years (but can't be exactly 3 years) into the future from the start date of
the ongoing term.
For 3-year commitments, the custom end date must be between 3 and 6
years (but can't be exactly 6 years) into the future from the start date of
the ongoing term.
You mustn't have any other ongoing or pending merge, split, upgrade, or
renewal operations for that commitment.
Best practices
Google recommends that you follow these best practices when you extend a
commitment's term:
Before you place a term extension request, wait for all other pending
commitment operations to complete and the updates to take effect.
Minimize the number of term extension requests that you place for a single
commitment on the same day.
Extend the term when you purchase the commitment
When you purchase a commitment, you can specify a custom end date to extend the
preset 1- or 3-year term.
