Compute-optimized machine family for Compute Engine
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Compute-optimized instances are ideal for compute-intensive and high
performance computing (HPC) workloads. Compute-optimized instances offer the
highest performance per core and are built on architecture that utilizes
features like non-uniform memory access (NUMA) for optimal, reliable, and
uniform performance.
Note: For the C3, C3D, C4, C4D, or C4A machine series, see

The following machine series are available in this machine family:
H4D instances are powered by Titanium
and fifth generation AMD EPYC Turin processors which have a base
frequency of 2.7 GHz and a maximum frequency of 4.1 GHz. H4D
instances have 192 cores (vCPUs) and up to 1,488 GB of memory. H4D
instances can be used with Local SSD storage and Cloud RDMA
networking.
H3 instances are powered by Titanium
and two fourth generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors (code-named
Sapphire Rapids) which have an all-core frequency of
3.0 GHz. H3 instances have 88 vCPUs and 352 GB of DDR5 memory.
C2D instances run on the third generation AMD EPYC Milan processor and offer
up to 3.5 GHz max boost frequency. C2D instances have flexible sizing
between 2 to 112 vCPUs and 2 to 8 GB of memory per vCPU.
C2 instances run on the second generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor
(Cascade Lake) which offers up to 3.9 GHz sustained single-core max
turbo frequency. C2 offers instances with 4 to 60 vCPUs and 4 GB of
memory per vCPU.
H4D machine series
H4D instances are powered by the AMD EPYC Turin 5th Generation processors and
Titanium
offload processors.
H4D instances deliver high performance, low cost, and scalability for
multi-node workloads. H4D instances are single-threaded and are optimized for
tightly-coupled applications that scale across multiple nodes. Leveraging
technologies like Titanium SSD, RDMA-enabled 200 Gbps networking and
cluster management capabilities, these instances prioritize performance and
workload-specific optimizations. Additionally, you can use
Dynamic Workload Scheduler
for scheduled or immediate cluster deployment, making H4D ideal for HPC
bursty workload needs.
An H4D instance uses all the vCPUs on an entire host server. H4D instances can
use the entire host network bandwidth and come with a default network bandwidth
rate of up to 200 Gbps. However, the bandwidth from the instance to the
internet is limited to 1 Gbps.
Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is disabled for H4D instances and can't be
enabled. There is also no overcommitting to ensure optimal performance
consistency.
H4D instances are available on-demand, or with one- and three-year committed use
discounts (CUDs). To compare these methods, see
Compute Engine instances provisioning models .
H4D Limitations
The H4D machine series has the following restrictions:
The H4D machine types are only available in a predefined machine type.
Custom machine types aren't available.
You can't use GPUs with H4D instances.
Outbound data transfer is limited to 1 Gbps.
You can't create machine images from H4D instances.
H4D machine images can't be used to
create disks .
You can't share disks between instances, either in
multi-writer mode
or read-only mode .
Hyperdisk Balanced performance is capped at 15,000 IOPS and
240 MBps throughput.
Live migration isn't supported for H4D instances.

Supported disk types for H4D
H4D instances can use the following block storage types:
Hyperdisk Balanced ( hyperdisk-balanced )
Local Titanium SSD
Disk and capacity limits
The following restrictions apply:
The number of Hyperdisk volumes can't exceed
64 per VM.
The maximum total disk capacity across all disks can't
exceed 512 TiB.

Network support for H4D instances
H4D instances require
gVNIC network interfaces .
H4D supports up to 200 Gbps network bandwidth for
standard networking. Instance to Internet egress bandwidth is limited to
1 Gbps.
If using Cloud RDMA, you must configure at least two network
interfaces (vNICs) when you create each instance:
GVNIC: This vNIC uses the gVNIC driver and is used for normal networking
communication. It is fully connected to the Google network and can connect to
the Internet.
IRDMA: The other vNIC uses an Intel iDPF/iRDMA driver and is used only
for Cloud RDMA communication. This network interface doesn't connect
to the Internet.
Before migrating to H4D or creating H4D instances,
make sure that the
operating system image
that you use is fully supported for H4D.
Fully supported images include support for 200 Gbps network bandwidth .
If you are using Cloud RDMA, then the OS image must also support the
IRDMA network interface type .
If your H4D instance is using an operating system that is not fully
supported or has earlier versions of the network drivers, then your instance
might not be able to achieve the maximum network bandwidth for H4D
instances.
Maintenance experience for H4D instances
During the lifecycle of a
Compute Engine instance , the host machine that your instance runs on undergoes multiple
host events .
A host event can include the regular maintenance of
Compute Engine infrastructure, or in rare cases, a host error. Compute Engine also
applies some non-disruptive lightweight upgrades for the hypervisor and network
in the background.
The H4D machine series offers the following features related to host
maintenance:

Compute Engine might occasionally perform maintenance more frequently.
H3 machine series
H3 instances are powered by the fourth generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors
(code-named Sapphire Rapids), DDR5 memory, and
Titanium
offload processors.
H3 instances offer the best price performance for compute-intensive high
performance computing (HPC) workloads in Compute Engine. H3 instances are
single-threaded and are ideal for a variety of
modeling and simulation workloads including computational fluid dynamics, crash
safety, genomics, financial modeling, and general scientific and engineering
computing. H3 instances support compact placement, which is optimized for
tightly-coupled applications that scale across multiple nodes.
The H3 series is available in one size, comprising an entire host server.
To save on licensing costs, you can customize the number of visible cores, but
you are charged the same price for the instance. H3 instances can use the entire
host network bandwidth and come with a default network bandwidth rate of up
to 200 Gbps. However, the bandwidth from the instance to the
internet is limited to 1 Gbps.
Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is disabled for H3 instances and can't be
enabled. There is also no overcommitting to ensure optimal performance
consistency.
H3 instances are available on-demand, or with one- and three-year committed use
discounts (CUDs). H3 instances can be used with Google Kubernetes Engine.
H3 Limitations
The H3 machine series has the following restrictions:
The H3 machine series is only available in a predefined machine type.
Custom machine shapes aren't available.
You can't use GPUs with H3 instances.
Outbound data transfer is limited to 1 Gbps.
Persistent Disk and Google Cloud Hyperdisk performance is capped at 15,000 IOPS and
240 MBps throughput.
H3 instances don't support machine images .
H3 instances support only the NVMe storage interface .
H3 instance images can't be used to create disks .
H3 instances don't support sharing disks between instances, either in multi-writer mode
or read-only mode .

Supported disk types for H3
H3 instances can use the following block storage types:
Balanced Persistent Disk ( pd-balanced )
Hyperdisk Balanced ( hyperdisk-balanced )
Hyperdisk Throughput ( hyperdisk-throughput )
Disk and capacity limits
If supported by the machine type, you can attach a mixture of
Hyperdisk and Persistent Disk volumes to an instance, but the following
restrictions apply:
The combined number of both Hyperdisk and Persistent Disk
volumes can't exceed 128 per instance.
The maximum total disk capacity (in TiB) across all disk types can't
exceed:
512 TiB for all Hyperdisk
512 TiB for a mixture of Hyperdisk and
Persistent Disk
257 TiB for all Persistent Disk
For details about the capacity limits, see

Network support for H3 instances
H3 instances require
gVNIC network interfaces .
H3 supports up to 200 Gbps network bandwidth for
standard networking.
Before migrating to H3 or creating H3 instances,
make sure that the operating system image
that you use supports the gVNIC driver. To get the best possible performance on
H3 instances, on the Networking features
tab of the OS details table, choose an OS image that supports both
"Tier_1 Networking" and "200 Gbps network bandwidth". These images include an
updated gVNIC driver, even if the guest OS shows the gve driver version as
1.0.0. If your H3 instance is using an operating system with an older
version of the gVNIC driver, this is still supported but the instance might
experience suboptimal performance such as less network bandwidth or higher
latency.
If you use a custom OS image with the H3 machine series, you can
manually
install the most recent gVNIC driver .
The gVNIC driver version v1.4.2 or later is recommended for use with H3
instances. Google recommends using the latest gVNIC driver version to benefit
from additional features and bug fixes.
Maintenance experience for H3 instances
During the lifecycle of a
Compute Engine instance , the host machine that your instance runs on undergoes multiple
host events .
A host event can include the regular maintenance of
Compute Engine infrastructure, or in rare cases, a host error. Compute Engine also
applies some non-disruptive lightweight upgrades for the hypervisor and network
in the background.

C2D machine series
The C2D machine series provides the largest instance sizes and are best-suited for
high performance computing (HPC). The C2D series also has the largest available
last-level cache (LLC) cache per core.
The C2D machine series comes in different machine types ranging from 2 to 112
vCPUs, and offer up to 896 GB of memory. You can attach up to 3 TiB of
Local SSD storage to these machine types for applications that require higher
storage performance.
C2D standard and C2D high-cpu machines serve existing compute-bound workloads
including high-performance web servers, media transcoding, and gaming.
C2D high-memory machines serve specialized workloads such as HPC and EDA,
which need more memory.
The C2D series supports these compute-bound workloads by using the third
generation AMD EPYC Milan platform.
The C2D series supports
Confidential VM .
C2D Limitations
The C2D machine series has the following restrictions:
You can't attach regional persistent disks
to a C2D instance.

Balanced Persistent Disk ( pd-balanced )
SSD (performance) Persistent Disk ( pd-ssd )
Each C2D instance can have a maximum of 128 Persistent Disk volumes (including the
boot disk) attached to the instance, and a total of 257 GiB disk capacity.
C2D instances with Confidential Computing running Microsoft Windows with
the NVMe disk interface have a disk attachment limitation of 16 disks. See
Known issues
for details.
Note: Persistent Disk usage is charged separately from
machine type pricing .
Network support for C2D instances

C2 machine series
The C2 machine series provides full transparency into the architecture of the
underlying server platforms, letting you fine-tune the performance. Machine
types in this series offer much more computing power, and are generally more
robust for compute-intensive workloads compared to N1 high-CPU machine types.
The C2 series comes in different machine types ranging from 4 to 60 vCPUs, and
offers up to 240 GB of memory. You can attach up to 3 TiB of Local SSD
storage to these instances for applications that require higher storage performance.
This series also produces a greater than 40% performance improvement
compared to the previous generation N1 machines and offer higher performance per
thread and isolation for latency-sensitive workloads.
The C2 series enables the highest performance per core and the highest frequency
for compute-bound workloads using Intel 3.9 GHz Cascade Lake processors. If
you are looking to optimize workloads for
single thread performance ,
particularly with respect to floating point, choose a machine type in this
series to take advantage of AVX-512 capabilities only available on Intel.
C2 Limitations
The C2 machine series has the following restrictions:
You cannot use regional persistent disks .
The C2 machine series is subject to different
