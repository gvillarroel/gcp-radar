View autoscaler logs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
When you enable autoscaling, the autoscaler makes scaling decisions based on the
options that you specify. Each scaling decision is logged by
Cloud Logging . Read these logs in the
Logs Explorer to better understand
the autoscaler's scaling decisions.
Using the Logs Explorer, you can see events related to:
Autoscaler recommendation for resizing a managed instance group (MIG). If the
autoscaler calculates a new recommended size for a MIG, the change in the
recommended size is described in the autoscaler logs. See
Resize log entry .
Changes in autoscaler status. For example, if the autoscaler was working as
expected but then encountered an issue, the change in status would
be described in the autoscaler logs. See Status change log entry .
Before you begin
Read the Autoscaling documentation.
Have an active autoscaler for which you want to view logs.
Review how to use the Logs Explorer .
If you haven't already, set up authentication .
Authentication verifies your identity for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run
code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to
Compute Engine by selecting one of the following options:
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
gcloud
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
Set a default region and zone .
REST
To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the
credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using REST
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
View autoscaler logs
To view autoscaler logs, use the Google Cloud console, the
gcloud CLI, or REST.
Console
If you've turned on autoscaling, then you can see autoscaling logs in the
Google Cloud console .
Go to the Logs Explorer page.
Go to Logs Explorer
Pull down the Resource drop-down menu and select Autoscaler .
You can also navigate to the Logs Explorer page from your MIG as
follows:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Instance groups page.
Go to Instance groups
Click the name of the MIG for which you want to view the logs.
Click Monitoring tab.
In the Monitoring tab, the Logs panel is at the bottom of the
page. Expand the panel by clicking the
keyboard_capslock Toggle panel "Logs"
at the end of this panel.
To open the Logs explorer page, click
open_in_new View in logs explorer .
The log explorer opens with a default query to fetch all autoscaler logs
of the MIG.
gcloud
To look up all logs related to autoscaling, use the
logging read command .
For example:
gcloud logging read "resource.type=autoscaler" --limit 10 \
--format json
To view the autoscaler logs of a specific MIG, specify the
instance_group_manager_name as follows:
gcloud logging read "resource.type=autoscaler AND \
resource.labels.instance_group_manager_name=example-igm " \
--limit 10 --format json
To view the log entries related to autoscaler
resize actions , specify the compute.autoscalers.resize method
name:
gcloud logging read "resource.type=autoscaler AND \
resource.labels.instance_group_manager_name=example-igm AND \
protoPayload.methodName=compute.autoscalers.resize" \
--limit 10 --format json
To view the log entries related to autoscaler
status changes , specify the compute.autoscalers.changeStatus
method name:
gcloud logging read "resource.type=autoscaler AND \
resource.labels.instance_group_manager_name=example-igm AND \
protoPayload.methodName=compute.autoscalers.changeStatus" \
--limit 10 --format json
REST
Make a request to the
Logging V2 API .
The request body must contain the filter parameter to use when searching
for logs and the project you want to view logs for. For example, to make
a request to get a list of resize actions of a specific MIG:
POST https://logging.googleapis.com/v2/entries:list
{
"filter": "resource.type=autoscaler AND
resource.labels.instance_group_manager_name=example-igm AND
protoPayload.methodName=compute.autoscalers.resize",
"pageSize": 10,
"resourceNames": [
"projects/example-project"
]
}
To make a request to get a list of status changes of a specific MIG:
POST https://logging.googleapis.com/v2/entries:list
{
"filter": "resource.type=autoscaler AND
resource.labels.instance_group_manager_name=example-igm AND
protoPayload.methodName=compute.autoscalers.changeStatus",
"pageSize": 10,
"resourceNames": [
"projects/example-project"
]
}
Resize log entry
When the autoscaler calculates a
recommended size for your MIG,
Compute Engine creates a log entry. This entry includes the new and
old recommended sizes, and the reason for the change in recommendation.
The following is an example of a log entry for a zonal MIG. In this example,
based on predictive autoscaling the autoscaler calculated 3 VMs to achieve the
CPU utilization target of 35% . But, the maximum number of instances
configured in the autoscaling policy is only 2 . So, the autoscaler limits the
recommended size to 2 .

utilization across 1 serving instance will be 103.533%, which is above
the utilization target of 35%. The calculated size was 3 to achieve
the target CPU utilization but the size was limited by the maximum
number of instances set in the autoscaling policy."

The following table describes the fields from the log entry:
Property
Value
autoscalingMode
The autoscaling mode
at the time when the entry was logged. Regardless of the mode, the
autoscaler calculates the
recommended size ,
which is represented by newSize in the log. Depending on
the autoscaling mode, the autoscaler resizes the MIG as follows:
ON : The autoscaler resizes the MIG to newSize .
OFF : The autoscaler does not resize the MIG.
ONLY_SCALE_OUT : The autoscaler resizes the MIG only if
newSize is greater than the target size of the MIG.
autoscalingReason
Details about the reason for autoscaling.
autoscalingReason.scalingLimit
Details about the autoscaling feature that limited the
calculatedSize , which is the size that autoscaler calculated
based on the autoscaling signal. The autoscaling features that can limit
the calculatedSize are maximum or minimum number of
instances, the scale-in controls ,
or the stabilization period .
If no limit applies to calculatedSize , then the
scalingLimit field does not appear in the logs.
autoscalingReason.scalingLimit.limitPolicy
The configuration of the autoscaling
feature that limited the calculatedSize . The
limitPolicy field is not set when stabilization limits the
calculatedSize because stabilization is a
default feature of autoscaling.
autoscalingReason.scalingLimit.limitSize
The number of VMs based on the autoscaling
feature that limited the calculatedSize .
autoscalingReason.scalingLimit.name
The name of the autoscaling feature that limited the
calculatedSize .
autoscalingReason.scalingSignal
Details about the autoscaling signal that is used to calculate the
number of VMs the MIG should have. If the autoscaling policy has
multiple signals ,
then the autoscaler considers the signal that requires the
largest number of VMs.
autoscalingReason.scalingSignal.calculatedSize
The number of VMs that the MIG should have based on the autoscaling
signal. If scalingLimit applies, then the autoscaler limits
calculatedSize to scalingLimit.limitSize .
autoscalingReason.scalingSignal.calculationDetails
Details used to determine the calculatedSize .
servingSize : The number of VMs in the MIG excluding the
VMs that are still in their
initialization period .
signalTarget : The target value that the autoscaler
maintains for CPU utilization (real-time), predicted CPU utilization,
load balancing utilization, or a metric configured with utilization
target.
singleInstanceAssignment : If scaling is based on a
metric value that represents the total amount of work to be done, then
singleInstanceAssignment is the quantity of work that
each VM can handle.
signalValue : The value of the autoscaling signal. If
signalTarget is set, then the autoscaler compares the
signalValue with the signalTarget to
calculate how many VMs are needed, which is represented by
calculatedSize .
autoscalingReason.scalingSignal.name
The name of the autoscaling signal based on which the autoscaler
calculated the number of VMs, represented by calculatedSize
in the log.
autoscalingReason.scalingSignal.signalPolicy
The configuration of the autoscaling signal based on which the
autoscaler determined the calculatedSize .
autoscalingReason.summary
A description of the reason for autoscaling.
newSize
The current recommended size of the MIG. Depending on the
autoscalingMode , the autoscaler resizes the MIG to the
newSize as follows:
ON : The autoscaler resizes the MIG to newSize .
OFF : The autoscaler does not resize the MIG.
ONLY_SCALE_OUT : The autoscaler resizes the MIG only if
newSize is greater than the target size of the MIG.
oldSize
The previous recommended size of the MIG.
For information about the other fields in the log entry, see
Format of audit log entries .
Status change log entry
When the status of the autoscaler changes, Compute Engine creates
a log entry capturing the old and new status messages. You can use these status
messages to find out why your autoscaler is not behaving as you expect or to
debug past issues you noticed. For some of the common status messages, see
Commonly returned status messages .
The following fields in the
protoPayload describe the old and new statuses:
metadata.newStatus.details : The new status of the autoscaler.
metadata.oldStatus.details : The previous status of the autoscaler.
The following is an example of a log entry that describes a status change. In
this example, you might notice the new status message indicating problems with
your load balancing configuration.
{
insertId: "ivho6kg4icqfio"
logName: "projects/example-project/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem_event"
protoPayload: {
metadata: {
@type: "type.googleapis.com/autoscaler.AutoscalerStatusChange"
newStatus : {
details: "The autoscaler is configured to scale based on a load
balancing signal but the instance group has not received any
utilization data from the load balancer or the utilization is
constantly 0. Check that the load balancing configuration is
working"
}
oldStatus : {
details: "OK"
