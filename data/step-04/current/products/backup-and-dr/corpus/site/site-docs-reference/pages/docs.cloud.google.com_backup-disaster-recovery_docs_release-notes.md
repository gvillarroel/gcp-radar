Announcement
We're excited to announce the launch of Editable Backup Plans, a new feature designed to give you more flexibility and control over your data protection strategy. You can now modify your existing backup plans directly, eliminating the need to create new plans and reassign them when your requirements change. This makes it easier than ever to adapt to evolving business needs, optimize for cost, and correct configuration errors on the fly.
What's new:
Directly Edit Key Settings: You can now change the description, schedule, backup window, and retention periods of your existing backup plans. You can also add or remove backup rules as needed.
Automatic Updates: Once a plan is edited, the changes are automatically applied to all resources protected by that plan for all future backups. There's no need to manually detach and reattach the plan.
Backward Compatibility: This new capability is available for all backup plans, including those created before this update.
Important Note: While most settings in a backup plan are now editable, the assigned backup vault cannot be changed. To store backups in a different vault, a new backup plan must be created.
June 16, 2025

February 26, 2025
Announcement
Backup and DR Service 11.0.14.302 is now available to update your backup/recovery appliance. Refer to these instructions to update your appliance.
Backup and DR Service 11.0.14.302 includes the following fixes and improvements:
The following CVEs have been addressed in this hotfix: CVE-2024-42301, CVE-2024-42284, CVE-2024-41092
In some cases, a database that has data on multiple volumes can be mounted successfully, but a subsequent unmount operation fails. This has been fixed.
In rare cases, the management console could lose the connection to the backup appliance for up to an hour, after which it automatically recovered. During the disconnection, the scheduled backups continued to be taken but the jobs monitor could not show progress and new on-demand jobs could not be run. This has been fixed.
A Db2 log backup to a full disk failed without notification. With this hotfix, upon failure the disk is resized and the backup job is retried successfully.
A persistent disk backup job for an SAP HANA or an IBM Db2 database fails if the backup/recovery appliance includes another host with the same name in a different project. This has been fixed.
Imported persistent disk snapshots of SAP HANA and Db2 databases sometimes failed to mount or to restore if the database host had a custom (non-default) PD disk names. This fix ensures that these imported databases can be successfully mounted and restored.
For SAP IQ databases, the INC_BKP.1 file (a config file) is backed up. It can be a large file that consumes much storage, so starting with this hotfix the config file is compressed for backup.
Recovery of an IBM Db2 database from a standby image sometimes failed. This has been fixed.
Backup and DR now supports "Import without ownership" for SAP HANA and IBM Db2 databases and logs.

Fixed
Fixes for Oracle databases backed up to OnVault and backup vault
Hosts from both source and remote backup appliances are now listed in the restore page. For cases when no host is reachable or the primary backup appliance is down, the UI was improved by showing a spinning wheel to avoid waiting for longer than necessary while attempting to restore from an imported image.
A Replace Original Application Identity option has been added for Oracle traditional restore functionality.
Feature
For updates to the backup appliance, a default window now exists to schedule non disruptive patch updates. (Disruptive updates do not get the default window.) You will now receive notifications 2 weeks , 1 week and 24 hours before the scheduled update after which the appliance will be automatically updated. An option to reschedule non disruptive patch updates is also available.
Fixed
Fixes for SAP HANA Persistent Disk Snapshots
Enhancing imports of log images: Log images can now be imported correctly with the right recovery range. Enabled importing log images without having to take the ownership of the images. Fixed the workflow for importing on the source management server instance and another new management server instance.
UI fixes for point-in-time recovery from imported images: Imported images appear in the remote snapshot lane in access view, populating correct recovery range for imported images, populating recovery time in restore operation request, adding archive log mount point location in restore page, disabling Replace Original Application Identity for remote images, mount page waiting indefinitely for imported image, adding import PD snapshot option in application page, enabling host selection drop-downs for replication cluster etc.
BA fixes: Issues with uploading metadata for replication clusters and with point-in-time recovery from imported images were fixed.

Announcement
Backup and DR Service hotfixes hf-11.0.12.3217 , hf-11.0.12.3218 , and hf-11.0.12.3219 automatically update backup/recovery appliances. These hotfixes address the following issues:
Oracle DB application backups wait indefinitely for in-progress log backups to complete. These log backups, in turn, cannot obtain a lock mutex to discover the backup staging LUNs, resulting in an indefinite hang. This issue occurs when the size of the application transaction logs exceeds the log backup staging size.
Cloud stats are repeatedly logged into the enginemgr log and increase log usage.

Announcement
Backup and DR Service 11.0.9.429 is now available to update your backup/recovery appliance. Refer to these instructions to update your appliance.
Announcement
The upcoming 11.0.10 release includes an important OS change. If your backup appliance was originally installed as version 11.0.5 or older (before July 2023), then the 11.0.9 upgrade includes an additional automated procedure to prepare for the coming upgrade by making some adjustments to the backup appliance's boot disk partitions. This additional procedure takes about 30 minutes.
If the upgrade is disrupted, there is a chance that the backup/recovery appliance might become non-functional. To prepare for this risk, it is highly recommended that you take a snapshot of the backup appliance boot disk before upgrading the appliance to 11.0.9. If the backup appliance is not back online after the upgrade, contact the Backup and DR support team. Here is a brief guide for how to take the snapshot:
In the Backup and DR management console, click Manage > Appliances and write down or screen-capture the appliance names.
In the Google Cloud console of your workload project, click Compute Engine > VM instances .
Identify the backup appliance VM instance with the same name as that shown in the Backup and DR management console.
Take a snapshot of the backup appliance boot disk . If you need assistance taking the snapshot, contact the Backup and DR support team .
Contact the Backup and DR support team if the appliance becomes non-functional after the upgrade. The support team will determine the best way to mitigate the problem.
Caution: Do NOT try to restore the bootdisk from the snapshot without assistance from Support. Doing so may damage the appliance and make it unrecoverable.
Delete the snapshot once you confirm that the appliance is online using version 11.0.9.
