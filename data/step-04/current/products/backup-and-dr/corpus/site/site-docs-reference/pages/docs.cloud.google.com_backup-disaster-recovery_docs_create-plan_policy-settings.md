Configure advanced policy settings
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page lists the advanced settings for a backup configuration policy template.
You can define the advanced policy settings while creating a
backup policy .
You can also view and change the policy settings for specific applications by
displaying the policy overrides panel from the Manage Backup Plan page for
the application.
Use the following instructions to view the policy settings page.
In the appliance management console, click the Backup Plans tab and select the
Templates option from the drop-down.
Select the template to manage and then click Edit from the drop-down at
the bottom right corner of the page.
On the template page, on the right side, click the white arrow beside the
policy that you want to manage. At the bottom of the selections, click Edit Policy .
At the bottom of the Create/Edit Policy section click Advanced Policy Settings .
This opens the advanced policy settings detailed in the following table.
When you are finished, click Save Changes to update the settings.
Note: The Policy Overrides settings page might not show all the settings
listed in the following table. It only displays relevant settings
based on your application.
The following table details the advanced policy settings.
Advanced setting
Description
Application consistent
(applicable only for Google Cloud VMware Engine VMs and Compute Engine VMs)
Select one of the following:
Crash consistent backup : Crash consistent backup is a
fast backup of application data in storage as if power were lost at
that moment. It doesn't pause application data I/O. All data on disk
is saved, and data in memory is lost. The recovery of a crash consistent
backup might take longer and introduce exceptions. It might be
required to perform some additional manual recovery steps during the
recovery, depending on the guest OS, file systems, and applications.
Choose crash consistent if the application consistent process causes
issues for your applications or workloads due to the quiescing process.
Crash consistent might result in a longer RTO due to the need for the
file system or application to perform a recovery from the inconsistent
snap, and could even result in an unrecoverable snap in extreme cases.
Take application consistent backup : Application consistent
backup leverages quiesced snapshots, which uses VMware tools or
a Google Cloud guest environment to quiesce the file system of the
virtual machine. A quiesce operation leverages Windows operating
built-in capabilities to quiesce file systems and applications that
support VSS. It also leverages any customer supplied freeze or thaw
scripts (on all platforms) to get higher level application
consistency. The result is a higher confidence level in the
recoverability of the backup, as well as shorter recovery times in
most cases. Application consistent backups can sometimes cause a
brief pause in I/O, and while uncommon, some busier applications might
report I/O errors at the time of the backup. Occasionally,
application consistent backups fails if VMware is unable to
quiesce the VM within a predetermined timeout during the snapshot
operation. Use application consistent backups when recoverability is
most important, and the applications in the VM aren't sensitive to
the brief I/O pause.
Read the Create a Linux application consistent persistent disk snapshot
section for more information.
To mount a Windows Compute Engine snapshot as a new or an
existing VM that is captured with the Application consistent
option, you must change the disk from read-only to read-write mode.
To do this, follow the instructions in Optional: Mark
your disk as available for read and write .
Take crash consistent backup on last try :
This option initially takes application consistent backups,
but if an application consistent backup fails for any reason,
it takes a crash consistent backup.
Snapshot location
(applicable only for Compute Engine and SAP HANA instances)
Select the region where the Persistent Disk snapshots are to be stored.
By default, multi-region is selected (based on the source disk location).
You can also change the snapshot storage location to a different region
than the source disk region. When storing snapshots in a location that
is different from the location of your source disk, the data travels
over the network between those locations and might incur network fees.
Snapshots incur the same fees as Cloud Storage data transfer. Learn more about the
persistent disk snapshot. To know the pricing details, see disk pricing.
Snapshot type
(applicable only for Compute Engine and SAP HANA instances)
Select the Persistent Disk snapshot type to be used for
Compute Engine instance backups. Snapshots incrementally backup data from
Persistent disks. During backups, a new snapshot is created to capture
the current state of the Persistent disk and later can be used to create
a new disk for mounts or restores. Compute Engine stores multiple copies
of each snapshot across multiple locations with automatic checksums to
ensure the integrity of your data. Learn more about the persistent disk snapshot.
To know the pricing details, see disk pricing.
Standard : By default, the Standard snapshot type is selected.
It is recommended to use the standard type if you want to retain the
backups for less than 90 days.
Archive : Select the Archive type if you want to retain the
backups for long duration. Note that the minimum billing period
for the archive snapshot is 90 days irrespective of the retention
period defined in policy and that Archive type also has an additional
retrieval charge if used in a mount or restore job.
Staging Disk Over-allocation
(In percentage)
Specify the extra space allocated for staging disk
(on top of what's actually needed) to accommodate growth of the
application. This setting is from zero to 1000 percent.
Global Prune Paths
Don't back up these directories (specify full path). Also see the
policy-level Global Prune Paths values.
Compress Streamsnap Replication
By default, compression for streamsnap replication is enabled.
Compression increases the efficiency of the streamsnap replication to the
remote backup/recovery appliance when transferring data over the network,
for example, when replicating images and videos. When compression is
enabled, all of the packets are compressed. The target backup/recovery appliance
decompresses the packets before writing to the staging disk.
If compression isn't needed for streamsnap replication to the
second backup/recovery appliance, then change the compress streamsnap
replication advanced setting to Don't compress and then
click Save Changes .
Note: Streamsnap replication is only supported for the
backup/recovery appliances deployed in a single network.
Do Not Unmap
Specifies if you want temporary staging disks mapped to the host
and used during data movement for backup to remain mapped to the host.
LUNs are mapped during the first job and all the subsequent
jobs reuse the same mapped LUN. Select either:
Keep staging disks mapped between jobs. Select this
option if you want the temporary staging disks mapped to the
host and used during data movement to remain mapped to the host.
LUNs are mapped during the first job and all the subsequent jobs
reuse the same mapped LUN. By default, this option is selected.
Note: For applications managed using the Backup and DR agent
(such as SQL database) where the application is on an OS
running inside a VMware VM, this option is ignored. The staging disk
is always be unmapped from the VM after every job.
Unmap staging disks after each job. This option both
unmounts the staging disk from the operating system at the
conclusion of every job (removing mount points or drive letters),
and also unmaps it from the host altogether. This option
requires the host to perform a scan for SCSI LUNs at the start
of the next job, as the re-mapped staging disks must be
rediscovered before they can be remounted.
Truncate (Purge) Log After Backup
Specify whether to truncate (purge) the database logs after
every backup. When Truncate Log After Backup is enabled,
application-related logs are truncated until the recent or
current backup. If you truncate logs, you must also back up
the transaction log to enable a roll forward recovery.
The options are:
Don't truncate or purge log after backup
Truncate or purge log after backup
Skip Offline Applications
(For Consistency Group management only)
Specify whether to ignore unavailable applications that are part
of a consistency group. You create a consistency group to back
up the data of all member applications together to preserve
consistency of data across the member applications.
Consistency groups are collections of discovered applications
from the same host.
Options are:
Fail backup when offline applications are found
Skip offline applications during backup
Map staging disks to all nodes in an application cluster
If your nodes are in an application cluster, you can use
this to ensure that the nodes of an application cluster
are protected in case of failover during backup.
Don't map staging disk to all nodes of application cluster.
Map staging disk to all nodes of application cluster
In the event of an application cluster failure,
this option protects failover copies.
Map Staging Disk to All ESX Hosts in a Cluster
(For VMware VMs only)
If your ESX servers are in an appliance, you can use this setting to
ensure that the VMs are managed in case of failover during backup. In the
event of an ESX host failure, this option manages failover copies of
VMware VMs. (Oracle, local file systems, SMB, NFS, SQL Server):
Map staging disk to ESX host for VM only
Map staging disk to all ESX hosts in the cluster
Map staging disk to two ESX hosts in the cluster
Backup SQL Server User Logins
Captures the SQL Server database login credentials.
When the database is mounted as a virtual application
(app aware mount) the virtual database has all
of the login credentials used by the source.
The options are Yes or No .
Enable Database Log Backup
The Enable Database Log Backup option allows the
backup plan policy to backup a database and all associated
transaction log files. The logs are backed up when
the log snapshot job runs. Options are Yes or No.
When set to Yes , the related options are enabled.
Note: For details on Log Protection , see
Database Log Protection in a backup plan policy .
RPO
When Enable Database Log Backup is set to
Yes , RPO defines the frequency for database log backup.
Frequency is set in minutes and must not exceed the database backup
interval. The smallest value that can be set (in minutes) is 15.
Log Backup Retention Period
(In Days)
When Enable Database Log Backup is set to
Yes , log retention is defined separately from the
retention of the snapshot policy.
Having a separate retention period lets you use logs in
conjunction with copies of the database stored in the snapshot pool.
The log retention period is a mandatory setting.
Replicate Logs
(Uses Streamsnap Technology)
When Enable Database Log Backup is set to
Enable , the Replicate Logs advanced
setting allows database logs to be replicated to a remote appliance. For a
log replication job to run, there must be streamsnap replication policy
included in the template along with a resource profile that specifies a
remote appliance, and at least one successful replication
of the database must first be completed. You can then use the logs
at the remote site for any database image within the retention
range of the replicated logs. This function is enabled by default.
Log replication uses streamsnap technology to perform the
replication between the local and remote appliances; log
replication goes directly from the local snapshot pool to the
snapshot pool on the remote appliance.
Note: Log replication doesn't occur until database has
been protected and the image replicated to the remote appliance.
Send logs to OnVault Pool
Set to Yes , logs are replicated to one or more
OnVault storage pools enabling for point-in-time recoveries from OnVault
on another site.
Note : If you select this, then Backup and DR sends logs to
every OnVault pool defined in the profile for that application.
If there are two pools in the profile, then the monitor will show
OnVault (log) jobs for each log backup, one for each pool. Only OnVault
pools that are in the profile for that SLA will get the logs.
The retention of logs replicated to OnVault is similar to snapshot log
retention.
Replicating database logs to an OnVault bucket is different from a
database backup. If you select Send logs to OnVault Pool ,
then Backup and DR will continuously replicate the logs to
OnVault buckets similar to log snapshot backups. For example, if a log
backup is taken every 15 minutes, then the logs will be replicated to
OnVault every 15 minutes to ensure all log snapshots are replicated to
OnVault pools.
The policy ID shown in the appliance management console is the
snapshot policy ID as this replication of logs to OnVault buckets is
tied to Snapshot policy.
Note : Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly OnVault policies
are only for database backups, they don't apply to log backups.
Log Staging Disk Growth Size (In Percent)
When Enable Database Log Backup is set to
Yes , Log Staging Disk Growth Size
defines the growth to use when automatically growing
the staging disk on which the logs reside.
This setting is from five to 100 percent.
Estimated Change Rate
When Enable Database Log Backup is set to
Yes , this setting defines the daily change (in percent),
which allows the appliance to better calculate the size of the staging
disk needed to hold logs. This setting is from zero to 100.
Compress Database Log Backup
When Enable Database Log Backup is set to
Yes , this setting instructs the source database to
compress its logs before they are captured by the appliance management console. The
database server performs log compression during log backup. The options
are Yes or No .
When set to Yes , the
Compress Database Log Backup option is enabled.
Enforced Retention
Allows the user to configure their immutability period
between zero and 36525 days. By default, the value is set to zero
for all existing policies.
You can modify a policy that is already used to protect
an application by setting a longer enforced retention period.
However, you can't shorten the enforced retention period.
You can't set enforced retention for a streamsnap policy
whose retention is "Only keep the most recent remote image".
Note: Enforced Retention can't be overridden on a
per-application basis. The option doesn't appear on the
Policy Overrides page.
Note: The Enforced Retention advanced policy
setting is not compatible with application protection that points to a
backup vault. When a backup vault is the storage
target, the backup vault determines the enforced retention period.
Job Behavior When Target VM Needs snapshot Consolidation
Select an action if the VM requires consolidation:
Fail the job if VM needs consolidation:
Point-in-time jobs fail.
Run the job without performing consolidation:
All jobs run normally even if consolidation is pending.
Perform consolidation at the beginning of the job:
Point-in-time jobs try to perform consolidation at the beginning
of the job. If consolidation fails, the job fails with an error message.
Fail On Missing Start Path
If one or more start paths are specified, and any of these start
paths doesn't exist, the job fails with the message UDSAgent:
Specified start path doesn't exist. If no start paths are specified,
this option has no effect. Options are Yes or
No .
Note: The default state for this option is No (disabled),
which is the same behavior of the previous versions of the
Backup and DR agent; the job doesn't fail if a start path
doesn't exist.
Enable Degraded Capture Mode
Degraded capture mode captures incremental data when
Change Block Tracking (CBT) service is unavailable.
Data capture might take longer. The options are Yes or
No .
Script Timeout
(applicable only for agent based backups)
The Backup and DR agent lets you create host-side scripts
that run on an application's host before or after a policy
is run. The four timeouts provided in a policy template map directly
into the four stages of a host-side script.
Note: By default, the script timeout values are per the
following values. If a script timeout isn't specified,
the value is blank and the default is used.
Script Init Timeout : Defines how long a job should
wait for the script that is invoked on the host before any
action is taken by the job. If the script doesn't complete
within this timeout, the job fails. The default value is
60 seconds. Allowed range is one to 86400 seconds.
Script Freeze Timeout : Defines how long a policy
should wait for the script that is invoked in order to freeze
an application, before a snapshot is taken. If the script doesn't
complete within this timeout, the job fails.
The default value is 60 seconds. Allowed range is one to 86400 seconds.
Script Unfreeze Timeout : Defines how long a policy
should wait for the script that is invoked in order to freeze an
application, after a snapshot is taken. If the script doesn't complete
within this timeout, the job fails.
The default value is 60 seconds. Allowed range is one to 86400 seconds.
Script Finish Timeout : Defines how long a policy
should wait for the script that is invoked at the very end
of the job. If the script doesn't complete within this timeout,
the job fails. The default value is 60 seconds.
Allowed range is one to 86400 seconds.
