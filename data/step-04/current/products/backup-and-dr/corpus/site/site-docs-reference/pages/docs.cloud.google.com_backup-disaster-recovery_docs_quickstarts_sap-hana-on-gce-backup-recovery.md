Protect the SAP production environment against data loss, errors, and corruption
SAP HANA is one of the most popular enterprise databases in the world. It's
unique because it runs in-memory, so it can return query results very quickly.
Many enterprises use SAP HANA for their mission critical applications. As can
happen with any database, SAP HANA is susceptible to corruption, accidental
deletion, or even security threats such as ransomware attacks. Backup and DR Service
lets you efficiently and securely back up and recover your production systems.
For an introduction to how you use Backup and DR Service to protect your HANA
databases, see
Backup and DR for SAP HANA .
Note: SAP HANA Scale-Out isn't supported for backup to Persistent Disk snapshots.
Deploy Backup and DR Service first
Before you begin, you must read and complete the following procedures:
Plan a Backup and DR deployment
Prepare to deploy Backup and DR
Deploy Backup and DR
See how Backup and DR Service works
Then see how Backup and DR Service works by going through
Get started with Backup and DR: protect and recover a Compute Engine instance .
Prepare SAP HANA instances for backup
Before you can back up your SAP HANA instances, review the following
preparation steps.
Prerequisites
All the configured services—see SAP Note 1697613 and SAP Note 1649519— such
as nameserver and indexserver must be running. You can check this in the
Overview of SAP HANA studio > Operational State > Confirm all services
are started.
To allow the Backup and DR agent to perform host-side operations, use an SAP HANA
hdbuserstore key instead of a username and password to communicate with the
HANA database using the SAP HANA secure userstore.
Database log_mode must be normal under the HANA Studio configuration tab.
All SAP HANA servers (Compute Engine) that have HANA data to be protected by
Backup and DR Service must have been onboarded to Backup and DR Service
All SAP HANA servers (Compute Engine) that have HANA data to be protected by
Backup and DR Service must have the Backup and DR agent installed.
SAP HANA log backup recommendation:
Make sure to set the SAP HANA log backup path as the basepath_logbackup
and basepath_catalogbackup in global.ini
Don't use the SAP HANA log backup mount to store files other than HANA
archive log backup
By default log purge runs with every database backup. This achieves
the best recovery RTO.
To back up SAP HANA using the Persistent Disk snapshot capture method, the
configuration must follow these criteria:
/hana/shared, and /usr/sap shouldn't be shared with data, log, or log
backup volume groups or disks.
Log backups (/hana/logbackup) should have a separate disk configured, and
they shouldn't be shared with data volume or active log volume or with HANA
binary. /hana/data and /hana/log can reside on the same volume.
Note: If production log retention is set then purge will run based on the
Retention of production db logs in hour setting under
Application Details & Settings . Size the HANA archive log backup disk to
store archives based on the production log retention setting. Note: If any of these prerequisites can't be met, then use the protection
methods for SAP HANA detailed in
Backup and DR Service for SAP HANA .
Configure the HANA userstore key
Use the following instructions to configure the HANA userstore key:
Create the database backup user from HANA Studio .
Get the instance and SQL port numbers .
Create the SAP HANA hdbuserstore key for system DB backup users .
Step 1: Create the database backup user from HANA Studio
Choose a database username based on the company's standard. Make sure to create
this user account under SYSTEMDB .
Create the user under SYSTEMDB :
From SAP HANA Studio SYSTEMDB, go to System > Security > Users > New User .
Assign a username and a password.
Set Force password change on next logon to No .
HANA 2.0 (SPS01 to SPS04): Click the System privilege tab and
assign privileges by selecting the following:
Backup admin
Catalog read
Database admin
Database start
Database stop
HANA 2.0 (SPS05 and later): Click the System privilege tab and
assign privileges by selecting the following:
Backup admin
Catalog read
Database backup operator
Database recovery operator
Database admin
Database start
Database stop
Deploy the newly created system user by clicking the green arrow .
Step 2: Get the instance and SQL port numbers
You need the HANA instance and SQL Port numbers for system DBs.
To get the instance and SQL port numbers from HANA 2.0 studio:
Go to System .
Click the Landscape tab.
Click the Services tab.
Under the Service column, navigate to the nameserver .
Get the value of SQL port. The instance number is the second and third digits
of the SQL port number.
Step 3: Create the SAP HANA hdbuserstore key for system DB backup users
Use this naming convention for the userstore key name:
For SYSTEMDB, set the key name to ( Database backup username ).
For example, for database backup username ( Actbackup ), set
SYSTEMDB-key_name- ( ACTBACKUP ) .
Procedure
Connect to the HANA database system using SSH and log into (sid)adm:
su - (sid)adm
Change directory: cd exe
Create entries in hdbuserstore using command hdbuserstore :
./hdbuserstore SET (key_name) (host name):(port) (DB_user_name) (DB_user_password)
In this example:
` ./hdbuserstore SET ACTBACKUP s4hana:30013 ACTBACKUP (DB_user_password)
Check the keystore: ./hdbuserstore list
Set up the log mode and log backup in HANA Studio
Using the HANA Studio set the HANA log mode and log backup location for Backup and DR to take backups of HANA DB transaction logs:
In SAP HANA HDB studio, make sure log backup is set correctly under DATABASE (SYSTEMDB FOR HANA 2.0) > Backup > Configuration page:
Destination type is File .
Destination is set to a local file system mount path.
Backup interval is set to required RPO .
Automatic log backup is enabled.
Database log_mode must be set to normal .
Check under Database configuration: DATABASE (SYSTEMDB FOR HANA 2.0) > Configuration page. In the filter, type basepath .
Verify that basepath_logbackup is set correctly:
Set the basepath_catalogbackup to the same as basepath_logbackup .
Open the basepath_catalogbackup edit page and set the New value
to the same as basepath_logbackup . Click Save . This ensures the
backup of the catalog with log backup for point in time recovery.
On the HANA database server, run the re-config for the values to take effect:
hdbnsutil -reconfig .
About this quickstart exercise
This exercise guides you through the steps of discovering and protecting an SAP
HANA database running in a Compute Engine instance, and finally mounting a
fully-functional new HANA database from the backup image to a new location.
Install the Backup and DR agent on the Compute Engine
Create a backup plan for the SAP HANA database
Discover and protect SAP HANA databases
Mount an SAP HANA backup image as a standard mount
Restore SAP HANA databases
Install the Backup and DR agent on the host
The Backup and DR agent connects the Compute Engine instance to the
backup/recovery appliance. To install the Backup and DR agent, see
Install the Backup and DR agent on a Linux host .
Create a backup plan for the SAP HANA databases
The backup plan is how Backup and DR Service schedules backup jobs and manages
storage for the backup images.
You created a backup plan for the Compute Engine instance in
Get started with Backup and DR: protect and recover a Compute Engine instance .
Now you must create a backup plan for the HANA database that is running inside
the Compute Engine instance. See Create and apply a policy template .
Advanced Policy Settings specific to HANA databases on Compute Engine Persistent Disks
The policy template needs these specific advanced settings.
In the appliance management console under Backup Plans , select Templates .
Select the policy template for the HANA database and click Edit .
On the right-hand side under Policies , click the white arrow beside
Snapshot , then click Edit Policy .
At the bottom of the Create/Edit Policy section, click Advanced Policy Settings .
Within the Advanced Settings dialog, find and set the following advanced
settings:
Snapshot location : Select the region where the Persistent Disk snapshots are
to be stored. By default, Multi-regional is selected (based on the source
disk location). You can also change the snapshot storage location to a
different region than the source disk region. When storing snapshots in a
location that is different from the location of your source disk, the data
travels over the network between those locations and might incur network fees.
Snapshots incur the same fees as Cloud Storage egress. Learn more about the
Persistent Disk snapshot. . To learn the pricing
details, see disk pricing .
Snapshot type : Select the Persistent Disk snapshot type to be used for SAP
HANA backups. Snapshots incrementally back up data from Persistent Disks. During
backups, a new snapshot is created to capture the current state of the
Persistent Disk. This can later be used to create a new disk for mounts or restores.
Compute Engine stores multiple copies of each snapshot across multiple
locations with automatic checksums to ensure the integrity of your data.
Learn more about the Persistent Disk snapshot .
To know the pricing details, see disk pricing. .
Standard snapshot : By default, the standard snapshot type is selected.
Use the standard type if you want to retain the backups for less than 90 days.
Archive snapshot : Select the archive type if you want to retain backup
images for a long duration. Note that the minimum billing period for the
archive snapshot is 90 days irrespective of the retention period defined in
the policy and that an archive type snapshot also has an additional
retrieval charge if it is used in a mount or a restore job.
Truncate (Purge) Log After Backup : Specify whether to truncate (purge)
the HANA archive logs after backup. When Truncate Log after Backup is
enabled, HANA archive logs are truncated. By default archive purge runs with
every database backup. Use the default to achieve best recovery RTO.
If production log retention is set, then purge runs based on the
Retention of production db logs in hours setting under Application Details & Settings .
Don't truncate/purge log after backup : This is the default. In this
mode the archive log won't be purged.
Truncate/purge log after backup : Select this option to enable archive
log purge.
Enable Database Log Backup : Set this option to "Yes". The Enable Database
Log Backup option allows the backup plan policy to backup a database and all
associated transaction log files. The logs are backed up when the log snapshot
job runs. When set to Yes, the related options are enabled.
Note: When using the Persistent Disk snapshot backup capture method, concurrent
database and log backups are not supported; they will execute sequentially
according to the backup plan.
RPO : Specify the database log backup in minutes. When Enable Database
Log Backup is set to Yes, RPO defines the frequency for database log backup.
Frequency is set in minutes and must not exceed the database backup interval.
The smallest value that can be set (in minutes) is 15.
Replicate Logs (Uses Streamsnap technology) : Set this to No .
This doesn't apply to SAP HANA Persistent Disk snapshot protection. This
function is enabled (set to "Yes") by default. Not setting it to "No" will
result in template creation error.
Send logs to OnVault Pool : Set this to No . This doesn't apply
to SAP HANA Persistent Disk snapshot protection. This function is enabled (set
to "Yes") by default. Not setting it to No will result in template creation
error.
Note: Replicate Logs (Uses Streamsnap technology) and Send logs to OnVault Pool
don't apply to SAP HANA Persistent Disk snapshot protection. These are both set
to "Yes" by default. Set them to "No". If you don't set both of these to
No , you will experience template creation errors.
Discover and protect SAP HANA databases
Note: If you are protecting a HANA database that has already been added and that
already has LVM backup images, then you must change the capture method from LVM
to Persistent Disk. To do this, remove the existing LVM template protection and then
apply a template with new Persistent Disk capture method.
To discover HANA databases on a Compute Engine instance and then protect
them with Backup and DR Service, the Compute Engine instance hosting the SAP HANA
database must be onboarded before you can onboard the SAP HANA database
application. You onboarded a Compute Engine instance in
Get started with Backup and DR: protect and recover a Compute Engine instance .
If this is the instance that hosts the SAP HANA database, then continue to the
next section.
If you must onboard a different Compute Engine instance to Backup and DR Service
see Discover and protect Compute Engine instances .
Note: For SAP HANA snapshot backups, only SSFS encryption keys are included for
backup and imported during database restoration; LSS keys are neither
backed up nor imported through this process.
Onboard the SAP HANA databases from the App Manager
Note: Successful Compute Engine onboarding provides the link to
SAP HANA onboarding wizard (step 3 below).
To discover and protect the HANA database applications:
Select Add Application from the appliance management console's App Manager > Applications page .
Select SAP HANA in the Add Application wizard .
Follow the wizard:
Select the database to manage from the Select section.
In the Manage section, apply the policy template and the resource
profile that you created in Create a backup plan for the SAP HANA databases .
Under Application Settings in the Configure section, set the
Configure backup options :
HANA DB user store key : This is the SAP HANA hdbuserstore key for
the system database created earlier. This field is mandatory.
Backup capture method : choose Use Persistent Disk Snapshot .
Retention of production DB logs in hours : At the end of every log backup,
the log purge will run and delete all the logs older than the number of hours
specified here. For example if the number of hours specified is 4 hours then
all the logs older than ((the start time of the log backup) - (4 hours)) will
be purged. The default value is 2 hours.
Retention of production catalog in days : This is the retention of
catalog metadata in days. The HANA catalog metadata (m_backup_catalog table)
will be purged of logs older than the specified number of days. For example
if the number of days specified is 14 days then data from HANA catalog will
be purged older than ((the current day) - (14 days)). The default value is
7 days.
Click Save > Next , then click Finish .
You can see the database in the App Manager Applications list with a green
shield indicating that the backup plan has been applied.
Set application details & settings
After setting the staging disk format and backup method ,
you must enter the details and settings you want to apply to your backup plans:
In the appliance management console, go to App manager and click Applications .
Right-click the HANA database and click Manage backup configuration .
At the top of the page, click Details & Settings .
In the Application details & settings window, configure database settings
based on your host type.
Backup Capture Method : persistent disk
HANA DB User Store Key : This is the SAP HANA hdbuserstore key for the
system database created earlier. This field is mandatory.
Retention of production DB logs in hours : At the end of every log backup,
the log purge will run and delete all the logs older than the number of hours
specified here. For example if the number of hours specified is 4 hours then
all the logs older than ((the start time of the log backup) - (4 hours)) will
be purged. The default value is 2 hours.
Note: Log purge retention values less than 24 hours cause the creation of
multiple temporary log backup disks during restore and mount operations
(restore, unmount-delete, or forget active mount jobs). These additional
disks are automatically managed and they are deleted once the operation is
completed.
Retention of production catalog in days : This is the retention of
catalog metadata in days. The HANA catalog metadata (m_backup_catalog table)
will be purged of logs older than the specified number of days. For example
if the number of days specified is 14 days then data from HANA catalog will
be purged older than ((the current day) - (14 days)). The default value is
7 days.
Click Save changes .
Protect HANA (HA) 1+n
HANA 1+n is always discovered as a cluster application containing all node
details in the metadata. After application discovery the application has the
cluster host as (HANA sid name)_cluster_(site id)_(HANA hardware id). For
example, if sr1 is the HANA instance, then the application name is sr1 and the
hostname is sr1_cluster<_…> in the App Manager Applications list.
It is a good idea to run a force discovery after any changes to cluster node
configuration—such as after adding or deleting a node from the cluster. If a
node is removed or added after discovery and protection, the configuration
doesn't update automatically in Backup and DR metadata, and might
cause backup issues.
Note: With the failover of the HANA database from primary to secondary, the next
database backup is a full snapshot that contains all the data on the Persistent Disk.
Subsequent database backup snapshot will contain any new data or modified data
since the first snapshot and starts a new chain. Note: If the secondary node or database is down during backup, Persistent Disk
details of the secondary node won't be saved. To perform restore using this
image, you must detach and delete data, log, and log backup disks from the
secondary node before restoring the image.
Prerequisites for protecting HANA HA (1+n)
All SAP HANA servers (Compute Engine) of the SAP HANA cluster must have
been onboarded to Backup and DR Service.
All SAP HANA servers (Compute Engine) of the SAP HANA cluster must have
the Backup and DR agent installed.
All SAP HANA servers (Compute Engine) of he SAP HANA cluster must have a
secret applied under App Manage > Manage >
Host > Backup and DR Backup and DR agent Settings
> Secret .
Ports need to be opened on the hosts to allow communication on port 5106.
This requires an ingress firewall rule where the backup/recovery appliance is
the source, the host running the Backup and DR agent is the target and the
target port is 5106. Also, there is no need to add port 5106 to the default
ingress rule created for the backup/recovery appliance, as this specifies the
backup/recovery appliance as the target.
Mount an SAP HANA backup image as a standard mount
A standard mount provides the backup image disk of data, active log and archive
log volume to the specified target. You can mount snapshot backup images of an
SAP HANA database as a standard mount for:
Any manual operation or
To Mount a backup for an integrity check
Pre checks during mount
Connector connectivity status: Verify that the Backup and DR agent is
installed and secret is applied for host connectivity between the
backup/recovery appliance and the Backup and DR agent.
Mount locations specified are available for mount operation.
HANA binary is installed
Verify that the HANA sid the same as the source isn't up and running on the
target.
The HANA instance version is greater than 2.0SP05.
Permission Check On Source and target Project for the Cloud Storage service
Mount the backup
Use these instructions to mount a backup:
Right-click the protected database from the App Manager Applications list,
and select Access .
Note: You can use the Managed Backup Plan status filter to show only
protected databases.
Select a snapshot image and choose Mount .
On the Mount page:
Project name , Region , and Zone : Select the project, region, and
Zone of the instance to which you want to mount the HANA database image.
Instance Name : Eligible Compute Engine instances (HANA nodes) will be
available to choose under the drop-down. Select the node for mount from the
drop-down.
Optionally, enter a unique name associated with the mount in the Label field.
INCLUDED TENANT DATABASES is informational only, showing the list of
tenant databases under backup image.
Under Mapping Options :
DATA Volume Mount Location : This is prepopulated with the source device
path and disk type where the HANA data volume is mounted.
Log Volume Mount Location : This is prepopulated with the source device
path and disk type where the HANA active log volume is mounted.
Log Backup Volume Mount Location : This is prepopulated with the source
device path and disk type where the HANA archive log backup volume is mounted.
DEVICE PATH : is pre-populated with the source DEVICE PATH. Provide a
path that isn't in use at the selected target and that you want to use to
mount the snapshot image of DATA VOLUME, LOG VOLUME, and LOG BACKUP VOLUME
on the target server.
Note: The hyphen special character "-" (for example: data-1) isn't
supported in the device mount location.
DISK TYPE : is pre-populated with the source DISK TYPE value. You can
change the disk type by selecting the different type from the drop-down
value.
SNAPSHOT DATA INTEGRITY CHECK : By default the value is set to true .
If you don't want to run the check, set this to false by clicking the toggle
button. This tool will run the SAP HANA persistence checking tool
hdbpersdiag API with the 'check all' option. This will verify the healthy
state of data and active log volumes from the mounted snapshot image.
If the precheck discovers any corruption in the image, then the mount job
fails with a descriptive error message.
The result of the integrity check is available under
/var/act/log/(HANA sid)_dataintegrity_check.log and
/usr/sap/(HANA sid)/HDB00/(host name)/trace/localclient.*.trc .
Click Pre-Flight check . This validates the required options on the target
server for a successful mount. If the pre-flight check fails, the pre-flight
will show which check failed so you can correct it and rerun the pre-flight.
Click Submit . You can go to the Job Monitor to view the progress and
details of the job.
Note: The integrity check is detailed in
Mount a backup for an integrity check .
Unmount the mounted backup snapshot image
To remove or keep the disk after a successful mount:
Go to Application > Access page and select the image used for mount.
On the Access page under the Current active mount drop-down, select
either:
Unmount & Delete : Choose this option to unmount the mount point,
detach the disk and delete the disk from the target server.
Forget Active Mount : Choose this option to leave the disk attached
and mounted, but remove the metadata from Backup and DR Service. You will have
to use the Google Cloud console to remove this image from the target instance
after this operation is finished.
Mount a backup for an integrity check
This tool runs the SAP HANA persistence checking tool, hdbpersdiag , with the
'check all' option to verify the healthy state of data volumes from the mounted
snapshot image. If the precheck discovers any corruption in the image, then the
mount job fails with a descriptive error message.
Clone the source database server as a new target server for data integrity check
Clone the source database server and then mount the backup to the
new target. This will have the same configuration as the source and no
additional prerequisites will be needed. This is the best practice.
Prerequisites for data integrity check mount if clone is impossible
If the source database server cannot be cloned, then make sure that these
prerequisites are set on the new target server:
The HANA binary must be configured on the target server. The HANA version must
be equal or greater than the source HANA instance.
Be sure that the target HANA configuration has the same tenant DBID configured
as source tenant database DBID.
If the source HANA database data volume and log volumes are encrypted using
HANA database encryption then you must create a config file with the encryption
key credentials on the target HANA server. Follow these steps on the target HANA
server:
Create a config file DB_DETAILS.lst under /hana/shared.
Provide read permission 400 to the config file (/hana/shared/DB_DETAILS.lst).
In the config file (/hana/shared/DB_DETAILS.lst) enter the password with
the tenant name:
HANA SID Tenant name 'password'
For example, for a HANA instance with SID "S82", DB_DETAILS.lst would contain
these lines:
S82 SYSTEMDB 'xxxxxxxx'
S82 S82 'xxxxxx'
Can I mount back to the source for integrity check?
This is not recommended. Mounting back to source while the database is running
may corrupt the data block due to the same VG name of the data volume.
If you must mount back to the source, make sure to shut down the HANA instance
at the source before performing the mount operation.
Integrity check results
The result of the integrity check is available under
/var/act/log/(HANA sid)_dataintegrity_check.log and
/usr/sap/(HANA sid)/HDB00/(host name)/trace/localclient.*.trc .
Restore SAP HANA databases
Before you can restore an SAP HANA database from a backup image, review these
license requirements.
License requirements and impact on restore
The license key for an SAP HANA database is based on the system ID and the
hardware ID. After a recovery, an SAP HANA license key becomes invalid if the
SID or hardware ID has changed.
During recovery, a temporary license key is installed automatically if the
backup used for recovery has a permanent license, which is still valid. You
can work with the automatically installed temporary license for up to 90 days.
During this time, you need to apply to SAP to have the license from the source
database transferred to a new license key. You then need to install the new
license key in the recovered SAP HANA database.
If the backup that was used for recovery only had a temporary license, the
database is in lockdown mode immediately after recovery.
Source database with temporary license These are backups taken with temporary
licenses.
Restore back to source: It is 90 days from the time of database creation
and the database is in lockdown mode.
Restore to the new target: It fails as SAP temp license doesn't allow the
restore to a new target.
Source database with permanent license These are backups taken with permanent
licenses.
Restore back to source: No issue.
Restore to the new target: It has a 90 days trial license. Backups succeed
but you can't use the new backup to restore.

Preflight check
Before submitting the restore procedure, preflight checks validate the required
prerequisites for a successful database restore.
HANA SID: HANA is configured on the target node with the same HANA SID name.
Verify Database Status: HANA Database isn't up and running.
Config file: Config file global.ini is available on target server
Log backup path: Log backup path is set under global.ini
HANA Version: Target HANA version is the same as the source HANA version.
USERSTOREKEY: Provided userstore key exists on target or a valid privileged
username and password is specified which exists at the time of backup.
For restore to a new target, verify the Mount point specified under the
mapping option isn't used or mounted at the target server.
Verify Data & Log Volume Details: If the Data & Log Volume path in the config
file (global.ini) is defined other than the chosen device path under mapping
option then the config file (global.ini) will be updated with the path chosen
under the mapping option.
Node Status:
Scale-up and standalone config: Target HANA server is up and available
HANA HA (1+n) config: Validates that replication is disabled. Replication
needs to disabled before restore can be initiated. Post restore replication
needs to be reconfigured. Restoring to any node of a HANA HA (1+n) cluster
results in creating a standalone application on the selected target host.
User has to explicitly configure the cluster back as needed and discover the
application appropriately.
Note: To be sure SAP HANA replication cluster protection works correctly,
every node in the cluster must be able to resolve the hostnames of all
other nodes in the cluster.
Restore an SAP HANA database
From the App Manager Applications list, right-click the database and
select Access .
Select the backup image to recover and choose Restore .
On the Restore page the options are:
Restore back to source : All fields are pre-populated with the source
value of protected SAP HANA instance and are immutable except application
options.
Restore to new target : All fields are pre-populated with the source
value of protected SAP HANA instance and are mutable.
Note: Before restoring an SAP HANA database to a new target server, if the
DATA, Active LOG and Log backup volumes are encrypted by HANA encryption,
then import the encryption keys from the source database server to the
target database server. Note: Restoring to a new target will present new disks for data, active
log and log backup volumes. Existing disks will remain attached to
Compute Engine instances. If not needed, the user should detach and delete
those disks.
Restoring to the source will delete the existing data, active log, and
log backup volumes. It will then create new disks from the persistent
disk snapshots and make them available to the server.
Options
Project name , Region , and Zone :
If you are restoring back to the source: All fields are pre-populated
with the source value of protected SAP HANA instance and are immutable.

when restore is performed to a new host on the same backup/recovery appliance
where the backup was originally generated.
Yes : This replaces the original application with the restored one,
which will carry the same application ID, jobhistory, backup images, and
backup plan as the original application.
No : This won't replace the original application. It will be
discovered as a new application as part of the restore job.
Application Options
Rollforward time : Choose a date and time for a database protected with
logs to recover to the required point in time.
Note: When recovering the most current backup, the rollforward control is
set to the latest point in time. For a point-in-time recovery for older
images, you must select the roll-forward time.
TARGET DATABASE SID : This is pre-populated with the protected database
SID name and is immutable.
SAP DB USER STORE-KEY : This is pre-populated with the user store key
during the backup. A new userstore key can be specified with a privileged
username and password that was available during backup. This new userstore
key will be created and will be used for recovery.
If the username and password are provided with the existing userstore
key, then the userstore key will be recreated with this username and
password. The validation will only be done after the systemdb recovers.
The tenant recovery might fail if the username or password isn't valid
or or doesn't contain the right privilege and or not available as part
of the backup image.
If a new userstore key with username and password is specified, then the
userstore key will be created with the specified userstore key name and
username and password. The validation will only be done after the
systemdb recovery. The tenant recovery might fail if the username or
password is not valid or or doesn't contain the right privilege or isn't
available as part of the backup image.
If no userstorekey, username, and password are passed, then during the
precheck, validation will occur to check if the userstorekey used during
backup exists on the target server. The precheck fails if the userstorekey
used during backup isn't found. Tenant recovery might fail if the
username or password isn't valid or or doesn't contain the right
privilege or isn't available as part of the backup image.
If no userstorekey is passed, but username and password are provided,
then the userstorekey used during backup will be recreated with the
credentials passed on the target server. The tenant recovery might fail
if the username or password isn't valid or or doesn't contain the right
privileges or isn't available as part of the backup image.
Mapping Options
DATA Volume Mount Location : This is prepopulated with the source device
path and disk type where the HANA data volume is mounted.
Log Volume Mount Location : This is prepopulated with the source device
path and disk type where the HANA active log volume is mounted.
Log backup Volume Mount Location : This is prepopulated with the source
device path and disk type where the HANA archive log backup volume is mounted.
Device Path : Immutable for restore back to source. This can be
changed during restore to a new target.
Note: The hyphen special character "-" (ex: data-1) isn't supported in
the device mount location.
Disk Type: Mutable for restore back to source. This can be changed
during restore back to source or to a new target. The disk type lets
you select the type of underlying block storage that is used for the
recovered data from the backup images.
Restore Custom HANA Configuration
The backup image captures the customer-specific configuration settings
(.ini files that have been changed from the default). You can choose to
restore custom configuration settings captured at the time of backup.
Click the pre-flight check.
If the pre-flight check fails, fix the issue and resubmit the Pre-Flight
Check.
If the pre-flight check is successful, click Submit to submit the
restore job.
