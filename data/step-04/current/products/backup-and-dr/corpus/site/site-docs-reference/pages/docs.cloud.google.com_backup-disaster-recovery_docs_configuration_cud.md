This page describes how committed use discounts work with
Backup and DR for Google Cloud VMware Engine.
For other Backup and DR CUDs, see Committed use discounts for
Backup and DR for
Oracle .
What are Committed use discounts?
Committed use discounts (CUDs) provide deeply-discounted prices in exchange
for committing to continuously use VMware Engine and
VMware Engine storage-only nodes in a particular region for a
one- or three-year term.
CUDs are ideal for workloads with predictable resource needs. You commit to a
consistent amount of usage, measured in $ per hour of equivalent on-demand
spend, for a one- or three-year term. In exchange, you receive a discounted rate
on the applicable usage your commitment covers.
Note: CUDs are applicable to both ve1 and ve1 storage-only nodes.
CUD pricing
Backup and DR for VMware Engine CUDs give you the
following discounts on on-demand pricing:
Workload
1 year in advance
1 year monthly
3 years in advance
3 years monthly
Google Cloud VMware Engine
30%
24.4%
50%
42.5%
In advance charges are invoiced in full at the start of the contract for a
one-year or a three-year commitment
Monthly charges are invoiced monthly for a one-year or a three-year
commitment
These discount percentages are the same in every region. See
Backup and DR pricing for examples
of pricing that include CUDs.
How do CUDs apply to Backup and DR for VMware Engine usage?
CUDs automatically apply to aggregate node usage in a region, giving you low,
predictable costs, without the need to make any manual changes or updates
yourself. This flexibility saves you time and helps you to save more by
achieving high utilization rates across your commitments.
Purchase commitments
To learn more about purchasing spend-based commitments, see the Google Cloud
Committed use discounts page.
You can purchase CUDs from any Cloud Billing, and the discount applies to any
eligible usage in projects paid for by that Cloud Billing. Any overage is
charged at the on-demand rate. Before you purchase a commitment, read the
Service specific terms regarding Committed Units.
Warning: Once you purchase a committed use discount, you can't cancel it.
When you purchase a Backup and DR for VMware Engine
committed use discount, you pay the same commitment fee for the entirety of the
commitment term, even if the price of applicable usage changes. You still
receive the same discount percentage on applicable usage in the event of a price
change. The commitment fee is billed monthly.
To purchase or manage CUDs for a Cloud Billing account, follow the
instructions at
Purchasing spend-based commitments .
Hourly on-demand commitment
For Hourly on-demand commitment , you need to enter the on-demand price that
matches your planned usage. To calculate the value for the field, multiply the
number of nodes with the hourly price of the protected node in the region
listed. If you additionally have an approved contractual discount, include the
discount percentage when calculating the hourly on-demand commitment.
For example, you want to purchase a commitment for three protected nodes at
$0.46 per hour, and you additionally have a contract that includes a promotional
discount of 12%, then the hourly on-demand commitment = 3 nodes * $0.46 per hour
(1 - 0.12) = $1.2144 per hour.
If you expect to spend that minimum amount per hour continuously for the next
year or more, then you can make a commitment for that amount. In other words,
when purchasing that CUD, you would enter " $1.2144 " as the hourly commitment
amount.
Before you begin
Before you can purchase a CUD, make sure you have the correct Enterprise
Discount Program (EDP) and CUD information.
Purchasing commitments for node types
You can purchase commitments for node types by using the Google Cloud console. After
purchasing a committed use discount, the commitment is effective starting within
the next hour. CUDs are automatically applied to eligible usage in the region
you specified.
To purchase a commitment for Backup and DR for
VMware Engine in your project for a specific node type, do the
following:
Note: Upfront or prepaid CUD is an allowlist GA feature. Contact
Cloud Customer Care for more information.
In the Google Cloud console, go to Billing > Commitments .
On the Committed use discounts page, click Purchase .
In the Product list, select Backup and DR (for
VMware Engine) .
In the Commitment name field, provide a name that helps you identify the
commitment that you're purchasing.
Choose a commitment duration of one or three years.
Select the region where you want to spend towards your commitment.
In the Hourly on-demand commitment field, enter the on-demand price that
matches your planned usage. For more information, see Hourly on-demand
commitment .
Review the information you provided.
Caution: Only include approved additional discounts when calculating your
hourly on-demand commitment. Inclusion of discounts that haven't been
approved can result in an increase in billed usage due to on-demand pricing.
Click the Purchase button to purchase the commitment.
Questions and challenges
Consider the following questions and answers in addition to some challenges you
might face and how to address them:
Locate discount information
You can find discount information by doing the following:
Check the contracts signed with Google Cloud.
Talk to your Google account representative.
Customers receive different kinds of discounts based on the contracts they
signed with Google Cloud. For VMware Engine, the most common
discount received is EDP.
Enterprise discount
Consider the following information about enterprise discounts:
An enterprise discount is the most common discount used by
Backup and DR (for VMware Engine) customers. This
discount is offered as part of a large Google Cloud commit.
Check for Backup and DR (for VMware Engine)
pay-as-you-go SKUs. For example, look for "VMware Protected Standard 72 VCPU
Node" SKUs where the column "Commitment - dollar based" is marked as not
applicable.
Refer to your contract or talk to your Google representative to verify.
For example, customers with 10% EDP on Backup and DR (for
VMware Engine) pay-as-you-go SKUs will receive this discount
on Backup and DR (for VMware Engine) consumption
during the contract period.
If you enter an incorrect EDP while purchasing a storage-only node, it will
impact the invoice. The following might also occur:
You might be charged for overage. For example, if the actual EDP is 0%
but you enter 10%, you might receive an overage charge every month in
addition to the CUD charges.
If you enter an EDP that's less than the actual discount, then you might
commit to spending more than what's required.
Caution: Issues related to an incorrect EDP are difficult to resolve. Always
confirm your EDP before proceeding with CUD purchase. Note: Your EDP discount is applied over and above the CUD discount.
