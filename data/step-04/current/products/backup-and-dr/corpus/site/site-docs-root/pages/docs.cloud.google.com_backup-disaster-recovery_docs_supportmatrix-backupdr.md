Backup and DR Service end-of-support-life policy
The Backup and DR End-of-Support-Life ("EOSL") Policy covers the process and
details regarding the end of support from Backup and DR for third-party systems
and software, as well as Backup and DR software and hardware.
Third-party hardware and software include hardware platforms, operating systems,
and application software protected by backup/recovery appliances. When a third-party
hardware, operating system, or application software configuration reaches EOSL
from the vendor, Backup and DR support for such configurations will
be limited to commercially reasonable assistance.
Backup and DR won't issue any more hotfixes or updates to support
software and hardware systems that are beyond the end of support life from their
respective vendors.
Supported network protocols
Backup and DR supports data movement over:
Network Block Device (NBD): This transport mode is used to back up
Google Cloud VMware Engine virtual machines.
NFS: Backup and DR Service supports NFS V3 (only) for capturing and presenting
data in following deployment configurations:
Presenting any backups to Google Cloud VMware Engine hosts using a NFS datastore
Presenting a staging disk for agent-based data capture within a
Compute Engine or Google Cloud VMware Engine VM
Supported environments for backups
The agent is supported in these environments.
Agent based backups
The Backup and DR agent can back up and recover supported
databases and file systems of supported Microsoft Windows &
Linux operating systems in the following environments.

Yes
Note: CBT on Compute Engine instances and Google Cloud VMware Engine VMs requires UEFI Secure Boot to be disabled.
Agentless backups
Backup and DR Service supports VM backups in the following environments without
needing an agent inside the VM:
Compute Engine and Cloud SQL instances (leverages Persistent Disk snapshot APIs)
SAP HANA and IBM Db2 databases that are backed up to Persistent Disk
Google Cloud VMware Engine VMs (leverages VMware vSphere Storage APIs - Data
Protection (formerly known as vStorage APIs for Data Protection or VADP))
Object storage compatibility for OnVault
OnVault supports the following Google Cloud storage:
Standard storage
Nearline storage
Coldline storage
Archive storage
Application data virtualization with the Backup and DR agent
Backup and DR agent (commonly also known as connector) is a lightweight
executable that delivers the following advanced capabilities during
the data capture and recovery processes.
Application Discovery : Backup and DR agent enables deep discovery
of databases and file systems configured on a production host
API integration : Where possible, Backup and DR agents integrate
with the application specific APIs/commands for efficient
capture of application data
Change Block Tracking : In situations where the production
applications don't have a built-in change block tracking,
Backup and DR introduces change block tracking on select platforms
Application aware recovery/mount : Backup and DR agents have built
in application awareness. The Backup and DR agent lets you
instantiate usable instances of applications during recovery mount
operations thereby eliminating the need for performing manual scripted
actions post mount.
Generic Application (LVM) Data Capture framework : Backup and DR agents
provide a generic framework to capture data from any application
running on supported Linux operating systems. This framework
provides hooks to call custom scripts to achieve application
consistent data capture and application instantiation from backup data.
Microsoft Windows Server support
The Backup and DR agent supports the following Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

1 Symantec (Veritas) Dynamic Multi Pathing (DMP) is NOT supported.
2 Supported only on Google Cloud VMware Engine VMs and not on Compute Engine instances/VMs
3 During "offline" upgrade of SuSE (upgrade from ISO), the SuSE
installer does not run a reconfigure on external packages, including the CBT
module and DLKM. As a result, when the system boots up with the updated kernel,
the dlkm is unable to load because the old configuration files still point to
the older kernel module. Upgrade of OS from ISO is not supported.
4 Backup and DR Service does not support RHEL HA.
5 Supported on both Red Hat Compatible Kernel (RHCK) and Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) versions.

IBM Db2
Backup and DR Service supports the following data capture methods:
Db2 on Linux can be captured at the volume level in an
incremental-forever fashion with instant access and virtual clone
creation for Test Data Management (TDM). This leverages Linux LVM
and Backup and DR's Changed Block Tracking capabilities and is the
recommended alternative.
For customers not using LVM or who cannot use volume level capture,
Db2 on Linux can alternatively be captured using full + incremental backup.
This uses the database's own dump-based backup.

Oracle
Backup and DR agents enable database consistent data capture of
Oracle databases. Oracle must be run in ARCHIVELOG mode. Data capture
supports capturing data to staging disks formatted as file systems or
presented as ASM disk group targets.
Oracle database protection is the same for databases running on Bare Metal Solution
servers or inside a Compute Engine instance.
Data can also be captured from Oracle Non Active Data Guard and
Active Data Guard configurations.

3 Data capture of Oracle 18c and later is at container level
(that includes all PDBs). App-aware mount on a target is at container level.
Virtual PDBs to an existing container is supported using custom scripts.
Supported data capture and data presentation methods
Backup and DR Service supports a variety of capture and presentation methods for
Oracle databases under various configurations. This includes backup,
recovery and App aware mount operations of Oracle database with
TDE (Transparent Data Encryption). For Oracle databases with TDE,
the wallet for TDE can be captured by setting the Oracle Configuration
file location advanced setting for the Oracle app. App aware mounts
for TDE enabled databases requires the wallet to be copied to the
appropriate location on the mount host.
Note: Recovery of Oracle data captured from a big-endian machine
onto a little-endian machine and the other way around are not supported.
Also note that dNFS with Oracle is supported on Linux operating systems.

PostgreSQL
Backup and DR Service supports the following data capture methods:
PostgreSQL on Linux can be captured at the volume level in an
incremental-forever fashion with instant access and virtual clone
creation for TDM. This leverages Linux LVM and Backup and DR's Changed
Block Tracking capabilities and is the recommended alternative.
For customers not using LVM or who cannot use volume level capture,
PostgreSQL on Linux can alternatively be captured using full + incremental
backup. This uses the database's "pg_dump" command, that does not support
incremental backup, so each backup will be a full database dump backup.
Due to limitations with PostgreSQL, the roll forward recovery is not
supported for full+incremental backups restore operation.

2 In this table, 'SAP HANA SavePoint API' is referring to SAP HANA
backup leveraging Backup and DR CBT and its supporting
incremental-forever and app-aware instant mount feature with log roll-forward
option. It is not referring to SAP HANA backup leveraging Persistent Disk snapshots.
When using the SAP HANA SavePoint API with Persistent Disk snapshots, scale-out HANA
configurations are not supported.
Backup and DR Service supports CBT with HANA on RHEL 7.2 and later. For a full list of CBT qualified RHEL versions, see
Linux Operating System Support .
3 SAP HANA Backint mode only supports weekly full with daily
incrementals. Supports HANA recovery using HANA HDBSQL/Backint
commands. Also App-aware instant mount capability is not supported
with HANA File-based (HDBSQL/Backint) API.
4 Supports only Backup and DR NFS disk mapping option. NFS disk
is always mapped to all HANA nodes
5 Supports both Backup and DR block and NFS disk mapping options
Note: HANA log backup is integrated with database backup policies
and is handled automatically in all of these configurations.

SAP IQ (formerly Sybase IQ)
Backup and DR Service supports capturing SAP IQ at the volume level
in an incremental-forever fashion with instant access and virtual clone
creation for TDM. This leverages Linux LVM and Backup and DR Changed Block Tracking
capabilities and is the recommended alternative.

File systems
Backup and DR agents discover each volume on a network mount point as a
protectable application. For each of these discovered applications,
Backup and DR agent orchestrates the process of achieving consistency
(through VSS/LVM snapshots), presents a staging disk which will be
formatted with a file system of the same type as source or a compatible
file system type as documented here.

Test data management with containers
Backup and DR leverages NFS volumes to make captured application
data available as NFS shares to containers.
This allows for creating virtual clones of supported databases that's
accessible from within the containerized environment.
Note: Only PostgreSQL databases on supported Linux OS are
eligible for Test Data Management with containers.
Data virtualization for virtual environments
Backup and DR supports data virtualization for virtual environments
using the following methods:
Google Cloud VMware Engine
Backup and DR Service supports capturing data from VMware virtual machines by using
VMware vSphere Storage APIs - Data Protection (formerly known as vStorage APIs
for Data Protection or VADP) calls to capture an entire virtual server.
Specifically, the API calls can:
Perform change block tracking: Makes an initial full snapshot of a database,
then afterward only snapshots the changes to the database, enabling
Backup and DR's incremental forever capture strategy.
Quiesce applications: Ensures application consistency during capture.
Note: Protection of VMware View virtual machines not supported.

Leverages VMware vSphere Storage APIs - Data Protection (formerly known as vStorage APIs for Data Protection or VADP)
1 This leverages VMware VDDK version 7.0. VDDK 8.0.3 is supported in
Backup and DR 11.0.17 and later.
2 NVME Controller types (found on ESX 7.0 and later) are
not supported. Virtual hardware version 14 and later are supported
only with ESX 7.0 (and later)
3 Capability applicable to any application with a VSS Writer
or pre and post scripts to achieve application consistent capture.
4 Since VMware vSAN does not support RDM device access
features, mounting of a VM is not supported by Backup and DR when using RDMs.
Restores and Clones of VMs are supported. However, mounting of a
VM is supported on Backup and DR when using NFS transport instead of RDM.
5 Not supported for disks presented to production VMs as pRDM.
6 Configuring SAN transport mode to backup staging disk
(agent based backups) and mounting and restoring backups using iSCSI is
not supported.
7 VMware vCenter Server 8.0 is supported on Backup and DR Service
11.0.15 and later, and 8.0.3 is supported in 11.0.17 and later.
