Apply a backup template using the appliance management console
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In the appliance management console, you protect an application by assigning
a resource profile and a template to it. This defines a backup plan to back up
the application data.
Note: This is an overview of the procedure in the appliance management console.
When you are ready to protect an application, see the specific procedure for
that application type.
To apply a backup template:
Click the App Manager tab and select the Applications option
from the drop-down list. The Applications page opens.
Select the application that you want to protect, and then
choose Manage Backup Plan from the drop-down list at the bottom right
corner of the page. The Manage Backup Plan page opens.
Choose from the Template and Profile drop-down lists:
Template. An existing backup template that includes policies
to define the snapshot or replication of the application data.
Profile. An existing resource profile that defines the
resources used to store the data of the application as
snapshot or replicated images.
The Manage Backup Plan page shows a view of the policies assigned to the
selected applications in the backup plan policy map. Data backup
comes from the template policies and profiles that you designed in the
backup plans.
Click Apply Backup Plan . The Apply Backup Plan page opens.
Configure the application's details and settings and policy overrides
settings.
Application Settings. Apply application-specific settings.
Application settings can be useful or required in certain circumstances.
Policy Overrides. Override specific policy settings previously
configured in the selected backup template.
Note: You can override policy settings only if the policy template
Allow Overrides on Policy Settings property has been set to Yes .
Click Apply backup plan to apply the backup template and resource profile.
A success message displays.
Click Okay .
If you back up a workload to a backup/recovery appliance that would exceed its
recommended storage capacity or snapshot limit, you will see a notification
with a recommendation to back up the data to a different backup/recovery appliance.
Caution: Exceeding the capacity of a backup/recovery appliance can lead to failed
jobs and unprotected data and failed restore operations.
The application might not get backed up until the scheduled job runs
according to the hours of operations defined in the backup template.
For example, if at 10:00 (UTC) you assign a template that has hours of
operation from 02:00 to 05:00 (UTC), then the first job won't start
until the appliance has an available job slot at 02:00 (UTC) of the following
day. To run a job immediately, see perform an on-demand capture .
Note: All policies start and end times are in UTC time zone.
To change backup plan settings for the application,
see Modify backup plan management of a managed application .
To disable a backup plan, see Removing backup plan management of an application .
Note: To reset one or more application settings back to its default state, click
the Reset to Default checkbox to the right of the selection you want
to reset, or click Reset All to Default to reset all application
selections back to their default state.
Disable or remove a backup plan from an application
You can disable a backup plan, temporarily suspending backup jobs, and you can
remove a backup plan from an application entirely, while keeping it available
for other applications.
To disable or remove a backup plan:
Click the App Manager tab and select the Applications option
from the drop-down list. The Applications page opens.
Select the application that you want to unprotect, and then
choose Manage Backup Plan from the drop-down list at the bottom right
corner of the page. The Manage Backup Plan page opens, showing the
template and profile that are applied to the application.
Click the drop-down at Apply . The options to Disable and
Remove Backup Plan appear.
Disabling the plan leaves it associated with the application but suspends
all backup jobs until you re-enable protection in the same way that you
disabled it ( Disable now appears as Enable for the selected
application).
Removing the plan removes it from the application but keeps it available
for other applications.
Note: To delete a template from the system completely, see Delete a backup template .
