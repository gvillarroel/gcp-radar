Monitor jobs in the appliance management console
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
From the Monitor tab, you can view and manage jobs (cancel active jobs or
change the job priority of a queued job) from backup/recovery appliances
managed by the appliance management console. You can also view events, which are
information, warning, or error notifications raised by an appliance.
You can filter jobs by name, status, start or end time, type, host, and
application.
Note: All jobs that display status as retry or failed are logged to
Cloud Logging. To display these events see
Backup and DR event logs
and to set up notification on these (or specific) events see
Configure a log-based alert .
Job status panel
The appliance management console Jobs panel provides information about jobs
that have run over the past 24 hours (default).
Current or Past Jobs. A quick view of how many jobs are running,
have succeeded, failed, were retried, or were canceled.
Job Types or Appliances. Links to the monitor filtered to show
the status of jobs by job type over the last 24 hours or by
managed backup/recovery appliance.
In the past jobs section, you can also view the status of the last week
or last month if needed. This panel fetches fresh data every two minutes.
Monitor jobs
Use these instructions to monitor jobs:
Click the Monitor tab and select Jobs from the drop-down menu to open
the Jobs page where you can see a list of all jobs that are running.
Select the Running filter to show all jobs that are being monitored.
To modify the display of the fields in the table, you can do the following:
Search By Keyword. Filter by job name, host and application
in the Jobs view or by event message in the Events view is now
auto-submit. As you type the query it will update the result set.
Search By Keyword is case insensitive.
Started, Ended and Queued . These filters have single radio style buttons
to select date range spanning a day, week for month.
Adjust Fields. Options in the top right side of the toolbar allow you to
set columns as visible or hidden and to set the number of rows to display.
Adjust Column Width. To adjust the width of a table column to
show more content in the table, drag the column divider in a
column header to the left or right to resize the column width.
Column dividers are marked by a pair of thin gray lines.
Auto-refresh. Of the Monitor grid view every fifteen seconds.
The Monitor page shows the time of the last refresh and the time until
the next refresh. You can perform a manual refresh at any time.
To export the job list as a PDF, click the export icon.
To modify the number of rows displayed in a table page, you can
select from the drop-down list at the bottom of the table.
Choices include: 10, 25, 50, 100, or 500 rows per table page.
To filter the list of jobs to view only a subset, click Open Filters
to open the filters panel. Make your filtering selections,
then click Update Filters .
Note: To clear a single filter without clearing all filters,
click the x beside the applied filter. To clear all filtering,
click Clear Filters in the filters panel.
To view the details for a specific job, select an item in the Jobs list
and then either:
Click the status link for an associated job in the Status column.
Click View Details from the bottom right corner of the page.
Note: You can also right-click on a job in the list and select
View Details from the menu.
The Job Details page opens. On this page, you can review the following:
Details about the job
Volume information
Number of job retries
Job statistics
See View job details for specifics on each of these areas.
When you are done reviewing job details, click Return to Jobs
to return to the Jobs page.
Job status
At any time a job can have one of the statuses described in the following list:
Canceled. The job was canceled by a user, or auto-canceled by the system
because the target pool exceeded the safe limit.
Failed. The job failed to run to completion within the backup plan
period. In case of job failure, an event is created with information about the
job failure. If there is time in the backup plan period, the original job
becomes retried and an identical new job is queued.
Not Run. The job couldn't run during its backup plan period due to some
constraint, for example the scheduler is disabled, destination pool is full,
source image is missing or unsuitable, connectivity issue, or there are
no available job slots.
Queued. When a policy requires a job to be run, a job is created with a
status of queued . If no constraints are present, it goes into the
running state. If constraints prevent it from running, then it remains
queued. If the constraints continue to be present until it is time to run the
next instance of the same policy, the job is given notrun status, and a new job
instance with the same job ID and a letter appended to it is added in the
queued state.
Note: While a job is queued, you can change the job priority .
Queued_Readiness. The job status only applies to Onvault and Direct to
OnVault jobs. It is displayed when a check is performed to see whether an
OnVault pool is ready for the queued job. In case there is no OnVault pool that
is available, the Queued_Readiness status is shown.
Retried. The job did not complete. The job goes into the retried state.
If there is time in the backup plan period, the original job becomes
retried and a new job instance with the same job ID and a letter appended
to it is queued. There can be 3 retry attempts, at 4, 16, and 64
minutes after each job fails. When the backup plan time runs out or if
another instance of the job begins, the original job is failed and a
retry job is started in retry status. Retry jobs have letters appended to
the job ID.
Running. The job is being processed. The job's percent
completion is indicated in the status.
Succeeded With Warnings. The job has completed successfully according to
the backup plan that invoked it, however a warning was also printed that can be
viewed in Monitor > Events . A typical example is that a Compute Engine
instance snapshot succeeded but the metadata upload to OnVault did not.
Succeeded. The job has completed successfully according to the backup plan
that invoked it.

Unmount Delete
unmount delete
Unmounts an image previously mounted to a host and discards
all changes made in that mount.
Run an on-demand job
If you require a job to start right away, run an on-demand job.
On-demand jobs include all types of restore, clone, mount jobs, and jobs
created when policies are applied on-demand.
Note: You don't need to run an on-demand job for just-discovered applications.
However, if the assigned backup plan is not scheduled to start for some time,
an on-demand job can be run immediately.
Each backup/recovery appliance reserves a pool of slots for all various categories
of jobs: data access, expiration, log replication, log OnVault, on-demand,
OnVault, snapshot, streamsnap. Also, there is an unreserved pool of slots.
Before starting a job, each backup/recovery appliance checks whether a slot
corresponding to the job's category is available to run the job. When a
reserved slot is not available because all the slots of that category are
running jobs, the backup/recovery appliance checks whether an unreserved slot is
available. If an unreserved slot is available, the job is started.
However, you can reserve the maximum number of slots that the jobs of
a particular category can use from the unreserved pool. This measure limits
the number of slots that jobs from a category can make use of from
the unreserved pool.
Note: Restore operations (mount, clone, failover, test failover, prep-mount,
and restore) use data access slots.
Run an on-demand backup job from the appliance management console
To run an on-demand capture of a managed application from the Manage Backup Plan
page:
Click the App Manager tab and select the Applications
option from the drop-down list. The Applications page opens.
Select the application or VM and then click Manage Backup Plan from
the drop-down list.
The Manage Backup Plan page opens.
Expand a template policy from the list of policies
on the right.
If a database is managed with a log protection-enabled backup template
and if backups are available, you have further log options for the
type of job to submit. In this case, you select whether to capture
the database (DB) or just the logs (Log).
Note: On-demand StreamSnap jobs can be run for DB and DB+Log types.
To perform on-demand log replication of just the database log
to a remote backup/recovery appliance, select the Replicate Logs menu
command described in Running On-Demand Database Log Replication .
Click Run Now and a confirmation message opens.
Click Yes to confirm. A point-in-time image is created per
the backup policy.
Run on-demand database log replication
In some cases, you might need to manually initiate log replication to the
remote backup/recovery appliance for a database image. For example, you might need
to manually perform log replication if the log for a database image did not
properly replicate to the backup/recovery appliance or if there is no log for the
database image on the backup/recovery appliance. You can then use the transaction logs
at the remote appliance to recover a database to a specified
point-in-time.
Note: Manually replicated transaction logs won't be visible on the
remote appliance until the Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server
database image is replicated to the remote appliance.
The recover range is only visible when the replicated database
image appears on the remote appliance.
To manually initiate database logs replication to the remote
backup/recovery appliance:
Click the App Manager tab and select the Applications option
from the drop-down list. The Applications page opens.
Select the managed application or VM and then click Replicate Logs
from the drop-down list at the bottom right corner of the page.
Click Confirm in the confirmation dialog that opens. The database
transaction logs are replicated to the remote appliance defined by the
replication policy in the template.
Monitor mount jobs to containers
To monitor a mount job to a container:
Click the Monitor tab and select Jobs from the drop-down
menu to open the Jobs page where you can see a list of all
jobs that are running.
Filter by Mount jobs.
Identify the job you want to monitor by its Label or other details.
If the job is running, you can monitor its progress. Once completed,
select the job and click View Details to review:
Details about the job
Volume information
Number of job retries
Job statistics
See Viewing Job Details
for specifics on each of these areas.
Access container YAML code
The section Container YAML lists the YAML code snippet that was
added to the container or pod's YAML configuration file. You can refer
back to this code and use it at a later point of time as needed.
When you are done reviewing job details, click Return to Jobs
to return to the Jobs page.
Cancel a running job
You can cancel jobs that are running or are queued to run.
To cancel an active job:
Click the Monitor tab and select Jobs from the drop-down menu.
The Jobs page opens listing all jobs that are running. You can clear
this default filter to show all jobs that are being monitored.
Select the job that you want to cancel, then click Cancel Job from
the bottom right corner of the window.
Note: You can also right-click on a job in the list and select
Cancel Job from the menu.
Click Confirm in the Cancel Job dialog.
Change job priority
You can change the priority of an in-process job based on how you want
the backup/recovery appliance to allocate necessary resources.
To change the priority of a queued job:
Click the Monitor tab and select Jobs from the drop-down menu.
The Jobs page opens listing all jobs that are running. You can clear
this default filter to show all jobs that are being monitored.
Select the job that you want to change priority from the Jobs page and
then click View Details and then Change Priority from the bottom
right corner of the window.
Note: You can also right-click on a job in the list and select
Change Priority from the menu.
From the Set Job Priority dialog, select the job priority.
Click Confirm to change priority selection.
How uncompleted jobs are retried before failing
When a scheduled job fails, the scheduler will automatically retry the job up
to three more times. The first time a job fails, the status of the first
attempt will be marked as Retried and the scheduler will wait four minutes before
queuing the job again. If it fails a second time, the next retry will be
queued after 16 minutes. If it fails a third time, a final retry will be
queued after a holdoff period of 64 minutes. After three failed retry attempts
(for a total of four attempts), the final retry job will be marked as Failed
(rather than Retried ) and no further jobs are attempted for that application
in that schedule period.
The scheduler will treat a job retry like any other available job. If there
are more jobs queued than slots to accommodate them, then the queued retry job
will need to wait for a slot. If the policy window closes before a retry
job can start, then any queued retry jobs won't run and no further retries
will be attempted.
Job retries are reported in Monitor > Jobs . To identify job retries
all four jobs will have the same job number in the following format in this
order:
Job_xxxxx (Status: Retried)
Job_xxxxxa (Status: Retried; queued after a 4 minute holdoff)
Job_xxxxxb (Status: Retried; queued after a 16 minute holdoff)
Job_xxxxxc (Status: Failed; queued after a 64 minute holdoff)
The next time a backup job for this application is attempted depends on the
policy's schedule. So if the schedule calls for one snapshot
per day in a window starting at 01:00, the next attempt will be the
following day at 01:00.
Timezone
By default, in the appliance management console, all time stamps shown in the jobs and events menus
are in the user's local timezone as detected by the web browser. If you want to
confirm which timezone is in use, on the dashboard menu bar, select the user
icon in the top right hand corner. It displays both the auto-detected timezone
as well as set the timezone if the detected timezone is not suitable.
Use the following instructions to change the timezone.
On the dashboard, click the user icon that is on the top right corner.
Select Change Timezone .
From the Timezone drop-down, select the timezone to use when displaying
jobs and events.
Click Save .
About scheduled jobs
Jobs run according to the schedule assigned in their backup template policies.
If you try to run many resource-intensive jobs simultaneously, then some have to
wait for the resources to come available. If the wait is too long, the window
closes and a backup plan violation occurs.
It is better to stagger resource-intensive jobs like initial snapshot jobs over
time rather than to have them all compete for resources at the same moment.
For example, instead of snapping all VMs, file systems, and databases at 6:00 PM
on weekdays, consider snapping one type of application on the hour, another type
at 10 minutes after the hour, and another type at 20 minutes after the hour.
The initial snapshot of an application or a VM is the largest and most
time-consuming snapshot because every bit of data is new.
When you add a new large application or VM, perform an on-demand snapshot at an
off-peak time for the first snapshot and then schedule a backup template policy
for all future snaps.
About on-demand jobs
Most jobs run on a schedule according to their backup plans, but
for upcoming maintenance windows, software upgrades, and for the first snapshot
of a new application, you want to ensure that you have a successful copy of
the data created before you start your scheduled maintenance task. These cases
call for an on-demand job.
About job slots
Backup and DR Service manages jobs by assigning job slots . The appliance reserves a
pool of slots for each category of jobs, plus a pool of unreserved slots.
Before starting a job, Backup and DR checks whether a slot corresponding to the
job's category is available to run the job. When a reserved slot is not
available because all the slots of that category are running jobs, the appliance
checks whether an unreserved slot is available. If an unreserved slot is
available, the job is started.
Queue of on-demand backup jobs
Backup and DR Service supports queuing of on-demand jobs to provide the flexibility
to create your images without concern for the number of on-demand job slots
available to start the job. The queued on-demand job remains in the queued
state until an on-demand job slot is available.
When an on-demand slot opens, the job progresses to the running state.
This sequence occurs in the order that the job was submitted. If an on-demand
job fails, the appliance will attempt to run the next job in the queue.
On-demand jobs use different job slots than scheduled jobs, so scheduled jobs
may run before queued jobs.
While an on-demand job is in a queued state you can change the job priority ,
cancel the job or cancel protection for the application. You can view the queued
jobs by clicking Monitor then Jobs .
A canceled on-demand job appears in the job history table as a canceled job.
The start time of the job and the end time of the job will be the time that the
cancel request or the cancellation of application protection was acknowledged.
Maintain performance when adding new applications
If your system has been performing acceptably and then you add new applications,
performance might suffer for a short time. This is because change block tracking
recognizes new data and protects it even when it is only a small part of a large
application. This means the system is optimized to process many changed blocks
every day.
A new application requires a lot more resources for the initial capture, because
it is all new data to the system.
Use the following information for best results when adding new applications:
When you add a new application, protect it for the first time using an
on-demand job during a period of light load. This prevents the
resource-intensive initial ingest job from interfering with other jobs.
When adding multiple new applications or VMs, try to stagger the initial
protection jobs for each new application over time, to prevent all of the
new data from being ingested simultaneously. Do this by assigning backup
plans that run at different times. You can also use the on-ramp job slots
feature to minimize disruption.
Separate the initial protection job in time from the mirror job. Once an
application snapshot has been taken, the mirror job can run some hours
later when the system load is lighter.
Consistency groups can be an efficient way to protect multiple
applications with similar needs; see
Capture application data in Backup and DR consistency groups .
Be aware of your existing backup plans and try not to schedule snapshot
jobs simultaneously with the snapshot jobs for very large or dynamic
applications.
You can choose from the list of preserved snapshot images from the
Manage tab, and:
Select from the list of preserved images and navigate to that image in
the App Manager .
Expire one or more selected snapshot images.
Note: When expiring snapshots, the amount of space reclaimed might be
less than the amount of space consumed by that snapshot. This is due
to the common block reference between snapshots. To ensure maximum
space reclamation, expire the oldest snapshot first.
