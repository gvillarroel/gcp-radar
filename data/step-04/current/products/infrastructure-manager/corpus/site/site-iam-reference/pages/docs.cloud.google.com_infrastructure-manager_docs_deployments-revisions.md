Deployments, revisions, and previews overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes deployments and revisions, including the following:
List of metadata stored for each deployment.
The format of the deployment name and revision name.
Deployments
Infra Manager provisions resources onto Google Cloud as a deployment.
A deployment can provision Google Cloud resources to multiple locations and
to multiple projects. Note that:
The specific resources need to be available in the locations. For example,
see Cloud Run locations for the list of
locations where Cloud Run is available.
The service account must have the permissions that are required to
deploy to the specified projects. For details, see
Configure the service account .
Deployment metadata
Infra Manager creates a storage bucket in the project and location
where Infra Manager is run. After the deployment is created, the
Infrastructure Manager artifacts are in this storage bucket which has the name:
gs:// PROJECT_NUMBER - LOCATION -blueprint-config .
Infra Manager uses the term blueprint to refer to a
Terraform configuration.
Where you replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID where Infra Manager is run.
LOCATION : the location where Infra Manager is run.
The deployment artifacts in the storage bucket include:
Cloud Build logs.
Terraform logs.
A copy of the Terraform configuration.
Infra Manager also stores a copy of the Terraform state file. For
details about the state file, including accessing the file, see
Manage the Terraform state file .
Revisions are versions of a deployment, so Infra Manager stores
this deployment metadata for each revision.
Deployment name
The format of the deployment name is:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /deployments/ DEPLOYMENT_ID
Where:
PROJECT_ID is the project ID where Infra Manager runs.
LOCATION is the location where Infra Manager runs. See
Infrastructure Manager locations for
the list of valid locations.
DEPLOYMENT_ID is the deployment identifier, and is a
user-specified name. This name must:
Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens.
Start with a lowercase letter.
End with a number or lowercase letter
Cannot be the string archived-deployments or archived-previews
Must be unique within the project and location where
Infra Manager is run.
For example:
projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/deployments/my-deployment
Revisions
Revisions are versions of a deployment. When you initially create a
deployment, this deployment is also a revisions and has the revision ID r-0 .
Revision name
When you create an Infra Manager deployment, it is automatically given the
revision identifier r-0 . If you update the deployment, then Infrastructure Manager
creates a new revision with identifier r-1 . For every new revision,
the identifier increases by one. The revision identifier can only be set
by Infrastructure Manager.
For example, a revision name could be:
projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/deployments/my-deployment/revisions/r-1
Previews
A preview describes the actions to actuate a specific Terraform configuration.
Before you create a new deployment or update a deployment, you can preview
the deployment to verify the resources that are planned to be provisioned.
Preview metadata
Infra Manager creates a storage bucket in the project and location
where Infra Manager is run. After the preview is created, the Infra Manager artifacts are in this storage bucket which has the name:
gs:// PROJECT_NUMBER - LOCATION -blueprint-config .
For a preview of a new deployment, the metadata is organized with a
new-previews prefix, for example:
gs:// PROJECT_NUMBER - LOCATION -blueprint-config/new-previews/preview-name
You can also preview an update to an existing deployment. For these previews
targeting an existing deployment, the artifacts are stored in the same storage
bucket as the deployment artifacts. The storage bucket which has the name:
gs:// PROJECT_ID - LOCATION -blueprint-config/deployment-ID/previews/preview-ID .
Infra Manager uses the term blueprint to refer to a Terraform configuration.
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : : the project ID where Infra Manager is run.
LOCATION : : the location where Infra Manager is run.
The preview artifacts in the storage bucket include:
Cloud Build logs.
Terraform logs.
A copy of the Terraform configuration.
Preview name
The format of the preview name is:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /previews/ PREVIEW_ID
Where:
PROJECT_ID is the project ID where Infra Manager runs.
LOCATION is the location where Infra Manager runs. See
Infrastructure Manager locations for
the list of valid locations.
PREVIEW_ID is the deployment identifier, and is a
user-specified name. This name must:
Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens.
Start with a lowercase letter.
End with a number or lowercase letter
Cannot be the string archived-deployments or archived-previews
Must be unique within the project and location where
Infra Manager is run.
For example:
projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/previews/my-preview
