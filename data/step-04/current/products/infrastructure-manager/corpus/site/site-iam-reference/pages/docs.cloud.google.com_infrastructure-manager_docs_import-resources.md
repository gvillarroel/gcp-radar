Import deployed resources into Infrastructure Manager
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial demonstrates how to import Google Cloud resources into a
Infrastructure Manager deployment. You can only import resources that were
provisioned using Terraform.
If you have a Terraform configuration and have not yet deployed it on
Google Cloud, then see
deploy infrastructure using Infrastructure Manager .
This tutorial begins with deploying a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) onto
Google Cloud using the Terraform CLI. Then, this tutorial demonstrates how
to import these deployed resources into Infrastructure Manager so that the resources
can be managed as an Infrastructure Manager deployment.
You can use the example in this tutorial to understand how to import other
Google Cloud resources into Infra Manager. To import the
deployment into Infra Manager, the Terraform configuration used to
provision the resources does need to comply with the
constraints , and the
resources need to have been provisioned using a
supported Terraform version .
Costs
This tutorial uses the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Infrastructure Manager
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Before you begin
Note: If you're using this tutorial to understand how to import other deployments
into Infra Manager, ensure that the Terraform configuration you used
to provision the resources the complies with the
constraints , and that
the resources were provisioned using a
supported Terraform version .
Sign in to your Google Account. If you don't already have one,
sign up for a new account .
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Infrastructure Manager API:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable config.googleapis.com
Set up authentication:
Ensure that you have the Create Service Accounts IAM role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator ) and the Project IAM Admin role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin ). Learn how to grant roles .
Create the service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with a name for the service account.
Grant the roles/config.agent IAM
role to the service account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role = roles/config.agent
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : the name of the service account
PROJECT_ID : the project ID where you created the service account
Note : The --role flag affects which resources the service account can access in your
project. You can revoke these roles or grant additional roles later.

project. You can revoke these roles or grant additional roles later.
Install a supported version of Terraform .
Deploy resources to Google Cloud
The Google Cloud resource that you deploy in this tutorial is a
VPC. This section shows you how to deploy the resource to use
as an example for importing deployed resources into Infra Manager.
This tutorial uses the us-central1 region. If you want to use another region,
then you can use any of the location where Infra Manager runs. See
Infrastructure Manager locations
for the list of valid locations.
Grant permissions for resources in the configuration
You have granted permissions needed to run Infra Manager, but you
also need to grant permissions that are specific to the resources described
in the configuration you are deploying.
Grant permissions to be able to create the VPC network, which is
the resource defined in the Terraform configuration:
gcloud projects add - iam - policy - binding PROJECT_ID \
--member=serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role=roles/compute.networkAdmin
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : the name of the service account.
PROJECT_ID : your project ID.
Deploy resources using the Terraform CLI
Create a VPC network using the following Terraform
configuration. To do so, run the following command:
mkdir vpc_to_import
cd vpc_to_import
cat << EOF > main . tf
variable "project_id" {
type = string
}
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
name = "my-custom-mode-network"
project = var . project_id
}
EOF
Deploy the configuration using the Terraform CLI using the following command:
terraform init
echo "************** TERRAFORM APPLY ******************"
terraform apply - var = "project_id= PROJECT_ID " - auto - approve
cd ..
When the VPC is provisioned, you see output that begins with
the text Creation complete .
The VPC that is defined in the Terraform configuration is now
deployed on Google Cloud. Terraform creats a state file, and this file is
on the file system next to the main.tf file.
Create a placeholder deployment in Infrastructure Manager
To import resources into Infra Manager, you need an existing
deployment in Infra Manager.
This tutorial uses a storage bucket to store the Terraform configuration. If
you are using this tutorial to understand how to import other deployments
into Infra Manager, then you can store the Terraform
configuration in a storage bucket, public Git repository, or on your
local machine.
Add an empty Terraform configuration to the storage bucket:
gcloud storage buckets create gs://import-deployment-configuration --project= PROJECT_ID
mkdir placeholder_deployment
cd placeholder_deployment
cat <<EOF > main.tf
EOF
gcloud storage cp main.tf gs://import-deployment-configuration
cd ..
Create a deployment using Infra Manager.
gcloud infra-manager deployments apply projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/deployments/import-deployment \
--gcs-source gs://import-deployment-configuration \
--input-values project_id= PROJECT_ID \
--service-account projects/ PROJECT_ID /serviceAccounts/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT
When the deployment is done, you see:
Creating the deployment...done
You now have an Infra Manager deployment. Next, you need to add the
state file and Terraform configuration to this deployment so that this
deployment manages the VPC.
Import the state file and Terraform configuration
To manage the deployed resource (the VPC) using
Infra Manager, you need to add the
state file and the Terraform configuration to Infra Manager.
Lock the deployment
Lock the Infra Manager deployment so you can make changes to its
state.
LOCK_ID=$(gcloud infra-manager deployments lock projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/deployments/import-deployment --format="get(lockId)")
Import the Terraform state file into Infra Manager
Import the state file for your deployed resources. This state file was created
by Terraform when you deployed the VPC using the Terraform CLI.
Upload the Terraform state file to the Infra Manager deployment.
SIGNED_STATE_UPLOAD_URL =$ ( gcloud infra - manager deployments import - statefile projects / PROJECT_ID / locations / us - central1 / deployments / import - deployment -- lock - id $ { LOCK_ID } -- format = "get(signedUri)" )
cd vpc_to_import
curl - s - X PUT -- upload - file terraform . tfstate $ SIGNED_STATE_UPLOAD_URL
Upload the Terraform configuration to the Cloud Storage bucket
Now that you have uploaded the Terraform state file, you also need to upload the
Terraform configuration that you used to create the VPC network.
Infra Manager needs the Terraform state file so that when a
Infra Manager preview is run, it doesn't find any changes to
the resources.
Upload the Terraform configuration to Cloud Storage using the following
command:
gcloud storage cp main.tf gs://import-deployment-configuration
Unlock the deployment
If you are using this tutorial to understand how to import any
resources into Infra Manager, ensure that the state file and
Terraform configuration don't have differences. If there are differences
between the state file and the Terraform configuration, then ensure that the
state file describes the resources that you want deployed. When you unlock the
deployment, if there are differences between the state file and Terraform
configuration, then when you unlock the deployment Infra Manager
creates or deletes resources to match the state file.
Caution: Deleting Google Cloud resources can cause unrecoverable data
loss. Re-deploying the configuration won't restore data.
You need to unlock the deployment to be able to manage the resources using
Infra Manager. In this tutorial, the state file and Terraform
configuration describe the same configuration, and so Infra Manager
doesn't create or delete any resources.
Release the lock from the deployment by running the following.
gcloud infra-manager deployments unlock projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/deployments/import-deployment \
--project PROJECT_ID \
--location us-central1 \
--lock-id ${ LOCK_ID }
Now that the state file and Terraform configuration are added to your
Infra Manager deployment, you have finished importing the deployed
resources. The deployed VPC is now managed by
Infra Manager.
Preview resource changes
Run a preview on the deployment to confirm that the Terraform
state and the resources deployed on Google Cloud are in sync.
Create a preview using the following command:
gcloud infra - manager previews create projects / PROJECT_ID / locations / us - central1 / previews / IMPORT_DEPLOYMENT_PREVIEW_NAME \
--gcs-source gs://import-deployment-configuration \
--deployment projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/deployments/import-deployment \
--service-account projects/ PROJECT_ID /serviceAccounts/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID . iam.gserviceaccount.com
--location us-central1
Get preview details to make sure it has finished successfully.
gcloud infra-manager previews describe projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/previews/ IMPORT_DEPLOYMENT_PREVIEW_NAME
Export the preview to review changes.
SIGNED_BIN_PLAN_URL =$ ( gcloud infra - manager previews export projects / PROJECT_ID / locations / us - central1 / previews / IMPORT_DEPLOYMENT_PREVIEW_NAME -- format "get(result.binarySignedUri)" )
curl - X GET -- output tfplan . out $ SIGNED_BIN_PLAN_URL
Ensure the configuration is present locally and initialized with the
following command:
terraform init
Run Terraform show to review changes between Infrastructure Manager deployment
state and the configuration.
terraform show tfplan.out
If the VPC resource on Google Cloud and the state file are in
sync, then terraform show outputs the following validating that
Infrastructure Manager does not see any changes between deployment state and the
configuration. You see an output similar to the following:
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
You have now imported the deployed resources so that they are managed by
Infra Manager. For example, you can now use Infra Manager to
update the deployment .
You can also update the deployment
to validate that the deployment was successfully imported
into Infra Manager.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete individual resources
Delete the VPC and the metadata about the deployment:
gcloud infra-manager deployments delete projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/deployments/quickstart-deployment
