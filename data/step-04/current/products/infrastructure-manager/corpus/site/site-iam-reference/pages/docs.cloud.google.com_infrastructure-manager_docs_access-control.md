Access control with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes Infrastructure Manager roles and permissions.
Infra Manager uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control
access to the service. To grant access to deploy resources with
Infra Manager, assign the needed Infra Manager
IAM roles
to the service account
that you use to call Infra Manager. For details about how to grant
permissions to service accounts, see
Manage access to service accounts .
A service account is not required to view Infra Manager deployments,
revisions, and IAM policies. To view Infra Manager, grant access
to the user, group, or service account.
To deploy or view the Google Cloud resources defined in the Terraform
configuration, you need to grant the service account permissions that are
specific to these resources. These permissions are in addition to the
Infra Manager permissions listed on this page. For a list of all
roles and the permissions they contain, see
Identity and Access Management basic and predefined roles reference .
Predefined Infra Manager roles
IAM provides
predefined roles that grant
access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevent unauthorized access
to other resources.
The following table lists the Infra Manager IAM roles and
the permissions that they include:

Infra Manager Service Account ( roles/cloudconfig.serviceAgent )
When you enable the Infra Manager API, the Infra Manager service account is automatically created in the project and is granted this role for the resources in the project. The Infra Manager service account uses this role only as required to perform actions when creating, managing, or deleting deployments and revisions.

In addition to the Infra Manager predefined roles, the
basic Viewer and Owner roles also
include permissions related to Infra Manager.
However, we recommend that you grant predefined roles where possible to comply with the
security principle of least privilege .
The following table lists the basic roles and the Infra Manager
IAM roles
that they include.
Role
Includes role
Viewer
roles/config.viewer
Owner
roles/config.admin
Permissions
Permissions that the caller must have to call each method is listed in the
REST API reference .
