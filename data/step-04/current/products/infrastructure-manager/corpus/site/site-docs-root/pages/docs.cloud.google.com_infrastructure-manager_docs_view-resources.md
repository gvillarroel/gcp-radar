This page describes how to view information about resources that are
provisioned by Infrastructure Manager.
You may want to view resources to understand their state, or to see what
resources exist in a deployment before you update or delete the deployment.
When Infrastructure Manager deploys a Terraform configuration, the service provisions
and configures the Google Cloud resources that are defined in the
configuration. Metadata about these resources are in the Terraform state file,
and Infra Manager stores this file for each deployment and revision.
The state file has information about the resources when they are provisioned
by Infra Manager. The state file and Infra Manager do not
have information about these resources if they are modified, unless they
are modified by a
Infra Manager revision .
For example, you can use Infra Manager to deploy a load balancer
and then you can modify the load balancer using the Google Cloud console.
In this case, Infra Manager has information about the load balancer
that was initially provisioned, but not about the changes that you did
through the Google Cloud console.
If you need information about the deployment name or state, see
View deployments .
Before you begin
Ensure Infra Manager is enabled .
Ensure you have a service account.
Ensure that you have the IAM permissions needed to view deployments.
roles/config.admin or roles/config.viewer .
List resources provisioned by a deployment
To list the resources provisioned by a deployment:
gcloud infra-manager resources list --revision=projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /deployments/ DEPLOYMENT_ID /revisions/ REVISION_ID
Replace:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID where Infrastructure Manager runs.
LOCATION : the location where Infra Manager
runs. See Infrastructure Manager locations
for the list of valid locations.
DEPLOYMENT_ID : the deployment identifier of the resource's
deployment.
REVISION_ID : the revision identifier of the revision
you're viewing.
Filter the list of resources
To filter the list of resources:
gcloud infra-manager resources list --revision=projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /deployments/ DEPLOYMENT_ID /revisions/ REVISION_ID --filter= EXPRESSION
Replace:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID where Infrastructure Manager runs.
LOCATION : the location where Infra Manager
runs. See Infrastructure Manager locations
for the list of valid locations.
DEPLOYMENT_ID : the deployment identifier of the resource's
deployment.
REVISION_ID : the revision identifier of the revision
you're viewing and filtering.
EXPRESSION : the expression you are filtering for. Supported
expressions are:
terraformInfo.address (string)
terraformInfo.type (string)
terraformInfo.id (string)
state (string) , one of: STATE_UNSPECIFIED , PLANNED , IN_PROGRESS , RECONCILED , FAILED
intent(string) , one of: INTENT_UNSPECIFIED , CREATE , UPDATE , DELETE , RECREATE , UNCHANGED
caiAssets.fullResourceName (map)
caiAssets.type (map)
Sort the list of resources
To sort the list of resources:
gcloud infra - manager resources list --revision=projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /deployments/ DEPLOYMENT_ID /revisions/ REVISION_ID --sort-by=[ FIELD ]
Replace:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID where Infrastructure Manager runs.
LOCATION : the location where Infra Manager
runs. See Infrastructure Manager locations
for the list of valid locations.
DEPLOYMENT_ID : the deployment identifier of the resource's
deployment.
REVISION_ID : the revision identifier of the revision
you're viewing and sorting.
FIELD : the field used to sort. Supported fields are:
name
terraformInfo.address
terraformInfo.type
terraformInfo.id
View details about a resource
To view details about a specific resource, use the resource ID:
gcloud infra-manager resources describe projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /deployments/ DEPLOYMENT_ID /revisions/ REVISION_ID /resources/ RESOURCE_ID
Replace:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID where Infrastructure Manager runs.
LOCATION : the location where Infra Manager
runs. See Infrastructure Manager locations
for the list of valid locations.
DEPLOYMENT_ID : the deployment identifier of the resource's
deployment.
REVISION_ID : the revision identifier of the specific revision
that deployed the resource.
RESOURCE_ID : the resource ID of the resource you're viewing.
