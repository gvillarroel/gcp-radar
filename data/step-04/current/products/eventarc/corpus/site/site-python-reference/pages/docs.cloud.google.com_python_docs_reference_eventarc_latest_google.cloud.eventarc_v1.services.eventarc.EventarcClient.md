Return the API endpoint used by the client instance.
Returns
Type
Description
str
The API endpoint used by the client instance.
transport
Returns the transport used by the client instance.
Returns
Type
Description

Methods
EventarcClient
EventarcClient (
* ,
credentials : typing . Optional [ google . auth . credentials . Credentials ] = None ,
transport : typing . Optional [
typing . Union [
str ,
google . cloud . eventarc_v1 . services . eventarc . transports . base . EventarcTransport ,
typing . Callable [
[ ... ],
google . cloud . eventarc_v1 . services . eventarc . transports . base . EventarcTransport ,

] = None ,
client_options : typing . Optional [

] = None ,
client_info : google . api_core . gapic_v1 . client_info . ClientInfo = google . api_core . gapic_v1 . client_info . ClientInfo
)
Instantiates the eventarc client.
Parameters
Name
Description
credentials
Optional[google.auth.credentials.Credentials]
The authorization credentials to attach to requests. These credentials identify the application to the service; if none are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the credentials from the environment.
transport
Optional[Union[str,EventarcTransport,Callable[..., EventarcTransport]]]
The transport to use, or a Callable that constructs and returns a new transport. If a Callable is given, it will be called with the same set of initialization arguments as used in the EventarcTransport constructor. If set to None, a transport is chosen automatically.
client_options
Optional[Union[google.api_core.client_options.ClientOptions, dict]]
Custom options for the client. 1. The api_endpoint property can be used to override the default endpoint provided by the client when transport is not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and transport was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment variable, which have one of the following values: "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is the default value). 2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable is "true", then the client_cert_source property can be used to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not set, no client certificate will be used. 3. The universe_domain property can be used to override the default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that the api_endpoint property still takes precedence; and universe_domain is currently not supported for mTLS.
client_info
google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo
The client info used to send a user-agent string along with API requests. If None , then default info will be used. Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing your own client library.
Exceptions
Type
Description
google.auth.exceptions.MutualTLSChannelError
If mutual TLS transport creation failed for any reason.
__exit__
__exit__ ( type , value , traceback )
Releases underlying transport's resources.
Warning:
ONLY use as a context manager if the transport is NOT shared
with other clients! Exiting the with block will CLOSE the transport
and may cause errors in other clients!

.policy_pb2.Policy
Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources. A Policy is a collection of bindings . A binding binds one or more members to a single role . Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions (defined by IAM or configured by users). A binding can optionally specify a condition , which is a logic expression that further constrains the role binding based on attributes about the request and/or target resource. **JSON Example** :: { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": ["user:eve@example.com"], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01t00:00:00.000z')",="" }="" }="" ]="" }="" **yaml="" example**="" ::="" bindings:="" -="" members:="" -="" user:mike@example.com="" -="" group:admins@example.com="" -="" domain:google.com="" -="" serviceaccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com="" role:="" roles/resourcemanager.organizationadmin="" -="" members:="" -="" user:eve@example.com="" role:="" roles/resourcemanager.organizationviewer="" condition:="" title:="" expirable="" access="" description:="" does="" not="" grant="" access="" after="" sep="" 2020="" expression:="" request.time="">< timestamp('2020-10-01t00:00:00.000z')="" for="" a="" description="" of="" iam="" and="" its="" features,="" see="" the=""> IAM developer's guide __.
