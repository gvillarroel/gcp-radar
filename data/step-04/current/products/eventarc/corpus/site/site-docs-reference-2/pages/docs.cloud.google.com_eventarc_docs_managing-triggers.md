Manage triggers
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Standard
You can manage triggers using either the Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI
in either your terminal or
Cloud Shell . You can
also manage triggers through the Eventarc API.
List triggers
You can list, filter, and sort through your triggers in all locations.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Eventarc
Triggers page.
Go to Triggers
This lists all the triggers in your project for all locations, and
includes details such as the trigger name, region, event provider,
destination, and event type.
To filter your triggers by a specific property:
Click the filter_list Filter
box.
From the list of Properties , select an option to filter the
triggers by—for example, Name or Event channel .
You can select a single property or use the logical operator
OR to add more properties to filter by.
To sort your triggers, click arrow_upward
Sort beside the appropriate column heading.
Only some columns are sortable—for example, Name , Region , or
Event channel .
gcloud
gcloud eventarc triggers list --location = -
This command lists your trigger name, type, destination, and status in all
locations.
REST
To list triggers in a given project and location, use the
projects.locations.triggers.list
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud
project ID.
LOCATION : the
region in which the triggers are created—for
example, us-central1 .
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://eventarc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /triggers"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://eventarc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /triggers" | Select-Object -Expand Content
If successful, the response body contains instances of
Trigger
and the response should be similar to the following:
{
"triggers": [
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /triggers/ TRIGGER_NAME ",

not delivering events .
Update a trigger
You can update a trigger for Cloud Run, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE),
and Workflows destinations. Depending on the destination, specific
fields can be updated.
Important: If you update a trigger before its
generated event is delivered,
the event is routed according to the previous filtering and delivered to the original
destination within three days of the event generation. The new filtering is applied to events
generated after your update.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Eventarc
Triggers page.
Go to Triggers
From the list of triggers, click the trigger you want to know the details
about.
On the Trigger details page, click edit
Edit .
Edit fields as required and click Save .
Note that you can't update any unavailable fields such as the
Event provider and Event destination . For more information about
the fields, see the Console instructions for a
specific provider, event type,
and destination .
gcloud
Cloud Run
gcloud eventarc triggers update TRIGGER \
--location = LOCATION \
--event-filters = NEW_EVENT_FILTERS \
--service-account = NEW_SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
--destination-run-region = NEW_REGION \
--destination-run-service = NEW_SERVICE \
--destination-run-path = NEW_PATH \
--event-data-content-type = " NEW_EVENT_DATA_TYPE "
Replace the following:
TRIGGER : the ID of the trigger or a fully
qualified identifier.
LOCATION : the location of the
Eventarc trigger.
You can update any of the following:
NEW_EVENT_FILTERS : the filter used to
configure the event routing of the trigger; for example,
methodName=storage.objects.create can be updated to
methodName=storage.objects.delete . Note that after a trigger is
created, the type event filter can't be changed. For a different event
type, you must create a new trigger.
NEW_SERVICE_ACCOUNT : the Identity and Access Management
(IAM) service account email associated with the trigger.
NEW_REGION : the region in which the
destination Cloud Run service can be found.
NEW_SERVICE : the name of the
Cloud Run service that receives the events for the
trigger.
NEW_PATH : the relative path on the destination
Cloud Run service to which the events for the trigger
should be sent.
NEW_EVENT_DATA_TYPE : the encoding of the event
payload; depending on the event provider, this can be
application/json or application/protobuf .
For example, to update the service account for a trigger:
gcloud eventarc triggers update my-cloud-run-trigger \
--service-account = new-serviceaccount@ ${ PROJECT_ID } .iam.gserviceaccount.com
This command updates the service account of a trigger named
my-cloud-run-trigger to
new-serviceaccount@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com .
GKE
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Note that this section also applies to the public endpoints of private and
public services running in a GKE cluster.
gcloud eventarc triggers update TRIGGER \
--location = LOCATION \
--destination-gke-namespace = NEW_NAMESPACE \
--destination-gke-service = NEW_SERVICE \
--destination-gke-path = NEW_PATH \
--event-data-content-type = " NEW_EVENT_DATA_TYPE "
Replace the following:
TRIGGER : the ID of the trigger or a fully
qualified identifier.
LOCATION : the location of the Eventarc
trigger.
You can update any of the following:
NEW_NAMESPACE : the namespace in which the
destination GKE service is running.
NEW_SERVICE : the name of the GKE
service that receives the events for the trigger.
NEW_PATH : the relative path on the destination
GKE service to which the events for the trigger should be
sent.
NEW_EVENT_DATA_TYPE : the encoding of the event
payload; depending on the event provider, this can be
application/json or application/protobuf .
For example, to update the event receiver service for a trigger:
gcloud eventarc triggers update my-gke-trigger \
--destination-gke-service = helloworld-events
This command updates the event receiver service for a trigger named
my-gke-trigger to a GKE service named
helloworld-events .
Workflows
gcloud eventarc triggers update TRIGGER \
--location = LOCATION \
--event-filters = NEW_EVENT_FILTERS \
--service-account = NEW_SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
--destination-workflow = NEW_DESTINATION_WORKFLOW \
--destination-workflow-location = NEW_DESTINATION_WORKFLOW_LOCATION \
--event-data-content-type = " NEW_EVENT_DATA_TYPE "
Replace the following:
TRIGGER : the ID of the trigger or a fully
qualified identifier.
LOCATION : the location of the Eventarc
trigger.
You can update any of the following:
NEW_EVENT_FILTERS : the filter used to configure
the event routing of the trigger; for example,
methodName=storage.objects.create can be updated to
methodName=storage.objects.delete . Note that after a trigger is created,
the type event filter can't be changed. For a different event type, you
must create a new trigger.
NEW_SERVICE_ACCOUNT : the Identity and Access Management
(IAM) service account email associated with the trigger.
NEW_DESTINATION_WORKFLOW : the ID of the
deployed workflow that receives the events from the trigger.
NEW_DESTINATION_WORKFLOW_LOCATION : the location
in which the destination workflow is deployed.
NEW_EVENT_DATA_TYPE : the encoding of the event
payload; depending on the event provider, this can be
application/json or application/protobuf .
For example, to update the service account for a trigger:
gcloud eventarc triggers update my-workflows-trigger \
--service-account = new-serviceaccount@ ${ PROJECT_ID } .iam.gserviceaccount.com
This command updates the service account of a trigger named
my-workflows-trigger to
new-serviceaccount@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com .
REST
To update an existing trigger, use the
projects.locations.triggers.patch

or
{"destination": {"cloudRun": {"service": "hello-world", "region": "us-central1"}}}
EVENT_FILTER : optional. The event
attributes to filter on. Only updating the method type for Cloud Audit Logs triggers is supported.
For example: {"eventFilters": [{"attribute": "methodName", "value": "storage.buckets.create"},
{"attribute": "type", "value": "google.cloud.audit.log.v1.written"},
{"attribute": "serviceName", "value": "storage.googleapis.com"}]}
Note that you
can't update method types for GKE destinations.
CONTENT_TYPE : optional. The encoding
of the event payload; depending on the event provider, this can be application/json
or application/protobuf .
UPDATE_FIELDS : optional. A
comma-separated list of fields to be updated. If not provided, all provided fields in the
request are updated. For example: serviceAccount,destination
Request JSON body:
{
"serviceAccount": " SERVICE_ACCOUNT @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com",
