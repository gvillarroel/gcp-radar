Use customer-managed encryption keys
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Standard
By default, Eventarc encrypts customer content at
rest. Eventarc handles encryption for you without any
additional actions on your part. This option is called Google default encryption .
If you want to control your encryption keys, then you can use customer-managed encryption keys
(CMEKs) in Cloud KMS with CMEK-integrated services including
Eventarc. Using Cloud KMS keys gives you control over their protection
level, location, rotation schedule, usage and access permissions, and cryptographic boundaries.
Using Cloud KMS also lets
you view audit logs and control key lifecycles.
Instead of Google owning and managing the symmetric
key encryption keys (KEKs) that protect your data, you control and
manage these keys in Cloud KMS.
After you set up your resources with CMEKs, the experience of accessing your
Eventarc resources is similar to using Google default encryption.
For more information about your encryption
options, see Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) .
Customer-managed encryption keys are
stored as software keys, in a Cloud HSM cluster , or
externally using Cloud External Key Manager .
Cloud KMS produces audit logs when keys are enabled, disabled, or
used by Eventarc Advanced resources to encrypt and decrypt messages.
For more information, see the
Cloud KMS audit logging information .
What is protected with CMEK
Note: Enabling a channel with CMEK protects the Pub/Sub topic used as a
transport layer by Eventarc Standard. However, the CMEK key is
not displayed through the Google Cloud console. You can use the Google Cloud CLI to
verify that a CMEK key is enabled for a Pub/Sub topic .
You can configure CMEK for a channel that Eventarc Standard uses
and encrypt the events that pass through the channel. Enabling a channel with
CMEK protects the data associated with it by using an encryption key that only
you can access.
When you enable CMEK for the Google channel in a Google Cloud project, all
Eventarc Standard triggers for Google event types in that project
and region are fully encrypted with that CMEK key. CMEK keys can't be applied
on a per-trigger basis.
Before you begin
Before using this feature in Eventarc, you should:
Console
Enable the Cloud KMS and Eventarc APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
Create a key ring .
Create a key for a specified key ring .
gcloud
Update gcloud components.
gcloud components update
Enable the Cloud KMS and Eventarc APIs for
the project that will store your
encryption keys.
gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com eventarc.googleapis.com
Create a key ring .
Create a key for a specified key ring .
For information on all flags and possible values, run the command with the
--help flag.
Terraform
Enable the Cloud KMS and Eventarc APIs for the
project that will store your encryption keys by configuring the
google_project_service
resource:
# Enable Cloud KMS API
resource "google_project_service" "cloudkms" {
service = "cloudkms.googleapis.com"
disable_on_destroy = false
}
# Enable Eventarc API
resource "google_project_service" "eventarc" {
service = "eventarc.googleapis.com"
disable_on_destroy = false
}
Create a key ring and key by configuring the
google_kms_key_ring
and google_kms_crypto_key
resources:
resource "random_id" "default" {
byte_length = 8
}
# Create a Cloud KMS key ring
resource "google_kms_key_ring" "default" {
name = "${random_id.default.hex}-example-keyring"
location = "us-central1"
}
# Create a Cloud KMS key
resource "google_kms_crypto_key" "default" {
name = "example-key"
key_ring = google_kms_key_ring.default.id
rotation_period = "7776000s"
}
For more information about using Terraform, see the
Terraform on Google Cloud documentation.
Note that Cloud KMS and Eventarc are
regionalized services. The region for the Cloud KMS key and the
protected Eventarc channel must be the same.
Grant the Eventarc service account access to a key
To grant the Eventarc service account access to the
Cloud KMS key, add the service account as a principal of the key,
and grant the service account the
Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter role:
Console
When you enable CMEK for a Google or third-party channel through the
console, you are prompted to grant the
Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter role to the service account.
For more information, in this document,
see Enable CMEK for Google event types or
Enable CMEK for a third-party event channel .
gcloud
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding KEY_NAME \
--keyring RING_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--member serviceAccount: SERVICE_AGENT_EMAIL \
--role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
Replace the following:
KEY_NAME : the name of the key. For example, my-key .
RING_NAME : the name of the key ring. For example,
my-keyring .
LOCATION : the location of the key. For example,
us-central1 .
SERVICE_AGENT_EMAIL : the email address of the
service account with the eventarc.serviceAgent role.
For example,
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-eventarc.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
For more information, see Service agents .
Terraform
Generate the service identity for the Eventarc service by
configuring the
google_project_service_identity
resource:
resource "google_project_service_identity" "eventarc_sa" {
provider = google-beta
project = data.google_project.default.project_id
service = "eventarc.googleapis.com"
}
Grant the Cloud KMS role to the Eventarc service
account by configuring the
google_kms_crypto_key_iam_member
resource:
# Grant service account access to Cloud KMS key
resource "google_kms_crypto_key_iam_member" "default" {
crypto_key_id = google_kms_crypto_key.default.id
role = "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter"
member = "serviceAccount:${google_project_service_identity.eventarc_sa.email}"
}
Enable CMEK for Google event types
Eventarc triggers that
route Google event types
publish events to a virtual channel referred to as a Google channel that is
project and regional-specific. This virtual channel is available in all
Eventarc regions.
When you enable CMEK for the Google channel in a Google Cloud project,
all Eventarc triggers for Google event types in that project
and region are fully encrypted with that CMEK key. You can add multiple CMEK
keys, and associate each with a specific region for the Google channel. CMEK
keys can't be applied on a per-trigger basis.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Eventarc >
Channels page.
Go to Channels
Click a channel with a Google Provider .
In the Edit channel page, select the Use a customer-managed
encryption key (CMEK) checkbox.
Click Add encryption key .
Select a Region and, in the CMEK encryption key list, select a
key ring that you have created for the region. Note that you can add only
one encryption key per region for a channel.
Optional: To manually enter the resource name of the key, in the CMEK
encryption key list, click Don't see your key? Enter key resource name ,
and enter the key name in the specified format.
If prompted, grant the cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter role to the
Eventarc service account with the eventarc.serviceAgent
role.
Optional: Click Add encryption key to add another key ring that you
have created for a different region.
Click Save .
gcloud
gcloud eventarc google-channels update \
--location = LOCATION \
--crypto-key = KEY
Replace the following:
LOCATION : the
region of the Google channel to be
protected. It must match the location of the key used. Note that you can add
only one encryption key per region for a channel.
KEY : the fully qualified Cloud KMS key name
in the format projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/ KEY_NAME .
Terraform
Enable CMEK for the GoogleChannelConfig resource in a given project and
location by configuring the
google_eventarc_google_channel_config
resource:
# Specify a CMEK key for the `GoogleChannelConfig` resource
resource "google_eventarc_google_channel_config" "default" {
location = "us-central1"
name = "googleChannelConfig"
crypto_key_name = google_kms_crypto_key.default.id
depends_on = [ google_kms_crypto_key_iam_member.default ]
}
REST

Apply a CMEK organization policy
Eventarc is integrated with two
organization policy constraints
to help ensure CMEK usage across an organization:
constraints/gcp.restrictNonCmekServices is used to require CMEK protection.
constraints/gcp.restrictCmekCryptoKeyProjects is used to limit which
Cloud KMS keys are used for CMEK protection.
Note: CMEK organization policies only apply to newly created resources within
supported Google Cloud services. For more information, see
Google Cloud resource hierarchy
and CMEK organization policies .
This integration lets you specify the following encryption compliance
requirements for Eventarc resources in your organization:
Require CMEKs for new Eventarc resources
Restrict Cloud KMS keys for an Eventarc project
Considerations when applying organization policies
Before applying any CMEK organization policies, you should be aware of the
following.
Prepare for a propagation delay
After you set or update an organization policy, it can take up to 15 minutes
for the new policy to take effect.
Consider existing resources
Existing resources are not subject to newly created organization policies.
For example, an organization policy does not retroactively apply to existing
pipelines. Those resources are still accessible without a CMEK and, if
applicable, are still encrypted with existing keys.
Verify required permissions to set an organization policy
The permission to set or update the organization policy might be difficult to
acquire for testing purposes. You must be granted the
Organization Policy Administrator role ,
which can only be granted at the organization level (rather than the project or
folder level).
Although the role must be granted at the organization level, it is still
possible to specify a policy that only applies to a specific project
or folder.
Require CMEKs for new Eventarc resources
You can use the constraints/gcp.restrictNonCmekServices constraint to require
that CMEKs be used to protect new Eventarc resources in an
organization.
If set, this organization policy causes all resource creation requests without a
specified Cloud KMS key to fail.
After you set this policy, it applies only to new resources in the project. Any
existing resources without Cloud KMS keys applied continue to exist
and are accessible without issue.
Important: Before setting this policy, make sure to enable CMEK for the Google
channel in a Google Cloud project so that all Eventarc
triggers for Google event types in that project and region are fully encrypted
with that CMEK key. In this document, see
Enable CMEK for Google event types .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Organization policies page.
Go to Organization policies
Using the Filter , search for the following constraint:
constraints/gcp.restrictNonCmekServices
In the Name column, click Restrict which services may create resources
without CMEK .
Click edit Manage Policy .
On the Edit policy page, under Policy source , select
Override parent's policy .
Under Rules , click Add a rule .
In the Policy values list, select Custom .
In the Policy type list, select Deny .
In the Custom values field, enter the following:
is:eventarc.googleapis.com
Click Done , and then click Set policy .
gcloud
Create a temporary file /tmp/policy.yaml to store the policy:
name : projects/ PROJECT_ID /policies/gcp.restrictNonCmekServices
spec :
rules :
- values :
deniedValues :
- is:eventarc.googleapis.com
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project
where you are applying this constraint.
Run the
org-policies set-policy
command:
gcloud org-policies set-policy /tmp/policy.yaml
To verify that the policy is successfully applied, you can try to create an
Eventarc Standard channel in the project. The process fails
unless you specify a Cloud KMS key.
Restrict Cloud KMS keys for an Eventarc project
You can use the constraints/gcp.restrictCmekCryptoKeyProjects constraint to
restrict the Cloud KMS keys that you can use to protect a resource in
an Eventarc project.
For example, you can specify a rule similar to the following: "For applicable
Eventarc resources in projects/my-company-data-project ,
Cloud KMS keys used in this project must come from
projects/my-company-central-keys OR projects/team-specific-keys ."
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Organization policies page.
Go to Organization policies
Using the Filter , search for the following constraint:
constraints/gcp.restrictCmekCryptoKeyProjects
In the Name column, click Restrict which projects may supply KMS
CryptoKeys for CMEK .
Click edit Manage Policy .
On the Edit policy page, under Policy source , select
Override parent's policy .
Under Rules , click Add a rule .
In the Policy values list, select Custom .
In the Policy type list, select Allow .
In the Custom values field, enter the following:
under:projects/ KMS_PROJECT_ID
Replace KMS_PROJECT_ID with the ID of the
project where the Cloud KMS keys you want to use are
located.
For example, under:projects/my-kms-project .
Click Done , and then click Set policy .
gcloud
Create a temporary file /tmp/policy.yaml to store the policy:
name : projects/ PROJECT_ID /policies/gcp.restrictCmekCryptoKeyProjects
spec :
rules :
- values :
allowedValues :
- under:projects/ KMS_PROJECT_ID
Replace the following
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where you
are applying this constraint.
KMS_PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where
the Cloud KMS keys you want to use are located.
Run the
org-policies set-policy
command:
gcloud org-policies set-policy /tmp/policy.yaml
To verify that the policy is successfully applied, you can try to create an
Eventarc Standard channel using a Cloud KMS key from a
different project. The process will fail.
Disabling and enabling Cloud KMS keys
A key version stores the cryptographic key material that you use to encrypt,
decrypt, sign, and verify data. You can disable this key version so that data
that was encrypted with the key can't be accessed.
When Eventarc cannot access Cloud KMS keys,
event publishing with channels fails with FAILED_PRECONDITION errors and event
delivery stops. You can enable a key in the Disabled state so that the
encrypted data can be accessed again.
Disable Cloud KMS keys
To prevent Eventarc from using the key to encrypt or decrypt
your event data, do any of the following:
We recommend
disabling the key version
you have configured for the channel. This affects only the
Eventarc channels and triggers that are associated with the
specific key.
Optional: Revoke the cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter role
from the Eventarc service account. This affects all the
project's Eventarc channels and triggers that support events
encrypted using CMEK.
Although neither operation guarantees instantaneous access revocation,
Identity and Access Management (IAM) changes generally propagate faster. For more
information, see
Cloud KMS resource consistency and
Access change propagation .
Re-enable Cloud KMS keys
To resume event delivery and publishing,
restore access
to Cloud KMS.
Pricing
This integration does not incur additional
costs beyond the key operations, which are billed to your Google Cloud
project. The use of CMEK for a channel incurs charges for access to the
Cloud KMS service based on Pub/Sub pricing .
For more information on the most current pricing information, see
Cloud KMS Pricing .
