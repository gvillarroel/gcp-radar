Advanced
Standard
Eventarc is available in specific regions depending on whether you
are using Eventarc Advanced or Eventarc Standard.
A region is a specific geographic place, such as São Paulo.
A multi-region is a large geographic area, such as the United States, that
contains two or more geographic places. (Some sources support dual-regions
which are a specific pair of regions, such as Tokyo and Osaka.)
For more information about regions and zones, see
Geography and regions .
Eventarc Advanced
Eventarc Advanced is available in the following regions:

Eventarc Standard
The location for an Eventarc trigger should be either global
(applicable to some events only) or one of the supported regions
depending on the event type.
For more information, see
Understand Eventarc locations .
Cloud Audit Logs events
Triggers for Cloud Audit Logs events are available in single-region
locations and you can create a global Eventarc trigger;
however, triggers are not supported in dual-region and multi-region locations.
When specifying the global location for Cloud Audit Logs triggers, you will
receive events from all locations for which the event filters match. For
example, by creating a global Eventarc trigger, you can
receive events from resources in the EU and US multi-regions.
Pub/Sub messages
Triggers for Pub/Sub messages are only available in
single-region locations and you can't create a global Eventarc
trigger.
Direct events
Triggers for events that are sent directly from one of the following Google
sources are available in specific locations. For all other sources, see the
supported regions .

Cloud Speech-to-Text
You must create a global Eventarc trigger for Cloud
Speech-to-Text events.
Cloud Storage
Triggers for Cloud Storage events are available in single-region,
dual-region, and multi-region locations; you can't create a global
Eventarc trigger.
Important: Because Eventarc Standard uses Pub/Sub as its transport layer,
Cloud Storage triggers can fail if a Cloud Storage event originates from a region not
permitted by your Pub/Sub message storage policy, and if in-transit operations are
enforced ( "enforceInTransit": true ). When you create a Cloud Storage
trigger in a multi-region location, ensure your message storage policy allows all source regions
within that multi-region. For more information, see
Configure message storage policies .
Note that the Cloud Storage bucket must reside in the same
Google Cloud project and region as the Eventarc
trigger.
In addition to the single-region locations listed in the
Supported regions section, the following
locations are also supported for Cloud Storage triggers:
asia : Data centers in Asia
asia1 : ASIA-NORTHEAST1 and ASIA-NORTHEAST2
eu : Data centers within member states of the European Union
eur4 : EUROPE-NORTH1 and EUROPE-WEST4
nam4 : US-CENTRAL1 and US-EAST1
us : Data centers in the United States

Cloud Storage triggers can fail if a Cloud Storage event originates from a region not
permitted by your Pub/Sub message storage policy, and if in-transit operations are
enforced ( "enforceInTransit": true ). When you create a Cloud Storage
