— Eventarc for GKE destinations
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
An Eventarc trigger declares your interest in a certain event or set
of events. You can configure event routing by specifying filters for the trigger,
including the event source, and the target Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) service
running in a GKE cluster. Note that targets can only include
services running in (public or private) GKE clusters with
public endpoints. To target services in GKE clusters with
private endpoints, route events to
internal HTTP endpoints .
Eventarc delivers events to the event receiver in a
CloudEvents format through an HTTP request.
These instructions show you how to configure event routing to your
GKE service that is triggered by a direct
AlloyDB for PostgreSQL event. For more details, see the list of
supported direct events .
Note: If both direct and audit log events are supported for a Google provider,
we recommend that you create a trigger that filters for the direct event. Direct
events offer a number of advantages over audit log events. For more information,
see Event routes .
Before you begin
You must enable Workload Identity Federation for GKE on the GKE cluster
and node pool that the destination service is running on.
Workload Identity Federation for GKE is required to properly set up the event forwarder and
is the recommended way to access Google Cloud services from applications
running within GKE due to its improved security properties and
manageability.
Workload Identity Federation for GKE
Applications running on GKE might need access to
Google Cloud APIs. Workload Identity Federation for GKE allows a Kubernetes service account
in your GKE cluster to act as an IAM service
account . Pods that use the configured Kubernetes
service account automatically authenticate as the IAM service
account when accessing Google Cloud APIs. Using Workload Identity Federation for GKE
lets you assign distinct, fine-grained identities and authorization for
each application in your cluster. Note that specific permissions must be granted
to the Eventarc trigger's service account. In this document,
see the steps to Create a service account .
For more information on enabling and configuring Workload Identity Federation for GKE on
your GKE clusters, refer to
Use Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
Event forwarder
Eventarc's event forwarder pulls new events from
Eventarc and forwards them to the GKE
destination. This component acts as a mediator between the Pub/Sub
transport layer and the GKE service. It works on existing
services and also supports signaling services (including those not exposed
outside of the fully-managed cluster) while simplifying setup and maintenance.
At a networking level, to receive events in a GKE service, you
don't need to open the service to external traffic as all events are delivered
from an origin that resides within the same GKE cluster.
Note that the event forwarder's lifecycle is managed by Eventarc,
and if you accidentally delete the event forwarder, Eventarc
will restore this component.
For each trigger pointing to a GKE destination, the event
forwarder (a specifically configured gke-forwarder pod) does the following:
It uses the Pub/Sub API to open a
StreamingPull connection
to the trigger transporter (a Pub/Sub topic and subscription)
and receives events as they become available.
It transforms events to the correct
CloudEvents format and encodes and delivers them
as an HTTP POST request to the target GKE service.
The Eventarc service agent needs the permission to run and
regularly update the gke-forwarder instance. This permission must be granted
once per project. For details, in this document, see
Enable GKE destinations .
Troubleshooting
To resolve issues that you might encounter when using Eventarc for
GKE, see
Troubleshoot Eventarc for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) .
Prepare to create a trigger
For each trigger that targets a GKE service,
Eventarc creates an event forwarder component. Eventarc
requires permissions to install the component and manage resources in the
GKE cluster. Before creating an Eventarc
trigger for GKE destinations, ensure that you
complete the following tasks.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or
create a Google Cloud project .
Note: If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this
procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After
you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources
associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Enable the Eventarc, Eventarc Publishing,
Google Kubernetes Engine, and Resource Manager APIs.
Enable the APIs
If applicable, enable the API related to the direct events. For example,
for AlloyDB for PostgreSQL events, enable the
AlloyDB for PostgreSQL API.
If you don't already have one, create a user-managed service account,
then grant it the roles and permissions necessary so that
Eventarc can manage events for your target service.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create service account
page.
Go to Create service account
Select your project.
In the Service account name field, enter a name. The Google Cloud console
fills in the Service account ID field based on this name.
In the Service account description field, enter a description. For
example, Service account for event trigger .
Click Create and continue .
To provide appropriate access, in the Select a role list, select
the required Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to grant to your service
account. For more information, see
Roles and permissions for GKE targets .
For additional roles, click add
Add another role and add each additional role.
Click Continue .
To finish creating the account, click Done .
gcloud
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Enable the Eventarc, Eventarc Publishing,
Google Kubernetes Engine, and Resource Manager APIs.
gcloud services enable eventarc.googleapis.com \
eventarcpublishing.googleapis.com \
container.googleapis.com \
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
If applicable, enable the API related to the direct events. For example,
for AlloyDB for PostgreSQL events, enable
alloydb.googleapis.com .
If you don't already have one, create a user-managed service account,
then grant it the roles and permissions necessary so that
Eventarc can manage events for your target GKE
destination.
Create the service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with the name of the service account.
It must be between 6 and 30 characters, and can contain lowercase
alphanumeric characters and dashes. After you create a service account, you
cannot change its name.
Grant the required Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles or permissions.
For more information, see
Roles and permissions for GKE targets .
Enable GKE destinations
To allow Eventarc to manage resources in the GKE
cluster, enable GKE destinations, and bind the
Eventarc service agent with the required roles.
Enable GKE destinations for Eventarc:
gcloud eventarc gke-destinations init
At the prompt to bind the required roles, enter y .
The following roles are bound:
roles/compute.viewer
roles/container.developer
roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin
Create a trigger
You can create an Eventarc trigger using the Google Cloud CLI
or through the Google Cloud console.
Note: Filtering is done through an exact match and does not support
wildcards or regular expressions. However, you can use the
--event-filters-path-pattern flag in the following
gcloud CLI command, or define a path pattern through the console.
For more information, see
Understand path patterns .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Eventarc
Triggers page.
Go to Triggers
Click add_box
Create trigger .
Type a Trigger name .
This is the ID of the trigger and it must start with a letter. It can
contain up to 63 lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens.
For the Trigger type , select
Google sources .
In the Event provider list, select
AlloyDB for PostgreSQL .
Note that the event provider name used in the associated
Google Cloud documentation might not have a prefix
of Cloud or Google Cloud . For example, on the console,
Memorystore for Redis is referred to as
Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis .
In the Event type list, from the Direct events,
select an event type.
To specify the encoding of the event payload, in the Event data
content type list, select application/json or
application/protobuf .
Note that an event payload formatted in JSON is larger than one formatted
in Protobuf. This might impact reliability depending on your event
destination and its limits on event size. For more information, see
Known issues .
In the Region list, select the same region as the
Google Cloud service that is generating events.
For more information, see
Eventarc locations .
If applicable to the event provider, click Add filter
and specify the following:
In the Attribute 1 field, depending on the direct
event you chose, select a resource ID
that can act as an event filter.
Select an operator:
Equal
Path pattern
For more information, see
Understand path patterns .
In the Attribute value 1 field, depending on the
operator that you chose, type the exact value or apply a path pattern.
If more attribute filters are applicable, click
Add filter and specify the appropriate values.
Select the Service account that will invoke your service
or workflow.
Or, you can create a new service account.
This specifies the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service account email
associated with the trigger and to which you previously granted
specific roles required
by Eventarc.
In the Event destination list, select
Kubernetes Engine .
Select a service.
This is the name of the service that receives the events for the trigger.
The service must be in the same project as the trigger and will receive
events as HTTP POST requests sent to its root URL path ( / ),
whenever the event is generated.
Optionally, you can specify the Service URL path to send
the incoming request to.
This is the relative path on the destination service to which the events
for the trigger should be sent. For example: / , /route ,
route , route/subroute .
Optionally, to add a label, you can click
add
Add label . Labels are key-value pairs that help you organize your
Google Cloud resources. For more information, see
What are labels?
Click Create .
After a trigger is created, the event source filters cannot be modified.
Instead, create a new trigger and delete the old one. For more information,
see Manage triggers .
gcloud
You can create a trigger by running a gcloud eventarc triggers create
command along with required and optional flags.
gcloud eventarc triggers create TRIGGER \
--location = LOCATION \
--destination-gke-cluster = DESTINATION_GKE_CLUSTER \
--destination-gke-location = DESTINATION_GKE_LOCATION \
--destination-gke-namespace = DESTINATION_GKE_NAMESPACE \
--destination-gke-service = DESTINATION_GKE_SERVICE \
--destination-gke-path = DESTINATION_GKE_PATH \
--event-filters = "type= EVENT_FILTER_TYPE " \
--event-filters = " COLLECTION_ID = RESOURCE_ID " \
--event-filters-path-pattern = " COLLECTION_ID = PATH_PATTERN " \
--event-data-content-type = " EVENT_DATA_CONTENT_TYPE " \
--service-account = SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com "
Replace the following:
TRIGGER : the ID of the trigger or a fully qualified
identifier
LOCATION : the location of the Eventarc
trigger. Alternatively, you can set the eventarc/location
property; for example, gcloud config set eventarc/location us-central1 .
To avoid any performance and data residency issues, the location must
match the location of the Google Cloud service that is generating events.
For more information, see
Eventarc locations .
DESTINATION_GKE_CLUSTER : the name of the
GKE cluster in which the target
GKE service that receives events is running.
DESTINATION_GKE_LOCATION : (optional) the
Compute Engine region
of the GKE cluster in which the destination GKE
service is running. If not specified, it is assumed that the cluster is a
regional cluster and is in the same region as the trigger.
DESTINATION_GKE_NAMESPACE : (optional) the
namespace in which the destination GKE service is running.
If not specified, the default namespace is used.
DESTINATION_GKE_SERVICE : the name of the
GKE service that receives the events
for the trigger. The service can be in any of the GKE-supported
locations and does not need to be in the same location as the
trigger. However, the service must be in the same project as the trigger
and will receive events as HTTP POST requests sent to its root URL path
( / ), whenever the event is generated.
DESTINATION_GKE_PATH : (optional) the relative path
you specify on the destination GKE service to which the
events for the trigger should be sent. For example: / ,
/route , route , route/subroute .
EVENT_FILTER_TYPE : the identifier of the event.
An event is generated when an API call for the method succeeds.
For long-running operations, the event is only generated at the end of
the operation, and only if the action is performed successfully.
For a list of supported event types, see
Google event types supported by Eventarc .
COLLECTION_ID (optional): the
resource component that can act as
an event filter, and is one of the following:
cluster
instance
backup
RESOURCE_ID : the identifier of the resource
used as the filtering value for the associated collection. For more
information, see
Resource ID .
PATH_PATTERN : the
path pattern to apply when
filtering for the resource.
EVENT_DATA_CONTENT_TYPE : (optional) the
encoding of the event payload .
This can be application/json or
application/protobuf . The default encoding is
application/json .
Note that an event payload formatted in JSON is larger than one formatted
in Protobuf. This might impact reliability depending on your event
destination and its limits on event size. For more information, see
Known issues .
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : the name of your user-managed service
account.
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
Notes:
The --event-filters="type= EVENT_FILTER_TYPE "
flag is required. If no other event filter is set, events for all
resources are matched.
EVENT_FILTER_TYPE cannot be changed after
creation. To change EVENT_FILTER_TYPE , create a
new trigger and delete the old one.
Each trigger can have multiple event filters, comma delimited in one
--event-filters =[ ATTRIBUTE = VALUE ,...]
flag, or you can repeat the flag to add more filters. Only
events that match all the filters are sent to the destination. Wildcards
and regular expressions are not supported; however, when using the
--event-filters-path-pattern flag, you can define a resource
path pattern .
The --service-account flag is used to specify the Identity and Access Management
(IAM) service account email associated with the trigger.
Example:
gcloud eventarc triggers create helloworld-trigger \
--location=us-central1 \
--destination-gke-cluster=gke-events-cluster \
--destination-gke-location=us-central1-a \
--destination-gke-namespace=default \
--destination-gke-service=helloworld-events \
--destination-gke-path=/ \
--event-filters="type=google.cloud.alloydb.cluster.v1.updated" \
--event-filters-path-pattern="cluster=my-cluster-*" \
--service-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
This command creates a trigger called helloworld-trigger for
the event identified as google.cloud.alloydb.cluster.v1.updated and
matches events for cluster IDs
starting with my-cluster- .
Terraform
You can create a trigger for a GKE destination using Terraform.
For details, see
Create a trigger using Terraform .
Note: Although your trigger is created immediately, it can take up to two
minutes for a trigger to propagate and filter events.
List a trigger
You can confirm the creation of a trigger by listing Eventarc
triggers using the Google Cloud CLI or through the Google Cloud console.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Eventarc
Triggers page.
Go to Triggers
This page lists your triggers in all locations, and includes details such
as names, regions, event providers, destinations, and more.
To filter your triggers:
Click filter_list Filter
or the Filter triggers field.
In the Properties list, select an option to filter the triggers by.
You can select a single property or use the logical operator OR to add
more properties.
To sort your triggers, beside any supported column heading, click
arrow_upward Sort .
gcloud
Run the following command to list your triggers:
gcloud eventarc triggers list --location = -
This command lists your triggers in all locations, and includes details such
as names, types, destinations, and statuses.
