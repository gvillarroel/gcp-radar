This document shows you how to grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and
permissions to support routing events using Eventarc from
Google Cloud and other sources to GKE destinations, including
the public endpoints of private and public services running in a
GKE cluster.
Note: If you want to attach a service account in one project to an Eventarc
trigger in another project, you must first complete the steps outlined in
Support a cross-project service account .
Grant project-wide permissions to the principal invoking the Eventarc APIs
(for example, the Eventarc trigger creator):
The Eventarc Admin role allows you full control over
all Eventarc resources, including specifying a service
account for the trigger when you create it.
The Service Account User role allows a principal to impersonate and use
a service account. The service account is associated with an
Eventarc trigger and represents the identity of the trigger.
Grant Eventarc trigger permissions to the trigger service account :
The Eventarc Event Receiver role allows your
Eventarc trigger to receive events from event providers. You
don't need to grant the role if you are routing direct events from Cloud
Pub/Sub.
The Pub/Sub Subscriber role allows your
Eventarc trigger to consume messages from
Pub/Sub and to attach subscriptions to a topic.
The Monitoring Metric Writer role allows Eventarc's
event forwarder to write metrics using Cloud Monitoring and other systems
that provide metrics.
Grant permissions to Google service agents :
If you are creating a trigger for direct events from Cloud Storage, grant
the Pub/Sub Publisher role.
If you enabled the Cloud Pub/Sub service agent on or before
April 8, 2021, grant the Service Account Token Creator role.
For more information about granting IAM roles, see
Manage access . You might also be
able to get the required permissions through
custom roles or other
predefined roles .
Grant project-wide permissions
If you are the project creator, you are granted the
basic Owner role ( roles/owner ). By
default, this role includes the permissions necessary for full access to most
Google Cloud resources. Otherwise, required roles must be granted by an
administrator on the appropriate resource to the appropriate principal (also
known as a member).
For example, a principal can be a Google Account (for end users) or a service
account (for applications and compute workloads). Each principal has its own
identifier, which is typically an email address.
The Eventarc Admin role
( roles/eventarc.admin ) allows you full control over all Eventarc
resources.
Grant the role on the project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = PRINCIPAL \
--role = roles/eventarc.admin
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
PRINCIPAL : an identifier for the trigger creator
which usually has the following form:
PRINCIPAL_TYPE : ID . For example,
user:my-user@example.com . For a full list of the possible
PRINCIPAL_TYPE values, see the
Policy Binding reference .
The Service Account User role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) allows a principal to run operations as a
service account.
When creating an Eventarc trigger, you need this role so that
you can associate a user-managed service account with the trigger and which
represents its identity. For more information, see
Roles for service account authentication .
You can either grant the role on the project to allow the principal to
impersonate multiple service accounts or grant the role on the service account
to allow the principal to impersonate only a specific service account.
Grant the role on the project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = PRINCIPAL \
--role = roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
Or, grant the role on the service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
projects/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT_ID /serviceAccounts/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member = PRINCIPAL \
--role = roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud
project ID that contains the service account.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : the name of the service
account.
## Grant Eventarc trigger permissions
Every Eventarc trigger is associated with an IAM
service account at the time the trigger is created. You can specify a
user-managed service account that the trigger uses as its default identity. If
you don't specify a service account during the trigger's creation, the trigger
uses the
Compute Engine default service account
for its identity.
Caution: For production environments, we strongly recommend creating a new
service account and granting it one or more IAM roles that
contain the
minimum permissions required .
You should not use the default service account since it is automatically granted
the highly privileged basic Editor role .
We recommend that you
create your own user-managed service account
to give you greater control and flexibility when managing your trigger.
Create a service account and note its name:
gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
--description = " DESCRIPTION " \
--display-name = " DISPLAY_NAME "
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : the name of the service
account. This name appears in the email address that identifies the
service account.
DESCRIPTION : an optional description of the
service account
DISPLAY_NAME : a service account name to display in
the Google Cloud console
Grant the
Eventarc Event Receiver role
( roles/eventarc.eventReceiver ) on the project to the service account
associated with your Eventarc trigger so that it can receive
events from event providers.
Note that you don't need to grant the Eventarc Event Receiver
role if you are routing
direct events from Cloud Pub/Sub .
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/eventarc.eventReceiver
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with the name of your
service account that you noted in the previous step.
Grant the
Pub/Sub Subscriber role
( roles/pubsub.subscriber ) on the project to the service account associated
with your Eventarc trigger so that it can consume messages from
Pub/Sub and attach subscriptions to a topic.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/pubsub.subscriber
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with the name of your
service account that you noted previously.
Grant the
Monitoring Metric Writer role
( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) on the project to the service account
associated with your Eventarc trigger so that
Eventarc's event forwarder can write metrics using
Cloud Monitoring and other systems that provide metrics.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/monitoring.metricWriter
Grant permissions to Google service agents
Some Google Cloud services have
service agents that allow the services to access
your resources. If an API requires a service agent, then Google creates the
service agent after you activate and use the API.
If you are creating a trigger for direct events from Cloud Storage ,
to support publishing messages to a topic, grant the
Pub/Sub Publisher role
( roles/pubsub.publisher ) on the project to the Cloud Storage service
agent:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/pubsub.publisher
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with your Google Cloud
project number. You can find your project number on the
Welcome
page of the Google Cloud console or by running the following command:
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID --format = 'value(projectNumber)'
If you enabled the Cloud Pub/Sub service agent on or before April
8, 2021 , to support authenticated Pub/Sub push requests, grant
the
Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) on the project to the
Pub/Sub service agent. Otherwise, this role is granted by
default:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
