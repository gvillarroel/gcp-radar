— Eventarc for GKE destinations
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This tutorial shows you how to use Eventarc to build a
processing pipeline that schedules queries to a public BigQuery
dataset, generates charts based on the data, and shares links to the charts
through email.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you will build and deploy three Knative serving
services running in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster and that
receive events using Eventarc:
Query runner —Triggered when Cloud Scheduler jobs
publish a message to a Pub/Sub topic; this service uses the
BigQuery API to retrieve data from a public COVID-19 dataset,
and saves the results in a new BigQuery table.
Chart creator —Triggered when the query runner service
publishes a message to a Pub/Sub topic; this service generates
charts using the Python plotting library,
Matplotlib ,
and saves the charts to a Cloud Storage bucket.
Notifier —Triggered by audit logs when the chart creator
service stores a chart in a Cloud Storage bucket; this service
uses the email service,
SendGrid , to send links
of the charts to an email address.
The following diagram shows the high-level architecture:
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Artifact Registry
BigQuery
Cloud Build
Cloud Scheduler
Cloud Storage

real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Artifact Registry, Cloud Build, Cloud Logging, Cloud Scheduler, Eventarc, GKE, Pub/Sub, and Resource Manager APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com cloudscheduler.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com eventarc.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com logging.googleapis.com

Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Artifact Registry, Cloud Build, Cloud Logging, Cloud Scheduler, Eventarc, GKE, Pub/Sub, and Resource Manager APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com cloudscheduler.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com eventarc.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com logging.googleapis.com
For Cloud Storage, enable audit logging for the ADMIN_READ ,
DATA_WRITE , and DATA_READ data access types.
Read the Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy associated with your
Google Cloud project, folder, or organization and store it in a temporary file:
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID > /tmp/policy.yaml
In a text editor, open /tmp/policy.yaml , and add or change
only the audit log configuration in the auditConfigs section:
Caution: You must preserve the bindings: and etag: sections without
changes. Changing parts of your policy not related to audit logging might make
your Google Cloud project inaccessible.
auditConfigs :
- auditLogConfigs :
- logType : ADMIN_READ
- logType : DATA_WRITE
- logType : DATA_READ
service : storage.googleapis.com
bindings :
- members :
[ ... ]
etag : BwW_bHKTV5U=
version : 1
Write your new IAM policy:
gcloud projects set-iam-policy PROJECT_ID /tmp/policy.yaml
If the preceding command reports a conflict with another change, then
repeat these steps, starting with reading the IAM policy. For
more information, see
Configure Data Access audit logs with the API .
Set the defaults used in this tutorial:
CLUSTER_NAME = events-cluster
CLUSTER_LOCATION = us-central1
PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set run/region $CLUSTER_LOCATION
gcloud config set run/cluster $CLUSTER_NAME
gcloud config set run/cluster_location $CLUSTER_LOCATION
gcloud config set run/platform gke
gcloud config set eventarc/location $CLUSTER_LOCATION
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Create a SendGrid API key
SendGrid is a cloud-based email provider that lets you send email without
having to maintain email servers.
Sign in to SendGrid
and go to Settings > API Keys .
Click Create API Key .
Select the permissions for the key. At a minimum, the key must have
Mail Send permissions to send email.
Click Save to create the key.
SendGrid generates a new key. This is the only copy
of the key, so make sure that you copy the key and save it for later.
Create a GKE cluster
Create a cluster with Workload Identity Federation for GKE
enabled so that it can access Google Cloud services from applications
running within GKE. You also need Workload Identity Federation for GKE to
forward events using Eventarc.
Create a GKE cluster for Knative serving with
the CloudRun , HttpLoadBalancing and HorizontalPodAutoscaling addons enabled:
gcloud beta container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME \
--addons=HttpLoadBalancing,HorizontalPodAutoscaling,CloudRun \
--machine-type=n1-standard-4 \
--enable-autoscaling --min-nodes=2 --max-nodes=10 \
--no-issue-client-certificate --num-nodes=2 \
--logging=SYSTEM,WORKLOAD \
--monitoring=SYSTEM \
--scopes=cloud-platform,logging-write,monitoring-write,pubsub \
--zone us-central1 \
--release-channel=rapid \
--workload-pool=$PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog
Wait a few minutes for the cluster creation to complete. During the process,
you might see warnings that you can safely ignore. When the cluster has been
created, the output is similar to the following:
Creating cluster ...done.
Created [https://container.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1/clusters/events-cluster].
Create an Artifact Registry standard repository to store your
Docker container image:
gcloud artifacts repositories create REPOSITORY \
--repository-format = docker \
--location = $CLUSTER_LOCATION
Replace REPOSITORY with a unique name for the
repository.
Configure the GKE service account
Configure a GKE service account to act as the default compute
service account.
Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) binding between the service accounts:
PROJECT_NUMBER = " $( gcloud projects describe $( gcloud config get-value project ) --format = 'value(projectNumber)' ) "
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
--role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
--member "serviceAccount: $PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog[default/default]" \
$PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Add the iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account annotation to the GKE
service account, using the email address of the compute service account:
kubectl annotate serviceaccount \
--namespace default \
default \
iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account = $PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Enable GKE destinations
To allow Eventarc to manage resources in the GKE
cluster, enable GKE destinations and bind the Eventarc
service account with the required roles.
Enable GKE destinations for Eventarc:
gcloud eventarc gke-destinations init
At the prompt to bind the required roles, enter y .
The following roles are bound:
roles/compute.viewer
roles/container.developer
roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin
Create a service account and bind access roles
Before creating the Eventarc trigger, set up a user-managed
service account and grant it specific roles so that Eventarc
can forward Pub/Sub events.
Create a service account called TRIGGER_GSA :
TRIGGER_GSA = eventarc-bigquery-triggers
gcloud iam service-accounts create $TRIGGER_GSA
Grant the pubsub.subscriber , monitoring.metricWriter , and
eventarc.eventReceiver roles to the service account:
PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get-value project )
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
--member "serviceAccount: $TRIGGER_GSA @ $PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role "roles/pubsub.subscriber"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
--member "serviceAccount: $TRIGGER_GSA @ $PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role "roles/monitoring.metricWriter"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
--member "serviceAccount: $TRIGGER_GSA @ $PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role "roles/eventarc.eventReceiver"
Create a Cloud Storage bucket
Create a Cloud Storage bucket to save the charts. Make sure
that the bucket and the charts are publicly available, and in the same region
as your GKE service:
export BUCKET = " $( gcloud config get-value core/project ) -charts"
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// ${ BUCKET } --location = $( gcloud config get-value run/region )
gcloud storage buckets update gs:// ${ BUCKET } --uniform-bucket-level-access
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// ${ BUCKET } --member = allUsers --role = roles/storage.objectViewer
Clone the repository
Clone the GitHub repository.
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/eventarc-samples
cd eventarc-samples/processing-pipelines
Deploy the notifier service
From the bigquery/notifier/python directory, deploy a
Knative serving service that receives chart creator events and
uses SendGrid to email links to the generated charts.
Build and push the container image:
pushd bigquery/notifier/python
export SERVICE_NAME = notifier
docker build -t $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY / ${ SERVICE_NAME } :v1 .
docker push $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY / ${ SERVICE_NAME } :v1
popd
Deploy the container image to Knative serving, passing in an
address to send emails to, and the SendGrid API key:
export TO_EMAILS = EMAIL_ADDRESS
export SENDGRID_API_KEY = YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY
gcloud run deploy ${ SERVICE_NAME } \
--image $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY / ${ SERVICE_NAME } :v1 \
--update-env-vars TO_EMAILS = ${ TO_EMAILS } ,SENDGRID_API_KEY = ${ SENDGRID_API_KEY } ,BUCKET = ${ BUCKET }
Replace the following:
EMAIL_ADDRESS : an email address to send the links to the
generated charts
YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY : the SendGrid API key you noted
previously
When you see the service URL, the deployment is complete.
Note: It can take a few minutes before permissions are propagated
to the service and before you can create a trigger.
Create a trigger for the notifier service
The Eventarc trigger for the notifier service deployed on
Knative serving filters for Cloud Storage audit logs
where the methodName is storage.objects.create .
Create the trigger:
gcloud eventarc triggers create trigger- ${ SERVICE_NAME } -gke \
--destination-gke-cluster = $CLUSTER_NAME \
--destination-gke-location = $CLUSTER_LOCATION \
--destination-gke-namespace = default \
--destination-gke-service = $SERVICE_NAME \
--destination-gke-path = / \
--event-filters = "type=google.cloud.audit.log.v1.written" \
--event-filters = "serviceName=storage.googleapis.com" \
--event-filters = "methodName=storage.objects.create" \
--service-account = $TRIGGER_GSA @ $PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
This creates a trigger called trigger-notifier-gke .
Deploy the chart creator service
From the bigquery/chart-creator/python directory, deploy a Knative serving
service that receives query runner events, retrieves data from a BigQuery
table for a specific country, and then generates a chart, using Matplotlib, from
the data. The chart is uploaded to a Cloud Storage bucket.
Build and push the container image:
pushd bigquery/chart-creator/python
export SERVICE_NAME = chart-creator
docker build -t $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY / ${ SERVICE_NAME } :v1 .
docker push $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY / ${ SERVICE_NAME } :v1
popd
Deploy the container image to Knative serving, passing in
BUCKET :
gcloud run deploy ${ SERVICE_NAME } \
--image $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY / ${ SERVICE_NAME } :v1 \
--update-env-vars BUCKET = ${ BUCKET }
When you see the service URL, the deployment is complete.
Create a trigger for the chart creator service
The Eventarc trigger for the chart creator service deployed on
Knative serving filters for messages published to a
Pub/Sub topic.
Create the trigger:
gcloud eventarc triggers create trigger- ${ SERVICE_NAME } -gke \
--destination-gke-cluster = $CLUSTER_NAME \
--destination-gke-location = $CLUSTER_LOCATION \
--destination-gke-namespace = default \
--destination-gke-service = $SERVICE_NAME \
--destination-gke-path = / \
--event-filters = "type=google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished" \
--service-account = $TRIGGER_GSA @ $PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
This creates a trigger called trigger-chart-creator-gke .
Set the Pub/Sub topic environment variable.
export TOPIC_QUERY_COMPLETED = $( basename $( gcloud eventarc triggers describe trigger- ${ SERVICE_NAME } -gke --format = 'value(transport.pubsub.topic)' ))
Deploy the query runner service
From the processing-pipelines directory, deploy a Knative serving
service that receives Cloud Scheduler events, retrieves data from a
public COVID-19 dataset, and saves the results in a new BigQuery
table.
Build and push the container image:
export SERVICE_NAME = query-runner
docker build -t $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY / ${ SERVICE_NAME } :v1 -f Dockerfile .
docker push $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY / ${ SERVICE_NAME } :v1
Deploy the container image to Knative serving, passing in
PROJECT_ID and TOPIC_QUERY_COMPLETED :
gcloud run deploy ${ SERVICE_NAME } \
--image $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY / ${ SERVICE_NAME } :v1 \
--update-env-vars PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get-value project ) ,TOPIC_ID = ${ TOPIC_QUERY_COMPLETED }
When you see the service URL, the deployment is complete.
Create a trigger for the query runner service
The Eventarc trigger for the query runner service deployed on
Knative serving filters for messages published to a
Pub/Sub topic.
Create the trigger:
gcloud eventarc triggers create trigger- ${ SERVICE_NAME } -gke \
--destination-gke-cluster = $CLUSTER_NAME \
--destination-gke-location = $CLUSTER_LOCATION \
--destination-gke-namespace = default \
--destination-gke-service = $SERVICE_NAME \
--destination-gke-path = / \
--event-filters = "type=google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished" \
--service-account = $TRIGGER_GSA @ $PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
This creates a trigger called trigger-query-runner-gke .
Set an environment variable for the Pub/Sub topic.
export TOPIC_QUERY_SCHEDULED = $( gcloud eventarc triggers describe trigger- ${ SERVICE_NAME } -gke --format = 'value(transport.pubsub.topic)' )
Schedule the jobs
The processing pipeline is triggered by two Cloud Scheduler jobs.
Create an App Engine app which is required by Cloud Scheduler
and specify an appropriate
location (for example, europe-west ):
export APP_ENGINE_LOCATION = LOCATION
gcloud app create --region = ${ APP_ENGINE_LOCATION }
Create two Cloud Scheduler jobs that publish to a Pub/Sub
topic once per day:
gcloud scheduler jobs create pubsub cre-scheduler-uk \
--schedule = "0 16 * * *" \
--topic = ${ TOPIC_QUERY_SCHEDULED } \
--message-body = "United Kingdom"
gcloud scheduler jobs create pubsub cre-scheduler-cy \
--schedule = "0 17 * * *" \
--topic = ${ TOPIC_QUERY_SCHEDULED } \
--message-body = "Cyprus"
The schedule is specified in unix-cron format .
For example, 0 16 * * * means that the jobs runs at 16:00 (4 PM) UTC every
day.
Run the pipeline
Confirm that all the triggers were successfully created:
gcloud eventarc triggers list
Note: It can take up to two minutes for triggers to be fully functional.
The output should be similar to the following:
NAME TYPE DESTINATION ACTIVE LOCATION
trigger-chart-creator-gke google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished GKE:chart-creator Yes us-central1
trigger-notifier-gke google.cloud.audit.log.v1.written GKE:notifier Yes us-central1
trigger-query-runner-gke google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished GKE:query-runner Yes us-central1
Retrieve the Cloud Scheduler job IDs:
gcloud scheduler jobs list
The output should be similar to the following:
ID LOCATION SCHEDULE (TZ) TARGET_TYPE STATE
cre-scheduler-cy us-central1 0 17 * * * (Etc/UTC) Pub/Sub ENABLED
cre-scheduler-uk us-central1 0 16 * * * (Etc/UTC) Pub/Sub ENABLED
Although the jobs are scheduled to run daily at 4 and 5 PM, you can also run
the Cloud Scheduler jobs manually:
gcloud scheduler jobs run cre-scheduler-cy
gcloud scheduler jobs run cre-scheduler-uk
After a few minutes, confirm that there are two charts in the Cloud Storage
bucket:
gcloud storage ls gs:// ${ BUCKET }
The output should be similar to the following:
gs:// PROJECT_ID -charts/chart-cyprus.png
gs:// PROJECT_ID -charts/chart-unitedkingdom.png
Congratulations! You should also receive two emails with links to the charts.
Clean up
If you created a new project for this tutorial, delete the project. If you used
an existing project and want to keep it without the changes added
in this tutorial, delete the resources created for the tutorial .
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete tutorial resources
Delete any Knative serving services you deployed in this
tutorial:
gcloud run services delete SERVICE_NAME
Where SERVICE_NAME is your chosen service name.
You can also delete Knative serving services from the
Google Cloud console .
Delete any Eventarc triggers you created in this tutorial:
gcloud eventarc triggers delete TRIGGER_NAME
Replace TRIGGER_NAME with the name of your trigger.
Remove any Google Cloud CLI default configurations you added during the
tutorial setup.
gcloud config unset project
gcloud config unset run/cluster
gcloud config unset run/cluster_location
gcloud config unset run/platform
gcloud config unset eventarc/location
gcloud config unset compute/zone
Delete the images from Artifact Registry.
gcloud artifacts docker images delete $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY /notifier:v1
gcloud artifacts docker images delete $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY /chart-creator:v1
gcloud artifacts docker images delete $CLUSTER_LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ $( gcloud config get-value project ) / REPOSITORY /query-runner:v1
Delete the bucket, along with all the objects within the bucket:
gcloud storage rm --recursive gs://${BUCKET}/
Delete the Cloud Scheduler jobs:
gcloud scheduler jobs delete cre-scheduler-cy
gcloud scheduler jobs delete cre-scheduler-uk
