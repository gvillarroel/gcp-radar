Tool: create_endpoint
Creates a Vertex AI Endpoint resource within a Google Cloud project. This acts as a logical serving host and stable URL for online predictions. Create this first before deploying any models for real-time inference. Format: 'projects/{project_id}/locations/{region}'. CRITICAL: For {region}, use the region specified in the current context window. If no region is specified, prompt the user to provide one. Do not use 'global'.
The following sample demonstrate how to use curl to invoke the create_endpoint MCP tool.

"scaleToZeroSpec" : {
object ( ScaleToZeroSpec )
}
}
Fields
machineSpec
object ( MachineSpec )
Required. Immutable. The specification of a single machine being used.
minReplicaCount
integer
Required. Immutable. The minimum number of machine replicas that will be always deployed on. This value must be greater than or equal to 1.
If traffic increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.
maxReplicaCount
integer
Immutable. The maximum number of replicas that may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, will use min_replica_count as the default value.
The value of this field impacts the charge against Vertex CPU and GPU quotas. Specifically, you will be charged for (max_replica_count * number of cores in the selected machine type) and (max_replica_count * number of GPUs per replica in the selected machine type).
requiredReplicaCount
integer
Optional. Number of required available replicas for the deployment to succeed. This field is only needed when partial deployment/mutation is desired. If set, the deploy/mutate operation will succeed once available_replica_count reaches required_replica_count, and the rest of the replicas will be retried. If not set, the default required_replica_count will be min_replica_count.
initialReplicaCount
integer
Immutable. Number of initial replicas being deployed on when scaling the workload up from zero or when creating the workload in case min_replica_count = 0. When min_replica_count > 0 (meaning that the scale-to-zero feature is not enabled), initial_replica_count should not be set. When min_replica_count = 0 (meaning that the scale-to-zero feature is enabled), initial_replica_count should be larger than zero, but no greater than max_replica_count .
autoscalingMetricSpecs[]
object ( AutoscalingMetricSpec )
Immutable. The metric specifications that overrides a resource utilization metric (CPU utilization, accelerator's duty cycle, and so on) target value (default to 60 if not set). At most one entry is allowed per metric.
If machine_spec.accelerator_count is above 0, the autoscaling will be based on both CPU utilization and accelerator's duty cycle metrics and scale up when either metrics exceeds its target value while scale down if both metrics are under their target value. The default target value is 60 for both metrics.
If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target value 60 if not explicitly set.
For example, in the case of Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU utilization to 80, you should set autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to 80 .
spot
boolean
Optional. If true, schedule the deployment workload on spot VMs .
flexStart
object ( FlexStart )
Optional. Immutable. If set, use DWS resource to schedule the deployment workload. reference: ( https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-dynamic-workload-scheduler )
scaleToZeroSpec

Fields
machineType
string
Immutable. The type of the machine.
See the list of machine types supported for prediction
See the list of machine types supported for custom training .
For DeployedModel this field is optional, and the default value is n1-standard-2 . For BatchPredictionJob or as part of WorkerPoolSpec this field is required.
acceleratorType
enum ( AcceleratorType )
Immutable. The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached to the machine as per accelerator_count .
acceleratorCount
integer
The number of accelerators to attach to the machine.
For accelerator optimized machine types ( https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/accelerator-optimized-machines) , One may set the accelerator_count from 1 to N for machine with N GPUs. If accelerator_count is less than or equal to N / 2, Vertex will co-schedule the replicas of the model into the same VM to save cost.
For example, if the machine type is a3-highgpu-8g, which has 8 H100 GPUs, one can set accelerator_count to 1 to 8. If accelerator_count is 1, 2, 3, or 4, Vertex will co-schedule 8, 4, 2, or 2 replicas of the model into the same VM to save cost.
When co-scheduling, CPU, memory and storage on the VM will be distributed to replicas on the VM. For example, one can expect a co-scheduled replica requesting 2 GPUs out of a 8-GPU VM will receive 25% of the CPU, memory and storage of the VM.
Note that the feature is not compatible with multihost_gpu_node_count . When multihost_gpu_node_count is set, the co-scheduling will not be enabled.
gpuPartitionSize
string
Optional. Immutable. The Nvidia GPU partition size.
When specified, the requested accelerators will be partitioned into smaller GPU partitions. For example, if the request is for 8 units of NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and gpu_partition_size="1g.10gb", the service will create 8 * 7 = 56 partitioned MIG instances.
The partition size must be a value supported by the requested accelerator. Refer to Nvidia GPU Partitioning for the available partition sizes.
If set, the accelerator_count should be set to 1.
tpuTopology
string
Immutable. The topology of the TPUs. Corresponds to the TPU topologies available from GKE. (Example: tpu_topology: "2x2x1").

sampledShapleyAttribution
object ( SampledShapleyAttribution )
An attribution method that approximates Shapley values for features that contribute to the label being predicted. A sampling strategy is used to approximate the value rather than considering all subsets of features. Refer to this paper for model details: https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4265 .
integratedGradientsAttribution
object ( IntegratedGradientsAttribution )
An attribution method that computes Aumann-Shapley values taking advantage of the model's fully differentiable structure. Refer to this paper for more details: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365

{
"ragConfig" : {
object ( RagConfig )
}
}
Fields
ragConfig
object ( RagConfig )
Configuration for Retrieval Augmented Generation feature.
RagConfig
JSON representation
{
"enableRag" : boolean
}
Fields
enableRag
boolean
If true, enable Retrieval Augmented Generation in ChatCompletion request. Once enabled, the endpoint will be identified as GenAI endpoint and Arthedain router will be used.
Output Schema
This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
Operation
JSON representation
{
"name" : string ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
} ,
"done" : boolean ,
// Union field result can be only one of the following:
"error" : {
object ( Status )
} ,
"response" : {
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
}
// End of list of possible types for union field result .
}
Fields
name
string
The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should be a resource name ending with operations/{unique_id} .
metadata
object
Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
done
boolean
If the value is false , it means the operation is still in progress. If true , the operation is completed, and either error or response is available.
Union field result . The operation result, which can be either an error or a valid response . If done == false , neither error nor response is set. If done == true , exactly one of error or response can be set. Some services might not provide the result. result can be only one of the following:
error
object ( Status )
The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
response
object
The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete , the response is google.protobuf.Empty . If the original method is standard Get / Create / Update , the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse , where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot() , the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse .
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
Any
JSON representation
{
"typeUrl" : string ,
"value" : string
}
Fields
typeUrl
string
Identifies the type of the serialized Protobuf message with a URI reference consisting of a prefix ending in a slash and the fully-qualified type name.
Example: type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValue
This string must contain at least one / character, and the content after the last / must be the fully-qualified name of the type in canonical form, without a leading dot. Do not write a scheme on these URI references so that clients do not attempt to contact them.
The prefix is arbitrary and Protobuf implementations are expected to simply strip off everything up to and including the last / to identify the type. type.googleapis.com/ is a common default prefix that some legacy implementations require. This prefix does not indicate the origin of the type, and URIs containing it are not expected to respond to any requests.
All type URL strings must be legal URI references with the additional restriction (for the text format) that the content of the reference must consist only of alphanumeric characters, percent-encoded escapes, and characters in the following set (not including the outer backticks): /-.~_!$&()*+,;= . Despite our allowing percent encodings, implementations should not unescape them to prevent confusion with existing parsers. For example, type.googleapis.com%2FFoo should be rejected.
In the original design of Any , the possibility of launching a type resolution service at these type URLs was considered but Protobuf never implemented one and considers contacting these URLs to be problematic and a potential security issue. Do not attempt to contact type URLs.
value
string ( bytes format)
Holds a Protobuf serialization of the type described by type_url.
A base64-encoded string.
Status
JSON representation
{
"code" : integer ,
"message" : string ,
"details" : [
{
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
}
]
}
Fields
code
integer
The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code .
message
string
A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
details[]
object
A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
