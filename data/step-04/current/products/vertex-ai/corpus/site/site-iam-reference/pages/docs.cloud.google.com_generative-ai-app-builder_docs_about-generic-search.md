Introduction to custom search
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page introduces and lists the capabilities of Vertex AI Search
for custom apps. The page also provides links to the available
features, tutorials, and checklists, to get you started with
Vertex AI Search for custom apps.
What is Vertex AI Search for custom apps?
Vertex AI Search for custom apps is a powerful,
Google-quality search and content discovery engine that you can integrate into
your applications that contain website data and other structured or unstructured
data. The search capability is beyond basic keyword matching and uses AI to
deliver highly relevant results, provide personalized browse and search
experiences, and generate AI answers grounded in your data.
You can use custom search app for vertical-agnostic data
that's on public websites or is in structured or unstructured format.
Additionally, Vertex AI Search offers other vertical-specific search and
recommendations apps.

Key capabilities
The key capabilities of Vertex AI Search are as follows:
High-quality search: Leverages Google's search expertise to understand
user intent, even with complex queries and natural language queries. It
combines keyword and semantic search to serve the best results.
Personalized browse: Provides personalized results without a
specific search query and personalized feed based on a user's context and
navigation patterns. It is ideal for discovery experiences to view
personalized category pages and home feeds.
Data sources: Works with the following variety of data sources:
Website: Index your public websites and use advanced features, such as
index enrichment with the structured data in your websites.
Structured Data: Search over data organized in a defined format, such as
databases, JSON files in Cloud Storage, or BigQuery
tables—for example, hotel catalogs, real estate listings, and
restaurant directories.
Unstructured Data: Search over documents like PDFs, HTML files, and TXT
files or image files like JPEG and PNG files that are stored in
Cloud Storage or BigQuery.
Blended Search: Search over multiple data stores that blend data from
the data sources mentioned above. For example, you can create a search app
and connect it to a website data store and a document data store. This
lets your users search over all of your content at once.
Grounded AI answer generation: Generates AI answers grounded in your data,
with citations to the source documents. You can also ask follow up questions
and related queries.
Personalization: Improves results and ranking over time by learning from
user interactions captured in user events, such as clicks and conversions.
Customization: Offers several ways to tune and configure the search and
browse experience fit for your business needs.
Overview
The following diagram shows the key components of custom search and
how they work together:
Figure 1. Different components of custom search
The components of Vertex AI Search for custom search can be
explained as follows:
Data store : Your content from different data sources is stored in a
Vertex AI Search data store. The source data can be public website
data or structured and unstructured data.
Data processing and indexing : Vertex AI Search understands and
indexes your data, creating a searchable and retrievable representation. This
includes the following:
Keyword extraction: Identifies and generates important terms necessary
to retrieve the correct information.
Semantic understanding using embeddings: Creates vector embeddings to
capture the meaning of the content.
Metadata processing: Processes your documents using the document's
structured data or metadata. For example, location in a hotel catalog,
modification or creation dates in a web page's metadata.
Advanced document parsing: Understands document structure and annotates
advanced information, such as tables, images, and graphs, using OCR or
layout parsing.
Search app : At the heart of the custom search is a search app,
which connects to one or more data stores that bring data from different
sources. For blended search, the data is ingested through connectors . You
configure the search and browse behavior at the app level.
User query : The input from a user intended to retrieve information from
your app, which can be of two types:
Search query: The user enters a targeted search query using text or images.
Textual search is powered by autocomplete.
Navigational query or browse: An exploratory search to deliver personalized
relevant content with no specific query. It is powered by the user's past
activity and other signals, such as current category page and location.
Retrieval and ranking: There are several sub-components to retrieval and
ranking of results:
Query understanding for search: Vertex AI Search analyzes a
search query using the following:
Natural language processing: To understand the intent.
Filters with natural language understanding: Translates locations
from natural language
queries into geo-coordinates and the conditions in natural language
queries into filters.
Knowledge graph: To disambiguate terms and expand the search.
Optional features: Includes spelling correction, synonyms, and query
rephrasing.
Retrieval: Vertex AI Search finds the most relevant documents
or chunks based on the following methods:
Keyword matching for search: Conventional search based on terms.
Semantic search: Using embeddings to find conceptually similar
content.
Filtering: Applying any filters you've configured—for example, date,
category, or relevance score.
Ranking: Vertex AI Search ranks the results based on the
following factors:
Relevance: A combination of keyword and semantic matching during
search.
Web signals for website search: Factors like page quality and
popularity.
Boosting and burying: Your custom rules to promote or demote certain
results.
Personalization: Learning from user interactions. This is optional
but highly recommended.
Ordering: Applying ordering instructions, for example, by date.
Results and answer generation:
Search results: A ranked list of relevant documents or chunks is
returned with optional features, such as snippets, extractive answers, and
extractive segments. The results that are served can be configured with the
help of serving controls. You can also tune the search results.
Answer generation: A concise, synthesized answer is generated based on
the top and relevant results, with citations. This uses advanced LLM
features.
Personalized browse: A personalized set of documents with the highest
predicted likelihood of engagement or conversion is returned. This
prediction uses an advanced model that learns from user interactions.
User events: A tracker for user interactions, such as clicks and views,
that helps Vertex AI Search learn and improve search and
personalization. User events aid in optimizing your business KPIs including
engagement, conversion, and revenue.
Key features and configurations
The following features and configurations are available for your
custom search apps. At each stage you can customize these settings to
serve the best results to your users.
