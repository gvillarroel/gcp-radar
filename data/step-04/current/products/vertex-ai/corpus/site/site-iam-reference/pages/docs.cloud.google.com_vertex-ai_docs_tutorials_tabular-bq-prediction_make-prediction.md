Make an inference
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You're now ready to use the test data in df_for_prediction to make an inference
request. The inference request invokes your model to predict what species of
penguin is represented by the penguin characteristics in each row in
df_for_prediction .
Prepare inference test data
Before you can use the test data to create inferences, you remove the species
column. Because the species of penguin is what you're predicting, it can't be
included in the test data used to create an inference. After you remove the
species column, you convert the data to a Python list because that's what the
predict method takes as input. Run the following code convert your data
to a Python list:
# Remove the species column
df_for_prediction.pop(LABEL_COLUMN)
# Convert data to a Python list
test_data_list = df_for_prediction.values.tolist()
(Optional) View test data
To help you understand the test data, you can run the following line of code to
view it:
test_data_list
In each row, the respective values in each of the six columns refer to the following
characteristics of one penguin:
Column
Penguin characteristic
0
island - The island where a species of penguin is found. The island value mapping is 0 for Dream , 1 for Biscoe , and 2 for Torgersen .
1
culmen_length_mm - The length of the ridge along the top of the bill of a penguin.
2
culmen_depth_mm - The height of the bill of a penguin.
3
flipper_length_mm - The length of the flipper-like wing of a penguin.
4
body_mass_g - The mass of the body of a pen.
5
sex - The sex of the penguin. 0 is FEMALE and 1 is MALE .
Send the inference request
To create an inference request, pass the Python list of test data you created to
the endpoint 's
predict method.
The predict method evaluates the characteristics in each row and uses them to
predict what kind of penguin they represent. Run the following code to create
your inferences. The returned inferences contain a list of rows, where each
row has three columns ( Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) (column 1),
Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) (column 2), or Gentoo penguin
(Pygoscelis papua) (column 3)).
# Get your inferences.
predictions = endpoint.predict(instances=test_data_list)
# View the inferences
predictions.predictions
Each column in a row contains a value, and the higher the value, the greater the
confidence that the species of the penguin represented by that column is a
correct inference. For example, in the following sample inference output row,
the model uses the characteristics of the sample penguin data row to predict
that the penguin is most likely of the Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
species. This is because the highest value, 0.732703805 , is in the first
column.
[0.732703805, 0.233752429, 0.0335437432]
In the following code, the NumPy argmax method returns the column for each row
that contains the highest value. The highest value corresponds to the inference
that is most likely correct. The second line displays the array of inferences.
# Get the inference for each set of input data.
species_predictions = np.argmax(predictions.predictions, axis=1)
# View the best inference for the penguin characteristics in each row.
species_predictions
Each result in the species_predictions array predicts which penguin species
the values in the corresponding row of test data corresponds to. For example,
the first value is 0 , which maps to the Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)
species. This means that your model predicts that the species of a penguin with
the characteristics in the first row of your test data is Adelie Penguin
(Pygoscelis adeliae) .
Clean up resources
Now that you're done, you can continue to use your notebook to explore and learn
more about the resources you created and how they work.
Delete your resources
When you're ready, we recommend that you delete the Google Cloud resources you
created during this tutorial so that you don't incur unnecessary charges. There
are two ways to delete your resources:
Delete your project, which also deletes all the resources associated with your
project. For more information, see Shutting down (deleting)
projects .
Run code that deletes your training job (a CustomTrainingJob object), model
(a Model object), endpoint (an Endpoint object), and Cloud Storage
bucket. This option retains your project and any other resources you might
have created that you don't explicitly delete with your code.
You must undeploy your model before you can delete it by passing force=True
to the
endpoint.delete
method.
To retain your project and delete only resources you created during this
tutorial, run the following code in your notebook:
import os
# Delete the training job
job . delete ()
# Delete the endpoint and undeploy the model from it
endpoint . delete ( force = True )
# Delete the model
model . delete ()
# Delete the storage bucket and its contents
bucket . delete ( force = True )
Delete your Vertex AI Workbench instance
You can keep your Vertex AI Workbench instance to use for future
work. If you keep it, make sure you are aware of its cost. For more
information, see Vertex AI Workbench
pricing .
If you want to delete the Vertex AI Workbench instance,
do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Vertex AI Workbench Instances page.
Go to Instances
Select your Vertex AI Workbench instance.
In the upper menu, click
delete Delete .
In the Delete instance confirmation dialog, click Confirm . It takes
a few minutes for the deletion to complete.
