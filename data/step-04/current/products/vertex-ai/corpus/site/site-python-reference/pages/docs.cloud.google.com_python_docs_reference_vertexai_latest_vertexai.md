Updates common initialization parameters with provided options.
Parameters
Name
Description
project
str The default project to use when making API calls.
location
str The default location to use when making API calls. If not set defaults to us-central-1.
experiment
str Optional. The experiment name.
experiment_description
str Optional. The description of the experiment.
experiment_tensorboard
Union[str, tensorboard_resource.Tensorboard, bool] Optional. The Vertex AI TensorBoard instance, Tensorboard resource name, or Tensorboard resource ID to use as a backing Tensorboard for the provided experiment. Example tensorboard resource name format: "projects/123/locations/us-central1/tensorboards/456" If experiment_tensorboard is provided and experiment is not, the provided experiment_tensorboard will be set as the global Tensorboard. Any subsequent calls to aiplatform.init() with experiment and without experiment_tensorboard will automatically assign the global Tensorboard to the experiment . If experiment_tensorboard is ommitted or set to True or None the global Tensorboard will be assigned to the experiment . If a global Tensorboard is not set, the default Tensorboard instance will be used, and created if it does not exist. To disable creating and using Tensorboard with experiment , set experiment_tensorboard to False . Any subsequent calls to aiplatform.init() should include this setting as well.
staging_bucket
str The default staging bucket to use to stage artifacts when making API calls. In the form gs://...
credentials
google.auth.credentials.Credentials The default custom credentials to use when making API calls. If not provided credentials will be ascertained from the environment.
encryption_spec_key_name
Optional[str] Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer managed encryption key used to protect a resource. Has the form: projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key . The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created. If set, this resource and all sub-resources will be secured by this key.
network
str Optional. The full name of the Compute Engine network to which jobs and resources should be peered. E.g. "projects/12345/global/networks/myVPC". Private services access must already be configured for the network. If specified, all eligible jobs and resources created will be peered with this VPC.
service_account
str Optional. The service account used to launch jobs and deploy models. Jobs that use service_account: BatchPredictionJob, CustomJob, PipelineJob, HyperparameterTuningJob, CustomTrainingJob, CustomPythonPackageTrainingJob, CustomContainerTrainingJob, ModelEvaluationJob.
api_endpoint
str Optional. The desired API endpoint, e.g., us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com
api_key
str Optional. The API key to use for service calls. NOTE: Not all services support API keys.
api_transport
str Optional. The transport method which is either 'grpc' or 'rest'. NOTE: "rest" transport functionality is currently in a beta state (preview).
