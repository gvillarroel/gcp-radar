Any
JSON representation
{
"typeUrl" : string ,
"value" : string
}
Fields
typeUrl
string
Identifies the type of the serialized Protobuf message with a URI reference consisting of a prefix ending in a slash and the fully-qualified type name.
Example: type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValue
This string must contain at least one / character, and the content after the last / must be the fully-qualified name of the type in canonical form, without a leading dot. Do not write a scheme on these URI references so that clients do not attempt to contact them.
The prefix is arbitrary and Protobuf implementations are expected to simply strip off everything up to and including the last / to identify the type. type.googleapis.com/ is a common default prefix that some legacy implementations require. This prefix does not indicate the origin of the type, and URIs containing it are not expected to respond to any requests.
All type URL strings must be legal URI references with the additional restriction (for the text format) that the content of the reference must consist only of alphanumeric characters, percent-encoded escapes, and characters in the following set (not including the outer backticks): /-.~_!$&()*+,;= . Despite our allowing percent encodings, implementations should not unescape them to prevent confusion with existing parsers. For example, type.googleapis.com%2FFoo should be rejected.
In the original design of Any , the possibility of launching a type resolution service at these type URLs was considered but Protobuf never implemented one and considers contacting these URLs to be problematic and a potential security issue. Do not attempt to contact type URLs.

}
Fields
machineType
string
Immutable. The type of the machine.
See the list of machine types supported for prediction
See the list of machine types supported for custom training .
For DeployedModel this field is optional, and the default value is n1-standard-2 . For BatchPredictionJob or as part of WorkerPoolSpec this field is required.
acceleratorType
enum ( AcceleratorType )
Immutable. The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached to the machine as per accelerator_count .
acceleratorCount
integer
The number of accelerators to attach to the machine.
For accelerator optimized machine types ( https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/accelerator-optimized-machines) , One may set the accelerator_count from 1 to N for machine with N GPUs. If accelerator_count is less than or equal to N / 2, Vertex will co-schedule the replicas of the model into the same VM to save cost.
For example, if the machine type is a3-highgpu-8g, which has 8 H100 GPUs, one can set accelerator_count to 1 to 8. If accelerator_count is 1, 2, 3, or 4, Vertex will co-schedule 8, 4, 2, or 2 replicas of the model into the same VM to save cost.
When co-scheduling, CPU, memory and storage on the VM will be distributed to replicas on the VM. For example, one can expect a co-scheduled replica requesting 2 GPUs out of a 8-GPU VM will receive 25% of the CPU, memory and storage of the VM.
Note that the feature is not compatible with [multihost_gpu_node_count][]. When multihost_gpu_node_count is set, the co-scheduling will not be enabled.
gpuPartitionSize
string
Optional. Immutable. The Nvidia GPU partition size.
When specified, the requested accelerators will be partitioned into smaller GPU partitions. For example, if the request is for 8 units of NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and gpu_partition_size="1g.10gb", the service will create 8 * 7 = 56 partitioned MIG instances.
The partition size must be a value supported by the requested accelerator. Refer to Nvidia GPU Partitioning for the available partition sizes.
If set, the accelerator_count should be set to 1.
tpuTopology
string
Immutable. The topology of the TPUs. Corresponds to the TPU topologies available from GKE. (Example: tpu_topology: "2x2x1").
reservationAffinity
object ( ReservationAffinity )

Any
JSON representation
{
"typeUrl" : string ,
"value" : string
}
Fields
typeUrl
string
Identifies the type of the serialized Protobuf message with a URI reference consisting of a prefix ending in a slash and the fully-qualified type name.
Example: type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValue
This string must contain at least one / character, and the content after the last / must be the fully-qualified name of the type in canonical form, without a leading dot. Do not write a scheme on these URI references so that clients do not attempt to contact them.
The prefix is arbitrary and Protobuf implementations are expected to simply strip off everything up to and including the last / to identify the type. type.googleapis.com/ is a common default prefix that some legacy implementations require. This prefix does not indicate the origin of the type, and URIs containing it are not expected to respond to any requests.
All type URL strings must be legal URI references with the additional restriction (for the text format) that the content of the reference must consist only of alphanumeric characters, percent-encoded escapes, and characters in the following set (not including the outer backticks): /-.~_!$&()*+,;= . Despite our allowing percent encodings, implementations should not unescape them to prevent confusion with existing parsers. For example, type.googleapis.com%2FFoo should be rejected.
In the original design of Any , the possibility of launching a type resolution service at these type URLs was considered but Protobuf never implemented one and considers contacting these URLs to be problematic and a potential security issue. Do not attempt to contact type URLs.

If accelerator_count is less than or equal to N / 2, Vertex will co-schedule the replicas of the model into the same VM to save cost.
For example, if the machine type is a3-highgpu-8g, which has 8 H100 GPUs, one can set accelerator_count to 1 to 8. If accelerator_count is 1, 2, 3, or 4, Vertex will co-schedule 8, 4, 2, or 2 replicas of the model into the same VM to save cost.
When co-scheduling, CPU, memory and storage on the VM will be distributed to replicas on the VM. For example, one can expect a co-scheduled replica requesting 2 GPUs out of a 8-GPU VM will receive 25% of the CPU, memory and storage of the VM.
Note that the feature is not compatible with [multihost_gpu_node_count][]. When multihost_gpu_node_count is set, the co-scheduling will not be enabled.
gpuPartitionSize
string
Optional. Immutable. The Nvidia GPU partition size.
When specified, the requested accelerators will be partitioned into smaller GPU partitions. For example, if the request is for 8 units of NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and gpu_partition_size="1g.10gb", the service will create 8 * 7 = 56 partitioned MIG instances.
The partition size must be a value supported by the requested accelerator. Refer to Nvidia GPU Partitioning for the available partition sizes.
If set, the accelerator_count should be set to 1.
tpuTopology
string
Immutable. The topology of the TPUs. Corresponds to the TPU topologies available from GKE. (Example: tpu_topology: "2x2x1").
reservationAffinity
object ( ReservationAffinity )
Optional. Immutable. Configuration controlling how this resource pool consumes reservation.
ReservationAffinity
JSON representation
{
"reservationAffinityType" : enum ( Type ) ,
"key" : string ,
"values" : [
string
]
}
Fields
reservationAffinityType
enum ( Type )
Required. Specifies the reservation affinity type.
key
string
Optional. Corresponds to the label key of a reservation resource. To target a SPECIFIC_RESERVATION by name, use compute.googleapis.com/reservation-name as the key and specify the name of your reservation as its value.
values[]
string
Optional. Corresponds to the label values of a reservation resource. This must be the full resource name of the reservation or reservation block.
PersistentDiskSpec
JSON representation
{
"diskType" : string ,
"diskSizeGb" : string
}
Fields
diskType
string
Type of the disk (default is "pd-standard"). Valid values: "pd-ssd" (Persistent Disk Solid State Drive) "pd-standard" (Persistent Disk Hard Disk Drive) "pd-balanced" (Balanced Persistent Disk) "pd-extreme" (Extreme Persistent Disk)
diskSizeGb
string ( int64 format)
Size in GB of the disk (default is 100GB).
NetworkSpec
JSON representation
{
"enableInternetAccess" : boolean ,
"network" : string ,
"subnetwork" : string
}
Fields
enableInternetAccess
boolean
Whether to enable public internet access. Default false.
network
string
The full name of the Google Compute Engine network
subnetwork
string
The name of the subnet that this instance is in. Format: projects/{project_id_or_number}/regions/{region}/subnetworks/{subnetwork_id}
Duration
JSON representation
{
"seconds" : string ,
"nanos" : integer
}
Fields
seconds
string ( int64 format)
Signed seconds of the span of time. Must be from -315,576,000,000 to +315,576,000,000 inclusive. Note: these bounds are computed from: 60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day * 365.25 days/year * 10000 years
nanos
integer
Signed fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution of the span of time. Durations less than one second are represented with a 0 seconds field and a positive or negative nanos field. For durations of one second or more, a non-zero value for the nanos field must be of the same sign as the seconds field. Must be from -999,999,999 to +999,999,999 inclusive.
LabelsEntry

RunResponse
JSON representation
{
"scheduledRunTime" : string ,
"runResponse" : string
}
Fields
scheduledRunTime
string ( Timestamp format)
The scheduled run time based on the user-specified schedule.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
runResponse
string
The response of the scheduled run.
