}
Fields
notebookRuntimeTemplate
string
Immutable. A resource name of the NotebookRuntimeTemplate.
Timestamp
JSON representation
{
"seconds" : string ,
"nanos" : integer
}
Fields
seconds
string ( int64 format)
Represents seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Must be between -62135596800 and 253402300799 inclusive (which corresponds to 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z).
nanos
integer
Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. This field is the nanosecond portion of the duration, not an alternative to seconds. Negative second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values that count forward in time. Must be between 0 and 999,999,999 inclusive.
LabelsEntry
JSON representation
{
"key" : string ,
"value" : string
}
Fields
key
string
value
string
MachineSpec
JSON representation
{
"machineType" : string ,
"acceleratorType" : enum ( AcceleratorType ) ,
"acceleratorCount" : integer ,
"gpuPartitionSize" : string ,
"tpuTopology" : string ,
"reservationAffinity" : {
object ( ReservationAffinity )
}
}
Fields
machineType
string
Immutable. The type of the machine.
See the list of machine types supported for prediction
See the list of machine types supported for custom training .
For DeployedModel this field is optional, and the default value is n1-standard-2 . For BatchPredictionJob or as part of WorkerPoolSpec this field is required.
acceleratorType
enum ( AcceleratorType )
Immutable. The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached to the machine as per accelerator_count .
acceleratorCount
integer
The number of accelerators to attach to the machine.
For accelerator optimized machine types ( https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/accelerator-optimized-machines) , One may set the accelerator_count from 1 to N for machine with N GPUs. If accelerator_count is less than or equal to N / 2, Vertex will co-schedule the replicas of the model into the same VM to save cost.
For example, if the machine type is a3-highgpu-8g, which has 8 H100 GPUs, one can set accelerator_count to 1 to 8. If accelerator_count is 1, 2, 3, or 4, Vertex will co-schedule 8, 4, 2, or 2 replicas of the model into the same VM to save cost.
When co-scheduling, CPU, memory and storage on the VM will be distributed to replicas on the VM. For example, one can expect a co-scheduled replica requesting 2 GPUs out of a 8-GPU VM will receive 25% of the CPU, memory and storage of the VM.
Note that the feature is not compatible with [multihost_gpu_node_count][]. When multihost_gpu_node_count is set, the co-scheduling will not be enabled.
gpuPartitionSize
string
Optional. Immutable. The Nvidia GPU partition size.
When specified, the requested accelerators will be partitioned into smaller GPU partitions. For example, if the request is for 8 units of NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and gpu_partition_size="1g.10gb", the service will create 8 * 7 = 56 partitioned MIG instances.
The partition size must be a value supported by the requested accelerator. Refer to Nvidia GPU Partitioning for the available partition sizes.
If set, the accelerator_count should be set to 1.
tpuTopology
string
Immutable. The topology of the TPUs. Corresponds to the TPU topologies available from GKE. (Example: tpu_topology: "2x2x1").
reservationAffinity

Output only. Whether ActAs check is bypassed for service account attached to the VM. If false, we need ActAs check for the default Compute Engine Service account. When a Runtime is created, a VM is allocated using Default Compute Engine Service Account. Any user requesting to use this Runtime requires Service Account User (ActAs) permission over this SA. If true, Runtime owner is using EUC and does not require the above permission as VM no longer use default Compute Engine SA, but a P4SA.
