Tool: colab_enterprise_delete_notebook_runtime
Deletes a Colab Enterprise runtime. Use this tool to permanently remove a runtime and its resources.
The following sample demonstrate how to use curl to invoke the colab_enterprise_delete_notebook_runtime MCP tool.
Curl Request
curl --location 'https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/mcp/generate' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
--data '{
"method": "tools/call",
"params": {
"name": "colab_enterprise_delete_notebook_runtime",
"arguments": {
// provide these details according to the tool' s MCP specification
}
} ,
"jsonrpc" : "2.0" ,
"id" : 1
} '
Input Schema
Request message for NotebookService.DeleteNotebookRuntime .
DeleteNotebookRuntimeRequest
JSON representation
{
"name" : string
}
Fields
name
string
Required. The name of the NotebookRuntime resource to be deleted. Instead of checking whether the name is in valid NotebookRuntime resource name format, directly throw NotFound exception if there is no such NotebookRuntime in spanner.
Output Schema
This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
Operation
JSON representation
{
"name" : string ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
} ,
"done" : boolean ,
// Union field result can be only one of the following:
"error" : {
object ( Status )
} ,
"response" : {
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
}
// End of list of possible types for union field result .
}
Fields
name
string
The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should be a resource name ending with operations/{unique_id} .
metadata
object
Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
done
boolean
If the value is false , it means the operation is still in progress. If true , the operation is completed, and either error or response is available.
Union field result . The operation result, which can be either an error or a valid response . If done == false , neither error nor response is set. If done == true , exactly one of error or response can be set. Some services might not provide the result. result can be only one of the following:
error
object ( Status )
The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
response
object
The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete , the response is google.protobuf.Empty . If the original method is standard Get / Create / Update , the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse , where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot() , the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse .
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
Any
JSON representation
{
"typeUrl" : string ,
"value" : string
}
Fields
typeUrl
string
Identifies the type of the serialized Protobuf message with a URI reference consisting of a prefix ending in a slash and the fully-qualified type name.
Example: type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValue
This string must contain at least one / character, and the content after the last / must be the fully-qualified name of the type in canonical form, without a leading dot. Do not write a scheme on these URI references so that clients do not attempt to contact them.
The prefix is arbitrary and Protobuf implementations are expected to simply strip off everything up to and including the last / to identify the type. type.googleapis.com/ is a common default prefix that some legacy implementations require. This prefix does not indicate the origin of the type, and URIs containing it are not expected to respond to any requests.
All type URL strings must be legal URI references with the additional restriction (for the text format) that the content of the reference must consist only of alphanumeric characters, percent-encoded escapes, and characters in the following set (not including the outer backticks): /-.~_!$&()*+,;= . Despite our allowing percent encodings, implementations should not unescape them to prevent confusion with existing parsers. For example, type.googleapis.com%2FFoo should be rejected.
In the original design of Any , the possibility of launching a type resolution service at these type URLs was considered but Protobuf never implemented one and considers contacting these URLs to be problematic and a potential security issue. Do not attempt to contact type URLs.
value
string ( bytes format)
Holds a Protobuf serialization of the type described by type_url.
A base64-encoded string.
Status
JSON representation
{
"code" : integer ,
"message" : string ,
"details" : [
{
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
}
]
}
Fields
code
integer
The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code .
message
string
A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
details[]
object
A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
