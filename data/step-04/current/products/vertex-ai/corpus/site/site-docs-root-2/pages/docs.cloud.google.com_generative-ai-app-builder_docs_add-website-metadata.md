Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
If advanced website indexing is enabled in your data store, you can use the
following types of structured data to enrich your indexing:
Predefined, Google-inferred page dates
Custom structured data attributes
Metadata using meta tags
PageMaps
Schema.org data
This page introduces both these types of structured data for your web pages
and describes how to add custom structured attributes to your data store schema.
About predefined, Google-inferred page dates
When crawling through the web pages in your website data store, Google infers
page data using the properties that apply to your content.
Vertex AI Search adds these inferred page data properties to your
schema. This inferred data
includes the following predefined date properties, which are also called
byline dates :
datePublished : the date and time when the page was first published
dateModified : the date and time when the page was most recently modified
These properties are indexed automatically. You can directly use these date
properties to enrich your search without adding them to your schema.
To add byline dates to your website, see
Influence your byline dates in Google Search .
To understand how to include these predefined date properties in your search
requests, such as in filter expressions and boost specifications, see
Example use case using a Google-inferred page date .
About custom datetime fields on a web page
You can add custom datetime fields to your web pages. Such tags can be used with
advanced indexing when you
add custom structured data attributes to the data store schema .
Here's an example that shows where to add
a custom datetime meta tag named lastModified on your web page.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Your web page title</title>
<!-- Vertex AI Search can use this date. -->
<meta name="lastModified" content="2022-07-01">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
To understand how to include such custom datetime tags in your search
requests, such as in filter expressions and boost specifications, see
Example use case using a custom datetime attribute .
About custom structured data attributes
You can add structured data attributes as meta tags and PageMaps to your web
pages and use these to enrich your indexing. To use custom structured attributes
for indexing, you must update your schema.
Example use case for meta tags
Suppose you have a large number of web pages that are relevant to various
departments in your organization. You can use meta tags to label the pages
that are relevant for each department. You can then use the indexed tags as
filters in your queries. This lets you to restrict search results to web pages
containing a label that matches any of the specified departments.
This process can be summarized as follows:
Add the following meta tags to a subset of your web pages:
Relevant to engineering and IT departments:
<meta name = "department" content = "eng, infotech" >
<meta property = "og:title" content = "Password best practices" >
Relevant to finance and HR departments:
<meta name = "department" content = "finance, human resources" >
<meta property = "og:image" content = "https://example.com/images/team-training-contractors.jpg" >
For a more elaborate example, see Example meta tags on a web page .
Recrawl the updated pages.
Add department to your data store schema as an indexable array as described
in the Add custom structured data attributes to the data store schema section.
After updating your schema, your data store is automatically reindexed.
After the reindexing is complete, you can use the department filter in a
filter expression to reorder or filter search
results. For example, when users from the finance department issue queries,
the search results can be made more relevant for them with the department
filter set to finance .
Example meta tags on a web page
Here's an example of the meta tags that you can add to
your web page. Such tags can be used with advanced indexing
when you
add custom structured data attributes to the data store schema .
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Your web page title</title>
<!-- Robots instructions for crawlers and for Vertex AI Search. -->
<meta name="robots" content="index,follow">
<!-- Vertex AI Search can use custom datetime fields to filter, boost, and order. -->
<meta name="lastModified" content="2024-09-06">
<!-- Vertex AI Search can filter by category or tags. -->
<meta name="category" content="archived">
<meta name="tags" content="legacy,interesting,faq">
<!-- Vertex AI Search can index these common HTML tags. -->
<meta name="description" content="A description of your web page's content.">
<meta name="author" content="Your name or organization">
<meta name="keywords" content="relevant,keywords,separated,by,commas">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.yourwebsite.com/this-page">
<meta property="og:title" content="Your Webpage Title">
<meta property="og:description" content="A description of your webpage's content.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://www.yourwebsite.com/image.jpg">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.yourwebsite.com/this-page">
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Your customized Webpage Title">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="A description of your webpage's content.">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://www.yourwebsite.com/image.jpg">
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
Example use case for PageMaps
Suppose you have several web pages that contain food recipes. You can add
PageMap data to each page's HTML content. You can then use the indexed PageMap
attribute names as filters in your queries. For example, if you intend to boost
or bury web pages depending on the recipe ratings, you can follow this process:
Add PageMap data similar to the following to your web pages:
<html>
<head>
...
<!--
<PageMap>
<DataObject type="document">
<Attribute name="title">Baked potatoes</Attribute>
<Attribute name="author">Dana A.</Attribute>
<Attribute name="description">Homestyle baked potatoes in oven. This
recipe uses Russet potatoes.</Attribute>
<Attribute name="rating">4.9</Attribute>
<Attribute name="lastUpdate">2015-01-01</Attribute>
</DataObject>
</PageMap>
-->
</head>
...
</html>
Recrawl the updated pages.
Add rating to your data store schema as an indexable array as described
in the
Add custom structured data attributes to the data store schema
section.
After updating your schema, your data store is automatically reindexed.
After the reindexing is complete, you can use the rating attribute in a
filter expression to reorder or filter search
results. For example, when users search for recipes, boost the search
results that are top-rated by using rating as a custom numerical
attribute .
Example use case for schema.org data
Suppose you have a review website and its web pages are annotated with
schema.org data in JSON-LD format within the HTML script tag. You can then use
the indexed annotations as filters in your queries. For example, if you intend
to boost or bury web pages depending on the aggregate ratings, you can follow
this process:
Add the schema.org annotations for review content similar to
the following to your web pages. To view other types of schema.org templates
that are available, see Schemas :
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "Review",
"aggregateRating": {
"@type": "Average Rating",
"ratingValue": 3.5,
"reviewCount": 11
},
"description": "Published in 1843, this is the perfect depiction of the Victorian London. A Christmas Carol is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge's transformation.",
"name": "A Christmas Carol",
"image": "christmas-carol-first-ed.jpg",
"review": [
{
"@type": "Review",
"author": "Alex T.",
"datePublished": "2000-01-01",
"reviewBody": "Read this in middle school and have loved this ever since.",
"name": "Worth all the adaptations",
"reviewRating": {
"@type": "Rating",
"bestRating": 5,
"ratingValue": 5,
"worstRating": 1
}
}
]
}
</script>
Recrawl the updated pages.
Add the path to ratingValue to your data store schema. Use an identifier
as the field name in the data store schema, such as rating_value as
described in the
Add custom structured data attributes to the data store schema
section.
After updating your schema, your data store is automatically reindexed.
After the reindexing is complete, you can use the rating_value attribute in a
filter expression to reorder or filter search
results. For example, when users search for books, boost the search
results that are top-rated by using rating_value as a custom numerical
attribute .
Before you begin
Before you update the data store schema, do the following:
Turn on advanced website indexing for the data store. For more
information, see
Turn on advanced website indexing .
Understand how structured data works .
Understand how to use PageMaps . Review the list of
recognized DataObjects that can be added to PageMap
data.
Understand how to use meta tags . Ensure that you don't use
any excluded meta tag names or
unsupported meta tags . However, if you already have
excluded meta tag names, see the siteSearchMetatagName
workaround .
Ensure that the attribute that needs to be indexed doesn't have any of the
following values:
datePublished
dateModified
siteSearch
Understand that after you add structured data to your web pages, you must
recrawl the pages. This might take several hours.
Understand that after you add structured data attributes to the data store
schema, the web pages in your data store are reindexed automatically.
Reindexing is a long-running operation that might take several hours.
Add custom structured data attributes to the data store schema
To add custom structured data attributes to the data store schema:
Add meta tags, PageMap data, and schema.org data to the pages in your
website that you want to enrich with structured data indexing:
For meta tags:
Each meta tag must have its name attribute set to the field you
want to index and its content attribute to a string of one or
more comma-separated values.
Vertex AI Search supports meta tags with names that
match the pattern [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]* . However, if you already
have meta tags with names that include other characters, see
the siteSearchMetatagName workaround .
Vertex AI Search doesn't support the use of any
excluded meta tag names or
unsupported meta tags . However, if you already
have excluded meta tag names, see
the siteSearchMetatagName workaround .
For PageMap data:
PageMap data must consist of
recognized DataObjects that contain Attribute
names that you want to index. The Attribute names within the
DataObjects must be set to the field you want to index.
For schema.org data:
The annotations must be in valid JSON-LD, Microdata, or RDFa format.
For more information, see Supported formats .
Recrawl the updated web pages.
View the schema definition for your data store over REST API.
Update the data store schema using Google Cloud console
or the API. If you choose to do it over the API, learn how to
provide your own schema as a JSON object .
Add objects for each custom attribute that you want to make searchable,
retrievable, or indexable.
Add the custom attribute and set its type to array .
Add the data type of the custom attribute's value.
Specify the source of the custom attribute where it can be found in the
siteSearchStructuredDataSources field.
For schema.org data: Specify the path of the attribute in the schema.org
annotation starting with string _root in the siteSearchSchemaOrgPaths
field.
The following is an example of a schema update for a website:
{
"type" : "object" ,
"properties" : {
" CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE " : {
"type" : "array" ,
"items" : {
"type" : " DATA_TYPE " ,
"searchable" : true ,
"retrievable" : true ,
"indexable" : true ,
"siteSearchMetatagName" : " METATAG_NAME " ,
"siteSearchStructuredDataSources" : [ " STRUCTURED_DATA_SOURCE_1 " , " STRUCTURED_DATA_SOURCE_2 " ]
}
},
" IDENTIFIER_FOR_SCHEMA_ORG_FIELD " : {
"type" : "array" ,
"items" : {
"type" : " DATA_TYPE_SCHEMA_ORG_FIELD " ,
"searchable" : true ,
"retrievable" : true ,
"indexable" : true ,
"siteSearchSchemaOrgPaths" : [ "_root. PATH_TO_THE_SCHEMA_ORG_FIELD " ]
}
}
},
"$schema" : "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
}
Replace the following:
CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE : the value of the name attribute.
For example:
For a meta tag defined as <meta name="department" content="eng, infotech"> ,
use department
For a PageMap Attribute defined as <Attribute name="rating">4.9</Attribute> ,
use rating
DATA_TYPE : the data type of the name
attribute. Must be either string, number, or datetime. For example:
For a meta tag defined as
<meta name="department" content="eng, infotech"> ,
use string
For a PageMap Attribute defined as <Attribute name="rating">4.9</Attribute> ,
use number
For a PageMap Attribute defined as <Attribute name="lastPublished">2015-01-01</Attribute> ,
use datetime
For more information, see FieldType .
METATAG_NAME : The value for the
siteSearchMetatagName field, which lets you specify the exact
name of a meta tag from your web page.
You only need to use the
siteSearchMetatagName workaround in the following
scenarios:
The meta tag's name attribute contains special characters (such as
a colon) and doesn't match the required pattern for
CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE , which is
[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]* .
For example, if you have a tag <meta name="og:updated_time"> , then,
you can't use og:updated_time as a
CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE . Instead, you would use a
compliant identifier for CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE
(like og_updated_time ) and then, set the value of
siteSearchMetatagName to og:updated_time .
The meta tag's name attribute is an
excluded meta tag name .
For example, if you have a tag <meta name="description"> , then,
you can't use description as a
CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE . Instead, you would use a
compliant identifier for CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE
(like meta_tag_description ) and then, set the value of
siteSearchMetatagName to meta_tag_description .
When you use siteSearchMetatagName to update the schema, you must use the
v1alpha endpoint instead of the v1 endpoint to call the
schema method.
STRUCTURED_DATA_SOURCE_N : an array consisting of one
or both of the following structured data sources where the
CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE attribute can be found:
If the custom attribute can be found as a meta tag, specify METATAGS
If the custom attribute can be found as a PageMap attribute, specify PAGEMAP
If the custom attribute can be found as a schema.org data, specify SCHEMA_ORG
If the siteSearchStructuredDataSources field is absent or left empty, the
values from all three data sources are merged in an array.
IDENTIFIER_FOR_SCHEMA_ORG_FIELD : a custom
identifier to denote the schema.org field. It doesn't need to be exactly
same as the field name in the schema.org annotation on your web page.
For example, if the path of the field is _root.nutrition.calories , the
identifier can be calorific_value or nutrition_value .
DATA_TYPE_SCHEMA_ORG_FIELD : the data type of the
schema.org field. Must be string, number, or datetime. For example:
For a schema.org field defined as "calories":"240 calories",
use string
For a schema.org field defined as "calories": 240,
use number
For a schema.org field defined as "foundingDate": "1991-05-01",
use datetime
For more information, see FieldType .
PATH_TO_THE_SCHEMA_ORG_FIELD : the path to a single
field in the schema.org field that needs to be accessed. It is specified
using dot separators after each nested level. You must specify the
complete path needed to access the required field. For example, if a
field ratingValue is nested in the aggregateRating field, you can
specify the path as _root.aggregateRating.ratingValue .
After you update the website schema, the website is reindexed automatically.
This is a long-running operation that can take several hours.
What's next
Use the indexed metadata for the following:
Serving controls , such as boost, bury, and filter
Surfacing as facets in search results
Filter search results
Boost search results
