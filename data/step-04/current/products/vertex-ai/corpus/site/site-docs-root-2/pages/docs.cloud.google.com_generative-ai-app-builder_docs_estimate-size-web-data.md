Get an estimate of monthly storage costs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Advanced website indexing incurs monthly data
storage charges based on the size of the web data that you import into your data
store. To get an estimate of the size of your web data before importing it, you
can call the estimateDataSize method and specify the web
pages that you want to import. The estimateDataSize method is a long-running
operation that runs until the process for estimating
the data size is complete. This can take from a few minutes to over an hour,
depending on the number of web pages that you specify. After you have an
estimate of the size of your web data, you can get an estimate of your monthly
data storage costs using the Vertex AI Search pricing page (see the Data Index
pricing section) or the Google Cloud's pricing
calculator (search for Vertex AI Search).
Important: You are permitted to use the estimateDataSize method only on web
domains that your company owns or is authorized to utilize.
Before you begin
Determine the URL patterns for the websites that you intend to include (and
optionally exclude) when you import web data into your data store. You
specify these URL patterns when you call the estimateDataSize method.
Procedure
To get an estimate of the size of your web data, follow these steps:
Call the estimateDataSize method.
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth application-default print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global:estimateDataSize" \
-d '{
"website_data_source": {
"estimator_uri_patterns": {
provided_uri_pattern: " URI_PATTERN_TO_INCLUDE ",
exact_match: EXACT_MATCH_BOOLEAN
},
"estimator_uri_patterns": {
provided_uri_pattern: " URI_PATTERN_TO_EXCLUDE ",
exact_match: EXACT_MATCH_BOOLEAN ,
exclusive: EXCLUSIVE_BOOLEAN
}
}
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your project.
URI_PATTERN_TO_INCLUDE : the URL patterns for the websites that
you want to include in your data size estimate.
URI_PATTERN_TO_EXCLUDE : (Optional) The URL patterns for the
websites that you want to exclude from your data size estimate.
For URI_PATTERN_TO_INCLUDE and
URI_PATTERN_TO_EXCLUDE , you can use patterns similar to the
following:
Entire website: www.mysite.com
Parts of a website: www.mysite.com/faq
Entire domain: mysite.com or *.mysite.com
EXCLUSIVE_BOOLEAN : (Optional) If true , then the provided URI
pattern represents web pages that are excluded from your data size
estimate. The default is false , which means that the provided URI
pattern represents web pages that are included in your data size estimate.
EXACT_MATCH_BOOLEAN : (Optional) If true , then the provided
URI pattern represents a single web page, instead of the web page and all
of its children. The default is false , which means that the provided URI
pattern represents the web page and all of its children.
The output is similar to the following:
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/operations/estimate-data-size-01234567890123456789" ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1alpha.EstimateDataSizeMetadata"
}
}
This output includes the name field, which is the name of the long-running
operation. Save the name value to use in the following step.
Poll the operations.get method.
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth application-default print-access-token ) " \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/ OPERATION_NAME "
Replace OPERATION_NAME with the name value that you saved in the
previous step. You can also get the operation name by listing long-running
operations .
Evaluate each response.
If a response does not contain "done": true , then the process for
estimating the data size is not complete. Continue polling.
The output is similar to the following:
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/operations/estimate-data-size-01234567890123456789" ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1alpha.EstimateDataSizeMetadata" ,
"createTime" : "2025-10-29T21:59:59.976752Z"
}
}
If a response contains "done": true , then the process for estimating the
data size is complete. Save the DATA_SIZE_BYTES value from the
response to use in the following step.
The output is similar to the following:
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/operations/estimate-data-size-01234567890123456789" ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1alpha.EstimateDataSizeMetadata" ,
"createTime" : "2025-10-29T21:59:59.976752Z"
},
"done" : true ,
"response" : {
"@type" : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1alpha.EstimateDataSizeResponse" ,
"dataSizeBytes" : DATA_SIZE_BYTES ,
"documentCount" : DOCUMENT_COUNT
}
}
This output includes the following values:
DATA_SIZE_BYTES : the estimated size of your web data, in
bytes.
DOCUMENT_COUNT : the estimated number of web pages in your web
data.
Divide the DATA_SIZE_BYTES
value from the previous step by 1,000,000,000 to get gigabytes. Save this
value for the following step.
To get an estimate for your monthly data storage costs:
Go Google Cloud's pricing calculator .
Click Add to estimate .
Search for Vertex AI Search and then click the
Vertex AI Search box.
In the Data Index box, enter the estimated size of your web data, in
gigabytes, from the previous step.
See the Estimated cost box for your estimated data storage cost.
