Use a custom service account
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide describes how to configure Vertex AI to use a custom service
account in the following scenarios:
When you perform custom training ,
you can configure Vertex AI to use a custom service account in
the training container, whether it is a
prebuilt container or a custom
container .
When you deploy a custom-trained Model resource to an Endpoint
resource to serve online predictions, you can
configure Vertex AI to use a custom service account in the
container that serves predictions, whether it is a
prebuilt container or a custom
container .
When you create a Ray on Vertex AI
cluster , you can set a custom service account for
all nodes in the cluster.
When to use a custom service account
When Vertex AI runs, it generally acts with the permissions of one
of several service accounts that Google creates
and manages for your Google Cloud project. To
grant Vertex AI increased access to other Google Cloud
services in certain contexts, you can add specific roles to
Vertex AI's service
agents .
However, customizing the permissions of service agents might not provide the
fine-grained access control that you want. Some common use cases include:
Allowing fewer permissions to Vertex AI jobs and models.
The default Vertex AI service agent has access to BigQuery
and Cloud Storage.
Allowing different jobs access to different resources.
You might want to allow many users to launch jobs in a single project, but grant each
user's jobs access only to a certain BigQuery table or
Cloud Storage bucket.
For example, you might want to
individually customize every custom training
job that you run to have access to different
Google Cloud resources outside of your project.
Moreover, customizing the permissions of service agents does not change the
permissions available to a container that serves predictions from a
custom-trained Model .
To customize access each time you perform custom training or to customize the
permissions of a custom-trained Model 's prediction container, you must use
a custom service account.
Default access
This section describes the default access available to custom training
containers and the prediction containers of custom-trained Model resources.
When you use a custom service account, you override this access for a specific
CustomJob , HyperparameterTuningJob , TrainingPipeline , or DeployedModel
resource.
Training containers
When you create a CustomJob , HyperparameterTuningJob , or a custom
TrainingPipeline , the training
container runs using your
Google Cloud project's Vertex AI Custom Code Service Agent by default.
Learn more about the
Vertex AI Custom Code Service Agent , including how to
give it access to additional Google Cloud resources.
Prediction containers
When you deploy a custom-trained Model to an Endpoint , the prediction
container runs using a service account managed by Vertex AI. This
service account is different from the Vertex AI service
agents .
The service account that the prediction container uses by default has permission
to read model artifacts
that Vertex AI makes available at a URI stored in the
AIP_STORAGE_URI environment
variable . Do not rely
on the service account to have any other permissions. You can't customize the
permissions of the service account.
Configure a custom service account
The following sections describe how to set up a custom service account to use
with Vertex AI and how to configure a CustomJob ,
HyperparameterTuningJob , TrainingPipeline , or DeployedModel to use the
service account. Note that you can't configure a custom service account to pull
images from Artifact Registry. Vertex AI uses the default service account to
pull images.
Set up a custom service account
To set up a custom service account, do the following:
Create a user-managed service
account. The
user-managed service account can be in the same project as your
Vertex AI resources or in a different project.
Grant your new service account IAM
roles that provide access to
the Google Cloud services and resources that you want
Vertex AI to be able to use during custom training or
prediction.
Optional : If the user-managed service account is in a different project
than your training jobs, you must grant the
Service Account Token Creator role
(roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator) to the Vertex AI Service Agent
of the project where you're using Vertex AI.
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
--role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator \
--member = serviceAccount: AI_PLATFORM_SERVICE_AGENT \
CUSTOM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
Optional : If you also plan to use the user-managed service account for
predictions, then you must grant the Service Account Admin role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin ) to the Vertex AI Service Agent of the project where
you're using Vertex AI:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
--role = roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin \
--member = serviceAccount: AI_PLATFORM_SERVICE_AGENT \
CUSTOM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
Replace the following:
AI_PLATFORM_SERVICE_AGENT : The email address of your project's
Vertex AI Service Agent, which has the following format:
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com
To find the Vertex AI Service Agent, go to the IAM page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to IAM
CUSTOM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT : The email address of the new
user-managed service account that
you created in the first step of this section.
Note: This command grants your project's Vertex AI Service Agent the
Service Account Admin role only for your custom service account resource,
not for the whole project. Learn more about granting permissions at the
resource level versus the project level .
Specify a custom service account for Vertex AI resources
The process of configuring Vertex AI to use a specific service
account for a resource is called attaching the service account to the
resource . The
following sections describe how to attach the service account that you created
in the previous section to several Vertex AI resources.
Note: To attach the service account, you must have the
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account. If you
successfully completed the previous section of this guide, then you likely
already have this permission. If you don't have the permission, ask a project
administrator to give you access by granting you the Service Account User role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) for the
custom service account.
Attach a service account to a custom training resource
To configure Vertex AI to use your new service account
during custom training, specify the service account's email address in the
serviceAccount field of a CustomJobSpec message
when you start custom training. Depending on which type of custom training
resource you are creating, the placement
of this field in your API request differs:
If you are creating a CustomJob , specify the service account's email
address in CustomJob.jobSpec.serviceAccount .
Learn more about creating a CustomJob .
If you are creating a HyperparameterTuningJob , specify the service
account's email address in
HyperparameterTuningJob.trialJobSpec.serviceAccount .
Learn more about creating a
HyperparameterTuningJob .
If you are creating a custom TrainingPipeline without hyperparameter
tuning , specify the service account's email address in
TrainingPipeline.trainingTaskInputs.serviceAccount .
If you are creating a custom TrainingPipeline with hyperparameter
tuning , specify the service account's email address in
TrainingPipeline.trainingTaskInputs.trialJobSpec.serviceAccount .
Attach a service account to a container that serves online predictions
To configure a custom-trained Model 's prediction container to use your new
service account , specify the service account's email address when you
deploy the Model to an Endpoint :
Console
Follow Deploying a model using the
Google Cloud console . When you specify
model settings, select the service account in the Service
account drop-down list.
gcloud
Follow Deploying a model using the
Vertex AI API . When you run the gcloud
ai endpoints deploy-model command, use the --service-account flag to
specify your service account's email address.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
ENDPOINT_ID : The ID for the endpoint.
LOCATION_ID : The region where you are using Vertex AI.
MODEL_ID : The ID for the model to be deployed.
DEPLOYED_MODEL_NAME : A name for the DeployedModel . You can use the display name of the
Model for the DeployedModel as well.
MACHINE_TYPE : Optional. The machine resources used for each node of this
deployment. Its default setting is n1-standard-2 .
Learn more about machine types.
MIN_REPLICA_COUNT : The minimum number of nodes for this deployment.
The node count can be increased or decreased as required by the inference load,
up to the maximum number of nodes and never fewer than this number of nodes.
MAX_REPLICA_COUNT : The maximum number of nodes for this deployment.
The node count can be increased or decreased as required by the inference load,
up to this number of nodes and never fewer than the minimum number of nodes.
CUSTOM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT : The service account's email
address. For example:
SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Execute the
gcloud ai endpoints deploy-model
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud ai endpoints deploy-model ENDPOINT_ID \
--region = LOCATION \
--model = MODEL_ID \
--display-name = DEPLOYED_MODEL_NAME \

API
Follow Deploying a model using the
Vertex AI API . When you send the
projects.locations.endpoints.deployModel
request , set the
deployedModel.serviceAccount
field
to the service account's email address.
Access Google Cloud services in your code
If you configure Vertex AI to use a custom service account by
following the instructions in preceding sections, then your training container
or your prediction container can access any Google Cloud services and
resources that the service account has access to.
To access Google Cloud services, write your training
code or your prediction-serving
code to use Application Default
Credentials (ADC) and explicitly
specify the project ID or project number of the resource you want to access.
Learn more about writing your code to access other Google Cloud
services .
Limitations
Custom service accounts in Vertex AI have the following limitations:
For batch inference, the Vertex AI service agent will still be used
to access BigQuery and Cloud Storage even when a custom service
account is configured.
There is a maximum of 20 custom service accounts per project per region per
service (for example, Vertex AI Inference).
