Configure feature-based explanations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Caution: Vertex Explainable AI is deprecated as of March 16, 2026. Access to Vertex Explainable AI will no
longer be available on or after March 16, 2027. For more information, see the
deprecations page.
To use Vertex Explainable AI with a custom-trained model, you must configure certain
options when you create the Model resource that you plan to request
explanations from, when you deploy the model, or when you submit a batch
explanation job. This page describes configuring these options.
If you want to use Vertex Explainable AI with an AutoML tabular model,
then you don't need to perform any configuration; Vertex AI
automatically configures the model for Vertex Explainable AI. Skip this document and read
Getting explanations .
When and where to configure explanations
You configure explanations when you create or import a model. You can also
configure explanations on a model that you have already created, even if
you didn't configuring explanations previously.
Configure explanations when creating or importing models
When you create or import a Model , you can set a default configuration for all
its explanations using the Model 's explanationSpec
field .
You can create a custom-trained Model in Vertex AI in the
following ways:
Import or register a Model to the Vertex AI Model Registry
Create a custom TrainingPipeline resource that imports a Model .
Create a BigQuery ML model and specify
the optional model_registry setting in the CREATE MODEL syntax. This
setting automatically registers the model to Vertex AI Model Registry
and configures its explanationSpec .
In either case, you can configure the Model to support Vertex Explainable AI. The
examples in this document assume that you are importing
a Model . To configure Vertex Explainable AI when you create a custom-trained Model
using a TrainingPipeline , use the configuration settings described in this
document in the TrainingPipeline 's modelToUpload
field .
Configure explanations when deploying models or getting batch inferences
When you
deploy a Model to an Endpoint resource , you
can either:
Configure explanations , whether or not the model was previously
configured for explanations. This is useful if you didn't originally plan to
get explanations (and omitted the explanationSpec field when you created
the model), but decide later that you want explanations for the Model, or if
you want to override some of the explanation settings.
Disable explanations . This is useful if your model is configured for
explanations, but you don't plan to get explanations from the endpoint. To
disable explanations when deploying the model to an endpoint, either clear
the Explainability options in the Cloud Console or set
DeployedModel.disableExplanations
to true .
Similarly, when you get batch inferences from a
Model , you can either
configure explanations by populating the BatchPredictionJob.explanationSpec
field
or disable explanations by setting BatchPredictionJob.generateExplanation to
false .
Override the configuration when getting online explanations
Regardless of whether you created or imported the Model with explanation
settings, and regardless of whether you configured explanation settings during
deployment, you can override the Model 's initial explanation settings when you
get online explanations .
When you send an explain request to
Vertex AI, you can override some of the explanation configuration
that you previously set for the Model or the DeployedModel .
In the explain request, you can override the following fields:
Input baselines for any
custom-trained model
Visualization configuration for image models
ExplanationParameters
except for the method
Override these settings in the explanation request's
explanationSpecOverride field .
Import a model with an explanationSpec field
Depending on whether you serve inferences using a prebuilt
container or a custom
container , specify slightly
different details for the ExplanationSpec . Select the tab that matches the
container that you are using:
TensorFlow prebuilt container
You can use any of the following attribution methods for Vertex Explainable AI. Read the
comparison of feature attribution
methods to select the appropriate one for
your Model :
The following examples assume that your model accepts a single input
feature; this is often the case for sequential Keras models and many other
TensorFlow models.
Since the feature is a tensor of any shape, it can in fact encode many pieces
of information. When you
request explanations ,
Vertex Explainable AI provides attributions for each element of the tensor.
If your model accepts multiple named input tensors, then add corresponding
entries to the inputs metadata field.
For TensorFlow 2 models, ExplanationMetadata is optional. If
omitted, Vertex AI automatically infers the values from the model and
uses the tensor names as the feature names. This notebook
demonstrates how to import a model without ExplanationMetadata .
Sampled Shapley
Depending on which tool you want to use to create or import the Model , select
one of the following tabs:
Console
Follow the guide to importing a model using the Google Cloud console .
When you get to the Explainability step, do the following:
For your feature attribution method, select Sampled Shapely (for tabular
models) .
Set the path count to the number of feature
permutations to use
for the Sampled Shapley attribution method. This must be an integer in the range
[1, 50] .
A higher value might reduce
approximation error but is more
computationally intensive.
If you don't know what value to use, try 25 .
Configure each input feature in your model:
Note: For Tensorflow 2 models, input feature name is optional.
Fill in your input feature name.
Optionally, you can add one or more input
baselines . Otherwise,
Vertex Explainable AI chooses a default input baseline of all-zero values, which
is a black image for image data.
If you're importing a TensorFlow model, there are additional input fields:
Fill out the Input tensor name .
If applicable, fill in the Indices tensor name and/or the
Dense shape tensor name .
The Modality cannot be updated here. It is set automatically to
NUMERIC for tabular models, or IMAGE for image models.
If applicable, set the Encoding field. This defaults to IDENTITY
if not set.
If applicable, set the Group name field.
If you're importing a TensorFlow model, specify output fields:
Set the Output name of your feature.
Set the Output tensor name of your feature.
If applicable, set the Index display name mapping .
If applicable, set the Display name mapping key .
Click the Import button when you have finished configuring the
explainability settings.

scikit-learn and XGBoost prebuilt containers
If your Model accepts tabular data as input and serves predictions using a
pre-built scikit-learn or XGBoost container for
prediction , then you can configure it
to use the Sampled Shapley attribution
method for explanations.
The following examples assume that your model accepts a single 2-D matrix as
input; this is often the case for scikit-learn and XGBoost models.
When you
request explanations ,
Vertex Explainable AI provides attributions for each element of the input matrix.

For your feature attribution method, select Sampled Shapely (for tabular
models) .
Set the path count to the number of feature
permutations to use
for the Sampled Shapley attribution method. This must be an integer in the range
[1, 50] .
A higher value might reduce
approximation error but is more
computationally intensive.
If you don't know what value to use, try 25 .
Configure each input feature in your model:
Fill in your input feature name.
If your model artifacts do not include feature names, then Vertex AI
is unable to map the specified input feature names to the model. In that
case, you should provide only one input feature with any arbitrary,
user-friendly name, such as input_features . In the explanation
response, you will get an N dimensional list of attributions, where N is
the number of features in the model and the elements in the list appear
in the same order as the training dataset.
Optionally, you can add one or more input
baselines . Otherwise,
Vertex Explainable AI chooses a default input baseline of all-zero values, which
is a black image for image data.
Set the Output name of your feature.
Click the Import button when you have finished configuring the
explainability settings.
gcloud
Write the following
ExplanationMetadata to a
JSON file in your local environment. The filename does not matter, but for this
example call the file explanation-metadata.json :
explanation-metadata.json
{
"inputs" ; : {
&qu ot;FEATURE_NAME" : {
}
},
"out puts" : {
"OUTPUT_NAME" : {
}
}
}
Replace the following:
FEATURE_NAME : Any memorable name for your input feature.
OUTPUT_NAME : Any memorable name for the output of your model.
If you specify input
baselines , make sure they match
your model's input, usually a list of 2-D matrices. Otherwise, the default
value for the input baseline is a 0-value 2-D matrix of the input shape.

Custom container
If your Model accepts tabular data as input and serves predictions using a
custom container , then you can configure it
to use the Sampled Shapley attribution
method for explanations.
Note: The following instructions do not work if you are using any of
Vertex AI's pre-built containers for serving
predictions . You must use a custom
container image that is not managed by Vertex AI and that meets the
custom container requirements .
Custom prediction servers must accept and return batch inference.
Determining feature and output names
In the following steps, you must provide Vertex AI with the names
of the features that your Model expects as input. You must also specify the
key used for outputs in the Model 's predictions.
Determining feature names
If your Model expects each input
instance to
have certain top-level keys, then those keys are your feature names.
For example, consider a Model that expects each input instance to have the
following format:
{
"leng<th&qu>ot; : value ,
< &quo>t;w idth" : value
}
In this case, the feature names are length and width . Even if the values of
these fields contain nested lists or objects, length and width are the only
keys you need for the following steps. When you request
explanations , Vertex Explainable AI provides
attributions for each nested element of your features.
If your Model expects unkeyed input, then Vertex Explainable AI considers the Model
to have a single feature. You can use any memorable string for the feature name.
For example, consider a Model that expects each input instance to have the
following format:
[
< value > ,
< value >
]
In this case, provide Vertex Explainable AI with a single feature name of your choosing,
like dimensions .
Note: The following examples assume that your model has a single input feature.
If your model has multiple features, as described in this section, then add
corresponding entries to the inputs field.
Determining the output name
If your Model returns each online prediction
instance with
keyed output, then that key is your output name.
For example, consider a Model that returns each prediction in the following
format:
{
"scor<es&qu>ot; : value
}
In this case, the output name is scores . If the value of the scores field is
an array, then when you get explanations, Vertex Explainable AI returns feature
attributions for the element with the highest value in each prediction. To
configure Vertex Explainable AI to provide feature attributions for additional elements
of the output field, you can specify the topK or outputIndices fields of
ExplanationParameters .
However, the examples in this document do not demonstrate these options.
If your Model returns unkeyed predictions, then you can use any memorable
string for the output name. For example, this applies if your Model returns
an array or a scalar for each prediction.
Creating the Model
Depending on which tool you want to use to create or import the Model , select
one of the following tabs:
