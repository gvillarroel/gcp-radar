Create a feature
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can create a feature after you create a feature group and associate a
BigQuery table or BigQuery view with it .
You can create multiple features for a feature group and associate each feature
with a specific column in the BigQuery data source. For information
about how to use BigQuery, refer to the
BigQuery documentation .
For example, if the feature group featuregroup1 is associated with the
BigQuery table datasource_1 containing feature values in columns
fval1 and fval2 , then you can create feature feature_1 under
featuregroup1 and associate it with the feature values in column fval1 .
Similarly, you can create another feature named feature_2 and associate it
with the feature values in column fval2 .
A feature group must have a feature data source associated with it before you
can create features. If the feature group doesn't have an associated data source,
you must associate a BigQuery data source by
updating the feature group , before you
can create features within it.
To understand whether it's mandatory, optional, or inadvisable for you to register
your feature data using feature groups and features, see the following:
Why use feature groups and features?
When not to use feature groups and features.
Before you begin
Authenticate to
Vertex AI, unless you've done so already.
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
Python
To use the Python samples on this page in a local development environment, install and
initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with
your user credentials.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Set up authentication for a local development environment .
REST
To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the
credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using REST
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
Create a feature within a feature group
Use the following samples to create a feature within a feature group and
associate a column containing feature values from the BigQuery
data source registered for the feature group.
Console
Use the following instructions to add features to an existing feature group using the Google Cloud console.
In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go
to the Feature Store page.
Go to the Feature Store page
In the Feature groups section, click
more_vert in the
row corresponding to the feature group where you want to add a feature,
and then click Add features .
For each feature, enter a Feature name and click the corresponding BigQuery source column name in the list. To add more features, click Add another feature .
Click Create .
Python
To learn how to install or update the Vertex AI SDK for Python, see Install the Vertex AI SDK for Python .
For more information, see the
Python API reference documentation .
from google.cloud import aiplatform
from vertexai.resources.preview import feature_store
def create_feature_sample (
project : str ,
location : str ,
existing_feature_group_id : str ,
feature_id : str ,
version_column_name : str ,
):
aiplatform . init ( project = project , location = location )
feature_group = feature_store . FeatureGroup ( existing_feature_group_id )
feature = feature_group . create_feature (
name = feature_id , version_column_name = version_column_name
)
return feature
project : Your project ID.
location : Region where the feature group is located, such as us-central1 .
existing_feature_group_id : The name of the existing feature group where you want to create the feature.
version_column_name : Optional: The column from the BigQuery table or
view that you want to associate with the feature. If you don't specify this parameter, it's set
to FEATURE_NAME , by default.
feature_id : The name of the new feature you want to create
REST
To create a Feature resource, send a POST request by using the
features.create
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION_ID : Region where the feature group is located, such as us-central1 .
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
FEATUREGROUP_NAME : The name of the feature group where you want to create the feature.
FEATURE_NAME : The name of the new feature you want to create.
VERSION_COLUMN_NAME : Optional: The column from the BigQuery table or
view that you want to associate with the feature. If you don't specify this parameter, it's set
to FEATURE_NAME , by default.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https:// LOCATION_ID -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /featureGroups/ FEATUREGROUP_NAME /features?feature_id= FEATURE_NAME
Request JSON body:
{
"version_column_name": " VERSION_COLUMN_NAME "
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https:// LOCATION_ID -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /featureGroups/ FEATUREGROUP_NAME /features?feature_id= FEATURE_NAME "
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https:// LOCATION_ID -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /featureGroups/ FEATUREGROUP_NAME /features?feature_id= FEATURE_NAME " | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION_ID /featureGroups/ FEATUREGROUP_NAME /features/ FEATURE_NAME /operations/ OPERATION_ID ",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.UpdateFeatureOperationMetadata",
"genericMetadata": {

"updateTime": "2023-09-18T02:36:22.870679Z"
}
}
