Responsible AI and usage guidelines for Imagen
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Imagen on Vertex AI brings Google's state of the art generative AI capabilities
to application developers. As an early-stage technology, Imagen on Vertex AI's
evolving capabilities and uses create potential for misapplication, misuse, and
unintended or unforeseen consequences. For example, Imagen on Vertex AI could
generate output that you don't expect, such as images that are offensive,
insensitive, or contextually incorrect.
Given these risks and complexities,
Imagen on Vertex AI is designed with Google's AI Principles in mind.
However, it is important for developers to understand and test their models to
deploy them safely and responsibly. To aid developers, Imagen on Vertex AI has
built-in safety filters to help customers block potentially harmful outputs
within their use case. See the safety filters section
for more.
When Imagen on Vertex AI is integrated into a customer's unique use
case and context, additional responsible AI considerations and model limitations
may need to be considered. We encourage customers to use fairness,
interpretability, privacy, and security recommended practices .

Imagen usage guidelines
Read the following general product attributes and legal considerations before
you use Imagen on Vertex AI.
Image and text filters and outputs: Images (generated or uploaded)
through Imagen on Vertex AI are assessed against safety filters.
Imagen aims to filter out (generated or uploaded) that
violate our acceptable use policy (AUP) or additional Generative AI product
restrictions. In addition, our generative imagery models are intended to
generate original content and not replicate existing content. We've designed
our systems to limit the chances of this occurring, and we will continue to
improve how these systems function. Like all cloud service providers, Google
maintains an Acceptable Use Policy that prohibits customers from using our
services in ways that infringe third-party IP rights.
Configurable safety filter thresholds: Google blocks model responses
that exceed the designated confidence scores for certain safety attributes.
To request the ability to modify a safety threshold, contact your
Google Cloud account team.
Text addition supported on certain model versions:
Imagen does not support adding text to images (uploaded
or generated) using a text prompt when using the imagegeneration@004 or
lower model versions.
Report suspected abuse:
You can report suspected abuse of Imagen on Vertex AI or any generated output that
contains inappropriate material or inaccurate information using the
Report suspected abuse on Google Cloud form .
Trusted Tester Program opt-out : If you previously opted in to permit Google to use your data
to improve pre-GA AI/ML services as part of the Trusted Tester Program terms, you can opt out
using the
Trusted Tester Program - Opt Out Request form .
Safety filters
Text prompts provided as inputs and images (generated or uploaded) through
Imagen on Vertex AI are assessed against a list of safety filters, which
include 'harmful categories' (for example, violence , sexual , derogatory ,
and toxic ).
These safety filters aim to filter out (generated or uploaded) content that
violates our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) ,
Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy or our
AI Principles .
If the model responds to a request with an error message such as "The prompt
couldn't be submitted" or "it might violate our policies", then the input is
triggering a safety filter. If fewer images than requested are returned, then
some generated output are blocked for not meeting safety requirements.
You can choose how aggressively to filter sensitive content by adjusting the
safetySetting parameter.
Safety attributes
Safety attributes and safety filters don't have a one-to-one mapping
relationship. Safety attributes are the set of attributes that we return to user
when includeSafetyAttributes is set. Safety filters are the set of filters we
use to filter content. We don't filter on all safety attribute categories. For
example, for the safety attribute category "Health", we don't filter content
based on the health confidence score. Also, we don't expose the confidence
scores for some of our internal sensitive safety filters.
Configure safety filters
There are several safety filtering parameters you can use with the
image generation models. For example, you can let the model report safety filter
codes for blocked content, disable people or face generation, adjust the
sensitivity of content filtering, or return rounded safety scores of list of
safety attributes for input and output. For more technical information about individual fields, see the
image generation model API reference .
The response varies depending on which parameters you set; some parameters
affect the content produced, while others affect content filtering and how
filtering is reported to you. Additionally, the output format depends on if the
input data is filtered, or if the generated image output is filtered.
Parameters that filter content
The following optional parameters affect content filtering or how filtering is
reported to you:
safetySetting - Lets you set how aggressively to filter for
potentially sensitive output content.
includeRaiReason - Provides more verbose information on filtered output.
personGeneration - A setting that allows you more control over the
generation of people, faces, and children.
disablePersonFace - Deprecated. A choice to allow person and face
generation or not. Users should set personGeneration instead.
includeSafetyAttributes - Gives you full safety attribute information for
input text, input image (for editing), and all generated images. This
information includes safety category (for example, "Firearms & Weapons" ,
"Illicit Drugs" , or "Violence" ) and the confidence scores.
Filtered input
If your text input or input image (for editing) is filtered, you get a response
with a 400 error code. A request with RAI-filtered input returns this output
format if you set either includeRaiReason or includeSafetyAttributes .
Output depends on the model version you use. The following shows output when the
input is filtered for different model versions:
Model
{
"error" : {
"code" : 400 ,
"message" : "Image generation failed with the following error: The prompt could not be submitted. This prompt contains sensitive words that violate Google's Responsible AI practices. Try rephrasing the prompt. If you think this was an error, send feedback."

}
]
}
}
Filtered output
The contents of filtered output vary depending on the RAI parameter you set.
The following output examples show the result of using the includeRaiReason
and includeSafetyAttributes parameters.
Filtered output using includeRaiReason
If you don't add includeRaiReason or set includeRaiReason: false , your
response only includes generated image objects that aren't filtered. Any
filtered image objects are omitted from the "predictions": [] array. For
example, the following is a response to a request with "sampleCount": 4 , but
two of the images are filtered and consequently omitted:
{
"predictions" : [
{
"bytesBase64Encoded" : " /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABA[...]bdsdgD2PLbZQfW96HEFE/9k= " ,
"mimeType" : " image/png "
},
{
"mimeType" : " image/png " ,
"bytesBase64Encoded" : " /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABA[...]Ct+F+1SLLH/2+SJ4ZLdOvg//Z "
}
],
"deployedModelId" : " MODEL_ID "
}
If you set includeRaiReason: true and several output images are filtered, your
response includes generated image objects and raiFilteredReason objects for
any filtered output images. For example, the following is a response to a
request with "sampleCount": 4 and includeRaiReason: true , but two of the
images are filtered. Consequently, two objects include generated image
information and the other object includes an error message.
Model
{
"predictions" : [
{
"bytesBase64Encoded" : " /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABA[...]bdsdgD2PLbZQfW96HEFE/9k= " ,
"mimeType" : " image/png "
},
{
"mimeType" : " image/png " ,
"bytesBase64Encoded" : " /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABA[...]Ct+F+1SLLH/2+SJ4ZLdOvg//Z "
},
{
"raiFilteredReason" : "Your current safety filter threshold filtered out 2 generated images. You will not be charged for blocked images. Try rephrasing the prompt. If you think this was an error, send feedback."
},
],
"deployedModelId" : " MODEL_ID "
}

"raiFilteredReason" : " 56562880 "
}
],
"deployedModelId" : " MODEL_ID "
}
Filtered output using includeSafetyAttributes
If you set "includeSafetyAttributes": true , the response "predictions": []
array includes the RAI scores (rounded to one decimal place) of text safety
attributes of the positive prompt. The image safety
attributes are also added to each unfiltered output. If an output image is
filtered its safety attributes aren't returned. For example, the following is a
response to an unfiltered request, and one image is returned:
{
"predictions" : [
{
"bytesBase64Encoded" : " /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABA[...]bdsdgD2PLbZQfW96HEFE/9k= " ,
"mimeType" : " image/png " ,
"safetyAttributes" : {
"categories" : [
" Porn " ,
" Violence "
],
"scores" : [
0.1 ,
0.2
]
}
},
{
"contentType" : "Positive Prompt" ,
"safetyAttributes" : {
"categories" : [
"Death, Harm & Tragedy" ,
"Firearms & Weapons" ,

Safety filter code categories
Depending on the safety filters you configure, your output may contain a safety
reason code similar to the following:
{
"raiFilteredReason": " ERROR_MESSAGE . Support codes: 56562880""
}
The code listed corresponds to a specific harmful category. These code to
category mappings are as follows:

Limitations
The following limits apply to different tasks:
Image generation and editing limitations
Bias amplification : While Imagen on Vertex AI can generate high-quality
images, there may be potential biases in the generated content. Images
generated rely on the product's training data, which can unintentionally
include biases that may perpetuate stereotypes or discriminate against
certain groups. Careful monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure
the outputs align with Google's Acceptable Use Policy and your use case.
Transparency and disclosure : It can be difficult for users to
differentiate between AI generated Imagery and non AI generated imagery.
When using AI-generated images within your use case, it is important to
clearly disclose to users that the images have been generated by an AI
system to ensure transparency and maintain trust in the process. We've
applied metadata labeling to AI-generated images to help combat the risk of
misinformation and as part of our responsible approach to AI.
Insufficient context : Imagen on Vertex AI may lack the contextual
understanding required to generate images that are appropriate for all
situations or audiences within your use case. Be sure to check that your
generated images align with your chosen context, purpose, and intended
audience.
Misrepresentation and authenticity : Editing images using
Imagen on Vertex AI can result in misrepresentation or manipulation of
images, potentially leading to the creation of deceptive or misleading
content. It is important to ensure that the editing process is used
responsibly, without compromising the authenticity and truthfulness of the
images edited. We've applied metadata labeling to AI-edited images to help
combat the risk of misinformation and as part of our responsible approach to
AI.
Misrepresentation and authenticity : Be cautious when editing images of
adults or children, as editing images using Imagen on Vertex AI might result
in misrepresentation or manipulation of images. This can potentially lead to
the creation of deceptive or misleading content. It's important to ensure
that the editing process is used responsibly, without compromising the
authenticity and truthfulness of the images edited. We've applied metadata
labeling to AI-edited images to help combat the risk of misinformation and
as part of our responsible approach to AI.
Visual captioning limitations
Accuracy and context sensitivity : Visual captioning may encounter
challenges in accurately describing complex or ambiguous images. The
generated descriptions may not always capture the complete context or
nuances of the visual content. It is important to acknowledge that automated
captioning systems have limitations in understanding images with varying
levels of complexity, and their descriptions should be used with caution,
particularly in critical or sensitive contexts.
Ambiguity and subjective interpretations : Images can often be open to
multiple interpretations, and the generated captions may not always align
with human understanding or expectations. Different individuals may perceive
and describe images differently based on their subjective experiences and
cultural backgrounds. It is crucial to consider the potential for ambiguity
and subjectivity in image descriptions and provide additional context or
alternative interpretations where necessary.
Accessibility considerations : While automated image captions can support
accessibility by providing descriptions for visually impaired individuals,
it is important to recognize that they may not fully replace human-generated
alt-text or descriptions tailored to specific accessibility needs. Automated
captions may lack the level of detail or contextual understanding necessary
for certain accessibility use cases.
Visual Question Answering (VQA) limitations
Overconfidence and uncertainty : VQA models may sometimes provide answers
with unwarranted confidence, even when the correct answer is uncertain or
ambiguous. It is essential to communicate the model's uncertainty and
provide appropriate confidence scores or alternative answers when there is
ambiguity, rather than conveying a false sense of certainty.
Recommended practices
To utilize this technology safely and responsibly, it is also important to
consider other risks specific to your use case, users, and business context in
addition to built-in technical safeguards.
We recommend taking the following steps:
Assess your application's security risks.
Consider adjustments to mitigate safety risks.
Perform safety testing appropriate to your use case.
Solicit user feedback and monitor content.
