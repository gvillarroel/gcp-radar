Create a feature view instance
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can create a feature view within an existing online store instance. While
creating a feature view, you can associate features with it in the following
ways:
Add feature groups and features from Feature Registry : Associate with existing
feature groups and features from the Feature Registry. A feature
group specifies the location of the BigQuery data source. A feature
within the feature group points to a specific feature column within that data
source. You can associate a feature view with multiple feature groups.
Add features from a BigQuery source: Directly associate
a BigQuery data source, such as a BigQuery table or view,
and specify at least one entity ID column.
After you create a feature view, Vertex AI Feature Store syncs the
latest feature values from the BigQuery data source. If you set the
query parameter run_sync_immediately=true , then Vertex AI Feature Store
syncs the feature values when you create the feature view. Otherwise,
Vertex AI Feature Store syncs the feature values according to the
sync schedule specified for the feature view.
Before you begin
Authenticate to
Vertex AI, unless you've done so already.

Sync feature data in a feature view
Vertex AI Feature Store can refresh or sync the feature values from the
BigQuery data source to the feature view. You can specify the type of
data sync for a feature view by using the
FeatureView.sync_config
parameter.
Note: If your online store instance uses Bigtable online serving, the feature
records that you delete from the BigQuery source table
are retained in the corresponding feature views, even when you sync the data.
To delete those feature records, you must delete the feature view .
Vertex AI Feature Store supports the following types of data sync:
Scheduled data sync : You can specify the schedule or frequency for the
data sync. You can choose this scheduled data sync for a feature view,
regardless of the online serving type specified for the online store instance.
If your feature view is configured to use scheduled data sync, you can
optionally skip the wait until the next scheduled sync operation, by manually
initiating the data sync. For more information about manually triggering a data
sync, see Sync feature data to online store .
During online serving, if you want to serve only the latest feature values,
including null values, you must use the following setup:
Register your feature data source by creating a feature group
with the dense parameter set to true .
Choose Bigtable online serving when you create the online store instance .
Choose scheduled data sync when you create your feature views.
Continuous data sync : The feature data is refreshed whenever the feature
data in the BigQuery data source is updated. You can choose this type
of data sync for a feature view only if all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
The online store instance is configured for Bigtable online serving.
The feature view is associated with feature groups and feature resources.
The BigQuery data source is located in any of the following
regions:
eu
us
us-central1
Continuous data sync has the following limitations:
You can't update a feature view if you select continuous data sync for it.
Only new feature records are synced from the BigQuery
data source. Continuous data sync doesn't sync feature records that you
update or delete in BigQuery.
The feature group in the Feature Registry source must have
a BigQuery table as its source.
Optimize costs during scheduled data sync
A data sync operation might involve costs for BigQuery resource usage. Follow
these guidelines to optimize these costs and improve performance during a data
sync:
Don't configure the sync schedule to run more frequently than the frequency
at which the data is expected to change in the BigQuery source.
Optimize the size of the feature data source in BigQuery. While
creating the feature view, only include the data that you need for online
serving.
Avoid running complex aggregations in BigQuery. Run a SELECT *
query on the table or view to estimate the volume and duration of data
processing.
While setting the scaling options for the online store, set max_node_count
to a value that's high enough to cover high loads during a data sync.
Schedule the sync for different feature views at different times within the
same online store.
If your BigQuery table contains extensive historical data,
consider partitioning the table using timestamps and specify a time range for
retrieving the feature data. This minimizes the retrieval of obsolete feature
data during sync.
Bigtable utilization increases during data syncs. For feature views
created within online stores for Bigtable online serving, schedule sync jobs
during off-peak times for best performance.
Configure the service account for a feature view
Each feature view uses a service account to access the source data in
BigQuery during sync.
Vertex AI Feature Store assigns the
BigQuery Data Viewer
Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to this service account.
By default, a feature view uses the service account configured for your project.
With this configuration, any user with permission to create a feature view in
your project can access the feature data in BigQuery.
Alternatively, you can configure the feature view to use its own service
account. Vertex AI Feature Store then sets up a dedicated service
account for the feature view. With this configuration, you can restrict access
to feature data in BigQuery or grant access to additional users.
You can specify the service account configuration by using the
FeatureView.service_agent_type
parameter. Note that Vertex AI Feature Store generates a unique service
account email address for each feature view configured to have a dedicated
service account.
If a feature view is configured to have a dedicated service account, you can
view the service account email address in either of the following ways:
Retrieve a list of all feature views within the online store instance
by using the featureViews.list method.
Retrieve the details of the feature view by using the featureViews.get method.
Configure vector retrieval for a feature view
Vertex AI Feature Store Optimized online serving is
deprecated . Beginning on
May 17, 2026, no new features will be added and
only critical patches will be provided. On February 17, 2027, the capability will be fully
sunset and APIs will no longer be available.
To improve latency and cost optimizations, migrate to
Bigtable online serving .
To efficiently store and serve embeddings, use the purpose-built
Vector Search .
You can configure vector retrieval for a feature view within an online store
created for Optimized online serving by using the
FeatureView.index_config parameter.
For information about how to prepare or update the BigQuery data source to support embeddings
by including the embedding column, see Data source preparation guidelines .
Note that you can configure vector retrieval and manage embeddings only if the feature
view is created by specifying a BigQuery source URI and not from
feature groups and features from Feature Registry.
For more information about how to search for approximate nearest neighbors using
embeddings in Vertex AI Feature Store, see
Search using embeddings .
Create a feature view from feature groups
You can create a feature view based on feature data registered using feature
groups and features. To associate multiple BigQuery data sources
with the same feature view, you can specify multiple feature groups.
If you create a feature view by specifying feature groups and features:
Your data source must have a feature_timestamp column and can contain historical data.
Vertex AI Feature Store serves only the latest feature values
based on the feature timestamp.
You can't configure embedding management for the feature view.
Create a feature view with the default service account configuration
Use the following sample to create a feature view by associating multiple feature groups
without specifying a service account configuration.

Create a feature view from a BigQuery source
If you want to serve features online without registering your BigQuery
data source using feature groups and features, you can create a feature view by
specifying the URI of the BigQuery data source.
If you create a feature view by specifying the data source:
You can't include a feature_timestamp column in the BigQuery table or view.
You can't include historical feature values in the data source. Every row must
contain a unique entity ID.
Create a feature view that uses the default service account and doesn't support embeddings
Use the following samples to create a feature view that doesn't support embeddings,
by directly associating a BigQuery data source and without specifying a
service account configuration.

Create a feature view with a dedicated service account and without embedding management
Use the following sample to create a feature view without embedding support by
directly associating a BigQuery data source and specifying a service
account configuration.
REST
To create a FeatureView
resource with embeddings support, send a POST request by using the
featureViews.create
method and specifying the FeatureView.index_config
parameter. Note that you can use embedding management only if the online store is configured for Optimized online serving.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION_ID : Region where you want to create the feature view, such as us-central1 .
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
FEATUREONLINESTORE_NAME : The name of the online store instance where you want to create the feature view.
FEATUREVIEW_NAME : The name of the new feature view that you want to create.
PROJECT_NAME : Your project name.
DATASET_NAME : Your BigQuery dataset name.
TABLE_NAME : The name of the table from your BigQuery dataset.
ENTITY_ID_COLUMNS : The names of the column(s) containing the entity IDs. You can
specify either one column or multiple columns.
To specify only one entity ID column, specify the column name in the following format:
"entity_id_column_name"
To specify multiple entity ID columns, specify the column names in the following format:
["entity_id_column_1_name", "entity_id_column_2_name", ...]
CRON : Cron schedule expression representing the frequency for syncing data to the
feature view. For more information, see cron .
SERVICE_AGENT_TYPE : Service account configuration for the feature view. To use a
dedicated service account for the feature view, enter
SERVICE_AGENT_TYPE_FEATURE_VIEW .
