Control access to Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) resources
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) is
deprecated . Beginning on
May 17, 2026, no new features will be added and only critical
patches will be provided. On February 17, 2027, the service will be fully sunset and APIs will
no longer be available.
For continued support and faster innovation, migrate to
Vertex AI Feature Store (V2) ,
our integrated platform for machine learning (ML) feature management introduced on November 17,
2023.
You can control access to Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) resources by
setting IAM policies at different levels of the
resource hierarchy . For example:
A project-level policy IAM applies to all resources in a project.
You can set a project-level policy to grant permissions to users to
read all featurestores in your project.
A resource-level IAM policy
lets you specify which users can access specific resources. For a subset of users, you can set a
resource-level policy to grant write permissions to specific featurestores in
your project.
You can set resource-level Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies on the following
Vertex AI Feature Store (Legacy) resources:
Featurestore : When you set an Identity and Access Management policy on a featurestore,
the policy applies to the featurestore and all entity types created in that
featurestore.
Entity type : When you set an Identity and Access Management policy on an entity type, the policy
applies only to the entity type and the featurestore where the entity type
is created.
An IAM policy includes one or more role bindings that
define which IAM roles are associated with which principals. A
role is a collection of permissions that you grant to a principal.
Vertex AI provides predefined roles that you can use
in your policies. Or, you can create your own custom roles.
Considerations
You can't set conditional resource policies. For example, you can't create a
policy that grants access to any resource that has or will have a name starting
with a particular string like testing .
Sample use case
As an example, imagine your organization has two sets of users. One set manages
your core infrastructure in a DevOps administrator role. Another set manages particular entity
types and their features, such as a data engineer.
A DevOps administrator manages featurestores and entity types at the project level. When
data engineers request a new entity type, a DevOps admin can create and
delegate ownership of that entity type to the data engineers. Data engineers
can freely manage features in the entity types they own, but they can't operate
on the featurestore or other entity types. This control, for example, lets
DevOps admins limit access to entity types that contain sensitive information.
In this scenario, the DevOps administrator has the aiplatform.featurestoreAdmin role
at the project level. Then, when a data engineer requests a new entity type, the
administrator creates a new entity type and then assigns
the aiplatform.entityTypeOwner role to the data engineer at the entity type
level (as a resource-level policy).
Get IAM policy
You can view the current IAM policy on a featurestore or entity
type by using the Google Cloud console or API.
Web UI
In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to
the Features page.
Go to the
Features page
Select a region from the Region drop-down list.
In the features table, select a featurestore or an entity type from the
Featurestore or Entity type column.
Click Permissions .
To show resource-level permissions, turn off Show inherited
permissions .
Principals who have access to the selected resource are grouped by
role.
Expand a role to see which principals are assigned to that role.
REST
To get the IAM policy from a resource, send a POST request that
uses the getIamPolicy method. The following example gets an
entity type policy.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION_ID : Region where the featurestore is located, such as us-central1 .
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID .
FEATURESTORE_ID : ID of the featurestore.
ENTITY_TYPE_ID : ID of the entity type.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https:// LOCATION_ID -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /featurestores/ FEATURESTORE_ID /entityTypes/ ENTITY_TYPE_ID :getIamPolicy
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d "" \ "https:// LOCATION_ID -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /featurestores/ FEATURESTORE_ID /entityTypes/ ENTITY_TYPE_ID :getIamPolicy"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https:// LOCATION_ID -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /featurestores/ FEATURESTORE_ID /entityTypes/ ENTITY_TYPE_ID :getIamPolicy" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"version": 1,
"etag": "BwXTmICm7mI",
"bindings": [
{
"role": "roles/aiplatform.entityTypeOwner",
"members": [
"user:example@example.com"
]
}
]
}
Set an IAM policy
You can set an IAM policy on a featurestore or entity
type.
Web UI
In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go to
the Features page.
Go to the
Features page
Select a region from the Region drop-down list.
In the features table, select a featurestore or an entity type from the
Featurestore or Entity type column.
Click Permissions .
Click Add principal .
Specify a principal and one or more roles to associate with the
principal.
Click Save .
REST
To set the IAM policy on a resource, send a POST request that
uses the setIamPolicy method. The following example sets a
policy on an entity type.
Setting an IAM policy overrides any existing policy (changes are
not appended). If you want to modify a resource's existing policy, use the
getIamPolicy method to get its existing policy and then make
modifications. Include your modified policy along with the etag in
your setIamPolicy request.
If you receive a 409 error code, there was a concurrent SetIamPolicy request
that updated the policy. Make a GetIamPolicy to get the policy's updated etag,
and then retry the SetIamPolicy request by including the new etag.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION_ID : Region where the featurestore is located, such as us-central1 .
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID .
FEATURESTORE_ID : ID of the featurestore.
ENTITY_TYPE_ID : ID of the entity type.
ROLE : An IAM role that includes the permissions
to grant, such as roles/aiplatform.featurestoreDataViewer .
PRINCIPAL : The principal that is granted the role's
permissions, such as user:myuser@example.com .
ETAG : A string value that is used to prevent simultaneous
updates of a policy from overwriting each other. This value is returned as
part of the getIamPolicy response.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https:// LOCATION_ID -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /featurestores/ FEATURESTORE_ID /entityTypes/ ENTITY_TYPE_ID :setIamPolicy
Request JSON body:
{
"policy": {
"bindings": [
{
"role": " ROLE ",
"members": [
" PRINCIPAL "
]
},
...
],
"etag": " ETAG "
}
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https:// LOCATION_ID -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /featurestores/ FEATURESTORE_ID /entityTypes/ ENTITY_TYPE_ID :setIamPolicy"

Verify IAM permissions for a resource
You can verify whether the authenticated user has specific IAM permissions for a featurestore or entity
type.
REST
To verify whether a user has specific IAM permissions for a resource,
send a POST request that uses the testIamPermissions method.
The following example lets you test whether the currently authenticated user has a set of IAM
permissions for an entity type.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION_ID : Region where the featurestore is located, such as us-central1 .
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID .
FEATURESTORE_ID : ID of the featurestore.
ENTITY_TYPE_ID : ID of the entity type.
HTTP method and URL:
