Create a feature group
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A feature group
is a Feature Registry
resource that's associated with a BigQuery table or view containing
your feature data. A feature group can contain multiple
features , where
each feature is associated with a column in the feature data source. If you want
to register your feature data source in the Feature Registry, create a
feature group and then add features to it.
After you create a feature group and associate the BigQuery data
source, you can create features associated
with the columns in the data source. Note that although it's optional to
associate a data source while creating a feature group, you must associate
a BigQuery table or view before you create features within that
feature group. Each feature corresponds to a column in the data source
associated with the feature group.
Why use feature groups and features?
Registering your feature data source is optional. However, you must
register your feature data by creating feature groups and features
in the following scenarios:
Use historical data in time series format to train a model : If the feature
data source contains latest as well as historical feature data with multiple
feature records for the same entity ID, then format this data as a
time series by adding the feature_timestamp column. In this scenario, you
must register the data source using feature groups and features. You can then
serve features, as follows:
Use online serving to serve the
latest feature values based on the timestamp to make real-time predictions.
Use offline serving to serve
latest as well as historical feature values to train a model.
Aggregate features from multiple sources : Use feature groups to aggregate
specific columns from multiple BigQuery
data sources when you create a feature view instance .
Serve null feature values : During online serving, if you want to serve
only the latest feature values, including null values, then register your
featured data source by creating feature groups with the dense parameter set
to true .
Note: To serve null feature values, you must also use an online store
instance configured for Bigtable online serving and use scheduled data sync
in your feature views.
Use continuous data sync in your feature views : Registering your features
is a prerequisite for using continuous data sync in your feature
views.
Note: To use continuous data sync, you must also meet the following requirements:
The online store instance must be configured for
Bigtable online serving.
The associated BigQuery
data source must be located in eu , us , or us-central1 .
Monitor features for anomalies : You must register your features if you want to
set up feature monitoring to
retrieve feature statistics and detect feature drift.
When not to use feature groups and features
If you want to serve embeddings
from your feature data source, then don't register the data source by creating
feature groups and features. In this scenario, you must set up online serving by
directly associating the BigQuery table or view with your feature
views.
For more information about setting up online serving without registering your
feature data source, see
Create a feature view from a BigQuery source .
Control access
You can control access for a feature group at the following levels:
Control access to the FeatureGroup resource : To control access to a
feature group for a specific individual, Google group, domain, or service account,
set up an IAM policy for the feature group .
Control access to the BigQuery data source : By default, a
feature group uses the default service account configured for the project.
Vertex AI Feature Store assigns the
BigQuery Data Viewer
Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to this service account.
This lets any user with permission to create a feature group in the project
access the feature data source in BigQuery. To restrict access
to the BigQuery data source or to grant access to additional
users, you can set up your feature group to use its own dedicated service account.
Vertex AI Feature Store generates a unique service
account email address for each feature group configured to have a dedicated
service account.
Note: You can view the dedicated service account email address for a feature
group in one of the following ways: Retrieve a list of all
feature groups by using the featureGroups.list
method.
Retrieve the details of the feature group by using the featureGroups.get
method.
Before you begin
Before you create a feature group, complete the following prerequisites:
Ensure that there's at least one online store instance created in your project,
even if you want to create a new online store instance. If you're using a new
project, then create an online store instance
before you create the feature group.
Format your feature data in the BigQuery table or view to conform
to the Data source preparation guidelines .
Verify that your BigQuery data source contains at least
one entity ID column with string or int values.
Authenticate to
Vertex AI, unless you've done so already.
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
Python
To use the Python samples on this page in a local development environment, install and
initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with
your user credentials.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Set up authentication for a local development environment .
REST
To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the
credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using REST
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
Create a feature group to register a feature data source
Use the following samples to create a feature group and associate a
feature data source, such as a BigQuery table or view.
Console
Important: You can't create a feature group with a dedicated service account
from the Google Cloud console. To create a feature group with a dedicated
service account, use the REST API or the Vertex AI SDK for Python.
Use the following instructions to create a feature group using the Google Cloud console:
In the Vertex AI section of the Google Cloud console, go
to the Feature Store page.
Go to the Feature Store page
In the Feature groups section, click Create to open the Basic info pane on the Create Feature Group page.
Specify the Feature group name .
Optional: To add labels, click Add label , and specify the label name and value. You can add multiple labels to a feature group.
In the BigQuery path field, click Browse to select BigQuery source table or view to associate with the feature group.
In the Entity ID column list, select the entity ID columns
from the BigQuery source table or view.
Note that this is optional if the BigQuery source table or view
has a column named entity_id . In that case, if you don't select an entity
ID column, the feature group uses the entity_id column as the default
entity ID column.
Click Continue .
In the Register pane, click one of the following options to indicate whether you want to add features to the new feature group:
Include all columns from the BigQuery table —Create features within the feature group for all the columns in the BigQuery source table or view.
Manually enter your features —Create features based on specific columns in the BigQuery source. For each feature, enter a Feature name and click the corresponding BigQuery source column name in the list.
To add more features, click Add another feature .
Create an empty feature group —Create the feature group without adding features to it.
Click Create .

REST
To create a FeatureGroup
resource, send a POST request by using the
featureGroups.create
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION_ID : Region where you want to create the feature group, such as us-central1 .
SERVICE_AGENT_TYPE : Optional. Service account configuration for the feature group. To use a
dedicated service account for the feature group, enter SERVICE_AGENT_TYPE_FEATURE_GROUP .
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
ENTITY_ID_COLUMNS : The names of the column(s) containing the entity IDs. You can
specify either one column or multiple columns.
To specify only one entity ID column, specify the column name in the following format:
"entity_id_column_name" .
To specify multiple entity ID columns, specify the column names in the following format:
["entity_id_column_1_name", "entity_id_column_2_name", ...] .
FEATUREGROUP_NAME : The name of the new feature group that you want to create.
BIGQUERY_SOURCE_URI : URI of the BigQuery source table or view that you want to register for the feature group.
TIMESTAMP_COLUMN : Optional. Specify the name of the column containing the feature timestamps
in the BigQuery source table or view. You need to specify the timestamp column
name only if the data is formatted as a time series and the column containing the
feature timestamps isn't named feature_timestamp .
Caution : Don't include the time_series parameter if
you set the static_data_source parameter to true .
STATIC_DATA_SOURCE : Optional. Enter true if the data isn't formatted
as a time series. The default setting is false .
Caution : Don't include static_data_source parameter if you use the
time_series parameter.
DENSE : Optional. Indicate how Vertex AI Feature Store
handles null values while serving data from feature views associated with the feature group:
false —This is the default setting. Vertex AI Feature Store
serves only the latest non-null feature values. If the latest value for a feature is
null, Vertex AI Feature Store serves the most recent non-null historical
value. However, if the current as well as historical values for that feature are null,
then Vertex AI Feature Store serves null as the feature value.
true —For feature views with scheduled data sync,
Vertex AI Feature Store serves only the latest feature values, including null
values. For feature views with continuous data sync, Vertex AI Feature Store
serves only the latest non-null feature values. However, if the current as well as historical
values for the feature are null, then Vertex AI Feature Store serves null as the
feature value. For more information about data sync types and how to configure the type of
data sync in a feature view, see
