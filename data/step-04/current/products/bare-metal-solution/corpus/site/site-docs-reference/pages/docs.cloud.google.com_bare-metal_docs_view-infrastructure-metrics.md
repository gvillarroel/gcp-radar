View Bare Metal Solution metrics
This page describes how to access and view Bare Metal Solution metrics.
Bare Metal Solution collects metrics at regular intervals and makes them available for
analysis. You can use these metrics to analyze the performance of your
Bare Metal Solution infrastructure and troubleshoot issues.
Google Cloud console provides a predefined dashboard using which you can monitor
your Bare Metal Solution servers and volumes.
Note: Bare Metal Solution metrics data is available at a low granularity and
might include gaps. Metrics are sampled every 5 minutes. After sampling, the
data is not visible for up to 30 minutes. Also, for this reason, we don't
recommend creating alerts for the metrics.
Before you begin
Optional: Set up Ops Agent to
gather more detailed data from your Bare Metal Solution servers.
View server metrics
Bare Metal Solution collects server metrics at the network switch level.
All servers have the following basic metrics available:
Network traffic totals
Network traffic logical interface
The following additional insights are available upon installing the Ops Agent:
CPU utilization
Memory utilization
Disk space utilization
Disk throughput
To view metrics for your server, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Compute Engine > Bare Metal Solution > Servers page.
Click the name of the server.
Click the Observability tab.
From the Chart menu, select the chart for the metric that you want to
view.
The following charts are available:
Metric
Description
Network traffic totals
The rate of network data sent and received by the server.
Network traffic logical interface
The rate of network data sent and received by each logical interface
of the server.
If you've set up Ops Agent on your server, the following charts are also
available:
Metric
Description
CPU utilization
CPU Usage is the time-weighted average number of CPUs that were
utilized on the machine over a given minute.
Memory utilization
Percent of memory used by this server, excluding disk caches. For
Linux VMs, this also excludes kernel memory and so is usage by user
space only.
Disk utilization
Disk space used in percent per the OS disk device.
Disk throughput
The average rate of bytes written to and read from the OS disk
devices. This doesn't include network storage.
Select the interval from the interval picker to display data for the
chosen timeframe.
By default, the data is displayed for the last 6 hours. You can
choose intervals ranging from 1 hour to 30 days.
You can also set a custom interval by following these steps:
In the interval picker, click Custom .
Set the Start date and time and the End date and time .
Click Apply .
View storage volume and LUN metrics
The metrics for a storage volume and its LUNs are collected only when the
storage volume is attached to a server.
To view metrics for your storage volume or LUNs, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Compute Engine > Bare Metal Solution > Volumes page.
Click the name of the volume.
Click the Observability tab.
To view metrics for the LUNs of the storage volume, click the
Show LUN details toggle.
The following charts are available:
Metric
Description
LUN throughput
The average rate of bytes written to and read from the LUN.
LUN IOPs
The average rate of I/O read and write operations to the LUN.
LUN latency
From the Chart menu, select the chart that you want to view:
LUN total latency: The average latency of I/O
operations to the LUN.
LUN latency: The average latency of I/O read and write
operations to the LUN.
LUN size
LUN space used and available.
If you don't toggle Show LUN details , the Observability tab
displays the storage volume metrics.
The following charts are available:
Metric
Description
Volume throughput
The average rate of bytes written to and read from the storage
volume.
Volume IOPs
The average rate of I/O read and write operations to the
storage volume.
Volume latency
From the Chart menu, select the chart that you want to view:
Volume total latency: The average latency of I/O
operations to the storage volume.
Volume latency: The average latency of I/O read and write operations to the storage volume.
Volume size
The storage volume space that includes both used and available space.
Select the interval from the interval picker to display data for the
chosen timeframe.
By default, the data is displayed for the last 6 hours. You can
choose intervals ranging from 1 hour to 30 days.
You can also set a custom interval by following these steps:
In the interval picker, click Custom .
Set the Start date and time and the End date and time fields.
Click Apply .
