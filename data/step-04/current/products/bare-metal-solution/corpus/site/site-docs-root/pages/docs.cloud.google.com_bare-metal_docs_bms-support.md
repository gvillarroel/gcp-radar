Troubleshooting that you have performed
Screenshot of the error, if applicable
Specific date and time if you would like to reimage the server
Alternative contact information to supplement the primary contacts you set in

Respond to the support team
If there is an issue with your Bare Metal Solution environment that requires attention,
Cloud Customer Care needs to contact you right away. The following information
explains how to set up your Google Cloud project to receive notifications from
Cloud Customer Care, the importance of keeping your contact information up to
date, and the need for you to respond promptly when we do contact you.
Set up contact information in your Google Cloud project
When you set up your Google Cloud project during the provisioning process,
there are two key items you need to configure:
Essential contacts - Technical
Project Owner(s)
The Cloud Customer Care team uses the Essential contacts - Technical
entry as the primary way to contact you, with the Project Owner (s) as a backup
contact.
To set up the Essential contacts - Technical entry in your
Google Cloud project, see
Managing contacts for notifications . We
recommend that you use a group email address as your first entry for Essential
contacts - Technical so that Cloud Customer Care
can reach your entire on-call team responsible for critical incident response.
You are responsible for managing and updating these contacts. Because of the
critical nature of this type of communication, you must review your contacts on
a regular basis and keep the contact information up to date.
When Cloud Customer Care contacts you
Cloud Customer Care contacts you proactively if there is a maintenance
or operational event that might impact your Bare Metal Solution environment, such
as:
When we need to confirm a maintenance window, and discuss the
associated downtime or actions that you need to take.
If we find an issue with your Bare Metal Solution infrastructure that
needs attention, such as an outage or hardware failure.
If there is an unresponsive server and we need your help to troubleshoot
the issue.
If we need to restore an application or database to full operation.
We also might send you maintenance notices to correct potentially impactful
hardware errors in a timely manner. If you delay in responding to us, this
inaction might expose you to additional risk of hardware failure.
For these many reasons, respond to Cloud Customer Care with urgency when
we contact you. The messages we send you alert you to either a current,
production-impacting event or a planned maintenance event. When we contact you,
be sure to call us back or reply to the email.
To learn about Bare Metal Solution maintenance process and how to prepare for the
maintenance events, see
Prepare for Bare Metal Solution maintenance events .

Generate and share SOS report
Applicable only to Oracle Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) users.
An SOS report contains configuration details, system information, and diagnostic
information of your system. We might request you for an SOS report to perform a
root cause analysis and troubleshoot your issue.
We recommend that you generate SOS reports at the following times:
Before changing the OS configuration of your server.
Immediately after changing the OS configuration but prior to rebooting the
server.
Immediately after the reboot following the change in the OS configuration.
Caution: Running the sosreport utility with
ethtool -d can cause a buffer overflow and kernel panic. Before using the
sosreport
utility, read about this issue and how to prevent it . See Buffer overflow when using ethtool with debug flag .
To generate and share an SOS report, follow these steps:
Run the following command to see if the sosreport package is installed on
your server.
rpm -qa | grep sos
If the sosreport package is installed, you'll see the version of the
sosreport package. For example:
sos-3.2-35.el7_2.3.noarch
If the package is not installed, the output is blank.
If the package is not installed, as the root user, run the following command
to install the sosreport package:
sudo yum install sos
To generate the SOS report, as the root user, run the following command:
sudo sosreport
When prompted, press the Enter or Return key to continue.
(If running Oracle Linux) When prompted, accept the default name for the
file by pressing the Enter or Return key.
When prompted, enter the case ID if you have one.
Locate the report. When the command finishes executing, you'll see the
location of the SOS report in its output, as shown in the following example:
Your sosreport has been generated and saved in:
/var/tmp/sosreport-breakboot2-2021-03-30-lyrkotf.tar.xz
Size 8.76MiB
Owner root
md5 afda594259aade437dd00c44f92d66db
Please send this file to your support representative.
By default, the system generates the report in tar format. Convert it to
zip format.
Upload the report to the support case.
If you're unable to upload the report to the case, follow these steps:
Upload the report to a Google Drive folder.
Right-click the file, and click Share .
In the Add people and groups field, enter the following email address:
