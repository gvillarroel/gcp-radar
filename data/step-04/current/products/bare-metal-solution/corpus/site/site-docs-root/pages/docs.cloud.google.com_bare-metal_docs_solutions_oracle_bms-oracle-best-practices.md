Best practices for Oracle on Bare Metal Solution
When implementing Oracle databases on Bare Metal Solution, we know that your goal
is to bring up your environment easily and with as few issues as possible. To
help you succeed in this goal, we've gathered feedback from customers, our
Solution Architects, and support staff who have implemented Oracle databases on
Bare Metal Solution. The following information provides you with recommendations
learned from these experts to help you be as successful as possible when
bringing up your own Oracle database environment on Bare Metal Solution.
Software deployment
For the most successful Oracle software deployment, we recommend that you use
the Bare Metal Solution Toolkit . The
toolkit provides several Ansible and JSON scripts to help you perform the Oracle
software installation on Bare Metal Solution. For more information about the
Bare Metal Solution Toolkit and how to install Oracle databases in a
Bare Metal Solution environment, see the toolkit user guide .
Operating system
When setting up your operating system on a Bare Metal Solution server, we
recommend you perform the following actions.
Validate your NTP servers
All Bare Metal Solution servers should be synchronized with a time source.
Select an NTP server option, either physical or virtual, that best meets your needs.
Note: If you choose to use a public time source, you need to
configure a NAT gateway on a Compute Engine VM
to provide connectivity between your Bare Metal Solution environment and the NTP
server.
When your servers use NTP for time synchronization, use the timedatectl or
ntpstat command to see if the server is synchronized with a time source. The
following examples show the output from these commands for a server that
synchronizes successfully:
timedatectl show -p NTPSynchronized
NTPSynchronized=yes
synchronised to NTP server (216.239.35.8) at stratum 3
time correct to within 49 ms
polling server every 1024 s
View Oracle VM CPU count and memory details
To view information about an Oracle VM (OVM) host, including CPU and memory
details, use the xm info command. For example:
/usr/sbin/xm info
For more information, see
Oracle documentation on viewing host information
Check your /etc/fstab settings for the correct mount options
To prevent the boot process from hanging, always configure the non-root mount
points you create (such as /u01 and /u02 ) with the nofail mount option in
place of the default settings. In rare cases, the underlying storage devices
might not be available when a host restarts. Setting the nofail mount option
allows the boot process to continue when the server cannot view the storage
devices.
The following example shows the recommended settings for the /u01 and /u02 mount
points in the /etc/fstab file:
/dev/mapper/3600a098038314352513f4f765339624c1 /u01 xfs nofail 0 0
/dev/mapper/3600a374927591837194d4j371563816c1 /u02 xfs nofail 0 0
You can modify the mount option from defaults to nofail without any impact
to an operational system. However, to apply the new settings, you need to reboot
your server.
Confirm your shell limit settings
The Bare Metal Solution toolkit configures shell limits needed to configure
Oracle RAC. You can skip this validation if you used the Bare Metal Solution
toolkit and didn't change the shell limits. Shell limits must be set for all
operating system accounts that own Oracle software, including Grid
Infrastructure. Oracle recommends the following settings for Linux:
Limit
Soft Value
Hard Value
Open files
1024
65536
Maximum user processes
16384
16384
Stack size
10240
32768
Maximum locked memory
At least 90% of memory
At least 90% of memory
Use the ulimit command to verify the soft and hard shell limits. For example,
enter this command to verify the soft shell limit:
ulimit -S -n -u -s -l
The following output shows the correct soft shell limit settings for a system
with 384 GB of memory:
open files (-n) 1024
max user processes (-u) 16384
stack size (kbytes, -s) 10240
max locked memory (kbytes, -l) 355263678
To verify the hard shell limits, use the following command:
ulimit -H -n -u -s -l
The following output shows the correct hard shell limits for a system with 384
GB of memory:
open files (-n) 65536
max user processes (-u) 16384
stack size (kbytes, -s) 32768
max locked memory (kbytes, -l) 355263678
If any of the shell limits are not set correctly, modify the entries in the
/etc/security/limits.conf file, as shown in the following example:
oracle soft nofile 1024
oracle hard nofile 65536
oracle soft nproc 2047
oracle hard nproc 16384
oracle soft stack 10240
oracle hard stack 32768
oracle soft memlock 355263678
oracle hard memlock 355263678
grid soft nofile 1024
grid hard nofile 65536
grid soft nproc 2047
grid hard nproc 16384
grid soft stack 10240
grid hard stack 32768
grid soft memlock 355263678
grid hard memlock 355263678
Note: The autogenerated memlock value might not be appropriate. As a
workaround, find the total memory with the following command and multiply it by
90% to generate a reasonable memlock value to include in the
/etc/security/limits.conf file.
grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo
MemTotal: 16092952 kB
Avoid changing your multipath settings
Note: Under normal situations, we do not recommend that you modify the multipath
settings. Only update the multipath.conf settings after careful consideration.
Modifications to the multipath.conf file can result in the loss of storage
resiliency in the event of a hardware failure.
If you choose to change the multipath settings, do not configure the
path_grouping_policy attribute if you use multipath.conf to create aliased
names for devices. Such a change overrides the default policy set in the
devices definition section.
Under normal operation, the multipath -ll command should show a status similar
to the following example. Each device includes two active paths that are in the
ready state.
3600 a0980383143524f2b50476d59554e dm - 7 NETAPP , LUN C - Mode

` -+- policy = ' service - time 0 ' prio = 10 status = enabled
| - 14 : 0 : 2 : 2 sdc 8 : 32 active read y run ning
` - 16 : 0 : 3 : 2 sdq 65 : 0 active read y run ning
Use jumbo frames
To prevent fragmentation of packets as they travel from one server to another in
a RAC environment, Oracle recommends configuring your server interfaces with
jumbo frames. Jumbo frames have an MTU size of 9000 bytes and are large enough
to support Oracle database block sizes of 8192 bytes.
Note:
Always configure jumbo frames on your Bare Metal Solution servers before
installing Oracle RAC.
Make sure your configuration uses jumbo frames on all servers in the
cluster.
Partner Interconnect does not support jumbo frames, so do not
enable jumbo frames between your Google Cloud project and your
Bare Metal Solution environment.
A services IP address range uses the standard MTU size of 1500 bytes
and does not use jumbo frames.
To configure jumbo frames on Bare Metal Solution servers for Oracle RAC:
View the settings of your Bare Metal Solution private network to confirm that
jumbo frames have been configured:
gcloud bms networks describe NETWORK_NAME -- project = PROJECT_ID -- region = REGION | grep jumboFramesEnabled
Sample output:
jumboFramesEnabled : true
Identify the network interfaces and their mtu size:
ip link show | grep mtu
Sample output:

14 : virbr0 - nic : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST > mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast master virbr0 state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
Using root-level privileges, add MTU=9000 to the interface configuration
file for all servers in the Bare Metal Solution environment that use jumbo
frames. You can find the file at
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-interface_name .

Oracle RMAN backups and latency impact
If the Oracle RMAN backup process is not limited by the RATE parameter, it can
push storage throughput or IOPS to the performance limit for a storage volume. This
causes storage IO to be throttled, thus increasing the latency
on the storage volume.
We recommend that you implement the RATE channel parameter to limit the amount
of bandwidth or throughput that the Oracle RMAN can use.
For more information, see Oracle documentation: 23.2.1.4 RATE Channel Parameter
Oracle Automatic Storage Management
Our Cloud Customer Care team and several Bare Metal Solution customers have added
Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM) to their Bare Metal Solution
environments. Through their collective experience and wisdom, we have gathered
the following list of best practices to help you be successful with your own ASM
disk group installation. Our goal is to help you achieve the best storage
performance for your
Bare Metal Solution environment.
Use a uniform LUN size
Create no more than two ASM disk groups
Stripe ASM disk groups across all LUNs in all volumes
Use LUNs and volumes with the same performance characteristics in the same disk group
Do not share storage volumes across multiple RAC clusters
Know the required IOPS and throughput capacity before you create ASM disk groups
Leave the multipath configuration as-is
Configure important settings for ASM
Create your ASM disk group with external redundancy
Reboot your Bare Metal Solution servers after ASM disk creation
Use a uniform LUN size
The LUN size you select should be representative of the unit of growth. ASM
works best with LUNs that have an equal size and similar performance
characteristics. For very large databases, we recommend a LUN size of 2 TB to
optimize performance.
Create no more than two ASM disk groups
You should send data files and one copy of the REDO logs to a single DATA disk
group. Optionally, you can create a second FRA disk group to store on-disk
backups and archive logs. When you store REDO logs on highly resilient storage,
you do not need to have two copies.
REDO log writes are sensitive to latency. As a result, only consider
multiplexing REDO logs if the performance profile of the FRA disk group matches
the performance profile of the DATA disk group.
Stripe ASM disk groups across all LUNs in all volumes
When you create ASM disk groups, stripe the disk group across all
LUNs of all volumes. If your LUNs belong to a single volume, you must include
all the LUNs in the volume when you create a disk group. For example, if a
volume has X number of LUNs, you should use all X LUNs when you create the
disk group.
This guidance also applies to using multiple volumes, because we provide QoS
limits on volumes. If you use multiple volumes for increased throughput
(>900 Mbps), you need to include all the LUNs from every volume when you create
the disk group to achieve the required performance.
Note: Do not use a partial volume to create an ASM disk group.
Use LUNs and volumes with the same performance characteristics in the same disk group
If you use multiple volumes to enhance throughput, use the same
volume size and performance characteristics when you create ASM disk groups.
Do not mix LUNs from volumes that have different performance characteristics.
If you do include LUNs and volumes with different performance profiles in the
same disk group, disks that perform I/O operations might have a much lower
performance ceiling and might cause latency spikes.
For example, if you create an ASM disk group with 2 uneven volumes (1 X 16 TiB
and 1 X 5 TiB), the I/O operations performed by the disks in the 5 TB volume
might cause elevated latency. The 5 TiB volume has a much lower throughput and
IOPS ceiling, so it would hit the throttling level long before the throttling
level for the 16 TiB volume.
Do not share storage volumes across multiple RAC clusters
For each RAC cluster, provision a unique storage volume. Do not share the same
storage volume across multiple RAC clusters. Because storage devices apply QoS
at the volume level, this practice minimizes the chance of noisy neighbors
competing for a single pool of IOPS and throughput.
For example, if a single volume has 8 LUNs, do not assign some of the LUNs to
one RAC database cluster and the remaining LUNs to a different RAC database
cluster. Instead, provision two separate storage volumes and assign each volume
to a separate, dedicated RAC cluster per volume.
Know the required IOPS and throughput capacity before you create ASM disk groups
Be aware of the peak performance numbers for your on-premises environment. To
find this information, generate AWR reports during peak workloads hours to
record your system's peak IOPS and throughput values. You can also use our
Oracle Database Assessment tool
to gather your peak performance numbers.
With your on-premises performance numbers handy, check our Bare Metal Solution
storage performance table
to calculate the amount of storage that you need to allocate to your ASM disk
groups and achieve the required performance. When you have enhanced throughput
requirements (>768 Mbps), you can create multiple volumes and stripe the ASM
disk group across all LUNs and all volumes.
Leave the multipath configuration as-is
You should not change the default group_pathing_policy in the
/etc/multipath.conf file. You should always use the default value of
group_pathing_policy=group_by_prio to avoid RAC node eviction in case of
storage path failures.
For more details about leaving the multipath configuration intact, see
Avoid changing your multipath settings .
Configure important settings for ASM
If you are using Oracle Grid Infrastructure 12.1.0.2 or later on Linux, set up
ASM with ASMFD or UDEV.
For prior versions of Oracle Grid Infrastructure, use ASMLib.
To stop Oracle ASM from selecting your single path ASM device first, set the
scan order as follows:
ORACLEASM_SCANORDER="dm"
ORACLEASM_SCANEXCLUDE="sd"
We require this setting because the Bare Metal Solution storage environment
uses DM devices that you can view in /proc/partitions .
To check if ASMLib is configured to manage your ASM disks, run the following
command as the root user:
/usr/sbin/oracleasm configure | grep SCAN
If you're using ASMLib, the output looks like the following:
ORACLEASM_SCANBOOT=true
ORACLEASM_SCANORDER="dm"
ORACLEASM_SCANEXCLUDE="sd"
ORACLEASM_SCAN_DIRECTORIES=""
Note:
Never use the /dev/sd* names directly when you create or
label the ASM disks. Because of ASMLib, ASMFD, and UDEV rules, you need to use
the /dev/mapper or dm device names directly so
the application can survive a single path failure or OS reboot.
These instructions use 10g as a value, but the behavior is the same for
19c Grid Infrastructure as well. (Follow MOS Note : 1679409.1)
Create your ASM disk group with external redundancy
The storage provided by Bare Metal Solution uses
NETAPP RAID-DP ,
which is a form of RAID 6 that protects data even if two disks fail. As a result,
we recommend that you use external redundancy for ASM.
Reboot your Bare Metal Solution servers after ASM disk creation
After you create your ASM disk groups, you should reboot all Bare Metal Solution
servers in the cluster to make sure that both the ASM instance and the disk
groups come online after the reboot. Follow this proactive step so that you can
avoid issues that might happen after the database cluster is built on the ASM
disk group.
Oracle RAC
This section explains best practices when installing Oracle Real Application
Clusters (RAC) on Bare Metal Solution.
Oracle Grid Infrastructure cluster name length
Use a cluster name that is not more than 15 characters long.
A cluster name longer than 15 characters causes the root.sh script to fail.
Tunnel VNC Viewer over SSH
Arbitrary servers, such as VNC Viewer, are blocked by the default OS firewall
of the Bare Metal Solution server. Therefore, tunnel either X Window or VNC
Viewer over SSH:
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 bms-host
vncviewer localhost:1
Enough space for the root file system
Ensure that the root file system (/) has enough free space. Bare Metal Solution
servers come with a 20GB root file system which might not be sufficient.
On your Bare Metal Solution server, check the size of the root '/' file system.
The default size is 20GB which might not be sufficient. If the size is 20GB,
increase it.
Use a name server as a substitute for Cloud DNS
If you don't want to use the Cloud DNS, then install your own name server
to resolve host IP addresses on the Bare Metal Solution server. The Oracle
Grid Infrastructure uses the nslookup command to get the name of the DNS server.
The nslookup command doesn't use the /etc/hosts file.
Follow these steps:
Install dnsmasq .
yum makecache
yum install dnsmasq
Open the /etc/dnsmasq.conf file in edit mode.
vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf
In the /etc/dnsmasq.conf file, add the following lines:
port=53
domain-needed
bogus-priv
strict-order
expand-hosts
domain=localdomain
address=/.localdomain/127.0.0.1
address=//127.0.0.1
listen-address=127.0.0.1
resolv-file=/etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf
Edit the /etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf file and the /etc/resolv.conf file to
contain only the following line:
nameserver 127.0.0.1
Start the dnsmasq service:
systemctl restart dnsmasq
systemctl status dnsmasq
On both nodes, run the nslookup command.
nslookup at-2811641-svr001
Server: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
Name: at-2811641-svr001
Address: 192.168.1.10
nslookup at-2811641-svr002
Server: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
Name: at-2811641-svr002
Address: 192.168.1.11
Install NTP
When you install NTP, ensure that all the RAC nodes sync with the time of your
jump host or your internal NTP server. Follow these steps:
Install NTP.
yum install ntp
Start the ntpd service.
systemctl start ntpd
In the /etc/ntp.conf file, add the following line to sync with the bastion
host, which is 10.x.x.x in this case. You can also use your internal NTP
server. In this case, 192.x.x.x is your Bare Metal Solution server.
restrict 192.x.x.x mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap
server 10.x.x.x prefer
To start syncing, update the time server to start syncing.
ntpdate -qu SERVER_NAME
Run root script on one node at a time
Run the root script root.sh on one node at a time. If the execution fails on
the first node, don't proceed to the next node.
Resolve the Localhost
Because the Bare Metal Solution server doesn't add the Localhost to
/etc/hosts file, manually resolve the Localhost to 127.0.0.1 .
Ensure sufficient resource limits
Before installing Oracle RAC on the Bare Metal Solution server, ensure that the
resource limits for the root user and the oracle user are sufficient.
You can use the ulimit command to check the limits.
Set the ORACLEASM_SCANORDER variable
If you're using Oracle ASMLib, then to stop Oracle ASM from selecting your
single path ASM device first, set the scan order as follows:
ORACLEASM_SCANORDER="dm"
ORACLEASM_SCANEXCLUDE="sd"
We require this setting because the Bare Metal Solution storage environment
uses DM devices that you can view in /proc/partitions file.
Note: This instruction is for Oracle 10g, but the behavior is the same for
19c Grid Infrastructure as well.
