Create Oracle backups with Filestore on Bare Metal Solution
This guide shows how to implement Filestore on Bare Metal Solution for
Oracle backups.
Filestore is a fully managed file storage that you can use with
Bare Metal Solution. It is scalable and provides a consistent view of the data in
your file system. For more information about Filestore, see
Filestore overview .
This guide assumes that you are familiar with
Bare Metal Solution network architecture .
Deployment
In this guide, we create a deployment that meets the following criteria:
A Bare Metal Solution server is connected to the
Google Cloud project by Partner Interconnect.
Two Cloud Routers are available for the Partner Interconnect
setup.
A Filestore instance is available in the same VPC network as the
Bare Metal Solution server.
The Bare Metal Solution server is able to talk
to the Filestore file share using the NFS ports
(111, 2049, 2050).
The Bare Metal Solution server and the Filestore instance are
aware of each other's IP range by advertising the default IP range
( 0.0.0.0/0 ) in the Cloud Routers.
In this example deployment, the Bare Metal Solution server is hosted on the
ops-peering-vpc VPC network in the Southamerica-east1 region. The
Cloud Routers are ops-peering-sp-router-a1 and
ops-peering-sp-router-a2 .
You can relate the preceding environment considerations to your own network
infrastructure and modify the deployment accordingly.
Implement Filestore on Bare Metal Solution
Implementing Filestore on Bare Metal Solution involves the following
steps:
Create a Filestore instance .
Create a firewall rule .
Advertise a default route .
Mount the Filestore file share .
Validate the Filestore file share .
Change the ownership of the NFS mount point .
Run an RMAN backup .
Validate the backup .
Create a Filestore instance
Create a Filestore instance
in the same network and region as that of your Bare Metal Solution server.
Keep the following considerations in mind for this implementation:
Region and Zone : Select the same region and zone as that of
your Bare Metal Solution server. In this case, the region is
southamerica-east1 and the zone is southamerica-east1-a .
VPC Network : Select the network that is connected
to your Bare Metal Solution server. In this case, select ops-peering-vpc .
Allocated IP range : To use an existing allocated IP range in the
network, select Use an existing allocated IP range . Otherwise, select
Use an automatically allocated IP range to automatically create an IP
range and a private service access connection.
Access control : Do the following:
Select Restrict access by IP address or range .
Enter the IP CIDR that contains the Bare Metal Solution server for
Filestore to be able to connect to the Bare Metal Solution server.
Select the access level.
Note: This step is required because the Bare Metal Solution server is
hosted in a regional extension. Therefore, the default option of
Grant access to all clients on the VPC network does not automatically
allow the Bare Metal Solution server to access the Filestore
instance.
Create a firewall rule
Create a firewall rule
for the Bare Metal Solution server to connect with the Filestore
instance.
Keep the following considerations in mind for this implementation:
Network : Select your VPC network. In this case, select ops-peering-vpc .
Priority : Specify 1000 .
Direction : Select ingress .
IP ranges : You can either allow access to all IP addresses in the network
or you can limit the access to your Bare Metal Solution environment.
Protocols and ports : Do the following:
Select Specified protocols and ports .
Select TCP .
Enter a comma-delimited list of destination ports (111, 2049, 2050).
Advertise a default route
Advertise a default route ( 0.0.0.0/0 ) in the Cloud Routers.
Follow the steps in
Add a custom advertisement for a default IP range to your BGP sessions .
A Partner Interconnect setup comes with two
Cloud Routers (in this case, ops-peering-sp-router-a1 and
ops-peering-sp-router-a2 ). You can advertise the default route in any one
router. However, for high availability and fault tolerance, we recommend
advertising a default route in both Cloud Routers.
Mount the Filestore file share
Mount the Filestore file share on the Bare Metal Solution server.
Perform the following steps as the root user:
In your Bare Metal Solution server, create an NFS mount point for the
Filestore file share.
mkdir /nfs_backups
Mount the file share by running the mount command and specifying the
Filestore instance IP address and name of the file share.
mount \
-o hard,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,resvport,async \
FILESTORE_IP_ADDRESS :/ FILESTORE_FILE_SHARE / NFS_MOUNT_POINT
Replace the following:
FILESTORE_IP_ADDRESS : IP address of the
Filestore instance.
FILESTORE_FILE_SHARE : Name of the
Filestore file share.
NFS_MOUNT_POINT : Name of the NFS mount point
that you created in the previous step.
For this deployment, run the following command:
mount \
-o hard,vers=3,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,resvport,async \
10.177.199.242:/oracle_backups /nfs_backups
Note: For more information about the mount options, see
Optimize and test Filestore performance .
Validate the Filestore file share
To validate the Filestore file share, run the following commands:
df -h | grep FILESTORE_FILE_SHARE
oracle_backup_psoracle 1.0P 0 1.0P 0% /home/oracle/backups
10.177.199.242:/oracle_backups 2.5T 484G 1.9T 21% /nfs_backups
cd /nfs_backups
touch TEST_FILENAME
ls -ltr
total 16
drwx------. 2 root root 16384 Sep 16 03:43 lost+found
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Sep 16 2020 a
Change the ownership of the NFS mount point
Change the ownership of the NFS mount point. The Filestore file
share is mounted as root .
In this case, you use the file share for Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN)
backups. Therefore, you need to change the ownership of the NFS mount point
to the oracle user and grant the required permissions to read and write.
chown -R oracle:oinstall /nfs_backups
chmod -R 755 /nfs_backups
Run an RMAN backup
After you have mounted the file share in the Bare Metal Solution server, you can
use it to run the RMAN backups.
Run the following commands:
rman target /
run
{
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE disk format '/nfs_backups/%U';
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c2 DEVICE TYPE disk format '/nfs_backups/%U';
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c3 DEVICE TYPE disk format '/nfs_backups/%U';
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c4 DEVICE TYPE disk format '/nfs_backups/%U';
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c5 DEVICE TYPE disk format '/nfs_backups/%U';
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c6 DEVICE TYPE disk format '/nfs_backups/%U';
