Add NFS file storage to a Bare Metal Solution environment
This guide provides instructions for setting up and using Network File System
(NFS) for file storage in a Bare Metal Solution environment. This document
assumes basic familiarity with using NFS file systems and basic knowledge of
Linux system administration.
Understand NFS file storage for Bare Metal Solution
You can use NFS as local, shared, file storage for common scripts, installation
files, and backup files. An NFS volume provides storage to one or more
Bare Metal Solution servers through an NFS mounted directory. After you mount
the NFS volume on your Bare Metal Solution servers, you can access the storage
like any other file system.
Using NFS file storage on Bare Metal Solution requires 2 steps:
Decide on the settings you want for the NFS volume and share them with
Google Cloud.
Mount the NFS volume on your Bare Metal Solution server.
Here are some helpful tips and facts to assist you when using NFS file
storage on Bare Metal Solution:
Bare Metal Solution servers communicate with the NFS volume across a services
subnet reserved from the client or private networks that you assigned to the
Bare Metal Solution environment. For typical /24 networks, we recommend you
use a /28 subnet for services such as NFS.
You can assign one NFS volume per subnet. As a result, NFS volumes cannot be
shared across multiple VLANs.
Google Cloud uses NFS v3 in the Bare Metal Solution environment.
We do not recommend using NFS to store Oracle data files or log files.
Google Cloud provides NFS within the same regional extension that
hosts Bare Metal Solution. NFS file storage does not span across Google Cloud
regions. If you require multi-region shared storage, consider using
Filestore . We do not provide storage-based replication between NFS
volumes or regions.
Google Cloud encrypts data at rest. For data in transit between a
Bare Metal Solution server and the storage device, data is not encrypted.
If you need data encryption of data for transit traffic, we recommend that
you configure encryption at the application level. For more information, see
How can I encrypt my traffic over Cloud Interconnect?
NFS file storage for Bare Metal Solution does not provide throttling on
network bandwidth. Because high-volume, high-concurrency batch workloads
(such as backups) might affect the performance of other workloads, consider
limiting the bandwidth usage and simultaneous processing of such batch
workloads.
Other shared storage options provided by Google Cloud include
Filestore
and
Google Cloud Storage buckets mounted with FUSE
on the Bare Metal Solution server. You can allocate this storage
dynamically in Google Cloud using the Google Cloud console and
uses the Cloud Interconnect joining the regional extension to the
Google Cloud region.
For more information about NFS, see
Network File System .
For more information about using NFS file storage with an Oracle database, see
the following articles (requires an Oracle account):
RMAN with NFS
Direct NFS Client Mounts to NFS Storage Devices
Request NFS file storage for Bare Metal Solution
When you want to add NFS file storage to your Bare Metal Solution environment,
you need to order your NFS volumes through
Google Cloud Sales . After you
order the NFS volumes and we assign them to you, you can set them up by
following the steps in
Create an NFS volume .
You can view your available volume quota in the Volumes section of the
Google Cloud console intake form , as shown in the following example:
If you do not have enough volume quota available for provisioning, please contact Google Cloud Sales to order more.
Once your volume quota is available, you need to gather and provide the
following information to
provision NFS file storage for your Bare Metal Solution environment:
Field
Description
Example
Google Cloud project ID
Visit the Welcome page of your Google Cloud project
to find your Project ID.
My Project
Region
Google Cloud region nearby the regional extension that hosts your
Bare Metal Solution environment.
us-central1
Client and Private networks
The two subnets you selected when you set up your Bare Metal Solution
environment.
In our documentation examples, 192.168.1.0/24 is the
client network that connects to Google Cloud, and
192.168.2.0/24 is the private network used for
services within the regional extension.
Name
Name of the NFS volume.
Select a name for the volume. If you do not choose a name, Google Cloud
generates the NFS volume name for you automatically. An example name is
at-1234567-nfs001 .
Type
The type of storage you request to save your data. Options include
All flash to select a solid-state drive (SSD) and
All disk to select a hard disk drive (HDD).
All flash
Size
Select the size of the drive you need. You can choose a minimum of 100 GiB
up to a maximum of 16 TiB worth of storage capacity.
1 TiB (1024 GiB)
Enable snapshots
Choose Yes if you want to enable a daily snapshot, or
choose No to disable.
If you turn this feature on, Google Cloud performs a
snapshot of the NFS volume every day for 7 days. After 7 days, newer
snapshots overwrite the older ones. Also, we reserve 20% of the requested
NFS storage for the snapshots.
If you do not enable this feature, you must perform your own backups of
the NFS volume.
Yes
Protocol
Specify the storage protocol that you want to use. Use this field to tell us
that you need NFS.
NFS (Network File System)
Network
Subnet that can access the NFS volume. Usually, this is the client network
in a Bare Metal Solution environment.
Reuse the value you selected above in Client and Private networks.
Target
Allows access to the NFS volume from an individual Bare Metal Solution
server ( Single
server ), or all servers on a subnet ( CIDR ).
CIDR
Server
Name of the Bare Metal Solution server that can access the NFS volume.
For example, at-7654321-svr001
Service IP Address range
Select a subset of your network IP address range from your client or private
network to be used for storage and services. Google Cloud reserves this
range for services such as NFS. The service IP address range typically uses a
/26, /27, or /28 subnet.
For an Oracle installation, use your Bare Metal Solution client network for NFS
file storage and reserve the private network for Oracle applications.
In this example, 192.168.1.240/28 is a subnet of the
client network.
Mount permissions
Select read-write or read-only permissions.
Read-write
No root squash
We recommend that you set this option to True for new NFS volumes.
By default, an NFS volume has permission 755 and owner root(0) .
Writing files to new NFS volumes is not possible when root squash is enabled,
as all new NFS volumes are owned by user "root". Therefore, first
create an NFS volume with no_root_squash=True , build the directory
structure, change permission or ownership of the NFS volume, and then modify
the NFS volume with no_root_squash=False by removing and re-adding
the allowed client.
See
Update an NFS volume .
True
Allow SUID
Selecting this option enables users to receive file owner permissions
temporarily when executing a file, program, or command. If you do not
select this option, NFS does not provide temporary file owner
permissions.
False
Allow dev
Selecting this option enables the file system to interpret character or
block special devices. If you do not select this option, the system can still
write to the NFS volume, but cannot create character or block special devices.
True
After Google Cloud processes your order, you'll be sent an NFS volume
path. It appears in the following format:
NFS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:/NFS_SHARE_NAME
For example, if the NFS server IP address is 192.168.1.240 and the
NFS share name is at-1234567-nfs001 , the resulting NFS volume path looks
like this:
192.168.1.240:/at-1234567-nfs001
Configure NFS file storage for Bare Metal Solution
The following example helps you configure NFS file storage for your
Bare Metal Solution servers, and uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux commands . If you use a different operating system, the commands you need to use might be
different.
Before you mount the NFS volume.
Ensure you have created a jump host VM instance to access your
Bare Metal Solution server. For information, see
Create a jump host VM instance on Google Cloud .
Provide internet access to your Bare Metal Solution server so it
can download any required installation packages. For information about
internet access, see
Accessing the internet .
Navigate to your Bare Metal Solution server console.
In your Google Cloud project, navigate to
Compute Engine > VM instances .
Click the SSH button for your jump host VM instance.
Use SSH to connect to your Bare Metal Solution server and log in with
your username and password.
[ USERNAME @ INSTANCE_JUMP_HOST ~]$ ssh ADMIN_USER @ BMS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
ADMIN_USER @ BMS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS 's password:
Last login: Wed May 26 22:25:47 2021 from JUMP_HOST_IP_ADDRESS
[ ADMIN_USER @ BMS_SERVER_NAME ~]$
Add a DNS server entry in your Bare Metal Solution server to access DNS.
sudo bash -c "echo \"nameserver DNS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS \" >> /etc/resolv.conf"
You can also use Cloud DNS and specify inbound forwarder entry points in
place of the DNS server IP address. For more information on Cloud DNS,
see Cloud DNS overview .
Configure your operating system to allow package updates.
Install the NFS package in your Bare Metal Solution server.
sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
Mount your NFS volume.
Create a mount directory in your Bare Metal Solution server.
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ DIRECTORY_NAME
Find your NFS volume path sent to you by Google Cloud.
Mount the NFS volume. For generic usage of NFS, use the following
command:
sudo mount -t nfs NFS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS :/ NFS_SHARE_NAME /mnt/ DIRECTORY_NAME
Depending on your workload, you can add the nconnect option to
achieve the best performance. Use the following command to mount an NFS
volume with the nconnect option. For RHEL 7, use multiple NFS clients
to achieve similar performance.
sudo mount -t nfs -o \
rw,bg,hard,nointr,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,tcp,vers=3,timeo=600,nconnect=8 \
NFS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS :/ NFS_SHARE_NAME /mnt/ DIRECTORY_NAME
For most Oracle implementations in a Bare Metal Solution environment,
use the following command to mount the volume.
sudo mount -t nfs -o \
rw,bg,hard,nointr,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,tcp,vers=3,timeo=600 \
NFS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS :/ NFS_SHARE_NAME /mnt/ DIRECTORY_NAME
If your Oracle implementation requires the storage of live Oracle RAC
binaries or data files on the NFS volume, enter the following command
that uses the actimeo option. This disables client-side attribute
caching when writing concurrently from multiple clients, but can impact
I/O performance.
sudo mount -t nfs -o \
-rw,bg,hard,nointr,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,tcp,vers=3,timeo=600,actimeo=0 \
NFS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS :/ NFS_SHARE_NAME /mnt/ DIRECTORY_NAME
To mount the NFS volume automatically if the server reboots, add the
following entries to the end of the fstab file. This file is in the
/etc directory of your Bare Metal Solution server. Use sudo
administrator permissions and a text editor to edit the file, and ensure
there are 3 spaces between each entry.
NFS_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS :/ NFS_SHARE_NAME /mnt/ DIRECTORY_NAME nfs defaults,nofail 0 0
[ ADMIN_USER @ BMS_SERVER_NAME ~]$ sudo -i
[root@ BMS_SERVER_NAME ~]# cd /etc
[root@ BMS_SERVER_NAME etc]# vi fstab
[root@ BMS_SERVER_NAME etc]# cat fstab
