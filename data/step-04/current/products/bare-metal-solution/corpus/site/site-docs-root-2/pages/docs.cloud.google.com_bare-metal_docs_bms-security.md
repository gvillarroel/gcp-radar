Provide security for enterprise workloads in a Bare Metal Solution environment
Because Bare Metal Solution enables you to bring traditional enterprise
workloads closer to Google Cloud, a common question from enterprise architects
and security architects is "How do I secure my workloads?" The goal of this
guide is to provide you with the security and compliance design elements that
you should consider when planning to bring your enterprise workloads, such as
Oracle databases, to Bare Metal Solution. We'll also discuss Google Cloud's
security controls and features that safeguard your enterprise assets, and point
you to some of Oracle's security best practices.
Security in a Bare Metal Solution environment
The Bare Metal Solution environment includes purpose-built, bare-metal servers
hosted in regional extensions . As seen in Figure 1 , a
regional extension is a colocation facility placed near select
Google Cloud regions and connected to Google Cloud with a
managed high-performance connection and a low-latency network fabric.
Figure 1: Bare Metal Solution - Regional Extension connected to
Google Cloud
Because of this architecture, you need to consider ways to secure both your
Bare Metal Solution servers and the Google Cloud components included in
your design. Fortunately, Google Cloud provides and manages the following
components for Bare Metal Solution:
Core infrastructure, including secure, controlled-environment
facilities and power
Physical security
Network infrastructure and security
Hardware monitoring capabilities
Access to Google Cloud services
Provisioning and maintenance of sole-tenancy hardware
Local storage area network (SAN)
Smart hands support: Onsite support for activities like hardware
replacements
In a Bare Metal Solution environment, security is a shared responsibility. The
good news is that you can bring your own security best practices and supplement
them with the built-in offerings that Bare Metal Solution provides. Figure 2
shows a summary of which security components that you need to supply, and which
ones Google Cloud provides.
Figure 2: Summary of security responsibilities - customer and
Google Cloud
Plan security for your Bare Metal Solution environment
To plan your security strategy for Bare Metal Solution, you need to consider the
following six security pillars :
Physical security
Compliance
Network security
Data security
Operational security
Database security
Let's explore each of these security pillars in more detail.
Physical security
The physical components of Bare Metal Solution reside in a regional extension (a
colocation facility) run by a vendor. A high speed, low-latency
Partner Interconnect
connection links the regional extension to the nearest Google Cloud
region.
The vendor manages the regional extension and its facilities, such as power,
cooling, racking and stacking, and storage management. The vendor also maintains
industry standard physical security and safety features, including, but not
limited to the following:
Cages have secure slab-to-slab walls or mesh tops.
Video cameras at each facility monitor the cages, aisles, and doors 24
hours a day, 7 days a week. The cameras have a clear view inside each cage,
for every aisle, and for every entrance and exit door.
All doors in the facility have alarms to ensure that they are closed
properly.
Anyone entering a cage must have prior approval from the regional
extension coordination team, and appropriate access granted through the
regional extension security team.
The regional extension coordination team manages all access with
individual tickets per visit.
The facility requires authorized staff to use a biometric lock to enter
the facility and a badge to exit.
All racks are locked. An electronic key locker distributes keys for
specific racks to authorized staff on a limited "need-to-use" basis. The
key locker also tracks rack access.
A colocation security team manages access and maintains reporting based
on PCI and ISO compliance certification requirements.
Other physical security measures are consistent with industry best
practices and applicable regulatory requirements.
Compliance
Bare Metal Solution meets demanding compliance requirements with industry
certifications such as ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA, plus regional certifications
where applicable. For more information about compliance, please visit the
Compliance resource center .
Network security
Network security is offered at two layers, as shown in Figure 3 :
Layer 3 VLAN attachments connect your Google Virtual Private Cloud to a unique
virtual routing and forwarding instance (VRF) on the Bare Metal Solution
edge routers.
Within the Bare Metal Solution environment, Layer 2 VLANs provide the
security and isolation necessary for your data. You use a client subnet
to connect to Google Cloud, and an optional private subnet to host
your own services and storage.
Figure 3: Network security in a Bare Metal Solution environment
If you use Google Cloud APIs from within the Bare Metal Solution
environment to access Google Cloud services, Google Cloud encrypts
the data transfer by default between Bare Metal Solution and the particular
service per our encryption policies. For example, if you use the Google Cloud CLI
or APIs to back up data in Cloud Storage, the transfer of the data
from Bare Metal Solution to Cloud Storage uses data encryption by default.
Enforce a secure perimeter with Private Google Access
Private Google Access
(also known as VPC service controls ) enables you to define security perimeters
around sensitive data in Google Cloud services and offers the following
benefits:
Mitigates data exfiltration risks. Data exfiltration happens when an
authorized person extracts data from a secured system where the data
belongs, and either shares it with an unauthorized third party or moves it
to an insecure system.
Accesses Google Cloud services privately from on-premises.
Enforces context-aware access from the internet.
Manages security policies from a central location.
With Bare Metal Solution, you can leverage Google Cloud's cloud-native
and scalable services by way of the Partner Interconnect.
Enabling a VPC Service controls-based perimeter further ensures that the access
to all Google Cloud services, such as BigQuery and
Cloud Storage, happens without any data exfiltration to the internet.
To set up private access to Google APIs, see
Configuring Private Google Access for on-premises hosts .
Figure 4 shows an example of Private Google Access:
Figure 4: Private Google Access in a Bare Metal Solution environment
Data security
When planning for data security in a Bare Metal Solution environment, you need to
be aware of how encrypted data gets stored and how to secure your applications
running on Google Cloud or in an on-premises data center.
Storage encryption
By default, Bare Metal Solution encrypts data at rest. Here are a few facts
about storage encryption at rest in a Bare Metal Solution environment:
To provision storage, we create a Storage Virtual Machine
(SVM) on a NetApp cluster for each customer, and associate the SVM with a
reserved data volume before giving it to the customer.
When we create an encrypted data volume, the encryption process
generates a unique XTSAES-256 data encryption key. We never pre-generate a key.
The SVMs provide isolation in a multitenant environment. Each
SVM appears as a single independent server, which enables multiple SVMs
to coexist in a cluster and ensures that no data flows between the SVMs.
We do not display the keys in plain text. The NetApp onboard key
manager stores, manages, and protects the keys.
Neither Google Cloud nor the vendor have access to your keys.
The Netapp Storage Cluster stores and encrypts all data at rest,
including the operating system and boot partitions.
If you choose to stop using Bare Metal Solution at the end of
your contract, we cryptographically erase and quarantine your storage
volumes for 7 days before they can be reused.
Application security
When working with Bare Metal Solution, you can secure your applications running
in either Google Cloud or in an on-premises environment.
Applications running in Google Cloud
Bare Metal Solution runs in regional extensions; the only network path
to or from the regional extension is through a
Partner Interconnect to the associated Google Cloud
region over customer-specific VLAN attachments.
By default, Bare Metal Solution servers do not have internet access. If
you need internet access for operations like patching or updates, create a
NAT instance. For more information, see
Accessing the internet .
A BGP session provides dynamic routing between the Cloud Routers in
the VPC and the regional extension's routers. As a result, if you place
resources in the VPC attached to the regional extension, these resources
have direct access to the Bare Metal Solution servers. Similarly, resources
running in newly added subnets also have access to the Bare Metal Solution
servers. If you need to allow or deny access to specific resources, use
firewall policies to restrict the default behavior that permits access to
all Bare Metal Solution resources.
As shown in Figure 5 , use VPC peering to enable resources running in a
different VPC in the same project or a different project to access the
Bare Metal Solution servers. On the redundant Cloud Routers, add a
custom advertisement pointing to the CIDR range of the peered network.
Figure 5: VPC peering and the Bare Metal Solution environment
As shown in Figure 6 , use a shared VPC architecture to allow resources
from different projects to access the Bare Metal Solution servers. In this
case, you must create VLAN attachments in the host project so that all
resources can access the servers attached to the shared VPC.
Figure 6: Shared VPC and the Bare Metal Solution environment
You can back up your databases with either Oracle Recovery Manager
(RMAN) or backup solutions like Actifio. To learn how Actifio integrates
natively with RMAN, see the following
Actifio guide .
You can store backup data in
Cloud Storage
and select different Cloud Storage tiers to satisfy your
requirements for the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and the Recovery Point
Objective (RPO).
Applications running on-premises
As previously mentioned, the only network path to or from the
Bare Metal Solution regional extension is through a
Partner Interconnect to the associated Google Cloud
region. To connect to your Bare Metal Solution servers from your on-premises
environment, you must connect your on-premises data center to
Google Cloud by using a
Dedicated Interconnect ,
Partner Interconnect ,
or
Cloud VPN .
For more information about these connection options, see
Choosing a Network Connectivity product .
To enable routes to your on-premises network, you must modify the
redundant Cloud Routers with a custom advertisement pointing to
the CIDR range of the on-premises subnet. Use firewall rules to allow or
block access to the servers.
Operational security
In the Physical Security section of this guide, you learned that we heavily
restrict access to the Bare Metal Solution infrastructure within a regional
extension. We provide access to authorized staff on a temporary, limited,
"need-to-use" basis. We audit the access logs, analyze them to detect any
anomalies, and use 24/7 monitoring and alerting to prevent unauthorized access.
For operational security, there are several options. One solution that
integrates natively with Google Cloud is Blue Medora's
Bindplane
product.
Bindplane
integrates with
Google Cloud Observability agents
and lets you to capture metrics and logs from the
Bare Metal Solution infrastructure, including Oracle database and Oracle
applications logs.
Prometheus
is an open source monitoring solution that you can use to monitor the
Bare Metal Solution infrastructure and the Oracle databases running on top of it.
You can direct database and system audit trails into Prometheus, which acts as a
single pane of glass to monitor and send alerts for any suspicious activity.
Oracle Enterprise Manager
is popular with those who use it in an on-premises environment.
You can use OEM in a Bare Metal Solution environment to perform monitoring and
alerting tasks in the same way as your on-premises data center.
Database security
We designed Bare Metal Solution to be as similar as possible to your on-premises
environment so that you can use it with the least amount of effort and learning.
As a result, you can easily bring your existing security-related Oracle database
features, security practices, and processes to Bare Metal Solution. You can
supplement your security portfolio with the security features that
Google Cloud provides.
For database security, let's review the Oracle's security controls that you
should enable. This includes user authentication, authorization and access
control, auditing, and encryption.
User authentication
Implement password policies, such as complexity and length, if using
basic authentication.
Strengthen your authentication system by using TLS certificates,
Kerberos, or RADIUS.
Use proxy-based authentication to enable authentication and auditing at
the database level. This method is useful if you choose not to map
application users to database users and you enable authentication at the
application level.
For more authentication recommendations, see
Configuring Authentication
in the Oracle Database Security Guide.
Authorization and access control
Manage authorization through object privileges , system privileges ,
and roles identified inside the database. You can also complement this
practice with more advanced and secure features like Database Vault.
Manage users and groups with Centrally Managed Users (CMU). With CMU,
you can leverage your existing Active Directory infrastructure to
centralize the management of database users and authorization across
multiple Oracle databases.
For more information about CMU, see
Configuring Centrally Managed Users with Microsoft Active Directory
in the Oracle Database Security Guide.
Use Database Vault to introduce separation of duties and access control
for highly privileged users.
For more information about Database Vault, see the
Oracle Database Vault Administrator's Guide .
Leverage additional tools and techniques, such as privilege analysis
and data redaction .
The privilege analysis tool helps you actively monitor the
usage of privileges and roles by end users. For more information on
privilege analysis, see
Performing Privilege Analysis to Find Privilege Use
in the Oracle Database Security Guide.
Data redaction removes sensitive column data and allows access
only to required users. For more information on data redaction, see
Using Oracle Data Redaction
in the Oracle Database Advanced Security Guide.
Use Virtual Private Database (VPD) and Oracle Label Security (OLS)
to create fine-grained access to data by modifying user queries
dynamically. These tools exclude rows that are filtered by the VPD policy,
and manage row and user labels to identify whether a user should have
access to a specific row.
For more details on VPD, see
Using Oracle Virtual Private Database to Control Data Access
in the Oracle Database Security Guide.
For more details on OLS, see the
Oracle Label Security Administrator's Guide .
Follow the principle of least privilege by assigning fine-grained role
privileges to groups and users.
Auditing
Leverage unified auditing , a feature that sends all audit data to a
unified audit trail. Introduced in Release 12c to replace traditional
database auditing, this feature creates a central trail file for all
database-related audit events and enhances audit report performance.
Enable fine grained auditing (FGA) to extend traditional auditing
capabilities. This feature captures audit data only when a user accesses a
specific column or meets a specific condition.
Use audit vault database firewall (AVDF) to manage audit policies and
captured events. One of the main use cases for ADVF is to prevent SQL injection attacks. You
set up the database firewall to monitor all SQL statements issued against
the database for a full application lifecycle. The database builds a set of
trusted clusters, then blocks any SQL statement not known to the database
firewall.
For more information, see the
Monitoring Database Activity with Auditing
in the Oracle Database Security Guide and the
Audit Vault and Database Firewall Guide .
Encryption for data at rest and in-transit
While Bare Metal Solution automatically encrypts user data at rest using
a unique AES 256-bit key per data volume , you can also enable Transparent
Data Encryption (TDE) to gain more control over the encryption key lifecycle.
Use native network encryption or Transport Layer Security
(TLS)-based encryption to secure data between the client and the database.
When using customer managed encryption keys (CMEK) for Oracle database
data, use the advanced security option (ASO) to enable encryption,
cryptographic network checksums (different from log checksum during reads
and writes), and authentication services between the primary and standby
systems in Data Guard.
For more details on encryption options, see Using Transparent Data Encryption
in the Oracle Database Advanced Security Guide.
The suggestions we've mentioned for Oracle Database security on
Bare Metal Solution are not intended to be an exhaustive list. We strongly
recommend that you follow the best practices and recommendations provided by
Oracle, and implement appropriate controls that suit your specific business and
security needs.
