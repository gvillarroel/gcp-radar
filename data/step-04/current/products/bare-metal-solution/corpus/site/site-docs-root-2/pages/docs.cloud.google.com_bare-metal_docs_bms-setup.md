Set up Google Cloud to work with your Bare Metal Solution environment
When your Bare Metal Solution environment is ready, you are notified by
Google Cloud. The notification includes
the internal IP addresses of your new servers.
These instructions show you how to do the following tasks that are
required to connect to your Bare Metal Solution environment:
Create redundant VLAN attachments to the Bare Metal Solution environment.
Create a jump host VM instance in your VPC network.
Use SSH or RDP to log in to your Bare Metal Solution servers from the jump
host VM instance.
After you are connected to your servers, validate the configuration
of your Bare Metal Solution order.
Before you begin
To connect to and configure your Bare Metal Solution environment, you need:
A Google Cloud project with billing enabled. You can create a
project on the project selector page
in the Google Cloud console.
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. This is the VPC
network that you named when you placed your order for Bare Metal Solution.
If you need to create the VPC network, see Using VPC networks .
The following information that is provided to you by Google Cloud
when your Bare Metal Solution is ready:
The IP addresses of your bare-metal servers.
The temporary passwords for each of your bare-metal servers.
Create the VLAN attachments for the Cloud Interconnect connection
To access your Bare Metal Solution server, you need to create and set up
VLAN attachments (also known as InterconnectAttachments ) in the same
region as your server. A VLAN attachment is a logical object in
Cloud Interconnect that is used to connect your Bare Metal Solution
environment to Google Cloud.
Note: VLAN attachment is not the same as a client network or private network
used inside the Bare Metal Solution environment.
We recommend creating VLAN attachments in redundant pairs for high availability.
The primary VLAN attachment and the secondary VLAN attachment of a pair are each
provisioned in a separate EAD (Edge Availability Domain)
in separate hardware and physical racks. This ensures high availability during
events, such as maintenance.
A single VLAN attachment supports a maximum speed of 10 Gbps. A pair of VLAN
attachments (that is, the primary and the secondary VLAN attachments) can
support a maximum speed of 20 Gbps. To achieve higher throughput between your
Bare Metal Solution environment and VPC network, you can configure
multiple VLAN attachment pairs.
To make one VLAN attachment preferable over others, you can
update the base route priority on the Cloud Router.
After creating the VLAN attachments, you need to pre-activate them and add them
to your Bare Metal Solution VRF .
To create and set up your VLAN attachments, follow these steps:
Console
If you don't already have a Cloud Router
in your Bare Metal Solution network and region, create a Cloud Router
to connect your Bare Metal Solution environment with your
VPC network.
You can use a single Cloud Router for the both VLAN attachments or
separate Cloud Routers for each VLAN attachment.
For peering with Bare Metal Solution, use Google Public ASN ( 16550 )
when creating the router.
Note: A Cloud Router can have only one ASN. If you want to use an
existing router, ensure that its ASN is 16550 . Otherwise, create a
new one.
For instructions, see Create Cloud Routers .
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Interconnect
VLAN attachments page.
Go to VLAN attachments
Click Create VLAN attachments .
Select Partner Interconnect , and then click Continue .
Select I already have a service provider .
Select Create a redundant pair of VLAN attachments .
Both VLAN attachments can serve traffic, and you can route the traffic to load-balance between them. If one attachment goes down (for example,
during scheduled maintenance), then the other attachment continues to
serve traffic. For more information, see
Redundancy and SLA .
In the Network field, select your VPC network.
In the Region field, select the Google Cloud region.
Specify the following details for the both VLAN attachments.
Cloud Router — A Cloud Router to associate
with this VLAN attachment. You can only choose a Cloud Router that
has an ASN of 16550 and is in your VPC network and
region.
VLAN attachment name — A name for each attachment. For
example, my-attachment-1 and my-attachment-2 .
Description — Information about each VLAN attachment.
Maximum transmission unit (MTU) — The maximum packet size
for network transmission. The default size is 1440.
You can choose between following MTUs when
creating your VLAN attachments.
1440
1460
1500
8896
Note: VLAN attachment for Bare Metal Solution does not supports
jumbo frame (8896). We recommend you to configure standard MTU (1500)
consistent between BMS network segments
(BMS Client Network, VLAN attachment, VPC Network, On-premises network)
Click OK .
On the VLAN attachments page, the VLAN attachment status shows
waiting for service provider . Proceed to the next step.
After Google Cloud notifies you that your Bare Metal Solution
servers are ready, add your new VLAN attachments to a VRF by following
these steps:
To add VLAN attachments to an existing VRF, follow the instructions
in Add a VLAN attachment .
To add VLAN attachments to a new VRF, follow the instructions in
Create a VRF .
gcloud
If you don't already have Cloud Router instances in the network
and region that you are using with Bare Metal Solution, create one
for each VLAN attachment. Use 16550 as the ASN number:
gcloud compute routers create router-name \
--network vpc-network-name \
--asn 16550 \
--region region
For more information, see Creating Cloud Routers .
Create an InterconnectAttachment of type PARTNER , specifying the
name of your Cloud Router and the edge availability
domain (EAD)
of the VLAN attachment. Also, add the --admin-enabled flag to pre-activate
the attachments and send traffic immediately after Google Cloud
completes the Bare Metal Solution configuration.
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner create first-attachment-name \
--region region \
--router first-router-name \
--edge-availability-domain availability-domain-1 \
--admin-enabled
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner create second-attachment-name \
--region region \
--router second-router-name \
--edge-availability-domain availability-domain-2 \
--admin-enabled
Google Cloud automatically adds an
interface and a BGP peer on the Cloud Router.
The following example creates redundant attachments, one in
EAD availability-domain-1 and another in EAD availability-domain-2 .
Each is associated with a separate Cloud Router, my-router-1
and my-router-2 , respectively. They are both in the us-central1
region.
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner create my-attachment \
--region us-central1 \
--router my-router-1 \
--edge-availability-domain availability-domain-1 \
--admin-enabled
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner create my-attachment \
--region us-central1 \
--router my-router-2 \
--edge-availability-domain availability-domain-2 \
--admin-enabled
Run the gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe command to
view the details of the VLAN attachment.
gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe my-attachment \
--region us-central1

state: PENDING_PARTNER
type: PARTNER
The state of the VLAN attachment is PENDING_PARTNER until
Google Cloud completes your VLAN attachment configuration.
Afterwards, the state of the attachment is INACTIVE or ACTIVE ,
depending on whether you chose to pre-activate your attachments.
When you request connections from Google Cloud, you
must select the same metro (city) for both attachments for them to be
redundant. For more information, see the Redundancy section in the
Partner Interconnect Overview
page.
If the VLAN attachments do not come up after Google Cloud
completes your Bare Metal Solution order, activate each VLAN attachment:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update attachment-name \
--region region \
--admin-enabled
You can check the status of the Cloud Routers and your advertised routes
in the Cloud console. For more information, see Viewing Router Status and Advertised Routes .
Set up routing between Bare Metal Solution and Google Cloud
As soon as your VLAN attachments are active, your BGP sessions come up and
the routes from the Bare Metal Solution environment are received over the BGP
sessions.
Add a custom advertised route for a default IP range to your BGP sessions
To set up routing for traffic from the Bare Metal Solution environment, the
recommendation is to add a custom advertised route of a default route,
such as 0.0.0.0/0 , on your BGP sessions to the Bare Metal Solution
environment.
To specify advertisements on an existing BGP session:
Console
Go to the Cloud Router page in the Google Cloud console.
Cloud Router list
Select the Cloud Router that contains the BGP session to
update.
In the Cloud Router's detail page, select the BGP session to
update.
In the BGP session details page, select Edit .
For the Routes , select Create custom routes .
Select Add custom route to add an advertised route.
Configure the route advertisement.
Source — Select Custom IP range to specify a custom IP
address range.
IP address range — Specify the custom IP address range by
using CIDR notation.
Description — Add a description to help you identify the
purpose of this custom advertised route.
After you're done adding routes, select Save .
gcloud
You can add to existing custom advertised routes or you can set a new custom
advertised route, which replaces any existing custom advertised routes with
the new one.
To set a new custom advertised route for a default IP range, use the
--set-advertisement-ranges flag:
gcloud compute routers update-bgp-peer router-name \
--peer-name bgp-session-name \
--advertisement-mode custom \
--set-advertisement-ranges 0.0.0.0/0
To append the default IP range to existing ones, use the
--add-advertisement-ranges flag. Note that this flag requires the
Cloud Router's advertisement mode to already be set to custom .
The following example, adds the 0.0.0.0/0 custom IP to the
Cloud Router's advertisements:
gcloud compute routers update-bgp-peer router-name \
--peer-name bgp-session-name \
--add-advertisement-ranges 0.0.0.0/0
Optionally, set the VPC Network Dynamic Routing Mode to global
If you have Bare Metal Solution servers in two different regions, consider
enabling global routing mode on the VPC network to have your
Bare Metal Solution regions talk to each other directly over the
VPC network.
The global routing mode is also needed to enable communications between
an on-premises environment that is connected to one Google Cloud region
and a Bare Metal Solution environment in another Google Cloud region.
To set the global routing mode, see
Set routing and best path selection modes .
VPC firewall setup
New VPC networks come with active default firewall
rules that restrict most traffic in the VPC network.
To connect to your Bare Metal Solution environment, network traffic must be
enabled between:
Your Bare Metal Solution environment and network destinations
on Google Cloud.
Your local environment and your resources on Google Cloud, such as
any jump host VM instance you might use to connect to your Bare Metal Solution
environment.
Within your Bare Metal Solution environment, if you need to control network
traffic between the bare-metal servers or between the servers and
destinations not on Google Cloud, you need to implement a
control mechanism yourself.
To create a firewall rule in your VPC network
on Google Cloud:
Console
Go to the Firewall rules page:
Go to Firewall rules
Click Create firewall rule .
Define the firewall rule.
Name the firewall rule.
In the Network field, select the network where your VM is
located.
In the Targets field, specify either Specified target tags
or Specified service account .
Specify the target network tag or service account in the appropriate
fields.
In the Source filter field, specify IP ranges to allow
incoming traffic from your Bare Metal Solution environment.
In the Source IP ranges field, specify the IP addresses of
the servers or devices in your Bare Metal Solution environment.
In the Protocols and ports section, specify the protocols
and ports that are required in your environment.
Click Create .
gcloud
The following command creates a firewall rule that defines the source by
using an IP range and the target by using the network tag of an instance.
Modify the command for your environment as necessary.
gcloud compute firewall-rules create rule-name \
--project= your-project-id \
--direction=INGRESS \
--priority=1000 \
--network= your-network-name \
--action=ALLOW \
--rules= protocol:port \
--source-ranges= ip-range \
--target-tags= instance-network-tag
For more information about creating firewall rules, see Creating firewall rules .
Connecting to your bare-metal server
The servers in your Bare Metal Solution environment are not provisioned
with external IP addresses.
After you have created a firewall rule to allow traffic into your
VPC network from the Bare Metal Solution environment,
you can connect to your server by using a jump host VM instance.
Create a jump host VM instance on Google Cloud
To quickly connect to your bare-metal servers, create a
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) to use as a jump host.
Create the VM in the same Google Cloud region as your Bare Metal Solution environment.
If you need a more secure connection method, see
Connect using a bastion host .
To create a jump host VM instance, choose the instructions below based on the
operating system you are using in your Bare Metal Solution environment.
For more information about creating Compute Engine VM instances,
see Creating and starting a VM instance .
Linux
Create a virtual machine instance
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page:
Go to the VM Instances page
Click Create instance .
In the Name field, specify a name for the VM instance.
Under Region , select the region of your Bare Metal Solution
environment.
In the Boot disk section, click Change .
In the Operating systems field, select an OS of your choice.
In the Version field, select the OS version.
Click Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy to
expand the section.
Click Networking to display the networking options.
Optionally, under Network tags , define one or more network tags
for the instance.
Under Network interfaces , confirm that the proper
VPC network is displayed.
Click Create .
Allow a short time for the instance to start. After the instance is ready, it
is listed on the VM instances page with a green status icon.
Connect to your jump host VM instance
If you need to create a firewall rule to allow access to your
jump host VM instance, see Firewall setup .
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page:
Go to the VM Instances page
In the list of VM instances, click SSH in the row that contains your jump
host.
You now have a terminal window with your jump host VM instance, from which you
can connect to your bare-metal server by using SSH.
Logging in to a Bare Metal Solution server for the first time
Linux
Connect to your jump host VM instance .
On the jump host VM instance, open a command-line terminal and confirm
that you can reach your Bare Metal Solution server:
ping bare-metal-ip
If your ping is unsuccessful, check and correct the following:
Your VLAN attachments are active with a Status of Up . See
Create the VLAN attachments for the Cloud Interconnect
connection .
Your VLAN attachments include a custom advertised route of 0.0.0.0/0 .
See Add a custom advertised route for a default IP range to your BGP
sessions .
Your VPC includes a firewall rule that
allows access from the IP address range that you are using in the
Bare Metal Solution environment for communication with the
Google Cloud environment. See VPC firewall
setup .
From the jump host VM instance, SSH into the Bare Metal Solution server by
using the customeradmin user ID and the IP address of the server:
ssh customeradmin@ bare-metal-ip
When prompted, enter the password provided to you by Google Cloud.
On first login, you are required to change the password for your
Bare Metal Solution server.
Set a new password and store it in a safe location. After resetting the
password, the server logs you out automatically.
Log back into the Bare Metal Solution server using the customeradmin
user ID and your new password:
ssh customeradmin@ bare-metal-ip
We recommend that you also change the root user password. Start by
logging in as the root user:
sudo su -
To change the root password, issue the passwd command and follow the
prompts:
passwd
To return to the customeradmin user prompt, exit the root user prompt:
exit
Remember to store your passwords in a safe place for recovery purposes.
Confirm that your server configuration matches your order. The
things to check include:
The server configuration, including the number and type of CPUs,
the sockets, and the memory.
The operating system or hypervisor software, including vendor and
version.
The storage, including type and amount.
Set up access to the public internet
Bare Metal Solution doesn't come with access to the internet. You can choose
from the following methods to set up access depending on various factors,
including your business requirements and existing infrastructure:
Note: Cloud NAT feature doesn't support transitive endpoints thus it can not be used standalone to provide the internet access to the BMS server. Compute Engine VM must be used along with Cloud NAT.
Access internet using a Compute Engine VM as a Proxy VM server .
Routing traffic through a Compute Engine VM that serves as a proxy
server.
You can use a Compute Engine VM in the following ways to route the traffic:
Method 1: Access internet using a Compute Engine VM and Cloud NAT .
Method 2: Access internet using redundant Compute Engine VMs, Cloud NAT, internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, and policy-based routing .
Method 3: Access internet using redundant Compute Engine VMs, Cloud NAT, internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, and policy-based routing in a separate VPC .
Routing traffic through Cloud VPN or Dedicated Interconnect to on-premises gateways to the internet.
Note: Make sure the cloud router is advertising the custom default route (0.0.0.0/0) towards your Bare Metal Solution for successful internet routing.
Access internet using a Compute Engine VM and Cloud NAT
The following instructions set up a NAT gateway on a Compute Engine
VM to connect the servers in a Bare Metal Solution environment to the internet
for purposes such as receiving software updates.
The instructions use the default internet gateway of your VPC
network to access the internet.
The Linux commands that are shown in the following
instructions are for the Debian operating system. If you use a different
operating system, the commands you need to use might also be different.
Important: For security reasons, such as to avoid exposing the VM to the
internet, we recommend using the VM with [Cloud NAT] instead of an external IP address directly assigned to the VM.
In the VPC network that you are using with your
Bare Metal Solution environment, perform the following steps:
Open the Cloud Shell:
Go to the Cloud Shell
Create and configure a Compute Engine VM to serve as a NAT gateway.
Create a VM:
gcloud compute instances create instance-name \
--machine-type= machine-type-name \
--network vpc-network-name \
--subnet= subnet-name \
--can-ip-forward \
--zone= your-zone \
--image-family= os-image-family-name \
--image-project= os-image-project \
--tags= natgw-network-tag \
--service-account= optional-service-account-email
In later steps, you use the network tag that you define in this step to
route traffic to this VM.
If you don't specify a service account, remove the --service-account=
flag. Compute Engine uses the default service account of
the project.
Create a Cloud NAT for VM internet access
Instructions to create a Cloud NAT for the VM - HERE
SSH into the NAT gateway VM and configure the iptables:
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING \
-o $(/bin/ip -o -4 route show to default | awk '{print $5}') -j MASQUERADE
The first sudo command tells the kernel that you want to allow IP
forwarding. The second sudo command masquerades packets received
from internal instances as if they were sent from the NAT gateway instance.
Check the iptables:
$ sudo iptables -v -L -t nat
To retain your NAT gateway settings across a reboot, execute the
following commands on the NAT gateway VM:
$ sudo -i
$ echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" > /etc/sysctl.d/70-natgw.conf
$ apt-get install iptables-persistent
$ exit
In Cloud Shell, create a route to 0.0.0.0/0 with the
default internet gateway as the
next hop. Specify the network tag that you defined in the previous step
on the --tags argument. Assign the route a higher priority than
any other default route.
gcloud compute routes create default-internet-gateway-route-name \
--destination-range= 0.0.0.0/0 \
--network= network-name \
--priority= default-igw-route-priority \
--tags= natgw-network-tag , default-igw-tags \
--next-hop-gateway=default-internet-gateway
natgw-network-tag should be the same tag as natgw-vm is tagged in step 2.
Your natvm created in step 2 will be using the default internet gateway to access the internet..
Add the network tag ( default-igw-tags ) that you just created to any existing VMs in your
VPC network that need internet access, so that they can
continue to access the internet after you create a new default route that
your Bare Metal Solution servers can also use.
Optional: Remove routes to the internet that existed before the route
you created in the previous step, including those created by
default.
Confirm that any existing VMs in your network and the NAT gateway VM can
access the internet by pinging an external IP address, such as 8.8.8.8, the
Google DNS, from each VM.
Create a default route to 0.0.0.0/0 with the NAT gateway VM as the next
hop. Give the route a lower priority than priority that you specified for the
first route that you created.
Note: If you deploy a NAT gateway in a shared VPC service project, use the --next-hop-address option in place of the --next-hop-instance and --next-hop-instance-zone options, then issue the command against the host project. For more details, see Considerations for next hop instances . Warning: Before creating a following natgw-route make sure that all your existing VMs tagged with default-igw-tags and uses the default-internet-gateway to access the internet.
gcloud compute routes create natgw-route-name \
--destination-range= 0.0.0.0/0 \
--network= network-name \
--priority= natgw-route-priority \
--next-hop-instance= natgw-vm-name \
--next-hop-instance-zone= natgw-vm-zone
Note: Packets should be routed to the default-internet-gateway first so the natgw-route-priority must be higher than default-igw-route-priority in value (lower priority).
Log in to your Bare Metal Solution servers and ping an external IP address to
confirm that they can access the internet.
If the ping is not successful, make sure that you have created a
firewall rule that allows access from your Bare Metal Solution
environment to your VPC network.
Access internet using redundant Compute Engine VMs, Cloud NAT, internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, and policy-based routing
This section shows how to set up internal passthrough Network Load Balancer with Compute Engine VMs
and Cloud NAT configured as the backend. Policy-based routing forwards
the internet traffic to the frontend of the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer.
The following diagram shows this setup.
In the VPC network of your Bare Metal Solution environment,
perform the following steps:
Create and configure a Compute Engine VM and the Cloud NAT to serve as a NAT gateway.
Complete the steps described in
Method 1: Using a single Compute Engine VM and Cloud NAT .
Note: In this solution, two or more Compute Engine VMs can be created and put in the instance group for the redundancy.
A lightweight http server can be used to perform a health check for
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer.
# Installing http server
sudo yum install httpd
sudo systemctl restart httpd
# Testing
curl http://127.0.0.1:80

Update the firewall to allow HTTP port 80 on the VM.
The health check might fail if you don't update the firewall.
Access internet using redundant Compute Engine VMs, Cloud NAT, internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, and policy-based routing in a separate VPC
If you don't want to add policy-based routes for local subnets, you can use
this method to access the internet. However, to use this method, you need to
create a VLAN attachment and a VPC to connect the
Bare Metal Solution.
The following diagram shows this setup.
Follow these steps:
Create a VPC network for the internet.
gcloud compute networks create NETWORK -- project = PROJECT_ID -- subnet - mode = custom -- mtu = MTU -- bgp - routing - mode = regional
Replace the following:
NETWORK : the name for the VPC
network.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project
MTU : the maximum transmission unit (MTU), which
is the largest packet size of the network
Create a subnet.
gcloud compute networks subnets create SUBNET_NAME -- project = PROJECT_ID -- range = RANGE -- stack - type = IPV4_ONLY -- network = NETWORK -- region = REGION
Replace the following:
SUBNET_NAME : the name for the subnet
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project
RANGE : the IP space allocated to this
subnet in CIDR format
NETWORK : the VPC network to which
the subnet belongs
REGION : the region of the subnet
Create two Cloud Routers for the redundancy and advertisements.
gcloud compute routers create ROUTER_NAME -- project = PROJECT_ID -- region = REGION -- network = NETWORK -- advertisement - mode = custom -- set - advertisement - ranges = 0.0.0.0 / 0
Replace the following:
ROUTER_NAME : the name of the router
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project
REGION : the region of the router
NETWORK : the VPC network for this
router
Create four VLAN attachments, two for each Cloud Router.
For instructions, see Create VLAN attachments .
After the VLAN attachments are active, follow the steps in
Method 2: Using redundant Compute Engine VMs, Cloud NAT, internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, and policy-based routing to configure the
internet infrastructure. However, for this setup, don't configure the
policy-based route for local traffic. Only create a policy-based route for
the internet in a routing table of the VPC network.
Note: If the BGP session in an existing local VPC network
advertises a default route (0.0.0.0/0) towards the Bare Metal Solution, it should
be changed in order for this method to work. Only an internet VPC
network should advertise the default route (0.0.0.0/0) towards the
Bare Metal Solution through a newly created BGP session. The BGP session for
local VPC network should advertise only a local subnet including
on-premises and VPC subnets.
Set up access to Google Cloud APIs and services
Bare Metal Solution doesn't come with access to Google Cloud
services. You can choose how to implement access depending on various factors,
including your business requirements and existing infrastructure.
Note: Most of the Google Cloud services that support on-prem environments
can be configured for access from Bare Metal Solution. Follow the on-prem
configuration guide for the Google Cloud service that you want to
configure for Bare Metal Solution.
You can access Google Cloud APIs and services privately from your
Bare Metal Solution environment.
You set up private access to the Google Cloud APIs and services from a
Bare Metal Solution environment as you would for an on-premises environment.
Follow the instructions for on-premises environments in Configuring
Private Google Access for on-premises hosts .
The instructions guide you through the following high-level steps:
Configuring routes for the Google API traffic.
Configuring your Bare Metal Solution DNS to resolve *.googleapis.com
as a CNAME to restricted.googleapis.com .
What's next
After you have set up your Bare Metal Solution environment, you can
install your workloads.
If you plan to run Oracle databases on the servers in your Bare Metal Solution
environment, you can use the open source Toolkit for Bare Metal Solution
to install your Oracle software.
