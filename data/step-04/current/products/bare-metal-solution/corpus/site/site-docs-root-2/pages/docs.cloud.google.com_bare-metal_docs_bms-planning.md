Upgrade firmware
To upgrade your server to the latest firmware version, contact
Customer Care .
We need a 5-day notice to schedule the upgrade. The upgrade requires
approximately 10 hours to complete. We can upgrade three servers concurrently
in a 10 hour window.
Note:
If you are running OVM on your Bare Metal Solution server, the firmware
upgrade requires some OVM configuration changes. For more information, contact
Customer Care .
Also, see known issue OVM server can't connect to OVM Manager after TS54 firmware upgrade .
Interactive serial console
Bare Metal Solution provides an interactive serial console to access your
servers. You can use it to perform configuration and troubleshooting tasks. You
can directly run commands and respond to prompts in the serial console.
To learn how to configure and use the serial console, see
Configure the serial console .
Operating systems
When you place an order for Bare Metal Solution, you can specify the operating
system (OS) that you need installed on your servers. If you need an OS
that does not appear in the following tables, contact Google Cloud Sales .
Note:
The available OS images
receive monthly patch updates that include the latest versions of RPM
packages and the kernel.
Additionally, the OS minor version is incremented when the OS vendor
(such as, Red Hat or Oracle) releases a new minor version in the upstream
repository. For example, when Red Hat releases RHEL 8.10 , the
existing RHEL 8.9 OS image is updated to RHEL 8.10
as part of the patch process.
Consequently, the OS image you previously used may differ from the one
available when reimaging or provisioning a new Bare Metal Solution server.
For enterprises that certify OS images across multiple phases, such
as development, staging, and production, typically over several months, we
recommend to use an OS image explicitly marked with Minor version locked .
This ensures consistency throughout all phases as the OS images marked with
Minor version locked are excluded from receiving the OS patches
updates.
You must obtain all necessary OS licenses from the OS vendor.
Bare Metal Solution uses a bring-your-own-license (BYOL) licensing model.
After your Bare Metal Solution environment is delivered to you, you are
responsible for the configuration and management of your OS, including
applying updates and security patches and obtaining support.
Available OS images
You can request the installation of the following OS images on your
Bare Metal Solution servers. This section provides general details for the OS
images.

Bring Your Own Image (BYOI)
The Bare Metal Solution servers are certified to run only the OS images of the
following distributions:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
Oracle Linux (OL)
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
Any other OS hasn't been tested or certified to run on the Bare Metal Solution
servers.
If the OS image you want use is not listed in the
available OS images list ,
you can use your own image. However, you must keep the following things in mind:
Our technical support
primarily focuses on infrastructure-related issues. We don't provide support
for issues related to OS, drivers, and compatibility. For the best assistance
with these issues, we recommend contacting your OS vendor directly. They have
the most in-depth knowledge to help you troubleshoot.
Your OS image must comply with all the
OS image technical specifications .
Installing BYOI OS image
To install your BYOI OS image on Bare Metal Solution, do the following:
Ensure that your OS image meets all the OS image technical specifications .
Remove any personally identifiable information (PII) from
the OS image.
Open a Google Cloud support case
requesting the use of your OS image. In the support case, provide a secure
download link to your OS image.
Once we receive your request, we evaluate your OS image and provide technical
guidance regarding its installation on the Bare Metal Solution. It is your
responsibility to adhere to the guidance and install the OS image on your
server.
OS image technical specifications
The OS image you want to use must comply with the following guidelines:
The OS image must support UEFI boot type.
The OS image must contain EFI partition and GPT partition type.
The OS image must have a size equal to or smaller than 200 GiB.
The disk format for the OS image must be raw .
The OS image must have the multipath package installed and the multipath
daemon enabled during boot.
The initramfs must contain the multipath module.
The Linux LVM must be configured to scan only the multipath device nodes, and
specifically not scan the raw device nodes which represent individual paths to
the SAN ( /dev/sd* ). It is the LVM filter, found in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf , that
determines the devices to be scanned.
The fstab entries must use UUIDs or file system labels to mount the
file system and not device files as they may contain the SAN Disk WWID or the
device names change when deployed in a multipath environment.
The GRUB must be configured to send the console output to the serial port
ttyS0 at a baud rate of 115200 as well as sending the output to the
regular console or "screen" tty0.
Hypervisors
When you place an order for Bare Metal Solution, you can request that a
hypervisor be installed on your servers. If you request a hypervisor,
you must install any guest operating system yourself.
Note:
You must obtain all necessary licenses from the vendor of the hypervisor.
Bare Metal Solution uses a bring-your-own-license (BYOL) licensing model.
After Google Cloud delivers your Bare Metal Solution environment to you,
you are responsible for maintaining your hypervisor and any guests, including
applying updates and security patches.
You can request the following hypervisor:
Oracle VM
3.4.6
To use Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager (OLVM - a KVM-based hypervisor),
request a compatible Linux OS such as Oracle Linux 7.
Storage
For storage in a Bare Metal Solution environment, you need to select the
type of storage you need, know how to maximize the
performance , and decide if you want to enable snapshots .
Storage choices
Storage devices in the regional extension provide local storage to
Bare Metal Solution servers. There are three types of local storage you can
request:
Fibre Channel-based block storage presented as logical unit numbers (LUNs)
and accessible by only one Bare Metal Solution server.
Fibre Channel-based block storage presented as multipath LUNs and shared with
multiple Bare Metal Solution servers. This option is good for high-availability
applications, such as Oracle Database RAC.
Network File System (NFS) storage. With NFS, you mount a shared storage
directory on one or more Bare Metal Solution servers and access the directory
like any other file system. For information on how to implement NFS, see
Add NFS file storage to a Bare Metal Solution environment .
For Fibre Channel-based block storage, you can choose the following storage
options in 1 TiB increments up to a maximum of 16 TiB for regular SSD and HDD
and to a maximum of 8 TiB for Performance SSD. For NFS, you can choose
the following storage options with a minimum of 100 GiB and a maximum of 16 TiB.
Storage type
Snapshot support
Common Workloads
SSD (solid-state drive)
Yes
Mission-critical production workloads
HDD (hard drive)
Yes
Local backups or archival workloads
Here are some additional storage volume considerations that you need to
understand:
We don't recommended using hard disk drives (HDDs) to run mission-critical
Oracle production workloads, because performance guidance is not available
for HDD storage.
When you provision any Fibre Channel or NFS storage volume, the volume size
becomes fixed and you can't expand the volume. Also, the type and the
performance tier of the of the storage volume remains fixed and can't be
changed without ordering new storage and performing host-based data migration.
If you need additional storage space, you need to purchase additional storage
volumes.
You cannot expand the existing LUNs in a storage volume. Instead, you need to
order new LUNs and a new storage volume, migrate the old LUNs to the new
storage volume, and decommission the old LUNs.
When you migrate the LUNs to a new storage volume, you also need to migrate
the data.
If you run Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM), the following options
are available:
When you need to expand an ASM disk group, you can order another storage
volume, rescan the SCSI hosts to discover the new LUNs, and use ASM to add
the new storage capacity into the disk group.
You can use the following command to perform an SCSI rescan on Red Hat
Linux or Oracle Linux:
sudo rescan-scsi-bus.sh -a
When you add, drop, or resize disks, ASM automatically initiates a
rebalance to prevent an unnecessary load on the production database.
When you remove a storage volume from service in a Bare Metal Solution
environment, the Bare Metal Solution server reboots. The length of the outage
can last from 20 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of your
Bare Metal Solution server and the amount of storage attached to the server.
You can attach a maximum of 200 LUNs (including the boot LUN) to a
Bare Metal Solution server.
Storage performance
Standard SSD Storage
For Fibre Channel and NFS storage, Bare Metal Solution provides throughput and
input/output operations per second (IOPS) performance calculated according to
the following formula for an 8 KiB block size on an SSD drive:
Calculated IOPS = 7200 * Volume Size in TiB
Maximum Throughput (MiBps) = Calculated IOPS * 8 / 1024
The following table shows the IOPS and the throughput for common volume sizes:

Performance SSD Storage
For Fibre Channel storage, Bare Metal Solution provides throughput and
input/output operations per second (IOPS) performance calculated according to
the following formula for a 32 KiB block size on a Performance SSD drive:
Calculated IOPS = 8192 * Volume Size in TiB
Maximum Throughput (MiBps) = Calculated IOPS * 32 / 1024
The maximum volume size for a Performance SSD volume is 8 TiB.
The following table shows the IOPS and the throughput for common volume sizes:

Note: We don't provide performance guidance for hard drives (HDD).
Use the following storage recommendations to improve the performance of your
databases and applications in your Bare Metal Solution environment:
When you deploy multiple storage volumes, use consistent volume sizes to get
consistent performance for databases and applications.
When you add a new storage volume, always remember to rescan the LUNs to
detect the new storage capacity.
Storage volume snapshots
The Bare Metal Solution provides options to save snapshots of your storage volumes to
use for recovery purposes. Snapshots are available as follows:
OS boot volume: Google Cloud takes a daily snapshot by default.
Data volume: You can request daily snapshots when you place your
initial order for Bare Metal Solution. You can also contact
Customer Care
to request data volume snapshots for existing storage volumes.
Note:
Consider the following when requesting data volume snapshots:
Google Cloud reserves 20% of the volume for snapshots. This leaves you
with only 80% of the total volume to store data. For example, if you request
10 TiB of storage and enable snapshots, you receive 8 TiB of data storage
and 2 TiB for the snapshot reserve.
When you place your order for data volume snapshots, you need to tell
Google Cloud which action we should take when the snapshot reserve
fills up:
Delete the oldest snapshot first (recommended)
Delete the newest snapshot first
Take the volume offline
Google Cloud takes snapshots of the boot OS volume automatically every day
at 12:10 AM in the region where your Bare Metal Solution servers are located. We
also take a snapshot of your data volume if you have ordered this. We retain the
snapshots for 7 days, and you cannot modify the schedule for these snapshots.
The following diagram shows the default process of how snapshots fill up a
storage volume.
When Google Cloud enables snapshots on a data volume, we reserve
80% of the volume for regular data and 20% of the volume for snapshots. The
latter is called the snapshot reserve .
When the snapshot reserve fills its original 20% space, the volume
grows automatically by an additional 20%. This increases both the data area
and the snapshot reserve proportionally.
If the snapshot reserve becomes 100% full, snapshots spill over into the
data area.
If both the data area and snapshot reserve become 100% full, the volume
goes offline to prevent corruption of the LUNs. Write operations are suspended.
To bring the volume back online, you need to reclaim sufficient space in
the volume by deleting prior snapshots.
Your data volume might fill up as the result of a high rate of data change
within the LUN(s). For example, an application might write and delete large
amounts of data within a 24-hour period.
To delete data volume snapshots and bring a data volume back online, or restore
an OS boot volume snapshot, contact
Customer Care .
Note: We do not recommend taking snapshots of volumes that you use for Oracle
database files. Instead, take appropriate backups of your Oracle database with
tools such as RMAN or solutions such as Actifio to meet your recovery point
objective (RPO).
Networking
Each Bare Metal Solution environment resides in a secure
region extension that is connected to the corresponding Google Cloud
region by a Partner Interconnect
connection that is provided and managed by Google Cloud.
VLAN attachment pairs are used to connect your Bare Metal Solution environment to
Google Cloud project and to on-premises network.
Choose standard networking or explore advanced networking options
The standard networking configuration for Bare Metal Solution offers a basic network
topology that is appropriate for most small-scale deployments. The standard
networking configuration includes:
Four physical interfaces for each Bare Metal Solution server. We bundle
the interfaces into two logical interfaces called bonds. These bonded
interfaces use a standard networking template to provide basic redundancy
and load balancing.
There are two 25 Gbps physical interfaces per bond interface.
The first bond interface bond0 connects a single client network to the Google Cloud.
The second bond interface bond1 connects a single private network to services and applications running locally in your Bare Metal Solution environment.
By default, bond0 is mapped to a client network and bond1 to a private network created through the Google Cloud console intake form. However, in a multi-network configuration you can create client and private networks in any combinations.
A single Partner Interconnect VLAN attachment pair connects your Virtual Private Cloud to the client network in your Bare Metal Solution environment
You create a Cloud Router before provisioning VLAN attachment pair.
Cloud Router is a distributed, highly available, software defined router in Google Cloud.
You can create and use a single Cloud Router for both VLAN attachments
in the pair or separate Cloud Router for each VLAN attachment in the pair depending on your design.
The diagrams in this document uses a single Cloud Router option.
In the following diagram, VRF is an interface connecting a client network to a VLAN attachment pair. Learn more about VRF in Bare Metal Solution.
We recommend using the following Bare Metal Solution standard networking
configuration for small scale deployments:
The standard networking configuration consist of the following:
A single client network connects Bare Metal Solution servers to the
Google Cloud using a single Partner Interconnect VLAN attachment pair.
A single private network connects Bare Metal Solution servers to the local environment with other Bare Metal Solution servers.
If the standard networking configuration does not meet your needs, you can
consider implementing some advanced networking capabilities. If you already have
a Bare Metal Solution environment and would like to migrate to an advanced
networking configuration, contact
Customer Care .
If you are a new customer and would like to implement an advanced networking
configuration, contact
Google Cloud Sales .
When your order an advanced networking configuration, the following options
become available for more complex network deployments:
Multiple VLANs
Multiple VLAN attachments
Multiple VPC connections
Maximum transmission unit
Network templates
Multiple VLANs
Instead of a single client network and single private network for each bonded interface, you can add multiple client networks and private networks on server bond interfaces.
The additional networks can be the client or private, or a combination of both.
You can add both client networks and private networks on bond1 or on bond0 interface.
You can add up to 10 Networks per bonded interface and a total of 20 networks per server.
Before adding multiple networks contact Cloud Customer Care and request a quota for additional networks. If you already have a quota for additional networks, skip this step.
After you create and attach a network to a server through the Google Cloud console you have the following two options to apply a new network configuration on the server:
Manual configuration
This option lets you configure your server manually with new network interfaces, IP addressing and the IP routing.
Follow creating and attaching a network to a server for instructions.
Through re-imaging
The re-imaging will apply a network configuration to a server. No manual configuration needed. For instructions, follow:
Click the server
On the Server details page click EDIT
On Edit Server page select Reimage server
Specify the OS image .
Specify SSH keys if you are using Public Key Authentication to access the server.
Warning: Reimaging operation can take several hours to complete and it erases the boot LUN of your server.
Multiple VLAN attachments
You can configure multiple VLAN attachment pairs over a
Partner Interconnect connection to your Bare Metal Solution
environment.
This provides more bandwidth between your VPC and the
Bare Metal Solution environment than the bandwidth offered
by a single VLAN Attachment pair in a standard networking configuration.
To configure multiple VLAN attachment pairs, see
Create the VLAN attachments for the Partner Interconnect connection in Bare Metal Solution .
Multiple VPC connections
You can connect the Bare Metal Solution environment to more than one
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in your Google Cloud project.
Note: You cannot use the Bare Metal Solution environment as a transit path
for routing between multiple Google VPC networks.
Maximum transmission unit
We recommend you to use the same maximum transmission unit (MTU) for every network to
ensure consistent packet switching.
Note: BMX does not support Jumbo frame on VLAN attachments.
Following is the recommendation for setting up the MTUs for BMS environment:
Setting up the same standard MTU (1500) for every network segments on the traffic path
Segments: Client Network, VLAN attachment, VPC network, on-premises network.
Configure the MTU on your Bare Metal Solution servers by using your
server's operating system.
For example, to configure MTU on a
Linux server, issue the ip link set INTERFACE_NAME mtu 1500
command on all server interfaces.
To verify the current MTU settings in a Linux server, issue the ip link show | grep mtu
command.
Network templates
You can use network templates to enable a flexible network design of
your choice, such as active/active and active/backup, to meet your needs
for high availability, redundancy, and load balancing.
Templates allow for different combinations of connections
between server interfaces, bonds, and switch ports.
To learn more about templates and request them for your
Bare Metal Solution network, contact
Google Cloud Sales .
Note: When you implement an advanced networking topology, network status might
not appear correctly in the Google Cloud console or in the output of gcloud
bms networks and networking API commands.
Connecting Bare Metal Solution to Google Cloud project
We recommend that you create VLAN attachments in redundant pairs so they can be
covered by the SLA (Service Level Agreement)) . Each VLAN attachment in the pair is provisioned in a different EAD (Edge Availability Domain)
for high availability.
You can use the VLAN attachments in the pair in the following modes depending
on how you configure your Cloud Router.
Active-Standby VLAN attachment mode
Active-Active VLAN attachment mode
In Active-Standby mode, you can use the primary VLAN attachment for
traffic between Bare Metal Solution servers and the Google Cloud project
while the secondary VLAN attachment as a standby.
Active-Standby mode can be configured by configuring higher base route priority
value on the secondary BGP session and the lower base route priority value on the
primary BGP session.
Following example diagram shows the Active-Standby mode with 1 Gbps bandwidth VLAN Attachment.
In Active-Active mode, you can configure to load share between both VLAN attachments
in the pair for BMS traffic.
By default, the base route priority value on Cloud Router is 100 for all BGP sessions.
This means that all VLAN attachment pairs will be used in Active-Active mode
without any additional configuration.
Following example shows the Active-Active mode with 1 Gbps bandwidth VLAN Attachment.
We recommend you not to put a traffic more than the bandwidth of a single VLAN attachment when using in Active-Active mode.
For example: If you create a VLAN attachment with 1 Gbps bandwidth, then the total throughput you can get using Active-Active mode is 2 Gbps (including the redundant pair).
But you need to keep in mind that putting more traffic than 1 Gbps could be risky in this case.
In this example, you put 1.5 Gbps traffic on your VLAN attachment pair and when one of the VLAN attachment goes under maintenance or networking event, you end up with 1 Gbps bandwidth available and 1.5 Gbps traffic which will result a congestion and a packet loss.
Following diagram shows the issue where you put more traffic than single VLAN attachment bandwidth.
Setting up a Google Cloud project for Bare Metal Solution (Internet, secure access)
You can optionally launch the following VMs on their Google Cloud project project
for their Bare Metal Solution.
NATVM
A Virtual Machine for providing Internet access to Bare Metal Solution servers.
See Internet Access solution for Bare Metal Solution
for configuring the internet access for Bare Metal Solution servers.
JumpVM
A Virtual Machine for providing secure remote access to Bare Metal Solution servers
from the public internet
If you have a Cloud Interconnect (Partner or Dedicated interconnect)
or a Cloud VPN connecting your on-premises network directly to Google Cloud project,
you can connect from on-premises network to BMS directly without jumpVMs.
The following diagram shows an example setup of NATVMs and JumpVMs.
For redundancy, the regional Instance groups have been used with multi-zonal deployment along with
internal passthrough load balancers. For more information about regional
resources, see
Global, regional, and zonal resources .
If you don't need highly available and scalable NATVMs or JumpVMs
then a single instance for jumpVM and NATVM services can be launched and used.
This will eliminate the need for Load Balancers.
NATVMs and JumpVMs are placed in their own subnets.
The diagram shows three different traffic flows:
Green flow
On-premises network -> Cloud Interconnect ( or cloud VPN) -> Partner Interconnect to BMS -> BMS server
Red flow
BMS server -> Partner Interconnect -> NATVM -> Internet
Blue flow
Remote or Home offices -> Public Internet -> JumpVMs -> BMS server
Partner Interconnect for Bare Metal Solution
The connection between your Google Cloud environment and your
Bare Metal Solution environment uses the Partner Interconnect
framework.
For more information about the Partner Interconnect framework,
see the Partner Interconnect
documentation, but keep in mind the following differences applicable in
the context of Bare Metal Solution:
This connection to the Bare Metal Solution environment is not subject to the pricing
model that the Partner Interconnect product uses. For more
information about the pricing model, talk to your Google Cloud
Sales representative.
Note: You do not have to order or manage physical connections to your
Bare Metal Solution instances. Google Cloud manages them for you.
Define your own IP address spaces
You can use your own IP subnets in the Bare Metal Solution environment. This
lets you to fit your
Bare Metal Solution into any existing IP address schema that your
enterprise might have.
When you place an order for Bare Metal Solution, you provide two internal
IP address ranges: a client IP address range for communication between your
Google Cloud and Bare Metal Solution environments, and a private IP
address range used for accessing services and devices within the
Bare Metal Solution environment.
You can also select the specific IP addresses to use with each server. Consider
the following guidelines:
Make sure that no existing IP addresses in your VPC network
or your extended on-premises network
conflict with the IP ranges that you use for Bare Metal Solution environment.
For every subnetwork that you request for Bare Metal Solution,
Google Cloud reserves five IP addresses from the subnet range for
administration purposes. These include the network address, the broadcast
address, and the last three usable addresses in the range. For example, if you
request the 100.64.0.0/27 subnet range, we reserve the
following addresses:
100.64.0.0 : Network address
100.64.0.28 , 100.64.0.29 , and 100.64.0.30 : Last three usable
addresses in the range.
100.64.0.31 : Broadcast address
Request subnet ranges with at least a /27 subnet, so that you can assign the
/28 subnet for Bare Metal Solution services. Subnets using /29 to /32 do not
contain enough usable addresses for either Bare Metal Solution services or your
Bare Metal Solution servers.
In an auto mode VPC network, 10.128.0.0/9 CIDR block is reserved. See
Auto mode IPv4 ranges .
If you want to connect to an auto mode VPC network, use IP ranges outside of
10.128.0.0/9 for your Bare Metal Solution environment.
Bare Metal Solution does not support Class E IP addresses ( 240.0.0.0 to
255.255.255.254 ).
Multi-region networking considerations
For any outside communication, including communication with services
or your on-premises environments, the
communication from your Bare Metal Solution environment must pass through
the VPC network that you are using to connect to
your Bare Metal Solution environment.
Consider using a single VPC network with
global_dynamic routing enabled if your Bare Metal Solution
environment will require access to other Google Cloud regions to
connect to any of the following resources:
Other Bare Metal Solution environments
VMs in other regions
Other Google Cloud services
Your on-premises sites in other geographical locations
Using a VPC network with global dynamic routing
and custom advertisement mode ,
you can set up a routed environment to connect your Bare Metal Solution
instances directly to your Google Cloud and extended on-premises
environments in other regions, without
any additional configuration in Google Cloud.
Our recommendation is to advertise a default route on the BGP
sessions to Bare Metal Solution. This enables you to:
Avoid having to make change to routes to the Bare Metal Solution environment even
if things change in your VPC subnets or your on-premises
environments.
Keep the routing table to Bare Metal Solution small and allow it to contain
only one prefix.
Note: Your Cloud Router can terminate multiple BGP sessions from different
environments, including your on-premises and Bare Metal Solution environments.
If you set up custom advertisement mode, and want them to apply only to your
Bare Metal Solution environment, use custom advertised routes at the BGP
session level instead of the Cloud Router level, as detailed in Setting
up the Bare Metal Solution environment .
Network services and your Bare Metal Solution environment
As described earlier, Google Cloud recommends that you advertise a
single default route to your Bare Metal Solution environment to keep the
routing table simple. However, if your circumstances don't allow that,
the routes that you need to expose to your Bare Metal Solution environment are
determined by networks and services in your Google Cloud or on-premises
environments that need access to the devices or applications in your
Bare Metal Solution environment and vice-versa.
Some services that might require routes include NTP servers, DNS servers,
LDAP servers, logging services, monitoring services, and so forth,
as well as any other workloads and applications
that need to communicate with the Bare Metal Solution environment.
Bare Metal Solution does not come with internet access. If you need to,
you can setup routing to access the internet through any existing internet
gateways that you have, either on Google Cloud or on premises.
Keeping routing simple
Outside of the other servers in the same Bare Metal Solution region,
your servers likely need to communicate with one or more of the following:
Your endpoints in your Google Cloud environment
Your extended on-premises environment through your Google Cloud
environment
Your servers in Bare Metal Solution environments in other regions through
your Google Cloud environment
The internet through your Google Cloud environment
Note:
For simplicity and flexibility, we recommend configuring custom
advertisement mode with a default route (0.0.0.0/0).
Your Cloud Router can terminate multiple BGP sessions from
different environments, including your on-premises and Bare Metal Solution
environments. To apply custom advertised routes only to your
Bare Metal Solution environment, use them at the BGP session level.
Firewalls and the Bare Metal Solution environment
When planning your firewall implementation for the Bare Metal Solution
environment, there are a couple things to consider.
If you need to control traffic between the servers or applications within
the Bare Metal Solution environment (east-west traffic), ask your
Google Cloud sales representative for the available options.
In your VPC network on Google Cloud, you need to
create firewall rules that allow incoming connections from the
Bare Metal Solution environment.
Note: VPC firewalls do not apply to any traffic
that transits your Google Cloud environment between, for example,
your Bare Metal Solution
environments and your other Bare Metal Solution or extended on-premises
environments.
Required networking information for your Bare Metal Solution order
When you submit a Bare Metal Solution order, include the following networking
information:
The Google Cloud project ID that you are using with your
Bare Metal Solution environment.
The IP ranges that you intend to use in your Bare Metal Solution
environment. For example, the client IP address range used for communication
between your Google Cloud and Bare Metal Solution environments, and the
private IP address range used for services and devices within the
Bare Metal Solution environment.
The number of VLANs you need in your Bare Metal Solution environment. Keep in
mind that you need at least 2 VLANs for each
Partner Interconnect.
The bandwidth, in 1 Gbps increments, that you need between your
Google Cloud environment and your Bare Metal Solution environment.
Backup, restore, and disaster recovery
To protect against potential disruptions, we recommend that you plan and
implement your solutions for backup, restore, high availability, and disaster
recovery. For more information, see
Plan for disaster recovery .
