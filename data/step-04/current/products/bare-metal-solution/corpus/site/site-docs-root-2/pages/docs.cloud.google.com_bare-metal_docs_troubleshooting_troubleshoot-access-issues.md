Troubleshoot access issues
This page provides troubleshooting tips for Bare Metal Solution access issues.
Check if your question or problem has already been addressed on the
Known issues and limitations page.
SSH client unable to connect
If your SSH client fails to connect to a server, you might see one of the
following errors:
connection timeout or connection refused : The SSH client can't connect.
Permission denied (publickey) : The SSH client fails to authenticate.
To diagnose failed SSH connections, follow these steps:
Test connectivity.
Ensure that the host is reachable and that the SSH port (22) is open
using ping , traceroute , and nc commands.
ping SERVER_NAME
traceroute SERVER_NAME
echo "" | nc SERVER_NAME 22
If this does not work, then the issue might be in the networking layer and
not with the SSH.
Examine the client side debug output.
Turn on the verbosity of the SSH protocol.
ssh -v SERVER_NAME -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
The command prints the debug output that shows the key events of the
client side SSH protocol.
The following example output shows that the
client sent its key, but the server rejected it. The server asked the
authentication to continue with another public key, but the client has no
additional keys to offer.
.. .. ..
debug1: Server host key: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 SHA256:V9cRYdqcAJv+RPfN+oofNTVdUxs6VlocP4uMWOxeGKI
debug1: Host 'bms-server' is known and matches the ECDSA host key.
debug1: Found key in /root/.ssh/known_hosts:1
debug1: rekey after 134217728 blocks
debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent
debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS
debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received
debug1: rekey after 134217728 blocks
debug1: SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO received
debug1: kex_input_ext_info: server-sig-algs=
debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: Offering ECDSA public key: /root/.ssh/id_ecdsa
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
Permission denied (publickey).
If the SSH verbose output does not clearly indicate the
cause of the error message, run the strace command:
strace ssh SERVER_NAME -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa > strace-ssh.txt 2>&1
Examine the strace output for errors related to the core
problem.
In some cases, the client side debug output is not enough to identify the
problem. You might also need to run server side tracing to find the
error. Until you can't SSH into your server, use the
interactive serial console
to perform the next steps.
Examine the server side debug output.
Find the current SSH settings.
grep -v "^#" /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep -v "^$"
To obtain detailed information about SSH, set the following parameters
in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to obtain detailed information.
SyslogFacility AUTH
LogLevel DEBUG
To apply the changes, restart the service.
service sshd restart
At the client side, run the ssh command and extract the
sshd messages from the logs:
grep sshd /var/log/messages
Or, you can export all relevant messages for the time period using the
following command:
journalctl -u sshd -S " START_TIME " -U " END_TIME " --utc
Replace the following:
START_TIME : The start time of the time period
in format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss .
END_TIME : The end time of the time period in
format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss .
Example:
journalctl -u sshd -S "2023-04-25 18:38:00" -U "2023-04-25 18:40:00" --utc
To fix these issues, consider the following steps:
Verify if the client key file is set with read-only permissions (flag 400 ).
Otherwise, the SSH client does not accept it.
To set the read-only flag for the private key that's in use, run the following
command:
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
At the server side, check if the client public key is specified in the
corresponding user's local configuration file ( ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ).
In some cases, the problem might be related to the SSH protocol version or the
SSH algorithm. The server side and the client side debug outputs might
indicate such a problem. Typically, the man pages for ssh and
sshd_config provide the details for maintaining the necessary
configuration. For example, to find the key exchange algorithms or
ciphers that are supported, use the following commands:
# Find key exchange algorithms
ssh -Q kex
# Find the symmetric encryption ciphers
ssh -Q cipher
