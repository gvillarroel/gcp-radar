Prepare for a maintenance event
This page explains the required steps to prepare for a maintenance event that
requires server downtime.
You must complete the following steps before the start of a scheduled
maintenance event. Following these steps helps you minimize maintenance-related
disruptions.
Warning: Failure to complete these preparatory steps before the maintenance
event starts can result in the cancellation of the maintenance event.
Disable the services and scripts that automatically start at power up.
Safely migrate or stop applications and databases that are running on
the server.
Silence any monitoring and alerting associated with the server to avoid
alerting on planned maintenance.
Disable autostart and autojoin functionality of applications and clusters to
avoid returning the server to operation until the maintenance event ends.
Reboot the server 24-48 hours prior to the maintenance event start time.
Reboot is required to confirm that the server is functioning well before the
maintenance.
Power off the server 1 hour before the maintenance event start time.
After you complete these steps, we don't require additional confirmation.
