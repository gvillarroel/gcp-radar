Bare Metal Solution maintenance
This page provides an overview of the process for
Bare Metal Solution maintenance events that require server downtime.
To ensure that your Bare Metal Solution environment remains reliable, secure,
and up-to-date, Google Cloud occasionally performs scheduled maintenance on the
underlying Bare Metal Solution hardware and infrastructure. We perform many
updates while your servers are running. However, some updates require downtime.
In either case, we notify you about the scheduled maintenance and alert you if
you need to take any actions to prepare for the maintenance.
We recommend that you allow the maintenance to be performed in the scheduled
window for the following reasons:
If you receive a maintenance notification for your server, it means that your
server is running in a degraded state and must be attended as soon as possible
to keep it running well and reduce the risk of unexpected failure and
downtime.
Regular maintenance helps keep your server functional over
a long period of time.
Bare Metal Solution performs the following two types of maintenance:
Infrastructure maintenance —Includes the maintenance of the networking
devices and storage components at the data center.
We notify you when an infrastructure maintenance takes place. Infrastructure
maintenance notifications are only informational and do not need you to
respond.
Server maintenance —Includes server maintenance activities, such as
hardware replacement, patches, upgrades, and configuration changes.
For maintenance activities that do not impact your server (such as
replacement of a hot-swappable and redundant power supply), we send you
informational notifications to which you do not need to respond.
However, to perform maintenance that affects your server and requires
downtime (such as DIMM replacement), we need your permission.
To collaborate with you on such a maintenance activity, we create a
maintenance event . A maintenance event lets you view the details of a
maintenance activity and take an appropriate action, such as approving or
rescheduling the maintenance.
How maintenance works
Maintenance takes a lot of planning and coordination. It's a two-sided operation
and requires you and us to work together to keep your servers functioning well.
To complete maintenance efficiently with minimal delay, we recommend that you
read about and understand this process.
The following flowchart shows the steps involved in the Bare Metal Solution
maintenance process:
The following sections describe each of the steps in detail.
Google creates a maintenance event
Ideally, we create a maintenance event two to three weeks before your server is due for
maintenance. We use this event to coordinate and confirm with you to prevent or
minimize disruption to your Bare Metal Solution environment. The event contains all the
details about the maintenance activity and steps you need to take to prepare for
the maintenance.
Note: If we need to perform an urgent maintenance activity on your server,
you might receive less than three weeks notice from us.
You can
view your maintenance events
in the Google Cloud console.
We send you reminders about your upcoming maintenance events seven days, three
days, and one day before the maintenance event with preparatory steps for the
event to be successful.
User reviews the maintenance event
We recommend that you read the details and impact of the event carefully.
After you've reviewed the maintenance event, you can take the following actions:
If you're okay with the proposed window, approve the maintenance event .
If you're not okay with the proposed window,
reschedule the maintenance event to propose
a new window.
Warning: If you do not respond by five days before the scheduled start date, we
might need to cancel or reschedule the maintenance event.
After we receive your response, we schedule your maintenance event.
We do not recommend canceling a maintenance event. But, if you still need to
cancel a maintenance event due to business-critical reasons, see
Cancel a maintenance event .
User prepares for the maintenance event
You must complete the preparation as explained in
Prepare for a maintenance event
before the maintenance event starts.
You must also complete any additional steps explained in your maintenance event.
Warning: Failure to complete the preparatory steps before the maintenance event
starts can result in the cancellation of the maintenance event. If we cancel your
maintenance event, then your server keeps running in a degraded state until its
maintenance is done. Therefore, we recommend that you complete the preparatory
steps.
Maintenance event takes place
We notify you when the maintenance event starts and when the maintenance event
ends. These notifications are informational and do not require you to
respond.
If the maintenance does not complete as planned, we reach out to you about the
issues and next steps, including options to continue the maintenance event or
revert the server to its previous state.
If you are unreachable or unavailable to respond in time, we roll back the
changes and return the server to its previous state.
