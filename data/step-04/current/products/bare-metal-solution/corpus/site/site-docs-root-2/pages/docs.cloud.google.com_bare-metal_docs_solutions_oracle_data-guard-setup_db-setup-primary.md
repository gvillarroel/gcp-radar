Prepare Data Guard's primary database
Data Guard requires a primary database and at least one standby database to
function. Before setting up Data Guard on Bare Metal Solution, create the primary
database .
The following examples are used throughout this guide:
Database unique name
Server hostnames
RAC instance names
Role
DBDG_SITE1
site1db1 , site1db2
DBDG_SITE11 , DBDG_SITE12
Primary
DBDG_SITE2
site2db1 , site2db2
DBDG_SITE21 , DBDG_SITE22
Standby
The Bare Metal Solution servers running Oracle in this guide are configured with the
following environment variables:
Environment variable name
Value
ORACLE_BASE
/apps/oracle/oracle_base
ORACLE_HOME
/apps/oracle/19.0.0/db_home1
You might need to modify the environment variable paths depending on your setup.
Set up the primary database
Log in to the first Bare Metal Solution server that hosts the primary database.
In the /etc/oratab file, add an entry so the oraenv command can set
environment variables for the primary database. Modify the instance name to
match the running instance on each node, and specify the full path to the
Oracle database home:
DBDG_SITE11 : ORACLE_HOME : N
Set the ORACLE_SID environment variable so you can connect to the primary
database:
source oraenv <<< " DBDG_SITE11 "
You should receive the response
The Oracle base has been set to /apps/oracle/oracle_base .
Configure database logging and enable flashback database
Start SQL*Plus, then enable force logging so that nologging tablespaces
added to the database are logged:
sqlplus / as sysdba
ALTER DATABASE FORCE LOGGING ;
Verify that archivelog mode and flashback database are on:
ARCHIVE LOG LIST ;
SELECT LOG_MODE , FLASHBACK_ON FROM V$DATABASE ;
If archivelog mode and flashback database are off, turn them on with the
following SQL commands:
Stop the clustered database so you can make the required changes:
srvctl stop database -d
Run the required SQL commands to turn on archivelog mode and
flashback database :
STARTUP MOUNT ;
ALTER DATABASE ARCHIVELOG ;
ALTER DATABASE FLASHBACK ON ;
ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_FLASHBACK_RETENTION_TARGET = 1440 SID = '*' SCOPE = BOTH ;
ALTER DATABASE OPEN ;
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE ;
EXIT ;
Start the clustered database again:
srvctl start database -d DBDG_SITE1
Prepare the database for Data Guard
Note: This guide configures the Data Guard broker to manage the configuration.
The broker simplifies Data Guard setup by reducing the number of database
initialization parameters that must be manually set. This guide shows the
minimum set of parameters that you must configure to enable Data Guard.
Log in to the first Bare Metal Solution server that hosts the primary database and
set the ORACLE_SID environment variable so you can connect to the primary
database:
source oraenv <<< " DBDG_SITE11 "
You should receive the response
The Oracle base has been set to /apps/oracle/oracle_base .
Start SQL*Plus, then modify the database initialization parameters required
for the Data Guard configuration and services:
sqlplus / as sysdba
ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_FORMAT = '%t_%s_%r.arc' SID = '*' SCOPE = SPFILE ;
ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES = 8 SID = '*' SCOPE = BOTH ;
ALTER SYSTEM SET REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE = EXCLUSIVE SID = '*' SCOPE = SPFILE ;
ALTER SYSTEM SET STANDBY_FILE_MANAGEMENT = AUTO SID = '*' SCOPE = BOTH ;
Check for the existence of standby redo logs in the database. Each thread
must have one more standby redo log group than the number of online redo log
groups.
SELECT 'Logfile groups in thread ' || THREAD # || ': ' || COUNT ( * ) FROM V$LOG GROUP BY THREAD #
UNION
SELECT 'Standby logfile groups in thread ' || THREAD # || ': ' || COUNT ( * ) FROM V$STANDBY_LOG GROUP BY THREAD # ;
The following example has four online redo logs per thread, and does not
have any standby redo log groups created. Since there are four online redo
log groups, five standby redo log groups must be created for each thread:
Logfile groups in thread 1: 4
Logfile groups in thread 2: 4
If enough standby redo log groups exist, skip this step.
Standby redo log groups must be the same size as each online redo log group.
Create the necessary number of standby redo log groups with the following
PL/SQL code:
SET FEEDBACK OFF
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
CURSOR cur_thread IS
SELECT THREAD # THREAD , COUNT ( * ) COUNT FROM V$LOG GROUP BY THREAD # ;
standbylog_count NUMBER : = 0 ;
standbylog_group NUMBER : = 0 ;
standbylog_size NUMBER : = 0 ;
last_group_number NUMBER ;
sqlstmt VARCHAR2 ( 200 );
BEGIN
SELECT MAX ( GROUP # ), MAX ( BYTES )
INTO last_group_number , standbylog_size
FROM V$LOG ;
standbylog_group : = last_group_number + 1 ;
FOR rec_thread IN cur_thread LOOP
standbylog_count : = rec_thread . count + 1 ;
FOR i IN 1 .. standbylog_count LOOP
sqlstmt : = 'ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD ' || rec_thread . thread || ' GROUP ' || TO_CHAR ( standbylog_group ) || ' SIZE ' || standbylog_size || ';' ;
DBMS_OUTPUT . PUT_LINE ( sqlstmt );
standbylog_group : = standbylog_group + 1 ;
END LOOP ;
END LOOP ;
END ;
/
SET FEEDBACK ON
The following example output instructs you to create five standby redo log
groups for each of the two threads:
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 1 GROUP 9 SIZE 2147483648 ;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 1 GROUP 10 SIZE 2147483648 ;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 1 GROUP 11 SIZE 2147483648 ;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 1 GROUP 12 SIZE 2147483648 ;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 1 GROUP 13 SIZE 2147483648 ;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 2 GROUP 14 SIZE 2147483648 ;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 2 GROUP 15 SIZE 2147483648 ;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 2 GROUP 16 SIZE 2147483648 ;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 2 GROUP 17 SIZE 2147483648 ;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 2 GROUP 18 SIZE 2147483648 ;
Verify the standby redo logs are set up correctly for your configuration:
SELECT 'Logfile groups in thread ' || THREAD # || ': ' || COUNT ( * ) FROM V$LOG GROUP BY THREAD #
UNION
SELECT 'Standby logfile groups in thread ' || THREAD # || ': ' || COUNT ( * ) FROM V$STANDBY_LOG GROUP BY THREAD # ;
The following output has four online redo log groups per thread and five
standby redo log groups per thread:
Logfile groups in thread 1: 4
Logfile groups in thread 2: 4
Standby logfile groups in thread 1: 5
Standby logfile groups in thread 2: 5
Exit SQL*Plus:
EXIT ;
Copy the database parameter and password files to the standby servers
Create a database parameter file and copy it to the standby server:
Create a folder for the standby database parameter file ( pfile ):
mkdir /home/oracle/backup
Start SQL*Plus, then create the standby database pfile :
sqlplus / as sysdba
CREATE PFILE = '/home/oracle/backup/init DBDG_SITE21 .ora' FROM SPFILE ;
Exit SQL*Plus, then copy the pfile to the first Bare Metal Solution server
in the standby location:
EXIT ;
scp /home/oracle/backup/init DBDG_SITE21 .ora ORACLE_USERNAME @ site2db1 : /apps/oracle/19.0.0/db_home1 /dbs/init DBDG_SITE21 .ora
Make sure the SYS remote login password is saved securely. If you don't
know the password, reset it .
Copy the password file to the standby cluster:
Get the location of the password file by using the srvctl command:
srvctl config database -db DBDG_SITE1 | grep -i password
The following output shows the location of a password file store in
ASM:
Password file: +DATA/ DBDG_SITE1 /PASSWORD/pwd DBDG_SITE1 .287.1086459663
Make a temporary copy of the password file on the local filesystem by
using the asmcmd command:
asmcmd cp +DATA/ DBDG_SITE1 /PASSWORD/pwd DBDG_SITE1 .287.1086459663 /tmp/orapw DBDG_SITE21
Copy the password file to the first Bare Metal Solution server in the standby
location, and then delete the temporary copy from the Bare Metal Solution server
in the primary location:
scp /tmp/orapw DBDG_SITE21 ORACLE_USERNAME @ site2db1 : /apps/oracle/19.0.0/db_home1 /dbs/orapw DBDG_SITE21
rm /tmp/orapw DBDG_SITE21
Configure the database connectivity
Edit the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tsnames.ora file on each Bare Metal Solution
server in the primary database location to update the net service configuration.
There are three entries in the file; one for each database, and a temporary
entry used during database duplication that you will delete later:
DBDG_SITE1 =
(DESCRIPTION =
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = DBDG_SITE1_SCAN_HOSTNAME )(PORT = 1521))
(CONNECT_DATA =
(SERVER = DEDICATED)
(SERVICE_NAME = DBDG_SITE1 ) (UR=A)
)
)
DBDG_SITE2 =
(DESCRIPTION =
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = DBDG_SITE2_SCAN_HOSTNAME )(PORT = 1521))
(CONNECT_DATA =
(SERVER = DEDICATED)
(SERVICE_NAME = DBDG_SITE2 ) (UR=A)
)
)
DBDG_SITE2_FOR_DUPLICATION =
(DESCRIPTION =
(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = site2db1 )(PORT = 1523))
(CONNECT_DATA =
(SERVER = DEDICATED)
(INSTANCE_NAME = DBDG_SITE21 ) (UR=A)
)
)
The primary database is now ready to be used in a Data Guard configuration.
Next steps
Next, create Data Guard's standby database .
