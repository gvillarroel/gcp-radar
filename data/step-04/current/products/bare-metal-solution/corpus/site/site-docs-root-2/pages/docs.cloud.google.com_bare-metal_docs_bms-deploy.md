Deploy your Bare Metal Solution environment
This guide helps you to activate your Bare Metal Solution environment. Before
you begin, you need to decide which networks, servers, and storage components
from your Bare Metal Solution order that you want to bring online.
You'll enter this information into an intake form in the Google Cloud console.
Google Cloud receives your details, processes your request, and brings your
Bare Metal Solution environment online.
Understand the Bare Metal Solution components
To help you visualize which components you need to include in your deployment
plan, Figure 1 shows a typical Bare Metal Solution environment.
Figure 1: Bare Metal Solution environment
The Google Cloud environment is on the left side of the diagram and the
Bare Metal Solution environment is on the right. The Google Cloud
environment includes the following components:
Google Cloud project —You use a Google Cloud project for administration of
your Bare Metal Solution resources and billing.
VPC —Your Google Cloud project needs a Virtual Private Cloud. Inside the
VPC, create one virtual machine to act as a jump host and one to act as a
Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.
Cloud Router —You need to configure two Cloud Routers to
provide routing and a redundant path between your VPC and the
Bare Metal Solution environment.
Partner Interconnect —This provides a physical
connection between your Google Cloud project and the Bare Metal Solution
environment. As part of the Partner Interconnect, you
generate VLAN attachments and pairing keys that you enter into the
Google Cloud console during your Bare Metal Solution deployment.
Cloud Firewall Rules —Use firewall rules to allow traffic from your
Bare Metal Solution environment to access your Google Cloud project.
Cloud IAM —Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant
Bare Metal Solution permissions to users and administrators.
This guide assumes you've already set up your Google Cloud environment.
For more information, see
Set up Google Cloud to work with your Bare Metal Solution environment .
The Bare Metal Solution environment includes the following components:
Networking —There are three important subnets that you can specify
for your Bare Metal Solution environment:
Client subnet —This mandatory subnet provides access to
Google Cloud and your VPC. In the diagram, we've used
172.16.0.0/24 for the client subnet.
Private subnet —This subnet provides access to other
compute, networking, and storage devices located inside the your
Bare Metal Solution regional extension. In the diagram, we've used
192.168.2.1/24 for the private subnet.
Services subnet —This subnet provides a small IP address
range to offer IP addresses to devices providing storage and other
services. The services subnet is a subset of the client subnet, the
private subnet, or both. You can reserve the services subnet from the
addresses located at the end of the primary subnet range. For example,
a possible services subnet for the 172.16.0.0/24 client subnet in this
example is 172.16.0.0/28.
Servers —You need to decide how many servers you want to include in
your Bare Metal Solution environment, what type, and which operating system.
To see the list of available server types, see
Server configurations .
To see the list of available operating systems, see
Operating systems .
After you place an order with Google Cloud, you allocate the servers
by using the intake form. However, the maximum number of servers you can
enter in the form is limited by the number of servers you ordered.
Storage —You need to select the type of storage you want to deploy.
For more information about storage choices, see
Storage .
Before you begin
Before you start filling out the Bare Metal Solution intake form, do the
following:
Place your order for networking, servers, and storage with
Google Cloud Sales .
Get the list of the Bare Metal Solution resources you ordered, including
the server types, requested storage, quantity, and location. Note that you
can only enter resources in the intake form that match the locations and
quantities that you specified in the contract.
Create a Google Cloud project to provision Bare Metal Solution
resources and submit the intake form. You use this project, often referred
to as the Management Project , for Identity and Access Management (IAM)
and to receive Bare Metal Solution updates and notifications.
Assign
IAM roles ,
such as Project IAM Admin , Bare Metal Solution Admin , and Compute
Network Viewer to the staff members who manage your Bare Metal Solution
environment.
We recommend that you coordinate with your network team to have your IP
addresses, VLANs, and other network information ready before you submit
the intake form.
Set up your
Partner Interconnect, VLAN attachments, and pairing keys .
You need to enter this information into the intake form.
Use the Google Cloud console intake form to enter your selections
Now that you have ordered your Bare Metal Solution resources and are prepared to
bring them online, you need to enter the information for your Bare Metal Solution
environment into the Google Cloud console intake form.
Go to the Google Cloud console intake form.
https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/bareMetalSolution/add
Select the region where your Bare Metal Solution environment is located.
For example, use us-central1 for the Iowa region.
Note: You must provision resources for only one region per request.
Multiregion provisioning in a single request is not supported.
From the Pod drop-down list, select a pod in which you want to
create your resources.
A pod is a unit of isolation that contains your Bare Metal Solution resources.
A region can have multiple pods.
Note: Resources in different pods cannot be connected.
The Pod drop-down list also shows the number of your existing
Bare Metal Solution resources in each pod of the selected
location.
If you're unsure about which pod to select, contact
Google Cloud Sales .
(Optional) To configure multiple networks on your server, click the
Enable advanced networking toggle.
Click Add a network and enter your choices for networking components.
Based on the region that you select, the Google Cloud console displays a prompt showing the
amount of available bandwidth that you can deploy for your
Partner Interconnect connection.

devices inside the Bare Metal Solution regional extension and required for
creating high availability clusters.
Client
If you selected Client network type, configure the following fields:

VLAN Attachments for the Cloud Interconnect connection .
Make sure to Enable and activate the Bare Metal Solution API and gcloud CLI in the project that contains your
VLAN attachments
Selected the checkbox.
If your VLAN attachments are in the same project, that is, you did not select the VLAN attachment's name and project number checkbox, then configure the following fields:
Primary VLAN attachment
From the drop-down menu, select your primary VLAN attachment.

Click Add a storage volume .
Based on the region you select, the Google Cloud console displays a prompt
showing the amount of available storage that you can provision.
You can provision either one storage volume or multiple storage volumes in a
single configuration request. Bare Metal Solution lets you provision up to
10 Fiber Channel storage volumes in a single configuration request.
Note:
You can provision up to 10 Fibre Channel storage volumes and up to 10
NFS storage volumes in a single request. You can provision an NFS storage
only if you are provisioning a server as well. Unlike NFS storage volumes,
you can provision Fibre Channel storage volumes without provisioning a
server.
You can't submit parallel configuration requests on the same set of
servers. Wait for one request to finish provisioning before issuing another
request.
Enter the following information:

your storage volume once per day. Required for custom snapshots, but
disabled by default.
Note: When you enable snapshots, Google Cloud
reserves 20% of the requested size of the storage volume. For example, if
your volume size is 1 TiB, you can use 819 GiB for data
storage, and Google Cloud reserves 205 GiB for the snapshots.
