Deprecated
The sap_hana_ha/template.yaml file that is provided by Google Cloud to deploy SAP HANA in a SLES high-availability cluster that uses a virtual IP address (VIP) with an alias-IP implementation is deprecated.
As a replacement, use the new sap_hana_ha_ilb/template.yaml file that uses a TCP internal load balancer for the VIP, as described in Automated SAP HANA HA deployment on SLES with load-balancer VIP implementation .
The deprecated template and the corresponding documentation, Automated SAP HANA SLES HA deployment with alias-IP VIP implementation , will continue to be available for at least 12 months from today.
