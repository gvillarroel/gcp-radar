For support and monitoring, Google Cloud provides the Agent for SAP ,
for SAP workloads running on Compute Engine instances and
Bare Metal Solution servers.
As mandated by SAP, to get support from SAP and to enable SAP to meet its
service-level agreements (SLAs), you must install Google Cloud's Agent for SAP
on all Compute Engine instances and Bare Metal Solution servers
that run any SAP system. For more information on the support prerequisites,
see
SAP Note 2456406 - SAP on Google Cloud Platform: Support Prerequisites .
Version 3.12 (latest) of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is the
successor of Google Cloud's monitoring agent for SAP NetWeaver version 2,
monitoring agent for SAP HANA version 2, and the Cloud Storage Backint agent for SAP HANA. Therefore, in
addition to the collection of metrics, version 3.12 (latest) of
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP includes the optional feature:
Backint based backup and recovery for SAP HANA .
You can opt in to these features that enable products and services such
as Workload Manager
for your SAP workloads.
For SAP systems running on a Bare Metal Solution server,
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is required when you run SAP NetWeaver connected to any
of the following databases:
SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE)
SAP MaxDB
IBM Db2
Note: Oracle databases are not supported with Google Cloud's Agent for SAP on
Bare Metal Solution servers.
Note: SAP Host Agent, with the saposcol program , is required on any host that
is running an SAP system. SAP Host Agent is installed automatically during the
installation of new SAP system instances with SAP kernel 7.20 or higher. For
more information, see
SAP Host Agent .
You install Google Cloud's Agent for SAP
on the host alongside the SAP system. For instructions about how to install
and configure the agent, validate your installation, and verify that the
agent is running as expected,
see:

Supported features
Version 3.12 (latest) of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP supports the
following features:
SAP Host Agent metrics collection
SAP system discovery
Agent health metrics collection
Process Monitoring metrics collection
Workload Manager evaluation metrics collection
SAP HANA monitoring metrics collection
Backint based backup and recovery for SAP HANA
Disk snapshot based backup and recovery for SAP HANA
Workload performance diagnostics
SAP Host Agent metrics collection
The SAP Host Agent metrics collection is enabled by default for agent instances
installed on Compute Engine instances or Bare Metal Solution servers.
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP
collects and sends all the required information that
SAP mandates to the SAP Host Agent, including metrics about the following:
CPUs, for example, CPU utilization.
Persistent disk storage, for example, disk throughput and latency.
Memory, for example, memory consumption.
Networks, for example, network bandwidth.
Configuration, including information about the host machine and its
environment.
The metrics collected by Google Cloud's Agent for SAP
are determined by SAP. For a description of metrics that the agent collects, see
SAP Note 2469354 - Key Monitoring Metrics for SAP on IaaS Infrastructure .
This feature requires the following IAM permissions:
compute.instances.get
compute.instances.list
monitoring.metricDescriptors.get
monitoring.metricDescriptors.list
SAP system discovery
This feature is at the core of the agent. It collects information related to
your SAP system and the Google Cloud resources it uses, which includes:
The Google Cloud resources such as compute instances, disks, networks, load
balancers from Cloud Load Balancing, and Filestore instances. For
example, in the context of a compute instance, the agent collects
information such as the instance name and the region where it's deployed.
Information about the connections between the applications and databases in
your SAP system.
Optionally, the names and versions of the SAP products used in your SAP
system.
The collected information is provided to mandatory agent features such as
SAP Host Agent metrics collection , other agent
features that you enable, and Google Cloud services that you choose to
use, such as Workload Manager evaluation. Consequently, this
feature is always enabled and can't be turned off.
The following are the configurations that are supported for this feature:
The enable_workload_discovery boolean parameter determines whether or not
the agent collects the names and versions of the SAP products running in your
system. By default, this parameter is set to true .
The enable_discovery boolean parameter determines whether or not the
collected information is sent to Cloud Logging. It's also sent to
Workload Manager if you've enabled the
Workload Manager API
in your Google Cloud project. By default, this parameter is set to true .
The information sent to Workload Manager lets you set up
observability for your SAP workload. You don't incur any cost when the agent
sends the collected information to Workload Manager. However,
there are costs associated with the sending of data to Cloud Monitoring and
Cloud Logging, which is required for enabling observability. For
information about Workload Manager's observability service for
SAP, including pricing, see
SAP observability overview .
This feature requires the following IAM permissions:
compute.addresses.get
compute.addresses.list

On Linux, Google Cloud's Agent for SAP can collect Process Monitoring metrics for
your SAP applications and their runtime states. This is an optional feature that you
can enable after installing Google Cloud's Agent for SAP.
This feature is not supported on Windows.
The information collected in the Process Monitoring metrics helps
you troubleshoot the issues related to your SAP system. In case of issues, with
the help of Process Monitoring metrics, Cloud Customer Care can help you reach
a resolution more efficiently. The data collected using Process Monitoring metrics provide observability for
your SAP HANA high-availability cluster configurations.
Overall, Process Monitoring metrics are fast-changing metrics. For more
information about this feature, see
Process monitoring using Google Cloud's Agent for SAP .
Workload Manager evaluation metrics collection
On Linux, Google Cloud's Agent for SAP can collect Workload Manager
evaluation metrics, which enable you to use
Workload Manager
to evaluate your SAP workloads against best practices.
From agent version 3.2, this feature is enabled by default for new
installations.
This feature is not supported on Windows.
The information collected
in the Workload Manager evaluation metrics help you check the
configuration and settings of your SAP applications, databases, and
high-availability configurations.
Workload Manager evaluation metrics are slow-changing metrics
that are collected every 5 minutes by default. From agent version 3.2, you don't
incur any additional cost for using the agent to collect the
Workload Manager evaluation metrics.
For more information about this feature, see
Workload Manager evaluation using Google Cloud's Agent for SAP .
SAP HANA monitoring metrics collection
On Linux, Google Cloud's Agent for SAP can collect metrics from your SAP HANA
instances and send them to
Cloud Monitoring .
This optional feature of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is the successor to using
Google Cloud's monitoring agent for SAP HANA version 2.
This feature is not supported on Windows.
The SAP HANA monitoring metrics provide you visibility into the performance,
availability, and health of your SAP HANA instances and the underlying
infrastructure. The following are examples on how you can use these
metrics:
You can use the memory utilization related metrics for capacity planning, or
to help manage memory-based SAP HANA licensing.
By co-relating the SAP HANA monitoring metrics with the Compute Engine
metrics, you can identify usage and performance trends.
By defining custom queries that collect custom metrics, you can gain deeper
insights about your SAP HANA instances.
In Cloud Monitoring, you can create dashboards to visualize the SAP HANA
monitoring metrics and set up alerts based on metric thresholds.
SAP HANA monitoring metrics are slow-changing metrics that, once enabled, are
collected every 5 minutes by default.
For more information about this feature, see
Monitoring SAP HANA using Google Cloud's Agent for SAP .
Backint based backup and recovery for SAP HANA
This feature of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP lets you back up and recover SAP HANA
systems running on
Google Cloud, on Bare Metal Solution, on premises, or on other cloud
providers.
This feature of the agent is integrated with SAP HANA so that you can store and
retrieve backups directly from Cloud Storage by using SAP-native backup and
recovery functions.
For more information about this feature, see
Backup and recovery for SAP HANA by using Backint .
Disk snapshot based backup and recovery for SAP HANA
This feature of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP lets you back up and recover SAP HANA
systems running on Compute Engine instances by using disk snapshots.
The availability of this feature varies based on the architecture and disk
configuration of your SAP HANA deployment:
For SAP HANA scale-up systems that use a single disk to host the /hana/data
volume, this feature is generally available (GA).
For SAP HANA scale-up systems that use striped disks to host the
/hana/data volume, and SAP HANA scale-out systems that don't use the host
auto-failover solution, this feature is available as a
Preview offering.
For more information, contact Customer Care .
For more information about this feature, see
Backup and recovery for SAP HANA by using disk snapshots .
Workload performance diagnostics
To help Customer Care troubleshoot performance issues with
your SAP workloads that run on Google Cloud, Google Cloud's Agent for SAP
contains a built-in performance diagnostics tool. This feature is available from
version 3.4 of the agent.
You can use this tool to run the following diagnostics. On-demand diagnostics
need to be invoked, whereas default ones such as the guest OS diagnostics are
run at all times. You can also have the tool run all these diagnostics in a
single execution.
Diagnostic type
Execution mode
Description
Input/output diagnostics
On-demand
This is done by using the Flexible I/O tester (FIO) tool, which can
stress-test the I/O capabilities of storage systems, and also simulate
workloads to assess performance of the underlying infrastructure such as
disks and network file system. For more information about FIO, see
Flexible I/O tester (FIO) .
Backup diagnostics
On-demand
This tests the performance of the Backint based backup and recovery
operations for SAP HANA workloads. It includes testing your network
connection and access to the Cloud Storage bucket that you've
configured for use with the agent's Backint feature. For more
information, see
self diagnostic .
It also runs the
gsutil perfdiag
diagnostic .
Guest OS diagnostics
Default
For workloads running on Compute Engine bare metal instances,
the tool checks whether the guest OS is configured for the optimal
running of SAP workloads. This is done by running the
configureinstance -check command. For more information, see
Configure guest OS on bare metal
instances .
The output of this tool is a ZIP file that contains the diagnostic information
that you specify the tool to gather.
For information about how to use this tool to gather diagnostic information for
sharing with Customer Care, see
Gather diagnostic information about SAP workload performance .
Pricing
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is free to install and run. However, you are responsible
for the charges that result from reading and writing metric data to
Cloud Monitoring.
For pricing information related to the Backint feature of the agent, see
Monthly cost estimate .
For the metrics collected by the agent, Monitoring
charges according to the following:
Monitoring API read calls that exceed the free monthly API allotment.
Metrics measured by bytes ingested, when the ingested metric data exceeds
the free monthly metric allotment.
In Monitoring, ingestion refers to the process of writing time
series to Monitoring. Each time series includes some number of
data points; those data points are the basis for ingestion charges.
For the pricing information, see Monitoring Pricing .
For information about the general concepts in Monitoring, see
Metrics, time series, and resources .
Monthly cost estimates
This section illustrates how to estimate monthly costs for collecting metric data
for metrics charged by API read calls and bytes ingested. For estimating the
cost of using the Backint feature of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP to perform backup
and recovery operations for SAP HANA, see
Monthly cost estimate .
The examples in this section are based on Monitoring pricing as of
December, 2022. These examples are intended to illustrate calculations; for
comprehensive estimates, use the Pricing Calculator .

Pricing example for metrics charged by API read calls
The following example illustrates how to get an estimate of costs for collecting
metric data for metrics charged by API read calls, such as SAP Host Agent metrics.
SAP Host Agent metrics
Consider a scenario where you have some number of Compute Engine
instances that make some number of API read calls each month. The variables in
the scenario include the following:
The rate at which a compute instance makes API read calls.
The number of compute instances.
For this cost estimation, consider there are roughly 43,800 minutes in
a month.
60 * 730 hours (365 days / 12 months * 24 hours)
Assume that a compute instance makes API read calls at the rate of
5 calls per minute .
For one compute instance, total API read calls at the rate of
5 calls per minute
for one month: 219,000 (43,800 * 5)
Consider that you have 100 compute instances.
Total number of API read calls per month: 21,900,000
(219,000 * 100)
Number of API read calls per month after free allotment: 20,900,000
(21,900,000 - 1,000,000 = 20,900,000)
Approximate cost per month for 100 compute instances: $209

Pricing example for metrics charged by bytes ingested
The following examples illustrate how to get a cost estimate for
collecting metric data for the metrics charged by bytes ingested, such as
Process Monitoring metrics and SAP HANA monitoring metrics.
Process Monitoring metrics
Consider a scenario where you have some number of Compute Engine
instances that are writing data from some number of metrics each month. The
variables in the scenario include the following:
The rate at which the metric data is written.
The number of metrics.
The number of Compute Engine instances.
For this cost estimation, consider that there are roughly 44 Process
Monitoring metrics being collected, of which 40 are
slow-changing metrics
and 4 are fast-changing metrics. Also, consider that there are
roughly 43,800 minutes in a month.
60 * 730 hours (365 days / 12 months * 24 hours)
For one fast-changing metric, writing data at the rate of 1 data point per
30 seconds , that is, 2 data points per minute for one month:
For one slow-changing metric, writing data at the rate of 1 data point per
120 seconds , that is, 0.5 data points per minute for one month:
Total fast-changing metrics data points is: 87,600 (43,800 minutes * 2 data points)
Total slow-changing metrics data points is: 21,900 (43,800 minutes * 0.5 data points)
Total volume ingested for each fast-changing metric is:
700,800 bytes (87,600 data points * 8 bytes)
This is 0.66833496 MiB (700,800 bytes / 1,048,576 bytes/MiB)
Total volume ingested for each slow-changing metric is:
175,200 bytes (87,600 data points * 8 bytes)
This is 0.16708374 MiB (175,200 / 1,048,576 bytes/MiB)
Consider that you have 100 compute instances, each writing 44 metrics.
Total monthly ingestion for fast-changing metrics: 267.3339844 MiB
0.66833496 for one fast-changing metric * 400 (100 compute instances * 4 metrics)
Total monthly ingestion for slow-changing metrics: 668.3349609 MiB
0.16708374 MiB for one slow-changing metric * 4000 (100 compute instances * 40 metrics)
Total monthly ingestion: 935.6689453 MiB
Total monthly ingestion for fast-changing metrics + Total monthly ingestion for slow-changing metrics

SAP HANA monitoring metrics
Consider a scenario where you have some number of Compute Engine
instances that are writing data from querying SAP HANA databases each month.
The variables in the scenario include the following:
The rate at which the metric data is written.
The number of queries.
The number of metrics collected for each query.
The number of Compute Engine instances deployed.
The number of SAP HANA database deployments per compute instance.
By default, Google Cloud's Agent for SAP has 12 built-in queries as part of its
SAP HANA monitoring feature. The agent runs these queries once every 300
seconds (the default sample interval) on each SAP HANA database instance. These
12 queries generate a total of 37 metrics. Assume that each compute instance
hosts only one SAP HANA database. Therefore, each compute instance writes a
total of 37 metrics every 300 seconds.
For this cost estimation, consider that there are roughly 43,800
minutes in a month.
60 * 730 hours (365 days / 12 months * 24 hours)
For one metric, writing data at the rate of 1 data point per 300 seconds ,
that is, 0.2 data points per minute for one month:
Total data points is: 8,760 (43,800 minutes * 0.2 data points)
Total volume ingested is:
70,080 bytes (8,760 data points * 8 bytes)
This is 0.0668335 MiB (70,080 bytes / 1,048,576 bytes/MiB)
Consider that you have 500 compute instances, each writing 37
metrics.
Total monthly ingestion: 1236.419678 MiB
0.0668335 MiB for one metric * 18,500 (500 compute instances * 37 metrics)

Supported operating systems
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP supports all operating systems that are supported by
SAP NetWeaver and SAP HANA. For details, see the list of supported operating systems for SAP NetWeaver
and list of supported operating systems for SAP HANA .
Authentication and access
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP requires an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
service account for
authentication with Google Cloud and for permission to access
Google Cloud resources.
IAM roles
that are assigned to the service account determine which Google Cloud
resources the agent has permission to interact with.
Unless you use an existing or default service account, you need to create the
service account in your Google Cloud project and assign one or more roles
to the service account.
Specify a service account
If the agent is running on a Compute Engine instance, then the agent
uses the service account of the host compute instance by default. The host
compute instance's service account
is usually a service account with limited roles that you or one of your colleagues
create, but it can instead be the Compute Engine default service account,
which has broad permissions by default.
If the agent is not running on a Compute Engine instance, then you
need to create a service account with a JSON service account key. For
information, see
Set up a service account .
For more information about service accounts, roles, and permissions, see:
Creating and managing service accounts
Compute Engine Access control overview
Monitoring IAM overview
Required IAM roles
Whether you use a new, existing, or default service account, the service account
must include roles that grant the required permissions to the agent.
Feature
Required IAM roles
Collection of SAP Host Agent metrics
For collecting SAP Host Agent metrics on Compute Engine instances,
the following predefined IAM roles are required:
Compute Viewer ( roles/compute.viewer ) :
grants permission to get and list Compute Engine resources,
without being able to read the data stored on them.
Monitoring Viewer ( roles/monitoring.viewer ) :
grants permission to view Cloud Monitoring data.
For collecting SAP Host Agent metrics on a Bare Metal Solution
server, the agent does not access the Google Cloud APIs, and so it
does not require an IAM service account or permissions.
Collection of Workload Manager evaluation metrics
The following predefined IAM roles are required:
Workload Manager
Insights Writer ( roles/workloadmanager.insightWriter ) .
This role grants permission to update workloads.
If you use Secret Manager to store credentials
such as the password for the SAP HANA database user, then you
also need the role
Secret Manager Secret Accessor ( roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor ) .
This role grants permission to access secrets that are stored in
Secret Manager.
Warning: Giving
Secret Manager access to the
Compute Engine default service account increases the
security risk. Instead, we recommend that you create a
single-purpose service account with necessary permissions and
limit
user's shell access to compute instances .
Collection of Process Monitoring metrics or the SAP HANA
monitoring metrics
The following predefined IAM roles are required:
Compute Viewer ( roles/compute.viewer ) :
grants permission to get and list Compute Engine resources,
without being able to read the data stored on them.
Monitoring Viewer ( roles/monitoring.viewer ) :
grants permission to view Cloud Monitoring data.
Monitoring Metric Writer ( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) :
grants permission to write metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
If you use Secret Manager to store credentials
such as the password for the SAP HANA database user, then for
collecting the Process Monitoring metrics for SAP HANA, or the SAP
HANA monitoring metrics, you also need the role
Secret Manager Secret Accessor ( roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor ) .
This role grants permission to access secrets that are stored in
Secret Manager.
Warning: Giving
Secret Manager access to the
Compute Engine default service account increases the
security risk. Instead, we recommend that you create a
single-purpose service account with necessary permissions and
limit
user's shell access to compute instances .
Backint based backup and recovery for SAP HANA
Storage Object Admin ( roles/storage.objectAdmin ) :
grants list, get, create, and delete permissions for objects in
Cloud Storage buckets.
For information about controlling access to
Cloud Storage buckets, managed folders, and objects, see
Use IAM
permissions .
Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter
( roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter ) , if you
have used a customer-managed encryption key to encrypt your SAP HANA
backups in Cloud Storage. For information about this
feature, see
Encryption options
for backups .
Access to Google Cloud APIs
Compute Engine recommends configuring your instances to allow
full access to all Cloud APIs and using only the IAM
permissions of the
instance service account to restrict access to Google Cloud resources.
For more information, see
Create a VM that uses a user-managed service account .
If you limit access to the Cloud APIs on a compute instance, then:
For the collection of SAP Host Agent metrics, Google Cloud's Agent for SAP
requires the following minimum Google Cloud API access scopes on the
host compute instance:
Compute Engine : Read Only
Stackdriver Monitoring API : Read Only
For the collection of Workload Manager evaluation metrics, or
retrieval of credentials from Secret Manager, the
Cloud Platform access scope must be enabled.
For collecting the Process Monitoring metrics or the SAP HANA monitoring
metrics, the access scopes of the host compute instance must have the write access
to publish metric data to your Google Cloud projects. When you create a new
Compute Engine instance, it is automatically configured with the
write access scope, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write .
For information about the Cloud APIs that you need to access for
using the agent to perform backup and recovery operations for SAP HANA, see
Enable access to Cloud APIs and metadata servers .
If the agent is not running on a Compute Engine instance, then
you need to establish connection to Google Cloud APIs. See
Configuring Private Google Access for on-premises hosts
for details.
Metrics in Monitoring
For the Process Monitoring metrics and the SAP HANA monitoring metrics, Google Cloud's Agent for SAP sends the data that it retrieves from your SAP systems
to Monitoring as custom metric data. To send the data, the agent
uses the Monitoring API, which is enabled by default when you
create a Google Cloud project.
For an overview of Monitoring,
see Introduction to Monitoring .
Find the metrics data in Monitoring
The metrics data from Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is available to view as soon as
Monitoring receives it. To find and visualize the collected data,
you can use Metrics Explorer. For more information about finding the metrics
data in Monitoring,
see Google Cloud's Agent for SAP Operations guide .
For more information about visualizing the collected data in
Monitoring, see:
