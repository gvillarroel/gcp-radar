Version 2
Note: To back up SAP HANA deployments that use striped data disks (where the
/hana/data volume is hosted on more than one disk), contact Customer Care.
This planning guide describes the disk snapshot feature of
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP. For information about the other features, see
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP planning guide .
The disk snapshot feature lets you perform backup and recovery operations for
SAP HANA systems running on Compute Engine instances.
This feature is integrated with the
Data snapshots
feature of SAP HANA, which lets you use standard or archive snapshots of the disks hosting your /hana/data volume to back up and recover your SAP HANA database.
For information about how to back up and recover your SAP
HANA by using this feature of the agent, see
Back up and recover SAP HANA by using disk snapshots .
Monthly cost estimate
You incur charges for the standard snapshots that you create. For pricing
information, see
Disk snapshots .
To estimate the monthly costs for using disk snapshots as backups for your SAP
HANA data volume, you can use the
Google Cloud Pricing Calculator .
Use the following information to help you better estimate the cost:
Estimated full sizes for the initial disk snapshots.
Estimated delta sizes for each subsequent disk snapshots.
Snapshot frequency. For example, if you create one set of snapshots every day,
then the snapshot frequency is 24 hours.
Snapshot retention time.
Snapshot storage redundancy: single-region or multi-region.
Estimated intra-region and inter-region data transfer over your network. For
example, you may incur network fees if you create or restore a standard
snapshot group that is stored in a different location than the source disks.
Limitations
The following limitations apply to backing up and recovering SAP HANA while
using the disk snapshot feature of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP:
You cannot use the agent's disk snapshot feature for SAP HANA scale-out
host auto-failover deployments. For more information,
see Using snapshots with scale-out deployments .
Your must ensure the following for your /hana/data volume:
It is hosted on one or more SSD-based
Persistent Disk or Hyperdisk volumes. These
disks must host no other SAP HANA volume. As described in the SAP Note
2039883 - FAQ: SAP HANA database and data snapshots (storage snapshots) ,
to be able to recover your SAP HANA database, the storage snapshot must not
include the log area of the database.
It is mapped to a logical volume. This enables the agent to correctly handle
the mount point during disk snapshot based backup or recovery operations.
If you're using more than one disk to host your /hana/data volume, then
you can use this feature of the agent only if the underlying disks are
Hyperdisk volumes.
If you have deployed your SAP HANA system by using Infrastructure as Code
(IaC) tools such as Terraform, then the agent can create snapshot based
backups but cannot perform recovery operations. For more information, see
Using snapshots with IaC tool based deployments .
You must perform backup and recovery operations by using the agent instance
running on the same Compute Engine instance that hosts your SAP HANA database.
You cannot use agent instances running on other Compute Engine
instances.
To back up and recover your SAP HANA database, you must grant sudo access to
certain operating system commands either by providing root access or by using
an appropriate sudo group. For more information, see
Set permissions .
Instant snapshots and consistency group backups are not supported if the disks are part of
a storage pool. For more information, see
Storage pools limitations .
For information about limitations of Compute Engine disk snapshots in
general, see
Limitations .
Required permissions
To allow Google Cloud's Agent for SAP to back up and recover your SAP HANA database
by using disk snapshots, you must set permissions for the following:
The Google Cloud project where your SAP HANA system is running.
The user that runs the agent commands in the operating system, which could be
the SAP HANA operating system user, or your own user.
The SAP HANA database user used by the agent.
For information about the permissions that you must grant, see
Set permissions .
Create disk snapshot based backups
To create disk snapshot based backups for SAP HANA by using
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP, you run the agent's hanadiskbackup command. For
information about how to do this, see
Back up and recover SAP HANA by using disk snapshots .
Scale-up with /hana/data on one disk
The following flowchart shows the steps that the agent performs to
create a disk snapshot based backup for your SAP HANA scale-up system
when the /hana/data volume is hosted on a single disk:
How the agent's disk snapshot feature creates a backup for your SAP HANA
scale-up system that uses a single disk to host the
/hana/data volume:
After you run the hanadiskbackup command, the agent does the
following:
Validates all input arguments provided to the
hanadiskbackup command.
Connects to your SAP HANA database by using the inputs provided to the
hanadiskbackup command.
Verifies that there are no existing snapshots.
If there is any existing snapshot of the disk hosting your
/hana/data volume, and if you've not specified
abandon-prepared=TRUE with the hanadiskbackup
command, then the agent exits this procedure and no backup is created.
You then need to manually review and re-run the
hanadiskbackup command.
Informs SAP HANA that snapshot creation has started.
Creates a snapshot of the Persistent Disk or Hyperdisk
volume that hosts your /hana/data directory.
Informs SAP HANA that snapshot creation is successful.
Scale-up with /hana/data on multiple disks
The following flowchart shows the steps that the agent performs to
create a disk snapshot based backup for your SAP HANA scale-up system
when the /hana/data volume is hosted on more than one disk:
How the agent's disk snapshot feature creates a backup for your SAP
HANA scale-up system that uses striped disks to host the
/hana/data volume:
After you run the hanadiskbackup command, the agent does
the following:
Validates all input arguments provided to the
hanadiskbackup command.
Connects to your SAP HANA database by using the inputs provided to the
hanadiskbackup command.
Finds the disks that host your /hana/data volume. From
version 3.7 of the agent, if you specify the
-source-disks argument, then the agent skips this check.
Verifies that all the disks hosting the /hana/data volume
belong to the same consistency group (CG).
Verifies that there is no existing snapshot based backup available for
your SAP HANA database.
If there exists a snapshot based backup for your database, and if
you've not specified abandon-prepared=TRUE with the
hanadiskbackup command, then the agent exits this procedure
and no backup is created. You then need to manually review and re-run
the hanadiskbackup command.
Informs SAP HANA that snapshot creation has started.
Creates a snapshot of your SAP HANA database by using SAP HANA HDBSQL.
Creates an instant snapshot group for the disks that host your
/hana/data volume.
Converts all instant snapshots to standard or archive snapshots.
By default, the agent creates standard snapshots. You can choose to
create archive snapshots by specifying snapshot-type=ARCHIVE
with the hanadiskbackup command.
Deletes the instant snapshot group.
Informs SAP HANA that snapshot based backup creation is successful.
Scale-out except host auto-failover
The following flowchart shows the steps that Google Cloud's Agent for SAP
performs to create a disk snapshot based backup for your SAP HANA
scale-out system that doesn't use the host auto-failover solution:
How the agent's disk snapshot feature creates a backup for your SAP
HANA scale-out system that doesn't use the host auto-failover solution:
After you run the hanadiskbackup command, the agent does
the following:
Validates all input arguments provided to the
hanadiskbackup command.
Connects to your SAP HANA database by using the inputs provided to the
hanadiskbackup command.
Verifies that all the disks hosting the /hana/data volume
belong to the same consistency group (CG).
Verifies that there is no existing snapshot based backup available for
your SAP HANA database.
If there exists a snapshot based backup for your database, and if
you've not specified abandon-prepared=TRUE with the
hanadiskbackup command, then the agent exits this procedure
and no backup is created. You then need to manually review and re-run
the hanadiskbackup command.
Informs SAP HANA that snapshot creation has started.
Creates a snapshot of your SAP HANA database by using SAP HANA HDBSQL.
Creates an instant snapshot group for the disks that host your
/hana/data volume.
Converts all instant snapshots to standard or archive snapshots.
By default, the agent creates standard snapshots. You can choose to
create archive snapshots by specifying snapshot-type=ARCHIVE
with the hanadiskbackup command.
Deletes the instant snapshot group.
Informs SAP HANA that snapshot based backup creation is successful.
If the agent fails to complete any step in this backup procedure, then it marks
the snapshot creation as UNSUCCESSFUL in SAP HANA and exits the procedure. You then need
to manually review and re-run the hanadiskbackup command. To find out why the
agent exited the backup procedure, you can view the entries in the
/var/log/google-cloud-sap-agent/hanadiskbackup.log file.
Create delta backups
When you run the hanadiskbackup command, the agent creates
snapshots for the disks hosting your
/hana/data volume.
An advantage of disk snapshots is that they are incremental, where each
subsequent backup only stores incremental block changes instead of creating an
entirely new backup. This means that after you create the first snapshot based
backup for your SAP HANA database by using Google Cloud's Agent for SAP, all the
succeeding snapshot based backups that you create are delta backups by default.
You need not take any additional action to create delta backups.
For more information, see
How incremental standard snapshots work .
Encrypt disk snapshots
By default, data in Google Cloud is encrypted at rest using AES-256. This
applies to the data stored in disks and disk snapshots. Alternatively, you can
encrypt your snapshots by using either a
customer-managed encryption key (CMEK)
or a
customer-supplied encryption key (CSEK) .
You can also implement an additional layer of security by enabling the
encryption provided by SAP HANA for the /hana/data volume. For information
about this option, see
Enabling Encryption of Data and Log Volumes .
Recover SAP HANA data by using disk snapshots
To recover your SAP HANA database by using a disk snapshot based
backup, you run the agent's hanadiskrestore command. For information about how
to do this, see
Back up and recover SAP HANA by using disk snapshots .
Scale-up with one data disk
If your /hana/data volume is hosted on one disk, then the
following flowchart shows how you use the agent's disk snapshot feature
to recover an SAP HANA database:

Recover your SAP HANA database either to the snapshot time or a
specific point in time, as described in the following subsections.
If the agent fails to complete any step in this procedure, then it exits the
procedure. You then need to manually review, troubleshoot if required, and then
re-run the hanadiskrestore command. To find out why the agent exited the
database recovery procedure, you can view the entries in the
/var/log/google-cloud-sap-agent/hanadiskrestore.log file.
Recover SAP HANA to a specific point-in-time
To recover your SAP HANA database to a specific point in time, in addition to
snapshots of the disks hosting your /hana/data volume, you need the necessary
SAP HANA delta and log backups that you previously created for your database.
You can create the SAP HANA log backup either by using the
Backint
feature of the agent, or a file system backup of your SAP HANA database.
While performing recovery, if you specify a timestamp in the future, then your
SAP HANA database is recovered to the most recent state.
Recover SAP HANA from an external source
You can use the disk snapshot based backups that you created for one SAP HANA
system to recover another SAP HANA system. You can also use this capability to
move systems across environments, for example, from a testing environment to a
quality assurance environment.
For information about how to do this, see
Perform system copy or system refresh .
Using disk snapshots with SAP HANA deployments
The following sections provide scenario-specific planning information for the
backup and recovery of SAP HANA scale-up systems by using the disk snapshot
feature of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP:
Using snapshots with HA deployments
Using snapshots with DR deployments
Using snapshots with scale-out deployments
Using snapshots with IaC tool based deployments
Using snapshots with HA deployments
In an SAP HANA scale-up system running in a high-availability (HA) cluster on
Google Cloud, you need to install Google Cloud's Agent for SAP on both the
primary node and the standby node in the cluster.
To create disk snapshot based backups for an SAP HANA HA system, you need to run
the hanadiskbackup command only for the /hana/data volume in your primary node.
If a failover event occurs, then you need to run the hanadiskbackup command
on the new primary node. Also, while running the command, you must specify the
SAP HANA hostname or IP address of your primary node's host. Don't specify the
SAP HANA virtual IP (VIP) used in the cluster.
While performing recovery operations, you can use the snapshot based backup to
recover
the disks hosting the /hana/data volume in either the primary or the standby
node. You can recover your SAP HANA database to the time the disk snapshots were
created, or any specific point in time.
Using snapshots with DR deployments
For an SAP HANA scale-up system in a disaster recovery (DR) deployment on
Google Cloud, you need to install Google Cloud's Agent for SAP on both the
primary and standby hosts.
To create disk snapshot based backups for an SAP HANA HA system, you need to run
the hanadiskbackup command only for the /hana/data volume in your primary
database instance. If you break the SAP HANA system replication and promote the
standby database instance, then you need to run the hanadiskbackup command on
the new primary instance.
For DR deployments, you perform recovery operations on the primary database
instance. You can recover your SAP HANA database to the time the disk snapshots
were created, or any specific point in time.
Using snapshots with scale-out deployments
Up to version 3.6 of the Google Cloud's Agent for SAP, the disk snapshot feature of
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is not compatible with SAP HANA scale-out deployments.
From version 3.7 of the agent, you can use the disk snapshot feature with
SAP HANA scale-out deployments that don't use the host auto-failover solution.
For backup and recovery in such scenarios, you can use the following options:
Use the Google Cloud Backup and DR service. For more
information, see
Back up HANA 1+n and HANA scale-out databases .
Use the Backint feature of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP. For more information, see
Backint based backup and recovery for SAP HANA .
Using snapshots with IaC tool based deployments
The disk snapshot feature of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is partially compatible
with SAP HANA systems that have been deployed by using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
tools such as Terraform.
While the agent can create snapshot based backups for these systems, the agent
cannot be used to perform recovery operations. This is because snapshot based recovery
by using the agent includes recreating the disks hosting the /hana/data volume, which
can cause conflicts or issues with how the IaC performs state management.
For example, after you perform recovery by using the agent, whenever your IaC tool
checks the status of the disks hosting the /hana/data volume, the tool would
try to revert to your system's defined configuration by either reattaching the
previous disks, or by deleting the new disks and recreating the previous disks. Any
of these actions can severely affect your SAP HANA database, to the extent
of making it unusable.
However, most IaC tools provide workflows that let you modify your system's
state to keep up with changes to the managed infrastructure. The following is
a high-level procedure that you can use to recover SAP HANA systems that you
deployed by using IaC tools:
Stop your SAP HANA database. For instructions, see the SAP document
Starting and Stopping SAP HANA Systems .
Stop the Compute Engine instance that hosts your SAP HANA system.
In an HA or DR deployment, stop all compute instances. For information about
how to stop a compute instance, see
Stop a VM .
In the IaC configuration file that contains the definition of your SAP HANA
system, modify the definition of the disks corresponding to the /hana/data volume so
that they can be recreated by using existing disk snapshots. For an HA or DR
deployment, perform this action for the primary SAP HANA node.
For example, if you deployed your SAP HANA system by using one of the
Terraform configurations provided by Google Cloud ,
then in the ./terraform/modules/sap_hana/main.tf file, include the
snapshot argument as follows:
Note: The following example applies to scenarios where the
/hana/data volume is hosted on one disk. If you need assistance for
making this change in scenarios where the /hana/data volume is hosted on
more than one disk, then contact Customer Care.
# Split data/log/sap disks
resource "google_compute_disk" "sap_hana_data_disks" {
count = var.use_single_shared_data_log_disk ? 0 : var.sap_hana_scaleout_nodes + 1
name = format("${var.instance_name}-data%05d", count.index + 1)
type = local.final_data_disk_type
zone = var.zone
size = local.data_pd_size
snapshot = "hana- SID -snapshot- YYYYMMDD - HHMMSS "
project = var.project_id
provisioned_iops = local.final_data_iops
}
Apply the modified configuration. For example, if you're using Terraform,
then run the following commands:
terraform validate
terraform apply
Recover your SAP HANA database. For instructions, see
Recover the database by using a disk snapshot .
Enable logging
While performing disk snapshot based backup and recovery operations,
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP writes to the following log files: hanadiskbackup.log
and hanadiskrestore.log , respectively.
These log files are located in the /var/log/google-cloud-sap-agent/ directory
on your host Compute Engine instance.
By default, logging is enabled during backup and recovery operations. The
default log level is info . You can increase or decrease the log level by
specifying the -loglevel argument when you run the hanadiskbackup and
hanadiskrestore commands.
Enable monitoring
By default, Google Cloud's Agent for SAP emits the following metrics to
Cloud Monitoring
each time you run the hanadiskbackup command. This is controlled by the
-send-metrics-to-monitoring argument, which has the default value TRUE .
You can set up monitoring for your SAP HANA database by configuring alerts based
on these metrics. You can also view the metrics on a dashboard.
The following table describes the metrics that the agent emits during snapshot
based backup and recovery operations:
Metric
Description
workload.googleapis.com/sap/agent/hanadiskbackup/status
Boolean
Informs if the disk snapshot based backup operation is successful or
not. The value true means success and false
means failure.
workload.googleapis.com/sap/agent/hanadiskbackup/totaltime
Int
Informs the time, in seconds, that the backup operation takes to
create the disk snapshots, including the time to upload them to the
specified Cloud Storage bucket.
workload.googleapis.com/sap/agent/hanadiskbackup/dbfreezetime
Int
Informs the time, in seconds, that your SAP HANA file system was
freezed during the disk snapshot based backup operation.
Best practices
While using disk snapshots to back up and recover your SAP HANA database, we
recommend the following best practices:
Prepare alternative recovery options for your database. We strongly
recommend that you design your backup and recovery strategy such that it
combines different methods. For example, you can use the agent's disk snapshot
feature in combination with a full backup of your SAP HANA database created by
using the agent's Backint feature or by using a
file system backup.
Perform consistency checks for your /hana/data volume and disk snapshots.
Because block-level integrity checks are not performed during snapshot based
backup operations, we recommend that you regularly perform the following
consistency checks by using the hdbpersdiag tool:
Perform page consistency checks for your /hana/data volume. This activity
requires downtime as the tool won't be able to check the data pages of a
specific data volume if there is a process using the data volume, such as
the SAP HANA index server.
On a Compute Engine instance other than your SAP HANA host, deploy
temporary disks sourced from
snapshots that you created by using the agent's hanadiskbackup command,
and then perform a consistency check on those disks. For information about
how to do this, see
Validate snapshot consistency .
For information about the hdbpersdiag tool, see the SAP document
Perform Consistency Checks .
Perform maintenance activities for your disk snapshots. Because
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP doesn't perform any maintenance activities for your
disk snapshots, we recommend that you periodically review them and perform
activities such as deleting old snapshots.
For more information about disk snapshot related best practices, see
Best practices for Compute Engine disk snapshots .
