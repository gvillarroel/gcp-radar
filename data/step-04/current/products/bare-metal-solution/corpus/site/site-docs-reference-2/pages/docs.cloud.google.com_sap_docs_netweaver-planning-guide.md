SAP NetWeaver planning guide
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide provides an overview of how SAP NetWeaver works on Google Cloud, and
provides details that you can use when planning the
migration of your existing SAP NetWeaver system, or when implementing a new
system.
Google Cloud is certified for running SAP NetWeaver application servers
ABAP and Java, and SAP products based on these application server stacks.
This guide does not cover the specifics of deploying the SAP NetWeaver system.
To learn how to plan for your deployment of SAP NetWeaver, see the
SAP NetWeaver Master Guide .
Google Cloud basics
Google Cloud consists of many cloud-based services and products.
When running SAP products on Google Cloud, you mainly use the IaaS-based services offered
through Compute Engine and
Cloud Storage ,
as well as some platform-wide features, such as
tools .
See the Google Cloud platform overview
for important concepts and terminology. This guide duplicates some
information from the overview for convenience and context.
For an overview of considerations that enterprise-scale organizations should
take into account when running on Google Cloud, see the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework .
Interacting with Google Cloud
Google Cloud offers three main ways to interact with the platform, and your resources,
in the cloud:
The Google Cloud console, which is a web-based user interface.
The gcloud command-line tool, which provides a superset of the
functionality that Google Cloud console offers.
Client libraries ,
which provide APIs for accessing services and management of resources.
Client libraries are useful when building your own tools.
Important : If you are using the gcloud CLI,
then make sure that you are using the latest version.
To install the latest version of the gcloud CLI, see the
gcloud install instructions.
Pricing and quotas
You can use the pricing calculator
to estimate your usage costs. For more pricing information, see
Compute Engine pricing ,
Cloud Storage pricing ,
and Google Cloud Observability pricing .
Google Cloud resources are subject to quotas. If you plan to use high-CPU or
high-memory machines, then you might need to request additional quota. For more
information, see Allocation quotas .
Compliance and sovereign controls
If you require your SAP workload to run in compliance with data residency, access control, support
personnel, or regulatory requirements, then you must plan for using Assured Workloads
- a service that helps you run secure and compliant workloads on Google Cloud without
compromising the quality of your cloud experience.
For more information, see Compliance and sovereign controls
for SAP on Google Cloud .
Overview of SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud
In many ways, running SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud is similar to running
it in your own
data center. You still need to think about computing resources, storage, and
networking considerations. You also still need to think through how to handle
backups and disaster recovery for your database.
Here are some of the differences that you should understand:
You interact with the various infrastructure components through services ,
which are abstractions or virtualizations of the hardware that you
would use on premises. For example, some of the virtualized
infrastructure services that you use instead of hardware on
Google Cloud include Compute Engine instances and
persistent disks, Virtual Private Cloud networks and firewalls, and
Cloud Storage buckets for mass storage.
Google Cloud services offer particular features and introduce certain
limitations.
Google Cloud services work together in particular ways.
SAP NetWeaver and the Google Cloud services work together in particular
ways.
The following diagram provides a high-level overview of SAP NetWeaver running on
Google Cloud:
Here are some important things to notice in the diagram:
The system uses some number of Compute Engine instances and persistent
disks. These components host the software, including the main database system.
The SAP NetWeaver system consists of its usual application components plus a
Host Agent component.
The SAP Host Agent/SAPOSCOL component collects monitoring metadata from
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP. Google Cloud's Agent for SAP aggregates
metrics from Cloud Monitoring, the Google Cloud
monitoring solution.
All communication between Google Cloud components and external
components pass through a networking layer. This layer provides security
features, including firewalls, routes and internet gateways, VPN, and so on.
Two-tier architecture
The following diagram shows some details of a 2-tier architecture running on
a Compute Engine instance.
In this architecture, all the components run on a single
Compute Engine instance. The compute instance has 5
attached Persistent Disk volumes, each serving a specific role.
These roles include:
Root disk : Contains the operating system for the compute instance.
Swap disk : Contains the operating system's paging file.
SAP NetWeaver : Contains the NetWeaver installation and the profile files.
Data volume : Contains the database files.
Logs volume : Contains the database-system logs used for
maintaining data consistency, backup, and recovery operations.
Depending on which database server you are using, the data volumes that you
need might be different than those shown in the preceding figure.
Up to a limit, the performance of an SSD or balanced persistent disk improves as
the size of the disk and the number of vCPUs increases. If you use one
of these persistent disk types, create
a larger PD volume and logically partition the disk in the guest operating
system for multiple file systems. For example, if you use SAP HANA, you
can map the /hana/data , /hana/log , and /hana/shared volumes to a single
persistent disk. Using a larger single persistent disk also allows for
easier resizing in the VM and simplifies
management.
Depending on your application, attaching multiple persistent disk volumes to
your VM can have operational benefits. For example, it can simplify the use of
persistent disk snapshots for specific volumes.
Striping over multiple persistent disk volumes does not provide a significant
performance benefit for SAP on Google Cloud.
For more information, see:
Persistent disk performance
in the Compute Engine documentation.
Persistent disk storage
on this page
The database server is also likely to require higher performance
persistent disks than SAP NetWeaver requires.
For example, for a SAP HANA deployment:
The disk marked "Data volume" contains the data files.
The disk marked "Logs" contains the HANA log files.
The HANA binaries and shared files can be hosted on the disk labeled
"NetWeaver".
You need an additional volume for storing database backups.
For information about SAP HANA on
Google Cloud, see:
SAP HANA deployment architecture
Persistent disk storage for SAP HANA .
For a list of the disk drives required for SAP ASE, see the
SAP ASE Planning Guide .
For a list of the disk drives required for SAP MaxDB, see the
SAP MaxDB Planning Guide .
For a deployment of IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (IBM Db2), more disk drives are required than those shown in
the preceding figure. For a list of the required disk drives, see the
IBM Db2 for SAP Planning Guide .
For information about Microsoft SQL Server on Google Cloud, see
Windows on Compute Engine .
In upcoming sections, you learn about details and recommendations for these
components.
Three-tier architecture
The following diagram shows some details of a 3-tier architecture running on
Compute Engine.
In this architecture, the SAP NetWeaver system distributes work across multiple
NetWeaver Application Servers (AS) hosted on multiple VMs. All the NetWeaver AS
nodes share the same database, which is hosted on a separate VM. All the
NetWeaver AS nodes mount and access a shared file system that hosts the SAP
NetWeaver profiles. This shared file system is contained on a persistent
disk that is attached to VM 1, along with the SAP central services.
Certified machines
Google Cloud provides most computing resources as
VMs, also called VM instances , through Compute Engine.
Google Cloud provides bare-metal machines through Bare Metal Solution.
All machine types can:
Run operating systems.
Host SAP central services.
Host SAP AS.
Host database servers.
As you plan your SAP implementation, consider the following:
The number of machines that your implementation architecture requires.
This number can range from one VM for a development, training, or small
production system, to many VMs for a scale-out production system.
Particular machine types , which determine processing power—CPU types,
number of cores, and so on—and available volatile memory.
Increasing the number of vCPUs in a VM instance increases the network
bandwidth for outgoing communications (the egress rate) from the VM up
to a limit that can differ depending on the machine type. See VPC resource
quotas per instance .
Image types , which determine the operating system, and the database type if
you choose to use SQL Server.
The location of the VMs. Compute Engine resources run in
Google Cloud data centers worldwide, and these data centers are
organized by region and zone . You learn more in
Plan regions and zones .
The amount of persistent disk storage and the number of persistent disks.
For most machine types, you can attach up to 257 TB of persistent
disk storage.
Although you can attach up to 128 persistent disks to most machine types,
using fewer persistent disks reduces management overhead.
If you expect high network traffic, as is often the case in three-tier
architectures that put the database on a separate VM, select a VM instance
with enough vCPUs to provide the throughput you need.

X4 memory-optimized bare metal machine types
Note : From December 12, 2025, the naming convention for X4 machine types
has changed to clarify the memory they offer. For example, x4-megamem-960-metal has
changed to x4-960-16t-metal because it offers 16 TB of memory. While this naming
change is backwards compatible, we recommend that you use the updated names for new deployments.

Note: Because the capacity (SAPS)
of an instance of a custom machine type (a custom VM instance ) is not
predetermined, SAP cannot guarantee that a configured custom VM instance would
be suitable to run Business Suite workloads without first reviewing the
configuration. For more information, see
SAP Note 2456432 - SAP Applications on Google Cloud: Supported Products and
Google Cloud machine types .
Regional availability of SAP-certified Bare Metal Solution machines
The Bare Metal Solution servers that are certified for SAP applications
are available only in Bare Metal Solution region extensions, which are not
available for every Google Cloud region. For the full list
of regions that have a Bare Metal Solution region extension, see
Bare Metal Solution regional availability .
Images
When you create a Compute Engine VM, you use an image that contains
the base components you require. For example, an image can contain a
Microsoft Windows Server operating system with a SQL Server installation.
When you order a Bare Metal Solution machine, you also specify the operating
system that you need. The machine becomes available with the operating system
already installed.
For VMs, there are several ways that you can specify an image. You can:
Use the Terraform configuration file
provided by Google Cloud, that is designed to make setting up SAP
NetWeaver easier. For more information,
see the SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud deployment guide for your operating
system.
Use a
public image .
Google provides a variety of public images. You must choose an image that
contains components that are supported for SAP NetWeaver.
Create your own
custom image .
You might want to set up your own base system from scratch and create a
custom image that you can reuse. You can also create an image by
importing an existing boot disk
to Compute Engine.
Supported public images
Compute Engine provides public images for supported
operating system versions in image families .
To see the available versions in each image family, see the operating
system details:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
Windows Server
SQL Server Enterprise
For more information about the support status of the operating system
versions that are certified for SAP, see OS support for SAP NetWeaver
on Google Cloud .
Planning for image management
After your system is up and running, you can
create custom images .
Create custom images when you modify the state of your root
persistent disk so you can easily restore the new state if needed. Plan for
the management of the custom images you create. For more information, see
Image Management Best Practices .
Plan regions and zones
When you deploy a Compute Engine instance, you must choose a region and
zone. A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your
resources, and corresponds to one or more data center locations in relatively
close proximity to each other. Each region has one or more zones with redundant
connectivity, power, and cooling.
Global resources, such as pre-configured disk images and disk snapshots, can be
accessed across regions and zones. Regional resources, such as regional static
external IP addresses, can only be accessed by resources that are in the same
region. Zonal resources, such as compute instances and disks, can only be
accessed by resources that are located in the same zone. For more information, see
Global, regional, and zonal resources .
When you choose a region and zone for your compute instances, consider the
following:
The location of your users and your internal resources, such as your data
center or corporate network. To decrease latency, select a location that is in
close proximity to your users and resources.
The CPU platforms that are available for that region and zone. For example,
Intel's Broadwell, Haswell, Skylake, and Ice Lake processors are supported for
workloads of SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud.
For more information, see the SAP note
SAP Note 2456432 - SAP Applications on Google Cloud: Supported Products and
Google Cloud machine types .
For details about which regions the Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake, and
Ice Lake processors are available for use with Compute Engine,
see Available regions
and zones .
Ensure that your SAP Application Server and your database are in the same
region.
Deploying VMs
You can use the standard Google Cloud methods to deploy your VMs on Compute Engine: the
Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI,
Terraform, and the REST API .
The following guides provide generally useful information about how to deploy
VMs:
Creating and Starting an Instance
Creating Windows Server Instances
Creating SQL Server Instances
For detailed information and instructions about deploying your SAP
NetWeaver system on Compute Engine VMs, see the following:
Overview of Linux deployment for SAP NetWeaver
Overview of Windows deployment for SAP NetWeaver
Automation for SAP NetWeaver deployments
Google Cloud provides Terraform configuration files
that you can use to automate the deployment of Google Cloud
infrastructure for SAP NetWeaver with Linux.
The provided configuration file instantiate the following resources for SAP NetWeaver:
An instance of the machine type of your choice.
Your choice of the following operating systems:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
Persistent Disk or Hyperdisk volumes.
The XFS file system.
For automated deployment instructions, see:
Terraform: Automated VM deployment for SAP NetWeaver on Linux
Terraform: HA cluster configuration guide for SAP NetWeaver on SLES
Terraform: HA cluster configuration guide for SAP NetWeaver on RHEL
Custom VMs and automated deployments
The Terraform configuration files provided by Google Cloud don't support
the deployment of Compute Engine custom machine types.
If you need to use a custom machine type, then deploy an instance based on a
small predefined machine type first and, after the deployment is complete,
customize the instance as needed.
For more information about modifying compute instances, see
Modify compute instance configurations for SAP systems .
Accessing VMs
The creator of a VM has full root-privileges.
On a Linux-based VM, the creator has SSH capability and can use the
Google Cloud console to grant SSH capability to other users.
On a Windows-based VM, the creator can use the Google Cloud console to
generate a username and password; after that, anyone who knows the username
and password can connect to the VM using RDP.
After a user with administrative privileges has connected to an instance through
SSH or RDP, they can add other system users with standard Linux commands or
Windows user-account management. The following pages provide generally useful
information about connecting to Compute Engine VMs:
Connecting to Linux VMs
Connecting to Windows VMs
If you use Linux instances, then you need to plan for how you use SSH keys . In
general, Compute Engine manages SSH keys for you. You can decide to manage your
own SSH keys, but you need to understand the associated risks. For details, see
SSH Keys .
For details and instructions about how to connect to Compute Engine
VMs in your SAP NetWeaver deployment, see the deployment guide for
your operating system:
SAP NetWeaver on Linux Deployment Guide
SAP NetWeaver on Windows Deployment Guide
Databases
You can use the following database management systems with SAP NetWeaver
on Google Cloud:
SAP HANA on Linux.
SAP ASE on Linux or Windows.
SAP MaxDB on Linux or Windows.
IBM Db2 on Linux or Windows.

For information about IBM Db2 from SAP, see
SAP on IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows .
Microsoft SQL Server
You can install SQL Server in several ways:
You can use a public image provided by Google with SQL Server Enterprise. The
SQL Server in Windows Server image is a
premium image ,
which means that the image cost is bundled with the machine type cost.
You can download the SQL Server DVD from SAP, and use the SAP-specific script
SQL4SAP.bat that installs SQL Server with the correct settings.
You can download the SQL Server DVD either from SAP or Microsoft and use the
standard Microsoft setup.exe to install SQL Server so that you can
customize your setup.
If you use SQL Server as your database, you must ensure that SQL Server is
configured to use the SAP
collation ,
SQL_Latin1_General_CP850_BIN2 , for compatibility with SAP systems.
Note: If you are installing SQL Server through Microsoft, during the Server
Configuration step, make sure you select the SAP collation. The Collation
tab can be easy to miss.
You can confirm the collation of your SQL Server in your server properties:
If you have already configured your SQL Server, then you can update the collation,
but you need to recreate the databases afterwards. For more details on how
to specify or change the collation, see the
SAP NetWeaver on Windows Deployment Guide .
Oracle Database
For use with SAP NetWeaver based applications, SAP has certified the use of
Oracle Database 19c or later running on Oracle Linux. For more information, see
Plan Oracle Database implementation for SAP NetWeaver .
For information about running Oracle Database with a highly-available SAP
Central Services instance, see
Linux HA clustering software .
Oracle on Bare Metal Solution
SAP on Oracle is supported on Bare Metal Solution servers, which
run in a regional extension that is co-located and connected to select
Google Cloud regions.
For more information, see:
Bare Metal Solution for Oracle
SAP NetWeaver on Bare Metal Solution planning guide
Database backup and recovery
You must have a plan for how to restore your system to operating condition if
the worst happens. For general guidance about how to plan for disaster recovery
using Google Cloud, see:
How to Design a Disaster Recovery Plan
Disaster Recovery Cookbook
For information about SAP HANA backup and recovery, see the
SAP HANA on Google Cloud Operations Guide .
For information about SAP ASE backup and recovery, see
SAP ASE Performance and Tuning Series: Physical Database Tuning .
For information about SAP MaxDB backup and recovery, see
SAP MaxDB Database Administration .
For information about IBM Db2 backup and recovery, see Backup and Recovery .
As an alternative to native disaster recovery options,
for cross-region active-passive disaster recovery (DR), you can use
PD Async Replication .
PD Async Replication provides asynchronous replication of data between
two Google Cloud regions.
Storage
By default, each Compute Engine VM has a small
root persistent disk
that contains the operating system. You can add additional disks to your VMs to
act as storage for the different components of your system.
Persistent disk storage
For persistent block storage, you can attach Persistent Disk and
Hyperdisk volumes to your Compute Engine VMs.
Compute Engine offers different types of Persistent Disk and
Hyperdisk. Each type has different performance characteristics.
Google Cloud manages the underlying hardware of these disks to ensure data
redundancy, and to optimize performance.
With SAP NetWeaver, you can use any of the following Persistent Disk or
Hyperdisk types:
Persistent Disk types : Standard ( pd-standard ), Balanced
( pd-balanced ), Performance or SSD ( pd-ssd ), and Extreme ( pd-extreme )
Standard Persistent Disk is backed by standard hard-disk drives (HDD).
Disks of this type are efficient and economical for handling sequential
read-write operations, but are not optimized to handle high rates of random
input-output operations per second (IOPS).
Balanced, Performance or SSD ( pd-ssd ), and Extreme Persistent Disk types
are backed by solid-state drives (SSD). These disk types provide
cost-effective and reliable block storage.
Performance (SSD) Persistent Disk provides higher performance than
Balanced Persistent Disk.
Balanced and Performance (SSD) Persistent Disk support PD Async Replication.
You can use this feature for cross-region active-passive disaster recovery.
For more information, see
PD Async Replication .
While you can use Extreme Persistent Disk ( pd-extreme ) with your SAP
applications, we recommend that you instead use Hyperdisk
volumes, which provide greater performance. For information about the
machine types that support using Extreme Persistent Disk, see
Machine shape support .
Hyperdisk types : Hyperdisk Balanced
( hyperdisk-balanced ) and Hyperdisk Extreme
( hyperdisk-extreme )
Hyperdisk Extreme provides higher maximum IOPS and throughput
options than Persistent Disk types.
For Hyperdisk Extreme, you select the performance you need by
provisioning IOPS, which also determines your throughput. For more
information, see
Size and performance limits for Hyperdisk Extreme .
For Hyperdisk Balanced, you select the performance you need
by provisioning IOPS and throughput. For more information, see
Size and performance limits for Hyperdisk Balanced .
For information about the machine types that support using
Hyperdisk, see
Machine type support .
The performance of SSD and Balanced Persistent Disk volumes scale
automatically with size. Therefore, you can adjust performance by resizing your
existing Persistent Disk volumes or adding more Persistent Disk volumes to a
VM. The performance of Extreme Persistent Disk volumes is not affected by size.
The type of VM you are using and the number of vCPUs it contains can also
affect or limit persistent disk performance.
The following figure shows approximate performance numbers for Balanced
Persistent Disk volumes in an example SAP NetWeaver configuration on
Google Cloud. The actual numbers you might see in a similar configuration
are likely to differ for a variety of reasons, including improvements made by
Compute Engine over time.
As indicated in the preceding figure, when the Persistent Disk volumes are of
the same type, such as SSD or Balanced, then the performance that they provide
to the VM is cumulative. Therefore, you can estimate the overall performance by
adding the performance numbers of each Persistent Disk volume.
For example, if you attach two Balanced Persistent Disk volumes
as shown in the figure, one that provides 180 IOPS for read and write, and
throughput of 8.4 MB per second, and the other that provides 1,500 IOPS
for reads and writes and 70 MB per second of throughput, then together the
two Balanced Persistent Disk volumes provide 1,680 IOPS for reads and writes
and 78.4 MB per second of throughput. For more information, see the
"Multiple disks attached to a single VM instance" and
"Simultaneous reads and writes" sections in
Factors that affect Persistent Disk performance .
Note: Disk size, machine type memory, and network usage are calculated in
gigabytes (GB), where 1 GB is 2 30 bytes.
This unit of measurement is also known as a
gibibyte (GiB) .
Persistent Disk and Hyperdisk volumes are located independently
from your VMs, so you can detach or move the disks to keep your data, even after
you delete your VMs.
In the VM instances page
of the Google Cloud console, you can see the disks that are attached to your
VM instances under Additional disks on the VM instance details page for
each VM instance.
For more information about the different types of block storage offered by
Compute Engine, their performance characteristics, and how to work with
them, see the Compute Engine documentation:
Storage options
About Google Cloud Hyperdisk performance
Persistent Disk performance
Other factors that affect performance
Adding or resizing zonal persistent disks
Creating persistent disk snapshots
Persistent disks deployed by the deployment templates
If you deploy the host VM by using the Terraform configuration files
that Google Cloud provides for SAP
NetWeaver, then the deployment automation scripts attach two or three
Persistent Disk or Hyperdisk volumes
for the required SAP NetWeaver volumes or drives, depending on whether you are
using Windows Server or Linux.
File sharing solutions
Several file sharing solutions are available on Google Cloud,
including the following:
Filestore
NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP
Google Cloud NetApp Volumes
To determine which solution is best for your deployment scenario, see
File sharing solutions for SAP on Google Cloud .
Local SSD (non-persistent)
Google Cloud offers
local SSD
disk drives. Although local SSDs can offer some advantages over persistent
disks, don't use them as part of an SAP NetWeaver system. VM instances with
local SSDs attached cannot be stopped and then restarted.
Using Cloud Storage for object storage
Cloud Storage is an object store for files of any type or format; it has
virtually unlimited storage, and you do not have to worry about provisioning it
or adding more capacity. An
object
in Cloud Storage contains file data and its associated metadata,
and can be up to 5 terabytes in size. A Cloud Storage
bucket
can store any number of objects.
It's common practice to use Cloud Storage to store backup files for nearly any
purpose. For example, for SAP HANA backups, Cloud Storage is a good place to
store the files. For database backup planning, refer to the resources in
Database backup and recovery .
You can also use Cloud Storage as part of a
migration process .
Choose your Cloud Storage option based on how frequently you need to
access the data. For frequent access multiple times a month, select the Standard
storage class. For infrequent access, select Nearline or Coldline storage. For
archival data you don't expect to access, select Archive storage.
When you plan your storage options, start with the frequently accessed tier and
age your backup data to the infrequent access tiers, because backups are rarely
used as they become older. The probability of needing a backup that is 3 years
old is extremely low, and you can age this backup into the Archive tier to
optimize costs.
For a more detailed comparison, see
Storage Classes .
User identification and resource access
When planning security for an SAP deployment on Google Cloud,
you must identify:
The user accounts and applications that need access to the
Google Cloud resources in your Google Cloud project
The specific Google Cloud resources in your project that each user
needs to access
You must add each user to your project by adding their Google account ID
to the project as a principal. For an application program that uses
Google Cloud resources,
you create a service account , which provides a user identity for the
program within your project.
Compute Engine VMs have their own service account. Any programs that
run on a VM can use the VM service account, as long as the VM service
account has the resource permissions that the program needs.
After you identify the Google Cloud resources that each user needs
to use, you grant each user permission to use each resource by assigning
resource-specific roles to the user. Review the predefined roles that
IAM provides for each resource,
and assign roles to each user that provide just enough permissions to
complete the user's tasks or functions and no more.
If you need more granular or restrictive control over permissions than
the predefined IAM roles provide, you can create custom roles.
For more information about the IAM roles that SAP
programs need on Google Cloud, see Identity and access management for SAP
programs on Google Cloud .
For an overview of identity and access management for SAP on
Google Cloud, see Identity and access management overview for SAP
on Google Cloud .
Networking and network security
Consider the information in the following sections when planning networking and
network security.
Minimum privilege model
One of your first lines of defense is to restrict who can reach your network and
your VMs by using
firewalls .
By default, all traffic to VMs, even from other VMs, is blocked by the firewall
unless you create rules to allow access. The exception is the default network
that is created automatically with each project and has default
firewall rules .
By creating firewall rules, you can restrict all traffic on a given set of ports
to specific source IP addresses. Follow the minimum privilege model in order to
restrict access to the specific IP addresses, protocols, and ports that need
access. For example, always set up a bastion host
and allow SSH into your SAP NetWeaver system only from that host.
Custom networks and firewall rules
You can use a network to define a gateway IP and the network range for the VMs
attached to that network. All Compute Engine networks use the
IPv4
protocol. Every Google Cloud project is provided with a default network with preset
configurations and firewall rules, but you should add a custom subnetwork and
add firewall rules based on a
minimum privilege model . By default, a newly created network has no
firewall rules and hence no network access.
You might want to add more than one subnetwork, if you want to isolate parts
of your network, and depending on your requirements. For more information, see
Subnetworks .
The firewall rules apply to the entire network and all the VMs in the network.
You can add a firewall rule that allows traffic between VMs in the same network
and across subnetworks. You can also configure firewalls to apply to specific
target VMs by using the
tagging mechanism .
SAP requires access to certain ports, so add firewall rules to allow access to
the ports outlined by SAP .
Routes
Routes are global resources attached to a single
network. User-created routes apply to all VMs in a network. This means you can
add a route that forwards traffic from VM to VM within the same network and
across subnetworks without requiring external IP addresses.
For external access to internet resources, launch a VM with no external IP
address and configure another virtual machine as a NAT gateway. This
configuration requires you to add your NAT gateway as a route for your SAP
instance.
Using bastion hosts and NAT gateways
If your security policy requires truly internal VMs, you need to set up a NAT
proxy manually on your network and a corresponding route so that VMs can reach
the internet. It is important to note that you cannot connect to a fully
internal VM instance directly by using SSH. To connect to such internal
machines, you must set up a bastion instance that has an external IP address
and then tunnel through it. When VMs do not have external IP addresses, they can
only be reached by other VMs on the network, or through a managed VPN gateway.
You can provision VMs in your network to act as trusted relays for inbound
connections, called bastion hosts , or network egress, called NAT gateways .
For more transparent connectivity without setting up such connections, you can
use a managed VPN gateway resource.
Using bastion hosts for inbound connections
Bastion hosts
provide an external facing point of entry into a network containing
private-network VMs. This host can provide a single point of fortification or
audit and can be started and stopped to enable or disable inbound SSH
communication from the internet.
SSH access to VMs that do not have an external IP address can be achieved by
first connecting to a bastion host. A complete hardening of a bastion host is
outside the scope of this article, but some initial steps taken can include:
Limit the CIDR range of source IPs that can communicate with the bastion.
Configure firewall rules to allow SSH traffic to private VMs from only the
bastion host.
By default, SSH on VMs is configured to use private keys for authentication.
When using a bastion host, you log into the bastion host first, and then into
your target private VM. Due to this two-step login, you should use SSH-agent
forwarding to reach the target VM instead of storing the target VM's private key
on the bastion host. You must do this even if you are using the same key-pair
for both bastion and target VMs, as the bastion has direct access only to the
public half of the key-pair.
Using NAT gateways for traffic egress
When a VM does not have an assigned, external IP address, it cannot make direct
connections to external services, including other Google Cloud services. To
allow these VMs to reach services on the internet, you can set up and
configure a
NAT gateway .
The NAT gateway is a VM that can route traffic on behalf of any other VM on the
network. Use one NAT gateway per network. A single-VM NAT gateway is not highly
available and cannot support high traffic throughput for multiple VMs. For
instructions on how to set up a VM to act as a NAT gateway, see the NetWeaver
Deployment Guide for your operating system:
SAP NetWeaver on Linux Deployment Guide
SAP NetWeaver on Windows Deployment Guide
Cloud VPN
You can securely connect your existing network to Google Cloud through a
VPN
connection that uses IPsec
by using Cloud VPN. Traffic traveling between the two networks
is encrypted by one VPN gateway, then decrypted by the other VPN gateway. This
protects your data as it travels over the internet. You can dynamically control
which VMs can send traffic down the VPN using
instance tags on routes .
Cloud VPN tunnels are billed at a static monthly rate plus standard
egress charges. Note that connecting two networks in the same project still
incurs standard egress charges. For more information, see:
The VPN Overview
Choosing a VPN Routing Option
Securing a Cloud Storage bucket
If you use Cloud Storage to host your backups for your data and log, make sure
you use TLS (HTTPS) while sending data to Cloud Storage from your VMs to protect
data in transit. Cloud Storage automatically encrypts data at rest. You can
specify your own encryption keys if you have your own key-management system.
Sending email
To help protect your systems and Google's from abuse, Google Cloud enforces limitations
for sending email from Compute Engine. For more information, see Sending email
from an instance .

Backint based backup and recovery for SAP HANA .
You can opt in to these features that enable products and services such
as Workload Manager
for your SAP workloads.
Note: SAP Host Agent, with the saposcol program , is required on any host that
is running an SAP system. SAP Host Agent is installed automatically during the
installation of new SAP system instances with SAP kernel 7.20 or higher. For
more information, see
SAP Host Agent .
You install Google Cloud's Agent for SAP
on the host alongside the SAP system. For instructions about how to install
and configure the agent, validate your installation, and verify that the
agent is running as expected,
see
Install the agent on a
Compute Engine instance .
If you use the following RHEL or SLES "for SAP" OS images that Google Cloud
provides, then Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is packaged with the OS images:
RHEL: all "for SAP" images
SLES: SLES 15 SP4 for SAP and later versions
Scale-out of SAP NetWeaver application servers
SAP supports a scale-out architecture that uses multiple application servers,
which supports a higher workload.
If you are using Windows Server as your operating system, you can use Active
Directory running on a VM as a domain controller. For more information, see
Setting up Active Directory on Google Compute Engine .
Alternatively, you can connect Compute Engine VMs to your on-premises
Active Directory domain controller using VPN.
In scale-out configuration, nodes must access a shared file system. For Windows
Server, specify where the shared file system is mounted during installation
through the SAP installer. For Linux, use the Network File System (NFS) as your
fileshare on the NetWeaver binaries/profiles disk of the central system
( /sapmnt/[SID] , where [SID] is the system ID). See
the SAP documentation
for details.
For information about the file sharing solutions available on Google Cloud
for SAP NetWeaver, see File sharing solutions .
Migrating an existing SAP NetWeaver system
By migrating an existing SAP NetWeaver landscape, you can leverage your
investment in your existing setup in the cloud. Migrating a system of any
significant scale requires careful planning and step-by-step migration, to avoid
losing consistency between the system components.
For migrations, follow SAP standard migration practices. SAP recommends
following their best practices
for copying components from your source system to a newly created target system.
When the source and target systems use the same OS and database system, use
homogeneous system copy , and when the source and target systems use a
different OS or database system, use heterogeneous system copy .
Licensing
This section provides information about licensing requirements.
SAP Licensing
Running SAP on Google Cloud requires you to bring your own license (BYOL).
Note: After you deploy SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud, you must install
your permanent SAP NetWeaver license before the temporary license for SAP
NetWeaver expires.
See the following SAP Notes:
SAP note
2446441 -
Linux on Google Cloud Platform (IaaS): Adaption of your SAP License
2456953 - Windows on Google Cloud Platform (IaaS): Adaption of your SAP License
For more information from SAP about managing your SAP NetWeaver licenses, see
SAP Licensing Procedure .
Microsoft Windows Server and SQL Server
In Compute Engine, there are two ways to license Microsoft software:
With pay-as-you-go licensing, your Compute Engine VM hourly cost includes
licensing. Google manages the licensing logistics with Microsoft. Your
hourly costs are higher, but you have complete flexibility to increase and
decrease your costs, as needed. This is the licensing model used for Google Cloud
public images that include Windows Server, with or without SQL Server.
Important : Windows Server and SQL
Server are premium images. and all prices for premium images are in
addition to charges for using a machine type. Refer to Premium images for
details on pricing.
With BYOL, your Compute Engine VM costs are lower because the licensing
isn't included. You must migrate an existing license or purchase your own
license, which means paying up front, and you have less flexibility.
However, with very stable usage needs, or with no-charge or discounted
licensing through Microsoft licensing agreements, this approach might be
less expensive.
Microsoft's terms for migrating licenses are different for Windows Server and
SQL Server. For full details about BYOL on Google Cloud, see
Using Existing Microsoft Application Licenses .
For information about SAP license restrictions for SQL Server, see
SAP Note 2139358 .
Linux
In Compute Engine, there are two ways to license SLES or RHEL:
With pay-as-you-go licensing, your Compute Engine VM hourly cost includes
licensing. Google manages the licensing logistics. Your hourly costs are
higher, but you have complete flexibility to increase and decrease your
costs, as needed. This is the licensing model used for Google Cloud public images
that include SLES or RHEL.
Important : SLES and RHEL are
premium images, and all prices for premium images are in addition to
charges for using a machine type. Refer to Premium images for
details on pricing.
With BYOL, your Compute Engine VM costs are lower because the licensing
isn't included. You must migrate an existing license or purchase your own
license, which means paying up front, and you have less flexibility.
Support
For issues with Google Cloud infrastructure or services, contact Customer Care. You can find the contact information on the
Support Overview page
in the Google Cloud console. If Customer Care determines that a problem
resides in your SAP systems, then you are referred to SAP Support.
For SAP product-related issues, log your support request with
SAP support .
SAP evaluates the support ticket and, if it appears to be a Google Cloud
infrastructure issue, then SAP transfers that ticket to the appropriate
Google Cloud component in its system: BC-OP-LNX-GOOGLE or
BC-OP-NT-GOOGLE .
Support requirements
Before you can receive support for SAP systems and the
Google Cloud
infrastructure and services that they use, you must meet the minimum
support plan requirements.
