Automated VM deployment for IBM Db2 on Linux for SAP
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This deployment guide shows you how to deploy the Google Cloud
resources for an IBM Db2 instance on Linux that supports SAP applications.
The instructions in this guide use
Terraform
to deploy and configure the VM, the Linux operating system, the required disk
volumes for IBM Db2, and install Google Cloud's Agent for SAP.
For details on planning your deployment, see the
IBM Db2 for SAP planning guide .
Prerequisites
If you require your SAP workload to run in compliance with data residency, access control, support
personnel, or regulatory requirements, then you must create the required
Assured Workloads folder. For more information,
see Compliance and sovereign controls
for SAP on Google Cloud .
If you don't already have a Google Cloud project with billing enabled, then you
must create one before you can deploy a virtual machine (VM) for your IBM Db2
installation.
Creating a project
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector

Configuring the gcloud command environment
These instructions use
Cloud Shell to enter gcloud commands that deploy or configure
your Google Cloud resources. Cloud Shell is accessed through the
Google Cloud console in your browser.
Cloud Shell runs on a VM that Google Cloud provisions each time
you start Cloud Shell. The first time you use Cloud Shell,
Google Cloud also creates a persistent $HOME directory for you,
which is restored each time you open Cloud Shell.
The provisioned VM includes the latest
Google Cloud CLI .
Therefore, the gcloud
commands that you use in Cloud Shell are the same as
those you would use in a locally installed instance of the gcloud CLI.
If you have the gcloud CLI installed, you can issue the gcloud
commands that are used in these instructions from your local machine. However,
with a locally installed gcloud CLI you must always make sure that you
are using the latest version of the gcloud CLI.
Whether you use Cloud Shell or gcloud CLI, you
can set and change the properties of your gcloud command environment and save
them as a configuration . Configurations are collections of key-value pairs
that influence the behavior of the gcloud commands.
Some basic actions you can take with a configuration in Cloud Shell
include:
Initialize a configuration:
gcloud init
Check the settings of your current gcloud configuration:
gcloud config list
Switch to the required Google Cloud project. Replace
PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project ID.
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Set a default region. Replace REGION with a
Google Cloud region.
gcloud config set compute/region REGION
Set a default zone. Replace ZONE with a
Google Cloud zone.
gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
Create a new configuration. Replace NAME with the name
for the configuration.
gcloud config configurations create NAME
For more information about working with configurations, see
Managing gcloud CLI configurations .
Creating a network
For security purposes, create a new network. You can control who has access by
adding firewall rules or by using another access control method.
If your project has a default VPC network, then don't use it.
Instead, create your own VPC network so that the only firewall rules
in effect are those that you create explicitly.
During deployment, Compute Engine instances typically require access to the internet to
download Google Cloud's Agent for SAP. If you are using one of the SAP-certified Linux
images that are available from Google Cloud, then the compute instance also requires access
to the internet in order to register the license and to access OS vendor repositories.
A configuration with a NAT gateway and with VM network tags supports this access, even if the
target compute instances don't have external IPs.
To create a VPC network for your project, complete the following steps:
Create a custom mode network. For more information, see Creating a custom mode network .
Create a subnetwork, and specify the region and IP range. For more information, see Adding subnets .
Setting up a NAT gateway
If you need to create one or more VMs without public IP addresses, then you need to use network
address translation (NAT) to enable the VMs to access the internet. Use Cloud NAT, a
Google Cloud distributed, software-defined managed service that lets VMs send outbound
packets to the internet and receive any corresponding established inbound response packets.
Alternatively, you can set up a separate VM as a NAT gateway.
Key Point: When you configure Cloud NAT, specify at least
160 as the minimum number of ports per VM. Certain operating system updates run concurrent
processes that might exceed the Cloud NAT default for the number of ports, which can
result in activation or download errors.
When you create a Cloud NAT instance, specify the number of ports in the Minimum
ports per VM field under Advanced configurations on the Create a NAT gateway page in the
Google Cloud console.
To create a Cloud NAT instance for your project, see
Using Cloud NAT .
After you configure Cloud NAT for your project, your VM instances can
securely access the internet without a public IP address.
Adding firewall rules
By default, incoming connections from outside your Google Cloud network
are blocked. To allow incoming connections, set up a firewall rule for your VM.
Firewall rules regulate only new incoming connections to a VM. After a
connection is established with a VM, traffic is permitted in both directions
over that connection.
You can create a firewall rule to allow access to specified ports, or to allow
access between VMs on the same subnetwork.
Create firewall rules to allow access for such things as:
The default ports used by SAP NetWeaver, as documented in
TCP/IP Ports of All SAP Products .
Connections from your computer or your corporate network environment to your
Compute Engine VM instance. If you are unsure of what IP address to use,
talk to your company's network admin.
Communication between VMs in a 3-tier, scaleout, or high-availability
configuration. For example,
if you are deploying a 3-tier system, you will have at least 2 VMs in your
subnetwork: the VM for SAP NetWeaver, and another VM for the database server.
To enable communication between the two VMs, you must create a firewall rule
to allow traffic that originates from the subnetwork.
To create the firewall rules for your project, see
Creating firewall rules .
Deploying a Linux VM for Db2 with Terraform
The following instructions use Terraform to deploy a VM instance with Linux and
all of the persistent disks that IBM Db2 requires to support SAP applications.
You define the values for the installation in a sap_db2.tf
configuration file that Google Cloud provides.
The following instructions use Cloud Shell, but if you prefer, you can use
Terraform
in your local terminal instead.
Open the Cloud Shell.
Open Cloud Shell
Download the sap_db2.tf configuration file to your working
directory by entering the following command in the Cloud Shell:
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudsapdeploy/terraform/latest/terraform/sap_db2/terraform/sap_db2.tf
Open the sap_db2.tf file in the Cloud Shell code editor.
To open the Cloud Shell code editor, click Open Editor .
In the sap_db2.tf file, update the following argument values by replacing
the content inside the double quotation marks with the values for your
installation.
Most optional arguments have a default value. When you don't specify an
optional argument, the Terraform configuration uses that argument's default
value, if any.
Argument
Data type
Description
source
String
Specifies the location and version of the Terraform module to use
during deployment.
The sap_db2.tf configuration file
includes two instances of the source argument: one that is
active and one that is included as a comment. The source
argument that is active by default specifies latest as the
module version. The second instance of the source
argument, which by default is deactivated by a leading
# character, specifies a timestamp that identifies a
module version.
If you need all of your deployments to use the same module version,
then remove the leading # character from the
source argument that specifies the version timestamp and
add it to the source argument that specifies
latest .

sap_deployment_debug
Boolean
Optional. Only when Cloud Customer Care asks you to enable debugging for
your deployment, specify true , which makes the deployment
generate verbose deployment logs. The default value is false .
reservation_name
String
Optional. To use a specific
Compute Engine VM reservation
for this deployment, specify the name of the reservation.
By default, the installation script selects any available Compute Engine
reservation based on the following conditions.
For a reservation to be usable, regardless of whether you specify a name or the
installation script selects it automatically, the reservation must be set with
the following:
The specificReservationRequired option is set to
true or, in the Google Cloud console, the Select specific
reservation option is selected.
Some Compute Engine machine types support CPU platforms that are not
covered by the SAP certification of the machine type. If the target
reservation is for any of the following machine types, then the reservation
must specify the minimum CPU platforms as indicated:
n1-highmem-32 : Intel Broadwell
n1-highmem-64 : Intel Broadwell
n1-highmem-96 : Intel Skylake
m1-megamem-96 : Intel Skylake
The minimum CPU platforms for all of the other machine types that are
certified by SAP for use on Google Cloud conform to the SAP minimum CPU
requirement.
The following example sap_db2.tf configuration file creates a
VM that is configured to run both the IBM Db2 database server and SAP
NetWeaver. The configuration file directs Terarform to deploy an
n1-standard-16 VM that is running a SLES 15 SP3 operating system. The VM
includes all of the directories that are required to run IBM Db2 with SAP
NetWeaver.

}
To initialize your current working directory and download the Terraform
provider plugin and module files for Google Cloud:
terraform init
The terraform init command prepares your working directory for other
Terraform commands.
To force a refresh of the provider plugin and configuration files in your
working directory, specify the --upgrade flag. If the --upgrade flag
is omitted and you don't make any changes in your working directory, Terraform
uses the locally cached copies, even if latest is specified in the source URL.
terraform init --upgrade
Optionally, to create the Terraform execution plan:
terraform plan
The terraform plan command shows the changes required by your current
configuration. If you skip this step, the terraform apply
command automatically creates a new plan and prompts you to approve it.
To apply the execution plan:
terraform apply
When you are prompted to approve the actions, enter yes .
The terraform apply command sets up the Google Cloud infrastructure
according to the arguments defined in the Terraform configuration file.
The process can take a few minutes. To check the progress of your
deployment, follow the steps in the next section.
After the VM instance deploys, if you need Compute Engine to
save the boot disk in the event the VM instance is deleted, then follow these
steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Compute Engine
VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
To open the VM instance details page for your VM instance, click
the name of the VM instance.
Click Edit .
In the Boot disk section, for the Deletion rule ,
ensure that the Keep disk option is selected.
Click Save .
Verifying deployment
To verify deployment, you check the deployment logs in Cloud Logging and
check the configuration of the VM.
Check the logs
In the Google Cloud console, open Cloud Logging to monitor installation
progress and check for errors.
Note: You might incur costs when completing this step in Cloud Logging.
For more information, see
Cloud Logging pricing .
Go to Cloud Logging
Filter the logs:
Logs Explorer
In the Logs Explorer page, go to the Query pane.
From the Resource drop-down menu, select Global , and then click
Add .
If you don't see the Global option, then in the query editor, enter
the following query:
resource . type = "global"
"Deployment"
Click Run query .
Legacy Logs Viewer
In the Legacy Logs Viewer page, from the basic selector menu, select
Global as your logging resource.
Analyze the filtered logs:
If "--- Finished" is displayed, then the
deployment processing is complete and you can
proceed to the next step.
If you see a quota error:
On the IAM & Admin
Quotas
page, increase any of your quotas that do not meet the
IBM Db2 requirements that are listed in the
Open Cloud Shell.
Go to Cloud Shell
Go to your working directory and delete the deployment to clean
up the VMs and persistent disks from the failed installation:
terraform destroy
When you are prompted to approve the action, enter yes .
Rerun your deployment.
Check the configuration of the VM
After the VM instance deploys without errors, connect to your VM using SSH.
From the Compute Engine
VM instances page,
you can click the SSH button for your VM, or you can use your preferred
SSH method.
