Entities, Properties, and Keys
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Data objects in Firestore in Datastore mode are known as entities . An entity has one or more named properties , each of which can have one or more values. Entities of the same kind don't need to have the same properties, and an entity's values for a given property don't all need to be of the same data type. (If necessary, an application can establish and enforce such restrictions in its own data model.)
Datastore mode supports a variety of data types for property values .
These include, among others:
Integers
Floating-point numbers
Strings
Dates
Binary data
Each entity in a Datastore mode database has a key that uniquely
identifies it. The key consists of the following components:
The namespace of the entity, which allows for multitenancy
The kind of the entity, which categorizes it for the purpose of queries
An identifier for the individual entity, which can be either
a key name string
an integer numeric ID
An optional ancestor path locating the entity within the database hierarchy
An application can fetch an individual entity
from the database using the entity's key, or it can retrieve one or more entities
by issuing a query based on the entities' keys or property values.
Firestore in Datastore mode itself does not enforce any restrictions on the structure of entities, such as whether a given property has a value of a particular type; this task is left to the application.
The snippets on this page build upon the example at Getting started with Firestore in Datastore mode .
Work with entities
Applications can use the Firestore in Datastore mode API to create, retrieve, update, and delete entities. If the application knows the complete key for an entity (or can derive it from its parent key, kind, and identifier), it can use the key to operate directly on the entity. An application can also obtain an entity's key as a result of a query; see the Queries topic for more information.
Note: If you want to learn about creating, modifying, or deleting entities in
the Google Cloud console, see the Quickstart .
Create an entity
You create a new entity by initializing it and setting its properties:

You can save the entity to the database by using upsert (which will overwrite an
entity if it already exists in Datastore mode) or insert (which requires that the entity key not already exist).
Here's how you upsert an entity:

The provided data overwrites the existing entity.
The entire object must be sent to the database.
If the entity does not exist, the update will fail.
If you want to update-or-create an entity, use upsert as described previously.
Using a transaction
lets you perform the get and update operations in a single atomic
transaction.
Note: To delete a property, remove the property from the entity, then save the entity.
Delete an entity
Given an entity's key, you can delete the entity:

Batch operations
Firestore in Datastore mode supports batch versions of the operations which allow it to operate on multiple objects in a single Datastore mode call.
Such batch calls are faster than making separate calls for each individual entity because they incur the overhead for only one service call. If multiple entity groups are involved, the work for all the groups is performed in parallel on the server side.
For example, you can upsert multiple entities:

Batch operations don't change your read, write, or delete costs, which are
documented at Pricing and Quota . You will be
charged for every key in a batched operation, whether or not each key exists.
The size of the entities involved in an operation does not affect the read,
write, or delete costs. However, the size of entities does
impact your storage size costs .
Note: The multiple updates specified in a non-transactional commit() are not performed transactionally. So if the commit ends with an error, it is possible that some, none, or all of the requested operations have been performed. If you need transactional batch updates, use the transactional API .
Increment and other property transforms
Use property transforms like increment to make server-side updates to a
property. A property transform avoids an additional client-side read operation
to get the current value and avoids a client-side calculation to determine
the new value.
Datastore mode supports the following property
transforms:
increment
maximum
minimum
appendMissingElements
removeAllFromArray
setToServerValue(REQUEST_TIME)
Note: Each of these operation is billed for one read operation
and one write operation.
The following example demonstrate a property transform. This
operation increments properties by the specified
values:
REST
POST https://datastore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{projectId}:commit
{
"mode": "NON_TRANSACTIONAL",
"mutations": [
{
"propertyMask": {}, // Empty write mask indicates only transforms can change the entity.
"propertyTransforms": [
{
"property": "quantity",
"increment": {
"integerValue": 2
}
},
{
"property": "inStock",
"maximum": {
"integerValue": 100
}
},
]
"upsert": {
"key": {
"path": [
{
"kind": "Items",
"name": "entity_1"
}
]
}
}
}
]
}
The following example sets a property value to the time at which the server
processed the request with millisecond precision.
REST
POST https://datastore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{projectId}:commit
{
"mode": "NON_TRANSACTIONAL",
"mutations": [
{
"propertyMask": {}, // // Empty write mask indicates only transforms can change the entity.
"propertyTransforms": [
{
"property": "timeField",
"setToServerValue": "REQUEST_TIME"
},
]
"upsert": {
"key": {
"path": [
{
"kind": "Kind_1",
"name": "entity_1"
}
]
}
}
}
]
}
The following example appends array elements if they are missing.
REST
POST https://datastore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{projectId}:commit
{
"mode": "NON_TRANSACTIONAL",
"mutations": [
{
"propertyMask": {}, // Empty write mask indicates only transforms can change the entity.
"propertyTransforms": [
{
"property": "arrayField",
"appendMissingElements": {
"values": [
{ "stringValue": "str" }, { "integerValue": 10 }
]
}
},
]
"upsert": {
"key": {
"path": [
{
"kind": "Kind_1",
"name": "entity_1"
}
]
}
}
}
]
}
Mixed types with maximum and minimum
The maximum and minimum property transforms take either an integer or
a double (floating-point number) value as input. The value in the
target property can also be an integer or a double value.
If the property is not an integer or double, or if the property doesn't
exist, the transformation sets the property to the given input value and type. If a maximum
operation is applied where the property and the input value are of mixed types
(that is, one is an integer and one is a double) the property takes on the type
of the larger operand. For minimum , the property takes on the type of the
smaller operand.
If the operands are equivalent (e.g. 3 and 3.0), the
property does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero. The maximum or minimum of a zero
stored value and zero input value is always the stored value. The maximum or minimum of any
numeric value and NaN is NaN.
Multiple mutations and PropertyMask
Property transforms are sequentially applied after any additional
mutations in the request. A PropertyMask
restricts insert , update , and upsert mutations to the specified
properties, but does not restrict
property transforms.
For example, starting with the following entity:
REST
entity: {
"key" : {
"path": [
{
"kind": "Kind_1",
"name": "entity_1"
}
]
}
"properties" : {
"a": 1,
"b": 2,
"c": 3
}
}
The following request updates both a and b and then applies a property
transform to property b :
POST https://datastore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ { projectId }: commit
{
"mode" : "NON_TRANSACTIONAL" ,
"mutations" : [
{
"propertyMask" : { "a" , "b" }, // update property a , b
"update" : {
"key" : {
"path" : [
{
"kind" : "Kind_1" ,
"name" : "entity_1"
}
]
}
"properties" : {
"a" : "new_value" ,
"b" : -2
}
},
"propertyTransforms" : [
{
"property" : "b" ,
"increment" : {
"integerValue" : 2
}
}
]
}
]
}
The result is the following:
REST
entity: {
"key" : {
"path": [
{
"kind": "Kind_1",
"name": "entity_1"
}
]
}
"properties" : {
"a": "new_value",
"b": 0,
"c": 3
}
}
Kinds and identifiers
Each entity is of a particular kind , which categorizes the entity for the purpose of queries. For example, a task list application might represent each task to complete with an entity of kind Task .
All kind names that begin with two underscores ( __ ) are reserved and may not be used.
Assign identifiers
In addition to a kind, each entity has an identifier , assigned when the entity is created. Because it is part of the entity's key, the identifier is associated permanently with the entity and cannot be changed. It can be assigned in either of two ways:
Your application can specify its own key name string for the entity.
For information about the maximum size of the entity key string, see Limits .
You can have Firestore in Datastore mode automatically assign the entity an integer numeric ID .
For best practices on assigning identifiers, see the Keys section in the best practices .
The following example creates a key with kind Task that uses a key name, "sampleTask", as the identifier:

Datastore mode can also automatically assign IDs. Datastore mode generates a random sequence of unused IDs that are approximately uniformly distributed. Each ID can be up to 16 decimal digits long.
The following example creates a key with kind Task , without using a key name. The full key (including the automatically assigned ID) of the entity will be returned when
an entity with the incomplete key is saved to Datastore mode:

If you want to display the entity IDs to the user, and/or depend upon their order, the best thing to do is use manual allocation.
Assign your own numeric ID
Instead of using key name strings or generating numeric IDs automatically,
advanced applications may sometimes assign their own numeric IDs
manually to the entities they create. Be aware, however, that there is nothing
to prevent a Datastore mode database from assigning one of your manual
numeric IDs to another entity. The only way to avoid such conflicts is to have
your application obtain a block of IDs with the allocateIds() method.
Datastore mode's automatic ID generator will keep track of IDs that have
been allocated with these methods and will avoid reusing them for another
entity, so you can safely use such IDs without conflict. You can't manually
choose which values are returned by the allocateIds() method. The values
returned by allocateIds() are assigned by Datastore mode.
Important: Don't use the value 0 (zero) for the ID. If you do, you will get an
automatically allocated ID.
Ancestor paths
Entities in a Datastore mode database form a hierarchically structured
space similar to the directory structure of a file system. When you create an
entity, you can optionally designate another entity as its parent ; the new
entity is a child of the parent entity (note that unlike in a file system, the
parent entity need not actually exist). An entity without a parent is a root
entity . The association between an entity and its parent is permanent, and
cannot be changed once the entity is created. Datastore mode will never
assign the same numeric ID to two entities with the same parent, or to two root
entities (those without a parent).
An entity can have multiple levels of ancestors and descendants. An entity's
parent, parent's parent, and so on recursively, are its ancestors ; its
children, children's children, and so on, are its descendants . The sequence of
entities beginning with a root entity and proceeding from parent to child,
leading to a given entity, constitute that entity's ancestor path . The
complete key identifying the entity consists of a sequence of kind-identifier
pairs specifying its ancestor path and terminating with those of the entity
itself:
[User:alice, TaskList:default, Task:sampleTask]
For a root entity, the ancestor path is empty and the key consists solely of
the entity's own kind and identifier:
[User:alice]
Levels of parents
Use levels of parents to organize your data. For example, if your application
organizes Task entities by TaskList entities, use one level of parent:

As shown in the earlier example, when you create an entity with a parent, you
specify the parent's complete ancestor path.
An application that maintains user profiles may require only one level of parent
for the user profile data. For example, use a single level User ancestor path
for Profile entities:
[User:alice, Profile:public]
An application that provides conference room scheduling may require multiple
levels of parents, such as a multiple level Building/Floor ancestor path for
Room entities:
[Building:C, Floor:1, Room:123]
Entity groups
An entity group consists of a root entity and all of its descendants.
Applications typically use entity groups to organize highly related data. For
example, an application could use an entity group to store data about one
product, or one user profile.
Properties and value types
The data values associated with an entity consist of one or more properties . Each property has a name and one or more values.
A property can have values of more than one type, and two entities can have values of different types for the same property. A property can be indexed or unindexed (queries that order or filter on a property p will ignore entities where p is unindexed).
Some example properties:

Array properties can be useful, for example, when performing queries with equality filters: an entity satisfies the query if any of its values for a property matches the value specified in the filter. For more details on array properties, including issues you should be aware of, see the Queries topic.
Supported value types
Properties are stored as a string/value map that contains the entity's property names and values. The following types are supported for values:
Array
REST API
field name: arrayValue
type: an ArrayValue object that contains an array of JSON Value objects
An array property can be assigned by using the arrayValue field, which
is of type
ArrayValue ,
and setting its values field to an array of values. For a property to be
unindexed, set the excludeFromIndexes field of the property's value object
to true .
RPC API
field name: array_value
type: an ArrayValue message that contains one or more Value messages
An array property can be assigned by using the array_value field, which is of type ArrayValue ,
and populating its values field with multiple Value objects. For a property
to be unindexed, set the exclude_from_indexes field of Value to true .
Sort order: None
Notes: Cannot contain another array value. The value instance must not set meaning or exclude_from_indexes .
Boolean
REST API
field name: booleanValue
type: true or false
RPC API
field name: boolean_value
type: bool
Sort order: false < true
Blob
REST API
field name: blobValue
type: string. Must be base64-encoded.
RPC API
field name: blob_value
type: bytes
Sort order: Byte order
Notes: Up to 1,500 bytes if property is indexed, up to 1,048,487 bytes (1 MiB - 89 bytes) otherwise.
Date and time
REST API
field name: timestampValue
type: string (RFC 3339 formatted, with milliseconds, for instance 2013-05-14T00:01:00.234Z )
RPC API
field name: timestamp_value
type: Timestamp
Sort order: Chronological
Notes:
When stored in Datastore mode, precise only to microseconds; any additional precision is rounded down.
When returned as part of a projection query ,
Datastore mode converts timestamp values to microsecond integer
values.
Embedded entity
REST API
field name: entityValue
type: a JSON entity
RPC API
field name: entity_value
type: an Entity message
Sort order: None
Notes: When indexed, you can query on subproperties. If you exclude this value from indexing, then all subproperties are also excluded from indexing.
Floating-point number
REST API
field name: doubleValue
type: number
RPC API
field name: double_value
type: double
Sort order: Numeric
Notes: 64-bit double precision, IEEE 754
Geographical point
REST API
field name: geoPointValue
type: a JSON latitude/longitude pair
RPC API
field name: geo_point_value
type: a LatLng message
Sort order: By latitude, then longitude
Integer
REST API
field name: integerValue
type: number or string. Use strings for integers that cannot be exactly represented as numbers.
RPC API
field name: integer_value
type: int64
Sort order: Numeric
Key
REST API
field name: keyValue
type: a JSON Datastore mode key
RPC API
field name: key_value
type: a Key message
Sort order: By path elements (kind, identifier, kind, identifier...)
Null
REST API
field name: nullValue
type: null
RPC API
field name: null_value
type: NullValue
Sort order: None
Text string
REST API
field name: stringValue
type: string
RPC API
field name: string_value
type: string
Sort order: UTF-8 encoded byte order
Notes: Up to 1,500 bytes if property is indexed, up to 1,048,487 bytes (1 MiB - 89 bytes) otherwise.
Value type ordering
When a query involves a property with values of mixed types, a Datastore mode
database uses a deterministic ordering based on the internal representations.
The following list shows the order:
Null values
Fixed-point numbers
Integers
Dates and times
Boolean values
Byte strings
Unicode strings
Floating-point numbers
NaN values
Geographical points
Datastore mode keys
Note: Integers and floating-point numbers are considered separate types in Datastore mode. If an entity uses a mix of integers and floats for the same property, all integers will be sorted before all floats, for example: 7 < 3.2 .
