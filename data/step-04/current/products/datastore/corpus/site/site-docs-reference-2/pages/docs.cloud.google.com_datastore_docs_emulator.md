Test Datastore Mode using the Firestore emulator
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Google Cloud CLI provides a local, in-memory emulator for
Firestore that you can use to test your Firestore in Datastore mode application.
You can use the emulator with all Datastore mode client libraries.
You should use the emulator only for local testing.
Use the gcloud emulators firestore with --database-mode=datastore-mode
to test Firestore in Datastore mode behavior.
Don't use the emulator for production deployments. Because the emulator stores
data only in memory, it doesn't persist data across runs.
Install the emulator
Note: The Firestore emulator will be updated to require Java 21
in the upcoming Google Cloud CLI release 528.0.0. Upgrade to Java 21 or later
to continue using the latest version of the emulator.
To install the Firestore emulator, install and update the
gcloud CLI:
Install the gcloud CLI .
Update your gcloud CLI installation to get the latest
features:
gcloud components update
Run the emulator
Run the following command to start the emulator:
gcloud emulators firestore start --database-mode=datastore-mode
The emulator prints the host and port number where it is running.
By default, the emulator attempts to use 127.0.0.1:8080 . To bind the
emulator to a specific host and port, use the optional --host-port flag,
replacing HOST and PORT :
gcloud emulators firestore start --database-mode=datastore-mode --host-port= HOST : PORT
Use the keyboard shortcut Control + C to stop the emulator.
Note: The default port for the emulator is 8080 . This differs from the
legacy Cloud Datastore emulator which used default port 8081 .
Connect to the emulator
To connect a client library and app to the emulator,
set the DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST environment variable. When this environment
variable is set, the client libraries automatically connect to the emulator.
export DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST = " HOST : PORT "
Import entities into the emulator
The emulator's import feature lets you load entities from a set of entity export
files into the emulator. The entity export files can come from an export of
your Datastore mode database or from an emulator instance.
You can import entities into the emulator in two ways. The first is to add the
flag import-data to your emulator start command. The second method is to
send a POST import request to the emulator. You can use
curl or a similar tool. Refer to the following
examples.
Protocol
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/emulator/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID :import \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"database":" DATABASE ", "export_directory":" EXPORT_DIRECTORY "}'
Modify localhost:8080 if the emulator uses a different port.
CLI Flag
gcloud emulators firestore start --database-mode=datastore-mode --import-data= EXPORT_DIRECTORY
where:
[PROJECT_ID] is the ID of your project.
[DATABASE] is the database path. For example a project with default database would look like the following:
{"database":"projects/myProject/databases/"}
[EXPORT_DIRECTORY] is the path to the overall_export_metadata file of your
entity export files. For example:
{"export_directory":"/home/user/myexports/2024-03-26T19:39:33_443/2024-03-26T19:39:33_443.overall_export_metadata"}
Note: Exporting entities of specific kinds or namespaces is not supported.
Export entities in the emulator
The emulator's export feature lets you save entities in the emulator into a
set of entity export files. You can then use an import operation to load the
entities in the entity export files into your Datastore mode database or
into an emulator instance.
You can export entities from the emulator in two ways. The first is to add the
flag export-on-exit to your emulator start command. The second method is to
send a POST export request to the emulator. You can use
curl or a similar tool. Refer to the following
examples.
Protocol
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/emulator/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID :export \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"database":" DATABASE_PATH ", "export_directory":" EXPORT_DIRECTORY "}'
Modify localhost:8080 if the emulator uses a different port.
CLI Flag
gcloud emulators firestore start --database-mode=datastore-mode --export-on-exit= EXPORT_DIRECTORY
where:
[PROJECT_ID] is the ID of your project.
[DATABASE_PATH] is the database path. For example a project with default database would look like the following:
{"database":"projects/myProject/databases/"}
[EXPORT_DIRECTORY] specifies the directory where the emulator saves the
entity export files. This directory must not already contain a set of
entity export files. For example:
{"export_directory":"/home/user/myexports/2024-03-26/"}
Note: Exporting entities of specific kinds or namespaces is not supported.
Persist data in the emulator
By default, the Firestore emulator does not persist data to disk.
To persist emulator data, run the following command to use import and export
flags to load and save the data across emulator instances:
gcloud emulators firestore start -- database - mode = datastore - mode -- import - data = EXPORT_DIRECTORY -- export - on - exit = EXPORT_DIRECTORY
Reset emulator data
The Firestore emulator includes a REST endpoint for resetting all
the data in the emulator. You can use this endpoint to clear data
between tests without shutting down the emulator.
To reset all the data in the emulator, perform an HTTP POST operation against
the following endpoint, replacing HOST and PORT with the
host and port you selected and replacing PROJECT_ID with your
own project ID:
http:// HOST : PORT /reset
Adjust the host and port if the emulator does not use 127.0.0.1:8080 .
Your code should await REST confirmation that the reset finished or failed.
You can perform this operation from the shell using curl :
$ curl -X POST "http:// HOST : PORT /reset"
How the emulator differs from production
The emulator attempts to faithfully replicate the
behavior of the production service with some notable limitations.
Concurrency and consistency
The emulator supports only pessimistic concurrency and strong consistency.
The emulator does not support optimistic concurrency and eventual consistency
settings.
Transactions
The emulator doesn't attempt to mimic the transaction behavior that's seen in
production. It uses a simple locking approach and doesn't attempt to mirror
the various concurrency modes offered in the production environment.
When you're testing features that involve multiple concurrent writes to one
document, the emulator might be slow to complete write requests. It might take
up to 30 seconds for the emulator to release the locks. If you need to adjust
the test timeout intervals, then do so.
The emulator doesn't also attempt to mimic all of the
production limits , such as
timeouts & size limits, which involve transactions. If you test features that
depend on these production limits, then we recommend that you use a production
environment instead of an emulator.
Indexes
The emulator does not track composite indexes and instead executes any
valid query. Make sure to test your app against a real Datastore mode
instance to determine which indexes you require.
Limits
The emulator does not enforce all limits enforced in production. For example,
the emulator may allow transactions that would be rejected as too large by the
production service. Make sure that you are familiar with the
documented limits and that you design your app to
proactively avoid them.
