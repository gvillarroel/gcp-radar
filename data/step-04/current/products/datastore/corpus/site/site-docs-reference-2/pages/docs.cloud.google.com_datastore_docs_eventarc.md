Overview of event-driven architectures with Eventarc
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can use Eventarc and
Firestore in Datastore mode to build
event-driven architectures.
Firestore in Datastore mode provides triggers for
Eventarc that generate events from changes
to a particular entity in your database. The trigger can route events to a
supported destination :
Cloud Run functions (2nd gen)

Google Kubernetes Engine
Workflows
Eventarc offers a standardized solution to manage the flow of
state changes, called events , between decoupled microservices. When triggered,
Eventarc routes these events to
various destinations while managing delivery, security, authorization,
observability, and error-handling for you.
Note: Eventarc events use the CloudEvents specification.
Example use cases
An event-driven architecture is a system design pattern where services react
to changes in state known as events. You can use this pattern alongside the
scalability of Firestore to add more features to your app.
For example, you might add the following capabilities:
Interoperability between different technology stacks
Replicate your data and transform it before sending it to an
analytics system.
Parallel processing
Fan out operations for parallel processing. If you have multiple systems that
operate based on entity changes, you can use the push-based streams in each
consumer and route the event to multiple consumers.
Push-based event streams
Build push-based messaging designs. Clients can receive notifications without needing to poll remote services. Without the polling latency,
you can better perform on-the-fly data processing and real-time analysis.
State monitoring and alerting
Use an event-driven architecture to add custom
metrics to your database operations. Monitor and receive alerts on changes and updates. Detect anomalies.
Limitations
Note the following limitations for Datastore mode triggers for
Eventarc:
Ordering is not guaranteed. Rapid changes can trigger events in an unexpected order.
Events are delivered at least once.
Make sure your event handler is idempotent and avoid producing unexpected results
or side effects when an event is delivered more than once. Refer to
Building idempotent functions to learn more.
A trigger is associated with a single database. You cannot create a trigger that matches multiple databases.
Deleting a database does not automatically delete any triggers for that database. The
trigger stops delivering events but continues to exist until you delete the trigger .
Eventarc and Firestore in Datastore mode locations
Eventarc does not support multi-regions for Firestore event
triggers, but you can still create triggers for Firestore databases
in multi-region locations. Eventarc maps Firestore
multi-region locations to the following Eventarc regions:
Firestore multi-region
Eventarc region
nam5
us-central1
eur3
europe-west4
Datastore mode and Native mode event interoperability
Eventarc supports event triggers for both Datastore mode and Native
mode. These event triggers are interoperable with both database types.
A Firestore in Native mode database can receive Datastore
events, and a Firestore in Datastore mode database can receive
Native mode events.
Event interoperability lets you share Eventarc code across
Firestore databases of different types.
Event conversions
If you apply a Native mode event trigger to a Datastore
mode database, Eventarc makes the following conversions:
The namespace of the entity is stored in the event's PartitionId attribute.
Embedded entities are converted to Native mode map types.
