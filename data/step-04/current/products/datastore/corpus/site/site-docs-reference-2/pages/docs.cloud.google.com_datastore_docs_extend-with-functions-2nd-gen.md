Extend Datastore with Cloud Functions (2nd gen)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
With Cloud Run functions and Eventarc, you can deploy code to
handle events triggered by changes in your Firestore in Datastore mode database. This
allows you to add server-side functionality without running your own servers.
Datastore mode triggers
Eventarc supports the following Firestore in Datastore mode event
triggers to let you create Cloud Run functions (2nd gen) handlers tied to
Firestore in Datastore mode events:
Event Type
Trigger
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.created
Triggered when an entity is written for the first time.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.updated
Triggered when an entity already exists and has any value changed.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.deleted
Triggered when an entity is deleted.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.written
Triggered when created , updated or deleted is triggered.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.created.withAuthContext
Same as created but adds authentication information.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.updated.withAuthContext
Same as updated but adds authentication information.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.deleted.withAuthContext
Same as deleted but adds authentication information.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.written.withAuthContext
Same as written but adds authentication information.
Datastore mode event triggers respond only
to entity changes. An update to a Datastore mode entity where data
is unchanged (a no-op write) does not generate an update or write event. You
cannot generate events for only specific properties.
Include authentication context in the event
To include additional authentication information about the event, use an event
trigger with the withAuthContext extension. This extension adds additional
information about the principal that triggered the event. It adds the
authtype and authid attributes in addition to the information returned in
the base event. See the
authcontext reference for more information about attribute values.
Write an entity-triggered function
To write a function that responds to Firestore in Datastore mode events,
prepare to specify the following during deployment:
a trigger event type
a trigger event filter to select the entities associated with the function
the function code to run
Trigger event filters
When you specify an event filter, you can specify either an exact entity
match or a path pattern. Use a path pattern to match multiple entities with
the wildcards * or ** .
For example, you can specify an exact entity match to respond to changes to the
following entity:
users/marie
Use wildcards, * or ** , to respond to changes in entities
that match a pattern. The * wildcard matches a single segment, and
the ** multi-segment wildcard matches zero or more segments in the pattern.
For single segment matches ( * ) you can also use a named capture group, such
as users/{userId} .
The following table demonstrates valid path patterns:
Pattern
Description
users/* or users/{userId}
Matches all entities of kind users . Does not match descendant entities level like /users/marie/messages/33e2IxYBD9enzS50SJ68
users/**
Matches all entities of kind users and all descendant entities like
/users/marie/messages/33e2IxYBD9enzS50SJ68
To learn more about path patterns, see Eventarc path patterns .
Your trigger must always point to an entity, even if you're using a wildcard.
See the following examples:
users/{userId=*}/{messages=*} is not valid because {messages=*}
is a kind ID.
users/{userId=*}/{messages}/{messageId=*} is
valid because {messageId=*} always points to an entity.
Character escaping
The section describes situations that require you to escape characters in
kind IDs and entity IDs. Escaping a character lets the event filter correctly
interpret the ID.
If a kind ID or entity ID includes a ~ or / character, you must
escape the ID in your event filter. To escape an ID, use the format
__esc ENCODED_ID __ .
Replace ENCODED_ID with a kind ID or entity ID that has all ~ and
/ characters replaced by their encoding IDs, which are the following:
~ : ~0
/ : ~1
For example, the kind ID user/profile becomes __escusers~1profile__ . An
example path pattern with this kind ID is __escusers~1profile__/{userId}
If you use the kind ID or entity ID of either . or .. in your event filter,
you must escape the ID as follows:
. : __esc~2__
.. : __esc~2~2__
You need to escape the . character only if the ID is exactly . or .. .
For example, the kind ID customers.info does not require escaping.
If your kind or entity ID is a numeric value instead of a string value,
you must escape the ID with __id NUMERIC_VALUE __ .
For example, the path pattern for an entity of kind 111 and entity ID 222
is __id111__/__id222__ .
If you migrated from Legacy Cloud Datastore
to Firestore in Datastore mode, your database might contain legacy IDs in a non-UTF8 encoding.
You must escape these IDs with __bytes BASE64_ENCODING __ .
Replace BASE64_ENCODING with the base-64 encoding of the ID. For
example, the path pattern Task/{task} with escaping for non-UTF8 kind ID
Task becomes __bytesVGFzaw==__/{task} .
Example functions
The following sample demonstrates how to receive Datastore mode events.
To work with the data involved in an event, look at the value and
old_value fields.
value : An EntityResult object that contains a post-operation entity snapshot.
This field is not populated for delete events.
old_value : An EntityResult object that contains a pre-operation entity
snapshot. This field is only populated for update and delete events.
Java
To learn how to install and use the client library for Datastore mode, see
Datastore mode client libraries .
For more information, see the
Datastore mode Java API
reference documentation .
To authenticate to Datastore mode, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see
Set up authentication for a local development environment .
import com.google.cloud.functions.CloudEventsFunction ;
import com.google.events.cloud.datastore.v1. EntityEventData ;
import com.google.protobuf. InvalidProtocolBufferException ;
import io.cloudevents.CloudEvent ;
import java.util.logging.Logger ;
public class Datastore implements CloudEventsFunction {
private static final Logger logger = Logger . getLogger ( Datastore . class . getName ());
@Override
public void accept ( CloudEvent event ) throws InvalidProtocolBufferException {
EntityEventData datastoreEventData = EntityEventData . parseFrom ( event . getData (). toBytes ());
logger . info ( "Function triggered by event on: " + event . getSource ());
logger . info ( "Event type: " + event . getType ());
logger . info ( "Old value:" );
logger . info ( datastoreEventData . getOldValue (). toString ());
logger . info ( "New value:" );
logger . info ( datastoreEventData . getValue (). toString ());
}
}
Include the proto dependencies in your source
You must include the Datastore mode data.proto
file in the source directory for your function. This file imports the following
protos which you must also include in your source directory:
google/protobuf/struct.proto
google/protobuf/timestamp.proto
google/type/latlng.proto
Use the same directory structure for the dependencies. For example, place
struct.proto within google/protobuf .
These files are required to decode event data. If your function source does
not include these files, it returns an error when it runs.
Event attributes
Each event includes data attributes
that include information about the event such as the time the event triggered.
Firestore in Datastore mode adds additional data about the database and entity
involved in the event. You can access these attributes as follows:
Java
logger . info ( "Event time " + event . getTime ());
logger . info ( "Event project: " + event . getExtension ( "project" ));
logger . info ( "Event location: " + event . getExtension ( "location" ));
logger . info ( "Database name: " + event . getExtension ( "database" ));
logger . info ( "Database namespace: " + event . getExtension ( "namespace" ));
logger . info ( "Database entity: " + event . getExtension ( "entity" ));
// For withAuthContext events
logger . info ( "Auth information: " + event . getExtension ( "authid" ));
logger . info ( "Auth information: " + event . getExtension ( "authtype" ));
Deploy a function
Users deploying Cloud Run functions must have the
Cloud Run functions Developer
IAM role or a role that includes the same permissions. See also
Additional configuration for deployment .
You can deploy a function using either the gcloud CLI
or the Google Cloud console. The example below demonstrates deployment with
the gcloud CLI. For details on deployment with the Google Cloud console,
see Deploy Cloud Run functions .
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Use the gcloud functions deploy
command to deploy a function:
gcloud functions deploy FUNCTION_NAME \
--gen2 \
--region= FUNCTION_LOCATION \
--trigger-location= TRIGGER_LOCATION \
--runtime= RUNTIME \
--source= SOURCE_LOCATION \
--entry-point= CODE_ENTRYPOINT \
--trigger-event-filters="type= EVENT_FILTER_TYPE " \
--trigger-event-filters="database= DATABASE " \
--trigger-event-filters="namespace= NAMESPACE " \
--trigger-event-filters-path-pattern="entity= ENTITY_OR_PATH "
The first argument, FUNCTION_NAME , is a name for
your deployed function. The function name must start with a letter
followed by up to 62 letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores, and must end
with a letter or a number. Replace FUNCTION_NAME with a valid
function name. Then, add the following flags:
The --gen2 flag
specifies that you want to deploy to Cloud Run functions (2nd gen). Omitting
this flag results in deployment to Cloud Run functions (1st gen).
The --region= FUNCTION_LOCATION flag
specifies the region in which to deploy your function.
To maximize proximity, set FUNCTION_LOCATION to a region near
your Firestore database. If your Firestore database is
in a multi-region location, set the value to us-central1 for databases
in nam5 and to europe-west4 for databases in eur3 . For regional
Firestore locations, set to the same region.
The --trigger-location= TRIGGER_LOCATION
flag specifies the location of the trigger.
You must set TRIGGER_LOCATION to the location of your Datastore mode database.
The --runtime= RUNTIME flag
specifies which language runtime your function uses. Cloud Run functions
supports several runtimes. See
Runtimes for more information.
Set RUNTIME to a supported runtime.
The --source= SOURCE_LOCATION flag
specifies the location of your function source code. See the following
for details:
Deploy from your local machine
Deploy from Cloud Storage
Deploy from a source repository
Set SOURCE_LOCATION to the location of your function source code.
The --entry-point= CODE_ENTRYPOINT
flag specifies the entry point to your function in your source code. This is
the code that your function executes when it runs. You must set
CODE_ENTRYPOINT to a function name or fully-qualified class
name that exists in your source code. See
Function entry point for
more information.
The --trigger-event-filters
flags define the event filter which includes trigger type and the entity
or path that triggers the events.
Set the following attribute values to define your event filter:
type= EVENT_FILTER_TYPE : Firestore
supports the following event types:
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.created : event is sent when an
entity is written for the first time.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.updated : event is sent when an
entity already exists and has any value changed.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.deleted : event is sent when an
entity is deleted.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.written : event is sent when an
entity is created, updated, or deleted.
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.created.withAuthContext : event is sent
when a document is written to for the first time and the event includes
additional authentication information
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.updated.withAuthContext : event is sent
when a document already exists and has any value changed. Includes
additional authentication information
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.deleted.withAuthContext : event is sent
when a document is deleted. Includes additional authentication information
google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.written.withAuthContext : event is sent
when a document is created, updated, or deleted and event. Includes
additional authentication information
Set EVENT_FILTER_TYPE to one of these event types.
database= DATABASE : the Firestore database.
For the default database name, set DATABASE to (default) .
namespace= NAMESPACE : the database
namespace . For the default
database name, set NAMESPACE to (default) . Remove the flag
to match any namespace.
Note: Set exactly to (default) for the default namespace. This is
a non-canonical resource name used only for Eventarc. Do not
set to [default] as shown in the Google Cloud console.
entity= ENTITY_OR_PATH : the database path that
triggers events when data is created, updated, or
deleted. Accepted values for ENTITY_OR_PATH are:
Equal; for example, --trigger-event-filters="entity='users/marie'"
Path pattern; for example, --trigger-event-filters-path-pattern="entity='users/*'" .
For more information, see Understand path patterns .
You can optionally specify additional
configuration ,
networking , and
security options when you deploy a function.
For a complete reference on the deployment command and its flags, see the
gcloud functions deploy
documentation.
Example deployments
The following examples demonstrate deployments with the Google Cloud CLI.
Deploy a function for a database in the us-west2 region:
gcloud functions deploy gcfv2-trigger-datastore-node \
--gen2 \
--region = us-west2 \
--trigger-location = us-west2 \
--runtime = nodejs18 \
--source = gs://example_bucket-1/datastoreEventFunction.zip \
--entry-point = makeUpperCase \
--trigger-event-filters = type = google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.written \
--trigger-event-filters = database = '(default)' \
--trigger-event-filters-path-pattern = "entity='messages/{pushId}'"
Deploy a function for a database in the nam5 multi-region:
gcloud functions deploy gcfv2-trigger-datastore-python \
--gen2 \
--region = us-central1 \
--trigger-location = nam5 \
--runtime = python311 \
--source = gs://example_bucket-1/datastoreEventFunction.zip \
--entry-point = make_upper_case \
--trigger-event-filters = type = google.cloud.datastore.entity.v1.written.withAuthContext \
--trigger-event-filters = database = '(default)' \
--trigger-event-filters-path-pattern = "entity='messages/{pushId}'"
Limitations
Note the following limitations for Firestore triggers for Cloud Run functions:
Cloud Run functions (1st gen) prerequisites an existing "(default)" database in Firestore native mode. It does not
support Firestore named databases or Datastore mode. Please use Cloud Run functions
(2nd gen) to configure events in such cases.
Cross project setup with Cloud Run functions and Firestore trigger is a limitation. To setup Firestore trigger Cloud Run functions must be in the same project.
Ordering is not guaranteed. Rapid changes can trigger function invocations in
an unexpected order.
Events are delivered at least once, but a single event may result in
multiple function invocations. Avoid depending on
exactly-once mechanics, and write
idempotent functions .
Firestore in Datastore mode
requires Cloud Run functions (2nd gen). Cloud Run functions (1st gen) does not
support Datastore mode.
A trigger is associated with a single database. You cannot create a trigger that matches multiple databases.
Deleting a database does not automatically delete any triggers for that database. The
trigger stops delivering events but continues to exist until you delete the trigger .
If a matched event exceeds the maximum request size , the
event might not be delivered to Cloud Run functions (1st gen).
Events not delivered because of request size are logged in platform logs
and count towards the log usage for the project.
You can find these logs in the Logs Explorer with the message "Event cannot deliver to
Cloud function due to size exceeding the limit for 1st gen..." of error
severity. You can find the function name under the functionName field. If
the receiveTimestamp field is still within an hour from now, you can infer
the actual event content by reading the document in question with a
snapshot before and after the timestamp.
To avoid such cadence, you can:
Migrate and upgrade to Cloud Run functions (2nd gen)
Downsize the document
Delete the Cloud Run functions in question
You can turn off the logging itself using exclusions
but note that the offending events will still not be delivered.
Eventarc and Firestore in Datastore mode locations
Eventarc does not support multi-regions for Firestore event
triggers, but you can still create triggers for Firestore databases
in multi-region locations. Eventarc maps Firestore
multi-region locations to the following Eventarc regions:
Firestore multi-region
Eventarc region
nam5
us-central1
eur3
europe-west4
