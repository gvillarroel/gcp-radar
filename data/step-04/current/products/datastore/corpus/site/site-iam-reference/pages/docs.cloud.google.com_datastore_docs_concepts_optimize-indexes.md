This page describes concepts to consider when selecting Firestore in Datastore mode
indexes for your app.
Firestore in Datastore mode delivers high query performance by using indexes for all
queries. Performance for most queries depends on the size of
the result set and not on the total size of the database.
Firestore in Datastore mode defines built-in indexes for each property in an entity.
These single property indexes support many simple queries. Firestore in Datastore mode
supports an index merging feature that lets your database merge built-in
indexes to support additional queries. For more complex queries, you
must define composite indexes ahead of time.
This page focuses on the index merging feature, because it affects two important
index optimization opportunities:
Speeding up queries
Reducing the number of composite indexes
The following example demonstrates the index merging feature.
Filtering Photo entities
Consider a Datastore mode database
with entities of kind Photo :
Photo
Property
Value type
Description
owner_id
String
User id
tag
Array of strings
Tokenized keywords
size
Integer
Enumeration:
1 icon
2 medium
3 large
coloration
Integer
Enumeration:
1 black & white
2 color
Imagine that you require an app feature that lets users query Photo
entities based on a logical AND of the following:
Up to three filters based on the properties:
owner_id
size
coloration
A tag search string. The app tokenizes the search string into tags and adds
a filter for each tag.
For example, the app turns the search string outside, family into the query
filters tag=outside and tag=family .
Using built-in indexes and Firestore in Datastore mode's index merging feature, you can
meet the index requirements of this Photo filter feature without adding
additional composite indexes.
The built-in indexes for Photo entities support single-filter
queries like:
Python
from google.cloud import datastore
# For help authenticating your client, visit
# https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started
client = datastore . Client ()
query_owner_id = client . query ( kind = "Photo" , filters = [( "owner_id" , "=" , "user1234" )])
query_size = client . query ( kind = "Photo" , filters = [( "size" , "=" , 2 )])
query_coloration = client . query ( kind = "Photo" , filters = [( "coloration" , "=" , 2 )])
The Photo filter feature also requires queries that combine multiple equality
filters with a logical AND :
Python
from google.cloud import datastore
# For help authenticating your client, visit
# https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started
client = datastore . Client ()
query_all_properties = client . query (
kind = "Photo" ,
filters = [
( "owner_id" , "=" , "user1234" ),
( "size" , "=" , 2 ),
( "coloration" , "=" , 2 ),
( "tag" , "=" , "family" ),
],
)
Firestore in Datastore mode can support these queries by merging built-in indexes.
Index merging
Firestore in Datastore mode can use index merging when your query and your indexes
meet all of the following constraints:
The query uses only equality ( = ) filters
No composite index exists that perfectly matches the filters and
ordering of the query
Each equality filter matches at least one existing index with the same
ordering as the query
In this situation, Firestore in Datastore mode can use existing indexes to support the
query instead of requiring you to configure an additional composite index.
When two or more indexes are sorted by the same criteria, Firestore in Datastore mode can
merge the results of multiple index scans to find the results that are common to
all such indexes. Firestore in Datastore mode can merge built-in indexes, because they
all sort values by entity key.
By merging built-in indexes, Firestore in Datastore mode supports queries with equality
filters on multiple properties:
Python
from google.cloud import datastore
# For help authenticating your client, visit
# https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started
client = datastore . Client ()
query_all_properties = client . query (
kind = "Photo" ,
filters = [
( "owner_id" , "=" , "user1234" ),
( "size" , "=" , 2 ),
( "coloration" , "=" , 2 ),
( "tag" , "=" , "family" ),
],
)
Firestore in Datastore mode can also merge index results from multiple sections of the same
index. By merging different sections of the built-in index for the tag
property, Firestore in Datastore mode supports queries that combine multiple tag
filters in a logical AND :
Python
from google.cloud import datastore
# For help authenticating your client, visit
# https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started
client = datastore . Client ()
query_tag = client . query (
kind = "Photo" ,
filters = [
( "tag" , "=" , "family" ),
( "tag" , "=" , "outside" ),
( "tag" , "=" , "camping" ),
],
)
query_owner_size_color_tags = client . query (
kind = "Photo" ,
filters = [
( "owner_id" , "=" , "user1234" ),
( "size" , "=" , 2 ),
( "coloration" , "=" , 2 ),
( "tag" , "=" , "family" ),
( "tag" , "=" , "outside" ),
( "tag" , "=" , "camping" ),
],
)
The queries supported by merged built-in indexes complete the set of queries
required by the Photo filtering feature. Note that supporting the Photo
filtering feature did not require any additional composite indexes.
When selecting the optimal indexes for your app, it's important to understand
the index merging feature. Index merging gives Firestore in Datastore mode greater
query flexibility but with a possible trade-off to performance. The
next section describes the performance of index merging, and how to improve
performance by adding composite indexes.
Finding the perfect index
The index is sorted first by ancestor and then by property values, in the order specified in the index definition. The perfect composite index for a query, which allows the query to be executed most efficiently, is defined on the following properties, in order:
Properties used in equality filters
Properties used in sort orders
Properties used in distinctOn filter
Properties used in range & inequality filters (that are not already included in sort orders)
Properties used in aggregations and projections (that are not already included in sort orders and range & inequality filters)
This ensures that all results for every possible execution of the query are accounted. Firestore in Datastore mode databases execute a query using a perfect index using the following steps:
Identifies the index corresponding to the query's kind, filter properties, filter operators, and sort orders
Scans from the beginning of the index to the first entity that meets all or a subset of the query's filter conditions
Continues scanning the index, returning each entity that satisfies all the filter conditions, until it
encounters an entity that does not meet the filter conditions, or
reaches the end of the index, or
has collected the maximum number of results requested by the query
For example, consider the following query:
SELECT * FROM Task
WHERE category = 'Personal'
AND priority < 3
ORDER BY priority DESC
The perfect composite index for this query is an index of keys for entities of kind Task , with columns for the values of the category and priority properties. The index is sorted first in ascending order by category and then in descending order by priority :
indexes:
- kind: Task
properties:
- name: category
direction: asc
- name: priority
direction: desc
Two queries of the same form but with different filter values use the same index. For example, the following query uses the same index as the earlier query:
SELECT * FROM Task
WHERE category = 'Work'
AND priority < 5
ORDER BY priority DESC
For this index
indexes:
- kind: Task
properties:
- name: category
direction: asc
- name: priority
direction: asc
- name: created
direction: asc
The earlier index can satisfy both of the following queries:
SELECT * FROM Task
WHERE category = 'Personal'
AND priority = 5
ORDER BY created ASC
and
SELECT * FROM Task
WHERE category = 'Work'
ORDER BY priority ASC, created ASC
Caution: Using a perfect index can significantly increase storage size and write latency, especially in the case of exploding indexes .
Optimizing your index selection
This section describes the performance characteristics of index merging and two
optimization opportunities related to index merging:
Add composite indexes to speed up queries that rely on merged indexes
Reduce the number of composite indexes by leveraging merged indexes
Index merge performance
In an index merge, Firestore in Datastore mode efficiently
merges indexes using a
zig-zag merge join algorithm . Using this
algorithm, Datastore mode joins potential matches from
multiple index scans to produce a result set that matches a query. Index merging
combines filter components at read-time instead of write-time. Unlike most
Firestore in Datastore mode queries where performance depends only on the size of the result
set, performance for index-merge queries depends on the filters in the query and
how many potential matches the database considers.
The best-case performance of an index merge happens when every potential match
in an index satisfies the query filters. In this case, performance is O(R * I)
where R is the size of the result set and I is the number of indexes
scanned.
The worst-case performance happens when the database must consider many
potential matches but few of them satisfy the query filters. In this case,
performance is O(S) where S is the size of the smallest set
of potential entities from a single index scan.
The actual performance depends on the shape of the data. The
average number of entities considered for each result returned is
O(S/(R * I)) . Queries perform worse when many entities match each index
scan but few entities match the query as a whole, meaning R is small and S
is large.
Four things mitigate this risk:
The query planner does not look up an entity until it knows the
entity matches the entire query.
The zig-zag algorithm does not need to find all results to return the next
result. If you request the first 10 results, you only pay the latency
for finding those 10 results.
The zig-zag algorithm skips large sections of false positive results.
The worst-case performance happens only if false positive results are
perfectly interwoven (in sort order) between scans.
Latency depends on the number of entities found in each index scan, not
the number of entities that match each filter. As shown in the next section, you
can add composite indexes to improve index merge performance.
Speeding up an index-merge query
When Firestore in Datastore mode merges indexes, each index scan often maps to a single
filter in the query. You can improve query performance by adding
composite indexes that match multiple filters in the query.
Note: For brevity, this section uses a shorthand notation for index definitions.
The following definition denotes an index of kind model ,
with property prop1 ascending and prop2 descending:
Index(model, prop1, -prop2)
This is equivalent to the following configuration in index.yaml :
indexes:
- kind: model
ancestor: no
properties:
- name: prop1
- name: prop2
direction: desc
Consider this query:
Python
from google.cloud import datastore
# For help authenticating your client, visit
# https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started
client = datastore . Client ()
query_owner_size_tag = client . query (
kind = "Photo" ,
filters = [
( "owner_id" , "=" , "username" ),
( "size" , "=" , 2 ),
( "tag" , "=" , "family" ),
],
)
Each filter maps to one index scan in the following built-in indexes:
Index(Photo, owner_id)
Index(Photo, size)
Index(Photo, tag)
If you add the composite index Index(Photo, owner_id, size) , the
query maps to two index scans instead of three:
# Satisfies both 'owner_id=username' and 'size=2'
Index(Photo, owner_id, size)
Index(Photo, tag)
Consider a scenario with many large images, many black-and-white images,
but few large, panoramic images. A query filtering for both panoramic and black-and-white images will be slow if it merges built-in indexes:
Python
from google.cloud import datastore
# For help authenticating your client, visit
# https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started
client = datastore . Client ()
query_size_coloration = client . query (
kind = "Photo" , filters = [( "size" , "=" , 2 ), ( "coloration" , "=" , 1 )]
)
To improve query performance, you can lowers the value of S (smallest set
of entities in a single index scan) in O(S/(R * I)) by
adding the following composite index:
Index(Photo, size, coloration)
Compared to using two built-in indexes, this composite index produces
fewer potential results for the same two query filters. This approach
substantially improves performance at the cost of one more index.
Reducing the number of composite indexes with index merging
Although composite indexes that exactly match the filters in a query perform
best, it's not always best or possible to add a composite index for every
combination of filters. You must
balance your composite indexes against the following:
Composite index limits:
Limit
Amount
Maximum number of composite indexes for a database
200 when you have not enabled billing for your Google Cloud project.
If you need more quota, you must
enable billing for
your Google Cloud project.
1000 when you enable billing for your Google Cloud project.
You can contact support to request an
increase to this limit.
Maximum sum of the sizes of an entity's composite index entries
2 MiB
Maximum sum of the following for an entity: the number of indexed property values
the number of composite index entries
20,000
Storage costs of each additional index.
Effects on write latency.
Indexing issues often arise with multi-value fields like the tag property of
the Photo entities.
For example, imagine that the Photo filtering feature now needs to support
descending ordering clauses based on four additional properties:
Photo
Property
Value type
Description
date_added
Integer
Date/time
rating
Float
Aggregate user rating
comment_count
Integer
Number of comments
download_count
Integer
Number of downloads
If you disregard the tag field, it's possible to select
composite indexes that match every combination of Photo filters:
Index(Photo, owner_id, -date_added)
Index(Photo, owner_id, -comments)
Index(Photo, size, -date_added)
Index(Photo, size, -comments)
...
Index(Photo, owner_id, size, -date_added)
Index(Photo, owner_id, size, -comments)
...
Index(Photo, owner_id, size, coloration, -date_added)
Index(Photo, owner_id, size, coloration, -comments)
The total number of composite indexes is:
2^(number of filters) * (number of different orders) = 2 ^ 3 * 4 = 32 composite indexes
If you try to support up to 3 tag filters, the total number of composite
indexes is:
2 ^ (3 + 3 tag filters) * 4 = 256 indexes.
Indexes that include multi-value properties like
tag also lead to
exploding index issues that
increase storage costs and write latency.
To support filters on the tag field for this feature, you can reduce the total
number of indexes by relying on merged indexes. The following set of composite
indexes is the minimum required to support the Photo filtering feature with
ordering:
Index ( Photo , owner_id , - date_added )
Index ( Photo , owner_id , - rating )
Index ( Photo , owner_id , - comments )
Index ( Photo , owner_id , - downloads )
Index ( Photo , size , - date_added )
Index ( Photo , size , - rating )
Index ( Photo , size , - comments )
Index ( Photo , size , - downloads )
...
Index ( Photo , tag , - date_added )
Index ( Photo , tag , - rating )
Index ( Photo , tag , - comments )
Index ( Photo , tag , - downloads )
The number of composite indexes defined is:
(number of filters + 1) * (number of orders) = 7 * 4 = 28
Index merging also provides the
following benefits:
Allows a Photo entity to support up to
1000 tags with no limit on the number of tag filters per query.
Reduces the total number of indexes which reduces storage costs and write latency.
Selecting indexes for your app
You can select optimal indexes for your Datastore mode
database by using two approaches:
Use index merging to support additional queries
Requires less composite indexes
Reduces storage cost per entity
Improves write latency
Avoids exploding indexes
Performance depends on the shape of the data
Define a composite index that matches multiple filters in a query
Improves query performance
Consistent query performance that's not dependent on shape of data
Must stay under the limit of composite indexes
Increased storage cost per entity
Increased write latency
When figuring out the optimal indexes for your app, the answer
can change as the shape of your data changes. Sampling query
performance gives you a good idea of your app's common queries and its slow
queries. With this information, you can add indexes to improve the performance
of queries that are both common and slow.
