Indexes
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Every Firestore in Datastore mode query computes its results using one or more
indexes
which contain entity keys in a sequence specified by the index's properties
and, optionally, the entity's ancestors. The indexes are updated
to reflect any changes the application makes to its entities, so that the
correct results of all queries are available with no further computation
needed.
There are two types of indexes:
Built-in indexes
By default, a Datastore mode database automatically predefines an index for each property of each entity kind. These single property indexes are suitable for simple types of queries.
Composite indexes
Composite indexes index multiple property values per indexed entity. Composite indexes support complex queries and are defined in an index configuration file ( index.yaml ).
The types of indexes are discussed in more detail later.
Note: The index-based query mechanism supports a wide range of queries and is suitable for
most applications. However, it does not support some kinds of query common in
other database technologies: in particular, joins and aggregate queries aren't
supported within the Datastore mode query engine. See
Restrictions on queries
for limitations on Datastore mode queries.
Index definition and structure
An index is defined on a list of properties of a given entity kind , with a corresponding order (ascending or descending) for each property. For use with ancestor queries , the index may also optionally include an entity's ancestors.
An index contains entries for every property named in the index's definition. Each entry of the index represents an entity that is a potential result for queries based on the index. An entity is included in the index only if it has an indexed value set for every property used in the index; if the index definition refers to a property for which the entity has no value, that entity won't appear in the index and hence will never be returned as a result for any query based on the index.
Note: Datastore mode databases distinguish between an entity that does not possess a property and one that possesses the property with a null value ( None ). If you explicitly assign a null value to an entity's property, that entity may be included in the results of a query referring to that property.
The composite index is sorted first by ancestor and then by property values, in the order specified in the index definition. Based on this understanding, you can create the perfect index that enables efficient querying.
Index configuration
Firestore in Datastore mode provides built-in , or automatic, indexes for queries of the following forms:
Kindless queries using only ancestor and key filters
Queries using only ancestor and equality filters
Queries using only inequality filters (which are limited to a single property )
Queries using only ancestor filters, equality filters on properties, and inequality filters on keys
Queries with no filters and only one sort order on a property, either ascending or descending
As an example, by default, Datastore mode databases automatically predefine two single property indexes for each property of each entity kind, one in ascending order and one in descending order. If you don't want your database to maintain an index for a property, exclude the property from your indexes . Note that excluding a property removes it from any composite indexes.
Built-in indexes are sufficient to perform many simple queries, such as equality-only queries and simple inequality queries.
Built-in indexes don't appear in the Indexes page of the Google Cloud console.
For more complex queries, an application must define composite , or manual, indexes. Composite indexes are required for queries of the following form:
Queries with ancestor and inequality filters
Queries with one or more inequality filters on a property and one or more equality filters on other properties
Queries with a sort order on keys in descending order
Queries with multiple sort orders
Queries with one or more filters and one or more sort orders
Composite indexes are defined in the application's index configuration file ( index.yaml ). (Built-in indexes are not contained in the index configuration file.)
Composite indexes are composed of multiple properties and require that each individual property must not be excluded from your indexes .
Composite indexes are viewable in the Indexes page of the Google Cloud console. You cannot use the Google Cloud console to create or update composite indexes.
If the application tries to perform a query that cannot be executed with the available indexes (either built-in or specified in the index configuration file), the query will fail.
The Datastore mode API automatically suggests indexes that are appropriate for most applications. Depending on your application's use of your Datastore mode database and the size and shape of your data, manual adjustments to your indexes may be warranted. For example, writing entities with multiple property values may result in an exploding index with high storage costs and increased write latency.
The Datastore emulator can help make it easier to manage your index configuration file. Instead of failing to execute a query that requires an index and does not have one, the Datastore emulator
can generate an index configuration that would allow the query to succeed. If your local testing of an application exercises every possible query the application will issue, using every combination of filter and sort order, the generated entries will represent a complete set of indexes. If your testing does not exercise every possible query form, you can review and adjust the index configuration file before updating indexes.
You can learn more about index.yaml at Index Configuration .
Deploying or deleting indexes
When you are done modifying your index configuration file, run the gcloud datastore indexes create command to place the indexes into service.
Learn more at updating your indexes .
Note: If you use the appcfg.py or appcfg.sh commands to deploy an application to App Engine, the index configuration file is automatically deployed. If you use the gcloud app deploy command to deploy your application, the index configuration file is not automatically deployed. You must either specifically list index.yaml as an argument to gcloud app deploy or run gcloud datastore indexes create to deploy the index configuration file.
If you previously deployed indexes that are no longer needed, you can delete the unused indexes .
Storage costs and write latency
Indexes contribute to your storage costs. Index entry size
describes how built-in and composite indexes contribute to your database's
storage size. You can use Firestore in Datastore mode statistics
to see more information about index entries and index storage size.
Indexes also contribute to write latency. When updating a property value,
the database also updates every related index. The more indexes
the database needs to update, the longer the operation takes.
You can reduce storage costs and improve write performance by
deleting unused indexes
and excluding properties from indexing .
This also prevents operations from failing due to index limits .
Indexes and properties
Here are a few special considerations to keep in mind about indexes and how they relate to the properties of your entities:
Properties with mixed value types
When two entities have properties of the same name but different value types, an index of the property sorts the entities first by value type and then by a secondary ordering appropriate to each type. For example, if two entities each have a property named age , one with an integer value and one with a string value, the entity with the integer value always precedes the one with the string value when sorted by the age property, regardless of the property values themselves.
This is especially worth noting in the case of integers and floating-point numbers, which are treated as separate types by Datastore mode. Because all integers are sorted before all floats, a property with the integer value 38 is sorted before one with the floating-point value 37.5 .
Excluded properties
If you know you will never have to filter or sort on a particular property, you can tell your Datastore mode
database not to maintain index entries for that property by excluding it from indexes. This lowers the cost of running your application by reducing the storage size needed for index entries. This can also
improve write latency. An entity with an excluded property behaves as if the property were not set: queries with a filter or sort order on the excluded property will never match that entity.
Note: If a property appears in a composite index, then excluding the property will disable it in the composite index.
For example, suppose that an entity has properties priority and done and that you want to create an index able to satisfy queries like WHERE priority = 4 AND done = FALSE . Also suppose that you don't care about the queries WHERE priority = 4 and WHERE done = FALSE . If you exclude priority from indexes and create an index for priority and done , Datastore mode won't create index entries for the priority and done index and so the WHERE priority = 4 AND done = FALSE query won't work. For your database to create entries for the priority and done indexes, both priority and done must be indexed.
The description property in the following example is excluded from indexes:

You can later change the property back to indexed.
Note, however, that changing a property from excluded to indexed does not affect any existing entities that may have been created before the change. Queries filtering on the property won't return such existing entities, because the entities weren't written to the query's index when they were created. To make the entities accessible by future queries, you must rewrite them to your
database so that they will be entered in the appropriate indexes. That is, you must do the following for each such existing entity:
Lookup (get) the entity.
Write (put) the entity back to your database.
Similarly, changing a property from indexed to excluded only affects entities subsequently written to your database. The index entries for any existing entities with that property will continue to exist until the entities are updated or deleted. To avoid unwanted results, you must purge your code of all queries that filter or sort by the (now excluded) property.
Index limits
Firestore in Datastore mode imposes limits on the number and overall size of index entries that can be associated with a single entity. These limits are large, and most applications are not affected. However, there are circumstances in which you might encounter the limits.
As described above , a Datastore mode database creates an entry in a predefined index for every property of every entity except those you have explicitly declared as excluded from your indexes . The property may also be included in additional, custom indexes declared in your index configuration file ( index.yaml ). Provided that an entity has no list properties, it will have at most one entry in each such custom index (for non-ancestor indexes) or one for each of the entity's ancestors (for ancestor indexes). Each of these index entries must be updated every time the value of the property changes.
For a property that has a single value for each entity, each possible value needs to be stored just once per entity in the property's predefined index. Even so, it is possible for an entity with a large number of such single-valued properties to exceed the index entry or size limit. Similarly, an entity that can have multiple values for the same property requires a separate index entry for each value; again, if the number of possible values is large, such an entity
can exceed the entry limit.
The situation becomes worse in the case of entities with multiple properties, each of which can take on multiple values. To accommodate such an entity, the index must include an entry for every possible combination of property values. Custom indexes that refer to multiple properties, each with multiple values, can "explode" combinatorially, requiring large numbers of entries for an
entity with only a relatively small number of possible property values. Such exploding indexes can dramatically increase the storage size of an entity, because of the large number of index entries that must be stored. Exploding indexes also can cause the entity to exceed the index entry count or size limit.

It creates a Task entity with three values for property tags , three values for property collaborators , and created set to the current date. This will require 9 index entries, one for each possible combination of property values:
( 'fun' , 'alice' , NOW() )
( 'fun' , 'bob' , NOW() )
( 'fun' , 'charlie' , NOW() )
( 'programming' , 'alice' , NOW() )
( 'programming' , 'bob' , NOW() )
( 'programming' , 'charlie' , NOW() )
( 'learn' , 'alice' , NOW() )
( 'learn' , 'bob' , NOW() )
( 'learn' , 'charlie' , NOW() )
When the same property is repeated multiple times, Firestore in Datastore mode can detect exploding indexes and suggest an alternative index. However, in all other circumstances (such as the query defined in this example), a Datastore mode database will generate an exploding index. In this case, you can circumvent the exploding index by manually configuring an index in your index configuration file:
indexes:
- kind: Task
properties:
- name: tags
- name: created
- kind: Task
properties:
- name: collaborators
- name: created
This reduces the number of entries needed to only (|tags| * |created| + |collaborators| * |created|) , or 6 entries instead of 9:
( 'fun' , NOW() )
( 'programming' , NOW() )
( 'learn' , NOW() )
( 'alice' , NOW() )
( 'bob' , NOW() )
( 'charlie' , NOW() )
Any commit operation that would cause an index to exceed the index entry or size limit will fail. The text of the error describes which limit was exceeded ( "Too many indexed properties" or "Index entries too large" ) and which custom index was the cause. If you create a new index that would exceed the limits for any entity when built, queries against the index will fail and the index will appear in the Error state in the Google Cloud console. To handle such Error indexes,
Remove the index from your index configuration file ( index.yaml ).
Using the Google Cloud CLI, remove the index from the database using the datastore indexes cleanup command, as described in Deleting unused indexes .
Either
reformulate the index definition and corresponding queries, or
remove the entities that are causing the index to explode.
Add the index back to index.yaml .
Using the Google Cloud CLI, add the index to the database by running the datastore indexes create command, as described in Updating Indexes .
You can avoid exploding indexes by avoiding queries that would require a custom index using a list property. As described earlier, this includes queries with multiple sort orders or queries with a mix of equality and inequality filters.
Indexes for projections
Projection queries require all properties specified in the projection to be included in an index. The Datastore emulator automatically generates the needed indexes for you in the index configuration file, index.yaml , which is uploaded with your application.
One way to minimize the number of indexes required is to project the same properties consistently, even when not all of them are always needed. For example, these queries require two separate indexes:
SELECT priority, percent_complete FROM Task
SELECT priority, percent_complete, created FROM Task
However, if you always project properties priority , percent_complete , created , even when created is not required, only one index will be needed.
Converting an existing query into a projection query may require building a new index if the properties in the projection are not already included in another part of the query. For example, suppose you had an existing query like
SELECT * FROM Task
WHERE priority > 1
ORDER BY priority, percent_complete
which requires the index:
indexes:
- kind: Task
properties:
- name: priority
- name: percent_complete
Converting this to either of the projection queries
SELECT created FROM Task
WHERE priority > 1
ORDER BY priority , percent_complete
SELECT priority , percent_complete , created FROM Task
WHERE priority > 1
ORDER BY priority , percent_complete
introduces a new property ( created ) and thus will require building a new index:
indexes:
- kind: Task
properties:
- name: priority
- name: percent_complete
- name: created
However,
SELECT priority, percent_complete FROM Task
WHERE priority > 1
ORDER BY priority, percent_complete
would not change the required index, since the projected properties priority and percent_complete were already included in the existing query.
Multiple databases
You can use gcloud firestore to manage a single index for Datastore mode or use gcloud datastore with an index.yaml file to manage all the indexes under a database.
gcloud firestore
gcloud firestore indexes composite create --api-scope=datastore-mode-api --query-scope= QUERY_SCOPE --database= DATABASE_ID
gcloud datastore
gcloud alpha datastore indexes create index.yaml --database= DATABASE_ID
Replace the following:
DATABASE_ID : a database ID.
QUERY_SCOPE : either collection-recursive for ancestor indexes
or collection-group for non-ancestor indexes.
