Errors and Error Handling
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
When a Firestore in Datastore mode request is successful, the API will return an HTTP
200 OK status code along with the requested data in the body of the response.
Note: The errors and status codes described in this page are returned by the low-level
Datastore API. Note that client libraries may or may not return
these same values.
When a request fails, the Datastore API will return an HTTP
4xx or 5xx status code that generically identifies the failure as well as a
response that provides more specific information about the error(s) that caused
the failure.
The rest of this page describes the structure of an error, enumerates specific
error codes, and recommends how to handle them.
The following is the structure of an error response for a JSON request:
{
"error": {
"code": "integer",
"message": "string",
"status": "string"
}
}
The response object contains a single field error whose value contains the
following elements:
Element
Description
code
An HTTP status code that generically identifies the request failure.
message
Specific information about the request failure.
status
The canonical error code ( google.rpc.Code ) for Google APIs. Codes that may be returned by the Datastore API are listed in Error Codes .
Here's an example of an error response for a JSON request:
{
"error": {
"code": 400,
"message": "Key path is incomplete: [Person: null]",
"status": "INVALID_ARGUMENT"
}
}
If a request made with a content type of application/x-protobuf results in an
error, it will return a serialized google.rpc.Status message as the
payload.
Note: The text provided in the message could change at any time so applications
should not depend on the actual text.
Error Codes
The recommended way to classify errors is inspect the value of the
canonical error code ( google.rpc.Code ). In JSON errors, this code appears
in the status field. In application/x-protobuf errors, it's in the code
field.
Canonical Error Code
Description
Recommended Action
ABORTED
Indicates that the request conflicted with another request.
For a non-transactional commit: Retry the request or structure your entities to reduce contention. For requests that are part of a transactional commit: Retry the entire transaction or structure your entities to reduce contention.
ALREADY_EXISTS
Indicates that the request attempted to insert an entity that already exists.
Do not retry without fixing the problem.
DEADLINE_EXCEEDED
A deadline was exceeded on the server.
Retry using exponential backoff.
FAILED_PRECONDITION
Indicates that a precondition for the request was not met. The message field in the error response provides information about the precondition that failed. One possible cause is running a query that requires an index not yet defined.
Do not retry without fixing the problem.
INTERNAL
Server returned an error.
Do not retry this request more than once.
INVALID_ARGUMENT
Indicates that a request parameter has an invalid value. The message field in the error response provides information as to which value was invalid.
Do not retry without fixing the problem.
NOT_FOUND
Indicates that the request attempted to update an entity that does not exist.
Do not retry without fixing the problem.
PERMISSION_DENIED
Indicates that the user was not authorized to make the request.
Do not retry without fixing the problem.
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
Indicates that the project exceeded either its quota or the region/multi-region capacity.
Verify that you did not exceed your project quota . If you exceeded a project quota, do not retry without fixing the problem. Otherwise, retry with exponential backoff.
UNAUTHENTICATED
Indicates that the request did not have valid authentication credentials.
Do not retry without fixing the problem.
UNAVAILABLE
Server returned an error.
Retry using exponential backoff.
