Datastore queries
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A query retrieves entities from Firestore in Datastore mode that meet a specified
set of conditions.
The query operates on entities of a given kind ;
it can specify filters on the entities' property values, keys, and
ancestors, and can return zero or more entities as results . A query can also
specify sort orders to sequence the results by their property
values. The results include all entities that have at least one value for every
property named in the filters and sort orders, and whose property values meet
all the specified filter criteria. The query can return entire entities,
projected entities, or just entity keys.
A typical query includes the following:
An entity kind to which the query applies
Zero or more filters based on the entities' property values,
keys, and ancestors
Zero or more sort orders to sequence the results
When executed, the query retrieves all entities of the given kind that satisfy
all of the given filters, sorted in the specified order. Queries execute as
read-only.
Note: To conserve memory and improve
performance, a query should, whenever possible, specify a limit on the number of
results returned.
Every query computes its results using one or more indexes ,
which contain entity keys in a sequence specified by the index's properties
and, optionally, the entity's ancestors. The indexes are updated incrementally
to reflect any changes the application makes to its entities, so that the
correct results of all queries are available with no further computation
needed.
The index-based query mechanism supports a wide range of queries and is suitable
for most applications, except for non-scaling queries, such as join queries. For
more information about limitations on Datastore mode
queries, see Restrictions on queries .
Query interface
You can issue a query against a Datastore mode
database. The following example shows how to retrieve
all tasks that are not yet done with priorities greater than or equal to 4,
sorted in descending order by priority:

Query structure
A query can specify an entity kind , zero or more filters , and zero or more sort orders .
Filters
A query's filters set constraints on the properties , keys , and ancestors of the entities to be retrieved.
Property filters
A property filter specifies the following:
A property name
A comparison operator
A property value
The following example returns task entities that are marked not done:

GQL
SELECT * FROM Task WHERE done = FALSE
The property value must be supplied by the application; it cannot refer to or
be calculated in terms of other properties. An entity satisfies the filter if it
has a property of the given name whose value compares to the value specified in
the filter in the manner described by the comparison operator. If the property of
the given name is array-valued, the entity satisfies the filter if any of the values
compares to the value specified in the filter in the manner described by the comparison
operator.
The comparison operator can be any of the following:
Operator
Meaning
EQUAL
Equal to
LESS_THAN
Less than
LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL
Less than or equal to
GREATER_THAN
Greater than
GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL
Greater than or equal to
NOT_EQUAL
Not equal to
IN
Member of the specified list. Equal to any of the values in a specified list.
NOT_IN
Not a member of the specified list. Not equal to any of the values in a specified list.
Composite filters
A composite filter consists of more than one property filter. You can
combine filters with AND and OR . The following example
returns Task entities that are marked not done and have a priority of 4:

When comparing for inequality, keys are ordered by the following criteria, in order:
Ancestor path
Entity kind
Identifier (key name or numeric ID)
Elements of the ancestor path are compared similarly: by kind (string), then
by key name or numeric ID. Kinds and key names are strings and are ordered by
byte value; numeric IDs are integers and are ordered numerically. If entities
with the same parent and kind use a mix of key name strings and numeric IDs,
those with numeric IDs precede those with key names.
Queries on keys use indexes just like queries on properties and require
custom indexes in the same cases. The following exceptions don't require a custom index:
Inequality filters
Ascending sort order on the key
A descending sort order on the key requires a custom index. As with all queries, the development server creates appropriate entries in the index configuration file when a query that needs a custom index is used in the development environment.
Sort orders
A query sort order specifies the following:
A property name.
A sort direction (ascending or descending). By default the sort order is ascending.
This example sorts Task entities by creation time in ascending order:

GQL
SELECT * FROM Task ORDER BY priority DESC , created ASC
If no sort orders are specified, the results are returned in the order they
are retrieved from Datastore mode.
Restrictions
Sort orders have the following restrictions:
Because of the way Datastore mode executes
queries, if a query specifies inequality filters on a property and sort orders
on other properties, the property used in the inequality filters must be ordered
before the other properties .
If ordering is specified, the set of properties specified in the distinct on clause must appear before any non- distinct on properties in the sort orders . For more information, see grouping queries .
Sort orders on properties with equality filters are all ignored .
Special query types
Some specific types of query deserve special mention:
!= Not equal
Use the not-equal ( != ) operator to return entities where the given property
exists and doesn't match the comparison value.

GQL
SELECT * FROM Task WHERE category != 'work'
This query returns every Task entity where the category property exists
and is set to any value other than Work .
This query doesn't return entities
where the category property doesn't exist. Not-equal ( != ) and NOT_IN
queries exclude entities where the given property doesn't exist or where the
property is excluded from indexing. A property
exists when it's set to any value, including an empty string or null .
Note:
This features is available for Firestore in Datastore mode. It is not available for
pre-migration Datastore databases .
Limitations
Note the following limitations for != queries:
Only entities where the given property exists can match the query.
Only a single NOT_IN or != is allowed per query.
IN
Use the IN operator to combine up to 30 equality ( == )
clauses on the same property with a logical OR . An IN
query returns entities where the given property matches any of the comparison
values.

Limitations on Ancestor queries
Note the following limitations for Ancestor queries:
All evaluated disjunctions must have the same ancestor filter.
Kindless queries
A query with no kind and no ancestor retrieves all of the entities of an application from Datastore mode. Such kindless queries cannot include filters or sort orders on property values. They can, however, filter on entity keys and use ancestor filters. Key filters can be used by specifying __key__ as the property name:

Projection queries
Most queries return whole entities as their results, but often an
application is actually interested in only a few of the entity's properties.
Projection queries allow you to query for just those specific
properties of an entity that you actually need, at lower latency and cost than
retrieving the entire entity.
Projection queries require the specified properties to be indexed.
Keys-only queries
A keys-only query (which is a type of projection query) returns just the
keys of the result entities instead of the entities themselves, at lower
latency and cost than retrieving entire entities.
It is often more economical to do a keys-only query first, and then fetch a subset of entities
from the results, rather than executing a general query which may fetch more entities than you
actually need.
Here's how to create a keys-only query:

SELECT __key__ FROM Task
A keys-only query is a small operation and counts as only a single entity read
for the query itself.
Projections
Projection queries are similar to SQL queries of the form:
SELECT priority, percent_complete FROM Task
You can use all of the filtering and sorting features available for standard entity queries,
but note these limitations .
The example SQL query returns abridged results with only the specified properties, priority and percent_complete , populated with values; all other properties
are not populated. Here's how you construct this as a projection
query:

Not Applicable
A projection query that doesn't use the distinct on clause is a
small operation and counts as only a single entity read for the query itself.
Grouping
Projection queries can use the distinct on clause to ensure that only the
first result for each distinct combination of values for the specified
properties will be returned. This will return only the first result for entities
which have the same values for the properties that are being projected.

Aggregation queries
Firestore in Datastore mode supports the count() aggregation query. See Aggregation queries .
Range and inequality filters on multiple properties
Firestore in Datastore mode supports multiple inequality filters in a compound query. See Query using range and inequality filters on multiple properties .
Array values
Datastore mode indexes each unique array property value once per index. Thus to query if an array contains a value use
an equality filter.
Consider the following when your query includes properties with array values.
Inequality Filters
Because of the way they're indexed, entities with multiple values for the same property can sometimes interact with query filters and sort orders in unexpected and surprising ways.
If a query has multiple inequality filters on a given property, an entity will match the query only if at least one of its individual values for the property satisfies all of the filters. For example, if an entity of kind Task has values fun and programming for property tag , it will not match the query:

GQL
SELECT * FROM Task WHERE tag = 'fun' AND tag = 'programming'
even though neither of the entity's individual tag values satisfies both filter conditions.
Sort Order
Similarly, the sort order for multiple-valued properties is unusual. Because such properties appear once in the index for each unique value, the first value seen in the index determines an entity's sort order.
If a multi-valued property is not used in any filter:
and the query results are sorted in ascending order by the property, the smallest value of the property is used for ordering.
and the query results are sorted in descending order by the property, the greatest value is used for ordering.
other values don't affect the sort order, nor does the number of values.
This has the unusual consequence that an entity with property values 1 and 9 precedes an entity with values 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 in both ascending and descending order.
If a multi-valued property is used in an equality filter, any sort order on that property is ignored .
If a multi-valued property is used in an inequality or an NOT_IN filter:
and the query results are sorted in ascending order by the property, the smallest value that satisfies all of the query's inequality filters is used for ordering.
and the query results are sorted in descending order by the property, the greatest value that satisfies all of the query's inequality filters is used for ordering.
Note that if a set of inequality filters on a property translate into an equality filter, such as
WHERE tag >= 'math' AND tag <= 'math'
any sort order on that property is ignored, as the filters evaluate the same as the equality filter
WHERE tag = 'math'
Projections and array-valued properties
Projecting a property with array values won't populate all values for that
property. Instead, a separate entity will be returned for each unique
combination of projected values matching the query. For example, suppose you
have an entity of kind Task with two multiple-valued properties, tag and collaborators :

Query cursors allow an application to retrieve a query's results in convenient batches without incurring the overhead of a query offset. After performing a retrieval operation, the application can obtain a cursor, which is an opaque byte string marking the
index position of the last result retrieved. The application can save this string (for instance in your Datastore mode
database, a cache, or embedded in a web page as a base-64 encoded HTTP GET or POST parameter), and can then use the cursor as the starting point for a subsequent retrieval operation to obtain the next batch of results from the point where the previous retrieval ended. A retrieval can also specify an end cursor, to limit the extent of the result set returned.
The following example demonstrates the use of cursors for pagination:

Caution: Be careful when passing a cursor to a client, such as in a web form. Although the client cannot change the cursor value to access results outside of the original query, it is possible for it to decode the cursor to expose information about result entities, such as the project ID,
entity kind, key name or numeric ID, ancestor keys, and properties used in the query's filters and sort orders. If you don't want users to have access to that information, you can encrypt the cursor, or store it and provide the user with an opaque key.
Although Datastore mode databases support integer offsets, you should avoid using them.
Instead, use cursors. Using an offset only avoids returning the skipped entities
to your application, but these entities are still retrieved internally. The
skipped entities do affect the latency of the query, and your application is
billed for the read operations required to retrieve them. Using cursors instead
of offsets lets you avoid all these costs.
Limitations of cursors
Cursors are subject to the following limitations:
A cursor can be used only by the same project that performed the original query, and only to continue the same query. It is not possible to retrieve results using a cursor without setting up the same query from which it was originally generated.
If any of the following items are changed, a cursor can still be used for subsequent retrievals.
start cursor
end cursor
offset
limit
If any of the following items are changed, a cursor cannot be used for subsequent retrievals.
projection
kind
ancestor
filter
distinct on
sort order
An exception is if the original query's final sort order was on __key__ . In that case, you can use the cursor in a reverse query , which is the original query with each sort order reversed. The reverse query can modify the start cursor, end cursor, offset, and limit.
Cursors don't always work as expected with a query that uses an inequality filter or a sort order on a property with multiple values. The de-duplication logic for such multiple-valued properties doesn't persist between retrievals, possibly causing the same result to be returned more than once.
New Datastore mode releases may change internal implementation details, invalidating cursors that depend on them. If an application attempts to use a cursor that is no longer valid, Firestore in Datastore mode raises an exception.
Cursors and data updates
The cursor represents the location in the result list after the last result returned. A cursor is not a relative position in the list (it's not an offset); it's a marker to which a Datastore mode database can jump when starting an index scan for results. If the results for a query change between uses of a cursor, the query notices only changes that occur in results after the cursor. If a new result appears before the cursor's position for the query, it won't be returned when the results after the cursor are fetched. Similarly, if an entity is no longer a result for a query but had appeared before the cursor, the results that appear after the cursor don't change. If the last result returned is removed from the result set, the cursor still knows how to locate the next result.
When retrieving query results, you can use both a start cursor and an end cursor to return a continuous group of results. When using a start and end cursor to retrieve the results, you are not guaranteed that the size of the results will be the same as when you generated the cursors. Entities may be added or deleted from the database between the time the cursors are generated and when they are used in a query.
Restrictions on queries
The nature of the index query mechanism imposes certain restrictions on what
a query can do. Datastore mode queries don't support substring matches,
case-insensitive matches, or full-text search. Additionally, the following
restrictions apply:
Entities lacking a property named in the query are ignored
Entities of the same kind need not have the same properties. To be eligible as a query result, an entity must possess a value (possibly null) for every property named in the query's filters and sort orders. If not, the entity is omitted from the indexes used to execute the query and consequently won't be included in the query's results.
Note: It is not possible to query for entities that are specifically lacking a given property. One alternative is to add the property with a null value, then filter for entities with null as the value of that property.
Filtering on unindexed properties returns no results
A query can't find property values that aren't indexed, nor can it sort on such properties. For more information, see Unindexed properties .
Limits on inequality filters
To prevent queries from becoming too expensive to run, Firestore in Datastore mode limits the number of range or inequality properties to 10.
For more information on queries with inequality filters, see Query using range and inequality filters on multiple properties .
You can't use both NOT_EQUAL and NOT_IN s
If you use the NOT_IN , you can't also add a
NOT_EQUAL clause.
Ordering of query results is undefined when no sort order is specified
When a query doesn't specify a sort order, the results are returned in the order they are retrieved. As the Datastore mode implementation evolves (or if a project's indexes change), this order may change. Therefore, if your application requires its query results in a particular order, be sure to explicitly specify that sort order in the query.
Sort orders are ignored on properties with equality filters
Queries that include an equality filter for a given property ignore any sort
order specified for that property. This is an optimization to save
needless processing for single-valued properties. Since all results have the
same value for the property, no further sorting is needed. Multiple-valued
properties, however, may have additional values besides the one matched by the
equality filter. Because this use case is rare and applying the sort order would
be expensive and require extra indexes, the Datastore mode query
planner ignores the sort order even in the multiple-valued case. This may
cause query results to be returned in a different order than the sort order
appears to imply. For example, the sort order is ignored in the following query:

SELECT * FROM Task WHERE tag IN ARRAY ( 'learn' , 'study' ) ORDER BY tag ASC
For ascending order, the smallest value that satisfies the filter is used for ordering.
For descending order, the greatest value that satisfies the filter is used for ordering.
Other values don't affect the sort order and nor does the number of values in the property.
Properties used in inequality filters must be sorted first
To retrieve all results that match an inequality filter, a query scans the index for the first row matching the filter, then scans forward until it encounters a non matching row. For the consecutive rows to encompass the complete result set, they must be ordered by the property used in the inequality filter before any other properties. Thus if a query specifies one or more inequality filters along with one or more sort orders, the first sort order must refer to the same property named in the inequality filters.

OrderBy and existence
When you order a query by a given property, the query can return only the
entities where the order-by property exists.
For example, the following query wouldn't return any entities where the
priority property is not set, even if they otherwise meet the query filters.
Java
Query<Entity> query =
Query . newEntityQueryBuilder (). setKind ( "Task" )
. setFilter ( PropertyFilter . eq ( "done" , false ))
. setOrderBy ( OrderBy . desc ( "priority" ))
. build ();
A related effect applies to inequalities. A query with an inequality filter
on a property also implies ordering by that property. The following
query doesn't return entities without a priority property even
if starred = true in that entity. As a workaround, you can execute
separate queries for each ordering or you can assign a value for all properties
that you order by.
Java
Query<Entity> query =
Query . newEntityQueryBuilder ()
. setKind ( "Task" )
. setFilter ( CompositeFilter . or (
PropertyFilter . eq ( "starred" , true )),
PropertyFilter . ge ( "priority" , 4 ))
. build ();
The earlier query includes an implied order-by on the inequality such as the
following. The direction of the implied order-by depends on available indexes:
Java
Query<Entity> query =
Query . newEntityQueryBuilder ()
. setKind ( "Task" )
. setFilter ( CompositeFilter . or (
PropertyFilter . eq ( "starred" , true )),
PropertyFilter . ge ( "priority" , 4 )
)
. setOrderBy ( OrderBy . asc ( "priority" ))
. build ();
Limitations on projections
Projection queries are subject to the following limitations:
Only indexed properties can be projected.
This means that all properties used in a query (projected or filters) must
exist in the same index. So, select tag from Task where priority = 1 requires
a composite index on priority then tag.
Projection is not supported for strings that are longer than 1500 bytes,
byte arrays that have more than 1500 elements, and other properties
explicitly marked as unindexed.
The same property cannot be projected more than once.
Properties referenced in an equality filter cannot be projected.
For example,
SELECT tag FROM Task WHERE priority = 1
is valid (projected property not used in the equality filter), as is
SELECT tag FROM Task WHERE tag > ' fun `
(not an equality filter), but
SELECT tag FROM Task WHERE tag = ' fun `
(projected property used in equality filter) is not.
Results returned by a projection query shouldn't be saved back to your Datastore mode database.
Because the query returns results that are only partially populated, you
shouldn't write them back to the Datastore mode database.
Projection queries convert timestamps into integers.
In the results of a projection query, Datastore mode converts
timestamp values to microsecond integer values.
