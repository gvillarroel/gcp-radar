Configure Cloud IDS
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Use these instructions to configure Cloud IDS for your application. For
conceptual information about Cloud IDS, see the
Cloud IDS overview .
Before you begin
Before you configure Cloud IDS, you must complete the following requirements.
Set up IAM permissions for Cloud IDS
Cloud IDS has several Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. You can use the example
commands to grant a principal the necessary IAM permissions.
Cloud IDS Admin role ( roles/ids.admin ). Project principals with
this role can create IDS endpoints. If you are a project owner,
you already have this permission and don't need an explicit
ids.admin role to create IDS endpoints.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role=roles/ids.admin \
--member=user: USER_NAME ;
This role enables the following operations:
Create endpoint
Delete endpoint
Get endpoint
List endpoint
Cloud IDS Viewer role ( roles/ids.viewer ). Project viewers and
principals with this role have read-only access to IDS endpoints. If you are a
project owner, editor, or viewer, you already have this permission.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role=roles/ids.viewer \
--member=user: USER_NAME ;
Compute packet mirroring user role ( roles/compute.packetMirroringUser ). A role
needed to attach a packet mirroring policy to the IDS endpoint. If you have the
compute.securityAdmin or container.serviceAgent role, you already have
this permission. For more information about this role, see the
IAM basic and predefined roles
reference .
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role=roles/compute.packetMirroringUser \
--member=user: USER_NAME ;
Logs Viewer role ( roles/logging.viewer ). An additional role needed
to view recent threats, which is a critical core feature of Cloud IDS.
For more information about this role, see the
Access control guide .
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role=roles/logging.viewer \
--member=user: USER_NAME ;
In addition, you need the following miscellaneous permissions:
compute.regions.list
compute.zones.list
Set up private services access
To create IDS endpoints, you must enable the Service Networking
API, and set up network peering for the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. This
only needs to be done once per customer project and can be done by using the
Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI. When you allocate an IP address range,
it must be an RFC 1918-compliant private IP address range ( 10.0.0.0/8 ,
172.16.0.0/12 , or 192.168.0.0/16 ), or endpoint creation fails.
Use the following steps to set up private services access:
Enable the Service Networking API by using the following command. Replace
PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Allocate an IP range for Google services in your VPC network.
If you have already configured private services access for another service,
you must allocate a separate, unique IP address range for
Cloud IDS.
In the following command, you can omit the addresses field and
Google Cloud selects an unused address range in your VPC
network:
gcloud compute addresses create RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \
--global \
--purpose=VPC_PEERING \
--addresses=192.168.0.0 \
--prefix-length=16 \
--description=" DESCRIPTION " \
--network= VPC_NETWORK
Replace the following:
RESERVED_RANGE_NAME : a name for the allocated range,
such as my-allocated-range
DESCRIPTION : a description for the range, such as
allocated for my-service
VPC_NETWORK : the name of your VPC
network, such as my-vpc-network
Create a private connection to a service producer. The private connection
establishes a VPC Network Peering
connection between your VPC network and the service producer's
network.
If you already have an existing private connection, use the
gcloud services vpc-peerings update command
to update it with the additional range that you allocated for Cloud IDS:
gcloud services vpc-peerings update \
--service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--ranges= RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \
--network= VPC_NETWORK \
--project= PROJECT_ID
If you don't already have a private connection, use the
gcloud services vpc-peerings connect command .
This command initiates a long-running operation that returns an operation name.
gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
--service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--ranges= RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \
--network= VPC_NETWORK \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
RESERVED_RANGE_NAME : the name of one or more
allocated ranges
VPC_NETWORK : the name of your VPC
network
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that contains
your VPC network
To check whether the operation was successful, use the
gcloud services vpc-peerings operations describe command :
gcloud services vpc-peerings operations describe \
--name= OPERATION_NAME
Replace OPERATION_NAME with the operation name
that was returned from the previous step.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each VPC network that you want to monitor.
Optional: Enable VPC Service Controls
After private services access is enabled, you can optionally enable
VPC Service Controls on Cloud IDS.
If enabled, run the services vpc-peerings enable-vpc-service-controls command
to enable VPC Service Controls for all your peering connections:
gcloud services vpc-peerings enable-vpc-service-controls \
--service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--network= VPC_NETWORK \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
VPC_NETWORK : the name of your VPC network
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that contains your
VPC network
Understand best practices
We recommend that you understand the best practices before you configure
Cloud IDS. For more information, see Best practices for
Cloud IDS .
Configure Cloud IDS endpoints
The following sections explain how to create Cloud IDS endpoints,
attach them to a Packet Mirroring policy, view the Cloud IDS
endpoints, delete the Cloud IDS endpoints, and how to
configure threat exceptions.
Create a Cloud IDS endpoint
We recommend that you create an IDS endpoint for every region in which you have
deployed workloads. You can also create multiple IDS endpoints per region. Use
the following steps to create an IDS endpoint and assign it an IDS service
profile.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to IDS Endpoints .
Go to IDS Endpoints
Configure the endpoint:
Click Create endpoint .
Enter a name in the Endpoint name field.
Optional: Enter a description in the Description field.
Click the Network list, and select the network that you
want Cloud IDS to inspect.
Choose the region and zone of your network or subnet from the Region
and Zone lists.
Click Continue .
Select the Cloud IDS service profile:
Click Select IDS service profile .
Under Minimum threat severity level , select the correct alert level.
Click Create . The creation process can take 10-15 minutes.
gcloud
Optional flags
The commands in this section might have some or all of the following
optional flags:
--no-async
Wait for the operation in progress to complete, rather than returning immediately.
--filter=EXPRESSION
Apply a Boolean filter EXPRESSION to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed. For more
details and examples of filter expressions, run the gcloud topic filters
command .
This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
--flatten , --sort-by , --filter ,
--limit .
--limit=LIMIT
The maximum number of resources to list. The default is unlimited. This flag
interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
--flatten , --sort-by , --filter ,
--limit .
--page-size=PAGE_SIZE
Cloud IDS groups resource-list output into pages. This flag
specifies the maximum number of resources per page. The default is
determined by the service if it supports paging; otherwise, it is unlimited
(no paging). Paging can be applied before or after the --filter
and --limit flags, depending on the service.
--sort-by=[FIELD,…]
A comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The default
order is ascending. Prefix a field with a tilde ( ~ ) for descending order on that
field. This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
--flatten , --sort-by , --filter ,
--limit .
--uri
Print a list of resource URIs instead of the default output.
--threat-exceptions
A comma-separated list of threat IDs to exempt from alerting on this
endpoint. Limited to 99 exceptions per endpoint.
Instructions
To create a new IDS endpoint, use the
gcloud ids endpoints create command .
gcloud ids endpoints create ENDPOINT_NAME \
--network= VPC_NETWORK \
--zone= ZONE \
--severity= SEVERITY \
[--no-async] \
[GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG...]
Replace the following:
ENDPOINT_NAME : the name or ID of the endpoint.
VPC_NETWORK : the name of your VPC network.
ZONE : the zone of the endpoint.
SEVERITY : the minimum severity of threats to report on.
The severity flag is required, and takes one of the following values:
INFORMATIONAL
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
API
Cloud IDS endpoint resources have the following fields:
Field
Type
Field description
createTime
string
[Output only] Creation timestamp in RFC 3339 text format.
updateTime
string
[Output only] Last update timestamp in RFC 3339 text format.
name
string
[Output only] Name of the endpoint in the format projects/{project_id}/locations/{locationId}/endpoints/{endpointId} .
network
string
Name of the VPC network that is connected to the IDS
endpoint. This can either contain the VPC network name
itself (like "src-net" ) or the full URL to the network
(like "projects/{project_id}/global/networks/src-net" ).
This field is required when creating the endpoint.
severity
string
The minimum alert severity level that is reported by the endpoint.
Possible values are as follows:
INFORMATIONAL
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
CRITICAL
This field is required when creating the endpoint.
description
string
An optional description of the endpoint.
endpoint_forwarding_rule
string
[Output only] URL of the endpoint's network address to which traffic
is to be sent by Packet Mirroring.
endpoint
string
[Output only] Internal IP address of the endpoint's network entry point.
To create a Cloud IDS endpoint, use an HTTP POST request like the
following, replacing variables as appropriate. The
ENDPOINT_NAME must be between 1-63 characters; must
only contain lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens; must start with a
lowercase letter; and cannot end with a hyphen.
POST https://ids.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NAME /locations/ ZONE /endpoints?endpointId= ENDPOINT_NAME
{
"network": " NETWORK_NAME ",
"severity": " SEVERITY_LEVEL ",
}
Important: After your endpoint is created, you must attach a packet mirroring
policy to it to begin inspecting traffic.
Attach a Packet Mirroring policy to a Cloud IDS endpoint
Use the following steps to attach a Packet Mirroring policy to the IDS endpoint.
Console
After the IDS endpoint is created, attach a Packet Mirroring
policy to the IDS endpoint:
In the Google Cloud console, go to IDS Endpoints .
Go to IDS Endpoints
Next to the IDS endpoint, click Attach .
In the Policy name field, enter a name for the Packet Mirroring policy.
Click Next .
Choose the subnet or instances to mirror. You can select multiple subnets
and instances.
Click Next .
Determine whether you want to mirror all traffic or filter traffic:
If you want to mirror all traffic, ensure that Mirror All Traffic is selected.
If you want to filter traffic based on protocol, IP address range, or
ingress or egress traffic, select Mirror filtered traffic :
Select either Allow all protocols or Allow specific protocols .
Select either Allow all IP ranges or Allow specific IP ranges .
Click Submit . The endpoint is created.
gcloud
After the endpoint has been created, attach a Packet Mirroring policy
to it. First, obtain the URL from the endpoint_forwarding_rule field by using
the following command:
gcloud ids endpoints describe ENDPOINT_NAME
Create the Packet Mirroring policy by using the following command:
gcloud compute packet-mirrorings create POLICY_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--collector-ilb= ENDPOINT_FORWARDING_RULE \
--network= VPC_NETWORK \
--mirrored-subnets= SUBNET
Packet Mirroring has several optional flags, including those that you can
use to filter traffic based on protocol, IP address range, or ingress or
egress traffic. For more information about these optional flags, see the
Packet Mirroring reference .

[--filter= EXPRESSION ] \
[--limit= LIMIT ] \
[--page-size= PAGE_SIZE ] \
[--sort-by=[ FIELD , ... ]] \
[--uri] \
[GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG...]
Replace the following:
EXPRESSION : apply a Boolean filter to each resource item to be listed. If
the expression evaluates True, then that item is listed.
LIMIT : the maximum number of resources to list.
PAGE_SIZE : the maximum number of resources per page.
FIELD : a comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by.
API
To list all Cloud IDS endpoints in a zone, use an HTTP GET request like
the following, replacing variables as appropriate:
