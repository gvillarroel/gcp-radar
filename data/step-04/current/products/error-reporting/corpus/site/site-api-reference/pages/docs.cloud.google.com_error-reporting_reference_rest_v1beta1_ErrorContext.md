JSON representation
HttpRequestContext
JSON representation
SourceLocation
JSON representation
SourceReference
JSON representation
A description of the context in which an error occurred. This data should be provided by the application when reporting an error, unless the error report has been generated automatically from Google App Engine logs.
JSON representation
{
"httpRequest" : {
object ( HttpRequestContext )
} ,
"user" : string ,
"reportLocation" : {
object ( SourceLocation )
} ,
"sourceReferences" : [
{
object ( SourceReference )
}
]
}
Fields
httpRequest
object ( HttpRequestContext )
The HTTP request which was processed when the error was triggered.
user
string
The user who caused or was affected by the crash. This can be a user ID, an email address, or an arbitrary token that uniquely identifies the user. When sending an error report, leave this field empty if the user was not logged in. In this case the Error Reporting system will use other data, such as remote IP address, to distinguish affected users. See affectedUsersCount in ErrorGroupStats .
reportLocation
object ( SourceLocation )
The location in the source code where the decision was made to report the error, usually the place where it was logged. For a logged exception this would be the source line where the exception is logged, usually close to the place where it was caught.
sourceReferences[]
object ( SourceReference )
Source code that was used to build the executable which has caused the given error message.
HttpRequestContext
HTTP request data that is related to a reported error. This data should be provided by the application when reporting an error, unless the error report has been generated automatically from Google App Engine logs.
JSON representation
{
"method" : string ,
"url" : string ,
"userAgent" : string ,
"referrer" : string ,
"responseStatusCode" : integer ,
"remoteIp" : string
}

method
string
The type of HTTP request, such as GET , POST , etc.

string
The IP address from which the request originated. This can be IPv4, IPv6, or a token which is derived from the IP address, depending on the data that has been provided in the error report.
SourceLocation
Indicates a location in the source code of the service for which errors are reported. functionName must be provided by the application when reporting an error, unless the error report contains a message with a supported exception stack trace. All fields are optional for the later case.
JSON representation
{
"filePath" : string ,
"lineNumber" : integer ,
"functionName" : string
}
Fields
filePath
string
The source code filename, which can include a truncated relative path, or a full path from a production machine.
lineNumber
integer
1-based. 0 indicates that the line number is unknown.
functionName
string
Human-readable name of a function or method. The value can include optional context like the class or package name. For example, my.package.MyClass.method in case of Java.
SourceReference
A reference to a particular snapshot of the source tree used to build and deploy an application.
JSON representation
{
"repository" : string ,
"revisionId" : string
}
Fields
repository
string
Optional. A URI string identifying the repository. Example: "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes.git"
