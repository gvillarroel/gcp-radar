JSON representation
ErrorGroupStats
JSON representation
TimedCount
JSON representation
Contains a set of requested error group stats.
JSON representation
{
"errorGroupStats" : [
{
object ( ErrorGroupStats )
}
] ,
"nextPageToken" : string ,
"timeRangeBegin" : string
}
Fields
errorGroupStats[]
object ( ErrorGroupStats )
The error group stats which match the given request.
nextPageToken
string
If non-empty, more results are available. Pass this token, along with the same query parameters as the first request, to view the next page of results.
timeRangeBegin
string ( Timestamp format)
The timestamp specifies the start time to which the request was restricted. The start time is set based on the requested time range. It may be adjusted to a later time if a project has exceeded the storage quota and older data has been deleted.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
ErrorGroupStats
Data extracted for a specific group based on certain filter criteria, such as a given time period and/or service filter.
JSON representation
{
"group" : {
object ( ErrorGroup )
} ,
"count" : string ,
"affectedUsersCount" : string ,
"timedCounts" : [
{
object ( TimedCount )
}
] ,
"firstSeenTime" : string ,
"lastSeenTime" : string ,
"affectedServices" : [
{
object ( ServiceContext )
}
] ,
"numAffectedServices" : integer ,
"representative" : {
object ( ErrorEvent )
}
}
Fields
group
object ( ErrorGroup )
Group data that is independent of the filter criteria.
count
string ( int64 format)
Approximate total number of events in the given group that match the filter criteria.
affectedUsersCount
string ( int64 format)
Approximate number of affected users in the given group that match the filter criteria. Users are distinguished by data in the ErrorContext of the individual error events, such as their login name or their remote IP address in case of HTTP requests. The number of affected users can be zero even if the number of errors is non-zero if no data was provided from which the affected user could be deduced. Users are counted based on data in the request context that was provided in the error report. If more users are implicitly affected, such as due to a crash of the whole service, this is not reflected here.
timedCounts[]
object ( TimedCount )
Approximate number of occurrences over time. Timed counts returned by ListGroups are guaranteed to be:
Inside the requested time interval
Non-overlapping, and
Ordered by ascending time.
firstSeenTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Approximate first occurrence that was ever seen for this group and which matches the given filter criteria, ignoring the timeRange that was specified in the request.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
lastSeenTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Approximate last occurrence that was ever seen for this group and which matches the given filter criteria, ignoring the timeRange that was specified in the request.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
affectedServices[]
object ( ServiceContext )
Service contexts with a non-zero error count for the given filter criteria. This list can be truncated if multiple services are affected. Refer to numAffectedServices for the total count.
numAffectedServices
integer
The total number of services with a non-zero error count for the given filter criteria.
representative
object ( ErrorEvent )
An arbitrary event that is chosen as representative for the whole group. The representative event is intended to be used as a quick preview for the whole group. Events in the group are usually sufficiently similar to each other such that showing an arbitrary representative provides insight into the characteristics of the group as a whole.
TimedCount
The number of errors in a given time period. All numbers are approximate since the error events are sampled before counting them.
JSON representation
{
"count" : string ,
"startTime" : string ,
"endTime" : string
}
Fields
count
string ( int64 format)
Approximate number of occurrences in the given time period.
startTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Start of the time period to which count refers (included).
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
endTime
string ( Timestamp format)
End of the time period to which count refers (excluded).
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
