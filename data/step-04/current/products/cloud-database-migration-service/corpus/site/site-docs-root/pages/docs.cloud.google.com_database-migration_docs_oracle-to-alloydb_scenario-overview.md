Oracle to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL migration overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
With Database Migration Service, you can convert your Oracle database schema,
tables, and code objects to PostgreSQL syntax, and then migrate
data from your Oracle databases to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.
Database Migration Service offers support for multiple different Oracle
offerings, including Bare Metal Solution, Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC),
and self-managed instances.
This page provides an overview of the key Database Migration Service features
for heterogeneous Oracle to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL migrations:
Supported source and destination lists all Oracle
versions supported by Database Migration Service.
Code and schema conversion describes how Database Migration Service
can help you convert your schemas, tables, and other objects from
Oracle syntax to PostgreSQL syntax.
Continuous migrations data flow provides an end-to-end overview
of how your data moves in Google Cloud during the migration process.
Monitoring
gives an introduction for logs and metrics that can
help you observe the progress and health of your migration job.
Migration security looks at encryption features offered by
Database Migration Service.
Supported source and destination databases
Database Migration Service supports the following Oracle databases as migration sources:
Amazon RDS for Oracle
Self-hosted deployments, including:
Oracle Single Instance Database Deployment
Oracle Exadata
Oracle Active Data Guard
Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC)
Full support also depends on your source Oracle version.
The following table lists all supported versions for heterogeneous Oracle migrations:
Source databases
Destination databases
Oracle 11g, Version 11.2.0.4
AlloyDB for PostgreSQL 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
Oracle 12c, Version 12.1.0.2
Oracle 12c, Version 12.2.0.1
Oracle 18c
Oracle 19c
Oracle 21c
Unsupported source databases
Database Migration Service doesn't support migrating from Oracle Autonomous Database.
Code and schema conversion
Database Migration Service conversion workspaces provide an interactive editor experience
where you can convert your schemas, tables, and other objects from
Oracle syntax to PostgreSQL syntax. Interactive conversion workspaces
also provide support for Gemini-assisted workflows with code
explainability and conversion issue fixing.
To learn more, see
Conversion workspaces .
Migration data flow
For heterogeneous Oracle migrations to PostgreSQL,
Database Migration Service supports continuous and one-time migration flows.
With continuous migrations, your data is first loaded from a full dump, and then
continuously updated based on data change information surfaced from
database log files . One-time migrations only involve the
full dump phase.

At a high level, your data moves through the migration phases as follows:
One-time migrations
You use Database Migration Service conversion workspace to convert your schemas,
tables, and other objects from Oracle syntax to PostgreSQL syntax.
Oracle databases can often have several thousand objects
whose schema you need to convert. With Database Migration Service, you can divide your
work into multiple phases. Database Migration Service can connect to your source
databases and pull the required schema information when needed.
When you finish translating all your entities to PostgreSQL syntax,
you apply the schema to the databases in the destination instance.
The goal of this stage is to prepare your destination databases so that
Database Migration Service can later replicate the data from source tables to their
correct equivalents in AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.
Once your schema is applied, you can begin the data migration.
The full dump phase is the only part of the one-time migration
process. During this phase, Database Migration Service connects to your source
instance, reads the contents of the tables you selected for migration,
and then loads the data to the AlloyDB for PostgreSQL destination instance.
For one-time migrations, we recommend that you disable writes on the
source database during the full dump phase. This way you can avoid
avoid losing data created after the migration process starts.
When the full dump phase is over, you can promote the destination
database and switch your application to use the new destination database.
Continuous migrations
You use Database Migration Service conversion workspace to convert your schemas,
tables, and other objects from Oracle syntax to PostgreSQL syntax.
Oracle databases can often have several thousand objects
whose schema you need to convert. With Database Migration Service, you can divide your
work into multiple phases. Database Migration Service can connect to your source
databases and pull the required schema information when needed.
When you finish translating all your entities to PostgreSQL syntax,
you apply the schema to the databases in the destination instance.
The goal of this stage is to prepare your destination databases so that
Database Migration Service can later replicate the data from source tables to their
correct equivalents in AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.
Once your schema is applied, you can begin the data migration.
The full dump phase is the first part of the migration process.
There are two ways in which you can complete full dump:
Automatic: Database Migration Service connects to your source instance, reads
the contents of the tables you selected for migration, and then loads
the data to the AlloyDB for PostgreSQL destination instance.
In this phase, Database Migration Service captures actual contents of your
database.
Manual: You can skip the full dump phase and perform it yourself
outside Database Migration Service. If you do, you can start the migration
process with the change data capture (CDC) phase by providing an
Oracle System Change Number as the starting point for replication.
For continuous migrations, when the full dump phase is over,
Database Migration Service switches to the CDC phase . During CDC,
Database Migration Service keeps monitoring your source databases for changes,
and then continuously replicates them on the destination instance.
In the CDC phase, Database Migration Service doesn't copy actual data from your source
tables: instead, it reads information extracted from
database log files
to replicate changes in the destination. For more information about this
mechanism, see
Change Data Capture .
You can stop the ongoing replication and promote the migration job when you want
to switch your application so that it uses the AlloyDB for PostgreSQL
destination instance as the production database.
For a detailed, step-by-step migration guide, see
Oracle to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL migration guide .
Monitoring
Figure 2. Sample observability chart displaying replication delay in a Database Migration Service migration job. (click to enlarge)
Database Migration Service provides extensive logging and observability capabilities
to help you monitor the migration progress. These features include real-time
diagnostics for replication delay and CDC progress,
as well as detailed logs for AlloyDB for PostgreSQL destination instance health
and migration job state.
For more details, see
Migration job metrics .
Migration security
Database Migration Service provides multiple encryption mechanisms you can use
for additional security during the migration process. These mechanisms include:
SSL/TLS certificates for encrypting the network connections between
Database Migration Service and source databases. For more details, see
Encryption overview .
Encryption certificates for securing data movement during full dump and CDC
phases. For more details, see
CMEK for migration jobs .
