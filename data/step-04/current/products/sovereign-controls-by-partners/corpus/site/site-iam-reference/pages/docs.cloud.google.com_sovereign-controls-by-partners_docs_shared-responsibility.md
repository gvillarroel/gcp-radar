This page describes shared responsibility in Sovereign Controls by Partners. For
general information about shared responsibility in Google Cloud, see
Shared responsibilities and shared fate on Google Cloud .
Shared responsibility for data
You're the expert in knowing the security and regulatory requirements for your business and
knowing the requirements for protecting your confidential data and resources. When you run your
workloads on Google Cloud, you must identify the security controls that you need to configure
in Google Cloud to help protect your confidential data and each workload. To decide which
security controls to implement, you must consider the following factors:
Your regulatory compliance obligations
Your organization's security standards and risk management plan
Security requirements of your customers and your vendors
The protection of your data is a primary design consideration for all of Google's
infrastructure, products, and personnel operations. Google Cloud provides strong security for
many data types, including Customer Data and
Service Data . However, if your workloads must meet
specific regulatory requirements or are subject to national standards that require elevated security
controls, your internal policies may differ from default configuration options. If you have such
requirements, we recommend adopting additional tools and techniques to help maintain your required
level of compliance and enable your team to follow the best practices of data management and overall
cybersecurity management.
Configure Google Cloud and Sovereign Controls by Partners for shared responsibility
The following areas are customer responsibilities as a user of any public cloud:
Understanding what portions of your data have different compliance and security requirements.
Most cloud customers have some IT infrastructure which requires general commercial security, and
some customers have specific data, such as health data, which must meet a higher compliance
requirement. Sovereign Controls by Partners can help to meet those higher compliance requirements. Place any
sensitive or regulated data with specific access or residency requirements inside appropriate
Sovereign Controls by Partners folders or projects and keep it there.
Configuring Identity and Access Management (IAM) to ensure that the contents of your organization
are accessed and modifiable by the appropriate personnel.
Creating and organizing your organizational hierarchy such that it does not expose personal
data.
Ensuring you have read all documentation to understand and follow best practices.
Sharing information prudently during technical support sessions and troubleshooting, and
not placing or sharing sensitive or regulated data outside compliant Sovereign Controls by Partners
folders.
The scope of sensitive or regulated data can vary depending on many factors including regulations
you or your customers are subject to and can include:
Account information
Health information
Personal identifiers for customers or users
Cardholder data
ID numbers
Google's responsibilities in the shared responsibility model
In the shared responsibility partnership between Google and customers, Google takes
responsibility for the foundational elements and infrastructure of building a successful cloud
business, some of which rely on customers undertaking their responsibilities to configure
Google Cloud to adequately protect their data. Examples of Google's responsibilities
include:
Applying default encryption and
infrastructure controls .
Enforcing the IAM policies that you set to restrict workload administration and
data access to the identities that you identify.
Configuring and enforcing any customer-selected Sovereign Controls by Partners controls associated with your
selected compliance regime, for the protected data types in the resources you have configured it
for. This includes restrictions on where data will be stored and which Google employees can have
access to your data in the course of their appropriate business activities.
Providing configurations and controls through Sovereign Controls by Partners for regulated industries and
locationally sensitive data.
Providing
Organization policies and
resource settings that let
you configure policies throughout your hierarchy of folders and projects.
Providing Policy Intelligence tools that give
you insights on access to accounts and resources.
Configuration specific to Europe and the EU
When using Sovereign Controls by Partners, customers have additional technical controls on
top of the GDPR assurances made on Google Cloud that they can use to adjust their data
residency and security controls as part of their compliance efforts. Some of these controls
include:
An EU data boundary as further described in
Data residency .
Support routing to EU persons in EU locations, including subprocessors.
Visibility into Administrative Access requests and accesses.
Policy-driven access approvals (Sovereign Controls only).
Custom options for data encryption and key management.
Examples of common fields that are not recommended for sensitive or regulated data
We strongly recommend all regulated and sovereign customers to exercise caution when inputting
data into Google Cloud services. It's critical to avoid adding sensitive or regulated data
into common input fields that may not be protected by technical controls or aren't included in the
Sovereign Controls by Partners technical control boundary. This practice is necessary to maintain compliance with
regulatory requirements and safeguards your sensitive or regulated information. To assist you, we
compiled a list of examples across various Google Cloud services where extra vigilance is
required.
Avoid placing your sensitive or regulated data in the following common fields:
Resource names and IDs
Project or folder names and IDs
Any description fields or labels
Log-based metrics
VM sizes and similar service configurations
URIs or file paths
Timestamps
User IDs
Firewall rules
Security scanning configurations
Customer IAM policies
