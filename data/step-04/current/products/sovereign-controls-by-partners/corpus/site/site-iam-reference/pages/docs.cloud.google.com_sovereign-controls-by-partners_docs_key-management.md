Maintain partner-managed keys
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: This page only applies for customers who are using manually-created
partner-managed keys. If you created a
coordinated external key for Cloud EKM ,
your keys can be rotated by following the steps in
Rotate a coordinated external key .
As a Sovereign Controls by Partners customer, you use a different workflow
to manage your Cloud External Key Manager (Cloud EKM) keys. Instead of setting up and
managing your own external key manager, Google Cloud and the partner handle
these steps for you. This means that the partner manages your keys and key
versions at your request.
This page describes how to submit requests for common key operations in a
partner-managed Cloud Key Management Service project, commonly known as the
Key Management Project .
Before you begin
You need to have a key ring with at least one key before making key operation
requests.
Get the key's resource name
For any key operation request, you need to
provide the resource name
of the key or key version to be modified.
You need to provide the key resource name to create a version or rotate a
key.
You need to provide the key version resource name to update or destroy a
key version.
Issue Tracker requests
Issue Tracker is a tool used by Google and its partners to track requests for
specialized projects. For partner-managed Cloud Key Management Service projects, you
use the Issue Tracker to submit requests to the partner who then fulfills
requests in your Cloud Key Management Service project and manages your keys in the external key
manager.
You can find a link to your organization's Issue Tracker in your welcome email.
Common key operations
Create a key version
Use the Issue Tracker to submit a request for a new key version. The new key
version is set as the primary version if it's the first key version, or if there
are no other key versions.
In the Issue Tracker, select Create key version and provide the resource
name of your key. Click Create to submit your request.
Rotate key
In the Issue Tracker, indicate Rotate key in the ticket body and provide the
resource name of your key. Click Create to submit your request.
When a key is rotated, the partner generates new key material in the EKM,
creates a new key version in your Cloud Key Management Service project, and then sets the new
key version as the primary version.
Rotating a key version causes all newly-created data protected with that key to
be encrypted with new key material. Data protected with previous key material is
not re-encrypted. As a result, your previous key material needs to remain
available for use.
Disable a key version
You can use the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or a Cloud KMS
client library to disable a key version in the Enabled state. When you
disable a key version, its state changes to Disabled . See
Enabling and disabling key versions in the
Cloud KMS documentation for more information.
Note: Key versions in the Disabled state are billed as active key versions.
Destroy a key version
Caution: Destroying a key is a permanent operation that can cause unrecoverable
data loss. All key destruction actions will be permanent, and once destroyed,
the key will be unrecoverable by you, the partner, or Google. Data that
was encrypted with the key cannot be accessed.
To destroy a key version,
schedule the key version for destruction in
Cloud KMS. This destroys the Cloud KMS key and data encrypted
by the key will no longer be accessible.
If you'd also like to destroy the key in the partner's EKM:
Schedule the key version for destruction .
In the Issue Tracker, select Destroy key version in the ticket body and
provide the resource name of the key version you would like to have
destroyed.
Click Create to submit your request.
The partner confirms your key destruction request with you before
proceeding. When destruction is confirmed, the partner provides a date
and time for when the key will be destroyed. You can restore the key before the
destruction.
In the period before the key is destroyed, if you
restore your key version , both the
Cloud KMS key and the key in the partner's EKM will remain.
If the destruction continues as scheduled, the Cloud KMS key is deleted
first, and then the key in the partner's EKM is deleted.
Note: Destroying a key version is not supported if your partner uses
Thales Ciphertrust key manager (CCKM), you can only destroy the key and all its
key versions.
Response time
Use the Issue Tracker for routine key management operations only. Once an Issue
Tracker request is submitted, you can expect to receive a response from your
partner within one business day.
