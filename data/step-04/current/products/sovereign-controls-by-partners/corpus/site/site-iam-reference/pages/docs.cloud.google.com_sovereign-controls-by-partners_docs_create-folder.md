Create a partner-managed folder
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page guides you through creating a new folder for
Sovereign Controls by Partners. You must create this folder before
creating any other resources that are intended for use with
Sovereign Controls by Partners.
Before you begin
Before you can create a new folder, ensure that you've done the following:
Completed onboarding to Google Cloud and received an email instructing you to
create a partner-managed folder.
If your organization enforces the iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains
organization policy constraint, you must allow the following additional domain
IDs before creating your Sovereign Controls by Partners folder:
The partner's Google Cloud organization ID or Google Workspace customer ID
Google's customer ID, which is C02h8e9nw
By allowing these IDs, your partner and Google can grant IAM
roles in your organization as necessary to manage your workloads. If your
partner hasn't provided their organization ID or customer ID during the
onboarding process, request it from them. If you attempt to create a folder
before allowing these IDs, the operation fails with the following error:
One or more users named in the policy do not belong to a permitted customer.
See the
Restricting identities by domain
page for more information about updating the iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains
constraint.
Ensure that you understand the restrictions and limitations associated with
the data boundary that your partner is offering.
Create a new folder
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Assured Workloads page.
Go to Assured Workloads
If prompted, select your organization.
Click add_box CREATE to go to the
Create an Assured Workloads folder page.
Note: Sovereign Controls by Partners is an
Assured Workloads offering, and shares similar capabilities and
features.
In the step to Add folder details :
In Folder name , enter a unique name for the folder, such as
aw-my-folder-name . The folder name must be a minimum of 4
characters in length and a maximum of 30, and can only contain letters,
numbers, spaces, and hyphens.
Tip: When you name your
Assured Workloads folders for
Sovereign Controls by Partners, consider the following:
To identify the folder as an Assured Workloads folder,
include a prefix in its name (such as aw- ). This
identifier can help you locate the folder from a list of other
resources. If you have existing Assured Workloads
folders, consider using another naming convention to
differentiate your Sovereign Controls by Partners folder
from them.
Don't include sensitive data or personally identifiable
information (PII) in the folder name.
In Organization , select the organization in which to create
your folder. This location can't be changed later.
In Folder location , select the location in the resource
hierarchy where the folder will be created. A
Sovereign Controls by Partners folder can be created as a child
of an organization or of another folder.
Click Next .
In the step to Choose a control package option , select
Sovereign Controls .
Select your partner-managed solution from the drop-down menu.
Select a sub-billing account if your partner created one for you.
In Select resource location , choose the
location where
resource creation and usage will be enforced by the folder's
organization policy .
Review the details about your selections and click Next .
In the step to Configure additional settings , you must create a
new project and a key ring for your
Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) . No
keys are created during this step, as Sovereign Controls by Partners
doesn't automatically create any cryptographic keys for you.
Note : Once your key management project has been
created, complete the steps to create a
coordinated external key .
When you create a coordinated external key for Cloud EKM, note that
manually created key versions aren't automatically set as the primary key
version. To set it as a primary key, see
Rotate a key .
Depending on which sovereign partner you've chosen, you may have an
additional Manage partner permissions step. In this step, you can
choose to grant your partner access to the following data:
Monitoring : This includes permissions to view
Assured Workloads monitoring
information about your folder. This includes any unresolved or resolved
compliance violations, and any exceptions you've granted for those
violations.
Access Transparency and emergency access logs : This includes
permissions to view Access Transparency logs and emergency access logs for
your folder.
Access Transparency support case details : This includes
permissions to include additional support case details used as an
access reason within Access Transparency logs for your folder. Permission for
Access Transparency and emergency access logs is needed for this permission to
take effect.
Access Approval information : This includes permissions
to view Access Approval logs for your folder.
For more information about how these permissions are granted or revoked, see
the Partner permissions section.
After you've made your selections, click Next .
In the step to Review and create folder , review the details about
your new Sovereign Controls by Partners folder and ensure that they are
correct. Then, click Create Folder .
After completing these steps, Sovereign Controls by Partners creates
the following resources:
A Sovereign Controls by Partners folder, which enforces security
controls on
supported Google Cloud products
to adhere with the your partner offering. These controls include setting an
organization policy that
restricts resource usage
to only those supported products, and allows creating or using resources only
in
allowed locations .
A CMEK project that contains the configured CMEK key ring.
Note : Folder creation does not automatically
create keys for you. After creating the folder, you must create an
encryption key before adding any resources.
Partner permissions
If you choose to grant your partner access to
Assured Workloads monitoring
and access history data, you can revoke this access at any time. To grant or
revoke access for all types of data, complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Assured Workloads page.
Go to Assured Workloads
Click the name of your Sovereign Controls by Partners folder to view
the folder's details.
From the Assured Workloads Folder Details page, click the
Configure Partner Permissions button in the
info Partner permissions
section.
In the Configure partner permissions panel, select the checkboxes to
grant or revoke permission for each type of data, and then click Save .
Your partner's access to this data will be granted or revoked depending on your
selections.
Monitoring
To enable partner access to your folder's Assured Workloads monitoring
data, an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role is granted to
the Cloud Controls Partner Service Agent . Like
all service agents , the Cloud
Controls Partner Service Agent acts on behalf of Sovereign Controls by Partners. It is visible
in the IAM policy for your Sovereign Controls by Partners folder, and uses the
following email format, where FOLDER_ID is the ID of that folder:
service-folder-[ FOLDER_ID ]@gcp-sa-cloudcontrolspartner.iam.gserviceaccount.com
The service agent is granted the
Cloud Controls Partner Monitoring Service Agent
( roles/cloudcontrolspartner.monitoringServiceAgent ) IAM role on
your folder. See the
IAM reference
for more information about this role and its permissions.
