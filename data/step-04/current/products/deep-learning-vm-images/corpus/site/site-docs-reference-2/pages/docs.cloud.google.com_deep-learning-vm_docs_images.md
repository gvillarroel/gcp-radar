Choose an image
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Specific Deep Learning VM Images images are available to suit your choice of
framework and processor. There are currently images
supporting PyTorch and generic high-performance
computing, with versions for GPU-enabled workflows.
To find the image that you want, see the table below.
Deciding on an image family
Choose a Deep Learning VM image family based on the framework
and processor that you need.
The following table lists the most recent versions of image families,
organized by framework type.
To get the most recent version of an image, create an instance
by referencing an image family with latest in the name.
If you need a specific framework version, skip to Supported framework
versions .

Choosing an operating system
Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 are supported OS versions, and the images come with the NVIDIA driver version 580.
They are denoted by the -ubuntu-2204-nvidia-580 and -ubuntu-2404-nvidia-580
suffixes in the image family name (see Listing all available
versions ).
Debian images have all been deprecated.
All active images support A3 Ultra GPU accelerators.
PyTorch images
PyTorch image families provide a Google Cloud
optimized distribution of PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning.
Specifying an image version
You can reuse the same image even if the latest image is newer. This can be
useful, for instance, if you are trying to create a cluster and you
want to ensure that any images that are used to create new instances are
always the same. You should not use the name of the image family in this
situation because, if the latest image is updated, you'll have different images
on some instances in your cluster.
Instead, you can determine what the exact name of the image is, incorporate
the version number, and then use that specific image to spawn new instances in
your cluster.
To find out the exact name of the latest image, use the following command in
the Google Cloud CLI with your preferred terminal or in
Cloud Shell . Replace
IMAGE_FAMILY with the image family name for which you want
to find out the latest version number.
gcloud compute images describe-from-family IMAGE_FAMILY \
--project deeplearning-platform-release
Look for the name field in the output and use the image name given there
when creating new instances.
Supported framework versions
Deep Learning VM supports each framework version based on a schedule to
minimize security vulnerabilities. Review the Deep Learning VM framework
support policy to understand the
implications of the end-of-support and end-of-availability dates.
If you need a specific framework or CUDA version, see the following tables. To
find a specific VERSION_DATE for an image, see Listing
the available versions .

After deprecation
When images reach the End-of-patch and support date , they are deprecated.
Deprecation means that these images are removed from public visibility and
it's encouraged to use supported images to help ensure security and performance.
If your Deep Learning VM image is deprecated or reaches its
end of availability, we highly recommend that you migrate to a newer,
supported image. This helps make sure you continue to receive critical
security patches and the latest features. Consider the following forms
of migration:
If there is a newer, supported image in the same image family, we
recommend upgrading your image to a supported version of the
same image family.
If there are no newer, supported images in the same image family, consider
a newer, supported framework from a different VM image family.
Use an image after deprecation
If you must use an image after deprecation against Google security
recommendations and at your own risk , you must specify an image from the
image family when you create the VM instance.
To list images from an image family name after its end of patch and
support date, include the --show-deprecated flag in your
gcloud compute images list command, or select Show deprecated images
when creating an instance in the Google Cloud console. See List all available
versions using gcloud CLI .
To create a Deep Learning VM instance that uses a deprecated image,
see the following example gcloud CLI command:
gcloud compute instances create deprecated-tf-vm \
--image = projects/deeplearning-platform-release/global/images/ IMAGE_NAME \
--machine-type = n1-standard-4 \
--zone = us-east1-c
Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of the image, as follows:
To use a specific image in the image family, use the image name, for example:
pytorch-2-9-cu129-ubuntu-2204-nvidia-580-v20260416 .
List all available versions using gcloud CLI
You can also list all available Deep Learning VM images using the
following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud compute images list \
--project deeplearning-platform-release \
--format="value(NAME)" \
--no-standard-images
Note: The output of this command includes some image family framework types
that aren't mentioned in the previous table of family names .
These are image families that aren't updated anymore.
Image families are named in the format
FRAMEWORK - CUDA_VERSION - OS ,
where FRAMEWORK is the target library,
CUDA_VERSION is the version of the CUDA stack,
and OS denotes the operation system with the
pre-installed NVIDIA driver.
For example, an image from the family
pytorch-2-9-cu129-ubuntu-2204-nvidia-580 has
PyTorch 2.9, CUDA 12.9, and the OS is Ubuntu 22.04 with NVIDIA driver 580
pre-installed.
What's next
Create a new Deep Learning VM instance
using the Cloud Marketplace
or using the command line .
