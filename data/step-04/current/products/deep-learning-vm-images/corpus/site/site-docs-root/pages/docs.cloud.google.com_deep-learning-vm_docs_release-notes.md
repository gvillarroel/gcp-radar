Feature
M129 release
Updated the Dataproc JupyterLab plugin to version 0.1.85.
March 12, 2025
Feature
M128 release
Except for TensorFlow images, new images don't include conda. This change was made to improve size, performance, and vulnerability management. The existing image names and image family names now point to images and image families that don't include conda (for example: the image name common-cpu-v20250310-debian-11-py310 and corresponding image family name common-cpu-debian-11-py310 ).
Images that include conda will be available until at least September 30, 2025. These images now have -conda appended to the name (for example: the image name common-cpu-v20250310-debian-11-py310-conda and corresponding image family name common-cpu-debian-11-py310-conda ).
All TensorFlow images and image families still include conda, but M128 image names and image family names have -conda appended. Specifying images or image families without -conda appended references older images, which also include conda.

M88 release
To help address the Apache Log4j 2 vulnerability, H2O has been updated to 3.34.0.6 in the R and Theia images. This addresses CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 . See the official H2O update .
Change
As previously announced in the M87 release and M71 release , the previous format of TensorFlow 2.x image names, tf2-xxx-2-y-zzz , is unavailable starting with this release. Please use the current format of tf-xxx-2-y-zzz for image names.
Issue
Images from the M88 release mistakenly have M87 metadata stored in the images. For example, the welcome message upon terminal login for the base CPU image shows "Version: common-cpu.m87". This mistaken metadata is also shown in the version field in notebook Custom metadata . Users can verify they are actually using the M88 images by looking for v20211219 in the image name of the boot disk. After clicking the image, users can also verify if the image has the label release : m88 . Other than the mistaken metadata, users can use the M88 images as normal.
Feature
Starting with this release, the Python packages that are installed on each image are listed in files that are available on Cloud Storage.
December 06, 2021
Feature
M87 release

Change
The M87 release is the last release in which TensorFlow 2.x image names are available in two formats: the current standard, tf-xxx-2-y-zzz and the previous standard, tf2-xxx-2-y-zzz . For example, both tf-ent-2-7-cpu and tf2-ent-2-7-cpu are available although they are the same images. The next release will only contain TensorFlow 2 images named with the current standard, as originally announced in the M71 release notes from June 2021 .
