Carbon Footprint reporting methodology
This page explains the background, high-level methodology, and technical
details behind the customer-specific greenhouse gas emissions reports
provided by Carbon Footprint. Any future changes to data sources
and methodology are captured in the Release Notes.
About Carbon Footprint reporting
To help customers run their business with as light a footprint as possible,
Google Cloud offers Carbon Footprint. It provides visibility for each
customer into the climate impacts of
products purchased from Google Cloud
so that customers can report on and take action to reduce those impacts.
Google Cloud customers generally use a diverse portfolio of
Google Cloud products in multiple regions, making the tracking of their
workloads' carbon footprint complex. To give customers a report tailored to
their specific carbon footprint, Google looks at the carbon emissions
produced by the computing infrastructure supporting its internal services.
Google allocates those emissions to each Google Cloud product,
and allocates the emissions to a customer based on the customer's usage of those
Google Cloud products.
The Google Cloud customer-specific greenhouse gas emissions data provided
by the Carbon Footprint report has not been third-party verified
or assured. Any updates to our methodology or the data sources might
result in material changes to our calculations and might result in the
current and previous Google Cloud customer-specific greenhouse gas
emissions data provided by the Carbon Footprint report to be adjusted.
Behind the methodology
Carbon Footprint reports are prepared according to the widely
recognized
Greenhouse Gas Protocol carbon reporting and accounting standards
(GHGP), which provide detailed guidance for emission reports.
As Google Cloud allocates its emissions (including Google Cloud's Scope
1, 2, and 3) to all customers based on usage, customers can then integrate the
allocated Google Cloud emissions data into their own reports as Scope 3
emissions (indirect emissions related to the value chain).
Carbon Footprint uses the GHGP's location-based and market-based reporting standards in reports and dashboards.
Location-based scope 2 emissions data represent emissions arising from all electricity
generation sources in use at a given location. Location-based emissions data don't
take into account Google's renewable power purchase agreements or other contracts for
carbon-free electricity. As such, these metrics help customers understand how their
Google Cloud product choices and use patterns affect greenhouse gas emissions
without factoring in Google's carbon-free electricity purchases.
Market-based scope 2 emissions data includes the impact of Google's carbon-free
electricity purchases to the appropriate data centers according to the GHGP's
market-based method and standards. Google Cloud customers seeking to compile annual
Scope 3 emissions inventories for their own products and services will likely find the
market-based footprint most useful.
Carbon Footprint builds its calculations from bottom-to-top, relying
heavily on machine-level power and activity monitoring inside Google data
centers. This lets us allocate emissions to the internal services that
are directly using these machines or driving machine purchasing decisions. This
level of granularity ultimately enables us to allocate emissions to customers based
on their specific usage.
In addition to the different ways that location-based and market-based emissions
data account for Google's carbon-free electricity purchases, Carbon Footprint
also uses different granularity levels of the emission factors when estimating
location-based and market-based emissions:
Hourly greenhouse gas emission factors are used to calculate location-based
emissions. That is because the electricity generators supplying electricity to the
grid are constantly changing; an hourly greenhouse gas emission factor takes into
account the mix of generation sources in use hour-by-hour. When matched with hourly
electricity load data, this calculation method produces an emissions figure that is
sensitive to the relationship between electricity demand on the grid and the resources
called to supply it. The increased granularity of the emissions calculation is more
suitable for optimizing workload location and timing to reduce your operational
greenhouse gas emissions.
Annual greenhouse gas emission factors are used to calculate market-based
emissions. That is because these are the emissions factors that are most often
used in other Scopes of corporate greenhouse gas accounting. These emissions
factors combined with the impact of Google's carbon-free electricity purchases
makes it a suitable data source for including in reported Scope 3 emissions
inventories.
Using machine-level data and hourly emission factors is a new approach and therefore
these emissions reports have not yet been third-party verified or assured. Whereas
Google annually obtains third-party assurance
from an independent, accredited auditor for Google's top down footprint, the data
streams and processes required to produce these customer reports have not been
similarly verified or assured. However, a third party performed a detailed review
of our methodology for calculating and allocating GHG emissions arising from Google Cloud products to individual customers per GHG Protocol to critique and
improve our work, and we look forward to further refinements as this effort matures.

Methodology
The Google Cloud customer-specific carbon footprint report (the
"Carbon Footprint report"), is calculated automatically. This section
describes how Google Cloud makes those calculations.
Key concepts
Google Cloud is a shared computing platform. Its compute
resources -- processing power, memory, storage, networking, etc. -- are
shared across Google Cloud customers.
Google is organized around units of functionality called
internal services. An internal service is a particular software
functionality that's run on Google's data center machines.
Google Cloud products use internal services and are consumed as
customer-facing product units (SKUs) .
Electricity use is one of Google Cloud's largest sources of greenhouse
gas emissions. Data centers consolidate compute resources into shared
buildings. These buildings consume electricity to run the computing
equipment and additional power for lights, cooling, power systems, and
other ancillary needs.
Electricity is provided by a wide variety of generation plants
operating on individual grids all over the world. The greenhouse gases
arising from electricity generation vary with the generation fuel (e.g.,
natural gas, coal, wind, sun, water) among other factors. Each grid's
generation sources differ, and within a grid, the sources will differ over
the course of a day.
Disaggregating Google Cloud's electricity use and its resulting carbon footprint to specific products and customers presents a technical
conundrum. Determining a customer's footprint is very complex due to the
layers of shared resources called upon to serve customer compute needs.
Developing new allocation methodologies and assumptions (as discussed in
detail below) enables Google Cloud to present customer footprint reports
that are appropriate and representative of each customer's cloud computing
use and product choices.
Calculation summary
Carbon Footprint first calculates energy use as a function of compute
usage and data center resource requirements. Then, Carbon Footprint calculates location-based and market-based
carbon emissions from electricity use, and allocates those emissions across
customers and further across each customer's purchased products. The carbon
emissions from electricity per customer and product are then augmented with
proportional allocations of emissions arising from the non-electricity sources.
The market-based emissions metrics match Google's
clean electricity purchases to relevant data center loads to establish regional
market-based electricity emission factors wherever Google purchases clean
energy. In the market-based emission reports, the regional market-based
emission factors replace the location-based emission factors.
Energy use and allocation to internal services
In order to allocate the total machine energy usage to internal services,
Google separately evaluates the energy used when running a workload ("dynamic
power") against the energy used when machines are idle ("idle power"). Each
machine's hourly dynamic power is allocated to the internal services it
supported that hour, based on relative internal service CPU usage. Machine
idle power is allocated to each internal service based on its resource
allocation (CPU, RAM, SDD, HDD) in the data center.
Overhead energy use–power systems, cooling and lights–is allocated hourly to
every machine, and its users, based on the machine's total energy use that hour.
Google's shared infrastructure services track the usage of other
internal services that call them. This enables the shared infrastructure
services' energy usage to be reallocate to those internal services based
on their relative usage. For some internal services that don't have
sufficient usage data, Google uses internal costs to reallocate the shared
infrastructure's energy consumption.
When these calculations and allocations are complete, we have hourly power use
allocated to each internal service in each data center.
Energy consumption associated with each customer's usage is available for
customers participating in a private preview.
Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity: location-based calculations
Google calculates location-based greenhouse gas emissions on an hourly basis by
multiplying location-specific energy use by a grid electricity carbon emission
intensity factor. This reflects the actual mix of power sources (fossil fuels,
renewables, etc.) feeding into the grid in the location of energy consumption.
Notably, location-based Scope 2 emissions don't account for energy purchasing
choices or contracts – like energy attribute certificates (EACs) or power
purchase agreements (PPAs).
The hourly grid carbon emission intensity data incorporated into
Carbon Footprint reports encompasses only the emissions associated with
electricity generation; it does not include other lifecycle stages.
The hourly emission factor data is provided by
Electricity Maps .
Where Electricity Maps data is unavailable, Google uses country-specific annual
average carbon emission intensity factors published by the
International Energy Agency .
To calculate emissions, Google multiplies the hourly energy use for each
internal service at each location by the appropriate carbon emission
intensity factor for that hour and location to determine the
internal service's location-based electricity carbon footprint per hour and
location.
Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity: market-based calculations
The market-based electricity footprint is estimated by matching Google's clean
electricity purchases to relevant data-center loads according to GHGP standards.
Google calculates its market-based emissions on an annual basis, taking into
account the actual generation of our clean electricity contract facilities and
the electricity used at each site. This calculation uses publicly-available
annual emissions factors from government sources, published by the International
Energy Agency.
In each region where we purchase clean electricity, a market-based annual emissions
total is calculated for Google's data centers. The location-based electricity
emissions are scaled down using the ratio of the previous year's renewable
electricity percentage in the region. This scaling factor is multiplied by the
granular location-based emissions calculations in the appropriate region to create
monthly market-based emission reports broken down by customer and product.
The market-based scaling factor is updated once per year, as it relies on the
market-based emissions calculations for Google as a whole. For this reason, the
market-based emission reports don't provide a dynamic view of Google's electricity
purchases and renewable generation at any given time; rather, they are representative
of our renewable energy activity from the previous year.
The GHGP Scope 2 guidance limits zero-emission claims from purchased clean energy
to those instances where the clean energy is generated and then used in the same
geographic region and within a reasonable timespan.
Note that the emission factors differ between location-based and market-based emissions data.
Hourly greenhouse gas emission factors are used to calculate location-based
emissions. That's because the electricity generators supplying electricity to the
grid are constantly changing; an hourly greenhouse gas emission factor takes into
account the mix of generation sources in use hour-by-hour. When matched with hourly
electricity load data, this calculation method produces an emissions figure that is
sensitive to the relationship between electricity demand on the grid and the resources
called to supply it. The increased granularity of the emissions calculation is more
suitable for optimizing workload location and timing to reduce your operational
greenhouse gas emissions.
Annual greenhouse gas emission factors are used to calculate market-based emissions.
That's because these are the emissions factors that are most often used in other
Scopes of corporate greenhouse gas accounting. These emissions factors combined with
the impact of Google's carbon-free electricity purchases makes it a suitable data
source for including in reported Scope 3 emissions inventories.
Electricity footprint allocation to SKUs
Every Google Cloud product is consumed as
customer-facing product units ,
identified by their unique SKUs. Google links each SKU to the
internal service that provides it (which often has a one-to-one mapping to
the equivalent Google Cloud product). Not all Google Cloud products are
covered by the Carbon Footprint report
because this mapping isn't always possible. SKU usage is the primary means of
allocating each Google Cloud product's total electricity carbon footprint
amongst its customers.
Google first quantifies each SKU's emissions footprint. An internal service's
carbon footprint is divided amongst its SKUs proportional to their usage
(quantity purchased) and list prices (all in US dollars), while also accounting
for different carbon intensities in each location where the internal service
is deployed. This allocation is solved as a series of equations that satisfy
the following principles:
SKUs for a given internal service deployed in the same location
have carbon footprints that are proportional to their list price
A specific SKU for a specific internal service, deployed in multiple
locations, has different carbon footprints in each location,
proportional to the grid carbon intensity in each location
The aggregated footprint of all the SKUs within each
internal service is equal to the total carbon footprint of the
internal service, plus some overhead for certain activities that are
not accounted for in the internal service allocations described above.
The carbon electricity footprint aggregated across all SKUs is equal to the total
Google Cloud location-based electricity carbon footprint.
Electricity footprint allocation to customers
Solving these equations results in a total carbon footprint for each SKU
in each region where the SKU is deployed. The last step for
electricity calculations is to allocate the SKU regional carbon
footprints to specific customers, aggregated into meaningful units (products,
projects, regions). Here's an overview of this process:
First, each SKU's carbon footprint is divided by the total SKU
usage (volume metric) for a given region to establish each SKU's per-usage
carbon intensity factor for that region.
Each customer's usage of each SKU in each region is then multiplied by
the respective SKU carbon intensity factor. This results in a per-SKU,
per-region, per-customer footprint.
The customer SKU footprints are then aggregated into customer-specific
Google Cloud product footprints to increase the confidence in the
reported carbon emission numbers.
Finally, the data is aggregated to a monthly granularity to minimize
daily fluctuations. The resulting report includes a customer specific location-based electricity
carbon footprint that is totalized overall per month, with breakdowns per
Google Cloud product, per customer-defined project, and per region.
Note that there is validation performed to ensure the aggregation of all the
customer electricity carbon footprints is equal to the total Google Cloud
location-based electricity carbon footprint.
Non-electricity emission sources
While emissions from electricity production represent the majority of
Google Cloud's carbon emissions, other emission sources do contribute to the total.
Carbon Footprint uses data streams for these non-electricity sources
that originate with Google company-wide emissions inventory. As such, emissions
from non-electricity sources are calculated and added to the Google Cloud
footprint on a less dynamic and less granular basis than emissions from electricity.
While we measure electricity use and associated location-based emissions on an
hourly basis, emissions from other sources are established on either a monthly or
annual basis, and are not available with any geographic specificity. Note that
the Google company-wide data for embodied emissions of data center equipment and
data center facilities has not been assured.
To allocate company-wide emissions from non-electricity sources to the
customer-specific breakdowns in Carbon Footprint reports, we establish an
allocation factor – a ratio of the customer's Google Cloud electricity use to
the total Google Cloud electricity use – and multiply that factor by the
worldwide Google Cloud emissions from each source, determined as described here.
Embodied emissions of data center equipment: This emission source
encompasses the activities necessary to extract, refine, and transport
materials to equipment manufacturing locations, and the emissions associated
with the manufacturing processes. Using lifecycle analysis, Google has
established a per-piece embodied emissions footprint for data center
equipment. This footprint is then amortized over a 4-year timeframe
(chosen to match our financial accounting standards though we see
significantly longer lifetimes for our equipment in practice) to create an
annual emissions burden for each piece of equipment.
The total number of machines resident in Google data centers and the summed
emissions of all equipment is updated monthly by adding the new machines
and dropping those at the 4-year mark.
Embodied emissions of data center facilities: This emission source
encompasses the activities necessary to extract, refine, and transport
materials to data center construction locations, and the emissions
associated with the construction itself - including site infrastructure such
as coolant systems and power systems. Using lifecycle analysis, Google has
established a data center construction emissions footprint, which is then
scaled up or down based on the size (data capacity) of new data center
additions. This scaled footprint is then amortized over a 20-year timeframe
(chosen to match our financial accounting standards).
On a monthly basis, Google adds newly available building capacity to its
running calculation of embodied facility emissions.
Fossil fuels combusted onsite: This emission source encompasses all data
center onsite fuels use, for example for backup power, water and space
heating, and transportation (fleet vehicles). On an annual basis, Google
collects all relevant records and sums its total data center fuels use and
calculates the resulting carbon footprint as part of its annual emission
reporting process.
The total data center fuel emissions number is updated annually for
Carbon Footprint calculations.
Data center employee commuting and business travel: This emission source
encompasses travel and commuting associated with employees who work at Google
data centers. On an annual basis, Google collects travel records and
estimates of employee commute modes, in each case creating a worldwide total
emissions footprint for the activity. This worldwide Google total is then
downscaled to data center employees by multiplying the proportion of data
center employees vs. Google's total employee count, to create the data
center emissions total.
The total data center commute and travel emissions number is updated
annually for Carbon Footprint calculations.
Technical details
Electricity use
This section describes Google's method for bottoms-up energy consumption
calculations.
First, every machine runs workloads for one or more internal services.
Google records the internal services using each machine, on an hourly basis.
Similarly, Google also records power use by machine, on an hourly basis.
A machine's power use will be a mix of power used to execute workloads (dynamic
power), and power used when the machine is idle (idle power). There are two
different methods to allocate these machine-level power uses to the
internal service level:
Each machine's hourly dynamic power is allocated to the
internal services it supported during that hour. When a workload is
running, the major resource contributor to energy consumption is CPU usage.
Google monitors CPU usage inside its data centers per machine and
internal service workload. If one internal service is using the
machine, it allocates the machine's dynamic energy consumption to that
internal service. If a machine supported more than one
internal service, Google allocates the dynamic power proportional to
the CPU usage of each internal service running on the machine.
Idle energy consumption is allocated to Google internal services
based on each internal service's resource allocation in the data
center. An important driver of machines at idle is the desire to have
compute resources (CPU, RAM, HDD, SDD) "at the ready" to execute uncertain
but potentially large workloads without delay or interruption. Idle power
is distributed based on the level of compute resources that has been
purchased, whether or not the internal service is using those
resources. This allocation results in idle power allocations per
internal service, for each data center location.
Data center electric overhead load (power systems, cooling, lights) is then
allocated to every machine within the data center. Google measures this load at
the building level and estimates it more finely at the sub-building level, using
validated algorithms as part of Google's Power Usage Effectiveness monitoring
system. The sub-building estimates are allocated across the sub-building
sector's deployed machines in the same proportions as the completed dynamic and
idle power allocations.
Next, the power required by the shared infrastructure services software layer
is allocated based on the usage of those infrastructure services by higher-level
internal services. Overhead load for shared infrastructure services is
included in their allocations. These allocations remain at the
internal service (not machine) level.
For the internal services that don't have sufficient usage data, Google
uses back-charged costs between the internal services to reallocate the
shared infrastructure's energy consumption. For example, Artifact Registry uses
Cloud Storage. So, the fraction of Cloud Storage's energy use
that is reallocated to Artifact Registry is Artifact Registry's cost for using
Cloud Storage's service divided by Cloud Storage's total
costs. Some internal services are revenue-neutral. If an
internal service is revenue-neutral or revenue-positive, all of its energy
use will be reallocated to the other internal services that use it.
Greenhouse gas emissions
This section describes
Electricity Maps'
calculation.
Grid carbon emission factors begin with electricity generation data from
balancing authorities. This data provides the intraday energy mix, which is the
relative production of electricity by the different electricity plants available
on the grid. Electricity Maps then adds the real-time electricity import and
export between interconnected grids.
Finally, Electricity Maps uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
(2014) electricity generation emission factors for each electricity generation
source (e.g. coal, natural gas, hydropower, etc.) to create a volume-weighted
hourly carbon intensity factor (emissions per megawatt-hour generated) for each
electric grid. You can review Electricity Maps' carbon intensity factors
here .
Note that Electricity Maps does not provide data for all Google Cloud locations,
with particular gaps in Asia. Where such data is unavailable, Google uses
country-specific annual average carbon intensity factors published by the
International Energy Agency.
Google maps the relevant carbon emission intensity factors to each of its
Cloud locations .
We then multiply the hourly energy use for each internal service at
each location, by the appropriate carbon emission intensity factor for that
location to determine the internal service's location-based carbon footprint per hour
and location. Each internal service's footprint is summed every
24 hours to create a daily footprint for that internal service
in each location. These location-based footprints are summed daily into a
internal service footprint per Google Cloud region, as well as a worldwide
total.
Allocation to SKUs and customers
Each internal service's location-based emissions are allocated to Google Cloud
product units available for customer purchase (SKUs), and then the SKU location-based
footprints are aggregated to Google Cloud product for the purpose of
customer reports.
Every Google Cloud product comprises one or more customer-facing units
available for purchase and identified by unique SKUs (see
all Google Cloud SKUs ).
For example, Cloud Storage is a service and Cloud Storage " Standard
Storage Finland ", " Nearline Storage Finland ", " Coldline Storage Finland"
and " Archive Storage Finland " are SKUs representing different classes of
storage of the Cloud Storage service in Finland (see
all the Cloud Storage SKUs ).
Google Cloud uses "SKUs purchased" as the primary means of allocating each
Google Cloud product's total location-based carbon footprint amongst Google Cloud
customers. It helps to note that most Google Cloud SKUs are volumetric. For
example, some storage SKUs are priced and purchased on a per-terabyte basis.
The volume quantity of a customer's purchase of any given product (which we call
"SKU usage") is an important factor in data center obligations and load.
