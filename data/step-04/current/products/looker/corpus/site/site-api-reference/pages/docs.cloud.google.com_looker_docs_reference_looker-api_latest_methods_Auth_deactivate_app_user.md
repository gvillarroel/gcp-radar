Deactivate OAuth App User
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Version 4.0.26.6 (latest)
Deactivate an app for a user
Deactivate a user for a given oauth client app. All tokens issued to the app for
this user will be invalid immediately. Before the user can use the app with their
Looker account, the user will have to read and accept an account use disclosure statement for the app.
Admin users can deactivate other users, but non-admin users can only deactivate themselves.
As with most REST DELETE operations, this endpoint does not return an error if the indicated
resource (app or user) does not exist or has already been deactivated.
