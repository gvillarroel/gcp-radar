Manage configuration settings
BigQuery administrators and project owners can manage
configuration settings at the organization and project levels. You can set
configurations to enforce security, control costs, and optimize query
performance across your entire data infrastructure. By setting default values,
you can ensure consistent compliance and operational efficiency, making it
easier to manage your BigQuery environment.
The following sections describe how to specify default configuration
settings. Default settings are configured at an organization or project level
but can be overridden at the session or job level.
Required roles
To get the permission that
you need to specify a configuration setting,
ask your administrator to grant you the
BigQuery Admin ( roles/bigquery.admin )
IAM role.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains the
bigquery.config.update
permission,
which is required to
specify a configuration setting.
You might also be able to get
this permission
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
For more information on IAM roles and permissions in
BigQuery, see
Predefined roles and permissions .
Specify global settings
You can specify global settings at the organization or project level.
Limitations
Global configuration settings are subject to the following limitations:
Global organization and project settings are not available in
BigQuery Omni locations .
When you modify the default_location global setting, it can take up to
10 minutes to propagate. Until the setting is propagated, it is possible for
eligible queries to be routed to the previous default location.
Configure global organization settings
If you don't explicitly specify a location ,
the location is determined in one of the following ways:
The location of the datasets referenced in the request. For example, if a
query references a table or view in a dataset stored in the
asia-northeast1 region, the query job runs in asia-northeast1 .
The region specified for a connection referenced in a request.
The location of a destination table.
If the location isn't explicitly specified, and it can't be determined from the
resources in the request, the default location is used. If default location
isn't set, the job runs in the US multi-region.
You can configure global settings at the organization level by using the
ALTER ORGANIZATION SET OPTIONS DDL statement . The default
location is the only global organization setting. The default location is used
to run jobs when the location can't be inferred from the request.
When you configure the default location, you don't specify a region where the
setting applies. You can't mix global and regional settings in the same DDL
statement.
Note: When you modify the default_location global setting, it can take up to
10 minutes to propagate. Until the setting is propagated, it is possible for
eligible queries to be routed to the previous default location.
To configure the default_location at the organization level, follow these
steps:
Console
Go to the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to BigQuery
Click the query editor. This tab is labeled search_insights
Untitled query .
To configure the default_location , enter the following DDL statement
into the Query editor :
ALTER ORGANIZATION
SET OPTIONS (
`default_location` = ' LOCATION '
);
Replace LOCATION with a region or multi-region
location . This value is the location used to
run jobs when it can't be inferred from the request. For example, the
default location is used if the location of the datasets in a query
can't be determined.
Alternatively, to clear the default_location organization-level global
settings, enter the following DDL statement into the Query editor :
ALTER ORGANIZATION
SET OPTIONS (
`default_location` = NULL
);
Click Run .
bq
To configure the default_location at the organization level, enter the
bq query command
and supply the following DDL statement as the query parameter. Set the
use_legacy_sql flag to false .
ALTER ORGANIZATION
SET OPTIONS (
`default_location` = ' LOCATION '
);
Replace LOCATION with a region or multi-region
location . This value is the location used to run
jobs when it can't be inferred from the request. For example, the default
location is used if the location of the datasets in a query can't be
determined.
To clear the default_location at the organization level,
enter the bq query
command and supply the following DDL statement as the query parameter. Set
the use_legacy_sql flag to false .
ALTER ORGANIZATION
SET OPTIONS (
`default_location` = NULL
);
API
Call the jobs.query method
and supply the DDL statement in the request body's query property.
Configure global project settings
If you don't explicitly specify a location ,
the location is determined in one of the following ways:
The location of the datasets referenced in the request. For example, if a
query references a table or view in a dataset stored in the
asia-northeast1 region, the query job runs in asia-northeast1 .
The region specified for a connection referenced in a request.
The location of a destination table.
If the location isn't explicitly specified, and it can't be determined from the
resources in the request, the default location is used. If default location
isn't set, the job runs in the US multi-region.
You can configure global settings at the project level by using by using the
ALTER PROJECT SET OPTIONS DDL statement .
The ALTER PROJECT SET OPTIONS DDL statement optionally accepts the
PROJECT_ID variable. If the PROJECT_ID is not specified, it defaults to the
current project where you run the ALTER PROJECT DDL statement.
The default location is the only global project setting. When you configure the
default location, you don't specify a region where the setting applies. You
can't mix global and regional settings in the same DDL statement.
Project-level configurations override organization-level configurations.
Project-level configurations can in turn be overridden by
session-level configurations , which can
be overridden by job-level configurations .
To configure the default_location at the project level, follow these steps:
Console
Go to the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to BigQuery
Click the query editor. This tab is labeled search_insights
Untitled query .
To configure the default_location , enter the following DDL statement
into the Query editor :
ALTER PROJECT PROJECT_ID
SET OPTIONS (
`default_location` = ' LOCATION '
);
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID.
LOCATION : a region or multi-region
location . This value is the location
used to run jobs when it can't be inferred from the request. For
example, the default location is used if the location of the
datasets in a query can't be determined.
Alternatively, to clear the default_location setting, enter the
following DDL statement into the Query editor . If you
clear the default_location at the project level, organization-level
default settings are used, if they exist. Otherwise, the system default
setting is used.
ALTER PROJECT PROJECT_ID
SET OPTIONS (
`default_location` = NULL
);
Click Run .
bq
To configure the default_location at the project level, enter the
bq query command
and supply the following DDL statement as the query parameter. Set the
use_legacy_sql flag to false .
ALTER PROJECT PROJECT_ID
SET OPTIONS (
`default_location` = ' LOCATION '
);
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID.
LOCATION : a region or multi-region
location . This value is the location used to
run jobs when it can't be inferred from the request. For example, the
default location is used if the location of the datasets in a query
can't be determined.
Alternatively, to clear the default_location at the project level,
enter the bq query
command and supply the following DDL statement as the query parameter. Set
the use_legacy_sql flag to false . If you clear the default_location at
the project level, organization-level default settings are used, if they
exist. Otherwise, the system default setting is used.
ALTER PROJECT PROJECT_ID
SET OPTIONS (
`default_location` = NULL
);
API
Call the jobs.query method
and supply the DDL statement in the request body's query property.
Specify regional settings
You can configure regional settings at the organization or project level.
Configure regional organization settings
You can configure regional settings at the organization level by using the
ALTER ORGANIZATION SET OPTIONS DDL statement . You must
specify the region where each organization setting applies. You can only use one
region in a statement.
To configure regional organization settings, follow these steps. The following
example specifies several default regional configurations, including the
following:
Time zone: America/Chicago
Cloud KMS key: a user-defined key
Query timeout: 30 minutes (1,800,000 milliseconds)
Interactive query queue timeout: 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds)
Batch query queue timeout: 20 minutes (1,200,000 milliseconds)
INFORMATION_SCHEMA : enabled

and supply the DDL statement in the request body's query property.
Configure regional project settings
You can configure regional settings at the project level by using the
ALTER PROJECT SET OPTIONS DDL statement .
When you specify the configuration, you must specify the region where it
applies. You can only use one region in each statement.
Project-level configurations override organization-level configurations.
Project-level configurations can in turn be overridden by
session-level configurations , which can
be overridden by job-level configurations .
The ALTER PROJECT SET OPTIONS DDL statement optionally accepts the
PROJECT_ID variable. If the PROJECT_ID variable is not specified, it
defaults to the current project where you run the ALTER PROJECT DDL statement.
The following example specifies several regional, project-level settings,
including the following:
Time zone: America/Los_Angeles
Cloud KMS key: an example key
Query timeout: 1 hour (1,800,000 milliseconds)
Interactive query queue timeout: 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds)

Retrieve configuration settings
You can view the configuration settings for an organization or project
by using the following INFORMATION_SCHEMA
views:
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROJECT_OPTIONS :
the configurations applied to a project.
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EFFECTIVE_PROJECT_OPTIONS :
the effective configurations applied to a project. Effective configurations
include all configurations set at the project level as well as all settings
inherited by the project from an organization.
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ORGANIZATION_OPTIONS :
the configurations applied to an organization.
It may take a few minutes for new configurations to become effective and
reflected within the INFORMATION_SCHEMA view.
Required roles
To get the permission that
you need to retrieve configuration settings,
ask your administrator to grant you the
BigQuery Job User ( roles/bigquery.jobUser )
IAM role on the specified project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains the
bigquery.config.get
permission,
which is required to
retrieve configuration settings.
You might also be able to get
this permission
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
For more information on IAM roles and permissions in
BigQuery, see
Predefined roles and permissions .
Examples
Use the following query examples to retrieve your project and organization
settings from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA views.
View global settings
To view all global organization settings, run the following query:
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . ORGANIZATION_OPTIONS ;
To view just the default location organization setting, run the following query:
SELECT
option_value
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . ORGANIZATION_OPTIONS
WHERE option_name = 'default_location'
To view all effective global configurations for your default project, run the
following query:
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . EFFECTIVE_PROJECT_OPTIONS ;
To view just the default location effective global configuration for your
default project, run the following query:
SELECT
option_value
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . EFFECTIVE_PROJECT_OPTIONS
WHERE option_name = 'default_location'
To view all global configurations for your default project, run the
following query:
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . PROJECT_OPTIONS ;
To view just the default location setting for your default project, run the
following query:
SELECT
option_value
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . PROJECT_OPTIONS
WHERE option_name = 'default_location'
View regional settings
To view the configurations under an organization in the us region, run the
following query:
SELECT * FROM region - us . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . ORGANIZATION_OPTIONS ;
To view the effective configurations under your default project in the us
region, run the following query:
SELECT * FROM region - us . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . EFFECTIVE_PROJECT_OPTIONS ;
To view the configurations under your default project in the us region,
run the following query:
SELECT * FROM region - us . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . PROJECT_OPTIONS ;
Configuration settings
The following sections describe the configuration settings that you can specify.
Query and job execution settings
Use the following settings to control how queries are executed, timed, and
queued.
default_batch_query_queue_timeout_ms : The default amount of time, in
milliseconds, that a batch query is
queued . If unset, the default is 24
hours. The minimum value is 1 millisecond. The maximum value is 48 hours.
To turn off batch query queueing, set the value to -1 .
default_interactive_query_queue_timeout_ms : The default amount of time,
in milliseconds, that an interactive query is
queued . If unset, the default
is six hours. The minimum value is 1 millisecond. The maximum value is 48
hours. To turn off interactive query queueing, set the value to -1 .
default_query_job_timeout_ms : The default time after which a query job
times out, including the time the job is queued and the time spent running.
The timeout period must be between 5 minutes and 48 hours. This timeout
only applies to individual query jobs and the child jobs of scripts. To set
a timeout for script jobs, you should use the jobs.insert
API method and set the jobTimeoutMs field.
Note: The default_query_job_timeout_ms setting also applies to
continuous query jobs. To
override this project-level setting for an individual continuous query,
assign a
job timeout
to the continuous query in question. Continuous queries still adhere to
maximum runtimes .
default_location : The default_location configuration setting
is used to run jobs when the location isn't set or can't be determined .
If default_location isn't set, the job runs in the US multi-region.
enable_reservation_based_fairness : The option that determines how idle
slots are shared. The default value is false, which means idle slots are
equally distributed across all query projects. If enabled, the idle slots
are shared equally across all reservations first, and then across projects
within the reservation. For more information, see
reservation-based fairness . This option is
only supported at the project level. You can't specify it at the
organization or job level.
default_time_zone : The default time zone to use in time zone-dependent
GoogleSQL functions, when a time zone is not specified as an
argument. This configuration does not apply to
time-unit column partitioned tables
(which use UTC as the time zone), the
Storage Transfer Service schedule transfers ,
or loading data with the bq command-line tool .
For more information, see
time zones .
Note: If you want to set a default time zone, ensure any existing queries
that use DATETIME literals aren't affected. This includes queries with the
explicit DATETIME keyword, implicitly converted string literals passed as
a parameter to time functions like DATETIME_DIFF('2022-10-01', ...) , the
PARSE_DATETIME() function, and more. For this reason, it is safer to only
set the default_time_zone parameter on new projects.
default_query_optimizer_options : The history-based query optimizations.
This option can be one of the following:
'adaptive=on' : Use history-based query optimizations.
'adaptive=off' : Don't use history-based query optimizations.
NULL (default): Use the default history-based query optimizations
setting, which is equivalent to 'adaptive=on' .
default_sql_dialect_option : The default SQL query dialect for executing
query jobs using the bq command-line tool or BigQuery API. Changing this setting
doesn't affect the default dialect in the console. This option can be one of
the following:
'default_legacy_sql' (default): Use legacy SQL if the query dialect
isn't specified at the job level.
'default_google_sql' : Use GoogleSQL if the query dialect
isn't specified at the job level.
'only_google_sql' : Use GoogleSQL if the query dialect isn't
specified at the job level. Reject jobs with query dialect set to legacy
SQL.
NULL : Use the default query dialect setting, which is equivalent to
'default_legacy_sql' .
enable_global_queries_execution : The option that determines if
global queries can be run. The default
value is FALSE , which means that global queries are not enabled.
enable_global_queries_data_access : The option that determines if
global queries can access data stored in
the region. The default value is FALSE , which means that global queries
can't copy data from this region regardless of the project in which they
run.
Data management settings
Use the following settings to define rules for data creation, security, and
lifecycle.
default_column_name_character_map : The default scope and handling of
characters in column names. If unset, load jobs that use unsupported
characters in column names fail with an error message. Some older
tables might be set to replace unsupported characters in column names.
For more information, see
load_option_list .
default_kms_key_name : The default Cloud Key Management Service key for encrypting table
data, including temporary or anonymous tables. For more information, see
Customer-managed Cloud KMS keys .
Note: to set a default Cloud KMS key, you must grant the
Encrypter/Decrypter role to all BigQuery service accounts that
are used within the project or organization. If a service account within the
project or organization doesn't have appropriate permissions, all queries
run by the service account fail. For information about assigning the
Encrypter/Decrypter role, see
Assign the Encrypter/Decrypter role .
If you set a default Cloud KMS key without first assigning the
appropriate roles, you can clear the default key by setting the value to
NULL . For examples, see
Configure organization settings and
Configure project settings .
default_max_time_travel_hours : The default time travel window in hours for
new datasets. This duration must be within the range of 48 to 168,
inclusive, and must be divisible by 24. Changing the default max time travel
hours does not affect existing datasets. For more information, see
Time Travel and data retention .
enable_info_schema_storage : The option that provides access to
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE
and SEARCH_INDEXES
views and their variants. By default, this option is not enabled. If you
query these views for the first time without setting this option to TRUE ,
the query fails and provides instructions to enable it. After this option is
enabled, queries succeed immediately and return data generated from that
point forward. A complete backfill of historical data can take approximately
one day to become available in the views. If you used these
views before this setting was introduced, this option is already enabled.
Cost and resource settings
Use the following settings to determine how resources are billed and connected.
default_storage_billing_model : The default storage billing model for new
datasets. Set the value to PHYSICAL to use physical bytes when calculating storage
charges or to LOGICAL to use logical bytes.
Note that changing the default storage billing model does not affect existing datasets.
For more information, see Storage billing models .
default_cloud_resource_connection_id : The default connection to use when
creating tables and models. Only specify the connection's ID or name, and
exclude the attached project ID and region prefixes. Using
default connections can cause the permissions granted to the connection's
service account to be updated, depending on the type of table or model you're
creating. For more information, see the Default connection
overview .
