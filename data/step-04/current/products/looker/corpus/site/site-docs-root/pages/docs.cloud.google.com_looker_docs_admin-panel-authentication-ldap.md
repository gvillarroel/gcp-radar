Admin settings - LDAP authentication
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: Looker (Google Cloud core) instances don't include this page.
The LDAP page in the Authentication section of the Admin menu lets you configure Looker to authenticate users with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This page describes that process and includes instructions for linking LDAP groups to Looker roles and permissions.
Requirements
Looker displays the LDAP page in the Authentication section of the Admin menu only if the following conditions are met:
Your Looker instance is not a Looker (Google Cloud core) instance.
You have the Admin role .
Your Looker instance is enabled to use LDAP. Contact your account executive to enable LDAP.
If these conditions are met, and you don't see the LDAP page, open a support request to enable LDAP on your instance.
Considerations
Keep the following considerations in mind while setting up LDAP authentication on your Looker instance:
Looker authentication uses LDAP's "simple" authentication . Anonymous authentication is not supported.
You must create a single LDAP user account that has read privileges to user entries and any group entries that will be used by Looker.
Looker only reads from the LDAP directory (no writes).
Looker can migrate existing accounts to LDAP using email addresses.
Looker API usage does not interact with LDAP authentication.
If your LDAP server restricts IP traffic, you will need to add Looker's IP addresses to your LDAP server's IP allowlist or inbound traffic rules.
LDAP overrides two-factor authentication . If you have previously enabled two-factor authentication, your users will not see the two-factor authentication login screens after you enable LDAP.
Be careful if disabling LDAP authentication
Caution: Disabling LDAP without enabling another authentication method can lock you and other users out of Looker.
If you are logged in to Looker using LDAP and want to disable LDAP authentication, be careful to first do both of the following steps:
Ensure that you have other credentials to sign in.
Enable the Alternate Login option on the LDAP configuration page.
Otherwise, you could lock yourself and other users out of Looker.
Getting started
To configure LDAP for your Looker instance, select LDAP from the Authentication section of the Admin panel. On the LDAP Authentication page, select Configure LDAP .
Set up your connection
Looker supports transport and encryption with LDAP in the clear and LDAP over TLS. LDAP over TLS is strongly recommended. StartTLS and other encryption schemes are not supported.
Enter your Host and Port information.
Select the box next to TLS if you are using LDAP over TLS.
If you are using LDAP over TLS, Looker enforces peer certificate verification by default. If you need to disable peer certificate verification, check No Verify .
Click Test Connection . If any errors are surfaced, correct them before proceeding.
Connection authentication
Looker requires access to an LDAP account that is password-protected. The LDAP account should have read access to people entries and to a new set of role entries. The Looker LDAP account does not require write access (nor access to any other aspects of the directory), and it does not matter what namespace the account is created in.
Enter the Password .
[Optional] Select the Force No Paging checkbox if your LDAP provider does not provide paged results. In some cases, this may help if you are not receiving any matches when searching for users, although it is not the only solution for such a problem.
Click the Test Authentication button. If any errors are surfaced, ensure that your authentication information is correct. If your credentials are valid but errors still persist, contact your company's LDAP administrator.
User binding settings
The details in this section specify how Looker will find users in your directory, bind for authentication, and extract user information.
Set the Base DN , which is the base of the search tree for all users
[Optional] Specify a User Object Class , which controls the types of results that Looker will find and return. This is useful if the Base DN is a mix of object types (people, groups, printers, and so on), and you only want to return entries of one type.
Set the Login Attrs , which defines the attribute(s) your users will use to sign in. These must be unique per user, and something your users are familiar with as their ID within your system. For example, you might choose a user ID or full email address. If you add more than one attribute, Looker will search through both to find the appropriate user. Avoid using formats that could result in duplicate accounts, such as first name and last name.
Specify the Email Attr , First Name Attr , and Last Name Attr . This information tells Looker how to map those fields and extract their information during login.
Set the ID Attr , which indicates a field that Looker uses as the unique ID for users. This will generally be one of the login fields.
Optionally, enter an Optional Custom Filter , which lets you provide arbitrary LDAP filters that will be applied when searching for a user to bind during LDAP authentication. This is useful if you want to filter out sets of user records, such as disabled users or users who are in a different organization.
Example
This example ldiff user entry demonstrates how to set corresponding Looker settings:
Ldiff User Entry
dn: cn=mward,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: person
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: top
cn: mward
userpassword: normal
givenname: Marcus
telephonenumber: +1 408 555 5688
sn: Ward
mail: mward@example.com
ou: People
Corresponding Looker Settings
Base DN: ou=People,dc=looker,dc=com
User Object Class: person
Login Attrs: cn
Email Attr: mail
First Name Attr: givenname
Last Name Attr: sn
ID Attr: cn
Pairing LDAP user attributes with Looker user attributes
You can optionally use the data in your LDAP user attributes to automatically populate values in Looker user attributes when a user logs in. For example, if you have configured LDAP to make user-specific connections to your database, you could pair your LDAP user attributes with Looker user attributes to make your database connections user-specific in Looker.
Note that the LDAP attribute must be a user attribute, not a group attribute.
To pair LDAP user attributes with corresponding Looker user attributes, or manage existing pairings, follow these steps:
In the User Attribute Pairings section, click the Manage Pairings button to open the Manage Pairings side panel.
In the Claim field, enter the name of the LDAP user attribute that you want to pair. Claim names can only be entered in the list once. If you want to associate a claim with multiple Looker attributes, you can enter multiple attributes in the Looker User Attributes field.
In the Looker User Attributes field, a drop-down list of Looker user attributes for the instance appears. Select the name of the Looker user attribute that you want to pair with the LDAP user attribute. Multiple Looker user attributes can be selected. At least one Looker user attribute must be selected.
Select the Required checkbox if you want to require an LDAP attribute value to allow a user to sign in.
Click the Add Pairing button to add another pairing row to the list. Repeat these steps to add more attribute pairs.
At the right of each pairing row is a delete Remove pairing icon. Click this icon to remove an attribute pairing from your instance.
Click the close Close icon to exit the Manage Pairings side panel.
Test your LDAP configuration.
Verify your LDAP configuration, and, at the bottom of the LDAP Authentication page, select the I have verified the LDAP configuration checkbox.
Click the Enable LDAP or Update LDAP Settings button to save your LDAP user attribute pairings.
The Manage Pairings side panel also includes the following tools:
The Filter List filter menu and search bar. Use these tools to search the pairings that have already been added to your instance.
The Display pagination drop-down menu. Use this menu to display 10, 25, 50, or 100 pairings on each page.
Test user information
Enter a test user's credentials and click the Test User Authentication button. Looker will attempt a full LDAP authentication sequence and show the result. Upon success, Looker outputs the user information from the directory plus some trace information about the authentication process which can aid in resolving configuration problems.
Verify that authentication succeeds and that all fields are mapped correctly . For example, confirm that the first_name field doesn't contain a value that belongs to last_name .
Note: You can test any user in your system by entering only the User ID , omitting the User Password , and then clicking Test User Information . This will test the mapping, but won't test authentication.
Groups and roles
You can configure Looker to create groups that mirror your externally managed LDAP groups, and then you can assign Looker roles to users based on their mirrored LDAP groups. When you make changes to your LDAP group membership, those changes are automatically propagated into Looker group configuration.
Mirroring LDAP groups lets you use your externally defined LDAP directory to manage Looker groups and users. This, in turn, lets you manage your group membership for multiple software as a service (SaaS) tools, such as Looker, in one place.
If you turn on Mirror LDAP Groups , then Looker will make one Looker group for every LDAP group that is introduced into the system. Those Looker groups can be viewed on the Groups page of the Admin section of Looker. Groups can be used for assigning roles to group members, setting content access controls , and assigning user attributes .
Default groups and roles
By default, the Mirror LDAP Groups switch is off. In this case, you can set a default group for new LDAP users. In the New User Groups and New User Roles fields, enter the names of any Looker groups or roles to which you want to assign new Looker users when they first sign in to Looker.
These groups and roles are applied to new users at their initial login. The groups and roles are not applied to pre-existing users, and they are not reapplied if they are removed from users after the users' initial login.
If you later enable mirrored LDAP groups, these defaults will be removed for users upon their next login and replaced by roles assigned in the Mirror LDAP Groups section. These default options will no longer be available or assigned, and they will be fully replaced by the mirrored groups configuration.
Enabling mirror LDAP groups
If you choose to mirror your LDAP groups within Looker, turn on the Mirror LDAP Groups switch. Looker displays these settings:
Group Finder Strategy : Choose an option from the drop-down to tell Looker how to find a user's groups:
Groups Have Member Attributes : This is the more common option. When looking for a group member, Looker will only return the groups to which a user is directly assigned. For example, if a user is a member of the Database-Admin group, and the Database-Admin group is a member of the Engineering group, a user would only get the permissions affiliated with the Database-Admin group.
Groups Have Member Attributes (deep search) : This option lets groups be members of other groups, which is sometimes referred to as LDAP nested groups . This means that a user can have the permissions of more than one group. For example, if a user is a member of the Database-Admin group, and the Database-Admin group is a member of the Engineering group, a user would get the permissions affiliated with both of these groups. Some LDAP servers (especially Microsoft Active Directory) have support to automatically execute this type of deep search, even when the caller is doing what seems like a shallow search. That may be another method you can use to execute a deep search.
Base DN : Lets you narrow the search, and can be the same as the Base DN specified in the User Binding Settings section of this documentation page.
Groups Object Class(es) : This setting is optional. As noted in the User Binding Settings section, this allows the results that Looker returns to be constrained to a particular object type or set of types.
Group Member Attr : The attribute that, for each group, determines the objects (in this case, probably the people) that are a member.
Group User Attr : The name of the LDAP user attribute whose value we will search for in the Group entries to determine whether a user is part of the group. This defaults to dn (meaning that leaving it blank is the same as setting it to dn ), which will result in LDAP using the full Distinguished Name, which is the exact case-sensitive string that would exist in the LDAP search itself, to search Group entries.
The Manage Groups button: Click this button to open the Manage Groups side panel, where you can add, remove, or edit a custom group or theroles that are assigned to the group in Looker. The Manage Groups side panel displays the following fields:
The Preferred Group Name field. Enter a custom name for the mirrored group in this field. This is the name that will be displayed on the Groups page of the Admin section of Looker.
A Group DN field. Enter the LDAP group in this field. The Group DN should include the full Distinguished Name, which is the exact case-sensitive string that would exist in the LDAP search itself. LDAP users who are included in the LDAP group will be added to the mirrored group within Looker.
A Role field. In this field, select one or more Looker roles that will be assigned to each user in the group.
A delete Remove Mapping icon. Click this icon to remove a mirrored group from your Looker instance. If you delete a group, that group will no longer be mirrored in Looker and its members will no longer have the roles in Looker assigned to them through that group.
The Manage Groups side panel also includes the following tools:
The Filter List filter menu and search bar. Use these tools to search the groups that have already been added to your instance.
The Add Mapping button. Click this button to add a custom group to the instance.
The Display pagination drop-down menu. Use this menu to select how many groups to display on each page.
Editing mirrored groups
If you edit a mirrored group that was previously configured in this screen, the configuration of the group will change but the group itself will remain intact. For example, you could change the Looker group name of a group, which would change how the group appears in Looker's Groups page but wouldn't change the assigned roles and group members. Changing the LDAP group name would maintain the group name and roles, but members of the group would be reassigned based on the users who are members of the external LDAP group that has the new LDAP group name.
Any edits made to a mirrored group will be applied to users of that group when they next sign in to Looker.
Advanced role management
If you have enabled the Mirror LDAP Groups switch, Looker displays these settings. The options in this section determine how much flexibility Lookeradmins have when configuring Looker groups and users who have been mirrored from Looker.
For example, if you want your Looker group and user configuration to strictly match your LDAP configuration, turn on these options. When all of the first three options are enabled, Looker admins cannot modify membership of mirrored groups and can only assign roles to users through LDAP mirrored groups.
If you want to have more flexibility to further customize your groups within Looker, turn off these options. Your Looker groups will still mirror your LDAP configuration, but you will be able to do additional group and user management within Looker, such as adding LDAP users to Looker groups or assigning Looker roles directly to LDAP users.
For new Looker instances, or Looker instances that have no previously configured mirrored groups, these options are off by default.
For existing Looker instances that have configured mirrored groups, these options are on by default.
Note: Turning on more restrictive settings will cause users to lose group membership or assigned roles that were configured in Looker directly . This occurs the next time those users sign in to Looker.
The Advanced Role Management section contains these options:
Prevent Individual LDAP Users from Receiving Direct Roles : Turning this option on prevents Looker admins from assigning Looker roles directly to LDAP users. LDAP users will receive roles only through their group memberships. If LDAP users are allowed membership in built-in (not mirrored) Looker groups, they can still inherit their roles both from mirrored LDAP groups and from built-in Looker groups. Any LDAP users who were previously assigned roles directly will have those roles removed when they next sign in.
If this option is off, Looker admins can assign Looker roles directly to LDAP users as if they are users who were configured directly in Looker.
Prevent Direct Membership in non-LDAP Groups : Turning this option on prevents Looker admins from adding LDAP users directly to built-in Looker groups. If mirrored LDAP groups are allowed to be members of built-in Looker groups, LDAP users may retain membership in any parent Looker groups. Any LDAP users who were previously assigned to built-in Looker groups will be removed from those groups when they next sign in.
If this option is off, Looker admins can add LDAP users directly to built-in Looker groups.
Prevent Role Inheritance from non-LDAP Groups : Turning this option on prevents members of mirrored LDAP groups from inheriting roles from built-in Looker groups. Any LDAP users who previously inherited roles from a parent Looker group will lose those roles when they next sign in.
If this option is off, mirrored LDAP groups or LDAP users who are added as a member of a built-in Looker group will inherit the roles assigned to the parent Looker group.
Auth Requires Role : If this option is on, LDAP users are required to have a role assigned. Any LDAP users who don't have a role assigned won't be able to sign in to Looker at all.
If this option is off, LDAP users can authenticate to Looker even if they have no role assigned. A user with no assigned role won't be able to see any data or take any action in Looker, but they will be able to sign in to Looker.
Disabling mirror LDAP groups
If you want to stop mirroring your LDAP groups within Looker, turn off the Mirror LDAP Groups switch. Turning off the switch results in the following behavior:
Any mirror LDAP group with no users is deleted immediately.
Any mirror LDAP group that does contain users is marked as orphaned. If no users of this group log in within 31 days, the group is deleted. Users can no longer be added or removed from orphaned LDAP groups.
Migration and integration options
Important: Looker recommends that you enable both of the migration and integration options.
Alternate login for admins and specified users
Allow an alternate email-based login for admins and for users with the login_special_email permission (read more about setting this permission in the Roles documentation ). This option will appear on the Looker login page if you've turned it on and the user has the appropriate permission.
This option is useful as a fallback during LDAP setup, if LDAP config problems occur later, or if you need to support some users who are not in your LDAP directory.
Looker email and password logins are always disabled for regular users when LDAP is enabled.
Note: If a user has authenticated into the Looker instance using only LDAP, you can enable alternate login only by using the Looker API. To learn how to enable alternate login using the Looker API, see the Enabling the alternate login option documentation page.
Merge by email
This option allows Looker to merge first-time LDAP users with their existing Looker accounts, based on email address.
If Looker cannot find a matching email address, a new account will be created for the user.
Troubleshooting
To help troubleshoot authentication issues, check the User Activity dashboard in System Activity . This dashboard has tiles that display recent login failures and includes the authentication method that was used, the error message that was returned, and the time of the attempt.
Save and apply settings
Important: Be sure to thoroughly test your settings before confirming them. It's also a good idea to enable the alternate login option until you have confirmed that these settings work as intended. Otherwise, you could lock yourself and other users out of Looker.
Once you are done entering your information, and the tests are all passing, check I have confirmed the configuration above and want to enable applying it globally and click Update Settings to save.
