Enabling and disabling the Canonical Service controller
Note: Canonical Services are supported automatically
in Cloud Service Mesh version 1.6.8 and higher.
The Canonical Service controller groups workloads belonging to the same logical
service and is required for the full functionality of the Services dashboard
in the Google Cloud console.
All managed Cloud Service Mesh installations and in-cluster installations
with asmcli from version 1.25 provisioned with the managed Canonical Service
controller. The in-cluster Canonical Service Controller has been deprecated and
will no longer receive updates. While existing deployments of in-cluster
controller will continue to operate, we strongly recommend migrating to the
managed Canonical Service Controller to ensure compatibility with future
releases, access to the latest features, and continued support.
To determine if the in-cluster Canonical Service controller is enabled on your
cluster:
kubectl get services -n asm-system
Disable the in-cluster Canonical Service controller
For existing in-cluster controller deployments, you should migrate to the managed
Canonical Service controller. Follow the
migration guide .
Enable the Managed Canonical Service Controller
If you installed managed Cloud Service Mesh, then the Managed Canonical
Service Controller was installed by default. Also, all the in-cluster
Cloud Service Mesh installations with asmcli from version 1.25 will be
provisioned with the managed Canonical Service controller.
Ensure you are running the Managed Canonical Service Controller by running
the following command:
Replace FLEET_PROJECT_ID with the ID of your Fleet Host project. Generally,
the FLEET_PROJECT_ID has the same name as the project.
gcloud beta container hub mesh describe --project FLEET_PROJECT_ID
If the description states that the Canonical Services are reconciled
successfully, then Manged Canonical Service Controller is operating as
expected. No further action is required.
