Cloud Service Mesh by example: canary deployments
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
In this tutorial, you walk through a common use case: rolling out a
canary deployment with Cloud Service Mesh using Istio APIs.
What is a canary deployment?
A canary deployment routes a small percentage of traffic to a new version of a
microservice, then gradually increases that percentage while phasing out and
retiring the old version. If something goes wrong during this process, traffic
can be switched back to the earlier version. With Cloud Service Mesh, you can
route traffic to ensure that new services are introduced safely.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
Cloud Service Mesh
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish this tutorial, you can avoid ongoing costs by deleting the
resources you created. For more information, see Clean up .
Before you begin
Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project. Learn how to
confirm that billing is enabled for your project .
Provision Cloud Service Mesh
on a GKE cluster
or
on another supported Kubernetes cluster .
Deploy an Ingress Gateway .
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-service-mesh-samples
cd anthos-service-mesh-samples/docs/canary-service
Deploy Online Boutique
Set the current context for kubectl to the cluster where you plan to
deploy Online Boutique. The command depends on whether you provisioned
Cloud Service Mesh on a GKE cluster or a Kubernetes
cluster outside GKE:
GKE on Google Cloud
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
GKE outside Google Cloud
kubectl config use-context CLUSTER_NAME
Create the namespace for the sample application and the ingress gateway:
kubectl create namespace onlineboutique
Label the onlineboutique namespace to automatically inject Envoy proxies.
Follow the steps on how to enable automatic sidecar injection .
Deploy the sample app. For this tutorial, you deploy
Online Boutique ,
a microservice demo app.
kubectl apply \
-n onlineboutique \
-f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-service-mesh-samples/main/docs/shared/online-boutique/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
Add a label version=v1 to the productcatalog deployment by running the
following command:
kubectl patch deployments/productcatalogservice -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"version":"v1"}}}}}' \
-n onlineboutique
View the services that you deployed:
kubectl get pods -n onlineboutique

View the VirtualService created.
kubectl get virtualservices -n onlineboutique
Expected outcome:
NAME GATEWAYS HOSTS AGE
productcatalogservice ["productcatalogservice"] 2m
Visit the application in your browser using the external IP address of your
ingress gateway:
kubectl get services -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
This next section tours the Cloud Service Mesh UI and show how you can view
your metrics.
View your services in Google Cloud console
In Google Cloud console, go to the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Enterprise edition Services page.
Go to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Enterprise edition Services
By default, you view your services in the List view.
The Table Overview lets you observe all your services, as well as important metrics at a glance.
In the top right, click Topology .
Here you can view your services and their interaction with each other.
You can expand Services and view the Requests per second for each of your services by hovering over on them with your cursor.
Navigate back to the Table View .
In the Services Table , select productcatalogservice . This takes you
to an overview of your service.
On the left side of the screen, click Traffic .
Ensure 100% of the incoming traffic to productcatalogservice goes to the workload service.
The next section goes through creating a v2 of the productcatalog service.
Deploy v2 of a service
For this tutorial, productcatalogservice-v2 introduces a 3-second
latency into requests with the EXTRA_LATENCY field. This simulates a
regression in the new version of the service.

Apply this resource to the onlineboutique namespace.
kubectl apply -f productcatalog-v2.yaml -n onlineboutique
Check on your application pods.
kubectl get pods -n onlineboutique
Expected output:

shippingservice-5488d5b6cb-dj5gd 2/2 Running 0 25h
Note that there are now two productcatalogservices listed.
Use DestinationRule to specify the subsets of a service. In this scenario, there is a subset for v1 and then a separate subset for v2 of productcatalogservice .
apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind : DestinationRule
metadata :
name : productcatalogservice
spec :
host : productcatalogservice
subsets :
- labels :
version : v1
name : v1
- labels :
version : v2
name : v2
Note the labels field. The versions of productcatalogservice are distinguished after the traffic is routed by the VirtualService .
Apply the DestinationRule :
kubectl apply -f destination-v1-v2.yaml -n onlineboutique
Split traffic between v1 and v2
Use VirtualService to define a small percentage of the traffic to direct to v2 of the productcatalogservice .
apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind : VirtualService
metadata :
name : productcatalogservice
spec :
hosts :
- productcatalogservice
http :
- route :
- destination :
host : productcatalogservice
subset : v1
weight : 75
- destination :
host : productcatalogservice
subset : v2
weight : 25
The subset field indicates the version, and the weight field indicates the percentage split of traffic. 75% of traffic goes to v1 of productcatalog, and 25% goes to v2.
Apply the VirtualService :
kubectl apply -f vs-split-traffic.yaml -n onlineboutique
If you visit the EXTERNAL_IP of the cluster's ingress, you should notice that periodically, the frontend is slower to load.
In the next section, explore the traffic split in Google Cloud console.
Observe the traffic split in Google Cloud console
Return to Google Cloud console and go to the GKE Enterprise Services page.
Go to GKE Enterprise Services
In the top right, click Topology .
Expand the productcatalogservice workload and note the productcatalogservice and productcatalogservice-v2 deployments.
Return to the Table View .
Click productcatalogservice in the Services Table.
Return to Traffic on the left navigation bar.
Note that the incoming traffic is split between v1 and v2 by the percentage specified in the VirtualService file, and that there are 2 workloads of the productcatalog service.
On the right side of the page, you see Requests , Error Rate , and Latency Metrics .
With Cloud Service Mesh, each service has these metrics outlined to provide you with observability metrics.
Note: It may take some time for the actual 75-25 split to be shown, since traffic over time is redirected to the v2 service.
Roll out or roll back to a version
After observing the metrics during a canary deployment, you can complete the
roll out the new service version, or roll back to the original service version
by leveraging the VirtualService resource.
Roll out
After you are satisfied with the behavior of a v2 service, you can incrementally
increase the percentage of traffic directed to the v2 service. Eventually,
traffic can be 100% directed to the new service in the VirtualService resource
you created above by removing the traffic split from that resource.
apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind : VirtualService
metadata :
name : productcatalogservice
spec :
hosts :
- productcatalogservice
http :
- route :
- destination :
host : productcatalogservice
subset : v2
To direct all the traffic to v2 of productcatalogservice :
kubectl apply -f vs-v2.yaml -n onlineboutique
Roll back
If you need to roll back to the v1 service, apply the destination-vs-v1.yaml from earlier. This directs traffic only to v1 of productcatalogservice .
apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind : VirtualService
metadata :
name : productcatalogservice
spec :
hosts :
- productcatalogservice
http :
- route :
- destination :
host : productcatalogservice
subset : v1
To direct all the traffic to v1 of productcatalogservice :
kubectl apply -f vs-v1.yaml -n onlineboutique
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
To avoid incurring continuing charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used in this tutorial, you can either delete the project or delete
the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution: Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project
for this tutorial, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost. When you created this project, you might
have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future.
To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com URL,
delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole
project.
In Cloud Shell, delete the project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete the resources
If you want to prevent additional charges, delete the cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
If you registered your cluster with fleet using gcloud container fleet memberships
(rather than --enable-fleet or --fleet-project during cluster creation)
then remove the stale membership:
gcloud container fleet memberships delete MEMBERSHIP \
--project= PROJECT_ID
If you want to keep your cluster configured for Cloud Service Mesh but remove
the Online Boutique sample:
Delete the application namespaces:
kubectl delete -f namespace onlineboutique
Expected output:
namespace "onlineboutique" deleted
Delete the service entries:
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/main/istio-manifests/frontend.yaml -n onlineboutique
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/main/istio-manifests/frontend-gateway.yaml -n onlineboutique
Expected output:
serviceentry.networking.istio.io "allow-egress-googleapis" deleted
serviceentry.networking.istio.io "allow-egress-google-metadata" deleted
