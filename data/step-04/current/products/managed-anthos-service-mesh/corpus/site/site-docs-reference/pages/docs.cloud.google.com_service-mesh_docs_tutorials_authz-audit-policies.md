Configuring audit policies for your services
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
Preview
— Audit policy
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This tutorial only supports the in-cluster
control plane implementation .
An audit policy lets you audit data access to your services in
Cloud Service Mesh. Auditing your services helps you answer the questions
"who did what, when, and possibly why." With an audit policy, you can specify
when an audit log is created and the content of the logs. This guide explains
how to install Cloud Service Mesh so that you can use an audit policy.
Because you view the audit logs in the
Cloud Logging Logs Explorer in the Google Cloud console, audit
policies are supported only on the following platforms:
GKE on Google Cloud
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for bare metal
An audit policy extends
AuthorizationPolicy
by adding an AUDIT action. It takes effect only in its target policy scope
(which can be a workload, a namespace, or the entire mesh). The policies are
ORed together, that is, a request is logged if any policy says so. If no audit
policy applies to a given workload, no audit log is generated for that workload.
Here is an example audit policy to audit all WRITE access to the
/user/profile/* path in myapi :
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
namespace: ns1
name: anyname
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: myapi
action: AUDIT
rules:
- to:
- operation:
methods: ["POST", "UPDATE", "DELETE"]
paths: ["/user/profile/*"]
Limitations
There is no audit log on the ingress-gateway.
The audit content isn't configurable.
Currently, the Cloud Service Mesh audit logs have the same reliability
property as normal access logs. For example, if a workload Pod is restarted,
some audit logs for the workload, if not persisted, can be lost.
Before you begin
Follow the steps in Install dependent tools and validate cluster
to:
Install required tools
Download asmcli
Grant cluster admin permissions
Validate your project and cluster
Prepare gateway configuration
Cloud Service Mesh gives you the option to deploy and manage gateways as part of your
service mesh. A gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the
mesh receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. Gateways are Envoy
proxies that provide you with fine-grained control over traffic entering and
leaving the mesh.
asmcli doesn't install the istio-ingressgateway . We recommend that you
deploy and manage the control plane and gateways separately. For more
information, see Installing and upgrading gateways .
Customizing the Cloud Service Mesh installation
To use an audit policy, customize the Cloud Service Mesh installation:
Installs
Follow the steps in
Install Cloud Service Mesh .
When you run asmcli install , include the following option:
--option audit-authorizationpolicy
For example:
./asmcli install \
--project_id PROJECT_ID \
--cluster_name CLUSTER_NAME \
--cluster_location CLUSTER_LOCATION \
--ca mesh_ca \
--output_dir DIR_PATH \
--enable_all \
--option audit-authorizationpolicy
Be sure to specify any other overlay files that you need to
configure Cloud Service Mesh.
Complete the Cloud Service Mesh installation to enable automatic
sidecar proxy injection on your workloads. See
Deploy and redeploy workloads .
Upgrades
Follow the steps in
Upgrade Cloud Service Mesh .
When you run asmcli install , include the following option:
--option audit-authorizationpolicy
For example:
./asmcli install \
--project_id PROJECT_ID \
--cluster_name CLUSTER_NAME \
--cluster_location CLUSTER_LOCATION \
--ca mesh_ca \
--output_dir DIR_PATH \
--enable_all \
--option audit-authorizationpolicy
Be sure to specify any other overlay files that you need to
configure Cloud Service Mesh.
Complete the Cloud Service Mesh installation to enable automatic
sidecar proxy injection on your workloads. For details see

Using audit logging
This section uses the Bookinfo sample to demonstrate how to use audit logging.
Deploy the
Bookinfo sample application to the
default namespace.
Get the external IP address of the ingress gateway, and
send requests
to the sample application to generate some traffic.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the navigation menu
menu and
select Logging > Logs Explorer :
Go to the Logs Explorer
Select a Google Cloud project.
Because you haven't deployed an audit policy yet, there won't be any audit
logs. Note that the audit log is different from the access log. To
see stackdriver access logs, enter the following query in the Query
builder field, and click Run query :
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/server-accesslog-stackdriver"
For more information on using Logs Explorer, see
Logs Explorer overview .
Configuring the audit policy and checking audit logs
This section provides several options for auditing the Bookinfo application.
After you deploy the audit policy, you can send some requests and then check the
audit log in the Logs Explorer.
Enter the following command to get
authentication credentials
to interact with the cluster. This command also sets the current context for
kubectl to the cluster.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
Note: For regional cluster replace --region with --zone .
Apply the following audit policy to audit GET requests to the
/productpage path:
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "AuthorizationPolicy"
metadata:
name: "audit-productpage"
namespace: default
spec:
action: AUDIT
rules:
- to:
- operation:
methods: ["GET"]
paths: ["/productpage"]
EOF
Send some requests to Bookinfo.
In Logs Explorer, enter the following query in the Query builder field,
and click Run query :
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/server-istio-audit-log"
The query returns logs similar to the following:
Apply the following policy to audit requests to the bookinfo-ratings
service. The audit policies are additive. After applying the following
policy, you see audit logs for requests to both ProductPage and Ratings.
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "AuthorizationPolicy"
metadata:
name: "audit-ratings"
namespace: default
spec:
action: AUDIT
rules:
- from:
- source:
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-ratings"]
to:
- operation:
methods: ["GET"]
EOF
The new audit policy has to propagate first before it takes effect.
Send 10 or more requests to Bookinfo to make sure you hit the ratings
service, and then check the audit log in Logs Explorer. The audit log looks
similar to the following:
Apply the following policy to audit to all services in the default
namespace.
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
namespace: default
name: "audit-all"
spec:
action: AUDIT
rules:
- {}
EOF
Send some more requests to Bookinfo, and then check the audit log in
Logs Explorer. The audit log now logs all requests:
If you want to restrict the audit policy back down to ProductPage and
Ratings, you can delete the audit-all policy:
kubectl delete authorizationpolicy audit-all -n default
Troubleshooting
If you don't see any audit logs after enabling an audit policy, here are a few
things you can check:
Make sure there is traffic for the time period specified in Logs Explorer.
If you are testing with Bookinfo, you can send requests by running the
following command several times:
curl -s http:// EXTERNAL_IP /productpage | grep Bookstore
Check if there is an AuthorizationPolicy on the ingress gateway that
blocks requests to the audited service.
Check the stackdriver access logs with the following filter in the Logs
Explorer to verify if your requests have reached the application:
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/server-accesslog-stackdriver"
To make sure Stackdriver is configured and audit log is enabled,
dump the configuration of current the istiod state.
In the config_dump search for enable_audit_log and your audit policy's
name.
istioctl dashboard envoy POD_NAME . NAMESPACE
To make sure your requests are matched with audit policy rules, you can
check role-based access control (RBAC) debug logs.
Turn on RBAC debug logging with the following command:
kubectl exec POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE -c istio-proxy -- pilot-agent request POST 'logging?rbac=debug'
Send some requests, and then check logs for the Pod with the
kubectl logs command:
kubectl logs POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE -c istio-proxy
