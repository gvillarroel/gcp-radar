Under Authorized JavaScript origins ,
specify the HTTP origins that are allowed to host and query your agent.
For example, https://your-company.com .
Provide end-users with permission to query your agent .
Add each of your end-users or a
group
as a principal with the Dialogflow API Client
and Service Usage Consumer
roles.
Note: The first time an end-user uses the authenticated integration,
they are asked to select which scopes to allow.
They must allow the Cloud API.
Embed
Paste the embed code you copied above in a webpage on your website.
The <script> and <df-messenger> HTML elements
should be in the <body> element of your page.
If you are using an authenticated integration,
set the oauth-client-id attribute for <df-messenger>
to your Oauth client id. And if you want to use end-users' identities for tool
authentication ,
set the access-token-name attribute with any name you like.
Then use Bearer Token with value $session.params. ACCESS_TOKEN_NAME
for tool authentication.
Update any other attributes that require updating.
To allow for responsive layouts,
also add the following to your <head> element:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
Customization
There are many
HTML customizations
and
CSS customizations
that you can apply to affect the appearance and behavior of the chat dialog.
JavaScript
There are many
Javascript events
and
Javascript functions
that you can use to interact with the chat dialog.
Example
The following example shows
HTML customization,
CSS customization,
and JavaScript event handling:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" />
<meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache" />
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0" />
<title>My chat</title>
<style>
df-messenger {
/*
* Customize as required. df-messenger will fill the
* space that is provided.
*/
position: absolute;
right: 0;
top: 0;
bottom: 0;
width: 320px;
}
</style>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/dialogflow-console/fast/df-messenger/prod/v1/df-messenger.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<df-messenger
location="global" <!-- TODO: update agent location as needed -->
project-id="my-project-id" <!-- TODO: update project ID -->
agent-id="my-agent-id" <!-- TODO: update agent ID -->
language-code="en" <!-- TODO: update agent language as needed -->
>
<df-messenger-chat
chat-title="Agent Name" <!-- TODO: update dialog title as needed -->
></df-messenger-chat>
</df-messenger>
<script>
// An example of handling events: Navigate to the first suggested URL.
document.addEventListener('df-url-suggested', (event) => {
if (Array.isArray(event.detail.suggestedUrls) &&
event.detail.suggestedUrls.length) {
window.location.href = event.detail.suggestedUrls[0];
}
});
</script>
</body>
</html>
Fulfillment
There are many
fulfillment response types
that you can use for agent responses.
Answer Feedback
If answer feedback is enabled, by default the chat dialog will add thumbs up thumb_up
and thumbs down thumb_down
buttons to the user interface.
During the conversation,
an end-user can click these buttons to provide feedback on the agent responses.
If the user selects thumbs down,
they can optionally provide a reason for the negative feedback.
Custom Feedback component
To specify a custom feedback element, a new custom element has to be defined on the website.
To submit the feedback, the element must emit a df-custom-submit-feedback-clicked event. The contained detail field must be a string.
class CustomFeedbackElement extends HTMLElement {
constructor () {
super ();
// It is not strictly required but recommended to contain the custom
// element in a shadow root.
this . renderRoot = this . attachShadow ({ mode : 'open' });
}
// Web component Lifecycle method.
connectedCallback () {
const wrapper = document . createElement ( 'div' );
// Build the component as required.
const button = document . createElement ( 'button' );
button . innerText = 'Submit' ;
button . addEventListener ( 'click' , () = > {
this . _onSubmitClick ();
});
wrapper . appendChild ( button );
this . renderRoot . appendChild ( wrapper );
}
// Called when Submit button is clicked.
_onSubmitClick () {
const event = new CustomEvent ( "df-custom-submit-feedback-clicked" , {
// `detail` may be any string,
// this will be sent to the backend to be stored.
detail : JSON . stringify ({
"usefulness" : 2 ,
"accuracy" : 3 ,
}),
// Required to propagate up the DOM tree
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/bubbles
bubbles : true ,
// Required to propagate across ShadowDOM
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/composed
composed : true ,
});
this . dispatchEvent ( event );
}
}
( function () {
// Registers the element. This name must be "df-external-custom-feedback".
customElements . define ( 'df-external-custom-feedback' , CustomFeedbackElement );
})();
Debugging
To test your agent with Dialogflow CX Messenger locally:
Embed the Dialogflow CX Messenger element in a page as described above.
Start a local HTTP server for that page with a specific port.
Access that page at http://localhost:port_number .
