Advanced speech settings
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: Advanced speech settings are only supported by
telephony integrations .
This guide provides additional, advanced settings for speech features. You can
toggle these advanced settings off and on by navigating to Agent settings >
Speech and IVR > Speech-to-Text > Advanced speech settings .
These settings are available in agent settings (applies to entire agent),
flow settings (applies to entire
flow and overrides agent settings),
page settings (applies to page and
overrides flow and agent settings), and
fulfillment settings
(applies to fulfillment and overrides page, flow, and agent settings). A subset
of these settings are available at each level, depending on the setting
relevance for the level. *Before you can configure these settings at any lower
level, you must first check the Enable advanced speech settings box at the
agent level (Agent settings > Speech and IVR > Speech-to-Text > Advanced speech
settings)*.
Updated agent-level settings don't propagate to the flow, page, and fulfillment
level when the Customize option is selected on these lower levels. If the
Customize option emcompasses multiple settings and you want to update only
some of them, you might also need to update other settings if you want them to
be the same as the agent-level settings.

Model selection (Speech-to-Text)
Can be set at the agent, flow, and page levels.
Sets the speech model used for speech recognition. This setting is
language-specific, so you can select different models for different languages.
You can also check Override request-level speech model , which will cause the
selected model to be used even if a runtime API call specifies a different
model.
For Dialogflow CX Phone Gateway, see
limitations .
For more information, see
Speech models .
End of speech sensitivity
Can be set at the agent, flow, and page levels.
Controls the sensitivity for recognizing the end of speech in end-user audio
input. The value ranges from 0 (low sensitivity, less likely to end speech) to
100 (high sensitivity, more likely to end speech).
Note: This setting only supports the phone_call speech model for the en-US
language tag unless you check the
Enable advanced timeout-based end of speech sensitivity setting.
Advanced timeout-based end of speech sensitivity
Can be set at the agent level and disabled at the flow and page levels.
If this setting is enabled, the
End of speech sensitivity
setting value is used as a gauge to establish a relative audio silence time-out
to determine the end of speech. If this setting is disabled (the default), the
End of speech sensitivity setting value is used to determine the end of
speech by the ML model provided by Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
While the End of speech sensitivity setting supports only the phone_call
speech model for the en-US language
tag by default, the Enable advanced timeout-based end of speech sensitivity
setting allows for configuring end of speech sensitivity for all languages and
speech models supported by Dialogflow.
Enable smart endpointing
Can be set at the agent level only.
If this setting is enabled, Dialogflow CX will analyze partial user input to
determine the end of speech. For example, if the user says "I would like to" and
pauses, Dialogflow CX will wait for the user to continue the sentence.
This is particularly useful for numeric parameter collection, where the user
might say "1234" and pause before saying "5678". In order to apply this setting
for a specific parameter, you have to set up
Smart endpointing in
the parameter's form.
This setting is available for the en-US language tag only and is disabled by
default.
No speech timeout
Can be set at the agent, flow, and page levels.
The time duration in seconds for which Dialogflow CX will stop waiting for end-user
audio input. The default is 5 seconds, and the maximum value is 60 seconds. For
this timeout, Dialogflow CX invokes a no-input event .
Barge-in
Can be set at the agent, flow, and fulfillment levels.
When enabled, an end-user can interrupt Dialogflow CX response audio. When
interrupted, Dialogflow CX will stop sending audio, and it will process the next
end-user input.
If there are multiple messages in the message queue ,
and a message was queued by a fulfillment associated with a page, flow, or agent
that has barge-in enabled, then all following messages in the queue will also
have barge-in enabled. In this case, the integration will stop playing audio for
all of the queued messages with barge-in enabled.
Note: Enabling barge-in increases the total billable duration for each turn.
Because the agent is actively listening for an interruption while it's speaking,
you're billed for both Input Seconds and Output Seconds simultaneously
during the response playback, even if the user remains silent.
Allow cancellation of partial response playback
Can be set at the fulfillment level only.
You can enable this setting when the Enable advanced speech settings box is
checked in Agent settings > Speech and IVR and
partial response
is enabled at the fulfillment level. This setting allows cancellation of a
partial response playback.
If a message in the message queue
is created by a fulfillment that allows cancellation, playback of the message is
cancelled if another message is added to the queue. This is useful when you want
an initial message to start playback, but for that playback to be cancelled if a
working webhook produces another message before playback of the initial message
completes.
Audio export bucket
Can be set at the agent and flow levels.
If supplied, any audio data associated with a request will be saved to the
Cloud Storage bucket:
Audio Saved
Applicable requests
End-user audio input
DetectIntent, StreamingDetectIntent, AnalyzeContent, StreamingAnalyzeContent
Text-to-Speech (TTS) audio synthesized for a response
AnalyzeContent, StreamingAnalyzeContent
Grant the Storage Object Creator role to the following service accounts in your project:
To the service account of the format
one-click@df-cx- ALPHANUMERIC_VALUE - ALPHANUMERIC_VALUE .iam.gserviceaccount.com
if you use a partner built-in telephony integration .
To the service account of the format
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com
if you use the Dialogflow CX Phone Gateway
integration. To find this service account in IAM, check the Include
Google-provided role grants option.
