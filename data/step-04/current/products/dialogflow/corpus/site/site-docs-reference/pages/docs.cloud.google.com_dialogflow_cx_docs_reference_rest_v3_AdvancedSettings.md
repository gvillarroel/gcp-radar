Hierarchical advanced settings for agent/flow/page/fulfillment/parameter. Settings exposed at lower level overrides the settings exposed at higher level. Overriding occurs at the sub-setting level. For example, the playbackInterruptionSettings at fulfillment level only overrides the playbackInterruptionSettings at the agent level, leaving other settings at the agent level unchanged.
DTMF settings does not override each other. DTMF settings set at different levels define DTMF detections running in parallel.
Hierarchy: Agent->Flow->Page->Fulfillment/Parameter.
JSON representation
{
"audioExportGcsDestination" : {
object ( GcsDestination )
} ,
"speechSettings" : {
object ( SpeechSettings )
} ,
"dtmfSettings" : {
object ( DtmfSettings )
} ,
"loggingSettings" : {
object ( LoggingSettings )
}
}
Fields
audioExportGcsDestination
object ( GcsDestination )
If present, incoming audio is exported by Dialogflow to the configured Google Cloud Storage destination. Exposed at the following levels: - Agent level - Flow level
speechSettings
object ( SpeechSettings )
Settings for speech to text detection. Exposed at the following levels: - Agent level - Flow level - Page level - Parameter level
dtmfSettings
object ( DtmfSettings )
Settings for DTMF. Exposed at the following levels: - Agent level - Flow level - Page level - Parameter level.
loggingSettings
object ( LoggingSettings )
Settings for logging. Settings for Dialogflow History, Contact Center messages, StackDriver logs, and speech logging. Exposed at the following levels: - Agent level.
GcsDestination
Google Cloud Storage location for a Dialogflow operation that writes or exports objects (e.g. exported agent or transcripts) outside of Dialogflow.
JSON representation
{
"uri" : string
}
Fields
uri
string
Required. The Google Cloud Storage URI for the exported objects. A URI is of the form: gs://bucket/object-name-or-prefix Whether a full object name, or just a prefix, its usage depends on the Dialogflow operation.
SpeechSettings
Define behaviors of speech to text detection.
JSON representation
{
"endpointerSensitivity" : integer ,
"noSpeechTimeout" : string ,
"useTimeoutBasedEndpointing" : boolean ,
"models" : {
string : string ,
...
}
}
Fields
endpointerSensitivity
integer
Sensitivity of the speech model that detects the end of speech. Scale from 0 to 100.
noSpeechTimeout
string ( Duration format)
Timeout before detecting no speech.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with ' s '. Example: "3.5s" .
useTimeoutBasedEndpointing
boolean
Use timeout based endpointing, interpreting endpointer sensitivity as seconds of timeout value.
models
map (key: string, value: string)
Mapping from language to Speech-to-Text model. The mapped Speech-to-Text model will be selected for requests from its corresponding language. For more information, see Speech models .
An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" } .
DtmfSettings
Define behaviors for DTMF (dual tone multi frequency).
JSON representation
{
"enabled" : boolean ,
"maxDigits" : integer ,
"finishDigit" : string ,
"interdigitTimeoutDuration" : string ,
"endpointingTimeoutDuration" : string
}
Fields
enabled
boolean
If true, incoming audio is processed for DTMF (dual tone multi frequency) events. For example, if the caller presses a button on their telephone keypad and DTMF processing is enabled, Dialogflow will detect the event (e.g. a "3" was pressed) in the incoming audio and pass the event to the bot to drive business logic (e.g. when 3 is pressed, return the account balance).
maxDigits
integer
Max length of DTMF digits.
finishDigit
string
The digit that terminates a DTMF digit sequence.
interdigitTimeoutDuration
string ( Duration format)
Interdigit timeout setting for matching dtmf input to regex.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with ' s '. Example: "3.5s" .
endpointingTimeoutDuration
string ( Duration format)
Endpoint timeout setting for matching dtmf input to regex.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with ' s '. Example: "3.5s" .
LoggingSettings
Define behaviors on logging.
JSON representation
{
"enableStackdriverLogging" : boolean ,
"enableInteractionLogging" : boolean ,
"enableConsentBasedRedaction" : boolean
}
Fields
enableStackdriverLogging
boolean
Enables Google Cloud Logging.
enableInteractionLogging
boolean
Enables DF Interaction logging.
enableConsentBasedRedaction
boolean
Enables consent-based end-user input redaction, if true, a pre-defined session parameter $session.params.conversation-redaction will be used to determine if the utterance should be redacted.
