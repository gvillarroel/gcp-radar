Service use best practices
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide provides best practices for using the Dialogflow service.
These guidelines are designed for greater efficiency and accuracy
as well as optimal response times from the service.
You should also see the
general agent design
guide for all agent types,
and the
voice agent design
guide specifically for designing voice agents.
Productionization
Before running your agent in production,
be sure to implement the following best practices:
Use agent versions
Reuse session clients
Implement error handling with retries
Agent versions
You should always use agent versions for your production traffic.
See
Versions and environments
for details.
Create agent backup
Keep an up-to-date
exported
agent backup. This will allow you to quickly recover if you or your team members
accidentally delete the agent or the project.
Client reuse
You can improve the performance of your application
by reusing *Client client library instances
for the duration of your application's execution lifetime.
Most importantly,
you can improve the performance of detect intent API calls
by reusing a SessionsClient client library instance.
Go to the Session API reference
Select a protocol and version for the Session reference:

API error retries
When calling API methods, you may receive error responses.
There are some errors which should be retried,
because they are often due to transient issues.
There are two types of errors:
Cloud API errors .
Errors sent from your
webhook service .
In addition, you should implement an
exponential backoff
for retries.
This allows your system to find an acceptable rate
while the API service is under heavy load.
Cloud API errors
If you are using a Google supplied
client library ,
Cloud API error retries with exponential backoff are implemented for you.
If you have implemented your own client library using REST or gRPC,
you must implement retries for your client.
For information on the errors that you should or should not retry, see
API Improvement Proposals: Automatic retry configuration .
Webhook errors
If your API call triggers a webhook call,
your webhook may return an error.
Even if you are using a Google supplied client library,
webhook errors will not be retried automatically.
Your code should retry 503 Service Unavailable
errors received from your webhook.
See the
webhook service
documentation for information on the types of webhook errors
and how to check for them.
Load testing
It is a best practice to execute load testing for your system
before you release code to production.
Consider these points before implementing your load tests:
Summary
Details
Ramp up load.
Your load test must ramp up the load applied to the Dialogflow service. The service is not designed to handle abrupt bursts of load, which are rarely experienced with real traffic. It takes time for the service to adjust to load demands, so ramp up the request rate slowly, until your test achieves the desired load.
API calls are charged.
You will be charged for API calls during a test, and the calls will be limited by project quota.
Use test doubles.
You may not need to call the API during your load test. If the purpose of your load test is to determine how your system handles load, it is often best to use a test double in place of actual calls to the API. Your test double can simulate the behavior of the API under load.
Use retries.
Your load test must perform retries with a backoff.
Calling Dialogflow securely from an end-user device
You should never store your private keys
used to access the Dialogflow API on an end-user device.
This applies to storing keys on the device directly
and to hard coding keys in applications.
When your client application needs to call the Dialogflow API,
it should send requests to a developer-owned proxy service on a secure platform.
The proxy service can make the actual, authenticated Dialogflow calls.
For example, you should not create a mobile application
that calls Dialogflow directly.
Doing so would require you to store private keys on an end-user device.
Your mobile application should instead
pass requests through a secure proxy service.
Note: Some Dialogflow integrations, like Dialogflow Messenger,
provide both client code and a proxy service, similar to the description above.
The proxy service only responds to requests when the integration is enabled.
To improve utility of these integrations,
the proxy service may not require authentication.
The proxy service API is limited to a small subset
of Dialogflow API methods that are required for the integration.
In addition,
the proxy service never provides Google Cloud or Dialogflow administrative API access
without requiring authentication.
This limited proxy API reduces the vulnerability for abuse.
Performance
This section outlines performance information for various operations
within Dialogflow. Understanding latency is important for designing
responsive agents and setting realistic performance expectations, although these
values are not part of the Dialogflow SLA.
When building monitoring and alerting tools, note that Large Language Models
(LLMs) and speech processing are typically handled using streaming methods.
Responses are sent to the client as soon as possible, often much earlier than
the total duration of the method call. For more information, see the
Best practices with large language models (LLMs) .
Performance per operation
The following table provides information about the typical performance of
Dialogflow operations:
Action
Notes
Flow actions: state handlers
Fastest operation
Flows: intent detection (text)
Fastest operation
Flows: parameter detection (text)
Fast operation
Speech recognition (streaming)
Data is processed and responses are returned as soon as possible. The total execution time is primarily determined by the length of the input audio. Measuring latency using the total execution time is not recommended.
Speech synthesis (streaming)
The total execution time is primarily determined by the length of the output audio. Data is processed and responses are returned as quickly as possible.
Data stores: generative AI disabled
Actual time depends on the size of the data store.
Data stores: generative AI enabled
Performance depends on the size of the data store, the language model in use, and the length of the prompt output and input, in that order.
Generative fallback
Performance depends on the language in use and the prompt output and input length, in that order.
Generators
Performance depends on the language model in use, the complexity of the prompt input and output length, and the number of generators in the turn. Multiple generators in a single turn result in multiple calls to a language model.
Playbooks execution
Performance depends on the complexity of the playbook, the number of prompts, and the execution time of any tools called. The length of the prompt output and input impacts this performance. Multiple language model prompts may be executed serially, adding up to the total call time.
Playbooks: tools
Performance depends on the underlying execution of the tool.
Webhook calls
Performance is directly determined by the execution time of your code in the webhook.
Import / Export agent
Performance depends on the size of the agent.
Agent training
Performance depends on the number of flows, intents, and training phrases. Training large agents can take tens of minutes.
Environment creation
Creating an environment involves training the agent, so the total time will depend on the size and complexity of the agent.
Key Notes:
Streaming: For streaming calls (speech recognition and synthesis), data
is processed as it arrives, and responses are returned as soon as possible.
This means the initial response is typically much faster than the total time of
the call.
Playbooks: An LLM prompt is constructed based on the playbook
instructions, the conversation context and the tool input. Multiple LLM prompts
can be executed in a single playbook call. This is why the playbook execution
is variable, depending on the amount of prompts issued and the complexity of
the calls.
Important Latency Considerations
No Latency Guarantees: Dialogflow SLAs do not consider
latency, even under Provisioned Throughput.
LLM Latency: Be aware that LLM processing can introduce significant
latency. Factor this into your agent design and user expectations.
Monitoring and Alerting: When setting up monitoring and alerting,
account for the streamed nature of responses from LLMs and speech services.
Don't assume full response time is equal to time to first response.
