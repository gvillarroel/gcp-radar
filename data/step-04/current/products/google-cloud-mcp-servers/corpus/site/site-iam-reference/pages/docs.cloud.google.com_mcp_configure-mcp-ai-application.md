Required roles
To get the permission that
you need to make tool calls to Google and Google Cloud MCP tools,
ask your administrator to grant you the
MCP Tool User ( roles/mcp.toolUser )
IAM role on the Google Cloud project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains the
mcp.tools.call
permission,
which is required to
make tool calls to Google and Google Cloud MCP tools.
You might also be able to get
this permission
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Enable the product or service
You can use MCP to connect to supported products when the
product API is enabled in your Google Cloud project.
To connect to a supported product through MCP, enable the product API:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role
( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission.
Learn how to grant roles .
gcloud services enable SERVICE_NAME
Replace SERVICE_NAME with the service name of the product you want to
use through MCP. For example The BigQuery service name is
bigquery.googleapis.com .
Configure an MCP client to use the remote MCP server
AI applications and agents, such as Claude or Gemini CLI, can
instantiate an MCP client that connects to a single MCP server. An AI
application can have multiple clients that connect to different MCP servers. To
connect to a remote MCP server, the MCP client must know at a minimum the URL of
the remote MCP server.
Use toolsets
Agents can be overloaded by too many tools. To decrease the number of tools
available to your agent, you can use toolsets . Toolsets contain a subset of
tools from an MCP server, and have their own unique endpoint. Your agent treats
a toolset as an MCP server.
For example, a single MCP server might have 60 or more tools. If you use a
toolset for the same MCP server with 15 tools, then you can use the MCP server
without overloading your agent.
To configure a toolset, use the toolset endpoint in your MCP configuration
instead of the MCP server endpoint.
General guidance for all MCP clients
In your AI application, look for a way to connect to a remote MCP server. You
are prompted to enter details about the server, such as its name and URL.
For the Google Cloud MCP servers MCP server, enter the following as
required:
Server name : the name of the remote MCP server or toolset—for
example, "BigQuery MCP server".
Server or toolset URL or Endpoint : the MCP endpoint of the server or
toolset you want to use—for example,
https://bigquery.googleapis.com/mcp or
https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/mcp/models .
Transport : HTTP
Authentication details : Depending on how you want to authenticate, you can
enter your Google Cloud credentials, your OAuth client ID
and secret, or an agent identity and credentials. For more information on
authentication, see Authenticate to MCP servers .
OAuth scope : the OAuth 2.0 scope that
you want to use when connecting to the MCP server—for example,
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery . Different scopes are
required for different levels of access. To determine the required scope for
the MCP server, refer to the server's documentation.
Client-specific guidance
For application-specific instructions consult the following sections.
Gemini CLI
To add a Google or Google Cloud remote MCP server to your Gemini CLI,
configure it as an extension and
authenticate
using Google Application Default Credentials (ADC).
Use your gcloud CLI credentials to configure your
Application Default Credentials (ADC) :
gcloud auth application-default login
If the MCP server you're using requires OAuth scopes beyond the default
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scope, then
use the
--scopes flag
to include those scopes.
Create an extension file in the following location:
~/.gemini/extensions/ EXT_NAME /gemini-extension.json where
~/ is your home directory and EXT_NAME is the name you want to
give the extension.
Save the following content in your extension file:
{
"name" : " EXT_NAME " ,
"version" : "1.0.0" ,
"mcpServers" : {
" MCP_SERVER_NAME " : {
"httpUrl" : " MCP_ENDPOINT " ,
"authProviderType" : "google_credentials" ,
"oauth" : {
"scopes" : [ " SCOPE " ]
},
"timeout" : 30000 ,
"headers" : {
"x-goog-user-project" : " PROJECT_ID "
}
}
}
}
Replace the following:
EXT_NAME : the name of the extension.
MCP_SERVER_NAME : the name of the MCP server. MCP server names must start with a
letter or an underscore, and must only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), underscores
(_), dots (.), colons (:), or dashes (-), with a maximum length of 64.
MCP_ENDPOINT : the endpoint of the MCP server—for example,
https://bigquery.googleapis.com/mcp .
SCOPE : the OAuth scope
for the MCP server.
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
For services that don't require OAuth scopes, you can omit the
"oauth" section.
For services like Antigravity
that support bearer tokens, add the "Authorization" parameter to the
"headers" section of the JSON file:
{
...
"headers" : {
"Authorization" : "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN " ,
"x-goog-user-project" : " PROJECT_ID "
}
Replace YOUR_TOKEN with your bearer token. You can generate a
token by running the
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token command .
Start Gemini CLI:
gemini
Run /mcp to view your configured MCP server and its tools.
The response is similar to the following:
Configured MCP servers :
🟢 BigQuery ( from bigquery - mcp ) - Ready ( 5 tools )
Tools :
- execute_sql
- get_dataset_info
- get_table_info
- list_dataset_ids
- list_table_ids
The remote MCP server is ready to use in Gemini CLI.
