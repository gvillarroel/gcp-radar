Connect Cloud Build to a Private Service Connect instance
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can connect Cloud Build to a Secure Source Manager
Private Service Connect instance using
Cloud Build private pools .
Alternatively, you can use Secure Source Manager with Developer Connect to
do this. For more information, see
Developer Connect .
Before you begin
Create a Private Service Connect Secure Source Manager instance .
If you previously configured the endpoints for your
Private Service Connect instance, then you must disconnect them. To
release your endpoints, follow the instructions in
Release a static internal IPv4 or IPv6 address .
Enable the Cloud Build, Service Networking, and Compute Engine APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to connect Cloud Build to a Private Service Connect Secure Source Manager instance,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Access Context Manager Admin role ( roles/accesscontextmanager.policyAdmin )
IAM role on the organization.
Configure your service account
To follow the principle of least privilege in
Cloud Build, you can configure Cloud Build to use a service
account with just enough privileges to execute a build.
If you don't specify a service account, Cloud Build might automatically
select a service account to execute builds on your behalf. This service account
might have permissions that are unnecessarily broad for your use-case, like
access to your Secure Source Manager instance and any repositories in your project.
Create a service account if you don't already have one you want
to use.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
settings Secure Source Manager Permissions page:
Go to Permissions
In the Service account permissions tab, select the service account you
want to use as the Cloud Build service account.
Optionally, select Set as preferred service account to pre-populate
your service account when you create new triggers.
Grant the service account required permissions
Grant the service account the required Cloud Build roles for your
use-case. For information on what Cloud Build roles are required for
different Cloud Build actions, see
Configuring access to Cloud Build .
To grant the service account permissions to retrieve the CA certificate,
run the following command.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding CA_PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: SA_EMAIL \
--role = roles/privateca.auditor \
--condition = None
Replace the following:
CA_PROJECT_ID : with the project ID of the CA pool project.
SA_EMAIL : with the email of the service account you set as
your Cloud Build service account.
To grant the service account permissions to access the Secure Source Manager
instance, run the following command.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding INSTANCE_PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: SA_EMAIL \
--role = roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor \
--condition = None
To grant the service account permissions to read from Secure Source Manager
repositories, run the following command.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding INSTANCE_PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: SA_EMAIL \
--role = roles/securesourcemanager.repoReader \
--condition = None
Set up build logs
When you specify your own service account for builds, you must store your build
logs either in Cloud Logging or in a user-created Cloud Storage bucket. You
can't store your logs in the default logs bucket.
To store build logs in Cloud Logging, grant the
Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) role to your
Cloud Build service account.
For more information on how to set up your build logs, see
Configure user-specified service accounts .
Create a private Cloud DNS zone
To create a managed private Cloud DNS zone, run the following command.

--networks = "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK "
Replace the following:
ZONE_NAME : with the name you want to give the managed-zone.
PROJECT_ID : with the project ID of the Google Cloud project you
want to use for the Cloud DNS zone.
DESCRIPTION : with a description for the zone.
INSTANCE_LOCATION : with the location where you want to create
your Secure Source Manager instance.
For more information on managed private Cloud DNS zones, see
Cloud DNS overview .
Configure your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network
Reserve an IP range that you want to use to peer the Secure Source Manager
VPC with the Cloud Build private pool.
gcloud compute addresses create CB_PEER_RANGE \
--global \
--purpose = VPC_PEERING \
--prefix-length = 24 \
--description = "IP range for peering with Cloud Build private pool" \
--network = NETWORK \
--project = INSTANCE_PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CB_PEER_RANGE : with the name of the address to create.
NETWORK : with the network resource in which the addresses
should be reserved. If you're using the
default network , the value is default .
INSTANCE_PROJECT_ID : with the Private Service Connect
instance project ID.
To create a VPC peering with
servicenetworking.googleapis.com , run the following command.
gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
--service = servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--ranges = CB_PEER_RANGE \
--network = NETWORK \
--project = INSTANCE_PROJECT_ID
To create a peered DNS domain to connect with Cloud Build, run the
following command.
gcloud services peered-dns-domains create DNS_PEERING_DOMAIN \
--network = NETWORK \
--project = INSTANCE_PROJECT_ID \
--dns-suffix = INSTANCE_LOCATION .p.sourcemanager.dev.
Replace the following:
DNS_PEERING_DOMAIN : with the name of the peered DNS domain
you are creating.

--project = INSTANCE_PROJECT_ID
Where:
ILB_PROXY_SUBNET_NAME is the name of the subnet to create.
CIDR_RANGE is the primary IP address range of the subnet. You
must use a subnet mask no longer than 26 so that at least 64 IP
addresses are available for proxies in the region. The recommended subnet
mask length is /23 . For more information on proxy-only subnets, see
Proxy-only subnets for Envoy-based load balancers .
To create L4 ILB for the HTTP connection NEG, run the following command.
