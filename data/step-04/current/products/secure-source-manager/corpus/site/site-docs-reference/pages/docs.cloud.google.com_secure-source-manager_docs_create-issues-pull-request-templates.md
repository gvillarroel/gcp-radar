Templates overview
Issues and pull request templates let you standardize the
information contributors provide to a repository. Issue templates offer
predefined options a user can choose from depending on the type of issue they
are submitting and the template types available. A pull request template is
automatically applied to all pull requests, ensuring consistent contributions to
the repository.
Templates can be created by anyone with permission to merge files in a
repository.
Create an issues template
Secure Source Manager lets you define issues templates using Markdown files in multiple
locations in your repository. You can create multiple issue templates for
different purposes. For example, you may want to have a separate templates for
reporting bugs and submitting feature requests.
Create a template that begins with the following information, in this exact
format:
---
name: TEMPLATE_NAME
about: Insert description of template
title: Placeholder title for the new issue when it is created
---
Provide a name, and description. These are required and are used in the UI
of the New Issues page.
You can optionally include a title that is used as a placeholder title when a
new issue is created.
Below the required material, include any information you would like to
be visible in the issue description that will assist users in providing
necessary information.
Save your template as a Markdown file in one of the following locations:
/.securesourcemanager/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/
/.securesourcemanager/issue_templates/
Note: If templates are found in more than one location, Secure Source Manager uses the
template from the first folder in your directory.
Default issues template
Secure Source Manager also supports the definition of a single default template. This
template should be defined in one of the following locations:
/.securesourcemanager/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
/.securesourcemanager/issue_template.md
When a user creates a new issue, Secure Source Manager prompts that user to select a
template, if any are available, or selects the default template. If there's no
designated default template, nothing is pre populated into the new issue.
Example Issues template
The first 5 lines of the template must follow the conventions outlined in the
following example. Any additional information can be formatted in Markdown to
suit the needs of the issue type.
---
name: Bug #Used as UI element for the button on the New Issues page
about: Use this template to submit a new bug #Used as description text on the New Issues page
title: [BUG]: <Describe issue> #Used as placeholder name for newly created issue

Create a pull request template
Create a template that begins with the following information, in this exact
format:
---
title: "[PR]: <Insert title>"
---
Below the required material, include any information you would like to
be visible in the issue description to assist users in providing
necessary information. See the example template in the following section for
more details.
Save the template as a Markdown file in one of the following locations inside
a repository:
/.securesourcemanager/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
/.securesourcemanager/pull_request_template.md
When you create a new pull request, Secure Source Manager checks if a template exists in
any of the defined locations and loads it. If you included title information
in your template, it's automatically populated in the new pull request to
provide users with a defined format to follow. Any additional information you
included is added to the pull request description to be updated by the
submitting user.
Example Pull Request template
The first 3 lines of the template must follow the conventions shown in the
following example. Everything that follows is options and should assist your
users in creating pull requests that follow your conventions.
