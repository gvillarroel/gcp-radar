Connect to Jenkins
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can start automatic builds with Jenkins
triggers and Secure Source Manager webhooks.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create Jenkins build triggers,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Secure Source Manager Repo Admin ( roles/securesourcemanager.repoAdmin )
on your repository
Secure Source Manager Instance Accessor ( roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor )
on the Secure Source Manager instance
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
For information on granting Secure Source Manager roles,
see Access control with IAM and
Grant users instance access .
Set up a webhook trigger
Jenkins uses build trigger plugins to enable CI/CD automation. You can
configure triggers to listen for incoming events, such as when a new commit is
pushed to a repository or when a pull request is initiated, and then
automatically execute a build when new events come in. You can also configure
triggers to build code on any changes to your source repository or only on
changes that match certain criteria.
To set up a generic Jenkins webhook Trigger:
Install the Jenkins Git Plugin ,
SSH Credential Plugin and
Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin
on your Jenkins server.
Generate a valid SSH key pair in your Jenkins server.
Secure Source Manager only supports RSA type keys.
Add the Secure Source Manager instance domain to the
Jenkins server SSH known_hosts file by running the following command:
ssh -t git@ INSTANCE_ID - INSTANCE_PROJECT_NUMBER -ssh.us-central1.sourcemanager.dev
Where:
INSTANCE_ID is the name of your Secure Source Manager
instance.
INSTANCE_PROJECT_NUMBER is the project number of your
Secure Source Manager instance. See
Identifying projects
for information on where to find your project number.
For example, the following command adds the instance domain for an instance
named prod-test-instance with a project number of 123456789 .
ssh -t git@prod-test-instance-123456789-ssh.us-central1.sourcemanager.dev
Reply yes to add the instance domain to the list of known hosts.
In the Jenkins Manage Credentials page:
Select SSH username with private key .
Paste in your Jenkins server SSH private key.
In the Kind drop-down, fill in the other fields as required.
Click Create .
In the Jenkins web interface, create a new Jenkins job.
In the Jenkins job's configuration page, under the
Source Code Management section, select Git .
In the Git section, paste the Secure Source Manager repository SSH
URL as the Repository URL, enter your build branches (e.g. */main ), and
then select the saved private SSH key credential that you added previously
in the Manage Credentials page.
In the Build Triggers section, select Generic Webhook Trigger .
Optionally, you can add a token so that the job is only triggered if that
token is supplied when invoking. To add a token, under the
Generic Webhook Trigger section, you can input a token in the Token
field.
In the Build section, provide a build script you would
like to have for this Jenkins job. For example, you can execute cat
README.md to print the content of README.md.
Click Save to create the Jenkins job.
Set up a service account and grant required permissions
If you don't already have a service account that you want to use,
create a service account .
Ensure you have the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on the service
account. This permission is part of the Service Account User
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) role.
In the Secure Source Manager web interface, click the more_vert
more options menu.
Click Service account SSH keys . The Service account SSH keys page
opens, and a list of any existing keys you've added is displayed.
Click Add key .
In the Add SSH key page, enter the following values
for your key:
Service account : the service account email for the service
account you want to use the SSH key with in the format
SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
Where
SA_NAME is the service account name.
PROJECT_ID is the project ID of the project the service
account was created in.
SSH Public Key : Your Jenkins public SSH key.
Grant the Secure Source Manager service agent permissions
If the service account is not in the same project as your
Secure Source Manager instance you must also grant the
Secure Source Manager
service agent
the Service Account Token Creator ( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) role
or iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt permission.
If your service account is in the same project as your
Secure Source Manager instance, skip to
Grant the service account a repository role .
Run the following command to get the existing IAM
policy for your service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
--format json
Where SERVICE_ACCOUNT is the service account you want to use.
The account should be formatted either as a numeric service account ID
or as an email, like this: 123456789876543212345 or
my-iam-account@somedomain.com .
The output includes any existing bindings, or, if none exist, the etag
value similar to the following:
{
"etag" : "BwUjHYKJUiQ="
}
Important: keep the etag value from the get-iam-policy
response to ensure that you don't overwrite someone else's policy
changes. If you want to overwrite all other changes, you can remove the
etag value.
Copy the output into a new file named policy.json .
To grant the Secure Source Manager service agent the Service Account
Token Creator ( roles/iam.ServiceAccountTokenCreator ) role, modify the
policy.json to add the following:
{
"role" : "roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service- INSTANCE_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-sourcemanager.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
]
}
Where INSTANCE_PROJECT_NUMBER is the project number of your
Secure Source Manager instance.
Run the following command to replace the existing IAM
policy for the service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts set-iam-policy SERVICE_ACCOUNT POLICY_FILE
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT with the service account ID or email.
POLICY_FILE with the location and name of the JSON
formatted file including the new policy.
Grant the service account a repository role
In the Secure Source Manager web interface, navigate to the repository you want
to give the service account permissions in.
Click the Permissions tab.
Click Add Users .
In the Add principal field, enter the service account email address.
In the Role drop-down menu, select
Secure Source Manager Repository Reader .
Assign the service account the
securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor role by running the following
command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: SA_EMAIL \
--role = roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID with the Secure Source Manager instance project ID.
SA_EMAIL with the service account email.
Set up a webhook
In the Secure Source Manager web interface, navigate to the repository you want
to create a webhook for.
Click Settings .
Click Webhooks , and then click Add webhook .
In the Hook ID field, enter an ID for the webhook.
Note: Hook IDs must follow the
resource naming convention .
They must include only lower case letters, numbers, or dashes, must
begin with a letter, and cannot be changed after creating the webhook.
In the Target URL field, enter the Jenkins Trigger URL.
If you used the optional token when configuring your Jenkins trigger, then
the Jenkins trigger URL will contain that token at the end. To prevent
leaking the token, remove it from the end of the target URL and copy to the
Sensitive Query String field.
To locate your token in your trigger URL, look for the text starting with
token=
For example, if your URL resembles the following:
https://jenkins-server.com/generic-webhook-trigger/invoke?token=jenkins-job1
Copy and remove the portion starting with the question mark
?token=jenkins-job1 portion from the Target URL field. Then remove the
initial question mark, move the remaining portion token=jenkins-job1 to
the Sensitive Query String field.
In the Trigger on section, select one of the following:
Push : to trigger on a push to the repository.
Pull request state changed : to trigger on a change in the pull
request state.
If you selected Push , then you can enter an allowlist for push events in
the Branch filter field.
The Branch filter field uses the glob pattern and only operations on the
matched branches will cause a build trigger. If the field is empty or * ,
then push events for all branches are reported.
Click Add webhook .
The webhook is displayed in the Webhooks page.
Note: When you add or edit a webhook, the length of the
Sensitive Query String might be inconsistent with the entered one, which
is expected as placeholder strings are used to ensure security.
Test your webhook
In the Secure Source Manager Webhooks page, click the webhook you want
to test.
Go to the bottom of the page and click Test delivery .
A fake event is added to the delivery queue. It might take a few seconds
before it shows up in the delivery history.
You can also use a git command to push or merge a pull request to test the
webhook.
In the Jenkins project, view the build triggered by the test event in
Build History .
You can also view the Request and Response to the test delivery
in the Recent deliveries section of the Secure Source Manager webhook
page after you send your first test delivery.
