Create a Secure Source Manager instance to use with federated identities
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Learn how to create a Secure Source Manager instance
that uses Workforce Identity Federation with an external identity provider
(IdP).
For more information about Workforce Identity Federation, see
Workforce Identity Federation .
For information about limitations
to Workforce Identity Federation in Secure Source Manager, see
Identity federation: products and limitations .
Secure Source Manager is a single-tenant service. A single
Secure Source Manager instance should only include users from one
Google Cloud customer unless multiple companies who have a contractual
relationship need to use a single instance for collaboration.
If you're working with multiple companies and want to collaborate with them on
source code, we recommend you create a separate instance for each company.
Note: Secure Source Manager doesn't support domain-scoped projects.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Account. If you don't already have one,
sign up for a new account .
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Enable the Secure Source Manager API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.

Enable the Secure Source Manager API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Data encryption
By default, Google Cloud automatically
encrypts data at rest using
Google-owned and Google-managed encryption keys. If you have specific compliance or regulatory
requirements related to the keys that protect your data, you can create
Secure Source Manager instances that are encrypted with
customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) .
Don't store sensitive data in instance IDs or label key-value pairs because they
are not encrypted with CMEK.
If you are creating your first Secure Source Manager
instance in your project, you must manually create the
Secure Source Manager service agent by running the following command:
gcloud beta services identity create \
--service = securesourcemanager.googleapis.com \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Here, PROJECT_ID is the project ID of the project where you create your Secure Source Manager instance.
After you create the per-product, per-project service account (P4SA), you must
grant the Secure Source Manager Service Agent role
( roles/securesourcemanager.serviceAgent ) to principal
service-PROJECT-NUMBER@gcp-sa-sourcemanager.iam.gserviceaccount.com
or the instance creation will fail.
Set up Workforce Identity Federation
Before you create an instance, you must set up a Workforce Identity Federation
pool and provider.
Create a Workforce Identity Federation pool .
Note: The session duration for your workforce identity pool defaults to
one hour. We recommend increasing the duration to prevent
users from reauthenticating repeatedly during their workday.
Configure your workforce identity pool provider
with the following attribute mappings :
google.subject
google.email
Create an instance
gcloud
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
INSTANCE_ID : the name of the instance you want to create.
LOCATION : the region where you want to create the instance. For information on supported locations, see Locations .
PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the project you want to create an instance in.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud source-manager instances create INSTANCE_ID --region = LOCATION --project = PROJECT_ID --enable-workforce-identity-federation
Windows (PowerShell)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud source-manager instances create INSTANCE_ID --region = LOCATION --project = PROJECT_ID --enable-workforce-identity-federation
Windows (cmd.exe)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud source-manager instances create INSTANCE_ID --region = LOCATION --project = PROJECT_ID --enable-workforce-identity-federation
A long-running create instance operation starts. The output looks like the following:
Create request issued for [my-instance].
done: false
metadata:
'@type': type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.securesourcemanager.v1.OperationMetadata
apiVersion: v1
createTime: '2023-02-27T20:57:52.315609549Z'
requestedCancellation: false
target: projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/instances/my-instance
verb: create
name: projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/operations/operation-1234567894561-5ec69948c0f2b-60dd727f-a9b97a2e
Where projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/operations/operation-1234567894561-5ec69948c0f2b-60dd727f-a9b97a2e is the OPERATION_NAME .
Record the OPERATION_NAME as you will need to use it to check the status of the operation.
It takes up to 60 minutes to create the instance.
API
Before you run this command, replace the following values:
INSTANCE_ID : the name of the
instance you want to create.
LOCATION : the region where you
want to create the instance. For information about supported locations, see
Locations .
PROJECT_ID : the project ID of
the project you want to create an instance in.
Run the following command:
curl \
-X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
https://securesourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /instances?instance_id = INSTANCE_ID \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d "{workforce_identity_federation_config: {enabled: true}}"
A long-running create instance operation starts. The output resembles the following:
{
"name" : " OPERATION_NAME " ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.securesourcemanager.v1.OperationMetadata" ,
"createTime" : "2022-11-01T14:31:32.420469714Z" ,
"target" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /instances/ INSTANCE_ID " ,
"verb" : "create" ,
"requestedCancellation" : false,
"apiVersion" : "v1"
} ,
"done" : false
}
This example output includes the following values:
OPERATION_NAME : the operation name—for example,
projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/operations/operation-1234567894561-5ec69948c0f2b-60dd727f-a9b97a2e .
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project.
LOCATION : the region where the instance is located.
Record the OPERATION_NAME because you need to use
it to check the status of the operation.
It takes up to 60 minutes to create the instance.
Terraform
The following example creates a Secure Source Manager instance with
Workforce Identity Federation enabled:
resource "google_secure_source_manager_instance" "instance" {
instance_id = " INSTANCE_ID "
location = " LOCATION "
project = " PROJECT_ID "
workforce_identity_federation_config {
enabled = true
}
}

it's possible for the status check to report completion before the instance is fully operational. If you encounter errors accessing the instance after creation, wait 60 minutes and try again before reaching out for assistance through Secure Source Manager Support at secure-source-manager-support@google.com .
Copy the HTML URL from the successful check status response. You need this URL to access the instance through its web interface.
Access the instance
After the instance is created, you can access it through its web interface using
a browser.
Note: To create repositories in the
instance you need the Repo Creator role
( roles/securesourcemanager.repoCreator ) on the instance project and the
Instance Repository Creator role
( roles/securesourcemanager.instanceRepositoryCreator ) on the Secure Source Manager
instance.
To access the Secure Source Manager instance through its web interface, copy the following URL
into your browser address bar.
INSTANCE_ID - PROJECT_NUMBER . LOCATION .sourcemanager.dev
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_ID with the instance name.
PROJECT_NUMBER with the instance's Google Cloud
project number. For information on identifying projects, see
Identifying projects .
LOCATION with the instance's region.
An OAuth screen appears requesting your provider name.
Enter your workforce identity provider's name in the following format:
locations/global/workforcePools/ POOL_ID /providers/ PROVIDER_ID
Replace the following:
POOL_ID with your Workforce Identity Federation pool ID.
PROVIDER_ID with your Workforce Identity Federation provider
ID.
For more information about Workforce Identity Federation pools and providers, see
Manage Workforce Identity Federation identity pools and providers .
You are prompted to sign in using your provider credentials.
Sign in using your provider credentials.
The Secure Source Manager web interface opens. From here, you can create and view repositories, issues, and pull requests.
You must sign in again through the web interface after the
session duration in your Workforce Identity Federation pool expires.
Create your gcloud CLI login configuration
To authenticate with your workforce identity pool credentials to your
Secure Source Manager instance using gcloud CLI commands or Git
commands, you must create a login configuration with your workforce identity
pool.
To create a workforce identity pool login configuration, follow the instructions
in Obtain short-lived tokens for Workforce Identity Federation to
create a browser-based sign-in with the gcloud CLI.
After you have authenticated, you can use Git commands to interact with
your Secure Source Manager instance. To get started with Git, see Use Git source code management .
