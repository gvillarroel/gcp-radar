Configure branch protection
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to configure branch protection for
Secure Source Manager repositories.
Branch protection lets repository administrators set rules to control who can
make changes to branches, who needs to approve or review changes, and what
conditions must be met before an approved change can be merged into a branch.
For more information about branch protection rules, see Branch protection
overview .
Before you begin
Create a Secure Source Manager instance .
Create a Secure Source Manager repository .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to configure branch protection rules for a Secure Source Manager repository,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Secure Source Manager Instance Accessor ( roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor )
on the Secure Source Manager instance
Secure Source Manager Repository Admin ( roles/securesourcemanager.repoAdmin )
on the Secure Source Manager repository
To approve pull requests on protected branches in any repository in a Secure Source Manager instance:
Secure Source Manager Repository Pull Request Approver ( roles/securesourcemanager.repoPullRequestApprover )
on the Google Cloud project for the instance
Secure Source Manager Repository Writer ( roles/securesourcemanager.repoWriter )
on the Google Cloud project for the instance
To approve pull requests on protected branches in a single repository:
Secure Source Manager Repository Pull Request Approver ( roles/securesourcemanager.repoPullRequestApprover )
on the repository
Secure Source Manager Repository Writer ( roles/securesourcemanager.repoWriter )
on the repository
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
For information on granting Secure Source Manager roles,
see Access control with IAM and
Grant users instance access .
Create a branch protection rule
Console
To create a new branch protection rule, do the following:
In the Secure Source Manager web interface, select the repository you
want to protect with a branch protection rule.
From the repository page, click Settings .
Click the Branch rule tab.
Click Add branch rule .
In the Branch rule ID field, enter a name for the branch rule.
Branch rule IDs are restricted to lower-case letters, numbers,
and hyphens. The first character must be a letter, and the last character
must be a letter or a number. Branch rule IDs have a 63 character
maximum.
In the Branch filter field, enter the name of the branch you want
the rule to apply to, or if you want the rule to apply to all branches,
enter .* . Full regular expression matching is not supported.
Enabled branch rule filters must be unique to their repository. Users can
have multiple disabled branch rule filters. For example, you can't have two
enabled branch rules in a single repository with the branch filter main .
When multiple rules are applicable for a branch, the branch rule with a
specific branch name as the branch filter will override the wildcard rule.
For example, a branch rule with branch filter main will override a
branch rule with the branch filter .* . Rules are not combined.
In the Branch protection rule details section, specify the
requirements for your branch rule from the following options:
Require a pull request before merging : if enabled, direct
commits to the branch will be blocked. A pull request must be opened
before merging into the protected branch.
Note: You can't apply this rule to all branches using .* , because
that would prevent pushing directly to all branches, even new branches.
Required number of reviewers : specify the number of
reviewers required to approve in order to merge the pull request.
Required number of approvers : specify the number of
approvers required to approve in order to merge the pull request.
Reviewers and approvers are users with specific IAM
roles. To learn which roles are required for reviewers and approvers,
see Branch protection overview .
Block merge on stale reviews and approvals : if enabled, a review
or approval is removed if new commits are pushed to the pull request
after the review or approval is granted.
Require conversation resolution before merging : if enabled,
all code comments and request change reviews must be resolved before
merging.
Require linear history : if enabled, pull requests that would create
a non-linear Git history can't be merged.
Require status checks : if enabled, the selected build status checks
must be successful before a pull request can be merged. You must
configure triggers in your triggers file before
you can select them as status checks for branch protection.
To save the branch rule, click Submit .
The Branch rules tab is displayed, with your new branch rule listed.
Terraform
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see
Basic Terraform commands .
For more information, see the
Terraform provider reference documentation .
To create a new branch protection rule with Terraform, use the
google_secure_source_manager_branch_rule
resource.
The following example configuration creates a branch protection rule for the
main branch.
Before using the sample, replace the following:
BRANCH_RULE_ID : the ID of the branch protection rule.
PROJECT_ID : the project ID.
LOCATION : the location of the repository.
REPOSITORY_ID : the ID of the repository.
BRANCH_NAME_PATTERN : the branch name or regex pattern, such as main .
resource "google_secure_source_manager_branch_rule" "default" {
branch_rule_id = " BRANCH_RULE_ID "
project = " PROJECT_ID "
location = " LOCATION "
repository_id = " REPOSITORY_ID "
include_pattern = " BRANCH_NAME_PATTERN "
minimum_approvals_count = 2
minimum_reviews_count = 2
require_comments_resolved = true
require_linear_history = true
require_pull_request = true
disabled = false
allow_stale_reviews = false
}
Modify a branch protection rule
To modify a branch protection rule, do the following:
In the Secure Source Manager web interface, select the repository with
the branch protection rule you want to modify.
From the repository page, click Settings .
Click the Branch rules tab.
Click the name of the branch rule you want to modify.
Edit the branch protection rule.
Click Update .
The branch protection rule is updated.
Delete a branch protection rule
To delete a branch protection rule, do the following:
In the Secure Source Manager web interface, select the repository that
you want to remove the branch rule from.
From the repository page, click Settings.
Click the Branch rule tab.
In the row of the rule you want to delete, click the Delete
icon.
In the Remove branch rule confirmation screen, click Yes .
The branch protection rule is deleted.
