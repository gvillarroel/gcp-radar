Use Git source code management
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Secure Source Manager supports all
Git SCM
client commands and has built in pull requests and issue tracking. Both HTTPS
and
SSH authentication
are supported.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to use Git to interact with a Secure Source Manager repository,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Secure Source Manager Instance Accessor ( roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor )
on the Secure Source Manager instance
To clone a repository:
Secure Source Manager Repo Reader ( roles/securesourcemanager.repoReader )
on the repository
To push to a repository:
Secure Source Manager Repo Writer ( roles/securesourcemanager.repoWriter )
on the repository
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
For information on granting Secure Source Manager roles,
see Access control with IAM and
Grant users instance access .
Install Git and Google Cloud CLI
Install
Git .
If you are prompted to Choose a credential helper by the Git installer,
select None (Do not use a credential helper) .
Install the gcloud CLI .
The gcloud CLI version 395.0.0 or later is required to use Git
with HTTPS. To check your gcloud CLI version run the
following command:
gcloud --version
To update the gcloud CLI run the following command.
gcloud components update
After updating, run gcloud init to
initialize the gcloud CLI .
See the gcloud CLI documentation on
updating components
for more information.
Set up your credentials
If you authenticate to Secure Source Manager using a third-party identity
provider and Workforce Identity Federation, you don't need to complete this
section—instead, you must
create a workforce identity pool login configuration .
Add the Secure Source Manager authentication helper to your global Git config
by running the following command:
Linux
git config --global credential. 'https://*.*.sourcemanager.dev' .helper gcloud.sh
Earlier versions of Git might not support wildcards. To add the
authentication helper without wildcards, run the following command:
git config --global credential. 'https:// INSTANCE_ID - PROJECT_NUMBER -git. LOCATION .sourcemanager.dev' .helper gcloud.sh
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_ID with the name of your
Secure Source Manager instance.
PROJECT_NUMBER with your project number. For help
finding your project number, see
Identifying projects .
LOCATION with the instance's region. For more
information on regions, see Locations .
Windows
git config --global credential.https://*.*.sourcemanager.dev.helper gcloud.cmd
Earlier versions of Git might not support wildcards. To add the
authentication helper without wildcards, run the following command:
git config --global credential.https:// INSTANCE_ID - PROJECT_NUMBER -git. LOCATION .sourcemanager.dev.helper gcloud.cmd
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_ID with the name of your
Secure Source Manager instance.
PROJECT_NUMBER with your project number. For help
finding your project number, see
Identifying projects .
LOCATION with the instance's region. For more
information on regions, see Locations .
The authentication helper uses the gcloud CLI to fetch your
Google Cloud credentials when using Git commands with
Secure Source Manager.
To re-authenticate after the initial credential setup, run the following
gcloud CLI command:
gcloud auth login
Note: some systems might try to store credentials fetched by
authentication helpers by adding a line to your Git config similar to
*credential*.helper=store . Since the Secure Source Manager credentials are
short lived, this will cause authentication errors. To fix this issue, remove
the line from your global, system, or local repository Git config file.
Authenticate from a Compute Engine VM using a service account
You can authenticate from a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) by using an
attached service account.
Configure the VM and service account
If you use the Compute Engine default service account, create your VM
with the required OAuth scopes:
gcloud compute instances create VM_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--zone = ZONE \
--scopes = openid,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
Replace the following:
VM_NAME : the name for your VM.
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
ZONE : the zone for your VM.
If you use a custom service account, create the service account and then create
the VM.
Create a service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create SA_NAME --project = PROJECT_ID
Replace SA_NAME with a name for the service account.
Grant permission to use the service account. To create a VM with a service
account, you need the
Service Account User role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) on the service account. Grant this role to
the principal creating the VM:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member = "user: USER_EMAIL " \
--role = "roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
Replace USER_EMAIL with the email of the user creating
the VM.
Create the VM:
gcloud compute instances create VM_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--zone = ZONE \
--scopes = openid,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \
--service-account = SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
Grant IAM roles to the service account
Grant the service account access to the Secure Source Manager instance and repository:
Grant instance access:
SA_EMAIL = $( gcloud compute instances describe VM_NAME --project = PROJECT_ID --zone = ZONE --format = "get(serviceAccounts[0].email)" )
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: $SA_EMAIL " \
--role = roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor
Grant repository read access.
To grant read access to a specific repository, run the following command:
gcloud ssm repos add-iam-policy-binding REPOSITORY_ID \
--instance = INSTANCE_ID \
--location = LOCATION \
--member = "serviceAccount: $SA_EMAIL " \
--role = roles/securesourcemanager.repoReader
Replace the following:
REPOSITORY_ID : The repository ID.
INSTANCE_ID : The Secure Source Manager instance ID.
LOCATION : The region of the Secure Source Manager instance.
To grant write access, use the role roles/securesourcemanager.repoWriter .
Granting access at the repository level is recommended to follow the
principle of least privilege. If you need to grant access to all
repositories in a project, see
Access control with IAM .
IAM permissions can take a few minutes to propagate.
Configure Git on the VM
Connect to the VM using SSH:
gcloud compute ssh VM_NAME --project = PROJECT_ID --zone = ZONE
On the VM, install Git:
sudo apt-get install git
On the VM, configure the Git credential helper as described in
Set up your credentials . For example, on Linux:
git config --global credential. 'https://*.*.sourcemanager.dev' .helper gcloud.sh
After you configure the credential helper, Git uses the Application Default
Credentials from the VM's service account to authenticate to
Secure Source Manager. You can now
clone a repository . You must use the HTTPS repository URL
to authenticate with Application Default Credentials.
Create a workforce identity pool login configuration
You don't need to complete this section unless you're using
Workforce Identity Federation to authenticate to Secure Source Manager with a
third-party identity provider.
To authenticate with your workforce identity pool credentials to your
Secure Source Manager instance using gcloud CLI commands or Git
commands, you must create a login configuration with your workforce identity
pool.
To create a workforce identity pool login configuration, follow the instructions
in Obtain short-lived tokens for Workforce Identity Federation to
create a browser-based sign-in with the gcloud CLI.
After you have authenticated, you can use Git commands to interact with
your Secure Source Manager instance. You must re-authenticate when the
session duration for your workforce identity pool expires.
Clone a repository
Clone a repository by running the following command:
git clone REPOSITORY_URL
Where REPOSITORY_URL is the HTTPS or SSH URL displayed at the top
of the repository page you want to clone.
Clone with Developer Connect
You can clone repositories using the Developer Connect Git proxy if you
have linked your Secure Source Manager repository in
Developer Connect. Cloning with Developer Connect uses
IAM to authenticate and authorize repository access.
Before you begin
Follow the instructions to create a connection to a Secure Source Manager repository
in Developer Connect.
Ensure Git proxy is enabled on your Developer Connect connection.
See Configure and use Developer Connect proxy
for instructions on enabling Git proxy.
Grant principals that need to clone using the proxy URI the
roles/developerconnect.gitProxyReader role on the
GitRepositoryLink resource in Developer Connect. See
Developer Connect access control with IAM
for instructions on granting roles.
Set up credentials for Developer Connect
Add the Developer Connect authentication helper to your global Git config
by running the following command:
Linux
git config --global credential. 'https://*.developerconnect.dev' .helper gcloud.sh
Windows
git config --global credential.https://*.developerconnect.dev.helper gcloud.cmd
Clone using the proxy URI
To clone a repository using the Developer Connect proxy URI, run the
following command:
git clone https:// REGION -git.developerconnect.dev/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /connections/ CONNECTION_ID /gitRepositoryLinks/ LINK_ID
Replace the following:
REGION : The region of your Developer Connect resources.
PROJECT_ID : The Project ID of your Developer Connect resources.
CONNECTION_ID : The ID of your Developer Connect connection.
LINK_ID : The ID of your Developer Connect GitRepositoryLink resource.
For instructions on viewing your GitRepositoryLink resource details, see
gcloud developer-connect connections git-repository-links .
You can use list or describe subcommands to view link details.
Note: Pushing to Secure Source Manager repositories using the
Developer Connect Git proxy URI is not supported. This is to prevent
writes using the Developer Connect service account identity.
To push changes, use HTTPS or SSH instead.
Push an existing repository to Secure Source Manager
You must create a Secure Source Manager repository to act as a
remote before you can push to it.
To push your existing Git repository to an empty Secure Source Manager
repository you need to add the Secure Source Manager repository as a remote
and push to it.
To set the Secure Source Manager repository as a remote run the following
command:
git remote add origin REPOSITORY_URL
Where REPOSITORY_URL is the HTTPS or SSH URL displayed at the top of the
repository page.
To push to the repository run the following command:
git push -u origin main
