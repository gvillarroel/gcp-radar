Quotas and limits
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document lists the quotas and system limits that apply to
Cloud Shell.
Quotas have default values, but you can typically request
adjustments.
System limits are fixed values that can't be changed.
Google Cloud uses quotas to help ensure fairness and reduce
spikes in resource use and availability. A quota restricts how much of a
Google Cloud resource your Google Cloud project can use. Quotas
apply to a range of resource types, including hardware, software, and network
components. For example, quotas can restrict the number of API calls to a
service, the number of load balancers used concurrently by your project, or the
number of projects that you can create. Quotas protect the community of
Google Cloud users by preventing the overloading of services. Quotas also
help you to manage your own Google Cloud resources.
The Cloud Quotas system does the following:
Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services
Restricts your consumption of those resources
Provides a way to
request changes to the quota value
and automate quota adjustments
In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota
allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that
you're trying to perform fails.
Quotas generally apply at the Google Cloud project
level. Your use of a resource in one project doesn't affect
your available quota in another project. Within a Google Cloud project, quotas
are shared across all applications and IP addresses.
For more information, see the
Cloud Quotas overview .
There are also system limits on Cloud Shell resources.
System limits can't be changed.
To adjust most quotas, use the Google Cloud console.
For more information, see
Request a quota adjustment .
Note: The majority of these limits are not present in
Cloud Workstations .
Cloud Workstations lets you customize, rightsize and secure your
development environment. Upgrade from Cloud Shell to
Cloud Workstations for managed secure development environments provisioned in
your VPC.
Set up Cloud Workstations
to get started.
Usage quotas
The default weekly Cloud Shell quota is 50 hours.
Viewing your weekly Cloud Shell quota
If you reach your quota, you'll need to wait until the date and time specified
before you can use Cloud Shell again or upgrade to
Cloud Workstations.
To view your weekly quota:
Click
Session information and then click Usage quota .
A dialog appears and displays the hours remaining in your quota, the total
number of hours in your quota, and the date and time that the quota resets.
If you need more quota, we strongly recommend
upgrading to Cloud Workstations , which does
not have weekly usage limitations.
Cloud Workstations lets you customize, rightsize and secure your
development environment. Upgrade to Cloud Workstations for managed secure
development environments provisioned in your VPC without usage limits.
Cloud Shell inactivity
Warning: If you delete your $HOME directory, or if you don't access
Cloud Shell for 120 days, Cloud Shell automatically
deletes your $HOME directory and can't recover your files. You'll receive an
email notification before this occurs.
To prevent your $HOME directory from being deleted due to inactivity for 120
days, start a session. For sensitive data you want to store long term, consider
a different solution on Cloud Storage .
Non-interactive usage
Cloud Shell is intended for interactive
use only. Non-interactive sessions are ended automatically after 40 minutes.
Cloud Shell sessions are capped at 12 hours, after which sessions
automatically terminate. You can start a new session immediately after.
Restoring a session after a service limit violation
If your session is
terminated or can't be established because you exceeded a service limit,
Cloud Shell displays an error with a link to a form that allows you
to appeal the limit violation. Click the feedback link and submit the
form with more information about the tasks you were performing before your
session was terminated.
Warning: Violating the Terms of Service will
result in Cloud Shell being disabled for your account.
This constitutes activity that adversely impacts Google Cloud
services, other customers' or their end users' use of services, or the
Google network used to provide these services. Coin mining and network
scanning using Cloud Shell are strictly prohibited.
Limitations and restrictions
Custom installed software packages and persistence
The virtual machine instance that backs your Cloud Shell session
isn't permanently allocated to your Cloud Shell session and terminates
if your session is inactive for 40 minutes. After the instance is terminated, any
modifications that you made outside your $HOME directory are lost.
To have your configurations persist across sessions, consider
customizing your environment .
Users younger than 18 or whose age is unknown
Cloud Shell isn't available to users younger than 18 or whose
age is unknown. By default, Google Workspace for Education blocks access to
Cloud Shell for all users. If your institution has students older
than 18 who you want to have access to age-restricted services including
Cloud Shell, see
Control access to Google services by age
for steps to identify users who are 18 years or older.
Cloud Shell Editor extensions
Cloud Shell Editor does not support the installation of custom editor
extensions. However, the Cloud Shell Editor comes with a set of
essential extensions already installed and kept up-to-date.
.bashrc content
Cloud Shell can produce errors if the .bashrc file is modified or
deleted. The .bashrc file must contain the following lines:
if [ -f "/google/devshell/bashrc.google" ]; then
source "/google/devshell/bashrc.google"
fi
gcloud output formatting
By default, Cloud Shell enables
gcloud accessibility features .
With accessibility features enabled, gcloud table output
is rendered as a flattened list of items.
To restore the default behavior of boxed tables for many commands, append
the following command to the end of your $HOME/.bashrc file:
gcloud config set accessibility/screen_reader false
Slow connection performance
Connecting to a Cloud Shell for the first time involves creating
your home disk and can currently take up to 25 seconds. Subsequent connections
to existing virtual machine instances take about five seconds. However, if you
haven't used Cloud Shell for a week, connection performance will be
slower since the home directory is restored from an archive.
Cloud Shell also offers
Ephemeral mode
which is the Cloud Shell experience without persistent disk
storage. Ephemeral mode offers faster connection performance but all the files
you create in your session are lost on session end.
Browser support
Cloud Shell supports the latest versions of Google Chrome,
Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer 11+, and Apple
Safari 8+. Safari in private browser mode is not supported.
Private browsing and disabled third-party cookies
The Cloud Shell Editor can't load in Cloud Shell
if third-party cookies are disabled. Some browsers have third-party cookies
disabled by default and most browsers' Incognito or Private Browser modes block
these cookies as well.
With third-party cookies disabled, you can still use the
Cloud Shell Editor in its own window by
clicking the Open in New Window button accessible when you open an
editor session .
Alternatively, you can navigate to port 970 using the Web Preview
.
Tip: If you're using Google Chrome, you can enable third-party cookies
by clicking the Third-party cookie blocking icon in your address bar
,
selecting Site not working? , clicking Allow cookies , and reloading your
page.
Disk storage
Cloud Shell provisions 5 GB of free
persistent disk storage mounted as
your $HOME directory on the virtual machine instance. This storage is on
a per-user basis and is available across projects. All files you store in your
home directory, including installed software, scripts, and user configuration
files like .bashrc and .vimrc , persist between sessions and count towards
the 5 GB limit.
Clearing disk space
If you encounter a no space left on device error, free up space by
removing files from your home directory using the Cloud Shell
terminal. Use the du -hs $(ls -A) command to see the space each file uses within each sub-directory. Consider removing those that are no longer needed or take up a large chunk of storage.
Note: If you don't access Cloud Shell regularly, the
$HOME directory persistent storage may be recycled. You receive an
email notification before this occurs. Starting a Cloud Shell
session prevents the persistent storage from being recycled.
