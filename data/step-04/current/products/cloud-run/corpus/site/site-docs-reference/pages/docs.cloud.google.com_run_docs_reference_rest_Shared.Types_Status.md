JSON representation
The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC . Each Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the API Design Guide .
