Container runtime contract
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page lists key requirements and behaviors of containers in
Cloud Run. The page also calls out the differences between Cloud Run
services, Cloud Run jobs, and Cloud Run worker pools where appropriate.
Supported languages and images
Your container image can run code written in the programming language of your
choice and use any base image, provided that it respects the constraints
listed in this page.
Executables in the container image must be compiled for Linux 64-bit.
Cloud Run specifically supports the Linux x86_64 ABI format.
Cloud Run accepts container images in the Docker Image Manifest V2,
Schema 1 ,
Schema 2 , and
OCI image formats.
Cloud Run also accepts Zstd compressed container images.
If deploying a multi-architecture image ,
the manifest list
must include linux/amd64 .
For functions deployed with Cloud Run, you can use one of the
Cloud Run runtime base images
that are published by Google Cloud's buildpacks to receive automatic security and
maintenance updates. See the
Runtime support schedule the supported runtimes.
Container requirements
When deploying containers to Cloud Run, the following requirements must
be met:
Container deployed to services must listen for requests on the correct port
A Cloud Run service starts Cloud Run instances to handle incoming requests.
A Cloud Run instance always has one single ingress container that listens for
requests, and optionally one or more sidecar containers. The following port
configuration details apply only to the ingress container, not to sidecars.
The ingress container within an instance must listen for requests on
0.0.0.0 on the port to which requests are sent.
Notably, the ingress container should not listen on 127.0.0.1 .
By default, requests are sent to 8080 , but you can configure Cloud Run
to send requests to the port of your choice. Cloud Run injects the
PORT environment variable into the ingress container.
VPC network connectivity
Preview
— Cloud Run worker pools
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Cloud Run services and jobs support Direct VPC
egress . This means that they can send
traffic to private resources within your configured VPC network, such as
databases or internal services. Cloud Run services and jobs don't
support Direct VPC ingress .
Cloud Run worker pools support both Direct VPC
egress and Direct VPC ingress . When you configure Direct VPC
for your Cloud Run worker pool deployment, each worker
instance receives a private IP address on the configured network and subnet.
Only resources from your VPC network can connect to the worker pool private IP address endpoint.
For more information about obtaining the private IP addresses of your worker pool
instance, see Retrieve the private IP addresses using the metadata server
(MDS) .
For Cloud Run worker pools with Direct VPC ingress, such as database
connections or any other custom TCP-based protocol, the container must listen
for TCP connections on the port exposed in your container image through the
Dockerfile or specified by the PORT environment variable.
Container running in a job execution must exit upon completion
For Cloud Run jobs, the container must exit with exit code 0 when the
job has successfully completed, and exit with a non-zero exit code when the job
has failed.
Because jobs shouldn't serve requests, the container shouldn't listen on a port or
start a web server.
Transport layer encryption (TLS)
The container shouldn't implement any transport layer security directly. TLS is
terminated by Cloud Run for HTTPS and gRPC, and then requests are proxied as
HTTP/1 or gRPC to the container without TLS.
If you configure a Cloud Run service to
use HTTP/2 end-to-end, your container must handle requests in HTTP/2 cleartext
(h2c) format, because TLS is still terminated automatically by Cloud Run.
Responses (services)
For Cloud Run services, your container must send a response
within the time specified in the
request timeout setting after it
receives a request, including the container startup time.
Otherwise the request is ended and a 504 error is returned.
Response caching and cookies
If your Cloud Run service's response contains a Set-Cookie
header, Cloud Run sets the Cache-Control header to private so
that the response is not cached. This prevents other users from retrieving the
cookie.
Environment variables
Different sets of environment variables are available for Cloud Run
services and jobs.
Environment variables for services
The following environment variables are automatically added to all the running
containers except PORT . The PORT variable is only added to the ingress container:
Name
Description
Example
PORT
The port your HTTP server should listen on.
8080
K_SERVICE
The name of the Cloud Run service being run.
hello-world
K_REVISION
The name of the Cloud Run revision being run.
hello-world.1
K_CONFIGURATION
The name of the Cloud Run configuration that created the revision.
hello-world
Environment variables for jobs
For Cloud Run jobs, the following environment variables are set:
Name
Description
Example
CLOUD_RUN_JOB
The name of the Cloud Run job being run.
hello-world
CLOUD_RUN_EXECUTION
The name of the Cloud Run execution being run.
hello-world-abc
CLOUD_RUN_TASK_INDEX
The index of this task. Starts at 0 for the first task and increments by 1 for every successive task, up to the maximum number of tasks minus 1. If you set --parallelism to greater than 1, tasks might not follow the index order. For example, it would be possible for task 2 to start before task 1.
0
CLOUD_RUN_TASK_ATTEMPT
The number of times this task has been retried. Starts at 0 for the first attempt and increments by 1 for every successive retry, up to the maximum retries value.
0
CLOUD_RUN_TASK_COUNT
The number of tasks defined in the --tasks parameter.
1
Environment variables for worker pools
Cloud Run sets the following environment variables for worker pools:
Name
Description
Example
CLOUD_RUN_WORKER_POOL
The name of the running Cloud Run worker pool.
hello-world
CLOUD_RUN_WORKER_POOL_REVISION
The name of the running Cloud Run worker pool revision.
hello-world.1
Request and response header requirements (services)
For services, Cloud Run restricts header names to printable non-whitespace ASCII, and cannot
contain colons. Cloud Run restricts header values to visible ASCII characters, plus
space and horizontal tab, according to
IETF RFC 7230 .
File system access
Each container's file system is writable and subject to the following
behavior:
It is an in-memory file system, so writing to it uses the
instance's memory.
Data written to the file system doesn't persist when the instance stops.
You cannot specify a size limit for this files system, so you can
potentially use up all the memory allocated to your instance by writing
to the in-memory file system, which will crash the instance. You can avoid this
issue if you use a dedicated in-memory volume
with a size limit.
Instance lifecycle
Lifecycle characteristics differ for Cloud Run jobs and services, so
these are described separately in the following subsections.
For services
The following characteristics apply to services only.
Service scaling
By default, a Cloud Run service is
automatically scaled to the number of
instances needed to handle all incoming requests, events, or
CPU utilization. You can optionally use manual scaling
if you need more control over your scaling behavior.
Every instance runs a fixed number
of containers – one ingress container and optionally one or more sidecar containers.
When a revision does not receive any traffic, it is scaled in to the
minimum number of instances configured
(zero by default).
Startup
For Cloud Run services, your instances must listen for requests within
4 minutes after being started and all containers within
the instance need to be healthy.
During this startup time, instances are allocated CPU. You can
enable startup CPU boost to
temporarily increase CPU allocation during instance startup in order
to reduce startup latency.
Requests will be sent to the ingress container as soon as it is listening on
the configured port .
A request waiting for an instance will be kept pending in a queue as
follows:
Requests will pend for up to 3.5 times average startup time of container instances of this service, or 10 seconds, whichever is greater.
You can configure a startup probe to
determine whether the container has started and is ready to serve requests.
For a Cloud Run service consisting of multi-container instances, you can specify the sequence in which
the containers are started within the instance by configuring the container startup order .
Processing a request
For Cloud Run services, CPU is always allocated to all containers
including sidecars within an instance as long as the Cloud Run
revision is processing at least one request.
Idle
For Cloud Run services, an idle instance is one that is not
processing any requests.
The CPU allocated to all containers in an idle instance depends on the
configured billing settings .
Unless an instance must be kept idle due to
the minimum number of instances
configuration setting, it won't be kept idle for longer than 15 minutes.
Shutdown
For Cloud Run services, an idle instance can be shut down at any time, including
instances kept warm due to a configured minimum number of instances .
If an instance that is processing requests needs to be shut down,
requests already being processed are given time to complete, and new incoming requests are routed to other instances. In exceptional cases, Cloud Run might initiate a shutdown and send a
SIGTERM signal to a container that is still processing requests.
Before shutting down an instance, Cloud Run sends a SIGTERM signal to all the containers in an instance,
indicating the start of a 10 second period
before the actual shutdown occurs, at which point Cloud Run sends a SIGKILL signal.
During this period, the instance is allocated CPU and billed.
In services that use the first generation execution environment, if the
instance does not trap the SIGTERM signal, it is
immediately shut down. In services that use the second generation execution
environment, we recommend installing a
SIGTERM handler on
your container to receive a warning when Cloud Run is about to shut
down an instance.
Forced termination
If one or more Cloud Run containers exceed the
total container memory limit ,
the instance is terminated. All requests that are still processing on the instance
end with an HTTP 500 error.
For jobs
For Cloud Run jobs, container instances run until the container
instance exits, or until the task timeout
is reached or until the container crashes.
Exit codes
You can use job exit codes to see whether the job completed successfully or
whether it encountered any errors. The exit codes are numerical values that map
to successful completion or specific types of errors.
The following table specifies common exit codes and their definitions:
Exit code
Signal
Description
0
Task completed successfully.
4
SIGILL
Task attempted to access memory at an incorrect address.
7
SIGBUS
Task attempted to access memory outside its allocated boundaries.
9
SIGKILL
Task is forcibly terminated, either by user action or manual intervention.
11
SIGSEGV
Task tried to access unauthorized memory.
15
SIGTERM
When a task exceeds its configured timeout or if the task is canceled, it receives a SIGTERM signal. The application server sends the SIGTERM signal for the container instance to shut down. If the instance doesn't shut down on its own within a few seconds after receiving SIGTERM , Cloud Run sends a SIGKILL signal for a forced termination . If the instance exits correctly with SIGTERM , it might report a different error code; otherwise, it returns SIGTERM .
Forced termination
A Cloud Run container instance that exceeds the
allowed memory limit
is terminated. All requests that are still processing on the container instance
end with an HTTP 500 error.
If a task exceeds the task timeout ,
Cloud Run sends a 'SIGTERM' signal indicating the start of a
10 second period before the actual shutdown
occurs, at which point Cloud Run sends a
SIGKILL signal, shutting down the container instance.
During this period, container instances are allocated CPU for their entire
lifecycle and are billed.
Refer to the SIGTERM code sample
to learn how to trap the SIGTERM signal.
For worker pools
The following characteristics apply only to worker pools.
Scaling
Worker pools don't automatically scale. Manually
scale the number of instances
that your Cloud Run worker pool requires to handle its workload. By
default, Cloud Run sets the number of instances to 1 . You can change
this number to be higher or lower, or you can disable scaling by setting the
number to 0. To start and remain active, your workload must have at least one
instance. If you set the minimum instances to 0 , the worker instance won't
start, even if the deployment is successful.
Startup
Cloud Run worker pools instances start the container with
the entrypoint you specify in the container image or in the worker pool
configuration. All containers in the instance must be healthy.
By default, Cloud Run container instances use one CPU. You can
increase or decrease this value based
on your requirements.
You can configure a startup probe
to determine whether the container started.
The startup probe enables Cloud Run to inspect the health of a dependent
container, making sure it passes successfully before it starts up the next container.
If you don't use health checks, Cloud Run starts containers in the
specified order, even if containers they depend on fail to start.
Resource allocation
Worker pools don't idle. Regardless of
its state, Cloud Run always allocates CPU to to all containers,
including sidecars within a worker pool instance.
As long as it's running, an instance is considered active and is billed
accordingly.
Shutdown
Cloud Run doesn't scale down worker pool instances based on idle
instances. If a workload-processing instance must be shut down,
Cloud Run gives tasks in-process tasks time to complete and
routes new workloads to other instances. Cloud Run
might also initiate a shutdown and send a SIGTERM signal to a container that is still
processing a workload.
Before shutting down an instance, Cloud Run sends a SIGTERM signal
to all the containers in an instance. This signal indicates the start of a 10-second period before the actual shutdown
occurs, at which point Cloud Run sends a SIGKILL signal.
During this shutdown period, the instance is allocated CPU and billed.
We recommend installing a
SIGTERM handler on
your container to receive a warning when Cloud Run is about to shut
down an instance.
Forced termination
If one or more Cloud Run containers exceed the
total container memory limit ,
Cloud Run terminates the instance. All requests that are still
processing on the instance end with an HTTP 500 error.
Container instance resources
Your container runs under a cgroup controller that restricts CPU, RAM, and other
resources to those configured for your container.
The following sections describe resources for your container instance:
CPU
Memory
GPU
Concurrency
CPU
Each Cloud Run container in an instance by default gets allocated the vCPU
that has been configured
(1 by default). It is possible to configure CPU limits on each container separately.
A vCPU is implemented as an abstraction of underlying
hardware to provide the approximate equivalent CPU time of a single hardware
hyper-thread on variable CPU platforms. All CPU platforms used by Cloud Run
support the AVX2
instruction set. Note that the container contract does not contain any additional CPU platform details.
The container might be executed on multiple cores simultaneously.
For Cloud Run services, CPU allocation depends on the
selected billing.
If you select instance-based billing, CPU is allocated during the life of the
instance. If you select request-based billing (default), CPU is allocated when
instances are processing requests. Refer to
billing settings for details.
If you have configured a number of
minimum instances , you must use
instance-based billing so that CPU is allocated
outside of requests .
You can enable startup CPU boost to
temporarily increase CPU allocation during instance startup in order
to reduce startup latency.
Memory
Each Cloud Run container by default gets allocated the memory
that has been configured ,
(512 MiB by default). It is possible to configure memory limits on each container separately.
Typical uses of memory include:
Code loaded into memory to run the service
Writing to the file system
Extra processes running in the container such as an nginx server
In-memory caching systems such as the PHP OpCache
Per request memory usage
Shared in-memory volumes
GPU
You can configure a container in a Cloud Run instance to access a GPU.
If the Cloud Run service is deployed with
sidecar containers, only one container in the deployment can access the GPU. See
Configure GPU for requirements and details.
NVIDIA libraries
By default, all of the NVIDIA L4 and NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU driver libraries
are mounted under /usr/local/nvidia/lib64 . Cloud Run automatically
appends this path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
(i.e. ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64 ) of the container with the
GPU. This allows the dynamic linker to find the NVIDIA driver libraries. The
linker searches and resolves paths in the order you list in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable. Any values you specify in this variable take precedence
over the default Cloud Run driver libraries path /usr/local/nvidia/lib64 .
If you want to use a CUDA version greater than 12.2,
the easiest way is to depend on a newer NVIDIA base image
with forward compatibility packages already installed. Another option is to
manually install the NVIDIA forward compatibility packages
and add them to LD_LIBRARY_PATH . Consult NVIDIA's compatibility matrix
to determine which CUDA versions are forward compatible with the provided NVIDIA
driver version.
Concurrency (services)
For Cloud Run services, each Cloud Run instance by default is set to multiple concurrency ,
where the ingress container can receive more than one request at the same time.
You can change this by setting concurrency .
Container security restrictions
The following restrictions apply to containers that run in Cloud Run.
They apply regardless of the Linux user that the container image specifies for
execution.
Reduced privileges
In Cloud Run, your containers are not granted the root
capabilities of the instance's security boundary. Containers cannot perform actions reserved
for the host, such as the following:
Adding or removing Linux kernel capabilities
Using specific kernel capabilities
Manipulating devices
Accessing certain hardware resources
Privilege escalation is also disabled in your containers. Use of sudo and
setuid binaries are not supported in Cloud Run.
Your containers won't have write access to most of the files and directories in
/dev , /proc , and /sys .
There is no Cloud Run equivalent to Docker's --privileged mode.
Container isolation
Cloud Run executes your containers under user, network, PID, and
other Linux namespaces, isolating them from each other and from the instance
itself. This restricts some network capabilities and prevents your root
containers from running as "true root."
Limited file system mounts from inside containers
The supported path for mounting file systems in Cloud Run is
through the fully managed volume mounts feature in your Cloud Run container configuration .
Other mechanisms of mounting from inside user containers are not supported and
won't work. Unsupported mechanisms include, but aren't limited to, the following:
Running a mount process inside the container to mount any of the following:
NFS, Filestore, SMB/CIFS, or any other network file system.
Calling system calls that would perform equivalent actions.
In addition, Cloud Run doesn't support nested volume mounts that
mount one volume inside of another volume.
No alterations to system time
Changing the system time using adjtimex and adjtime system calls is not
supported, nor are any tools that might permit your container to do so.
Process and system call restrictions
Basic security profiles, similar to seccomp security profiles for Docker ,
are applied around each of your containers.
Use of eBPF and other kernel-level security features that aren't protected or
limited by Linux namespaces are disabled and not supported for use inside
containers.
Use of other system calls or access system files that require root privileges on
the Cloud Run instance might also be restricted for this reason.
Container sandbox
If you use the first generation execution environment ,
the Cloud Run containers are sandboxed using
the gVisor container runtime sandbox.
As documented in the gVisor syscall compatibility reference ,
some system calls might not be supported by this container sandbox.
If you use the second generation execution environment ,
you have full Linux compatibility.
Cloud Run jobs always use the second generation execution environment.
Within the second generation execution environment,
/sys/class/dmi/id/product_name is set to Google Compute Engine .
The second generation execution environment runs your service code in a separate
process namespace, so it starts as the container init process which has special
process semantics. In the first generation execution environment, your service
code does not run as the container init process.
File descriptor limits
Cloud Run first and second generation environments set a limit on
the number of file descriptors a process can open to
25000. This applies to the container and any
child process it creates (forks).
This is a hard limit. If you exceed the limit your instance might run out of
file descriptors/sockets.
Limits in the second generation environment
Except for the file descriptor limits described earlier,
limits in the second generation environment are standard linux limits.
For example, the limits on the number of file descriptors that can be
opened (as captured in: /proc/sys/fs/file-max ) use the default value of about
10% of memory. See file-max and file-nr
in the kernel documentation for details.
Similarly, the max_map_count (as captured in /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count ),
which sets the number of memory areas a process can have is using the default
of 65535. See max-map-count
in the kernel documentation for details.
Privileged containers and setuid binaries
Cloud Run doesn't support privileged containers . Consequently, Cloud Run doesn't support binaries that use
setuid flags for non-root users, such as gcsfuse
or sudo , and might fail due to insufficient permissions.
One alternative is to execute these binaries as the root user and
then use the su command to switch to another user at runtime.
For example, in your Dockerfile, remove the USER instruction, and in your
entrypoint script, use the following sequence:
gcsfuse ... # Run gcsfuse as root
su myuser -c "/yourapp.sh" # Switch to 'myuser' and run 'yourapp.sh'
Executing user
If the user name doesn't
exist, Cloud Run runs the container as the root user ( uid=0 ).
Communication between containers of the same instance
Cloud Run adds an entry to the /etc/hosts file in each
container. This entry maps the service names to the localhost IP address
( 127.0.0.1 ). This lets containers communicate with each other using their
container name.
Instance metadata server
Cloud Run instances expose a metadata server that you can use
to retrieve details about your containers, such as the project ID,
region, instance ID or service accounts. You can also use the metadata server to
generate tokens for the service identity .
To access metadata server data, use HTTP requests to the
http://metadata.google.internal/ endpoint with the Metadata-Flavor: Google
header: no client libraries are required. For more information, see
Getting metadata .
The following table lists some of the available metadata server information:
Path
Description
/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id
Project ID of the project the Cloud Run resource belongs to.
/computeMetadata/v1/project/numeric-project-id
Project number of the project the Cloud Run resource belongs to.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/region
Region of this Cloud Run resource, returns projects/ PROJECT-NUMBER /regions/ REGION
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/id
Unique identifier of the instance (also available in logs ).
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/email
Email for the service identity of this Cloud Run resource.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token
Generates an OAuth2 access token for the service account of this Cloud Run resource . The Cloud Run service agent is used to fetch a token. This endpoint will return a JSON response with an access_token attribute. Read more about how to extract and use this access token.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/network-interfaces/0/ip
IPv4 address of a worker pool instance on a VPC network.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/network-interfaces/0/ipv6
IPv6 address of a worker pool instance. Make sure you create your instance under a dual-stack subnet .
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/network-interfaces/ /computeMetadata/v1/instance/network-interfaces/0/
Network interface directory path for worker pools.
Cloud Run doesn't provide details about which
Google Cloud zone the instances
are running in. As a consequence, the metadata attribute /computeMetadata/v1/instance/zone
always returns projects/ PROJECT-NUMBER /zones/ REGION -1 .
File names
The file names that you use in containers must be UTF-8 compatible, either UTF-8
or something that can be safely auto-converted to UTF-8. If your file names use
different encodings, run Docker build on a machine with UTF-8 compatible filenames,
and avoid copying files to a container that contains incompatible UTF-8 names.
Container deployment fails if file names are not UTF-8 compatible. Note that
there's no restriction on the character
encoding you use within a file.
Outbound request timeouts
For Cloud Run services and jobs, there is a timeout after
10 minutes of idle time for requests from your container to
VPC .
For requests from your container to the internet, there is a timeout after
20 minutes of idle time.
Outbound connection resets
Connection streams from your container to both VPC and internet can be
occasionally terminated and replaced when underlying infrastructure is restarted
or updated. If your application reuses long-lived connections, we
recommend that you configure your application to re-establish connections to
avoid the reuse of a dead connection.
