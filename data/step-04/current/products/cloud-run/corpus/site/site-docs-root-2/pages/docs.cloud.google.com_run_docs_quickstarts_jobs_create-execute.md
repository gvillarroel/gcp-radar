Create and execute a job in Cloud Run
This page shows you how to create a job in Cloud Run using
a sample container, execute the job, and view logs for the job.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
If you're using an existing project for this guide,
verify that you have
the permissions required to complete this guide . If you created a new
project, then you already have the required permissions.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Cloud Run Admin API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .

Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to complete this quickstart,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Cloud Run Admin ( roles/run.admin )
on the job
Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser )
on the service identity
Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer )
on the project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create a job
To create a job:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Run page:
Go to Cloud Run
Select Jobs from the Cloud Run navigation menu, and click Deploy container to open the Create job form.
Click Test with a sample container .
In the Region pulldown menu, select the
region
where you want to run the job.
Click Create to create the job.
The job is created and is ready to be executed.
Execute the job
After you create a job, you can execute it:
In the Jobs tab, click the job you just created to open the
Job details page.
Click Execute .
Logs for the job are available as soon as the job execution starts. Click
the Observability tab, then click Logs to view them.
Success: You created and executed a job in Cloud Run.
Cloud Run locations
Cloud Run is regional, which means the infrastructure that
runs your Cloud Run services is located in a specific region and is
managed by Google to be redundantly available across
all the zones within that region .
Meeting your latency, availability, or durability requirements are primary
factors for selecting the region where your Cloud Run services are run.
You can generally select the region nearest to your users but you should consider
the location of the other Google Cloud
products that are used by your Cloud Run service.
Using Google Cloud products together across multiple locations can affect
your service's latency as well as cost.

OK
Clean up
To avoid additional charges to your Google Cloud account, delete all the resources
you deployed with this quickstart.
Delete your repository
Cloud Run only charges for the time your job executes.
However, you might still be charged for storing the container image in
Artifact Registry . To delete Artifact Registry repositories,
follow the steps in Delete
repositories in the Artifact Registry
documentation.
Delete your job
Cloud Run jobs only incur cost when a job task is executing.
To delete your Cloud Run job, follow one of these steps:
Console
To delete a job:
In the Google Cloud console, go to Cloud Run:
Go to Cloud Run
Locate the job you want to delete in the jobs list, and click
its checkbox to select it.
Click Delete . This terminates all the job executions in progress and
all running container instances.
gcloud
To delete a job, run the following command:
gcloud run jobs delete JOB_NAME
Replace JOB_NAME with the name of the job.
Delete your test project
Deleting your Google Cloud project stops billing for all resources in that
project. To release all Google Cloud resources in your project, follow these steps:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
