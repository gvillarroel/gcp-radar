Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster and to view trace spans,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on your project:
Kubernetes Engine Admin ( roles/container.admin )
Cloud Trace User ( roles/cloudtrace.user )
Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser )
Service Usage Admin ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create a GKE cluster
This guide creates a standard GKE cluster. If you use
Autopilot mode for Google Kubernetes Engine or if you enable
Workload Identity Federation for GKE, then you must
configure your application to use Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
In the toolbar, click terminal
Activate Cloud Shell , and then perform the following steps
in the Cloud Shell.
Create a cluster:
gcloud container clusters create cloud-trace-demo --zone us-central1-c
The previous command, which takes several minutes to complete,
creates a standard cluster with the name cloud-trace-demo in the zone
us-central1-c .
Configure kubectl to automatically refresh its credentials to use
the same identity as the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials cloud-trace-demo --zone us-central1-c
Verify access to your cluster:
kubectl get nodes
A sample output of this command is:
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
gke-cloud-trace-demo-default-pool-063c0416-113s Ready <none> 78s v1.22.12-gke.2300
gke-cloud-trace-demo-default-pool-063c0416-1n27 Ready <none> 79s v1.22.12-gke.2300
gke-cloud-trace-demo-default-pool-063c0416-frkd Ready <none> 78s v1.22.12-gke.2300
Download and deploy an application
Download and deploy a Python application, which
uses the Flask framework and the OpenTelemetry package. The application
is described in the About the app section of this page.
In the Cloud Shell, do the following:
Clone a Python app from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples.git
Run the following command to deploy the
sample application:
cd python-docs-samples/trace/cloud-trace-demo-app-opentelemetry && ./setup.sh
The script setup.sh takes several minutes to complete.
The script configures three services using a prebuilt image and then waits
for all resources to be provisioned.
The workloads are named cloud-trace-demo-a ,
cloud-trace-demo-b , and cloud-trace-demo-c .
A sample output of this command is:
deployment.apps/cloud-trace-demo-a is created
service/cloud-trace-demo-a is created
deployment.apps/cloud-trace-demo-b is created
service/cloud-trace-demo-b is created
deployment.apps/cloud-trace-demo-c is created
service/cloud-trace-demo-c is created
Wait for load balancer initialization complete......
Completed.
Create trace data
A trace describes the time it takes an application to complete a
single operation.
To create a trace, in the Cloud Shell, run the following command:
curl $( kubectl get svc -o = jsonpath = '{.items[?(@.metadata.name=="cloud-trace-demo-a")].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' )
The response of the previous command looks like the following:
Hello, I am service A
And I am service B
Hello, I am service C
You can execute the curl command multiple times to generate multiple
traces.
View latency data
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Trace explorer page:
Go to Trace explorer
You can also find this page by using the search bar.
The following screenshot shows the result of running the curl command
several times. The graph displays aggregated latency data for spans , which
describe trace sub-operations.
Note: If you don't see any trace data after waiting a few minutes, then there
might be a permission problem. To resolve this problem, check to see whether
the service account with the extension
@developer.gserviceaccount.com has the Editor
role. If not, then grant the service account
the Cloud Trace Agent
role, and run the curl command.
To view a trace in detail, select a span in the graph or a row in the table.
The trace details dialog opens, as shown in the following screenshot:
A Gantt chart displays information about the selected trace. The first
row in the Gantt chart is for the trace, and each following row is a span
within the trace.
To view information detailed information about a span, in the Gantt chart,
select the span.
About the application
The sample application used in this quickstart is available in a GitHub
repository. This repository contains information on how to use the application
in environments other than the Cloud Shell.
The sample application is written in Python, uses the Flask framework and
OpenTelemetry packages, and executes on a GKE cluster.
This guide creates a standard GKE cluster. If you use
Autopilot mode for Google Kubernetes Engine or if you enable
Workload Identity Federation for GKE, then you must
configure your application to use Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
Instrumentation
The file app.py in the GitHub repository ,
contains the instrumentation necessary to capture and send trace
data to your Google Cloud project:
The application imports several OpenTelemetry packages:
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.cloud_trace import CloudTraceSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.propagate import set_global_textmap
from opentelemetry.propagators.cloud_trace_propagator import CloudTraceFormatPropagator
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
The application instruments web requests with trace context and automatically
traces Flask handlers and requests to other services:
app = flask . Flask ( __name__ )
FlaskInstrumentor () . instrument_app ( app )
RequestsInstrumentor () . instrument ()
The application configures the Cloud Trace exporter as a trace provider,
which propagates trace context in the Cloud Trace format:
def configure_exporter ( exporter ):
"""Configures OpenTelemetry context propagation to use Cloud Trace context
Args:
exporter: exporter instance to be configured in the OpenTelemetry tracer provider
"""
set_global_textmap ( CloudTraceFormatPropagator ())
tracer_provider = TracerProvider ()
tracer_provider . add_span_processor ( BatchSpanProcessor ( exporter ))
trace . set_tracer_provider ( tracer_provider )
configure_exporter ( CloudTraceSpanExporter ())
tracer = trace . get_tracer ( __name__ )
The following code snippet shows how to send requests in Python.
OpenTelemetry implicitly propagates the trace context for you with your
outgoing requests:
if endpoint is not None and endpoint != "" :
data = { "body" : keyword }
response = requests . get (
endpoint ,
params = data ,
)
return keyword + " \n " + response . text
else :
return keyword , 200
How the application works
For clarity, in this section, cloud-trace-demo is omitted from the service
names. For example, the service cloud-trace-demo-c is referenced as c .
This application creates three services named a , b , and c . Service a is
configured to call service b , service b is configured to call service c .
For details on the configuration of the services, see the YAML files in the
GitHub repository .
When you issued a HTTP request to service a in this quickstart,
you used the following curl command:
curl $(kubectl get svc -o=jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.name=="cloud-trace-demo-a")].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
The curl command works as follows:
kubectl fetches the IP address of the service named cloud-trace-demo-a .
The curl command then sends the HTTP request to service a .
Service a receives the HTTP request and sends a request to service b .
Service b receives the HTTP request and sends a request to service c .
Service c receives the HTTP request from service b and returns the
string Hello, I am service C to service b .
Service b receives the response from service c , appends it to the
string And I am service B , and returns the result to service a .
Service a receives the response from service b and appends it to the
string Hello, I am service A .
The response from service a is printed in the Cloud Shell.
Clean up
