Find and explore traces
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
To view an aggregate representation of your trace data, or to find and explore
individual traces or traces that contain specific labels, use the
Trace Explorer page.
The following screenshot illustrates how trace data is shown:
To run queries that perform an aggregate analysis of your spans, use the
Observability Analytics page or BigQuery. Both interfaces support querying
your span data by using SQL. When you use the Observability Analytics page, you can
view query results as a table or as a chart. To learn more about using
SQL to query your trace data, see
Query and analyze traces .
This feature is supported only for Google Cloud projects.
For App Hub
configurations, select the App Hub host project or management project.
About the Trace Explorer page
To help you identify trends and patterns in your trace data, the latency data
is aggregated and displayed in charts. The heatmap uses color to represent
the number of spans in a cell. A cell with many spans has a darker color than
one with few spans. Each cell's tooltip displays latency and other information.
You can also view latency percentiles and span rate information.
When you are investigating an issue, you might want to view a specific trace
or only spans with certain properties:
To restrict which spans are shown, apply filters . For
example, you can filter by service, application, error state, and other
properties.
To display a specific trace, use the toolbar's
click pageview Search for trace option.
To identify outliers and view details of individual spans, use the tabular
section:
You can sort the rows of the Spans and Grouped tabs by the duration
header.
To understand how many spans different services are generating, use the
Grouped tab. Each row corresponds to a service and span name, and
for each entry, latency statistics are shown.
To explore details of a span or grouping, select the entry from a row in the
tabular section. A flyout opens that displays the span in the context of its
trace. From this view, you can explore the span, its attributes, and view events
and log data. You also can
search the spans and attributes in the trace for keywords .
The trace data that the Trace Explorer page depends on the
following:
The Scope setting, which determines which views the system searches for
trace data. When the page opens, the Scope element is set to the default
trace scope and system queries the views listed in
that scope for trace data.
On a new project, the default trace scope lists the _AllSpans
for the project. That view provides read access to all trace data that
the project stores.
Your Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions on the searched view.
If you don't have the permission to view trace data for a project, then
the Google Cloud console displays a warning message and the data from that
project isn't displayed.
The time-range setting.
The filters you apply.
The remainder of this page provides more information about how to find and
explore your trace data.
Before you begin
To get the permissions that
you need to view trace data by using the Google Cloud console and to or select a trace scope,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Cloud Trace User ( roles/cloudtrace.user )
IAM role on your project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to view trace data by using the Google Cloud console and to or select a trace scope. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to view trace data by using the Google Cloud console and to or select a trace scope:
To select a trace scope:
cloudtrace.traceScopes.[get, list]
To read the default trace scope:
observability.scopes.get
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
For more information about roles, see
Control access with Identity and Access Management .
View aggregated trace data
To view the aggregated information about your trace data, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Trace explorer page:
Go to Trace explorer
You can also find this page by using the search bar.
It might take several minutes after the
first trace data is written
to a Google Cloud project before that data is available to view.
If you don't see any trace data displayed after waiting a few minutes, then
your project might not have any data to display or there might be a
configuration issue. For information about how to resolve these issues, see
Troubleshoot: No data in the Trace interface .
Configure the Trace Explorer page:
In the toolbar of the Google Cloud console,
select your Google Cloud project. For App Hub
configurations, select the App Hub host project or management project.
Optional: Configure
which views the system searches for trace data by using the Scope
element:
To show the trace data that your project stores, set the
first menu of the Scope element to
Project or to _Default .
These two settings are equivalent.
To show the trace data that multiple projects store, expand the
first menu of the Scope element, select
Trace scope , and then select the trace scope that lists
the _AllSpans view for those projects.
After you make your selection, the Scope menu displays
a trace scope icon, , and the name of the
selected trace scope.
The data that the system displays depends on your
IAM roles on the searched views. For example, if you don't
have the permissions necessary to see data in a view,
then the system doesn't display that data.
For more information, see
Create and manage trace scopes .
Optional: Update the time range by using the time-range selector or by
using your pointer to highlight a range on the x-axis.
For example, you might set this selector to Last 2 weeks when you want
to see whether there are any trends in the latency data.
Span data is stored for 30 days.
Explore the heatmap:
Use color to identify trends and outliers. A cell with many spans has a
darker color than one with few spans.
View details of the cell by using the cell's tooltip. The tooltip lists
number of spans, date and time, and the time interval of the cell.
Note: If you select a cell in the heatmap, then the table that lists
individual spans or groupings of spans is updated.
Explore latency percentiles and error rates:
To view latency trends, set the Chart view menu to
Span duration (percentile) .
The duration chart displays the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles.
To view the response status as a function of time,
set the Chart view menu to Span rate . The chart displays the
rate of spans being sent to your project.
Use the Spans and Grouped tables to identify outliers or to view
statistical information. The Spans table lists individual spans. The
Grouped table groups spans by their name and by service or workload name.
To view outliers or find a span name, sort the table. You can sort by
any column header.
For example, sorting the Spans table by duration lets you find
spans with high latency.
To view statistics like average latency, use the Grouped table.
To find App Hub-registered services and workloads, search
the Service/workload column for entries that include the
service icon, , or the
workload icon, .
The link provided with an App Hub-registered
service or workload opens the corresponding Application Monitoring dashboard.
If you want more information about a particular grouping, then select the
span name for a row. A flyout opens that displays the span in the context of
its trace. You can then explore the span and trace .
To restrict which spans are shown, add filters.
To learn more about filtering your trace data, see the next section.
Filter your trace data
To display only information that is of interest to you, apply filters.
Filters restrict what data is shown. For example, you might
filter by service name and by status. Or, if you've deployed applications
to App Hub , you might want to view the trace data
only for the application, or for a specific service or workload that is part
of the application.
When you add or remove a filter, the data displayed by the
Trace Explorer page is refreshed and
only shows those spans that match all applied filters.
Filter by a trace by ID
When you are troubleshooting an incident or failure, you might know the
trace ID. To explore that trace, go to the toolbar,
click pageview Search for trace ,
and enter the trace ID .
When you enter a valid ID, the Details flyout opens and displays
information about the trace and its spans. You can use the options in that
pane to explore the trace. For example, you might
search the spans for keywords .
Note: If you enter a trace ID that isn't found, then the trace data might be
stored in a view that isn't searched by the
Trace Explorer page,
or you might not have an IAM role that lets you
view trace data. To resolve these failures, identify the projects that
store the trace data. For each project, verify that your
IAM role lets you view trace data and then ensure that the
Scope element lists the project's default view for trace data.
For more information, see
Configure which views the Trace Explorer searches .
Apply span filters
The Span filters pane lists the most common filters. You can select
multiple entries from any subcategory. As you add or remove filters,
the Filter bar is also updated.
The values for all menus are derived from your trace data. When a menu includes
an option without any text, that option refers to spans that don't
include the corresponding attribute.
The following Span filters are typically available:
OpenTelemetry service : Filters by the service.name attribute.
Span name : Name of the span.
Span status : The request status. For information about the values,
see the OpenTelemetry SpanStatus documentation .
Duration : The duration of the span.
Span kind : Describes the relationships between spans. For information
about the values, see the OpenTelemetry SpanKind documentation .
App Hub application : Filters by the gcp.apphub.application.id
resource attribute.
App Hub service : Filters by the gcp.apphub.service.id
resource attribute.
App Hub workload : Filters by the gcp.apphub.workload.id
resource attribute.
If you want to filter by an attribute that isn't listed in the
Span filters pane, then use the Filter bar.
Use the filter bar
The Filter bar lets you apply a filter with a predefined filter key and
a value that you select, or you can enter both the key and value.
To add a filter, select Add filter , and then do one of the following:
Select a defined key, like Span name , and then select a value from
the secondary menu.
Select Add attribute filter , and then add your custom key and value.
If you enter your own filter key, then use the same syntax as a key for an
attribute on a span.
For example, to filter by the host identifier, set the key to host.id .
Similarly, to filter by status code, set the key to /http/status_code .
In this scenario, you might set the value to 200 , which results in the
filter /http/status_code: 200 .
To let the filter match any value, select Any value .
Filter by application
To find or view spans your App Hub -registered services and
workloads generate, your spans must contain the following resource attributes:
gcp.apphub.application.{container,id,location}
gcp.apphub.{workload,service}.{criticality_type,environment_type,id}
The previous resource attributes are generated by
instrumentation that you add to your applications .
You can filter your trace data by any resource attribute.
However, the following Span filters filter by the application, service,
and workload IDs:
App Hub application
App Hub service
App Hub workload
To open the Application Monitoring dashboard for a
App Hub-registered service and workload, do the following:
Go to the Spans or Grouped table and find the service or
workload. You might look for the service icon, ,
the workload icon, , or filter the table.
Select the link in the Service/workload column.
Explore a trace
This section provides information about how you can explore a span in the
context of its trace:
Open and configure the Trace Explorer page. For information
about these steps, see View aggregated trace data .
To view details of a span or a trace, do one of the following:
Go to the table section of the Trace Explorer page and
select an entry from the tabular section. You can sort the rows of the
tables by any table header. You can apply filters to
restrict which spans the tables show.
Go to the toolbar of the Trace Explorer page,
click pageview Search for trace ,
and enter the trace ID .
The Details flyout opens and displays a trace and its spans.
The details for the span or trace you selected are shown:
The Name column displays the call hierarchy and the first entry
includes the trace ID. This column might also include annotations that
indicate whether generative AI events or log data is available.
The Service/workload column displays a service or workload name.
Service names are extracted from the
OpenTelemetry attribute service.name , when that attribute is set.
If that attribute isn't set and if the service is running on
App Engine, then the App Engine service name is
displayed. Otherwise, no service is specified.
The length of the latency bar is representative of the latency value.
The color of the latency bar indicates status. A blue latency bar indicates
a successful completion while a red latency bar indicates an error occurred.
A circle on a latency bar indicates a log entry or event is associated with
the span. To change this behavior, use the Logs & events menu.
To explore the trace, do the following:
Use your pointer to select different spans. When you select a span, the
tabs on the page are refreshed to show the span's
attributes, log entries, and events .
To search the spans in the trace for keywords,
use the Find in Trace field.
Search applies only to the span name, service or workload name,
and attributes fields.
You can only search by plain text, and you can't search logs, events, or
metadata.
For example, if you enter GET , then text in the Name ,
Service/workload , and Attributes panes that displays GET ,
ignoring case, is highlighted.
View attributes, log entries, and events
The Details flyout for a span contains a tab for each of the following:
Attributes : This tab lists labels that are attached to spans.
For information about labels, see Trace labels .
Logs & Events : This tab lists events and log entries whose
trace_id and span_id fields match the selected span are shown. Only
log entries that you have permission to view are shown.
To explore an entry on this tab,
click keyboard_arrow_down Show more .
If you prefer to use the Logs Explorer page to view log data, then
click View logs . The query is set to filter to a specific trace, span,
and time range.
Note: Generative AI events are shown on the Inputs/Outputs
tab. To learn more, see View generative AI events .
Stacktraces : Lists the available stacktraces.
Metadata & Links : Lists general information about the span:
Span ID: The span ID is a 64-bit integer other than 0. For details, see
TraceSpan .
Parent span ID.
Project ID.
Start time and end time.
Table that lists links to other spans. For each link, this table lists
the following:
The key-value pairs for the linked-to span.
The trace ID for the linked-to-span. When this field lists
Current trace , then the span is linking to another span in the
same trace.
For information about links, see the
Links API reference page.
The Details might also include a tab labeled
Inputs/Outputs tab. This tab displays generative AI events.
View generative AI events
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
To view events related to generative AI agents, use the
Inputs/Outputs tab. This tab displays events that follow
the OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions .
There are two supported configurations:
Text-based prompts and responses that are attached to the spans as
attributes , which are key-value pairs that describe some
characteristic or an event. For example, the value for the key
gen_ai.system identifies the system that provides the generative AI
capabilities. The keys for generative AI attributes begin with gen_ai .
Multimodal prompts and responses that are stored in a
Cloud Storage bucket. Cloud Trace identifies these events by
correlating your trace and log data. To learn about supported
configurations, see
Collect and view multimodal prompts and responses .
The following screenshot illustrates how the Trace Explorer
page renders text-based generative AI events that are attached to the spans:
To learn about the sample application that generated the previous screenshot,
see Instrument a LangGraph ReAct Agent with OpenTelemetry .
View calls to remote MCP servers
To view spans written by MCP servers, filter your trace data by the span
name. For example, some remote Google Cloud MCP servers can generate a trace span when
they receive a
tools/call operation. These spans have the following naming convention:
tools/call NAME
In the previous expression, NAME refers to the invoked endpoint.
For example, this might be something similar to list_keys . This naming
convention is defined by the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for MCP .
To find these spans, [use the filter bar][filter-trace] and add an
attribute filter for mcp.method.name . Set the value of the filter to
tools/call .
To learn about which remote Google Cloud MCP servers support trace generation and how to
configure your application to instruct these servers to generate spans, see
Investigate MCP calls using Trace .
