BatchWriteSpansRequest
The request message for the BatchWriteSpans method.
Module
Binary module.
Span
A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans
can be nested to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a
root span that describes the end-to-end latency, and one or more
subspans for its sub-operations.
A trace can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all.
Spans do not need to be contiguous. There might be
gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.
StackTrace
A call stack appearing in a trace.
TruncatableString
Represents a string that might be shortened to a specified
length.
