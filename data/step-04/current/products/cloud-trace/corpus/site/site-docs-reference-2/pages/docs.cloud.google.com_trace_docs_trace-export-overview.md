Caution : As of
February 18, 2026, the export of span data to BigQuery by using Cloud Trace
sinks is deprecated . Sinks used to export spans to
BigQuery will be removed on or after February 18, 2027. For information about
how to view your span data in BigQuery, see
Migrate to Observability Analytics .

This product or feature is

of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This page provides a conceptual overview of exporting trace data
using Cloud Trace. You might want to export trace data for the following
reasons:
To store trace data for a period longer than the
default retention period of 30 days.
To let you use BigQuery tools to analyze your trace data. For
example, using BigQuery, you can identify span counts and
quantiles. For information on the query used to generate the following
table, see HipsterShop query .
Note: Only trace spans ingested through the Cloud Trace API are eligible for
export. Trace spans emitted by Google Cloud services or ingested through the
Telemetry API are unsupported.
How exports work
Exporting involves creating a sink for a Google Cloud project.
A sink defines a BigQuery dataset as the destination.
You can create a sink by using the Cloud Trace API or by using the
Google Cloud CLI.
Sink properties and terminology
Sinks are defined for a Google Cloud project and have the following
properties:
Name : A name for the sink. For example, a name might be:
"projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /traceSinks/my-sink"
where PROJECT_NUMBER is the sink's Google Cloud project number
and my-sink is the sink identifier.
Parent : The resource in which you create the sink. The parent must be
a Google Cloud project:
"projects/ PROJECT_ID "
The PROJECT_ID can either be a Google Cloud project identifier or
number.
Destination : A single place to send trace spans.
Trace supports exporting traces to BigQuery.
The destination can be sink's Google Cloud project or
any other Google Cloud project that is in the same organization.
For example, a valid destination is:
bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/ DESTINATION_PROJECT_NUMBER /datasets/ DATASET_ID
where DESTINATION_PROJECT_NUMBER is the
Google Cloud project number of the destination, and
DATASET_ID is the BigQuery dataset identifier.
Writer Identity : A service account name. The export destination's owner
must give this service account permissions to write to the export
destination. When exporting traces, Trace adopts this
identity for authorization. For increased security, new sinks get a unique
service account:
export- PROJECT_NUMBER - GENERATED_VALUE @gcp-sa-cloud-trace.iam.gserviceaccount.com
where PROJECT_NUMBER is your Google Cloud project number, in Hex,
and GENERATED_VALUE is a randomly generated value.
You don't create, own, or manage the service account that is identified by
the writer identity of a sink. When you create a sink,
Trace creates the service account that the sink requires.
This service account isn't included in the list of service accounts for
your project until it has at least one Identity and Access Management binding. You add this
binding when you configure a sink destination.
For information on using the writer identity, see
destination permissions .
How sinks work
Every time a trace span arrives in a project, Trace
exports a copy of the span.
Traces that Trace received before the sink was created
cannot be exported.
Access control
To create or modify a sink, you must have one of the following Identity and Access Management
roles:
Trace Admin
Trace User
Project Owner
Project Editor
For more information, see Access control .
To export traces to a destination, the sink's writer service account
must be permitted to write to the destination. For more information about writer
identities, see Sink properties on this page.
Quotas and limits
Cloud Trace utilizes the
BigQuery streaming API
to send trace spans to the destination. Cloud Trace batches API calls.
Cloud Trace doesn't implement a retry or throttling mechanism. Trace spans
might not be exported successfully if the amount of data exceeds the
destination quotas.
For details on BigQuery quotas and limits, see
Quotas and limits .
Pricing
Exporting traces doesn't incur Cloud Trace charges. However, you might
incur BigQuery charges.
See BigQuery pricing for more information.
Estimating your costs
BigQuery charges for data ingestion and storage. To estimate
your monthly BigQuery costs, do the following:
Estimate the total number of trace spans that are ingested in a month.
For information about how to view usage, see
View usage by billing account .
Estimate the streaming requirements based on the number of trace spans
ingested.
Each span is written to a table row. Each row in BigQuery requires
at least 1024 bytes. Therefore, a lower bound on your
BigQuery streaming requirements is to
assign 1024 bytes to each span. For example, if your Google Cloud
project ingested 200 spans, then those spans require at least
20,400 bytes for the streaming insert.
Use the Pricing calculator to estimate your
BigQuery costs due to storage, streaming inserts, and queries.
Viewing and managing your BigQuery usage
You can use Metrics Explorer to view your BigQuery usage. You can
also create an alerting policy that notifies you if your BigQuery
usage exceeds predefined limits. The following table contains the settings
to create an alerting policy. You can use the settings in the target pane
table when creating a chart or when using
Metrics Explorer .
To create an alerting policy that triggers when the ingested
BigQuery metrics exceed a user-defined
level, use the following settings.
Steps to create an alerting policy .
To create an alerting policy, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
notifications Alerting page:
Go to Alerting
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
If you haven't created your notification channels and if you want to be notified, then click
Edit Notification Channels and add your notification channels. Return to the
Alerting page after you add your channels.
From the Alerting page, select Create policy .
To select the resource, metric, and filters, expand the Select a metric menu and
then use the values in the New condition table:
Optional: To limit the menu to relevant entries, enter the resource or
metric name in the filter bar.
Select a Resource type . For example, select VM instance .
Select a Metric category . For example, select instance .
Select a Metric . For example, select CPU Utilization .
Select Apply .
Click Next and then configure the alerting policy trigger.
To complete these fields, use the values in the Configure alert trigger table.
Click Next .
Optional: To add notifications to your alerting policy, click
Notification channels . In the dialog, select one or more notification
channels from the menu, and then click OK .
To be notified when incidents are openend and closed, check
Notify on incident closure . By default, notifications are sent only when
incidents are openend.
Optional: Update the Incident autoclose duration . This field determines when
Monitoring closes incidents in the absence of metric data.
Optional: Click Documentation , and then add any information that you
want included in a notification message.
Click Alert name and enter a name for the alerting policy.
Click Create Policy .
