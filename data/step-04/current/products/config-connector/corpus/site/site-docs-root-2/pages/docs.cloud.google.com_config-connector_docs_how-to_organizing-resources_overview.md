Organizing your resources
Overview
Config Connector can create and manage Google Cloud resources at the project-level, folder-level,
or organization-level scope. Config Connector needs to determine:
Whether to create the resource at the project-level, folder-level, or organization-level.
Which project, folder, or organization to use.
As a result, Config Connector first checks for a scope-defining
field in your resource spec, if not found, then checks for a scope-defining
annotation. Most Google Cloud resources can be created at only the
project-level.
Once a resource is successfully created, regardless of how the scope is
set, the field or annotation becomes immutable. To change the
scope of a resource, you must delete the current resource and create a
new resource in a different project, folder, or organization scope.
Scope-defining field
A scope-defining resource spec field is part of the resource's spec and can
be set only in the resource's configuration. It follows the naming convention of
SCOPE Ref. Depending on the resource type,
the schema of the spec may contain at least one of the following fields:
projectRef
folderRef
organizationRef
Scope-defining annotation
You can define a scope-defining annotation in the resource's configuration
or in the Kubernetes namespace which contains the resource. There are three types of scope-defining annotations depending on the resource type:
cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id
cnrm.cloud.google.com/folder-id
cnrm.cloud.google.com/organization-id
Most Config Connector resources support scope-defining fields. We recommend
fields over scope-defining annotations because a scope-defining field makes the
resource spec more self-contained and enables the creation of a scope and its
contained resources in one step. For resources that do not support
scope-defining fields, you can either supply
the scope-defining annotation in their configuration, or default the
annotation for all resources in a particular namespace by annotating the
namespace. The namespace annotation is ignored if the resource has the
scope-defining annotation directly in its configuration.
Warning: Using the namespace annotation is a convenient way to specify default
scope for all resources under the same namespace, but it may cause performance
issues when managing a large number of resources under one Kubernetes namespace.
Exceptions
If the scope concept does not apply to a Config Connector resource, you do not need to specify a project, folder, or organization scope.
Specifically if a resource listed in the
resource reference page does not have a scope-defining field or a scope-defining annotation,
you do not need to add a scope.
Some resources, like BillingBudgetsBudget
are bound to a Google Cloud billing account, and requires you to specify
the billing account information instead.
IAM resources, including IAMPolicy ,
IAMPartialPolicy ,
IAMPolicyMember
and IAMAuditConfig do not require you to provide a scope.
Instead, these resources are attached to another Google Cloud resource through the spec.resourceRef
field. This other Google Cloud resource can be a PubSubTopic , a SpannerInstance
or even a "scope" like project, folder, organization, which are themselves modeled as a Google Cloud resource.
