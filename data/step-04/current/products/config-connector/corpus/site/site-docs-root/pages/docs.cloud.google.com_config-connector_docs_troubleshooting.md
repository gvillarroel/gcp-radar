Troubleshoot Config Connector
This page describes troubleshooting techniques that you can use to troubleshoot
Config Connector and common issues that you might encounter when using
the product.
Check Config Connector status and conditions
Check the version of Config Connector
Run the following command to get the installed Config Connector version, and cross-reference
the release notes to verify that
the running version supports the features and resources that you want to use:
kubectl get ns cnrm-system -o jsonpath = '{.metadata.annotations.cnrm\.cloud\.google\.com/version}'
Check the resource's status and events
Usually, you can determine the issue with your Config Connector resources by
inspecting the state of your resources in
Kubernetes . Checking
a resource's status and events is particularly helpful for determining if
Config Connector failed to reconcile the resource and why the reconciliation
failed.
Check that Config Connector is running
To check that Config Connector is running, verify that all of its Pods are
READY :
kubectl get pod -n cnrm-system
Example output:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
cnrm-controller-manager-0 1/1 Running 0 1h
cnrm-deletiondefender-0 1/1 Running 0 1h
cnrm-resource-stats-recorder-77dc8cc4b6-mgpgp 1/1 Running 0 1h
cnrm-webhook-manager-58496b66f9-pqwhz 1/1 Running 0 1h
cnrm-webhook-manager-58496b66f9-wdcn4 1/1 Running 0 1h
If you have Config Connector installed in
namespaced-mode ,
then you will have one controller ( cnrm-controller-manager ) Pod for each
namespace that is responsible for managing the Config Connector resources in
that namespace.
You can check the status of the controller Pod responsible for a specific
namespace by running:
kubectl get pod -n cnrm-system \
-l cnrm.cloud.google.com/scoped-namespace = NAMESPACE \
-l cnrm.cloud.google.com/component = cnrm-controller-manager
Replace NAMESPACE with the name of the namespace.
Check the controller logs
The controller Pod logs information and errors related to the reconciliation of
Config Connector resources.
You can check the controller Pod's logs by running:
kubectl logs -n cnrm-system \
-l cnrm.cloud.google.com/component = cnrm-controller-manager \
-c manager
If you have Config Connector installed in
namespaced-mode ,
then the previous command shows the logs of all controller Pods combined. You
can check the logs of the controller Pod for a specific namespace by running:
kubectl logs -n cnrm-system \
-l cnrm.cloud.google.com/scoped-namespace = NAMESPACE \
-l cnrm.cloud.google.com/component = cnrm-controller-manager \
-c manager
Replace NAMESPACE with the name of the namespace.
Read more about how to inspect and query Config Connector's logs .
Abandon and acquire the resource
In some cases, you might need to update an immutable field in a resource. Since
you can't edit immutable fields, you must abandon and then acquire the resource:
Update the YAML configuration of the Config Connector resource and set
the cnrm.cloud.google.com/deletion-policy annotation to
abandon .
Apply the updated YAML configuration to update the Config Connector
resource's deletion policy.
Abandon the Config Connector
resource .
Update the immutable fields that need to be changed in the YAML
configuration.
Apply the updated YAML configuration to
acquire the abandoned
resource .

Reconciliation
The following section lists common issues related to reconciliation of resources
by Config Connector.
Resource keeps updating every 5-15 mins
Symptom
Your Config Connector resource keeps switching from an UpToDate status to
an Updating status every 5-10 minutes.
Cause
It is likely that Config Connector is detecting unintentional diffs between the resource's
desired state and actual state, thereby causing Config Connector to constantly
update the resource.
Resolution
First, confirm that you do not have any external systems that are constantly
modifying either the Config Connector or Google Cloud resource (for
example, CI/CD pipelines, custom controllers, cron jobs, etc.).
If the behavior is not due to an external system, see if Google Cloud is
changing any of the values specified in your Config Connector resource. For
example, in some cases, Google Cloud changes the formatting (for example,
capitalization) of field values which leads to a diff between your resource's
desired state and actual state.
Get the state of the Google Cloud resource using the REST API (for
example, for
ContainerCluster )
or the Google Cloud CLI. Then, compare that state against your Config Connector
resource. Look for any fields whose values do not match, then update your
Config Connector resource to match. In particular, look for any values that
were reformatted by Google Cloud. For example, see GitHub issues
#578
and
#294 .
Note that this is not a perfect method since the Config Connector and
Google Cloud resource models are different, but it should let you catch
most cases of unintended diffs.
If you are unable to resolve your issue, see Additional
help .
Resource has no status
Symptom
Your resources don't have a status field.
Cause
It is likely that Config Connector is not running properly.
Resolution
Check that Config Connector is running .
KNV2005: syncer excessively updating resource
Symptom
You use
Config Sync and
are seeing KNV2005
errors for
Config Connector resources, similar to the following:
KNV2005: detected excessive object updates, approximately 6 times per
minute. This may indicate Config Sync is fighting with another controller over
the object.
Cause
It is likely that Config Sync and Config Connector are fighting over the resource.
Config Sync and Config Connector are said to be "fighting" over a resource
if they keep updating the same field(s) to different values. One's update
triggers the other to act and update the resource, which causes the other to
act and update the resource, and this repeats without ending.
Fighting is not a problem for most fields. Fields that are specified in
Config Sync are not changed by Config Connector. Similarly, fields that are not
specified in Config Sync and defaulted by Config Connector are ignored by
Config Sync. Therefore, for most fields, Config Sync and
Config Connector shouldn't need to update the same field.
One exception is list fields. Similar to how Config Connector may
default subfields in object fields, Config Connector may also default subfields
in objects inside lists. However, since list fields in Config Connector
resources are atomic, the defaulting of subfields is considered as changing the
value of the list entirely.
Therefore, Config Sync and Config Connector will "fight" over a resource if
Config Sync sets a list field and Config Connector defaults any subfields
within that list.
Resolution
To work around this issue, you have the following options:
Update the resource manifest in the Config Sync repository to match what
Config Connector is trying to set the resource to.
One way to do this is to temporarily stop syncing
configs ,
wait for Config Connector to finish reconciling the resource, and then
update your resource manifest to match the resource on the Kubernetes API
Server.
Stop Config Sync from reacting to updates to the resource on the
Kubernetes API Server by setting the annotation
client.lifecycle.config.k8s.io/mutation to ignore . Read more about how
to have Config Sync ignore object
mutations .
Stop Config Connector from updating the resource's spec entirely by setting
the annotation cnrm.cloud.google.com/state-into-spec to absent on the
resource. This annotation is not supported for all resources. To see if your
resource supports the annotation, check the corresponding
resource reference page .
Read more about the annotation .
Resource deleted by Config Connector
Symptom
A resource was deleted from your cluster, and you suspect Config Connector deleted it.
Cause
Config Connector never deletes your resources without an external cause.
For example, running kubectl delete , using config management tools like
Argo CD, or using a customized API client can cause resource deletion.
A common misconception is that Config Connector has initiated and deleted some of the
resources in your cluster. For example, if you are using Config Connector, you
may notice delete requests from Config Connector controller manager against
certain resources from either container log messages or Kubernetes cluster
audit logs. These delete requests are a result of external triggers and
Config Connector is trying to reconcile the delete requests.
Resolution
To determine why a resource was deleted, you need to look into
the first delete request that was sent to the corresponding resource. The
best way to look into this is by examining the Kubernetes cluster audit logs.
As an example, if you are using GKE, you can
use Cloud Logging to query for
GKE cluster audit logs. For example, if you want to look
for the initial delete requests for a BigQueryDataset resource named foo in
namespace bar , you would run a query like the following:
resource . type = "k8s_cluster"
resource . labels . project_id = "my-project-id"
resource . labels . cluster_name = "my-cluster-name"
protoPayload . methodName = "com.google.cloud.cnrm.bigquery.v1beta1.bigquerydatasets.delete"
protoPayload . resourceName = "bigquery.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1/namespaces/bar/bigquerydatasets/foo"
Using this query, you would look for the first delete request and then check
authenticationInfo.principalEmail of that delete log message to determine the
cause of the deletion.
Controller Pod OOMKilled
Symptom
You see an OOMKilled error on a Config Connector controller Pod. The Pod's status may appear as OOMKilled or Terminating .
Cause
A container or the entire Pod was terminated because they used more memory than allowed.
This can be verified by running the kubectl describe command:
kubectl describe pod POD_NAME -n cnrm-system
Replace POD_NAME with the Pod you are troubleshooting.
Additionally, scrutinizing the Pod's event logs can reveal any occurrences of OOM-related events.
Resolution
To address this issue, you can use the ControllerResource custom resource to increase the memory request and the memory
limit for the Pod.
Deletion
The following section lists common issues related to user-initiated delete
operations that can cause conflicts with Config Connector.
Namespace deletion stuck at "Terminating"
Symptom
Deleting a namespace is stuck at the Terminating stage.
Cause
This issue can happen if you have Config Connector installed in
namespaced-mode
and if the namespace's ConfigConnectorContext was deleted before all
Config Connector resources in that namespace are deleted. When a namespace's
ConfigConnectorContext is deleted, Config Connector is disabled for that
namespace, which prevents any remaining Config Connector resources in that
namespace from getting deleted.
Resolution
To fix this issue, you must do a forced cleanup and then
manually delete the underlying Google Cloud resources afterwards.
To mitigate this issue in the future, only delete the ConfigConnectorContext
after all Config Connector resources in its namespace have been deleted from
Kubernetes. Avoid deleting entire namespaces before all Config Connector
resources in that namespace have been deleted since the
ConfigConnectorContext might get deleted first.
Resource deletion stuck at "DeleteFailed" after project was deleted
Symptom
Deleting a Config Connector resource fails with the DeleteFailed status.
Cause
This issue can happen if a Google Cloud project is deleted before the
resource.
Resolution
To fix this issue, restore the project on
Google Cloud
to allow Config Connector to delete the remaining child resources from Kubernetes.
Alternatively, you can do a forced cleanup .
To mitigate this issue in the future, only delete Google Cloud projects
after all their child Config Connector resources have been deleted from
Kubernetes. Avoid deleting entire namespaces that might contain both a
Project resource and its child Config Connector resources since the Project
resource might get deleted first.
Permissions and authentication
The following section lists common issues related to permissions and authentication.
Compute Engine metadata not defined
Symptom
Your Config Connector resource has an UpdateFailed status with a message
stating that the Compute Engine metadata is not defined, similar to
the following error:
Update call failed: error fetching live state: error reading underlying
resource: summary: Error when reading or editing SpannerInstance
"my-project/my-spanner- instance": Get

Cause
It is likely that the IAM service account used by Config Connector does not exist.
Resolution
To fix the issue, ensure that the IAM service account used by
Config Connector exists.
To mitigate this issue in the future, ensure that you follow the
Config Connector installation
instructions .
Error 403: Request had insufficient authentication scopes
Symptom
Your Config Connector resource has an UpdateFailed status with a message
indicating a 403 error due to insufficient authentication scopes, similar
to the following error:
Update call failed: error fetching live state: error reading underlying
resource: summary: Error when reading or editing SpannerInstance
"my-project/my-spanner-instance": googleapi: Error 403: Request had
insufficient authentication scopes.
Cause
Workload Identity Federation for GKE is likely not enabled on
your GKE cluster.
To confirm that Workload Identity Federation for GKE is not enabled, complete the following steps:
Save the following Pod configuration as wi-test.yaml :
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
metadata :
name : workload-identity-test
namespace : cnrm-system
spec :
containers :
- image : google/cloud-sdk:slim
name : workload-identity-test
command : [ "sleep" , "infinity" ]
serviceAccountName : cnrm-controller-manager
If you installed Config Connector using
namespaced mode ,
serviceAccountName should be cnrm-controller-manager- NAMESPACE .
Replace NAMESPACE with namespace you used during the
installation.
Create the Pod in your GKE cluster:
kubectl apply -f wi-test.yaml
Open an interactive session in the Pod:
kubectl exec -it workload-identity-test \
--namespace cnrm-system \
-- /bin/bash
List your identity:
gcloud auth list
Verify that the identity listed matches the Google service account bound
to your resources.
If you see the Compute Engine default service account
instead, then that means that Workload Identity Federation for GKE is not enabled on your
GKE cluster and/or node pool.
Exit the interactive session, then delete the Pod from your
GKE cluster:
kubectl delete pod workload-identity-test \
--namespace cnrm-system
Resolution
To fix this issue, ensure that Workload Identity Federation for GKE is enabled
on your cluster.
If you're still seeing the same error, ensure that you have also
enabled Workload Identity Federation for GKE on the cluster's node pools .
403 Forbidden: The caller does not have permission
Symptom
Your Config Connector resource has an UpdateFailed status with a message
indicating a 403 error due to Workload Identity Federation for GKE,
similar to the following error:
Update call failed: error fetching live state: error reading underlying
resource: summary: Error when reading or editing SpannerInstance
"my-project/my-spanner- instance": Get
"https://spanner.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project/instances/my-spanner-instance?alt=json":
compute: Received 403 `Unable to generate access token; IAM returned 403
Forbidden: The caller does not have permission
This error could be caused by a missing IAM policy binding on the target IAM
service account.
For more information, refer to the Workload Identity documentation:
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#creating_a_relationship_between_ksas_and_gsas
Cause
Config Connector's Kubernetes service account is missing the appropriate
IAM permissions to impersonate your IAM service
account as a Workload Identity Federation for GKE user.
Resolution
To fix and mitigate the issue in the future, refer to the Config Connector
installation instructions .
Error 403: Caller is missing IAM permission
Symptom
Your Config Connector resource has an UpdateFailed status with a message
stating that the caller is missing an IAM permission,
similar to the following error:
Update call failed: error fetching live state: error reading underlying
resource: summary: Error when reading or editing SpannerInstance
"my-project/my-spanner- instance": googleapi: Error 403: Caller is missing IAM
permission spanner.instances.get on resource
projects/my-project/instances/my-spanner-instance., detail:
Cause
The IAM service account used by Config Connector is missing the
IAM permission stated in the message that is needed to manage
the Google Cloud resource.
Resolution
If you're still seeing the same error after granting your IAM
service account the appropriate IAM permissions, then check that
your resource is being created in the correct project. Check the
Config Connector resource's spec.projectRef field (or its
cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id annotation if the resource doesn't support a
spec.projectRef field) and verify that the resource is referencing the
correct project. Note that Config Connector uses the namespace's name as the
project ID if neither the resource nor namespace specifies a target project.
Read more about how to configure the target project for project-scoped
resources .
If you're still seeing the same error, then check if Workload Identity Federation for GKE is
enabled on your GKE cluster .
To mitigate this issue in the future, ensure that you follow the
Config Connector installation
instructions .
Update error with IAMPolicy, IAMPartialPolicy and IAMPolicyMember
Symptom
You see an UpdateFailed status with an error message indicating a 400 error because the service account does not exist:
Update call failed: error setting policy member: error applying changes: summary: Request `Create IAM Members roles/[MYROLE] serviceAccount:[NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com for project \"projects/[PROJECT_ID]\"` returned error: Error applying IAM policy for project \"projects/[PROJECT_ID]\": Error setting IAM policy for project \"projects/[PROJECT_ID]\": googleapi: Error 400: Service account [NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com does not exist., badRequest
Cause
If you delete an IAMServiceAccount Config Connector resource before cleaning up IAMPolicy , IAMPartialPolicy , and IAMPolicyMember resources that depend on that service account,
Config Connector cannot locate the service account referenced in those IAM resources during reconciliation.
Resolution
To resolve this issue, check your service accounts and see if the required
service account for those IAM resources is deleted. If the
service account is deleted, clean up the related IAM
Config Connector resources, too. For IAMPolicyMember , delete the whole
resource. For IAMPolicy and IAMParitialPolicy , only remove the bindings that
involve the deleted service account. However, such cleanup doesn't remove
Google Cloud role bindings immediately. The Google Cloud role
bindings are retained for 60 days because of the retention on the deleted
service account. For more information, see the Google Cloud
IAM documentation about
Delete a service account .
Note: If you encounter any problems during deletion, you might need to do a
forced cleanup . If you want to delete the Google Cloud
IAM bindings right away, you need to manually delete the
underlying Google Cloud resources using gcloud .
To avoid this issue, you should always clean up IAMPolicy , IAMPartialPolicy ,
IAMPolicyMember Config Connector resources before deleting the referenced
IAMServiceAccount .
ServiceIdentity resource fails with IAM_SERVICE_NOT_CONFIGURED_FOR_IDENTITIES
Symptom
Your ServiceIdentity resource has an UpdateFailed status, with an error message
similar to the following:
Update call failed: error applying desired state: summary: Error creating Service Identity: googleapi: Error 400: com.google.api.tenant.error.TenantManagerException: IAM_SERVICE_NOT_CONFIGURED_FOR_IDENTITIES: ...
Cause
This error means that the specified resource does not support on-demand service identity creation.
Resolution
The ServiceIdentity resource can generate service identities only for
supported services. To verify if a service supports on-demand service identity
creation before applying your configuration, run the following command:
gcloud beta services identity create --service SERVICE_NAME .googleapis.com
Replace SERVICE_NAME with the name of the service,
for example spanner .
If the command succeeds, Config Connector can create an identity for that
service. If the command fails, it means Config Connector can't create an identity
for that service.
Installation and upgrades
The following section lists common issues related to installation or upgrading
the version of Config Connector.
Version not supported in Config Connector add-on installations
Symptom
If you can't enable the Config Connector add-on successfully, the following
error message appears: Node version 1.15.x-gke.x s unsupported .
The error message also appears if
Workload Identity Federation for GKE
or
GKE Monitoring
are disabled.
Cause
The version of the GKE cluster doesn't meet the requirements or required features are disabled.
Resolution
To solve this error, verify that the version of the GKE cluster meets the
version and feature requirements .
Ensure that Workload Identity Federation for GKE and GKE Monitoring are enabled.
To get all valid versions for your clusters, run the following command:
gcloud container get-server-config --format "yaml(validMasterVersions)" \
--zone ZONE
Replace ZONE with the Compute Engine zone.
Pick a version from the list that meets the
requirements .
failed calling webhook
Symptom
You cannot uninstall Config Connector and receive an error similar to the following:
error during reconciliation: error building deployment objects: error finalizing the deletion of Config Connector system components deployed by ConfigConnector controller: error waiting for CRDs to be deleted: error deleting CRD accesscontextmanageraccesslevels.accesscontextmanager.cnrm.cloud.google.com: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "abandon-on-uninstall.cnrm.cloud.google.com" : failed to call webhook: Post "https://abandon-on-uninstall.cnrm-system.svc:443/abandon-on-uninstall?timeout=3s" : service "abandon-on-uninstall" not found
Cause
This issue can occur when using the Config Connector add-on and disabling Config Connector before
removing the Config Connector CRDs .
Resolution
To resolve this error, you must first manually delete the webhooks:
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration abandon-on-uninstall.cnrm.cloud.google.com --ignore-not-found --wait = true
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration validating-webhook.cnrm.cloud.google.com --ignore-not-found --wait = true
kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration mutating-webhook.cnrm.cloud.google.com --ignore-not-found --wait = true
You can then proceed to uninstall Config Connector.
PodSecurityPolicy prevents upgrades
Symptom
After
switching from the Config Connector add-on to a manual install
and upgrading Config Connector to a new version, cnrm Pods fail to update.
Cause
The use of PodSecurityPolicies can prevent cnrm Pods from updating.
To confirm that the PodSecurityPolicies are preventing your upgrade,
check the config-connector-operator 's events
and look for an error similar to the following:
create Pod configconnector-operator-0 in StatefulSet configconnector-operator failed error: pods "configconnector-operator-0" is forbidden: PodSecurityPolicy: unable to admit pod: [ pod.metadata.annotations [ seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod ] : Forbidden: seccomp may not be set pod.metadata.annotations [ container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/manager ] : Forbidden: seccomp may not be set ]
Resolution
To resolve this issue, you must
specify the annotation on the PodSecurityPolicy
that corresponds to the annotation mentioned in the error. In the
previous example, the annotation is seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io .
Configuration
The following section lists common issues relating to configuring resources.
Cannot make changes to immutable fields
Config Connector rejects updates to immutable fields at
admission .
For example, updating an immutable field with kubectl apply causes the
command to fail immediately.
This means that tools which continuously re-apply resources (for example,
GitOps) might find themselves getting stuck while updating a resource if they
don't handle admission errors.
Since Config Connector does not allow updates to immutable fields, the only way
to perform such an update is to delete and re-create the resource.
Error updating the immutable fields when there is no update
You might see the following errors in the status of the Config Connector
resource shortly after you create or acquire a Google Cloud resource using
Config Connector:
Update call failed: error applying desired state: infeasible update: ({true \<nil\>}) would require recreation
( example )
Update call failed: cannot make changes to immutable field(s)
( example )
This might not mean that you've actually updated the resource, but the reason
might be that the Google Cloud API has made a change to an immutable field
that was managed by you in the Config Connector resource. This caused the
mismatch between the desired state and the live state of the immutable fields.
You can resolve the issue by updating the values of those immutable fields in
the Config Connector resource to match the live state. To achieve it, you should
complete the following steps:
Update the YAML configuration of the Config Connector resource and set
the cnrm.cloud.google.com/deletion-policy annotation to abandon .
Apply the updated YAML configuration to update the Config Connector
resource's deletion policy.
Abandon the Config Connector resource .
Print out the live state of the corresponding Google Cloud resource
using gcloud CLI.
Find the mismatch in between the gcloud CLI output and the YAML
configuration of the Config Connector resource, and update those fields in
the YAML configuration.
Apply the updated YAML configuration to
acquire the abandoned resource .
No matches for kind "Foo"
Symptom
You see the error No matches for kind "Foo" .
Cause
Your Kubernetes cluster does not have the CRD for the Foo resource kind installed.
Resolution
Verify that the kind is a resource kind supported by
Config Connector .
If the kind is supported, then that means your Config Connector installation is
either out-of-date or invalid.
If you installed Config Connector using the GKE add-on, then
your installation should be upgraded automatically. If you manually installed
Config Connector, then you must perform a manual
upgrade .
Check the GitHub repository to determine which resource kinds are supported by
which Config Connector versions (for example, here are the kinds supported by
Config Connector v1.44.0 ).
Labels are not propagated to the Google Cloud resource
Symptom
Labels in your YAML are not showing up on the Google Cloud resource.
Cause
Not all Google Cloud resources support labels.
Resolution
Config Connector propagates labels found in metadata.labels to the underlying
Google Cloud resource. Check the resource's REST API documentation (for
example, here is the API documentation for
PubSubTopic ) to see if they
support labels.
Error due to special characters in resource name
Symptom
You see an error related to invalid characters in metadata.name :
a lowercase RFC 1123 subdomain must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'example.com', regex used for validation is '[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*')
Cause
Special characters are not valid in the Kubernetes metadata.name field.
Resolution
If you'd like to give your resource a name that is not a valid Kubernetes name,
but is a valid Google Cloud resource name, you can use the
resourceID ,
field as shown in the following example:
apiVersion : sql.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : SQLUser
metadata :
name : 'test'
spec :
instanceRef :
name : sqlinstance-sample-postgresql
host : "%"
type : CLOUD_IAM_USER
resourceID : test.example@example-project.iam
This configuration causes Config Connector to use resourceID instead of
metadata.name as the name of the resource.
Unable to remove fields from resource spec
Symptom
Removing a field from a Config Connector resource's spec does not remove it from the resource.
Cause
Removing a field from the spec for a resource managed by Config Connector does not make that field empty or revert to a default value. Instead,
it causes that field to become
externally-managed .
Note: There is one exception: fields inside lists. Lists are atomic, which means
Config Connector will try to set the list in the underlying Google Cloud
to be equivalent to the one specified in the spec.
Resolution
If you want to change value of a field to empty or default in the underlying
Google Cloud resource, you must zero-out the field in the
Config Connector resource spec:
For list type field, set the field to an empty list by using [] .
The following example shows the targetServiceAccounts field that we want to remove:
spec :
targetServiceAccounts :
- external : "foo-bar@foo-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
- external : "bar@foo-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
To remove this field, set the value to empty:
spec :
targetServiceAccounts : []
For primitive type field, set the field to empty by using one of the following:
Type
Empty value
string
""
bool
"false"
integer
0
The following example shows the identityNamespace field that we want to remove:
spec :
workloadIdentityConfig :
identityNamespace : "foo-project.svc.id.goog"
To remove this field, set the value to empty:
spec :
workloadIdentityConfig :
identityNamespace : ""
For object type fields, you can try to set the subfields of the
object type as empty or default following the guidance in the previous section and verify if it works.
However, this is not guaranteed to work.
Config Connector fails to start on Arm-based nodes
If your cluster contains node pools using the Arm architecture (such as the C4A,
N4A, or Tau T2A machine series), Config Connector components might fail to run.
This is a known limitation because Config Connector does not support
Arm-based systems.
Symptoms
If your Config Connector instance is affected by this issue, you might experience
the following symptoms:
Pods in the cnrm-system namespace remain in the Pending state.
Pods may show a CrashLoopBackOff with an error message in the logs similar to:
exec user process caused "exec format error" .
Describing the Pod reveals scheduling failures or architecture mismatches.
Resolution
To resolve this issue, ensure that Config Connector components are scheduled on
nodes with x86 architecture:
Add an x86 node pool : If your cluster only contains Arm nodes, add at
least one node pool using an x86 machine type (such as e2-standard-2 ) to
host the Config Connector controller Pods.
Verify node taints : GKE Arm nodes are typically tainted
with kubernetes.io/arch=arm64:NoSchedule to prevent x86-only workloads
from being scheduled on them. Ensure that you haven't added tolerations to
the Config Connector deployments that would allow them to run on these
nodes.
Forced cleanup
If your Config Connector resources are stuck on deletion and you simply want to
get rid of them from your Kubernetes cluster, you can force their deletion by
deleting their
finalizers .
Warning: This operation should be done as a last resort since deletions of
finalizers is outside the bounds of normal usage for Config Connector and could
have unintended consequences. In particular, there are no guarantees as to what
happens to the underlying Google Cloud resources.
You can delete a resource's finalizers by editing the resource using kubectl
edit , deleting the metadata.finalizers field, and then saving the file to
preserve your changes to the Kubernetes API Server.
Since deleting a resource's finalizers allows the resource to be immediately
deleted from the Kubernetes cluster, Config Connector might (but not
necessarily) not get a chance to complete the deletion of the underlying
Google Cloud resource. This means that you might want to manually delete
your Google Cloud resources afterwards.
Monitoring
Monitoring Config Connector and exploring its logs can help you determine the
soruce of issues and better understand unexpected behavior.
Metrics
You can use Prometheus to collect and show metrics from
Config Connector .
Logging
All Config Connector Pods output structured logs in JSON format.
The logs of the controller Pods are particularly
useful for debugging issues with the reconciliation of resources.
You can query for logs for specific resources by filtering for the following
fields in the log messages:
logger : contains the resource's kind in lower-case . For example, PubSubTopic resources have a logger of pubsubtopic-controller .
resource.namespace : contains the resource's namespace.
resource.name : contains the resource's name.
Using Logging for advanced log querying
If you are using GKE, you can use Cloud Logging to query for
logs for a specific resource with the
following query:
Note: The querying syntax doesn't support comments. The following query uses a
commenting convention, # comment, to provide explanatory text, but these
comments cannot be included in queries.
# Filter to include only logs coming from the controller Pods
resource . type = "k8s_container"
resource . labels . container_name = "manager"
resource . labels . namespace_name = "cnrm-system"
labels . k8s - pod / cnrm_cloud_google_com / component = "cnrm-controller-manager"
# Filter to include only logs coming from a particular GKE cluster
resource . labels . cluster_name = " GKE_CLUSTER_NAME "
resource . labels . location = " GKE_CLUSTER_LOCATION "
# Filter to include only logs for a particular Config Connector resource
jsonPayload . logger = " RESOURCE_KIND -controller"
jsonPayload . resource . namespace = " RESOURCE_NAMESPACE "
jsonPayload . resource . name = " RESOURCE_NAME "
Replace the following:
GKE_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of the GKE cluster running Config Connector
GKE_CLUSTER_LOCATION with the location of the GKE cluster running Config Connector. For example, us-central1 .
RESOURCE_KIND with the resource's kind in lower-case . For example, pubsubtopic .
RESOURCE_NAMESPACE with the resource's namespace.
RESOURCE_NAME with the resource's name.
