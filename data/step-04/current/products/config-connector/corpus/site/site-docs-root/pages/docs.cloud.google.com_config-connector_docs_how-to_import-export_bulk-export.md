Bulk importing and exporting existing Google Cloud resources
This page describes the config-connector bulk-export command and how to use it to
export Google Cloud resources into Config Connector YAML files
which you can subsequently import into Config Connector.
config-connector bulk-export uses
Cloud Asset Inventory 's Export functionality
to discover existing Google Cloud resources. You can provide a
Cloud Asset Inventory export or config-connector can perform the export on your behalf.
Cloud Asset Inventory exports JSON structures. Each structure has the name of the
resource, its Asset Inventory type, and its ancestor resources: projects,
folders, and organization. To discover the types supported by asset inventory,
see
Supported asset types .
Limitations
Not all resources support the bulk-export command. To get a list of supported
resources, run config-connector print-resources .
Before you begin
Install the config-connector tool
If you want to use the config-connector tool to export directly from
Cloud Asset Inventory, enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API on your Google Cloud
Identity's project with gcloud .
gcloud services enable cloudasset.googleapis.com
Bulk export example
In this example, you create a PubSubTopic with the Google Cloud CLI and then
import it into Config Connector.
Create a topic named sample-topic with the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud pubsub topics create sample-topic
You receive confirmation that the topic has been created.
Created topic [projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/sample-topic].
In the output, PROJECT_ID is replaced with your
Google Cloud project.
Get the topic's Google Cloud resource name and save it into an
environment variable with the following command:
TOPIC_RESOURCE_NAME = $( gcloud pubsub topics describe sample-topic --format "value(name)" )
To identify objects, the config-connector tool uses Cloud Asset Inventory JSON
structures. Save the topic asset's JSON structure into an environment
variable:
TOPIC_ASSET = '{"name":"//pubsub.googleapis.com/' " ${ TOPIC_RESOURCE_NAME } " '","asset_type":"pubsub.googleapis.com/Topic"}'
Pass the asset into config-connector bulk-export by running the following command:
echo ${ TOPIC_ASSET } | config-connector bulk-export
The output is a Config Connector resource in YAML format.
---
apiVersion : pubsub.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : PubSubTopic
metadata :
annotations :
cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id : PROJECT_ID
name : sample-topic
...
In the output, PROJECT_ID is replaced with your
Google Cloud project.
You can pass this resource into Config Connector with kubectl apply -f - .
To pass the resource directly, run the following command:
echo ${ TOPIC_ASSET } | config-connector bulk-export | kubectl apply -f - --namespace CC_NAMESPACE
Replace CC_NAMESPACE with the namespace that Config Connector
manages resources from.
Config Connector
acquires the resource .
Confirm that Config Connector is managing the resource with
kubectl describe :
kubectl describe pubsubtopic sample-topic --namespace CC_NAMESPACE
Replace CC_NAMESPACE with the namespace that Config Connector
manages resources from.
Cleaning up
You can delete your PubSubTopic with config-connector bulk-export and
kubectl delete .
echo ${ TOPIC_ASSET } | config-connector bulk-export | kubectl delete -f - --namespace CC_NAMESPACE
Replace CC_NAMESPACE with the namespace that Config Connector
manages resources from.
Discovering resources to import
When importing resources, you can perform a
Cloud Asset Inventory export and supply the
results to config-connector bulk-export or have config-connector bulk-export perform one on your
behalf.
Importing from an Cloud Asset Inventory export
You can provide an asset inventory export by providing a path to a local file
containing the export or piping the results of an export to config-connector
on STDIN.
Importing from a local file
You can provide an
asset inventory export
to config-connector bulk-export by using a local file with the --input parameter.
config-connector bulk-export --input ASSET_INVENTORY_EXPORT
Replace ASSET_INVENTORY_EXPORT with the filename of your Cloud Asset Inventory
export.
Importing from STDIN
To provide an asset inventory export on STDIN, pipe the results of an export to
config-connector bulk-export . For example, if your export is in a local file named
export.json , pipe the contents of the file to config-connector bulk-export without
supplying any of the export parameters.
cat export.json | config-connector bulk-export
Filtering an Asset Inventory export on STDIN
To filter an asset inventory export, you can use the
jq tool and pipe to input the
results to config-connector bulk-export . For example, if you want to only import
PubSubTopic assets from the file EXPORT_FILE , run the following
command:
cat EXPORT_FILE | jq '. | select( .asset_type == "pubsub.googleapis.com/Topic" )' | config-connector bulk-export
Exporting an inventory with config-connector
The config-connector bulk-export tool can export resources from a Google Cloud
Resource hierarchy .
Note: You might not have permissions to export all of the resources in your
project, folder, or organization. If you encounter an error converting asset ,
try the same command with the option
-on-error continue .
Exporting your project
To export all resources from your project, use the --project parameter.
config-connector bulk-export --project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project.
Exporting your folder
To export all resources from a folder, use the --folder parameter.
config-connector bulk-export --folder FOLDER_NUMBER
Replace FOLDER_NUMBER with your Google Cloud folder number.
Exporting your organization
To export all resources from your organization, use the --organization
parameter.
config-connector bulk-export --organization ORGANIZATION_ID
Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with your Google Cloud organization ID.
Cloud Storage location
Asset inventory export's output location is a
Cloud Storage URI. When
config-connector bulk-export performs an export, it uses a
Cloud Storage bucket. By default, config-connector bulk-export
creates a temporary bucket. You can also specify the bucket name.
Temporary Cloud Storage bucket
If you do not provide the --storage-key parameter, config-connector
bulk-export creates a temporary Cloud Storage bucket on your behalf. The
bucket is created in the default location for storage buckets; the US
multi-region . The bucket is deleted when
the export is complete.
Specifying a temporary bucket
To specify a bucket, use a Cloud Storage URI with the storage-key
parameter. If the URI is only the name of the bucket, then a name is generated
for the export storage object. If the URI is a full path to a storage object,
then the full path is used.
config-connector bulk-export --storage-key gs:// BUCKET_NAME
Output
The output from the config-connector bulk-export command is
Config Connector resources in YAML format. The YAML file is written to
STDOUT by default. You can direct the output of resources to files with the
output option.
Output to a single file
When you set the --output parameter, config-connector bulk-export writes its results to a
single file if one of the following is true:
The file specified by output exists and is a
regular file.
The file specified by output does not exist and the parent directory
represented by output does exist.
Output to a directory
config-connector writes its results to multiple files when the --output
parameter is a directory that ends in a / . config-connector bulk-export creates one
file per resource, and file names match their resource names.
config-connector bulk-export --project PROJECT_ID --on-error continue --output OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project.
For example, to output assets from the project my-project to the sample
directory, run the following command:
config-connector bulk-export --project my-project --on-error continue --output sample/
Command-line options
The config-connector bulk-export command has the following options:
config-connector bulk-export
