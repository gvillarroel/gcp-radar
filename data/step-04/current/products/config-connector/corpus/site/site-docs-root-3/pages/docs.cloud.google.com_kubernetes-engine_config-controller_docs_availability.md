Configure Config Controller for high-availability
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how best to use Config Controller when operating
highly-available services or managing resources in multiple Google Cloud regions.
This page is for Admins and architects and Operators who
manage the lifecycle of the underlying tech infrastructure and plan capacity and
infrastructure needs. To learn more about common roles and example tasks that we
reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Config Controller runs in a single region,
so it can tolerate the failure of an availability zone, but if an entire region
fails, Config Controller loses availability. There are two different
strategies to deal with regional failure, and your choice depends on what you
would do if a region fails:
If you would make configuration changes in response to a regional failure,
create a second Config Controller instance .
If you would not make configuration changes,
use a single Config Controller instance .
Note: While planning for failure is important,
regions offer sufficient availability for many applications .
Understand failure scenarios
Config Controller uses a
regional GKE cluster .
Although the regional cluster can tolerate the failure of a single zone in a
region, the cluster becomes unavailable if multiple zones in the region fail.
If your Config Controller instance fails, your existing Google Cloud
resources remain in their current state. However, even if your applications are
still running, you cannot change their configuration when Config Controller
is unavailable. This applies to resources in the same region and to
resources in other regions that you are managing from the Config Controller
in the unavailable region.
Because you can't reconfigure resources in the same region, if a regional
failure does affect existing Google Cloud resources in the Config Controller
region, you cannot repair those resources.
Because you also can't reconfigure resources in other regions, a failure
in one region has now affected your ability to make changes in another region.
Other failure scenarios are also possible. For example, if you configure
Config Sync to pull from an external Git provider, you should consider the
failure modes of that Git provider. You might not be able to make configuration
changes because you cannot push changes to that Git provider. Or if
Config Sync cannot read from Git, then any Git changes aren't applied to the
cluster, and so Config Connector does not apply them. However, regional failure is
often the most important failure scenario, because other failure scenarios are
typically uncorrelated with Config Controller failure.
Use a single cluster for regional availability
In many scenarios, you would not perform any reconfiguration if a region fails.
In that case, you might choose to accept that a regional failure causes your
configuration control-plane to become unavailable.
For example, if you only operate in a single region, there might not be any
useful reconfiguration you can do if that region fails. Similarly, if you have a
single point of failure database in a single region, you might not be able to
recover until that region recovers. For applications that do not need the
absolute highest availability, this situation can be a reasonable trade-off
against cost and complexity.
Locating the Config Controller instance in the same region gives you a shared
fate: Config Controller is available as long as your primary region is
available. Locating the Config Controller instance in a different region
can also be a good choice; although you now have to think about potential
failures in two regions, you avoid the correlated-failure of your configuration
control-plane with the failure of your primary region.
Alternatively, if you have a multi-regional redundant configuration,
your system might automatically steer away from failed regions. Here too, you
might not want to do reconfiguration if a region fails. In this case, you might
choose a single Config Controller instance.
Manually failover to a second Config Controller instance
You might want to do some reconfiguration if a region fails so that you can
remedy the failure. You might also want to continue configuring resources in
other regions, even if your Config Controller instance is located in a
failed region. In this case, we recommend using a second Config Controller
instance in a second region.
Though it is not recommended, two Config Controller instances can run with
identical configurations. Both instances race to read from the same Git repository
and apply the same changes to Google Cloud. However, numerous edge-cases
make this configuration unreliable. The two Config Controller instances observe
the Git repository at slightly different times; they might attempt to apply
slightly different versions of your Google Cloud configuration. Multiple
active writers to Google Cloud make it more likely that you encounter quotas or rate limits.
A small number of Config Connector resources are also
not idempotent ,
and need extra care as discussed in the rest of this section. We therefore
recommend against having two Config Controller clusters both actively
reconciling.
We recommend instead that if the region running your Config Controller
fails, then you run another Config Controller in a second
region. The new Config Controller instance should be configured identically
to the first one, reading from the same Git repository. Pre-preparing
a script to bring up and configure your Config Controller instance might
be useful in this scenario. When you create your new Config Controller instance,
Config Sync reads and applies the desired state from Git to Kubernetes;
Config Connector synchronizes the desired state to Google Cloud.
There are two things to be careful of in this situation:
If the first Config Controller cluster is still running, or starts
running when the first region recovers, then it might attempt to apply the old
state to Google Cloud. If you can stop the Config Controller cluster in the
first region before starting a second Config Controller cluster,
you can avoid this potential conflict.
Not all Config Connector resources can be seamlessly reapplied from Git.
For the list of resources that need special care, see resources with
restrictions around acquisition .
In particular, we recommend being careful around Folder resources, and
avoiding IAMServiceAccountKey resources (for example, using GKE
Workload Identity Federation for GKE instead).
Note: If you need to reconfigure resources when a region fails, you should
consider running Config Controller in a different region from your primary
Google Cloud services. This configuration helps you avoid a single regional
failure affecting your Config Controller instance at the exact time you need
it.
One Config Controller instance per region
If you want to avoid a Config Controller instance in one region affecting
another region, you might also consider running a Config Controller
instance per region, where each Config Controller instance manages
resources in that region.
This configuration is workable, but it isn't one of our recommended options
for the following reasons:
Some resources span multiple regions (such as Cloud DNS), which makes this
strategy limited.
Generally, having a Config Controller cluster in the same region
encounters the correlated-failure problem: you want to reconfigure resources
exactly when a regional failure affects the Config Controller in
that region.
You have to split up your Config Connector resources by region.
Config Controller is not currently available in all regions.
Directly configuring Google Cloud resources
In exceptional circumstances, you might make changes directly to the
underlying Google Cloud resources, without going through Git or Config Connector.
Config Connector tries to remediate any "drift", so if your Config Controller
instance is still running, Config Connector considers any changes you make manually
to be "drift" and tries to revert them.
However, if you stop your Config Controller instance, or if the region is
offline, this can be a useful stop-gap measure.
When your Config Controller instance recovers, Config Connector will likely try
to revert your manual changes. To avoid this situation, you can make corresponding
changes in Git for any changes you make manually.
