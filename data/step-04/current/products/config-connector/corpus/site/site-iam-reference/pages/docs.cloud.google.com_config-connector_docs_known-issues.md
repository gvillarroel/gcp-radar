Resources
1.126.0
1.134.1
Fixed: Resource creation blocked by webhook TLS error: "`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`"
When attempting to create or apply new Config Connector resources, the Kubernetes API server rejects the request and blocks resource creation. You are unable to deploy new resources, but existing resources might continue to reconcile normally. This issue is caused by a known race condition within the cnrm-webhook-manager component in Config Connector versions earlier than 1.134.1.
You might see an error similar to the following in your deployment outputs or API server logs:
failed calling webhook "container-annotation-handler.cnrm.cloud.google.com": failed to call webhook: Post "https://cnrm-validating-webhook.cnrm-system.svc:443/...": tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
Additionally, the cnrm-webhook-manager Pod logs might display the following:
http: TLS handshake error ... remote error: tls: bad certificate.
Workaround:
To immediately unblock resource creation, you can force the webhook manager Pods to synchronize and pull the correct certificate data by restarting the deployment with the following command:
kubectl rollout restart deployment cnrm-webhook-manager -n cnrm-system
Resources
1.134
1.134.2
Fixed: SQLInstance stuck in Updating state with "merge" annotation error
Affected SQLInstance resources might become stuck in an Updating state with an error message regarding the state-into-spec annotation.
invalid value "merge" for "cnrm.cloud.google.com/state-into-spec" annotation
This issue occurs because a stricter validation introduced in version 1.134.0 incorrectly rejected the "merge" strategy for SQLInstance resources, even when applied as a default. This is fixed in later versions.
Direct Reconciler
1.131
1.134
Fixed: Issues with direct reconcilers
Config Connector version 1.132.0 introduced issues affecting resources that use the direct reconciler.
Duplicate controller name error
In version 1.132.0, resources such as SpannerInstance and SecretManagerSecret might fail to reconcile with an error indicating that a controller with the same name already exists:
error registering controller: error adding direct controller for SpannerInstance to a manager: error creating new controller: controller with name spannerinstance-controller already exists.
SecretManagerSecret "last-applied-configuration" error
If you enable the direct reconciler for a SecretManagerSecret (using the alpha.cnrm.cloud.google.com/reconciler: direct annotation) in versions 1.131.0 through 1.133, reconciliation might fail with an API error:
[kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration] must follow pattern [a-z0-9A-Z]+([_\.\-]*[a-z0-9A-Z]+)*), be less than 64 characters, and must have a UTF encoding of less than 128 bytes
This occurs because Config Connector incorrectly attempts to pass internal Kubernetes annotations as labels to the Secret Manager API.
Installation, Networking
Kubernetes 1.19
1.43
Fixed: Failed calling webhook x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field error
If you see an error similar to the following example, you might be experiencing
an issue with certificates:
Error from server (InternalError): error when creating "/mnt/set-weaver-dns-record.yml": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "annotation-defaulter.cnrm.cloud.google.com": Post "https://cnrm-validating-webhook.cnrm-system.svc:443/annotation-defaulter?timeout=30s": x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0
This issue occurs with Kubernetes versions 1.19 and later. Config Connector versions 1.43 and later support the automatic generation of the certificate, which should prevent this issue.
Workaround:
To workaround this issue, you can delete the relevant certificates and the Pods:
kubectl delete -n cnrm-system secrets cnrm-webhook-cert-abandon-on-uninstall
kubectl delete -n cnrm-system secrets cnrm-webhook-cert-cnrm-validating-webhook
kubectl delete -n cnrm-system pods -l "cnrm.cloud.google.com/component=cnrm-webhook-manager"
After you have deleted these resources, the correct certificate should regenerate.
