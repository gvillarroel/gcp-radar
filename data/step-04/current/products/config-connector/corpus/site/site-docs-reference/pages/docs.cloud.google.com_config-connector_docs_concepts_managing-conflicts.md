Managing conflicts with multiple Config Connector resources
This page describes how Config Connector handles conflicts. Conflicts can happen
when the same resource is managed by multiple resources.
Config Connector
manages or acquires
resources by mapping the combination of Kubernetes resource name, container
annotation, and if applicable, region or location. In the simplest case, you
organize your resources with Google Cloud
projects .
Google Cloud supports additional levels of hierarchy beyond projects:
folders, projects, and organizations. You can map resources to your
folders, projects, and organizations
with an annotation. When you create a resource without an annotation using
Config Connector, the resource is created in the project that shares the
resource's namespace.
It is possible, but not recommended, to create two Config Connector resources
in different namespaces that manage the same Google Cloud resource.
Config Connector only manages the corresponding Google Cloud resource if
it is able to obtain a lease on the Google Cloud resource and conflict
prevention is enabled .
Leases are namespace-scoped. To obtain a namespace-scoped lease, Config Connector
adds two labels to the resource:
cnrm-lease-holder-id : Config Controller generates a unique ID for
each namespace that manages a resource with conflict prevention enabled. This
unique ID is what's used to set cnrm-lease-holder-id . To see the mapping
of the namespace to the cnrm-lease-holder-id value, you can look at the
namespace-id ConfigMap in the cnrm-system namespace.
cnrm-lease-expiration : An expiration time in
Unix epoch time .
Config Connector is able to update these values if any of the following is
true:
The value of cnrm-lease-holder-id matches the namespace's globally
unique ID.
The value of cnrm-lease-holder-id is empty or non-existent.
The value of cnrm-lease-expiration is in the past.
When a Config Connector instance obtains a lease on a resource, the expiration
time is set to 40 minutes in the future. The same instance of Config Connector
retains management as long as the resource is in the namespace. Config Connector
extends the expiration time by 40 minutes when less than 20 minutes remain.
If Config Connector is unable to obtain a lease on a given resource, the output
of
kubectl describe
on the resource lists a Status of ManagementConflict .
Modifying conflict prevention
You can control conflict prevention by adding the
cnrm.cloud.google.com/management-conflict-prevention-policy annotation to the
resource with one of the following values:
resource : management conflicts are prevented at the resource level by
saving the appropriate lease labels into the resource as described in the
preceding section.
none : management conflicts are not prevented.
The default value is none .
In the following example, a manifest for the default ComputeNetwork uses a
management policy of none , which means that conflicts are not prevented:
apiVersion : compute.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : ComputeNetwork
metadata :
annotations :
cnrm.cloud.google.com/management-conflict-prevention-policy : "none"
cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id : " PROJECT-ID "
cnrm.cloud.google.com/deletion-policy : "abandon"
name : default
spec :
description : Default network for the project
Limitations
Conflict prevention has the following limitations:
Conflict prevention does not work for resources that don't support
labels. Even if you change the value from none to resource , it still
doesn't work.
If you are
Managing resources with the resourceID field
you can create multiple resources with the same Google Cloud resource name,
created under the same namespace. These resources create conflicts that
Config Connector cannot manage.
