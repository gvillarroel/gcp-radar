Project-scoped resources
Config Connector can manage your resources at the project, folder, or
organization level. In order for Config Connector to determine where to create
your resources, it first checks for a scope-defining field
in your resource spec, if not found, then checks for a scope-defining annotation .
Note: The scope concept does not apply to all
Config Connector resources. See Exceptions
for more details. You can check the
resource reference page to see
if a resource supports the spec.projectRef field or cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id annotation.
Specify projectRef field
Most project-scoped Config Connector resources support a field named projectRef
in its CRD spec. Use this field to specify the Google Cloud project that you
want to create the resource in.
If the Google Cloud project is also managed in the same cluster with the
the Project
CRD, you can specify the project as a Kubernetes resource reference:
...
spec :
projectRef :
name : PROJECT_RESOURCE_NAME
namespace : PROJECT_RESOURCE_NAMESPACE
...
This approach makes it possible to use Config Connector and create a Google Cloud
project with its child resources in one single apply operation.
The namespace field is optional if the project Kubernetes resource is in the
same Kubernetes namespace as your project-scoped resource.
If the Google Cloud project is not managed as a Kubernetes resource
in the same cluster, you can use the external field to directly specify the
project ID. The exact format of the value may be different depending on the
resource type. Two most common formats are " PROJECT_ID " and
"projects/ PROJECT_ID ". See an example of
"projects/ PROJECT_ID " below:
...
spec :
projectRef :
external : "projects/ PROJECT_ID "
...
Annotate resource configuration
If the Config Connector resource is project-scoped but does not support
projectRef field, you can set the project ID to the resource configuration
using the project-id annotation:
...
metadata :
annotations :
cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id : PROJECT_ID
...
Here is an example of what a FooBar resource's YAML looks like with this
annotation in it:
apiVersion : foo.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : FooBar
metadata :
annotations :
cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id : PROJECT_ID
name : foobarname
Annotate namespace configuration
You can set a default project ID for newly-created resources by
annotating your Kubernetes namespace. If any of the resources in the namespace
have this annotation explicitly set in its own configuration, the resource-level
annotation overwrites the namespace-level annotation.
To annotate the namespace using command line, run the following command:
kubectl annotate namespace NAMESPACE_NAME cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
NAMESPACE_NAME : your namespace name
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID
Alternatively, you can apply a YAML manifest containing the
annotation. Copy the YAML below into a file:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
annotations :
cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id : PROJECT_ID
name : NAMESPACE_NAME
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID
NAMESPACE_NAME : your namespace name
After you have created the file, apply it to your cluster.
Note: You must create the namespace and annotation before applying any resources
to the namespace.
Using the namespace name as the project ID
If neither the resource nor the namespace specifies a project ID, then
Config Connector uses the namespace's name as the project ID. This default
behavior is supported by Config Connector but we don't recommend it since the
implicit default of project ID can be confusing.
