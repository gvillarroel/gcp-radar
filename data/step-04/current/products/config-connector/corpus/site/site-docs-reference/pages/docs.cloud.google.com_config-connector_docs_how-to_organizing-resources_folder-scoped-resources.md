Folder-scoped resources
Config Connector can manage your resources at the project, folder, or
organization level. In order for Config Connector to determine where to create
your resources, it first checks for a scope-defining field
in your resource spec, if not found, then checks for a scope-defining annotation .
Note: The scope concept does not apply to all
Config Connector resources. See Exceptions
for more details. You can check the
resource reference page to see
if a resource supports the spec.folderRef field or cnrm.cloud.google.com/folder-id annotation.
Specify folderRef field
Most folder-scoped Config Connector resources support a field named folderRef
in its CRD spec. Use this field to specify the Google Cloud folder you
want to create the resource in.
If the Google Cloud folder is also being managed in the same cluster via
the Folder
CRD, you can specify the folder as a Kubernetes resource reference:
...
spec :
folderRef :
name : FOLDER_RESOURCE_NAME
namespace : FOLDER_RESOURCE_NAMESPACE
...
This approach makes it possible to use Config Connector and create a Google Cloud
folder with its child resources in one single apply operation.
The namespace field is optional if the Config Connector Folder resource is in
the same Kubernetes namespace as your folder-scoped resource.
If the Google Cloud folder is not being managed as a Kubernetes resource
in the same cluster, you can use the external field to directly specify the
folder ID. The exact format of the value may be different depending on the
resource type. Two most common formats are " FOLDER_ID " and
"folders/ FOLDER_ID ". See an example of " FOLDER_ID " below:
...
spec :
folderRef :
external : " FOLDER_ID "
...
Annotate resource configuration
If the Config Connector resource is folder-scoped but does not support the
folderRef field, you can set the folder ID to the resource configuration
using the folder-id annotation:
...
metadata :
annotations :
cnrm.cloud.google.com/folder-id : FOLDER_ID
...
Here is an example of what a resource's YAML will look like with this annotation
in it:
apiVersion : foo.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : FooBar
metadata :
annotations :
cnrm.cloud.google.com/folder-id : FOLDER_ID
name : foobarname
Annotate namespace configuration
You can set a default folder ID for newly-created resources by
annotating your Kubernetes namespace. If any of the resources in the namespace
have this annotation explicitly set in its own configuration, the resource-level
annotation overwrites the namespace-level annotation.
To annotate the namespace using command line, run the following command:
kubectl annotate namespace NAMESPACE_NAME cnrm.cloud.google.com/folder-id= FOLDER_ID
Replace the following:
NAMESPACE_NAME : your namespace name
FOLDER_ID : your Google Cloud folder ID
Alternatively, you can apply a YAML manifest containing the annotation.
Copy the YAML below into a file:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
annotations :
cnrm.cloud.google.com/folder-id : FOLDER_ID
name : NAMESPACE_NAME
Replace the following:
FOLDER_ID : your Google Cloud folder ID
NAMESPACE_NAME : your namespace name
After you have created the file, apply it to your cluster.
Note: You must create the namespace and annotation before applying any resources
into the namespace.
