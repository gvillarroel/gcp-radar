Install Config Connector manually
This page explains how to manually install Config Connector.
Manual installation is a flexible option that gives you control over the installed
version and upgrade schedule.
The instructions on this page are focused on installing Config Connector on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. For more information about the different installation options, see
Choosing an installation type .
For most use cases, we recommended manually installing Config Connector in
namespaced mode . The alternative is cluster mode . Namespaced mode is
more scalable and offers better permission isolation, which is ideal for
multi-tenant use cases or when managing resources from multiple projects.
If you prefer a single, cluster-wide service account, instead follow the
instructions for installing in cluster mode .
Before you begin
Before you manually install the Config Connector operator, complete the
following steps:
Create or identify a GKE cluster where
Config Connector has not yet been installed and that has
Workload Identity
and
Kubernetes Engine Monitoring
enabled.
Configure kubectl to connect to your cluster .
Install the Config Connector operator
Config Connector uses a Kubernetes
operator to
keep its installation up to date. Installing the operator is required whether
you're installing Config Connector in namespaced mode or cluster mode.
To install the Config Connector operator, complete the following steps:
Download the latest Config Connector operator .tar file:
gcloud storage cp gs://configconnector-operator/latest/release-bundle.tar.gz release-bundle.tar.gz
Note: Keep a copy of the installation bundle as you need this bundle
to uninstall Config Connector.
Extract the tar file:
tar zxvf release-bundle.tar.gz
Install the Config Connector operator on your cluster:
Autopilot
kubectl apply -f operator-system/autopilot-configconnector-operator.yaml
Standard
kubectl apply -f operator-system/configconnector-operator.yaml
To configure the Config Connector operator to run in namespaced mode, complete the following steps:
Create a manifest named configconnector.yaml with the following content:
apiVersion : core.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : ConfigConnector
metadata :
# the name is restricted to ensure that there is only ConfigConnector resource installed in your cluster
name : configconnector.core.cnrm.cloud.google.com
spec :
mode : namespaced
stateIntoSpec : Absent
Apply the manifest to your cluster:
kubectl apply -f configconnector.yaml
Install Config Connector in namespaced mode
Note: You must perform these steps for every namespace that you want
Config Connector to create resources from.
In the following sections, the project where you install
Config Connector is the host project .
The other projects where you can have Config Connector manage resources are managed projects .
The host and managed project can be the same project, if you
want Config Connector to only create resources in the same project as your cluster.
Create a namespace
Create a new namespace by running the following command:
kubectl create namespace NAMESPACE
Replace NAMESPACE with a name for the namespace.
Create an identity
Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) service account and create a binding between the
IAM Service Account and the Config Connector Kubernetes service
account by completing the following steps:
Create an IAM service account. If you have an existing
service account, you can use it instead of creating a new service account. Use
gcloud to create the service account by running the following command:
gcloud iam service-accounts create NAMESPACE_GSA --project HOST_PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
NAMESPACE_GSA with the name of the Google service account (GSA) bound
to your namespace.
HOST_PROJECT_ID with your host project's ID.
To learn more about creating service accounts, see
Creating and managing service accounts .
Give the IAM service account elevated permissions on
your managed project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding MANAGED_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: NAMESPACE_GSA @ HOST_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/owner"
Replace MANAGED_PROJECT_ID with your managed project's ID.
Note: If you prefer to grant
editor
access to the project replace roles/owner with roles/editor .
Granting the editor role allows most Config Connector functionality except
Project or Organization wide configurations such as IAM
modifications.
Create an IAM policy binding between the
IAM service account and the Config Connector Kubernetes
service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
NAMESPACE_GSA @ HOST_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member = "serviceAccount: HOST_PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog[cnrm-system/cnrm-controller-manager- NAMESPACE ]" \
--role = "roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser"
Give the IAM service account permissions to publish
Prometheus metrics to Google Cloud Observability on your host project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: NAMESPACE_GSA @ HOST_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/monitoring.metricWriter"
Create a ConfigConnectorContext
To create Google Cloud resources, configure Config Connector
to watch your namespace by adding a ConfigConnectorContext object
in that namespace.
To create a ConfigConnectorContext , complete the following steps:
Create a manifest named
configconnectorcontext.yaml with the following content:
apiVersion : core.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : ConfigConnectorContext
metadata :
# you need one ConfigConnectorContext per namespace
name : configconnectorcontext.core.cnrm.cloud.google.com
namespace : NAMESPACE
spec :
googleServiceAccount : " NAMESPACE_GSA @ HOST_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com"
stateIntoSpec : Absent
Apply the manifest to your cluster:
kubectl apply -f configconnectorcontext.yaml
Verify that the Config Connector operator created a Kubernetes service
account for your namespace by running the following command:
kubectl get serviceaccount/cnrm-controller-manager- NAMESPACE -n cnrm-system
Verify that the Config Connector controller Pod is running for your namespace:
kubectl wait -n cnrm-system \
--for = condition = Ready pod \
-l cnrm.cloud.google.com/component = cnrm-controller-manager \
-l cnrm.cloud.google.com/scoped-namespace = NAMESPACE
If the Config Connector controller is running, the output is similar to:
cnrm-controller-manager-abcdefghijk-0 condition met.
Stop managing resources in a namespace
If you want Config Connector to stop managing resources in a namespace, remove all
Config Connector resources and the ConfigConnectorContext object
in that namespace.
To find all Config Connector resources in your namespace, for each
Config Connector Custom Resource Definition, list all resources.
kubectl get gcp -n NAMESPACE
The output of this command lists all Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that
represent a resource managed by Config Connector in that namespace, including
the name and Kubernetes kind of that resource.
To remove all Config Connector resources, for each resource in the output of
the previous step, run the following command:
kubectl delete -n NAMESPACE KIND NAME
Replace the following:
KIND : the Kubernetes kind of the resource.
NAME : the name of the resource.
Delete the ConfigConnectorContext object in your namespace.
kubectl delete -n NAMESPACE ConfigConnectorContext configconnectorcontext.core.cnrm.cloud.google.com
Important: Don't delete the ConfigConnectorContext object until all Config Connector-managed
resources are deleted.
Uninstall Config Connector
To uninstall Config Connector, complete the following steps:
To remove the Config Connector CRDs and controller components, run the following command:
kubectl delete ConfigConnectorContext --all -A –wait = false
kubectl delete ConfigConnector configconnector.core.cnrm.cloud.google.com \
--wait = true
To uninstall the Config Connector operator, run the following command:
kubectl delete -f operator-system/configconnector-operator.yaml --wait = true
Install in cluster mode
You might prefer to install and manage Config Connector in cluster mode if you
want to manage resources within a single project and don't require the
permission separation that namespaced mode provides.
Create an identity
Config Connector creates and manages Google Cloud resources by authenticating with an
Identity and Access Management (IAM) service account and using
Workload Identity Federation for GKE to bind IAM service accounts with Kubernetes
service accounts.
Note: You need to perform these steps only once per cluster.
To create the identity, complete the following steps:
Create an IAM service account. If you want to use an existing service account, you
can use that account and skip this step:
gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with a name for your service account.
To learn more about creating service accounts, see
Creating and managing service accounts .
Give the IAM service account elevated permissions on your project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/editor"
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Note: Granting the editor role allows most Config Connector functionality except
project and organization wide configurations such as IAM
modifications. In a production environment, we recommend that you set more granular permissions.
For more information about IAM roles, see Understanding roles .
Create an IAM policy binding between the IAM
service account and the predefined Kubernetes service account that
Config Connector runs:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member = "serviceAccount: PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog[cnrm-system/cnrm-controller-manager]" \
--role = "roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser"
Configure Config Connector
To complete the installation, create a configuration file for
the ConfigConnector
CustomResource ,
then apply it using the kubectl apply command. The Config Connector Operator installs
Google Cloud resource CRDs and Config Connector components in your cluster.
To configure the operator as cluster mode, complete the following steps:
Copy the following YAML file into a file named configconnector.yaml :
# configconnector.yaml
apiVersion : core.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : ConfigConnector
metadata :
# the name is restricted to ensure that there is only one
# ConfigConnector resource installed in your cluster
name : configconnector.core.cnrm.cloud.google.com
spec :
mode : cluster
googleServiceAccount : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com"
# Setting `stateIntoSpec` to `Absent` is recommended. It means setting `cnrm.cloud.google.com/state-into-spec`
# annotation to `absent` for all Config Connector resources created in the cluster in the future.
# It prevents Config Connector from populating unspecified fields into the spec.
stateIntoSpec : Absent
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with your service account's name.
PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Apply the configuration to your cluster with kubectl apply :
kubectl apply -f configconnector.yaml
Specifying where to create your resources
Config Connector can organize resources by project, folder, or organization,
which is the same way you would organize resources with Google Cloud.
Before creating resources with Config Connector, you must configure where to create your
resources. To determine where to create the resource, Config Connector uses an annotation on either
the resource configuration or an existing Namespace. For more information, see
Organizing resources .
If you do not have a Namespace for this purpose, create one with kubectl .
kubectl create namespace NAMESPACE
Replace NAMESPACE with your namespace name. For example
config-connector .
Select a tab to choose where you want Config Connector to create resources.
Project
To create resources in a certain project ,
run the following command:
kubectl annotate namespace \
NAMESPACE cnrm.cloud.google.com/project-id = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
NAMESPACE with your namespace name.
PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project ID.
Folder
To create resources in a certain folder ,
run the following command:
kubectl annotate namespace \
NAMESPACE cnrm.cloud.google.com/folder-id = FOLDER_ID
Replace the following:
NAMESPACE with your namespace name.
FOLDER_ID with your Google Cloud folder ID.
Organization
To create resources in a certain organization ,
run the following command:
kubectl annotate namespace \
NAMESPACE cnrm.cloud.google.com/organization-id = ORGANIZATION_ID
Replace the following:
NAMESPACE with your namespace name.
ORGANIZATION_ID with your Google Cloud organization ID.
When you annotate your namespace, Config Connector creates resources in the
corresponding project, folder or organization. To learn more about how
Config Connector uses Kubernetes namespaces, see
Kubernetes Namespaces and Google Cloud projects .
Verify your installation
Config Connector runs all of its components in a namespace named cnrm-system .
You can verify the Pods are ready by running the following command:
kubectl wait -n cnrm-system \
--for=condition=Ready pod --all
If Config Connector is installed correctly, the output is similar to the
following:
pod/cnrm-controller-manager-0 condition met
Note: The controller Pod can take several minutes to start.
Uninstall Config Connector
To uninstall Config Connector, complete the following steps:
To remove the Config Connector CRDs and controller components, run the following command:
kubectl delete ConfigConnector configconnector.core.cnrm.cloud.google.com \
--wait = true
To uninstall the Config Connector operator, run the following command:
kubectl delete -f operator-system/configconnector-operator.yaml --wait = true
Upgrade Config Connector
To download and install the latest version of Config Connector operator,
run the following command:
gcloud storage cp gs://configconnector-operator/latest/release-bundle.tar.gz release-bundle.tar.gz
tar zxvf release-bundle.tar.gz
kubectl apply -f operator-system/configconnector-operator.yaml
Downgrade Config Connector
Fully downgrading Config Connector is not supported. To downgrade both the
Config Connector operator and CRDs, you must uninstall, reinstall Config Connector,
and then re-apply your resources.
In Config Connector version 1.123.1 and later, you can roll back the operator
version for installations that use namespaced mode .
In each namespace that has an operator you want to roll back, set the spec.version
field in the ConfigConnectorContext object to the previous Config Connector
version.
You can roll back the Config Connector controller by a maximum of 3 minor
versions. You must always roll back to the latest patch version for a given
minor version.
Upgrade from non-operator installations
Config Connector version 1.33.0 and higher only supports installation with the
GKE add-on , or the operator.
To upgrade to the operator (and retain all Config Connector resources), you must
remove all Config Connector system components except the CRDs, and then install
the operator.
Run the following commands to remove Config Connector system non-CRD
components:
kubectl delete sts,deploy,po,svc,roles,clusterroles,clusterrolebindings --all-namespaces -l cnrm.cloud.google.com/system = true --wait = true
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration abandon-on-uninstall.cnrm.cloud.google.com --ignore-not-found --wait = true
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration validating-webhook.cnrm.cloud.google.com --ignore-not-found --wait = true
kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration mutating-webhook.cnrm.cloud.google.com --ignore-not-found --wait = true
Install Config Connector with the
GKE add-on , or the operator .
Switch from the add-on to a manual installation
When installed as an add-on, the version of Config Connector is directly tied
to the GKE version that is installed.
The manual installation allows for faster updates at the cost of manual
upgrades.
To switch installation methods and safely retain your resources, complete the following steps:
Disable the addon without deleting any ConfigConnector or ConfigConnectorContext objects:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME --update-addons ConfigConnector = DISABLED
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name of the cluster that
you installed Config Connector on.
Install the manual operator of the chosen version .
To prevent potential CRD validation errors (for example, KNV2009: Invalid
value: "v1beta1": must appear in spec.versions ), the chosen version of the
manual operator must be the same or later than the version you were using for
the add-on. Downgrading the manual operator version can cause errors (for
example, KNV2009) because the GKE add-on might have already
upgraded certain CRDs to a later Config Connector version.
Note: Because the namespace-id ConfigMap in the
configconnector-operator-system namespace is deleted as part of disabling the
add-on, old cnrm-controller-manager StatefulSets are recreated.
