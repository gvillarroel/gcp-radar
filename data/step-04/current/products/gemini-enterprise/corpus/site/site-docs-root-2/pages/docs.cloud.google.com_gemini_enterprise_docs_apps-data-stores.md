About apps and data stores

This page describes Gemini Enterprise apps and data stores.
With Gemini Enterprise, you create an app and connect it to a data store. A
given Google Cloud project can contain multiple apps.
Key terms:
App : A Gemini Enterprise app provides search results, actions, and
agents to your end users. The term app can be used interchangeably with the
term engine in the context of APIs.
Data store : A data store is an entity that contains the data ingested from
a first-party data source such as Cloud Storage or third-party
applications such as Jira or Salesforce. Data stores that contain data from
third-party applications are also called data connectors .
Relationship between apps and data stores
An app must be connected to a data store in order to use the data from it to
serve search results, answers, or actions.
Apps have a many-to-many relationship with data stores. When multiple data
stores are connected to a single app, this is referred to as blended search .
For information about limitations of connecting a search app to more than one
data store, see About blended search .
Note: You can't connect website data stores to your
Gemini Enterprise search and assistant apps.
Method of app creation and data ingestion
How you create an app and ingest data depends on the type of data you have:
For third-party data, you use the Google Cloud console, not the API, to create
your app and ingest data.
For other data, you can use either the Google Cloud console or the API.
Documents
Each data store has one or more data records, called documents . What a
document represents varies depending on the type of data in the data store:
Data for third-party data sources . A document is an entity specific to the
third-party data source, such as a Jira issue or Confluence space.
Structured data . A document is a row in a table or a JSON
record that follows a particular schema. You can provide this schema yourself
or you can let Gemini Enterprise derive the schema from the ingested
data.
Unstructured data . A document is a file in HTML, PDF with embedded text,
or TXT format. PPTX and DOCX formats are available in Preview.
Data stores and apps
In Gemini Enterprise, there are various kinds of data stores.
A data store can contain only one type of data.
Third-party data
Structured data
Unstructured data
Structured data for third-party data stores
The following third-party data source connectors are available in Preview with
allowlist:
Confluence
Jira
Salesforce
Sharepoint Online
Slack
Data from these third parties is considered structured data.
When you set up a new connector, you select a synchronization frequency. You
also select which entities to sync. Entities vary depending on the source, such
as issues for Jira and content and spaces for Confluence. A unique data store is
created for each entity. Entity data stores are grouped by connector instance.
What's next
Connect a third-party data source .
Create an app .
Structured data
A data store with structured data enables semantic search or recommendations
over structured data. You can import data from BigQuery or
Cloud Storage. You can also manually upload structured JSON data through the
API.
For example, you can enable search or recommendations over a product catalog for
your ecommerce experience or a directory of doctors for provider search or
recommendations.
Gemini Enterprise auto-detects the schema from the data that you
import. Optionally, you can provide a schema for your data. Providing a schema
for your data typically improves the quality of results.
What's next
Prepare structured data for ingestion .
Create a search data store using one of these methods:
Import from BigQuery .
Import from Cloud Storage .
Create an app .
Unstructured data
An unstructured data store enables semantic search or recommendations over data
such as documents and images.
Unstructured data stores support documents in HTML, PDF with embedded text, and
TXT format. PPTX and DOCX formats are available in Preview.
Search provides results in the form of 10 URLs and summarized answers for
natural language queries. Documents must be uploaded to a Cloud Storage
bucket with appropriate access permissions. For example, a financial institution
can enable search or recommendations over their private corpus of financial
research publications, or a biotech company can enable search or recommendations
over their private repository of medical research.
What's next
Prepare unstructured data for ingestion .
Create a search data store using one of these methods:
Import from BigQuery .
Import from Cloud Storage .
Sync from Google Drive .
Create a first-party datastore for your unstructured data.
Create an app .
About blended search
With blended search, multiple data stores can be connected to a single app. This
lets the app search across multiple sources and types of data.
Note: Blended search is rate-limited in the Gemini Enterprise Standard and
Gemini Enterprise Frontline editions. Unlimited and enhanced blended search
requires the Gemini Enterprise Plus edition.
To make a blended search app, select multiple data stores when creating a new
app. If you don't select multiple data stores during creation, then you can't
add additional data stores later.
When getting search results, you can either search across all data stores, or
filter for results from a single data store.
Blended search has the following limitations:
Adding and removing data stores:
To turn on blended search for an app, you must connect at least two data
stores to it during app creation.
You can add or remove data stores from a blended search app, but the app
can't have fewer than two data stores connected to it at any time.
If you connect a single data store to a search app during app creation,
then you can't add or remove that data store.
Data stores that contain unstructured data imported using
BigQuery are not supported.
Blended search allows the following fields in
search requests :
boostSpec
contentSearchSpec
dataStoreSpecs
facetSpecs
filter
languageCode
offset
oneBoxPageSize
orderBy
query
pageSize
pageToken
relevanceScoreSpec
relevanceThreshold
session
sessionSpec
spellCorrectionSpec
userInfo
userPseudoId
Blended search allows the following fields in dataStoreSpecs :
dataStore
boostSpec : If there are boost specs specified for both SearchRequest
and dataStoreSpecs , both boost specs are applied to search results
filter : If there are filters specified for both SearchRequest and
dataStoreSpecs , both filters are applied to search results
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on serving configs are
supported for blended apps. Only the following fields can be added or updated
in a serving config:
boostControlIds
displayName
filterControlIds
genericConfig :
contentSearchSpec
name
solutionType
synonymsControlIds
CRUD operations on the following controls are supported for blended search apps:
boostAction
synonymAction
filterAction
There is a limit of 50 data stores per search app.
If one data store uses a CMEK configuration, all other data stores must also
use the same CMEK configuration.
