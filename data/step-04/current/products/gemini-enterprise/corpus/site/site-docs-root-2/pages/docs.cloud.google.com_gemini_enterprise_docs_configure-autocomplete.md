Configure autocomplete
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes Gemini Enterprise's basic autocomplete feature.
Autocomplete generates query suggestions based on the first few characters
entered for the query.
Caution: This version of autocomplete doesn't support third-party data
stores or apps with multiple data stores attached. Google recommends that
you use advanced autocomplete
instead.
For structured and unstructured data, by default, autocomplete
generates suggestions based on the content of documents in the data store.
After document import, by default, autocomplete doesn't start generating
suggestions until there is sufficient quality data, typically a couple of
days. If you make autocomplete requests through the API, autocomplete can
generate suggestions that are based on the search history or user events.
The query suggestions model determines what type of data autocomplete uses to
generate suggestions. There are four query suggestions models:
Document. The document model generates suggestions from
user-imported documents.
Completable Fields. The completable fields model suggests text taken
directly from structured data fields. Only those fields that are annotated
with completable are used for autocomplete suggestions. This model is only
available for structured data.
Search history. The search history model generates suggestions from the
history of SearchService.search API calls. Don't use
this model if there is no traffic available for the
servingConfigs.search method.
User event. The user event model generates suggestions from
user-imported search events.
Autocomplete requests are sent using the
dataStores.completeQuery method.
The following table shows the query suggestions model types available for each
data type.

* : The document schema must contain title or description fields, or there
must be fields that have been specified as title or description key
properties. See
Update a schema for structured data .
If you don't want to use the default model for your data type, you can
specify a different model when you send your autocomplete request. Autocomplete
requests are sent using the dataStores.completeQuery method. For
information, see API instructions: Send an autocomplete request to choose a
different model .
Autocomplete features
Gemini Enterprise supports the following autocomplete features to show
the most helpful predictions during search:
Feature
Description
Example or more information
Correct typos
Correct word spellings that are typos.
Milc → Milk .
Remove unsafe terms
Powered by Google Safe Search.
Remove inappropriate queries.
Supported in English ( en ), French ( fr ),
German ( de ), Italian ( it ), Polish
( pl ), Portuguese ( pt ), Russian ( ru ),
Spanish ( es ), and Ukrainian ( uk ).
Text that's offensive, such as porn, racy, vulgar, violence.
Prevent display of basic personally identifiable information (PII)
Powered by Sensitive Data Protection ,
Gemini Enterprise makes a reasonable effort to prevent
display of basic types of PII, such as phone numbers and email addresses.
If there is an email address
jeffersonloveshiking@gmail.com in the data store,
Gemini Enterprise won't return the email address as an
autocomplete suggestion if the user types jef
in the search bar.
To more thoroughly safeguard against PII leaks, Google recommends that
you apply your own Data Loss Protection (DLP) solution in
addition to the detectors that are provided by
Gemini Enterprise. For more information, see Protect against PII leaks .
Denylist
Remove terms that are listed in the denylist.
For more information, see Use an autocomplete denylist .
Deduplicate Terms
Powered by AI-driven semantic understanding.
For near-identical terms, either term matches, but only the more
popular one is suggested.
Shoes for Women , Womens Shoes , and Womans Shoes are deduplicated,
and only the most popular one is suggested.
Tail match suggestions
Not available in US and EU multi-regions.
Optional setting.
If there are no autocomplete matches for the entire query, suggest
matches for only the trailing word of the query.
Not available for healthcare search.
For more information, see Tail match suggestions .
Tail match suggestions
Tail match suggestions are made using exact prefix matching against the last
word in a query string.
For example, say the query "songs with he" is sent in an autocomplete request.
When tail matching is enabled, autocomplete might find that the full prefix
"songs with he" does not have any matches. However, the last word in the query,
"he", has an exact prefix match with "hello world" and "hello kitty". In that
case, the returned suggestions are "songs with hello world" and "songs with
hello kitty" because there are no full match suggestions.
You can use this feature to reduce empty suggestion results and increase
suggestion diversity, making this especially useful in cases where data sources
(user event count, search history, and document topic coverage) is limited.
However, enabling tail match suggestions can reduce the overall quality of
suggestions. Because tail match only matches the trailing word of the prefix,
some returned suggestions might not make sense. For example, a query such as
"songs with he" might get a tail match suggestion like "songs with helpers
guides".
Tail match suggestions are only returned if:
include_tail_suggestions is set to true in the
dataStores.completeQuery request.
There are no full prefix match suggestions for the query.
Protect against PII leaks
The definition of PII is broad, and PII
can be difficult to detect. As a result, Gemini Enterprise
can't guarantee that PII won't be returned in autocomplete suggestions.
Gemini Enterprise applies the
Sensitive Data Protection inspection
service to look for and block common types of PII from appearing as suggestions.
However, if your data stores contain PII or if you use the search history or
user events query suggestions models, review the following and take appropriate
action:
If the types of PII that you want to protect are fairly standard, such as
phone numbers and email addresses, begin by extensively testing autocomplete
suggestions for your app. Gemini Enterprise can't guarantee
that PII won't be returned in autocomplete suggestions.
If PII leaks are discovered during autocomplete testing or if you already
know that you have non-standard PII to protect (for example, proprietary user
IDs), then try adjusting the autocomplete threshold and content serving
parameters. For more information, see Reduce the risk of returning
suggestions that contain PII .
If adjusting the parameters isn't sufficient to prevent PII leaks, then
implement your own DLP solution. Customize the DLP solution for the types of
PII most likely to be found in your data stores, user events, or users'
search queries. You can use
Sensitive Data Protection or a
third-party DLP service. Take one of the following approaches:
Filter out PII before
you import the documents and user events in your data stores.
Review autocomplete suggestions before presenting suggestions to the user
at serving time and block the suggestions that contain any PII.
If you use the search history or user events model, add some informational
text on the search bar, telling your users not to put PII in their search
queries.
If you have questions or encounter particular challenges with blocking PII,
contact your customer engineer (CE) or Google account team.
Turn autocomplete on or off for a widget
To turn autocomplete on or off for a widget, follow these steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Gemini Enterprise page.
Gemini Enterprise
Click the name of the app that you want to edit.
Click Configurations .
Click the UI tab.
Toggle the Show autocomplete suggestions option to turn autocomplete
suggestions for the widget on or off. When you enable autocomplete,
expect to wait a day or two before suggestions start.
Update autocomplete settings
To configure the autocomplete settings in the UI, follow these steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Gemini Enterprise page.
Gemini Enterprise
Click the name of the app that you want to edit.
Click Configurations .
Click the Autocomplete tab.
Enter or select new values for the autocomplete settings you want to update:
Maximum number of suggestions: The maximum number of
autocomplete suggestions that can be offered for a query.
Minimum length to trigger: The minimum number of characters
that can be typed before autocomplete suggestions are offered.
Matching order : The location in a query string that
autocomplete can start matching its suggestions from.
Query suggestions model : The query suggestions model used to
generate the retrieved suggestions. This can be overridden in the
dataStores.completeQuery using the queryModel
parameter.
Enable autocomplete : By default, autocomplete doesn't start making
suggestions until it has sufficient quality data, typically a couple
of days. If you want to override this default and start getting some
autocomplete suggestions sooner, select Now .
Even when you select Now , it can take a day for suggestions to be
generated and still some autocomplete suggestions will be missing
or poor quality until there is sufficient good data.
Deny list : Import a denylist as a JSON file in a
Cloud Storage bucket.
For more information about the denylist constraints and specifications,
see Use an autocomplete denylist .
Click Save and publish. Changes take effect within a few minutes for
engines where autocomplete has already been turned on.
Reduce the risk of returning suggestions that contain PII
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
End users have all kinds of PII information, such as driver licenses and
telephone numbers, which they are supposed to keep private. But, any of this PII
information might be typed into the search bar by users looking for results that
are specific to themselves.
If you use the search history or user events model and there is a likelihood of
your users typing PII into the search bar, then you can reduce PII leaks by
adjusting the following parameters:
queryFrequencyThreshold : Before a query can be returned as an autocomplete
suggestion, it must have been entered this many times.
numUniqueUsersThreshold : Before a query can be returned as an autocomplete
suggestion, it must have been entered by this many unique users. The value
of the userPseudoId field in the search user event
determines if the user is unique.
Use case example
For example, take a case where users have account numbers that should
be kept private.
If the search history or user events suggestion model is in use, then these
account numbers, along with all the other terms that end users search for, are
used to generate suggestions. Thus, if user-A's account number YZ-46789A has
repeatedly been entered into the search bar and user-B has an account number of
YZ-42345B , when user-B types YZ-4 into the search bar, the autocomplete
suggestion returned might be user-A's account number.
To reduce the likelihood of this kind of leak happening, the
Gemini Enterprise administrator decides to:
Increase the value of the queryFrequencyThreshold parameter to 30 .
In this case, it is very unlikely for one account number to be entered so
often. However, popular search queries will be entered at least that often.
Increase the value of the numUniqueUsersThreshold parameter to 6 .
The administrator thinks it unlikely for the same account number to be
entered in the search bar in six search events each associated with
a different userPseudoId .
Procedure
There are two threshold parameters for autocomplete.
These parameters aren't available on the Google Cloud console but can be set with a
REST API call to the updateCompletionConfig
method.
Note: These parameters only apply to the search history and user events models.
To configure the autocomplete threshold settings, follow
these steps. Each step is optional, depending on the parameter you want to
change.
REST
Update the CompletionConfig.queryFrequencyThreshold field:
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID " \
https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID /completionConfig?updateMask = queryFrequencyThreshold \
-d '{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID /completionConfig",
"queryFrequencyThreshold": QUERY_FREQUENCY_THRESHOLD
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the number or ID of your Google Cloud project.
DATA_STORE_ID : the ID of the data store that is associated
with your app.
QUERY_FREQUENCY_THRESHOLD : an integer value that
indicates the minimum number of times that a search query must be
entered before it can be returned as an autocomplete suggestion. The
count is summed over a months-long, rolling, time window.
The default is 8 .
Example command and result
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \$ curl -X PATCH \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: my-project-123" \t-access-token)" \

Update the CompletionConfig.numUniqueUsersThreshold field:
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID " \
https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID /completionConfig?updateMask = numUniqueUsersThreshold \
-d '{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID /completionConfig",
"numUniqueUsersThreshold": UNIQUE_USERS
}'
Replace UNIQUE_USERS with an integer value that
represents the minimum number of unique users who must enter a given search
query before it can be returned as an autocomplete suggestion.
The count is summed over a months-long, rolling, time window.
The default is 3 .
Example command and result
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \

Use an autocomplete denylist
You can use a denylist to prevent specific terms from appearing as autocomplete
suggestions.
For example, take a pharmaceutical company. If a medication is no longer
FDA-approved but is mentioned in documents in their data store, they might want
to prevent that medication from appearing as a suggested query. The company
could add the name of that medication to a denylist to prevent it from being
suggested.
The following limits apply:
One denylist per data store
Uploading a denylist overwrites any existing denylist for that data store
Up to 1000 terms per denylist
Terms are case-insensitive
After importing a denylist, it takes 1-2 days to take effect
Each entry of your denylist consists of a blockPhrase and matchOperator :
blockPhrase : Enter a string as your denylist term. Terms are
case-insensitive.
matchOperator : Accepts the following values:
EXACT_MATCH : Prevents an exact match of the denylist term from appearing
as a suggested query.
CONTAINS : Prevents any suggestion that contains the denylist term from
appearing.
The following is an example of a denylist with four entries:
{
"entries" : [
{ "blockPhrase" : "Oranges" , "matchOperator" : "CONTAINS" },
{ "blockPhrase" : "bAd apples" , "matchOperator" : "EXACT_MATCH" },
{ "blockPhrase" : "Cool as A Cucumber" , "matchOperator" : "EXACT_MATCH" },
{ "blockPhrase" : "cherry pick" , "matchOperator" : "CONTAINS" }
]
}
Before importing a denylist, verify that the necessary access
controls are set for Discovery Engine editor
access.
Denylists can be imported either from local JSON data or
from Cloud Storage . To remove a denylist from a data store,
purge the denylist .
Import a denylist from local JSON data
To import a denylist from a local JSON file containing your denylist, do the following:
Create your denylist in a local JSON file with the following format. Make
sure each denylist entry is in a new line with no line breaks.
{
"inlineSource" : {
"entries" : [
{ "blockPhrase" : " TERM_1 " , "matchOperator" : " MATCH_OPERATOR_1 " },
{ "blockPhrase" : " TERM_2 " , "matchOperator" : " MATCH_OPERATOR_2 " }
]
}
}
Make a POST request to the
suggestionDenyListEntries:import method, providing the name
of your JSON file.
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
--data @ DENYLIST_FILE \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID /suggestionDenyListEntries:import"
Replace the following:
DENYLIST_FILE : the local path of the JSON file
containing the denylist terms.
PROJECT_ID : the number or ID of your Google Cloud project.
DATA_STORE_ID : the ID of the data store that is
associated with your app.
After importing your denylist, it takes 1-2 days to start filtering suggestions.
Import a denylist from Cloud Storage
To import a denylist from a JSON file in Cloud Storage, do the following:
Create your denylist in a JSON file with the following format and import to
a Cloud Storage bucket. Make sure each denylist entry is in a new line
with no line breaks.
{ "blockPhrase" : " TERM_1 " , "matchOperator" : " MATCH_OPERATOR_1 " }
{ "blockPhrase" : " TERM_2 " , "matchOperator" : " MATCH_OPERATOR_2 " }
Create a local JSON file containing the gcsSource object. Use
this to point to your denylist file's location in a Cloud Storage
bucket.
{
"gcsSource" : {
"inputUris" : [ " DENYLIST_STORAGE_LOCATION " ]
}
}
Replace DENYLIST_STORAGE_LOCATION with the
location of your denylist in Cloud Storage. You can enter only one
URI. The URI must be entered in this format:
gs:// BUCKET / FILE_PATH .
Make a POST request to the
suggestionDenyListEntries:import method, including the
gcsSource object.
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
--data @ GCS_SOURCE_FILE \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID /suggestionDenyListEntries:import"
Replace the following:
GCS_SOURCE_FILE : the local path of the file containing
the gcsSource object that points to your denylist.
PROJECT_ID : the number or ID of your Google Cloud project.
DATA_STORE_ID : the ID of the data store that is
associated with your app.
After importing your denylist, it takes 1-2 days to start filtering suggestions.
Purge a denylist
To purge a denylist from your data store, do the following:
Make a POST request to the suggestionDenyListEntries:purge
method.
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID /suggestionDenyListEntries:purge"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the number or ID of your Google Cloud project.
DATA_STORE_ID : the ID of the data store that is
associated with your app.
Use an imported list of autocomplete suggestions
You can choose to provide your own list of autocomplete suggestions instead of
using autocomplete suggestions generated from an autocomplete data model.
Caution: For imported suggestions, the text is displayed exactly as in the list.
No spell check, SafeSearch
filters, or deduplication are applied.
For most applications, using generated suggestions from one of autocomplete data
models yields better results. However, there might be some rare situations
where the model's suggestions don't match your needs and providing a discrete
list of suggestions gives your users a better autocomplete experience.
For example, a small online bookstore imports their list of book titles as the
autocomplete suggestions. When a customer begins to type in the search bar, the
autocomplete suggestion will always be a book title from the imported list. When
the list of books changes, the bookstore purges the current list and imports the
new list. An excerpt from the list might look something like:
{ "suggestion" : "Wuthering Heights" , "globalScore" : "0.52" },
{ "suggestion" : "The Time Machine" , "globalScore" : "0.26" },
{ "suggestion" : "Nicholas Nickleby" , "globalScore" : "0.38" },
{ "suggestion" : "A Little Princess" , "globalScore" : "0.71" },
{ "suggestion" : "The Scarlet Letter" , "globalScore" : "0.32" }
The globalScore is a floating point number in the range [0, 1] that's used
to rank the suggestion. Alternatively, you can use a frequency score which is
an integer greater than one. The frequency score is used to rank suggestions
when the globalScore is not available (set as null).
Note: Even though in the data, you could just provide one score (either
globalScore or frequency ), in the following steps to create a
BigQuery table, both globalScore and frequency is a must-have in
the schema. Incorrect schema will lead to suggestions importation failure.
Before you begin
To import autocomplete suggestions, you need the
Discovery Engine Admin IAM role, which includes the
discoveryengine.completionSuggestions.import permission.
For more information, see IAM roles and
permissions .
Set up and import autocomplete suggestions
To set up and import a list of autocomplete suggestions from a
BigQuery, follow these steps:
Create your list of suggestions and load it into a BigQuery table.
At minimum you need to provide each suggestion as a string and either a
global score or a frequency.
Use the following table schema for your list of suggestions:
[
{
"description" : "The suggestion text" ,
"mode" : "REQUIRED" ,
"name" : "suggestion" ,
"type" : "STRING"
},
{
"description" : "Global score of this suggestion. Control how this suggestion would be scored and ranked. Set global score or frequency; not both." ,
"mode" : "NULLABLE" ,
"name" : "globalScore" ,
"type" : "FLOAT"
},
{
"description" : "Frequency of this suggestion. Used to rank suggestions when the global score is not available." ,
"mode" : "NULLABLE" ,
"name" : "frequency" ,
"type" : "INTEGER"
}
]
See the BigQuery documentation for instructions on
how to create a BigQuery table and load the
table with your autocomplete suggestion list.
Import the list from BigQuery.
Make a POST request to the
completionSuggestions:import method, including
the bigquerySource object.
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID " \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID /completionSuggestions:import" \
-d '{
"bigquery_source": {"project_id": " PROJECT_ID_SOURCE ", "dataset_id": " DATASET_ID ", "table_id": " TABLE_ID "}
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the number or ID of your Google Cloud project.
DATA_STORE_ID : the ID of the data store.
PROJECT_ID_SOURCE : the project that contains
the dataset that you want to import.
DATASET_ID : the dataset ID for the suggestion
list that you want to import
TABLE_ID : the table ID for the suggestion
list that you want to import
Example command and result
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: my-project-123" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project-123/locations/global/dataStores/my-data-store/completionSuggestions:import" \
-d '{
"bigquery_source": {"project_id": "my-project-123", "dataset_id": "autocomplete", "table_id": "import_suggestion2"}
}'
{
"name": "projects/123456/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/my-data-store/operations/import-completion-suggestion-7659310803143180509",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.ImportCompletionSuggestionsMetadata"
}
}
Optional: Make note of the name value returned, and follow the
instructions in Get details about a long-running
operation to see when the import operation is complete.
If you haven't enabled autocomplete for the app, follow the procedure
Update autocomplete settings . Make sure to set
Enable autocomplete to Now .
Wait a couple of days for indexing to complete and the imported suggestions
to become available.
Send an autocomplete request
To send an autocomplete request that returns an imported suggestion instead of a
suggestion from an autocomplete model:
Follow the procedure to send an autocomplete request to a different
model and set
QUERY_SUGGESTIONS_MODEL to imported-suggestion .
Example command and result
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: my-project-123" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project-123/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/my-data-store:completeQuery?query=t&query_model=imported-suggestion"
Response:
{
"querySuggestions": [
{
"suggestion": "The Time Machine"
},
{
"suggestion": "The Scarlet Letter"
}
]
}
Purge the list of imported autocomplete suggestions
Before importing a new list of autocomplete suggestions, remove the existing
one.
To purge an existing list of autocomplete suggestions, follow this step:
Make a POST request to the
completionSuggestions:purge method.
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID /completionSuggestions:purge"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the number or ID of your Google Cloud project.
DATA_STORE_ID : the ID of the data store that is
associated with your app.
Example command and result
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: my-project-123" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project-123/locations/global/dataStores/my-data-store/completionSuggestions:purge"
