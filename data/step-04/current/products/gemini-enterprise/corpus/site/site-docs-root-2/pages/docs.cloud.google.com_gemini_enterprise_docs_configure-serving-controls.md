Configure serving controls
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Serving controls (also called controls) change the default
behavior of how a request is served when results are returned. Serving controls
act at a data-store level.
For example, controls can boost and bury results, filter entries from returned
results, associate strings with each other as synonyms, or redirect results to
specified URIs.
About serving controls
To change the results of a request, first create a serving control. Then, attach
that control to the serving config of an app. A
serving config configures
metadata that's used to generate serving time results, such as search results or
answers. A serving control only affects requests served by the app if the
control is attached to the app's serving config.
Some controls, such as boost controls, have dependencies on data stores. If a
data store is removed from an app, then any data store-dependent controls are
also removed from that app and become inactive, but are not deleted.
Serving control types
The following types of serving controls are available:
Control
Description
Available for
Boost control
Changes the returned order of results
Search apps with data stores that support a schema, such as data stores that contain structured data or unstructured data with metadata
Filter control
Removes entries from returned results
Search apps with data stores that support a schema, such as data stores that contain structured data or unstructured data with metadata
Synonyms control
Associates queries with each other
Search apps with structured or unstructured data stores
Redirect control
Redirects to a specified URI
All search apps
Promote control
Promotes a specified link for a query
Search apps with structured or unstructured data stores
About conditions
When creating a control, you can optionally define a condition that determines
when the control is applied. Conditions are defined using condition fields. The
following condition fields are available:
queryTerms . An optional control that's applied when specific queries are
searched for. When the queryTerms condition is used, the control
is applied when the value of queryTerms matches a term in
SearchRequest.query . Query terms can only be used when the
Control.searchUseCase is set as SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH . Up to 10 different
queryTerms can be specified on a single Control.condition . If no query
terms are specified, the queryTerms field is ignored.
To successfully create a promote control, you must specify the queryTerms
field with fullMatch set to true or false .
activeTimeRange . An optional control that's applied when a request
occurs within a specified time range. It checks that the time a request was
received is between activeTimeRange.startTime and activeTimeRange.endTime .
Up to 10 activeTimeRange ranges can be specified on a single
Control.condition . If the activeTimeRange field isn't specified, the field
is ignored.
If multiple conditions are specified for a control, the control is applied
to the search request when both condition types are satisfied. If multiple
values for the same condition are specified, only one of the values needs to
match for that condition to be satisfied.
For example, consider the following condition with two query terms specified:
"queryTerms" : [
{
"value" : "gShoe" ,
"fullMatch" : true
},
{
"value" : "gBoot" ,
"fullMatch" : true
}
]
The condition will be satisfied for a request with
SearchRequest.query="gShoe" or a request with SearchRequest.query="gBoot" ,
but won't be satisfied with SearchRequest.query="gSandal" or any other
string.
If no conditions are specified, the control is always applied.
For more information, see the Condition field in the API
reference.
Create and attach boost serving controls
A boost serving control reorders the results by promoting or demoting them based
on the applied conditions. Boost works by applying a multiplying factor to the
ranking of a document that meets the boost conditions.
Use the following instructions to create a boost serving control.
Console
To create and attach a boost control using the Google Cloud console, do the
following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Gemini Enterprise page.
Gemini Enterprise
Select the app for which you want to create the boost control.
Click Configurations and then click the Control tab.
Click Create control .
For What do you want to do? , specify the control name and type:
For Control name , enter a name for your boost/bury control.
For Control Type , select Boost/bury .
Click Continue .
For Set Rule Scope & Impact , define the actions that you want
to trigger with this control:
Select a data store from the list. If you want the action to be
applied to multiple data stores, create a control for each data store.
For Filter , add a filter.
This is a string specifying requirements that must be
met by the document. Only if the document matches all the
requirements, the boost condition is applied. Otherwise, there is no
change. If you don't specify a filter, then the boost is applied to
all documents in the data store.
For information about the filtering syntax, see Filter expression
syntax .
For Boost/bury value , select a boost/bury value in the range
[-1, 1] using the slider. The slider moves in steps of 0.01.
Click Continue .
For Optional: When This Rule Activates , set the following conditions that
trigger the control. If no conditions are configured, the control is always
in effect:
Add Partial match query terms . The control takes effect when these
query terms match partially.
Add Exact match query terms . The control takes effect when these query
terms match exactly.
To add an active time range, click Add time range and set
Start Time 1 and End Time 1 . This defines the window when the
condition is active. You can add a maximum of 10 time ranges.
Click Continue .
For Additional settings , choose if you want to activate the rule:
If you don't want to activate this control as soon as it's created, turn off Publish this control immediately .
Click Continue .
Click Submit .

use the control. Must be a UTF-8 encoded string with length [1,128].
USE_CASE : must be either SEARCH_USE_CASE_SEARCH or
SEARCH_USE_CASE_BROWSE . If SEARCH_USE_CASE_BROWSE is specified,
then Condition.queryTerms can't be used in the condition.
CONDITION : an optional field that defines when the
control should be applied. Contains the following fields:
VALUE : the specific query value to match
against. It's a lowercase UTF-8 string with length [1, 5000] . If
FULL_MATCH_1 is true , this field can have at
most three space-separated terms.
FULL_MATCH : a boolean that indicates whether
the search query needs to exactly match the query term. When set to
true , it requires SearchRequest.query to completely match the
queryTerm.value . When set to false , it requires
SearchRequest.query to contain queryTerm.value as a substring.
START_TIMESTAMP : a timestamp in RFC 3339 UTC
"Zulu" format to indicate the start of a time range.
END_TIMESTAMP : a timestamp in RFC 3339 UTC
"Zulu" format to indicate the end of a time range.
BOOST_VALUE :
a floating point number in the range [-1,1]. When the value is
negative, results are demoted (they appear lower down in the
results). When the value is positive, results are promoted
(they appear higher up in the results).
For more information, see
boostAction .
FILTER : a string specifying requirements that must
be met by the document. If the document matches all the requirements, the
boost is applied. Otherwise there is no change. If this field is empty, then
the boost is applied to all documents in the data store. For the filtering
syntax, see Filter expression syntax .
Note: The document field title can't be filtered.

Response
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/ APP_ID /controls/ PROMOTE_CONTROL_ID ",
"displayName": " PROMOTE_CONTROL_NAME ",
"solutionType": "SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH",
"conditions": [
{
"queryTerms": [
{
"value": " VALUE ",
"fullMatch": true
}
]
}
],
"useCases": [
"SEARCH_USE_CASE_SEARCH"
],
"promoteAction": {
"dataStore": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/ DATA_STORE_ID ",
"searchLinkPromotion": {
"title": " URI_TITLE ",
"uri": " URI ",
"description": " URI_DESCRIPTION ",
"enabled": ENABLED_TRUE|FALSE
}
}
}
The response contains promotion control IDs that you need to attach your
promote control to your search app.
Attach the control to the app's serving config using the
engines.servingConfigs.patch method. The order in which you
attach the promoteControlIds in the following request is the order in
which the promoted results are returned.
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID " \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/ APP_ID /servingConfigs/default_search?update_mask=promote_control_ids" \
-d '{
"promoteControlIds": [" PROMOTE_ID_1 ", " PROMOTE_ID_2 "]
}'
Replace
PROMOTE_ID_N with the control IDs that you
received in the previous step.
