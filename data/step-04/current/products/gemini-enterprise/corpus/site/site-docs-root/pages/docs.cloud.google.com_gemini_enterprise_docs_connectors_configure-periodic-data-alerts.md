Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to view the status, activity logs, and sync activity of a third-party data store, and how to configure alerts for the data store.
View data store details and status
After connecting your third-party data source to Gemini Enterprise by
creating a data store, you can view the status of the data store by going to the
Data stores page and clicking the data store name.
The data store console
View data store states
The Connector state field shows the status of the data store. See the
following table for information about possible data store states.

[Action required]
User actions that must be completed before the data store can start syncing data.
Updating
The data store is being updated.

View data store sync activity
In the Data Ingestion Activity tab, you can see the data store's latest sync
activity. Each sync run is listed, with the following fields:
Connector run : the date and time of the sync run.
Status : the status of the sync run.
Last update time : the date and time of the last change in the sync run.
Sync type : the type of sync ( Full or Incremental ).
Items succeeded (%) : the percentage of entities that were successfully
synced.
Items failed : the number of entities that failed to sync.
Details : More information about the sync run. If there are more details
available, you can click to expand the field and view them.
For information about the possible values of the Status field for a sync
run, see the following table.

details page.
View logs for all data store sync activity
This shows you all logs related to this data store, across all
sync runs, including all entity sync runs.
Set up alerts for sync events
After connecting your third-party data source to Gemini Enterprise
by creating a data store, you can enable alerts for predefined tasks.
Alert notifications can be emailed to selected recipients.
Note: You can't configure alerts for a federated search connector.
Before you begin
To enable alerts for a data store, you need to have the following permissions or
role assigned to you:
Permissions
discoveryengine.googleapis.com/alertPolicies.get
discoveryengine.googleapis.com/dataConnectors.update
Predefined role
Discovery Engine User
Enable alerts for a data source
To enable alerts for a specific data source:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Gemini Enterprise page.
Gemini Enterprise
In the navigation menu, click Data stores .
Click the name of the data store that you want the alerts configured.
On the data store details page, ensure that
you have enabled the Full sync frequency and the Incremental sync frequency .
Click the Alerts tab and then click Edit .
In the Configure alerts section, click the alert toggle to the on
position. The following alerts are supported:
Alert Type
Description
Status: Failed/Cancelled
The data store failed to connect or retrieve data from your data
source, or the sync run was cancelled.
Status: Succeeded
The data store successfully connected and retrieved data from
your data source.
In the Configure recipients section, add the email addresses that must
receive notifications for the enabled alerts.
Note: Alert recipients are configured at the Google Cloud project level. If
you add an email address to receive alert notifications for one data store,
that email address also receives the alert notifications from the other data
stores in your project.
