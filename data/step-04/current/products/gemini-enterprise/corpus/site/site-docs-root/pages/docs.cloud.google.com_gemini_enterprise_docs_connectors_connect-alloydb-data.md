Connect to data from AlloyDB for PostgreSQL (Preview)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Preview: You need to be on the allowlist to use this connector. To be added to the allowlist, contact your account team or the
sales team .
You can connect your AlloyDB instance to
Gemini Enterprise, enabling live access to your data.
Compared to importing from AlloyDB, connecting has the
following advantages:
Avoids the need for importing, indexing, and duplicating data.
Maximal data freshness.
No additional indexing and storage costs.
No need to flatten structured data into uniform records.
Consider the following disadvantages of connecting compared to importing:
This approach supports only structured queries, not semantic or
semi-semantic queries.
The setup is slightly more involved compared to importing the data.
Limitations
Connecting to AlloyDB has the following limitations:
Gemini Enterprise supports access control on the level of database
objects, such as tables and columns, but not on a per-user level. All users
with access to your Gemini Enterprise app can see the same data.
Creating an AlloyDB data store is supported through
the API, not through the Google Cloud console.
Before you begin
Connecting to AlloyDB is in
Preview with an allowlist. To use this
feature, sign up with the following form:
Opt-in/Opt-out to use Gemini Enterprise and connect to data from AlloyDB
After signing up, wait until you receive the enablement confirmation before
following the instructions on this page.
Set up AlloyDB AI natural language
This connector relies on AlloyDB AI natural language
in AlloyDB, which translates natural language queries
into SQL queries.
Before connecting, set up AlloyDB AI natural language in your
database using the steps in Generate SQL queries that answer natural language
questions in the
AlloyDB documentation.
Note that adding templates in AlloyDB AI natural language (a
curated set of natural language questions with corresponding SQL queries) is
particularly useful for quality. When adding templates, Google recommends the
following:
Use ORDER BY to avoid non-determinism. For example: SELECT customers.id
FROM customers ORDER BY customers.id; .
Note: You can add templates and other context later. For example,
when you notice low answer quality in Gemini Enterprise for
a specific question.
Set up authentication between Gemini Enterprise and AlloyDB
Gemini Enterprise accesses AlloyDB using a
dedicated service account and a database user in your
AlloyDB instance. With this approach, every
Gemini Enterprise user can see the same data, without user-specific access
control.
A service account is used to connect and interact with your
AlloyDB instance. To enable this, you need to
configure the Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings in the Google Cloud project
where your database instance resides.
To set up authentication, do the following:
Navigate to the IAM configuration page of the project that
hosts your AlloyDB instance.
Grant the Cloud AlloyDB Database User role to
the following principal:
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-discoveryengine.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with the Google Cloud project number where you use
Gemini Enterprise.
In your AlloyDB instance, create a DB user to be
used by Gemini Enterprise to execute SQL queries.
It is very important that you grant this user read-only access and only for
tables, views and columns that should be accessible from
Gemini Enterprise. This ensures that:
Queries from Gemini Enterprise cannot change or delete your data.
Gemini Enterprise is designed to only read data from your database
and not change anything, but Google can't fully exclude the possibility
that the AI might generate unintended write-queries.
Users in Gemini Enterprise can only see data they are supposed to
see.
For example:
CREATE ROLE USER_NAME WITH LOGIN PASSWORD ' PASSWORD ' ;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "public" . " TABLE_NAME_1 " TO USER_NAME ;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "public" . " TABLE_NAME_2 " TO USER_NAME ;
When linking Gemini Enterprise with
AlloyDB, provide the username and
password in the User and Password fields of
alloydbConnectionConfig .
Link Gemini Enterprise with AlloyDB
To connect your AlloyDB instance, follow these steps:
Create a data store in Gemini Enterprise with your
AlloyDB connection details using the API, including
federatedSearchConfig.alloyDbConfig .
The following example:
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID " \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /collections/default_collection/dataStores?dataStoreId= DATA_STORE_ID " -d '{
"displayName": " DATA_STORE_NAME ",
"federatedSearchConfig": {
"alloyDbConfig": {
"alloydbConnectionConfig": {
"instance": " INSTANCE_PATH ",
"database": " DATABASE_NAME ",
"user": " DATABASE_USER_NAME ",
"password": " DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD ",
"authMode": "AUTH_MODE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
},
"alloydb_ai_nl_config": { "nlConfigId": " NL_CONFIG_ID " }
}
},
"industryVertical": "GENERIC",
"solutionTypes": ["SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH"]
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your project where you use
Gemini Enterprise.
LOCATION : The location of your data store. This
should be the same location as your Gemini Enterprise instance.
Important: For locations other than global , replace discoveryengine
with the location-specific path. For more information, see Gemini Enterprise
locations .
DATA_STORE_ID : the ID of the data store that you want to create. This ID can contain only lowercase letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.
DATA_STORE_NAME : the display name of the data store that you want to create.
INSTANCE_PATH : The path of your
AlloyDB instance, in the format
projects/.../locations/.../clusters/.../instances/... .
DATABASE_NAME : the ID of the
AlloyDB database.
DATABASE_USER_NAME : the ID of the
AlloyDB database user.
DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD : the password of the
AlloyDB database user.
NL_CONFIG_ID : the ID of the
AlloyDB AI natural language configuration.
Attach your data store to an existing Gemini Enterprise app, or create
a new app and select your connector, following the steps in
Create an app .
