Handle API errors
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Calendar API returns two levels of error information:
HTTP error codes and messages in the header
A JSON object in the response body with additional details that can help you
determine how to handle the error.
The rest of this page provides a reference of Calendar errors, with some
guidance on how to handle them in your app.
We strongly recommend
testing
error handling of your application in a real environment.
Implement exponential backoff
The
Cloud APIs documentation
has a good explanation of exponential backoff and how to use it with the Google
APIs.
Errors & suggested actions
This section provides the complete JSON representation of each listed
error and suggested actions you might take to handle it.
400: Bad Request
User error. This can mean that a required field or parameter has not been
provided, the value supplied is invalid, or the combination of provided fields
is invalid.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "calendar",
"reason": "timeRangeEmpty",
"message": "The specified time range is empty.",
"locationType": "parameter",
"location": "timeMax",
}
],
"code": 400,
"message": "The specified time range is empty."
}
}
Suggested action: Because this is a permanent error, do not retry.
Read the error message instead and change your request accordingly.
401: Invalid Credentials
Invalid authorization header.
The access token you're using is either expired or invalid.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "global",
"reason": "authError",
"message": "Invalid Credentials",
"locationType": "header",
"location": "Authorization",
}
],
"code": 401,
"message": "Invalid Credentials"
}
}
Suggested actions:
Get a new access token using the long-lived refresh token.
If this fails, direct the user through the OAuth flow, as described in
Authorizing requests with OAuth 2.0 .
If you are seeing this for a service account, check that you have
successfully completed all the steps in the
service account page .
403: User Rate Limit Exceeded
One of the limits from the Developer Console has been reached.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "usageLimits",
"reason": "userRateLimitExceeded",
"message": "User Rate Limit Exceeded"
}
],
"code": 403,
"message": "User Rate Limit Exceeded"
}
}
Suggested actions:
Make sure your app follows best practices from
manage quotas .
Raise the per-user quota in the Developer Console project.
If one user is making a lot of requests on behalf of many users of a
Google Workspace account, consider
using a service account with domain-wide delegation
and setting the quotaUser parameter.
Use exponential backoff .
403: Rate Limit Exceeded
The user has reached Google Calendar API's maximum request rate per calendar
or per authenticated user.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "usageLimits",
"reason": "rateLimitExceeded",
"message": "Rate Limit Exceeded"
}
],
"code": 403,
"message": "Rate Limit Exceeded"
}
}
Suggested action: rateLimitExceeded errors can return either 403 or 429
error codes—currently they are functionally similar and should be responded to
in the same way, by using exponential backoff .
Additionally make sure your app follows best practices from
manage quotas .
403: Calendar usage limits exceeded
The user reached one of the Google Calendar limits in place to protect Google
users and infrastructure from abusive behavior.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "usageLimits",
"message": "Calendar usage limits exceeded.",
"reason": "quotaExceeded"
}
],
"code": 403,
"message": "Calendar usage limits exceeded."
}
}
Suggested actions:
Read more on the Calendar usage limits in the
Google Workspace Administrator help .
403: Forbidden for non-organizer
The event update request is attempting to set one of the shared event properties
in a copy that isn't the organizer's. Shared properties (for example,
guestsCanInviteOthers , guestsCanModify , or guestsCanSeeOtherGuests ) can
only be set by the organizer.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "calendar",
"reason": "forbiddenForNonOrganizer",
"message": "Shared properties can only be changed by the organizer of the event."
}
],
"code": 403,
"message": "Shared properties can only be changed by the organizer of the event."
}
}
Suggested actions:
If you're using Events: insert ,
Events: import , or
Events: update , and your request doesn't include
any shared properties, this is equivalent to trying to set them to their
default values. Consider using Events: patch
instead.
If your request has shared properties, make sure that you're only trying to
change these properties if you're updating the organizer's copy.
404: Not Found
The specified resource was not found. This can happen in several cases.
Here are some examples:
when the requested resource (with the provided ID) has never existed
when accessing a calendar that the user can not access
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "global",
"reason": "notFound",
"message": "Not Found"
}
],
"code": 404,
"message": "Not Found"
}
}
Suggested action: Use exponential backoff .
409: The requested identifier already exists
An instance with the given ID already exists in the storage.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "global",
"reason": "duplicate",
"message": "The requested identifier already exists."
}
],
"code": 409,
"message": "The requested identifier already exists."
}
}
Suggested action:
Generate a new ID if you want to create a new instance, otherwise use the
update method call.
409: Conflict
A batched item inside an
events.batch
operation can't be executed due to an operational conflict with other requested
batched items.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "global",
"reason": "conflict",
"message": "Conflict"
}
],
"code": 409,
"message": "Conflict"
}
}
Suggested action: Exclude all successfully finished and all definitely
failed batched items and retry the remaining ones in a different events.batch
or corresponding single event operations.
410: Gone
The syncToken or updatedMin parameters are no longer valid. This error can also
occur if a request attempts to delete an event that has already been deleted.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "calendar",
"reason": "fullSyncRequired",
"message": "Sync token is no longer valid, a full sync is required.",
"locationType": "parameter",
"location": "syncToken",
}
],
"code": 410,
"message": "Sync token is no longer valid, a full sync is required."
}
}
or
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "calendar",
"reason": "updatedMinTooLongAgo",
"message": "The requested minimum modification time lies too far in the past.",
"locationType": "parameter",
"location": "updatedMin",
}
],
"code": 410,
"message": "The requested minimum modification time lies too far in the past."
}
}
or
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "global",
"reason": "deleted",
"message": "Resource has been deleted"
}
],
"code": 410,
"message": "Resource has been deleted"
}
}
Suggested action: For the syncToken or updatedMin parameters, wipe the
store and re-sync. For more details see
Synchronize Resources Efficiently .
For already deleted events, no further action is necessary.
412: Precondition Failed
The etag supplied in the If-match header no longer corresponds to the current
etag of the resource.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "global",
"reason": "conditionNotMet",
"message": "Precondition Failed",
"locationType": "header",
"location": "If-Match",
}
],
"code": 412,
"message": "Precondition Failed"
}
}
Suggested action: Re-fetch the entity and re-apply the changes. For more details
see Get specific versions of resources .
429: Too many requests
A rateLimitExceeded error occurs when the user has sent too many requests in a
given amount of time.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "usageLimits",
"reason": "rateLimitExceeded",
"message": "Rate Limit Exceeded"
}
],
"code": 429,
"message": "Rate Limit Exceeded"
}
}
Suggested action: rateLimitExceeded errors can return either 403 or 429
error codes—currently they are functionally similar and should be responded to
in the same way, by using exponential backoff .
Additionally make sure your app follows best practices from
manage quotas .
500: Backend Error
An unexpected error occurred while processing the request.
{
"error": {
"errors": [
{
"domain": "global",
"reason": "backendError",
"message": "Backend Error",
}
],
"code": 500,
"message": "Backend Error"
}
}
Suggested action: Use exponential backoff .
