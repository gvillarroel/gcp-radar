Manage focus time, out of office, and working location events
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to use the Google Calendar API to create events that show
the status of Google Calendar users. Status events describe where users are or
what they're doing, including whether they're in focus time, out of office, or
working from a certain location.
In Google Calendar, users can create focus time, out of office and working
location events to indicate their custom status and location. These features are
only available on primary calendars, and to some Google Calendar users.
For more details, go to Use focus time in Google
Calendar
and Turn working location on or off for
users .
Read and list Calendar status events
You can read and list Calendar status events in the
Events resource of the
Calendar API.
To read a status event, use the
events.get method, specifying the
eventId of the event.
To list status events, use the
events.list method, specifying one
or more of the following values in the
eventTypes field:
'focusTime'
'outOfOffice'
'workingLocation'
Then, in the returned Event objects, inspect that the
eventType field has the
requested value, and refer to the corresponding field for details about the
status created by the user in Google Calendar:
focusTimeProperties
outOfOfficeProperties
workingLocationProperties
Subscribe to changes on status events
You can subscribe to changes on status events in the
Events resource of the
Calendar API.
Use the
events.watch method, specifying the
calendarId of the
Calendar to subscribe to and one or more of the following values in the
eventTypes field:
'focusTime'
'outOfOffice'
'workingLocation'
Create and update Calendar status events
To create a status event, you create an instance of the
Events resource using the
events.insert method, setting the
required fields for the event type.
If you update the status event using
events.update method, the event
must maintain the required fields.
Create focus time
To create a focus time event:
Set eventType to
'focusTime' .
Include the
focusTimeProperties
field.
Set the transparency
field to 'opaque' .
Set the event's start and
end fields to be a timed event
(with start and end times specified).
Focus times cannot be all-day events.
For feature details, go to Use focus time in Google
Calendar
Create out of office
To create an out of office event:
Set eventType to
'outOfOffice' .
Include the
outOfOfficeProperties
field.
Set the transparency
field to 'opaque' .
Set the event's start and
end fields to be a timed event
(with start and end times specified).
Out of office events cannot be all-day events.
For feature details, go to Show when you're out of
office
Create working location
To create a working location event:
Set eventType to
'workingLocation' .
Include the
workingLocationProperties
field.
Set the visibility field
to 'public' .
Set the transparency
field to 'transparent' .
Set the event's start and
end fields to be either:
A timed event (with start and end times specified);
An all-day event (with start and end dates specified) which spans
exactly one day.
All-day working location events cannot span multiple days, but timed events
can.
The following fields are optional but recommended for the best user experience
when inserting an
officeLocation :
workingLocationProperties.officeLocation.buildingId :
This should match a buildingId in the organization's
resources
database. This helps users benefit from all Calendar features, for example
room suggestions.
workingLocationProperties.officeLocation.label :
This is the label that's shown on the Calendar Web and mobile clients. You
can fetch building IDs and building labels using the
resources.buildings.list
method.
Creating and updating working location events through the batch endpoints isn't
supported.
For feature details, go to Set your working hours &
location
and Turn working location on or off for
users
How to show overlapping working location events
A user can have multiple working location events on their calendar at the same
time which overlap, meaning that any given time could have multiple working
locations set for it. In circumstances when only a single location can be shown
to the user, they should be shown that location consistently across multiple
applications. When doing this, use the following guidelines to choose which
event to show:
Timed events take
precedence over all-day events.
Single events take precedence over recurring events and their
exceptions .
Events which start later take precedence over events which start earlier.
Events with shorter durations take precedence over those with longer
durations.
More recently created events take precedence over events that were created
earlier.
Partially overlapping events should be shown as two different events each
with their own working location.
Create status events in Google Apps Script
Google Apps Script is a JavaScript-based cloud
scripting language that lets you build business applications that integrate with
Google Workspace. Scripts are developed in a browser-based code editor, and
they are stored and run on Google's servers. See also Google Apps Script
quickstart to start using
Apps Script to send requests to the Google Calendar API.
The following instructions describe how to manage status events using the
Google Calendar API as an advanced service in
Google Apps Script. For a complete list of Google Calendar API resources and methods,
see the reference documentation .
Create and set up the script
Create a script by going to
script.google.com/create .
On the left pane next to Services , click Add a service
add .
Select Google Calendar API and click Add .
After enabled, the API appears on the left pane. Available methods and
classes in the API can be listed using the Calendar keyword in the editor.
(Optional) Update the Google Cloud project
Each Google Apps Script project has an associated Google Cloud project. Your
script can use the default project that Google Apps Script automatically
creates. If you want to use a custom Google Cloud project, take the following steps
to update the project associated with your script.
On the left side of the editor, click Project Settings
settings .
Under Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project , click Change project .
Enter the project number of the Google Cloud project that's in the Developer
Preview Program, and click Set project .
On the left side, select Editor code to
navigate back to the code editor.
Add code to the script
The following code sample shows how to create, read, and list status events
on your primary calendar.
Paste the following into the code editor.
primary is a keyword to access the primary
calendar of the signed-in user. To retrieve events on a different calendar,
set the calendarId parameter to an email address. This lets you
read status events on the calendars of other users you have at minimum
free/busy access to. Secondary calendars can't have status events.

Run the code sample
Above the code editor, select the function to run from the drop-down menu,
and click Run .
In the first execution, it prompts you to authorize access. Review and allow
Apps Script to access your calendar.
You can inspect the results of the script execution in the
Execution Log that appears at the bottom of the window.
