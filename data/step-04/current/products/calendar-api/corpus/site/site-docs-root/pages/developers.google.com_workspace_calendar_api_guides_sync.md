Synchronize resources efficiently
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide describes how to
implement "incremental synchronization" of calendar data. Using this
method, you can keep data for all calendar collections in sync while saving
bandwidth.

Overview
Incremental synchronization consists of two stages:
Initial full sync is performed once at the very beginning in order to fully
synchronize the client’s state with the server’s state. The client will obtain
a sync token that it needs to persist.
Incremental sync is performed repeatedly and updates the client with all
the changes that happened ever since the previous sync. Each time, the client
provides the previous sync token it obtained from the server and stores the new sync token from the response.
A sync token is a piece of data
exchanged between the server and the client, and has a critical role in
the synchronization process. An example would look like the following:
"nextSyncToken": "CPDAlvWDx70CEPDAlvWDx70CGAU=",
Initial full sync
The initial full sync is the original request for all the resources of the
collection you want to synchronize. You can optionally restrict the list
request using request parameters if you only want to synchronize a specific
subset of resources.
In the response to the list operation, you will find a field called
nextSyncToken representing a sync token. You'll need to store the value of
nextSyncToken . If the result set is too large and the response gets
paginated , then the nextSyncToken
field is present only on the very last page.
You don’t need to worry about any new entries appearing
while you are paginating — they won’t be missed. The information
needed for the server to generate a correct sync token is encoded in the
page token.
Incremental sync
Incremental sync allows you to retrieve all the resources that have been
modified since the last sync request. To do this, you need to perform a list
request with your most recent sync token specified in the syncToken field.
Keep in mind that the result will always contain deleted entries, so that the
clients get the chance to remove them from storage.
In cases where a large number of resources have changed since the last
incremental sync request, you may find a pageToken instead of a syncToken in the list result. In these cases you'll need to perform the exact same
list query as was used for retrieval of the first page in the incremental sync
(with the exact same syncToken ), append the pageToken to it and
paginate through all the following requests until you find another syncToken on the last page. Make sure to store this syncToken for the next sync
request in the future.
Here are example queries for a case requiring incremental paginated sync:
Original query
GET /calendars/primary/events?maxResults=10&singleEvents=true&syncToken=CPDAlvWDx70CEPDAlvWDx
// Result contains the following
"nextPageToken":"CiAKGjBpNDd2Nmp2Zml2cXRwYjBpOXA",
Retrieving next page
GET /calendars/primary/events?maxResults=10&singleEvents=true&syncToken=CPDAlvWDx70CEPDAlvWDx&pageToken=CiAKGjBpNDd2Nmp2Zml2cXRwYjBpOXA
The set of query parameters that can be used on incremental
syncs is restricted. Each list request should use the same set of query
parameters, including the initial request. For the individual restrictions on
each collection, see the corresponding documentation for list requests. The
response code for list queries containing disallowed restrictions is
400 .
Full sync required by server
Sometimes sync tokens are invalidated by the server, for various reasons
including token expiration or changes in related ACLs.
In such cases, the server will respond to an incremental request with a
response code 410 . This should trigger a full wipe of the client’s store
and a new full sync.
Sample code
The snippet of sample code below demonstrates how to use sync tokens with the
Java client library . The first time
the run method is called it will perform a full sync and store the sync token.
On each subsequent execution it will load the saved sync token and perform an
incremental sync.
private static void run () throws IOException {
// Construct the {@link Calendar.Events.List} request, but don't execute it yet.
Calendar . Events . List request = client . events (). list ( "primary" );
// Load the sync token stored from the last execution, if any.
String syncToken = syncSettingsDataStore . get ( SYNC_TOKEN_KEY );
if ( syncToken == null ) {
System . out . println ( "Performing full sync." );
// Set the filters you want to use during the full sync. Sync tokens aren't compatible with
// most filters, but you may want to limit your full sync to only a certain date range.
// In this example we are only syncing events up to a year old.
Date oneYearAgo = Utils . getRelativeDate ( java . util . Calendar . YEAR , - 1 );
request . setTimeMin ( new DateTime ( oneYearAgo , TimeZone . getTimeZone ( "UTC" )));
} else {
System . out . println ( "Performing incremental sync." );
request . setSyncToken ( syncToken );
}
// Retrieve the events, one page at a time.
String pageToken = null ;
Events events = null ;
do {
request . setPageToken ( pageToken );
try {
events = request . execute ();
} catch ( GoogleJsonResponseException e ) {
if ( e . getStatusCode () == 410 ) {
// A 410 status code, "Gone", indicates that the sync token is invalid.
System . out . println ( "Invalid sync token, clearing event store and re-syncing." );
syncSettingsDataStore . delete ( SYNC_TOKEN_KEY );
eventDataStore . clear ();
run ();
} else {
throw e ;
}
}
List<Event> items = events . getItems ();
if ( items . size () == 0 ) {
System . out . println ( "No new events to sync." );
} else {
for ( Event event : items ) {
syncEvent ( event );
}
}
pageToken = events . getNextPageToken ();
} while ( pageToken != null );
// Store the sync token from the last request to be used during the next execution.
syncSettingsDataStore . set ( SYNC_TOKEN_KEY , events . getNextSyncToken ());
System . out . println ( "Sync complete." );
} SyncTokenSample . java
Legacy synchronization
For event collections, it is still possible to do synchronization in the
legacy manner by preserving the value of the updated field from an events list
request and then using the modifiedSince field to retrieve updated events.
This approach is no longer recommended as it is more error-prone with respect
to missed updates (for example if does not enforce query restrictions).
Furthermore, it is available only for events.
