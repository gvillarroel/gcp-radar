This document describes how to use push notifications that inform your
application when a resource changes.
Overview
The Google Calendar API provides push notifications that let you monitor
changes in resources. You can use this feature to improve the performance of
your application. It lets you eliminate the extra network and compute
costs involved with polling resources to determine if they have changed.
Whenever a watched resource changes, the Google Calendar API notifies your
application.
To use push notifications, you must do two things:
Set up your receiving URL or "webhook" callback receiver.
This
is an HTTPS server that handles the API notification messages that are
triggered when a resource changes.
Set up a ( notification channel ) for each resource endpoint you want to
watch.
A channel specifies routing information for notification
messages. As part of the channel setup, you must identify the specific URL where
you want to receive notifications. Whenever a channel's resource changes,
the Google Calendar API sends a notification message as a POST
request to that URL.
Currently, the Google Calendar API supports notifications for changes to
the Acl , CalendarList , Events , and Settings resources.
Create notification channels
To request push notifications, you must set up a notification channel
for each resource you want to monitor. After your notification channels are set
up, the Google Calendar API informs your application when any watched resource
changes.
Make watch requests
Each watchable Google Calendar API resource has an associated
watch method at a URI of the following form:
https://www.googleapis.com/ API_NAME / API_VERSION / RESOURCE_PATH /watch
To set up a notification channel for messages about changes to a
particular resource, send a POST request to the
watch method for the resource.
Each notification channel is associated both with a particular user and
a particular resource (or set of resources). A watch request
won't be successful unless the current user
owns or has permission to access this resource.
Example
Start watching for changes to a collection of events on a given calendar:
POST https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/my_calendar@gmail.com/events/watch
Authorization: Bearer auth_token_for_current_user
Content-Type: application/json
{
"id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123456789ab",
"type": "web_hook",
"address": "https://mydomain.com/notifications",
...
"token": "target=myApp-myCalendarChannelDest",
"expiration": 1426325213000
}
In the request body, provide your channel id ,
the type as web_hook , and your receiving URL in address .
You can also optionally provide:
A token to use as your channel token.
An expiration time in milliseconds for your requested channel expiration time.
Required properties
With each watch request, you must provide these fields:
An id property string that uniquely identifies this
new notification channel within your project. We recommend using
a universally unique identifier
( UUID ) or any similar
unique string. Maximum length: 64 characters.
The ID value you set is echoed back in the
X-Goog-Channel-Id HTTP header of every notification
message that you receive for this channel.
A type property string set to the value
web_hook .
An address property string set to the URL that listens
and responds to notifications for this notification channel. This is
your webhook callback URL, and it must use HTTPS.
Note that the Google Calendar API is able to send notifications to
this HTTPS address only if there's a valid SSL certificate installed
on your web server. Invalid certificates include:
Self-signed certificates.
Certificates signed by an untrusted source.
Certificates that have been revoked.
Certificates that have a subject that doesn't match the target
hostname.
Optional properties
You can also specify these optional fields with your
watch request:
A token property that specifies an arbitrary string
value to use as a channel token. You can use notification channel
tokens for various purposes. For example, you can use the
token to verify that each incoming message is for a channel that your
application created—to ensure that the notification is not being
spoofed—or to route the message to the right destination within
your application based on the purpose of this channel. Maximum length:
256 characters.
The token is included in the
X-Goog-Channel-Token HTTP header in every notification
message that your application receives for this channel.
If you use notification channel tokens, we recommend that you:
Use an extensible encoding format, such as URL query
parameters. Example: forwardTo=hr&createdBy=mobile
Don't include sensitive data such as OAuth tokens.
Note: If you must send highly-sensitive
data, make sure it's encrypted before adding it to the
token.
An expiration property string set to a
Unix timestamp
(in milliseconds) of the date and time when you want the Google Calendar API to
stop sending messages for this notification channel.
If a channel has an expiration time, it's included as the value
of the X-Goog-Channel-Expiration HTTP header (in human-readable
format) in every notification message that your
application receives for this channel.
For more details on the request, refer to the watch method
for the Acl , CalendarList , Events , and Settings resources in the API Reference.
Watch response
If the watch request successfully creates a notification
channel, it returns an HTTP 200 OK status code.
The message body of the watch response provides information about the
notification channel you just created, as shown in the example below.
{
"kind": "api#channel",
"id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123456789ab",
"resourceId": "o3hgv1538sdjfh",
"resourceUri": "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/my_calendar@gmail.com/events",
"token": "target=myApp-myCalendarChannelDest",
"expiration": 1426325213000
}
The response body provides channel details such as:
kind : Identifies this as an API channel resource.
id : The ID you specified for this channel.
resourceId : The ID of the watched resource.
resourceUri : The version-specific ID of the watched resource.
token : The token provided in the request body.
expiration : The channel expiration time as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.
In addition to the properties you sent as part of your request, the
returned information also includes the resourceId and
resourceUri to identify the resource being watched on this
notification channel.
Note: The resourceId property is a
stable, version-independent identifier for the resource. The
resourceUri property is the canonical URI of the watched
resource in the context of the current API version, so it's
version-specific.
You can pass the returned information to other notification channel
operations, such as when you want to stop receiving
notifications .
For more details on the response, refer to the watch
method for the Acl , CalendarList , Events , and Settings resources in the API Reference.
Sync message
After creating a notification channel to watch a resource, the
Google Calendar API sends a sync message to indicate that
notifications are starting. The X-Goog-Resource-State HTTP
header value for these messages is sync . Due to network
timing issues, it's possible to receive the sync message
even before you receive the watch method response.
It's safe to ignore the sync notification, but you can
also use it. For example, if you decide you don't want to keep
the channel, you can use the X-Goog-Channel-ID and
X-Goog-Resource-ID values in a call to
stop receiving notifications . You can also use the
sync notification to do some initialization to prepare for
later events.
The format of sync messages the Google Calendar API sends to
your receiving URL is shown below.
POST https://mydomain.com/notifications // Your receiving URL.
X-Goog-Channel-ID: channel-ID-value
X-Goog-Channel-Token: channel-token-value
X-Goog-Channel-Expiration: expiration-date-and-time // In human-readable format. Present only if the channel expires.
X-Goog-Resource-ID: identifier-for-the-watched-resource
X-Goog-Resource-URI: version-specific-URI-of-the-watched-resource
X-Goog-Resource-State: sync
X-Goog-Message-Number: 1
Sync messages always have an X-Goog-Message-Number HTTP
header value of 1 . Each subsequent notification for this channel has
a message number that's larger than the previous one, though the message
numbers will not be sequential.
Renew notification channels
A notification channel can have an expiration time, with a value
determined either by your request or by any Google Calendar API internal limits
or defaults (the more restrictive value is used). The channel's expiration
time, if it has one, is included as a Unix timestamp
(in milliseconds) in the information returned by the watch method. In addition, the
expiration date and time is included (in human-readable format) in every
notification message your application receives for this channel in the
X-Goog-Channel-Expiration HTTP header.
Currently, there's no automatic way to renew a notification channel. When
a channel is close to its expiration, you must replace it with a new one by calling
the watch method. As always, you must use a unique value for
the id property of the new channel. Note that there's likely
to be an "overlap" period of time when the two notification channels for the
same resource are active.
Receive notifications
Whenever a watched resource changes, your application receives a
notification message describing the change. The Google Calendar API sends these
messages as HTTPS POST requests to the URL you specified as the
address property for this notification
channel.
Note: Notification delivery HTTPS requests
specify a user agent of APIs-Google and respect robots.txt
directives, as described in APIs Google
User Agent .
Interpret the notification message format
All notification messages include a set of HTTP headers that have
X-Goog- prefixes.
Some types of notifications can also include a
message body.
Headers
Notification messages posted by the Google Calendar API to your receiving
URL include the following HTTP headers:
Header
Description
Always present
X-Goog-Channel-ID
UUID or other unique string you provided to identify this
notification channel.
X-Goog-Message-Number
Integer that identifies this message for this notification
channel. Value is always 1 for sync messages. Message
numbers increase for each subsequent message on the channel, but they're
not sequential.
X-Goog-Resource-ID
An opaque value identifying the watched resource. This ID is
stable across API versions.
X-Goog-Resource-State
The new resource state that triggered the notification.
Possible values:
sync , exists , or
not_exists .
X-Goog-Resource-URI
An API-version-specific identifier for the watched resource.
Sometimes present
X-Goog-Channel-Expiration
Date and time of notification channel expiration, expressed in
human-readable format. Only present if defined.
X-Goog-Channel-Token
Notification channel token that was set by your application, and
that you can use to verify the notification source. Only present if
defined.
Notification messages posted by the Google Calendar API to your receiving URL do not include a message body. These messages do not contain specific information about updated resources, you will need to make another API call to see the full change details.
Examples
Change notification message for modified collection of events:
POST https://mydomain.com/notifications // Your receiving URL.
Content-Type: application/json; utf-8
Content-Length: 0
X-Goog-Channel-ID: 4ba78bf0-6a47-11e2-bcfd-0800200c9a66
X-Goog-Channel-Token: 398348u3tu83ut8uu38
X-Goog-Channel-Expiration: Tue, 19 Nov 2013 01:13:52 GMT
X-Goog-Resource-ID: ret08u3rv24htgh289g
X-Goog-Resource-URI: https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/my_calendar@gmail.com/events
X-Goog-Resource-State: exists
X-Goog-Message-Number: 10
Respond to notifications
To indicate success, you can return any of the following status codes:
200 , 201 , 202 , 204 , or
102 .
If your service uses Google's API client library
and returns 500 , 502 , 503 , or 504 , the Google Calendar API
retries with exponential backoff .
Every other return status code is considered to be a message failure.
Understand Google Calendar API notification events

receive when using push notifications with the Google Calendar API.

exists
ACLs, Calendar lists, Events, Settings.
There was a change to a resource. Possible changes include the creation of a new resource, or the modification or deletion of an existing resource.
Stop notifications
The expiration property controls when the notifications stop automatically. You can
choose to stop receiving notifications for a particular channel before it
expires by calling the stop method at
the following URI:
https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/channels/stop
This method requires that you provide at least the channel's
id and the resourceId properties, as shown in the
example below. Note that if the Google Calendar API has several types of
resources that have watch methods, there's only one
stop method.
Only users with the right permission can stop a channel. In particular:
If the channel was created by a regular user account, only the same
user from the same client (as identified by the OAuth 2.0 client IDs from the
auth tokens) who created the channel can stop the channel.
If the channel was created by a service account, any user from the same
client can stop the channel.
The following code sample shows how to stop receiving notifications:
POST https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/channels/stop
Authorization: Bearer CURRENT_USER_AUTH_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
{
"id": "4ba78bf0-6a47-11e2-bcfd-0800200c9a66",
"resourceId": "ret08u3rv24htgh289g"
}
Special considerations
When working with push notifications, keep the following in mind:
Events and ACLs are per-calendar If you want to get notified about all event or ACL changes for calendars A and B, you need to separately subscribe to the events/ACL collections for A and for B.
Settings and calendar lists are per-user Settings and calendar lists only have one collection per user, so you can subscribe just once.
Also, you won’t be notified when you gain access to a new collection (for example, a new calendar) although you will be notified if that calendar is added to the calendar list (assuming you are subscribed to the calendar list collection).
Notifications are not 100% reliable. Expect a small percentage of messages to get dropped under normal working conditions. Make sure to handle these
missing messages gracefully, so that the application still syncs even if no push messages are received.
