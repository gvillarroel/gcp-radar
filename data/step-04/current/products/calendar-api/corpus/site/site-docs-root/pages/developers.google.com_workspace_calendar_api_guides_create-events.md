Create events
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Imagine an app that helps users find the best hiking routes. By adding the
hiking plan as a calendar event, the users get a lot of help in staying
organized automatically. Google Calendar helps them to share the plan and
reminds them about it so they can get prepared with no stress. Also, thanks to
seamless integration of Google products, Google Now pings them about the time to
leave and Google Maps direct them to the meeting spot on time.
This article explains how to create calendar events and add them to your users'
calendars.
Add an event
To create an event, call the
events.insert() method providing at
least these parameters:
calendarId is the calendar identifier and can either be the email address
of the calendar on which to create the event or a special keyword
'primary' which will use the primary calendar of the logged in user. If
you don't know the email address of the calendar you would like to use, you
can check it either in the calendar's settings of the Google Calendar web
UI (in the section "Calendar Address") or you can look for it
in the result of the
calendarList.list() call.
event is the event to create with all the necessary details such as start
and end. The only two required fields are the start and end times. See the
event reference for the full set of event
fields.
Specify timed events using the start.dateTime
and end.dateTime fields. For all-day events, use
start.date and end.date instead.
In order to successfully create events, you need to:
Set your OAuth scope to https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar so that
you have edit access to the user's calendar.
Ensure the authenticated user has write access to the calendar with the
calendarId you provided (for example by calling
calendarList.get() for the
calendarId and checking the accessRole ).
Add event metadata
You can optionally add event metadata when you create a calendar event. If you
choose not to add metadata during creation, you can update many fields using the
events.update() ; however, some fields,
such as the event ID, can only be set during an
events.insert() operation.
Location
Adding an address into the location field enables features such as
"time to leave" or displaying a map with the directions.
Event ID
When creating an event, you can choose to generate your own event ID
that conforms to our format requirements. This enables you to keep entities
in your local database in sync with events in Google Calendar. It also
prevents duplicate event creation if the operation fails at some point after
it is successfully executed in the Calendar backend. If no
event ID is provided, the server generates one for you. See the event ID
reference for more information.
Attendees
The event you create appears on all the primary Google Calendars of
the attendees you included with the same event ID. If you set
sendUpdates to "all" or "externalOnly" in your insert request,
the corresponding attendees receive an email notification for your event. To
learn more, see
events with multiple attendees .

Add Drive attachments to events
You can attach Google Drive
files such as meeting notes in Docs, budgets in
Sheets, presentations in Slides, or any other
relevant Google Drive files to your calendar events. You can add the
attachment when you create an event with
events.insert() or later as part of an
update such as with events.patch()
The two parts of attaching a Google Drive file to an event are:
Get the file alternateLink URL, title , and mimeType from the
Drive API Files resource ,
typically with the files.get()
method.
Create or update an event with the attachments fields set in the request
body and the supportsAttachments parameter set to true .
The following code example demonstrates how to update an existing event to add
an attachment:
Java
public static void addAttachment ( Calendar calendarService , Drive driveService , String calendarId ,
String eventId , String fileId ) throws IOException {
File file = driveService . files (). get ( fileId ). execute ();
Event event = calendarService . events (). get ( calendarId , eventId ). execute ();
List<EventAttachment> attachments = event . getAttachments ();
if ( attachments == null ) {
attachments = new ArrayList<EventAttachment> ();
}
attachments . add ( new EventAttachment ()
. setFileUrl ( file . getAlternateLink ())
. setMimeType ( file . getMimeType ())
. setTitle ( file . getTitle ()));
Event changes = new Event ()
. setAttachments ( attachments );
calendarService . events (). patch ( calendarId , eventId , changes )
. setSupportsAttachments ( true )
. execute ();
}
PHP
function addAttachment($calendarService, $driveService, $calendarId, $eventId, $fileId) {
$file = $driveService->files->get($fileId);
$event = $calendarService->events->get($calendarId, $eventId);
$attachments = $event->attachments;
$attachments[] = array(
'fileUrl' => $file->alternateLink,
'mimeType' => $file->mimeType,
'title' => $file->title
);
$changes = new Google_Service_Calendar_Event(array(
'attachments' => $attachments
));
$calendarService->events->patch($calendarId, $eventId, $changes, array(
'supportsAttachments' => TRUE
));
}
Python
def add_attachment ( calendarService , driveService , calendarId , eventId , fileId ):
file = driveService . files () . get ( fileId = fileId ) . execute ()
event = calendarService . events () . get ( calendarId = calendarId ,
eventId = eventId ) . execute ()
attachments = event . get ( 'attachments' , [])
attachments . append ({
'fileUrl' : file [ 'alternateLink' ],
'mimeType' : file [ 'mimeType' ],
'title' : file [ 'title' ]
})
changes = {
'attachments' : attachments
}
calendarService . events () . patch ( calendarId = calendarId , eventId = eventId ,
body = changes ,
supportsAttachments = True ) . execute ()
Important: You must perform a full sync
of all events before enabling the supportsAttachments parameter for event
modifications when adding attachments support into your existing app that stores
events locally. If you do not perform a sync first, you may inadvertently remove
existing attachments from user's events.
Add video and phone conferences to events
You can associate events with
Hangouts and
Google Meet conferences to
allow your users to meet remotely via a phone call or a video call.
The conferenceData field can
be used to read, copy, and clear existing conference details; it can also be
used to request generation of new conferences. To allow creation and
modification of conference details, set the conferenceDataVersion request
parameter to 1 .
There are three types of conferenceData currently supported, as denoted by the
conferenceData.conferenceSolution.key.type :
Hangouts for consumers ( eventHangout )
Classic Hangouts for Google Workspace users
(deprecated; eventNamedHangout )
Google Meet ( hangoutsMeet )
You can learn which conference type is supported for any given calendar of a
user by looking at the conferenceProperties.allowedConferenceSolutionTypes in
the calendars and
calendarList collections. You can also
learn whether the user prefers to have Hangouts created for all their newly
created events by checking the autoAddHangouts setting in the
settings collection.
Besides the type , the conferenceSolution also provides the name and the
iconUri fields that you can use to represent the conference solution as shown
below:
JavaScript
const solution = event . conferenceData . conferenceSolution ;
const content = document . getElementById ( "content" );
const text = document . createTextNode ( "Join " + solution . name );
const icon = document . createElement ( "img" );
icon . src = solution . iconUri ;
content . appendChild ( icon );
content . appendChild ( text );
You can create a new conference for an event by providing a createRequest with
a newly generated requestId which can be a random string . Conferences are
created asynchronously, but you can always check the status of your request to
let your users know what’s happening.
For example, to request conference generation for an existing event:
JavaScript
const eventPatch = {
conferenceData : {
createRequest : { requestId : "7qxalsvy0e" }
}
};
gapi . client . calendar . events . patch ({
calendarId : "primary" ,
eventId : "7cbh8rpc10lrc0ckih9tafss99" ,
resource : eventPatch ,
sendUpdates : "all" ,
conferenceDataVersion : 1
}). execute ( function ( event ) {
console . log ( "Conference created for event: %s" , event . htmlLink );
});
The immediate response to this call might not yet contain the fully-populated
conferenceData ; this is indicated by a status code of pending in the
status
field. The status code changes to success after the conference information is
populated. The entryPoints field contains information about which video and
phone URIs are available for your users to dial in.
If you wish to schedule multiple Calendar events with the same
conference details, you can copy the entire conferenceData from one event to
another.
Copying is useful in certain situations. For example, suppose you are developing
a recruiting application that sets up separate events for the candidate and the
interviewer—you want to protect the interviewer’s identity, but you also
want to make sure all participants join the same conference call.
Important: You must perform a full sync
of all events before enabling the conference data support (by setting of the
conferenceDataVersion request parameter to 1 for event modifications) when
adding conference support into your existing app that stores events locally. If
you do not perform a sync first, you may inadvertently remove existing
conferences from users' events.
