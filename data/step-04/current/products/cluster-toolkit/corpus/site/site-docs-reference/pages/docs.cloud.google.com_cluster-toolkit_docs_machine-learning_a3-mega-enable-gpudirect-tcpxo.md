Enable GPUDirect-TCPXO optimized NCCL communication
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides an overview of how to enable GPUDirect-TCPXO for
optimizing communication in multi-node workloads, such as ML training, by using
a NCCL tests to measure
NCCL collective performance between two nodes of an A3 Mega a3-megagpu-8g
Slurm cluster.
Before you begin
You need to have an A3 Mega Slurm cluster that was created by using Cluster Toolkit
version v1.51.1 or later. To create the cluster, see
Deploy an A3 Mega Slurm cluster for ML training .
A3 Mega Slurm clusters that are created by using Cluster Toolkit
version 1.39.0 or later have automatic integration of topology aware scheduling.
Network components
The following components are used to optimize the network performance for
your a3-megagpu-8g Slurm cluster.
GPUDirect-TCPXO
GPUDirect-TCPXO is a custom, remote direct memory access (RDMA)
networking stack that increases the network performance of your VMs by
allowing data packet payloads to transfer directly from GPU memory to the
network interface without having to go through the CPU and system memory.
a3-megagpu-8g VMs can use GPUDirect-TCPXO combined with
Google Virtual NIC (gVNIC)
to deliver higher throughput between VMs in a cluster when compared to the
A2 accelerator-optimized machine types on Google Cloud.
The Receive Data Path Manager (RxDM)
To achieve optimal application performance, an additional service called the
Receive Data Path Manager (RxDM) runs alongside the applications that use
GPUDirect-TCPXO.
Additionally, a NCCL net plugin must be installed into the
execution environment of the workload. Both the RxDM and plugin are distributed
by a PyTorch Docker image.
The cluster deployment blueprint
The examples/machine-learning/a3-megagpu-8g/a3mega-slurm-blueprint.yaml blueprint includes a
Slurm prolog
and epilog script that runs before and after every job running on more than
one a3-megagpu-8g compute node.
The prolog performs the following actions:
Checks that the import-helper kernel module is loaded.
Installs the NCCL net plugin into /var/lib/tcpxo/lib64/ of the host.
Runs the RxDM service, which is a long-lived service that runs alongside the
job. Starting the RxDM can take 10-20 seconds, which blocks the start of the
job until the RxDM service is initialized. While the RxDM is starting up,
you won't see the slurm job output/error logs.
The epilog performs the following actions:
Stops the RxDM service.
Prunes any stopped containers and frees up disk space.
For more information about prolog and epilog actions, see the
Slurm documentation .
Use GPUDirect-TCPXO with single-node Slurm jobs
By default, Slurm only launches the RxDM container for multi-node jobs on A3
instances. RxDM is not required for single-node training performance. However,
if your job script enables the GPUDirect-TCPXO NCCL plugin, the plugin
attempts to connect to RxDM and fails with a timeout error. To resolve this
issue, you can choose from the following options:
Modify job scripts for single-node jobs: For jobs that run on a single
node, disable the GPUDirect-TCPXO plugin to prevent the timeout. In your job
script, set the NCCL_NET_PLUGIN environment variable to none to
disable the plugin. We recommend that you set environment variables at the
beginning of your job script. For example, add the following line at the
start of your script:
export NCCL_NET_PLUGIN = none
With this setting, NCCL falls back to a different network plugin that
doesn't require RxDM. For an example of how to define environment
variables, see the run-nccl-tests.sh script.
Enable RxDM for all jobs: If you frequently switch between single-node and
multi-node jobs and prefer a consistent configuration, modify the Slurm
prolog script on your controller node. This script, located at
/opt/apps/adm/slurm/scripts/rxdm , contains the logic for launching RxDM.
Update this script to configure it to start the RxDM container for all
jobs, regardless of the node count. This configuration makes the use of
the GPUDirect-TCPXO plugin transparent to your job scripts.
Connect to the A3 Mega Slurm cluster
To enable optimized NCCL communication tuning on your cluster, you must login
to the Slurm login node. To login, you can use either Google Cloud console or
Google Cloud CLI.
Console
Go to the Compute Engine > VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Locate the login node. It should have a name similar to
a3mega-login-001 .
From the Connect column of the login node, click SSH .
gcloud
To connect to the login node, use the
gcloud compute ssh command .
gcloud compute ssh $(gcloud compute instances list --filter "name ~ login" --format "value(name)") \
--tunnel-through-iap \
--zone ZONE
Create an enroot container
From the login node on your cluster, import a Pytorch image from the
NVIDIA container registry .
To import the PyTorch image, run the following Slurm srun command from the login node:
srun -N 1 enroot import docker://nvcr.io#nvidia/pytorch:24.04-py3
This runs on one of your a3-megagpu-8g nodes that has more CPU and memory than
the login node, which enroot can use to more quickly import the container.
When the import completes, you should have a file named
nvidia+pytorch+24.04-py3.sqsh in the directory where you ran the command.
Build NCCL test
Next, build the NCCL-test binaries by running the following command
from the same directory as the previous step:
CONTAINER_IMAGE=./nvidia+pytorch+24.04-py3.sqsh
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests.git
srun --partition a3mega \
--ntasks-per-node=1 \
--gpus-per-node=8 \
--container-mounts="$PWD:/nccl" \
--container-image=${CONTAINER_IMAGE} \
bash -c "
cd /nccl/nccl-tests/ &&
MPI=1 CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx make -j
"
This creates a directory named nccl-tests . The preceding command uses
--container-mounts to mount your current working directory $PWD into the
/nccl directory inside the container.
After the srun command finishes, check that the nccl-tests/build folder
contains several binaries, including all_gather_perf .
Run NCCL test
As part of the cluster deployment process, a Slurm
prolog and epilog
are installed which handles automatic installation of both a custom
libnccl-net.so and the running of a sidecar process that enables GPUDirect-TCPXO
optimized communication.
To run any job run on an A3 Mega cluster, several environment
variables must be set in order to enable high performance networking with
GPUDirect-TCPXO. Because we use enroot containers in this procedure to launch
workloads, these variables must be set in the container environment as opposed
to the host environment.
Note: The GPUDirect-TCPXO NCCL plugin is internally referred to as FasTrak. You
might see this name in environment variables and configuration files.
To run the NCCL test, complete the following steps.
Use a text editor to create a file named run-nccl-tests.sh
and add the following content to the file.
Pro Tip: You can also add
export NCCL_NET=FasTrak . This causes the process to
fail if any of the configuration are not set properly.
