Cloud Deployment Manager will reach end of support on March 31, 2026 . If you currently use Deployment Manager, please migrate to Infrastructure Manager or an alternative deployment technology by March 31, 2026 to ensure your services continue without interruption.
For more information on the deprecation and shutdown, see Deployment Manager deprecation .

Access control with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
By default, all Google Cloud console projects come with a single user:
the original project creator. No other users have access to the project, and
therefore, access to Google Cloud resources, until a user is added as
a project team member. This page describes the different ways you can add new
users to your project.
It also describes how Deployment Manager authenticates to other
Google Cloud APIs on your behalf to create resources.
Before you begin
If you want to use the command-line examples in this guide, install the `gcloud` command-line tool .
If you want to use the API examples in this guide, set up API access .
Understand Google Cloud console projects.
Understand Google Identity and Access Management .
Access control for users
To give your users access to your project so they can create configurations and
deployments, add your users as a project team member and grant them the
appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.
For information on how to add team members, read the
documentation for adding team members .

Access control for Deployment Manager
To create other Google Cloud resources, Deployment Manager uses the
credentials of the Google APIs Service Agent to authenticate to other
APIs. The Google APIs Service Agent is designed specifically to run internal
Google processes on your behalf. This service account is identifiable using the
email:
[ PROJECT_NUMBER ] @cloudservices . gserviceaccount.com
The Google APIs Service Agent is automatically granted the Editor role at the
project level and is listed in the IAM section of the
Google Cloud console. This service account exists indefinitely with the
project, and is only deleted when the project is deleted. Since
Deployment Manager and other services, such as
managed instance groups ,
rely on this service account to create, delete, and manage resources, it is
not recommended that you modify this account's permissions.
Note: If you are using Deployment Manager to manage critical resources, such as
projects or custom IAM roles, you must assign additional
IAM roles to the default Google APIs Service Agent. For
example, if you want to use Deployment Manager to create and manage custom
IAM roles, you must add the Role Administrator role to the Google
APIs Service Agent.
