Understanding reusable templates
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
While developing an app, you most likely require complex architectures. To
make your deployment easier to replicate and troubleshoot, we recommend that you
break your configuration into templates .
A template is a separate file that defines a set of resources. You can reuse
templates across different deployments, which creates consistency across complex
deployments.
You can use Python or Jinja2 to create templates for Deployment Manager.
We recommend that you use Python templates, because Python allows for greater
flexibility and more features as you scale your app.
Python templates
If you choose to write templates in Python, your templates must meet
these requirements:
The template must be written in Python 3.x
The template must define a method called GenerateConfig(context) or
generate_config(context) . If you use both method names in the same template,
the generate_config() method will take precedence.
The context object contains metadata about the deployment and your
environment, such as the deployment's name, the current project, and so on.
You'll use these deployment-specific variables in later steps.
The method must return a
Python dictionary .
Examining sample templates
From the samples repository, open vm-template.py :
cd deploymentmanager-samples/examples/v2/step_by_step_guide/step5_create_a_template/python
nano vm-template.py # use your preferred text editor
This template defines the first virtual machine (VM) from the earlier samples:

"""Creates the virtual machine."""
COMPUTE_URL_BASE = 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/'
def GenerateConfig ( unused_context ):
"""Creates the first virtual machine."""
resources = [{
'name' : 'the-first-vm' ,
'type' : 'compute.v1.instance' ,
'properties' : {
'zone' : 'us-central1-f' ,
'machineType' : '' . join ([ COMPUTE_URL_BASE , 'projects/MY_PROJECT' ,
'/zones/us-central1-f/' ,
'machineTypes/f1-micro' ]),
'disks' : [{
'deviceName' : 'boot' ,
'type' : 'PERSISTENT' ,
'boot' : True ,
'autoDelete' : True ,
'initializeParams' : {
'sourceImage' : '' . join ([ COMPUTE_URL_BASE , 'projects/' ,
'debian-cloud/global/' ,
'images/family/debian-11' ])
}
}],
'networkInterfaces' : [{
'network' : '$(ref.a-new-network.selfLink)' ,
'accessConfigs' : [{
'name' : 'External NAT' ,
'type' : 'ONE_TO_ONE_NAT'
}]
}]
}
}]
return { 'resources' : resources }
Open the second template, vm-template-2.py , which defines the second VM:

"""Creates the virtual machine."""
COMPUTE_URL_BASE = 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/'
def GenerateConfig ( unused_context ):
"""Creates the second virtual machine."""
resources = [{
'name' : 'the-second-vm' ,
'type' : 'compute.v1.instance' ,
'properties' : {
'zone' : 'us-central1-f' ,
'machineType' : '' . join ([ COMPUTE_URL_BASE , 'projects/MY_PROJECT' ,
'/zones/us-central1-f/' ,
'machineTypes/g1-small' ]),
'disks' : [{
'deviceName' : 'boot' ,
'type' : 'PERSISTENT' ,
'boot' : True ,
'autoDelete' : True ,
'initializeParams' : {
'sourceImage' : '' . join ([ COMPUTE_URL_BASE , 'projects/' ,
'debian-cloud/global' ,
'/images/family/debian-11' ])
}
}],
'networkInterfaces' : [{
'network' : '$(ref.a-new-network.selfLink)' ,
'accessConfigs' : [{
'name' : 'External NAT' ,
'type' : 'ONE_TO_ONE_NAT'
}]
}]
}
}]
return { 'resources' : resources }
In both templates, replace MY_PROJECT with your
project ID.
Importing templates
After you create templates, you must import them into your configuration. Open
the new two-vms.yaml :
cd deploymentmanager-samples/examples/v2/step_by_step_guide/step5_create_a_template/python
nano two-vms.yaml # use your preferred text editor
This configuration file has a new imports section that calls the two VM
templates, vm-template.py and vm-template-2.py :
# Copyright 2016 Google Inc. All rights reserved.
#
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at
#

#
# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
# distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

# limitations under the License.
imports :
- path : vm-template.py
- path : vm-template-2.py
# In the resources section below, the properties of the resources are replaced
# with the names of the templates.
resources :
- name : vm-1
type : vm-template.py
- name : vm-2
type : vm-template-2.py
- name : a-new-network
type : compute.v1.network
properties :
routingConfig :
routingMode : REGIONAL
autoCreateSubnetworks : true
A note about resource names
When you use a template, your resource names are defined using the name field
provided in the template, not the name in the configuration file.
For example, in this case, the VM instances are created using the names in the
templates, the-first-vm and the-second-vm . The values vm-1 and vm-2 ,
defined in the configuration, are used to name an instantiation of the template,
but are not resource names.
Saving your configuration and deploying it
To deploy the configuration, run this command:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create deployment-with-templates --config two-vms.yaml
To view your deployment, run this command:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments describe deployment-with-templates
Looking ahead: using multiple templates
In the next step, you combine templates so that your configuration only calls
one template to deploy all your resources.
Deleting your deployment
Before proceeding, we recommend that you delete the deployment to avoid charges.
You don't need this deployment for the next step. Run the following command to
delete the deployment:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete deployment-with-templates
