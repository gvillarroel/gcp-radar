Cloud Deployment Manager will reach end of support on March 31, 2026 . If you currently use Deployment Manager, please migrate to Infrastructure Manager or an alternative deployment technology by March 31, 2026 to ensure your services continue without interruption.
For more information on the deprecation and shutdown, see Deployment Manager deprecation .

Syntax Reference
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes the syntax used by Deployment Manager. Use this guide as a
reference for what syntax to use in your configurations and templates.
Syntax for configurations and templates
Basic syntax
resources - A set of resources to create.
name - The name for this instantiation of this resource.
type - The resource type. This can be a base type like compute.v1.instance ,
a type provider such as gcp-types/compute-v1:addresses , or an imported
template. See the list of supported type providers .
properties - The properties of this resource. For an introduction, see
Template properties .
metadata - Extra configuration for this resource. See a list of
fields in Metadata .
Example
resources :
- name : vm - instance
type : compute . v1 . instance
properties :
machineType : zones / us - central1 - a / machineTypes / n1 - standard - 1
...
Access Control
If you want to set IAM policies on your resources, you use an accessControl
section:
Add the accessControl section to the top-level configuration for each
resource for which you want to apply access control policies.
Specify the desired gcpIamPolicy for the resource. Each IAM policy can
contain a list of bindings. Each binding binds a list of principals to a
role.
For detailed information on controlling access to resources, see
Setting access control in a configuration .
For example, the following accessControl section adds bindings that grant
these roles to users:
User
Role
alice@example.com
roles/pubsub.editor
my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
jane@example.com
roles/pubsub.publisher
resources :
- name: a - new - pubsub - topic
type : pubsub . v1 . topic
properties :
...
accessControl :
gcpIamPolicy :
bindings :
- role : roles / pubsub . editor
members :
- "user:alice@example.com"
- role : roles / pubsub . publisher
members :
- "user:jane@example.com"
- "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
References
For information on when to use references, and more examples, learn more about
creating references .
You can use references to the properties of other resources instead of
directly providing values. For example, if you want to create an instance group
manager that uses an instance template from the same deployment, instead of
explicitly typing the full link for the instance template, you can use a
reference with the syntax $(ref.instance-template.selfLink) .
To see which properties you can create references to, see the get method for
the resource's API. For example, for a list of all the properties for a VM
instance, see the response for the
instances.get() method .
You declare references using a similar syntax to the JSONPath 'dot' notation .
Use the following syntax to declare a reference:
$(ref. RESOURCE_NAME . PATH_TO_PROPERTY )
For properties that are lists, such as the network interfaces for a
Compute Engine instances, use the following syntax:
$ ( ref . RESOURCE_NAME . LIST_PROPERTY [ index ] . ITEM )
Examples
$(ref.exampleInstance.networkInterfaces[0].natIp)
$(ref.exampleInstance.serviceAccounts[0].email)
Deployment-specific environment variables
When you create a deployment, Deployment Manager creates environment
variables that contain pieces of information about your deployment, such as
the current project name, the deployment's name, and so on.
For a full list of available environment variables, see
Environment variables .
To use an environment variable:
{{ env["deployment"] }} # Jinja
context.env["deployment"] # Python
Example
- type: compute.v1.instance
name: vm-{{ env["deployment"] }}
Template properties
A template property is an arbitrary property that you create. Instead of
hard-coding a value, you could declare a template property and set the value of
the property in the top-level configuration, as opposed to statically providing
the property and value directly in the template. To create a template property,
use the syntax:
{{ properties["property-name"] }} # Jinja
context.properties["property-name"] # Python
Then in your top-level configuration or parent template, set the value of the
property:
imports :
- path : vm_template . jinja
resources :
- name : my - vm
type : vm_template . jinja
properties :
property - name : example - value
Learn more about Template Properties .
Outputs
In the outputs section, you can define arbitrary key/value pairs that expose
certain information about your deployment. You provide the key and set the
value either as a static string, a reference to a property, a template variable,
or an environment variable.
outputs - Declares a list of outputs that users can call in their resource
properties.
name - Name of the output property.
value - Value of the output property.
Example
resources :
- name : vm - instance
type : compute . v1 . instance
...
outputs :
- name : databaseIp
value : $ ( ref . vm - instance . networkInterfaces [ 0 ]. natIp )
- name : databaseName
value : example - database
Learn more about
Outputs .
Metadata
The metadata section contains special metadata that you can apply on a
per-resource basis. Deployment Manager has unique metadata that triggers certain
features. For example, the dependsOn feature relies on a metadata entry.
Depends on
The dependsOn property creates explicit dependencies between your resources.
For example, specifying that Resource A depends on Resource B ensures that
Resource B is always created before Resource A.
metadata: the metadata for this resource
dependsOn: Any explicit dependencies to another resource.
Example
resources :
- name : vm - instance
type : compute . v1 . instance
properties :
machineType : zones / us - central1 - a / machineTypes / n1 - standard - 1
...
metadata :
dependsOn :
- persistent - disk - 1
- a - new - network - 1
Learn more about creating explicit dependencies .
Syntax for schemas
A schema is a way for you to control how your users can interact with your
templates. The following syntax can be used in your schema file.
Learn more about Schemas .
info
The info property contains meta information about the schema. This includes
information such as a title, a version number, a description and so on.
At a minimum, provide a title and description in this property.
Example
info:
title: MongoDB Template
author: Jane
description: Creates a MongoDB cluster
version: 1.0
imports
The imports field contains a list of corresponding files that are required for
templates that use this schema. When you upload a template with a schema that
has a list of imports, Deployment Manager checks that all of the files in the
imports property were uploaded along with the template.
Example
imports:
- path: helper.py
name: mongodb_helper.py
required
The required field contains a list of elements from the properties field that
are required in the template that uses the schema. Any elements not specified in
this required field are considered optional.
Example
required :
- name
properties :
name :
type : string
description : Name of your Mongo Cluster
size :
type : integer
default : 2
description : Number of Mongo Secondaries
properties
The properties field contains the JSON schema rules for this document.
Elements described in the properties field can be set by users of the template.
You can use all supported JSON schema validations for these properties, such as:
type (string, boolean, integer, number, ...)
default
minimum / exclusiveMinimum / maximum / exclusiveMaximum
minLength / maxLength
pattern
not X / allOf X, Y / anyOf X, Y / oneOf X, Y
At a minimum, it is good practice to include a type and description of the field
so users know what is an acceptable value for the property. For optional
properties, it is also good practice to include a default value.
Read the
JSON Schema Validation documentation for a list of validation keywords.
Example
properties :
name :
type : string
description : Name of your Mongo Cluster
size :
type : integer
default : 2
description : Number of Mongo Secondaries
minimum : 1
