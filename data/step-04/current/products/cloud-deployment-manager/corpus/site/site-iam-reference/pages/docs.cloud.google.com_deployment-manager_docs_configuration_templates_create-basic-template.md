Creating a Basic Template
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A basic configuration file might be enough for simple workloads but for more
complex architectures or for configurations that you plan to reuse, you can
break your configuration into templates.
A template is a separate file that is imported and used as a type in a
configuration. You can use as many templates as you want in a configuration.
Templates allow you to separate your configuration out into different pieces that
you can use and reuse across different deployments. Templates can be
as generalized or specific as you need. With templates, you can also take
advantage of features like template properties, environment variables, modules,
and other template functionality to create dynamic configuration and template
files.
For examples of templates that you can use in your own deployments,
see the Deployment Manager GitHub repository .
Before you begin
If you want to use the command-line examples in this guide, install the `gcloud` command-line tool .
If you want to use the API examples in this guide, set up API access .
Understand how to
create a basic configuration .
Template syntax
Templates can be written in either
Jinja 2.10.x
or Python 3.x .
Jinja maps more closely to the YAML syntax, so it might be easier to write
templates in Jinja if you are more familiar with YAML.
You can also write template files in Python and take advantage of Python to
programmatically generate parts of your templates. For example, you can use
Python libraries to format template definitions. If you are familiar with
Python, this might be a better format for you.
Deployment Manager accepts both Jinja and Python templates. You can
import templates in both languages in the same configuration.
Creating a basic template
A template is a file you create, written in either Jinja or Python. For example,
consider the following configuration file:
# Copyright 2016 Google Inc. All rights reserved.

# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

resources :
- name : vm-created-by-deployment-manager
type : compute.v1.instance
properties :
zone : us-central1-a
machineType : zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1
disks :
- deviceName : boot
type : PERSISTENT
boot : true
autoDelete : true
initializeParams :
sourceImage : projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-11
networkInterfaces :
- network : global/networks/default
This configuration is valid, but you can further simplify the configuration
by breaking different parts as individual template files that you can reuse. To
create a template based on the configuration above, pull out section for the
resource in question and create a new Jinja or Python file.
The following snippets show the sections of templates that can simplify
your deployment. For the full templates, click View on GitHub .
Jinja
- name: vm-template
type: compute.v1.instance
properties:
zone: us-central1-a
machineType: zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1
disks:
- deviceName: boot
type: PERSISTENT
boot: true
autoDelete: true
initializeParams:
sourceImage: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-11
networkInterfaces:
- network: global/networks/default
Python
Your Python templates must meet these requirements:
The template must define a method called GenerateConfig(context) or
generate_config(context) . If you use both method names in the same
template, the generate_config() method takes precedence.
The context object contains metadata about the deployment and your
environment, such as the deployment's name, the current project, and so
on. Learn more about using deployment-specific environment variables .
The method must return a Python dictionary .
Other than that, it is up to you to generate the contents of your template.
Example
resources . append ({
'name' : 'vm-template' ,
'type' : 'compute.v1.instance' ,
'properties' : {
'zone' : 'us-central1-a' ,
'machineType' : 'zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1' ,
'disks' : [{
'deviceName' : 'boot' ,
'type' : 'PERSISTENT' ,
'boot' : True ,
'autoDelete' : True ,
'initializeParams' : {
'sourceImage' :
'projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-11'
}
}],
'networkInterfaces' : [{
'network' : 'global/networks/default'
}]
}
})
For the full Python example, see the Deployment Manager GitHub repository .
Importing the template
After creating a template, import it into your configuration file to use it.
To import a template, add an imports section in your configuration, followed
by the relative or absolute path from the current directory. For example, you
can import your virtual machine template from the previous step by adding the
following line to the top of your configuration:
imports:
- path: path/to/my_vm_template.jinja
If you have a long file path, you can provide an optional name property as
an alias for the file. You can use this name to reference the template
later. If you do not provide the name, the template can be referenced using the
path .
imports:
- path: path/to/my_vm_template.jinja
name: my_renamed_template.jinja
Note: Template name and paths must end with a file extension, such as .py and
.jinja . Non-template file extensions are also accepted, like .txt .
You can mix and match imports of multiple templates, regardless of whether the
templates are Jinja or Python:
imports:
- path: path/to/my_vm_template.jinja
name: my_renamed_template.jinja
- path: special_vm.py
If your template uses other templates as dependencies, import the dependent
templates in your configuration as well:
imports:
- path: path/to/my_vm_template.jinja
- path: special_vm.py
- path: base_vm.jinja
You can also import text files in order to inline the content. For example, if
you create a file named resource_type.txt with the following string:
compute.v1.instance
Import it into your configuration and provide the content inline like so:
imports :
- path : resource_type.txt
resources :
- name : my-vm
type : {{ imports [ "resource_type.txt" ] }} # Resolves to "compute.v1.instance"
properties :
zone : us-central1-a
machineType : zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/f1-micro
disks :
- deviceName : boot
type : PERSISTENT
boot : true
autoDelete : true
initializeParams :
sourceImage : projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
networkInterfaces :
- network : global/networks/default
accessConfigs :
- name : External NAT
type : ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
Deploying templates
Once you import a template, use it as a type in your configuration:
Jinja
imports :
- path : vm-template.jinja
resources :
- name : my-vm
type : vm-template.jinja
Python
imports :
- path : vm-template.py
resources :
- name : my-vm
type : vm-template.py
If you did not provide a name for your template, call the template using the
template path:
imports :
- path : path / to / my_vm_template . jinja
resources :
- name : my - first - virtual - machine
type : path / to / my_vm_template . jinja
Deploying templates directly with the command-line tool
Instead of creating a top-level configuration file, Deployment Manager offers
the ability to deploy a template directly in the Google Cloud CLI.
For example, the following request deploys a template called vm-template.jinja :
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create a-single-vm --template vm-template.jinja
If your template has template properties ,
you can also set these properties on the command-line using the --properties
flag:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-igm \
--template vm-template.jinja \
--properties zone:us-central1-a
Keep in mind that:
All values are parsed as YAML values. For example, version: 3 is passed in
as an integer. If you want to specify it as a string, put escaped single
quotes around the value, version: \'3\' .
Boolean values are case insensitive, so TRUE , true , and True are treated
the same.
You must pass in all required properties defined by the template. You cannot
provide just a subset of the properties. If certain properties have default
values, you can omit the property from the command-line.
To specify multiple properties, provide comma-separated key:value pairs. It does
not matter in what order you specify the pairs. For example:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-igm
--template vm-template.jinja
--properties zone:us-central1-a,machineType:n1-standard-1,image:debian-9
After running this command, Deployment Manager creates a deployment using the
template you provided. You can confirm that the deployment has been created
using the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI. For information on viewing a
deployment, read
