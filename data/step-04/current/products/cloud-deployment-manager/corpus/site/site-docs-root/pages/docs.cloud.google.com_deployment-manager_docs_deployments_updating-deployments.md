Updating a Deployment
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
After you have created a deployment, you can update it as your application
or service changes. You can use Deployment Manager to update a deployment by:
Adding or removing resources from a deployment.
Updating the properties of existing resources in a deployment.
A single update can contain any combination of these changes. For example, you
can make changes to the properties of existing resources and add new
resources in the same request. You update your deployment by following these steps:
Make changes to or create a configuration file with the changes you want.
Optionally, pick the policies to use for your updates or use the default
policies.
Make the update request to Deployment Manager.
Before you begin
If you want to use the command-line examples in this guide, install the `gcloud` command-line tool .
If you want to use the API examples in this guide, set up API access .
Understand how to create deployments .
Prepare your update
Before updating your deployment, use these guidelines to prepare the update:
If you are updating your deployment to add new resources to your project,
check whether the resources already exist.
By default, if a resource that you want to add already exists in your project,
it is acquired by the deployment, without creating a new resource. If you do
not want to acquire an existing resource, you must change the policy to
use for the update.
For information on the policies you can use while updating deployments,
see Policies for adding resources .
If you are updating your deployment to replace a resource, check its
dependencies
If you want to replace a resource from your deployment, you must first
make sure that deleting it doesn't cause a deployment cycle . A
deployment cycle occurs when a resource depends on itself, either directly
or indirectly. For example, consider the following deployment:
resources:
- name: vm-a
properties:
zone: us-central1-f
...
metadata:
dependsOn:
- vm-depends-on
# The second VM
- name: vm-depends-on
properties:
zone: $(ref.vm-a.zone)
...
In this deployment, for vm-a , the dependsOn statement requires that
vm-depends-on must be created before vm-a . However, vm-depends-on uses
a reference to the zone for vm-a , which requires that vm-a must be
created before vm-depends-on . In such a scenario, the dependencies are
in a loop, and the deployment fails.
If you have resource that both depends on and is depended on by other
resources, replacing that resource might cause a deployment cycle.
For example, consider a deployment has a persistent disk called
disk-a , a VM called vm-a , and an instance group called ig-a . The
configuration for vm-a includes a reference to disk-a , and the
configuration for ig-a includes a reference to vm-a . In an updated
configuration, you want to remove vm-a and replace it with vm-b . In such
a scenario, resolving the dependencies for vm-a and vm-b can cause a
deployment cycle, and your deployment fails.
To avoid deployment cycles when you want to replace a resource in a chain
of dependencies, do one of the following:
Remove the dependencies for the resource you want to replace, either
by removing the dependsOn clause, or by removing or changing references
to other resources. After you have updated the deployment with these
changes, make another update to replace the resource.
Delete the chain of dependent resources, and update the deployment. Then,
in the next update, re-create the resources that you want to use.
Ensure that there is an underlying API that supports your update.
Deployment Manager uses the APIs of each service to create and modify
your deployments. To check that your request can be completed by Deployment
Manager, review the API documentation of the Cloud Platform service for the
resources that you want to update.
For example, if you want to update a BigQuery dataset in your
deployment, see the available methods in the
Datasets API reference .
The methods include an update method, which indicates that you can update
the dataset using Deployment Manager.
Some APIs have custom methods for updating their resources. For example,
Compute Engine offers a custom method for updating an instance’s metadata
called setMetadata . In such cases, Deployment Manager attempts to use the
custom methods.
Ensure that the resources you are updating are mutable.
Some resources are immutable after they have been created, and they cannot
be updated. To determine whether a resource is immutable, see the API
reference for the resource. Typically, an immutable resource lacks an
update API method or a custom method to update the properties of the resource.
Limitations
For each deployment, you can apply one update at a time. If an update is
already in progress, you must stop the current update
before starting a new update.
If you modified a resource in a deployment without using
Deployment Manager, such as in the Google Cloud console or gcloud ,
you might see errors or unexpected issues when you try to modify the resource
in an update.
Make changes to your configuration
If you saved an existing configuration, make changes to the configuration
and use that in your update request.
If you do not have an existing configuration saved, create a new
configuration. For steps to create a configuration file, read
Configurations .
Deployment Manager compares the configuration you provide in your update
request to the previous manifest and use the differences to update your
deployment.
For example, the following table shows two configurations: one describes an
existing deployment and one describes the desired updated state of the
deployment. You provide the updated configuration and Deployment Manager
evaluates the differences and makes the appropriate updates.
This example updates an existing instance resource to include some custom
metadata and also adds a new virtual machine resource to the deployment.
The parts in bold are differences between the templates.
Note: For readability, the example replaces URLs with placeholders. In practice,
you need to provide URLs for these properties, such as the machine type.

(Optional) Determine the policies to use for the update
Next, determine what policies you want to use for the update. The policy determines
how your resources are updated when you update the deployment.
Note: If you want to see your updated deployment before committing any changes,
you can preview your configuration .
Deployment Manager uses these default policies:
The default policy for adding resources is CREATE_OR_ACQUIRE .
The default policy for removing resources is DELETE .
The default policy for updating resources is UPDATE .
For information on each policy, review the sections below.
Policies for adding resources
When adding resources, you can choose to create a new resource and add it to a
deployment or you can acquire an existing resource:
CREATE_OR_ACQUIRE - [Default] Deployment Manager acquires
resources that exist in the project, or creates resources if they do not
exist. To acquire a resource, Deployment Manager checks your configuration
for the properties of the resource you are trying to create. If there is an
existing resource with the same properties, Deployment Manager acquires that
resource as part of your deployment.
The properties that Deployment Manager checks depend on the type of resource
you are creating, and might include:
The name of the resource
The type of the resource
The zone or region of the resource, if applicable
The properties are part of the URL for GET API request for the resource.
To see which properties Deployment Manager uses to acquire a resource,
see the API documentation for the resource's GET method. For example,
for Compute Engine instances, the request URL for
instances.get method
includes the resourceId ( name in your configuration), zone , and
project .
Note: If you want to acquire a resource and then update it, we
recommend first providing all the current properties of the resource,
as if you were creating it. After the resource is acquired,
to update the resource, change the resource's properties in your
configuration and run the update command again.
CREATE - Deployment Manager creates resources that do not exist. If any of
the resources in your configuration already exist in the project, the
deployment fails.
ACQUIRE - Deployment Manager acquires resources that already exist, using
the same criteria as CREATE_OR_ACQUIRE .
Use the ACQUIRE policy if you have a number of resources already in your
project, and want to manage them together, as a single deployment.
In your template or configuration, you must provide the required
properties for these resources as if you are creating them. If any of
the resources in your configuration do not exist in the project, the
deployment fails.
Warning: Do not acquire resources that are already part of another
deployment. If you do, any changes you make to one deployment can cause
unexpected behavior with the resources in the other deployment.
Policies for removing resources
Provide one of the following policies for removing resources:
DELETE - [Default] This removes any references to the resource from the
deployment and deletes the underlying resource. This is permanent and cannot be
undone, but you can recreate a new resource with the same properties.
ABANDON - This removes any references to the resource from the deployment but
does not delete the underlying resource. For example, abandoning an instance
means that it is removed from a deployment but the instance still exists for you
to use.
The ABANDON policy only applies when you delete entire resources, not when
you delete the properties of a resource, or update a resource with new
properties. If you want to preserve the properties of a resource, you must
include the resource with all its original properties in your updated
configuration. If you're using a new configuration file for your update,
we recommend copying the resource's definition from your original
configuration.
Policies for updating an existing resource
If an UPDATE method exists for updating existing resources, Deployment Manager
uses that.
Otherwise, if a custom method exists, Deployment Manager uses the custom method.
Deployment Manager supports custom methods that use the verb set . For example,
setMetadata() is a valid custom method, but addAccessConfigs() is not.
(Optional) Preview an updated configuration
You can preview the update you want to make before committing any changes,
with the Google Cloud CLI or the API. The Deployment Manager service
previews the configuration by expanding the full configuration and creating "shell"
resources.
Deployment Manager does not instantiate any actual resources when you
preview a configuration, giving you the opportunity to see the deployment before
committing to it.
gcloud
With the Google Cloud CLI, make an update request with the --preview parameter:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments update example-deployment \
--config configuration-file.yaml \
--preview
API
In the API, create a PUT()
request with an existing deployment and provide the preview=true query
parameter. The request body must contain the intent , target , and name
fields. Provide the deployment name in both the URL and in the request body.
For example, the following API request previews a simple update:
PUT https : //www.googleapis.com/deploymentmanager/v2/projects/myproject/global/deployments/example-deployment?preview=true
{
"target" : {
"config" : {
"content" : "resources:\n- name: vm-created-by-cloud-config\n type: compute.v1.instance\n properties:\n zone: us-central1-a\n machineType: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1\n disks:\n - deviceName: boot\n type: PERSISTENT\n boot: true\n autoDelete: true\n initializeParams:\n diskName: disk-created-by-cloud-config\n sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-v20180716\n networkInterfaces:\n - network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/default"
}
},
"name" : "example-deployment"
}
After previewing a deployment, you can fully deploy the configuration by making
the same PUT() request, omitting both the configuration and the
preview query parameter. Deployment Manager uses your last preview to perform
the update. For example:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments update example-deployment
For steps to make an update request, see Make the update request .
If you decide not to continue with the update, cancel the current preview
before making another update or preview request.
Cancel a preview
After you preview an update, you must decide if you want to continue with
the update. If you do not want to continue, or if you want to use a different
configuration file to update the deployment, cancel the current preview.
gcloud
With the Google Cloud CLI, make a deployments cancel-preview request:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments cancel-preview my-first-deployment
API
In the API, make a PUT() request to the cancelPreview
method and provide the latest deployment fingerprint. A fingerprint
is a randomly generated value that changes with each update request. To
prevent errors during the update, provide the latest fingerprint with your
request.
To get the latest fingerprint of a deployment, use the
get() method to get a
deployment, and look for the fingerprint value. The fingerprint value
looks like this:
"fingerprint": "nU2v7bzeA7gBBI8bdbtmFg=="
Your cancelPreview() request looks like this:
POST https://www.googleapis.com/deploymentmanager/v2/projects/myproject/global/deployments/example-deployment/cancelPreview
{
"fingerprint": "nU2v7bzeA7gBBI8bdbtmFg=="
}
Make the update request
To perform the update:
gcloud
With the Google Cloud CLI, use the deployments update subcommand,
providing a new configuration and optionally, your update policies.
gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-first-deployment \
--create-policy POLICY \
--delete-policy POLICY
If you previously
previewed
a configuration, omit the configuration and Deployment Manager uses the last
previewed configuration to perform the update.
gcloud deployment-manager deployments update my-first-deployment
API
In the API, make an update
request and provide the latest deployment fingerprint. A fingerprint
is a randomly generated value that changes with each update request. To
prevent errors during the update, provide the latest fingerprint with your
request.
To get the latest fingerprint of a deployment, use the
get() method to get a
deployment, and look for the fingerprint value. The fingerprint value
looks like this:
"fingerprint": "nU2v7bzeA7gBBI8bdbtmFg=="
Next, provide the fingerprint in your request, along with
with your new configuration and update policies.
If you previously
previewed
the configuration, omit the configuration and update policies, and
Deployment Manager uses the last previewed configuration to perform the
update.
Provide the deployment name in both the URL and in the request body.
PUT https : //www.googleapis.com/deploymentmanager/v2/projects/myproject/global/deployments/example-deployment?createPolicy=ACQUIRE&deletePolicy=ABANDON
{
"target" : {
"config" : {
"content" : "resources:\n- name: vm-created-by-cloud-config\n type: compute.v1.instance\n properties:\n zone: us-central1-a\n machineType: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1\n disks:\n - deviceName: boot\n type: PERSISTENT\n boot: true\n autoDelete: true\n initializeParams:\n diskName: disk-created-by-cloud-config\n sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-v20180716\n networkInterfaces:\n - network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/default"
}
},
"name" : "example-deployment" ,
"fingerprint" : "nU2v7bzeA7gBBI8bdbtmFg=="
}
Stop an update
You can stop an update that is in progress using the stop() .
method. This cancels any further progress from a particular update, but does not
undo any change that have already been made.
If you are trying to cancel a preview, see the Cancel a preview
section.
gcloud
With the Google Cloud CLI, make a deployments stop request:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments stop my-first-deployment
API
In the API, make a POST() request to the
stop method and provide
the latest fingerprint property. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value
that changes with each update request. In order to prevent conflicting
changes, you must provide the latest fingerprint with your request, to
perform optimistic locking so that only one update can be made at a time.
To get the latest fingerprint of a deployment, use the
get() method to get a
deployment, and look for the fingerprint value. The fingerprint value
looks like this:
"fingerprint": "nU2v7bzeA7gBBI8bdbtmFg=="
Your request looks like this:
POST https://www.googleapis.com/deploymentmanager/v2/projects/myproject/global/deployments/example-deployment/stop
{
"fingerprint": "nU2v7bzeA7gBBI8bdbtmFg=="
}
