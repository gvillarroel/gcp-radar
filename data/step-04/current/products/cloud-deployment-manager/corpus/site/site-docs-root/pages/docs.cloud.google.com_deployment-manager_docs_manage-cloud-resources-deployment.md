Manage Google Cloud resources as a deployment
You can use Google Cloud Deployment Manager to create a set of Google Cloud resources and
manage them as a unit, called a deployment . For example, if your team's
development environment needs two virtual machines (VMs) and a BigQuery
database, you can define these resources in a configuration file, and use
Deployment Manager to create, change, or delete these resources. You can
make the configuration file part of your team's code repository, so that anyone
can create the same environment with consistent results.
In this tutorial, you'll use Google Cloud Deployment Manager to create a virtual machine (VM)
instance. You'll define the VM in a basic configuration file, and use that
configuration file to create a deployment.
To complete this tutorial, you must be comfortable running commands in a Linux,
macOS, or Windows terminal.
For an interactive version of this tutorial, open it in Cloud Shell, where you
can edit the sample configuration and deploy your resources without installing
anything on your workstation. If you want to follow the tutorial on your own
computer, skip to the next section.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

Enable the Deployment Manager and Compute Engine APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
On your workstation, install the Google Cloud CLI .
Configure the Google Cloud CLI to use your project. In the following command, replace
[MY_PROJECT] with your project ID:
gcloud config set project [MY_PROJECT]
Define your resources
You describe your resources in a configuration file, which is written in the
YAML syntax.
Copy the sample configuration below, and paste it into a text editor.

# Put all your resources under `resources:`. For each resource, you need:
# - The type of resource. In this example, the type is a Compute VM instance.
# - An internal name for the resource.
# - The properties for the resource. In this example, for VM instances, you add
# the machine type, a boot disk, network information, and so on.
#
# For a list of supported resources,
# see https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/configuration/supported-resource-types.
resources :
- type : compute.v1.instance
name : quickstart-deployment-vm
properties :
# The properties of the resource depend on the type of resource. For a list
# of properties, see the API reference for the resource.
zone : us-central1-f
# Replace [MY_PROJECT] with your project ID
machineType : https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[MY_PROJECT]/zones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/f1-micro
disks :
- deviceName : boot
type : PERSISTENT
boot : true
autoDelete : true
initializeParams :
# See a full list of image families at https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images#os-compute-support
# The format of the sourceImage URL is: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[IMAGE_PROJECT]/global/images/family/[FAMILY_NAME]
sourceImage : https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-11
# Replace [MY_PROJECT] with your project ID
networkInterfaces :
- network : https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[MY_PROJECT]/global/networks/default
# Access Config required to give the instance a public IP address
accessConfigs :
- name : External NAT
type : ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
This basic configuration file describes a deployment that contains one
virtual machine instance with the following properties:
Machine type: f1-micro
Image family: debian-11
Zone: us-central1-f
Root persistent disk: boot
A randomly assigned external IP address
Replace all instances of [MY_PROJECT] with your project ID.
Save the file as vm.yaml .
Deploy the resources
To deploy your resources, use the Google Cloud CLI to create a new
deployment, using your configuration file:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create quickstart-deployment --config vm.yaml
If the deployment is successful, you receive a message similar to the following
example:
Create operation operation-1432319707382-516afeb5d00f1-b864f0e7-b7103978 completed successfully.
NAME TYPE STATE ERRORS
quickstart-deployment compute.v1.instance COMPLETED -
You now have your first deployment!
Check on your new deployment
To check the status of the deployment, run the following command:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments describe quickstart-deployment
You see a description of the deployment, including its start and
end time, the resources created, and any warnings or errors:

After you have created the deployment, you can review your resources in
Google Cloud console.
To see a list of your deployments, open the Deployment Manager page.
Go to Deployment Manager
To see the resources in the deployment, click quickstart-deployment . The
deployment overview opens, with information about the deployment, and the
resources that are part of the deployment.
To see information about your VM, click quickstart-deployment-vm .
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete quickstart-deployment
Type y at the prompt:
The following deployments will be deleted:
- quickstart-deployment
Do you want to continue (y/N)?
The deployment and the resources you created are permanently deleted.
