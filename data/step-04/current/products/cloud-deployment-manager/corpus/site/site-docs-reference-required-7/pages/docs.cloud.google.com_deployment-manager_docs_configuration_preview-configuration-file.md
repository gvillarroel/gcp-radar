Previewing a configuration
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to preview a configuration file before creating a
deployment. To learn more about configurations, read Configurations Overview .
After you have written a configuration file ,
you can preview the configuration before you create a deployment. Previewing
a configuration lets you see the resources that Deployment Manager would create
but does not actually instantiate any actual resources. The
Deployment Manager service previews the configuration by:
Expanding the full configuration, including any templates.
Creating a deployment and "shell" resources.
You can preview your configuration by using the preview query parameter when
making an insert()
request.
Before you begin
If you want to use the command-line examples in this guide, install the `gcloud` command-line tool .
If you want to use the API examples in this guide, set up API access .
Understand how to
create a basic configuration .
Previewing a new configuration
Preview a configuration by using the Google Cloud CLI or by making a
direct request to the API.
gcloud
If you're using the Google Cloud CLI, use the create sub-command
with the --preview flag:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create example-config --config configuration-file.yaml \
--preview
The server returns a list of resources whose state is IN_PREVIEW for you
to review:
The fingerprint of the deployment is ulPDrJON8E5ySHKC5fcukw==
Waiting for create [operation-1492785372594-54dae2ddbff50-58d45d53-12d483cf]...done.

NAME TYPE STATE ERRORS INTENT
datadisk-example compute.v1.disk IN_PREVIEW [] CREATE_OR_ACQUIRE
vm-example compute.v1.instance IN_PREVIEW [] CREATE_OR_ACQUIRE
API
In the API, use the insert()
method with a request body that contains the target and name fields and
the preview=true query parameter. Provide your configuration in the
target field.
For example, the following API request previews a simple template:
POST https : //www.googleapis.com/deploymentmanager/v2/projects/myproject/global/deployments?preview=true
{
"name" : "example-config" ,
"target" : {
"config" : {
"content" : "resources:\n- name: vm-created-by-cloud-config\n type: compute.v1.instance\n properties:\n zone: us-central1-a\n machineType: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1\n disks:\n - deviceName: boot\n type: PERSISTENT\n boot: true\n autoDelete: true\n initializeParams:\n diskName: disk-created-by-cloud-config\n sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-7-wheezy-v20140619\n networkInterfaces:\n networkInterfaces:\n - network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/default"
}
}
}
When a deployment is in preview mode, you can move forward with the deployment in
one of three ways:
Deploy the configuration by performing an update .
Cancel the preview and then delete the deployment.
Update the preview .
Performing multiple previews
If you want to change your configuration and perform another preview,
use the update command with the --preview flag:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments update example-config \
--config new-config.yaml --preview
In the API, make a
PUT()
request with an existing deployment and provide the preview=true query
parameter. The request body must contain the intent , target , and name
fields. For example, the following API request previews a simple update:
PUT https : //www.googleapis.com/deploymentmanager/v2/projects/myproject/global/deployments/example-config?preview=true
{
"target" : {
"config" : {
"content" : "resources:\n- name: vm-created-by-cloud-config\n type: compute.v1.instance\n properties:\n zone: us-central1-a\n machineType: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-1\n disks:\n - deviceName: boot\n type: PERSISTENT\n boot: true\n autoDelete: true\n initializeParams:\n diskName: disk-created-by-cloud-config\n sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-7-wheezy-v20140619\n networkInterfaces:\n - network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/default"
}
},
"name" : "example-config"
}
Note: In the API, you need to provide the deployment name in both the URL
and in the request body.
Deploying or canceling a preview
After previewing a deployment, you can move forward with the deployment by
performing an update and committing the configuration. For example, assume you
have a deployment named example-config currently in preview mode. You can move
forward with the deployment by running the following command:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments update example-config
Deployment Manager uses the last previewed configuration to create a
deployment.
Alternatively, if you don't want to move forward with the configuration, you can
cancel the preview, and then delete the deployment:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments cancel-preview example-config
Note: If you perform many previews without canceling or moving forward with
any of them, you will end up with many empty deployments. Make sure to
cancel
and delete the deployments that you previewed but no longer need once you are
done with them.
While a deployment is in preview mode, you cannot move forward with another
configuration. For example, assume you have a deployment called
example-config that is in preview mode using a configuration named
vm.yaml . You decide that you want to deploy a new configuration named
two_vms.yaml to the same deployment, skipping the preview process. While
example-config is still in preview mode, you cannot deploy a new
configuration. Cancel the preview, and then
update the deployment
with the new configuration.
