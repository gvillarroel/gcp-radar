Defining Template Properties
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
One of the advantages of using templates
is the ability to create and define custom template properties. Template
properties are arbitrary variables that you define in template files. Any
configuration file or template file that uses the template in question can
provide a value for the template property without changing the template
directly. This lets you abstract the property so that you can change the property's
value for each unique configuration without updating the underlying template.
For example, the following line specifies a template property in the
machine type's URL:
machineType: zones/ {{ properties [ "zone" ] }} /machineTypes/n1-standard-1
In a configuration that uses this template, you can set the value of zone
in the properties section of the template:
imports :
- path : vm_template . jinja
resources :
- name : my - vm
type : vm_template . jinja
properties :
zone : us - central1 - a
Deployment Manager will know to pass in the value of zone to the underlying
template.
Before you begin
If you want to use the command-line examples in this guide, install the `gcloud` command-line tool .
If you want to use the API examples in this guide, set up API access .

Creating a template property
To create a template property:
Jinja
In Jinja, define a property using the following syntax:
{{ properties [ "PROJECT_NAME" ] }}
For example:
- name: vm-{{ env["deployment"] }}
type: compute.v1.instance
properties:
zone: us-central1-a
machineType: zones/{{ properties["zone"] }}/machineTypes/n1-standard-1
disks:
- deviceName: boot
type: PERSISTENT
boot: true
autoDelete: true
initializeParams:
sourceImage: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-11
networkInterfaces:
- network: global/networks/default
Python
In Python, define a property using the following syntax:
context . properties [ "PROPERTY_NAME" ]
For example:
resources . append ({
'name' : 'vm-' + context . env [ 'deployment' ],
'type' : 'compute.v1.instance' ,
'properties' : {
'zone' : 'us-central1-a' ,
'machineType' : '' . join ([ 'zones/' , context . properties [ 'zone' ],
'/machineTypes/n1-standard-1' ]),
'disks' : [{
'deviceName' : 'boot' ,
'type' : 'PERSISTENT' ,
'boot' : True ,
'autoDelete' : True ,
'initializeParams' : {
'sourceImage' :
'projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-11'
}
}],
'networkInterfaces' : [{
'network' : 'global/networks/default'
}]
}
})
For the full Python example, see the Deployment Manager GitHub repository .
Setting values for template properties on the top-level config
On the top-level configuration, you can set values for template properties using
the syntax:
imports :
- path : vm_template . jinja
resources :
- name : my - vm
type : vm_template . jinja
properties :
zone : us - central1 - a
You must set values for all template properties in the template. For example,
if a template has template properties zone , image , network , you must
define values for all of those properties in the top-level configuration.
If certain template properties have default values, consider using
schemas
to set these default values. A template property with a default value can
be omitted from the top-level configuration if the default value is appropriate
for the deployment.
Setting values for template properties on the command-line
Instead of supplying values for template properties in the parent file importing
the template, Deployment Manager offers the ability to set these values directly
in the Google Cloud CLI. You can skip creating the top-level YAML
file; Deployment Manager will automatically generate a top-level configuration
for your deployment based on the information in your request.
For example, assume you have the following template which has a template
property called zone :
- name : vm - {{ env["deployment"] } }
type : compute . v1 . instance
properties :
zone : us - central1 - a
machineType : zones / {{ properties["zone"] } } / machineTypes / n1 - standard - 1
disks :
- deviceName : boot
type : PERSISTENT
boot : true
autoDelete : true
initializeParams :
sourceImage : projects / debian - cloud / global / images / family / debian - 11
networkInterfaces :
- network : global / networks / default
With the Google Cloud CLI, you can pass in this template file directly
and provide the values for your template properties on the command-line. For
example, the following request passes in the template and specifies the
zone property directly on the command-line:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create a-single-vm --template vm_template.jinja \
--properties zone:us-central1-a
Keep in mind that:
All values are parsed as YAML values. For example, version: 3 is passed in
as an integer. If you want to specify it as a string, put escaped single
quotes around the value, version: \'3\' .
Boolean values are case insensitive, so TRUE , true , and True are treated
the same.
You must pass in all required properties defined by the template. You cannot
provide just a subset of the properties. If certain properties have default
values, you can omit the property from the command-line.
To specify multiple properties, provide comma-separated key:value pairs. It does
not matter in what order you specify the pairs. For example:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-igm \
--template vm_template.jinja \
--properties zone:us-central1-a,machineType:n1-standard-1,image:debian-9
After running this command, Deployment Manager creates a deployment using the
template you provided. You can confirm that the deployment has been created
using the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI. For information on viewing a
deployment, read
