Understanding configurations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A configuration defines the structure of your deployment. You must specify a
configuration to create a deployment.
In this step, you will access a configuration that creates a deployment with two
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances. A VM instance is one of
several kinds of resources you can deploy with Deployment Manager.
In this step, you'll examine a configuration for a deployment with
two VM instances.
Open the configuration YAML file
Change to the directory you created in
Installation and setup :
cd deploymentmanager-samples/examples/v2/step_by_step_guide/step2_create_a_configuration
Then, open two-vms.yaml :
nano two-vms.yaml # use your preferred text editor
In the resources section, note that there are two resources: the-first-vm
and the-second-vm . Each resource has a name , type , and properties
field:
name : A name that you define for the resource.
type : Specifies what type of resource you're creating. For example, a VM
is compute.v1.instance . Similarly, a Cloud SQL
instance has the type sql.v1beta4.instance .
properties : Specifies the properties of the resource. The properties
required to create the resource are the same properties required by the
resource's API. For example, when you create a Compute Engine VM
instance, you must provide a machine type, an image, a network interface,
and a boot disk specification.
Set up the configuration file
In two-vms.yaml , replace MY_PROJECT with your project
ID.

Save your changes
This basic configuration file is all you need to create your first deployment.
You declared the resources that you want to create (in this case, two VM
instances that had different machine types), and Deployment Manager takes
care of creating the resources.
In the next step, you use this configuration to deploy new resources.
