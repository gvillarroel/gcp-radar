Sharing Types Across Projects
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Beta
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This page describes how to share
types and type providers that
belong to your project with other projects. For example, assume you have a
project that is responsible for maintaining pre-approved type providers for your
company. You want to be able to share these type providers from that project
with other projects and to use the project as a central repository of types.
Similarly, you can also use this method to share composite types across
projects.
To set up access, a project owner from the project that owns the type
will need to grant the deploymentmanager.typeViewer (beta) role to the service
account of the project that wants to consume the types. They also need to
grant the role to users who want to view and list types from another project..
Before you begin
If you want to use the command-line examples in this guide, install the `gcloud` command-line tool .
If you want to use the API examples in this guide, set up API access .
Read about Deployment Manager configurations .
Read about Types .
Read the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
documentation.
Limitations
The following are restrictions for using this feature:
Granting the deploymentmanager.typeViewer role grants permissions to
all types in the specific project. It is not possible to limit sharing to
individual types.
It is not possible to grant this role to
allAuthenticatedUsers or
allUsers .
Granting a project access to use types
To grant access to types that belong to other projects, the owner of the
project that owns the types in question must grant the deploymentmanager.typeViewer
role to the
Google APIs service account
of the project that wants to consume the types.
Go to the IAM page in the Google Cloud console of the project that will
be consuming the types.
Go to the IAM page
If prompted, select your project from the list.
Look for the Google APIs service account , which has the email
address in the following format:
[ PROJECT_NUMBER ] @cloudservices . gserviceaccount.com
Note: This email address requires the project number, not the
project ID. To learn how to identify the project number, see
Identifying projects .
Make note of the email address above. Next, a project owner of the project
where the desired types live can grant the Google APIs service account
the roles/deploymentmanager.typeViewer role.
Console
While still in the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page of the project
that contains the types you want to share.
Go to the IAM page
Select the project from the project list.
Click the Add button to add a new member.
In the Members box, enter the email address of the service account.
Expand the Roles dropdown and select Other > Deployment Manager Types Viewer (beta) .
Click Add to add the account.
gcloud
With the Google Cloud CLI, add a binding to the IAM policy for the project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \
--member serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] --role roles/deploymentmanager.typeViewer
where:
[PROJECT_ID] is the ID of the project containing images you want to
share.
[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] is the email of the service account in the
project you want to share types with.
For example:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding database-images \
--member serviceAccount:123456789012@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com \
--role roles/deploymentmanager.typeViewer
API
In the API, make a POST request to the following URL, where
[PROJECT_ID] is the ID of the project containing the types you want to
share.
POST https : // cloudresourcemanager . googleapis . com / v1 / projects / $ [ PROJECT_ID ] : setIamPolicy
The request body should contain the list of bindings you want to apply
to this project. The roles/deploymentmanager.typeViewer role should be part
of the binding. For example:
{
"policy" : {
"version" : "0" ,
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : "roles/owner" ,
"members" : [
"user:example@gmail.com"
]
},
{
"role" : "roles/deploymentmanager.typeViewer" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:123456789012@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com"
]
}
]
}
}
Using types from other projects in your configuration
Once you have access to your types, you can specify the type in
configurations using the syntax. For
composite types :
type : [ PROJECT_ID ]/ composite : [ TYPE ]
For type providers :
type : [ PROJECT_ID ]/[ TYPE ] : [ COLLECTION ]
Where:
[PROJECT_ID] is the project ID that owns the type.
[TYPE] is the name of the type provider or the composite type.
[COLLECTION] is the specific resource you are creating. This is only
applicable for base types. For more information on specifying base types,
read Calling a Type Provider in a Configuration .
For example, if the project ID is my-type-repository , then you might
provide the following type specification:
resources:
- name: a-special-vm
type: my-type-repository/composite:autoscaled-igm
properties:
...
Granting users the ability to list and view types
Granting the project's service account the deploymentmanager.typeViewer role
allows the project to deploy these types in your configurations but does not
allow users to view or list these types. If you want to grant individual users
to ability to view types, you must grant the deploymentmanager.typeViewer
role to each user.
For example, in order for Jane to run the
gcloud beta deployment-manager types list --project another-project
command for a project that doesn't belong to her, the owner of another-project
must grant Jane the deploymentmanager.typeViewer role.
Using the gcloud CLI, you can grant Jane the role like so:
gcloud projects add - iam - policy - binding another - project \
-- member user : jane @ gmail . com -- role deploymentmanager . typeViewer
For comprehensive instructions on adding and removing roles from users,
read the documentation for
granting, changing, and revoking access to project members .
