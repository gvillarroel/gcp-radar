Cloud Deployment Manager will reach end of support on March 31, 2026 . If you currently use Deployment Manager, please migrate to Infrastructure Manager or an alternative deployment technology by March 31, 2026 to ensure your services continue without interruption.
For more information on the deprecation and shutdown, see Deployment Manager deprecation .

Setting template properties and using environment variables
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
One advantage of using templates for your deployment is the ability to create
and define custom properties, which let you reuse templates across zones,
regions, and projects.
Template properties are arbitrary variables. Any configuration file or
template file can provide a value for a template property without modifying the
template. Therefore, you can change a property's value for various
configurations without changing the template itself.
To reference an arbitrary value, use this syntax in a template:
context.properties["property-name"]
In addition to template properties, you can also use environment variables
specific to your deployment, which are pre-populated with information about the
deployment. You can use environment variables in templates to get unique
information about your deployment.
You call an environment variable by using this syntax:
context . env [ 'variable-name' ]
Valid environment variables include the deployment name, the project ID, the
name property of your resource, and the type of your configuration.
Learn more about environment variables .
Template properties and environment variables in a template
In this step, vm-template.py shows the benefits of template properties and
environment variables. Open vm-template.py :
cd deploymentmanager-samples/examples/v2/step_by_step_guide/step7_use_environment_variables/python
nano vm-template.py # use your preferred text editor
Various parts of the template have been replaced with template properties and
environment variables. For example, the project ID is replaced with
context.env[project] , so you don't have to manually replace the project ID in
your templates.
The comments in the file describe other changes to the template.

resources = [{

}]
}]
}
}]
return { 'resources' : resources }
Similarly, network-template.py and firewall-template.py use the deployment's
name in their definition, by calling context.env['name'] .
Deploying the configuration
To view the configuration file for this deployment, run the following command:
nano config-with-many-templates.yaml
Save your changes and redeploy your configuration to confirm the variables work.
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create deployment-with-template-properties --config config-with-many-templates.yaml
Deleting your deployment
We recommend that you delete the deployment to avoid charges. You don't need
this deployment for the next step. Run the following command to delete the
deployment:
gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete deployment-with-template-properties
