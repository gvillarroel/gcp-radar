Cloud Deployment Manager will reach end of support on March 31, 2026 . If you currently use Deployment Manager, please migrate to Infrastructure Manager or an alternative deployment technology by March 31, 2026 to ensure your services continue without interruption.

Using Template Modules
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Template modules are helper files that perform specific functions that can make
your templates more efficient. For example, you can have a module that generates
unique names for your resources. Deployment Manager can execute any module written
in Python or Jinja.
Before you begin
If you want to use the command-line examples in this guide, install the `gcloud` command-line tool .
If you want to use the API examples in this guide, set up API access .
Understand how to
create a basic template .
Understand how to create a configuration
Creating a template module
A template module is treated as a regular template file and can be written in
Jinja or Python.
For example, the following is a helper template that generates a name
given a prefix and suffix.
Jinja
In Jinja, this helper template (in this example, named helpers/common.jinja)
would look like the following:
{% - macro GenerateMachineName ( prefix = '' , suffix = '' ) - %}
{{ prefix + "-" + suffix }}
{% - endmacro %}
You can then import this template and use it as a module. In your Jinja
template, you could use the module like so:

{% import 'helpers/common.jinja' as common %}
resources:
- name: {{ common.GenerateMachineName("myfrontend", "prod") }}
type: compute.v1.instance
properties:
zone: us-central1-f
machineType: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{{ env['project'] }}/zones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/f1-micro
disks:
- deviceName: boot
type: PERSISTENT
boot: true
autoDelete: true
initializeParams:
sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-11
networkInterfaces:
- network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{{ env['project'] }}/global/networks/default
accessConfigs:
- name: External NAT
type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
The configuration must then import both files
(including the helpers/common.jinja file):

imports :
- path : helpers/common.jinja
- path : vm-instance-example.jinja
resources :
- name : my-vm
type : vm-instance-example.jinja
The Deployment Manager service will expand the configuration and the
final configuration looks like this:
resources:
- name: myfrontend-prod
type: compute.v1.instance
properties:
zone: us-central1-f
machineType: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/zones/us-central1-f/machineTypes/f1-micro
disks:
- deviceName: boot
type: PERSISTENT
boot: true
autoDelete: true
initializeParams:
sourceImage: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
networkInterfaces:
- network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/default
accessConfigs:
- name: External NAT
type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
Python
In Python, the helper template (in this example, named helpers/common.py)
would look like this:
