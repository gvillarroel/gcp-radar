Using Schemas
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A schema describes the specifications of a Deployment Manager template. If a
schema exists for a template, Deployment Manager uses the schema to enforce how
users can interact with the corresponding template. Schemas define a set of
rules that a configuration file must meet if it wants to use a particular template.
In addition to defining the rules of a template, schemas also allow your users
to interface with the templates you write, without needing to review and learn
about each layer of templates. Users can simply review the requirements defined
in your schema instead to learn what properties are settable or required for the
respective template.
For example, you could create a schema where the corresponding template must always
define a specific set of required properties, and each of these properties have
their own specifications. One property must be a string, another must be an
integer that is less than 100, and so on. If a user wants to apply your template
in their configuration, the user reviews the schema and sets the correct
properties in their configuration.
Before you begin
If you want to use the command-line examples in this guide, install the `gcloud` command-line tool .
If you want to use the API examples in this guide, set up API access .
Understand how to
create a basic template .
Understand how to create a configuration
Understand JSON Schema .
Example schema
The example schema is written for the Jinja templating engine. If you're
using a different templating engine, your file extensions are different and
the template syntax can be different.
This is a simple schema file named vm-instance-with-network.jinja.schema :
info :
title : VM Template
author : Jane
description : Creates a new network and instance
version : 1.0
imports :
- path : vm - instance . jinja # Must be a relative path
required :
- IPv4Range
properties :
IPv4Range :
type : string
description : Range of the network
description :
type : string
default : "My super great network"
description : Description of network
The schema applies to this template, vm-instance-with-network.jinja :
resources :
- name : vm - 1
type : vm - instance . jinja
- name : a - new - network
type : compute . v1 . network
properties :
IPv4Range : {{ properties [ ' IPv4Range ' ] }}
description : {{ properties [ ' description ' ] }}
If a user wanted to use this template in their configuration, they can review
the schema to learn that there is one required property they must define
( IPv4Range ) and one optional property ( description ) that they can omit or
include. A user might then create a configuration file like so, making sure to
provide a property named IPv4Range :
imports :
- path : vm - instance - with - network . jinja
resources :
- name : vm - 1
type : vm - instance - with - network . jinja
properties :
IPv4Range : 10.0.0.1 / 16
Structure of a schema
Below is an example schema document. Deployment Manager recommends that schemas
be written in YAML format, but you can also write schemas in JSON and it will
be accepted by Deployment Manager.
Deployment Manager accepts schemas written according to draft 4 of the
JSON schema specifications .
< mongodb . py . schema >
info :
title : MongoDB Template
author : Jane
description : Creates a MongoDB cluster
version : 1.0
imports :
- path : helper . py
name : mongodb_helper . py
required :
- name
properties :
name :
type : string
description : Name of your Mongo Cluster
size :
type : integer
default : 2
description : Number of Mongo Slaves
zone :
type : string
default : us - central1 - a
description : Zone to run
metadata : gce - zone
A valid schema file is a JSON schema file
with the addition of two top level fields, info and imports . The following
is a brief description of each field and its valid contents.
info
The info property contains meta information about the schema. This includes
information such as a title, a version number, a description and so on.
At a minimum, provide a title and description in this property.
imports
The imports field contains a list of corresponding files that are required for
templates that use this schema. When you upload a template with a schema that
has a list of imports, Deployment Manager checks that all of the files in the
imports property were uploaded along with the template.
When you specify a file in this imports field, you can omit it from your
imports field in the configuration. In the example above, the imports field
imports a file name vm-instance.jinja :
imports:
- path: vm-instance.jinja
In the corresponding configuration file, a user can omit importing the
vm-instance.jinja file, because it will be imported automatically when
Deployment Manager inspects the schema for the template.
Import paths must be relative to the location of the schema file. This lets
you store templates, schemas, and configurations in the same directory,
and ensuring that the files would have valid imports if the directory
is shared or moved.
required
The required field contains a list of elements from the properties field that
are required in the template that uses the schema. Any elements not specified in
this required field are considered optional.
properties
The properties field contains the JSON schema rules for this document. Elements
described in the properties field can be set by users of the template. You can use all
supported JSON schema validations for these properties, such as:
type (string, boolean, integer, number, ...)
default
minimum / exclusiveMinimum / maximum / exclusiveMaximum
minLength / maxLength
pattern
not X / allOf X, Y / anyOf X, Y / oneOf X, Y
At a minimum, it is good practice to include a type and description of the
field so users know what is an acceptable value for the property. For optional
properties, it is also good practice to include a default value.
Read the JSON Schema Validation documentation
for a list of validation keywords.
Note: Technically, you don't need to describe every property that can be set for
your templates in the schema. For your own reasons, you can describe some
properties and not others. It is completely up to you how much information to
include. For example, a possible use case might be to include a property in
the required field that is not described in the properties section, meaning
that the property must be set but that you decided not to describe the property
in the schema.
Set arbitrary metadata
By default, Deployment Manager ignores any fields that are not valid JSON
schema. If you need to extend your schemas to have specialized fields or
properties, you can arbitrarily create any property you want and add it to your
schema as long as the field or property does not overlap with any JSON schema
validation keywords.
For example, you can add a metadata field that annotates one of your properties:
properties :
zone :
type : string
default : us - central1 - a
description : Zone to run
metadata : a - special - property
Or you create a special variable that you might use in other applications
outside of Deployment Manager:
properties :
size :
type : integer
default : 2
description : Number of Mongo Slaves
variable - x : ultra - secret - sauce
Create a schema
A schema is a separate document that is named after the template for which it
describes. Schemas must be named with the same name as the corresponding
template, with .schema appended to the end:
TEMPLATE_NAME.EXTENSION.schema
For example, for a template named vm-instance.py , the corresponding schema
file must named vm-instance.py.schema . Only one schema can exist for each
template.
Schemas can contain one or more of the fields described in the
Structure of a schema section. Alternatively, you can
also write schemas in JSON. For examples of JSON schemas, see the
JSON schema
documentation.
Use a schema
gcloud
When you create a deployment using the Google Cloud CLI, Deployment Manager automatically
uploads all of the relevant templates for the configuration for you.
Similarly, if there are any schema files, identified by the appended
.schema format, Deployment Manager will upload the schema and validate the
deployment against the schema, before it attempts to create any resources.
To use a schema, just include it in the same local directory as your
templates and configuration, and create your deployment
as you would normally. The gcloud CLI detects and passes the schema file to
Deployment Manager.
API
Follow the instructions to create a deployment
in the API and include the schema file inline with your request body as
if you were including a template.
