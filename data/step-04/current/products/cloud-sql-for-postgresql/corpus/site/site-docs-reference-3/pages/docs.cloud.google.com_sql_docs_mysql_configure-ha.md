This page describes how to configure an instance for high availability.
You can configure an instance for high availability when you create the instance, or
you can enable high availability on an existing instance.
For more information about high availability, see Overview of the high availability configuration .
The legacy configuration for high availability used a failover replica
instance. The new configuration does not use a failover replica .
Instead, it uses Google's regional persistent disks , which synchronously replicate data at the block level between two zones in a
region. If you have an existing MySQL instance that uses the legacy high availability configuration, you
can update your configuration to use the current version.
For other procedures related to the legacy high availability configuration, see Legacy configuration for high availability .
Important: As of January 13, 2025, the
legacy configuration for high availability (HA) is deprecated for all instances.
You can't create instances with legacy high availability configuration, and you can't
enable legacy high availability configuration on any existing instances.
In addition, after January 13, 2025, legacy high availability instances
are no longer covered by the Cloud SQL SLA .
We recommend that you
update your remaining legacy high availability instances to the current high availability configuration.
You can do so by following the instructions in
Update an instance from legacy to current high availability .
Starting on May 1, 2025, Cloud SQL will begin updating any
instances that use the legacy high availability configuration to use the current regional
persistent disk-based high availability configuration automatically.
Create a new instance configured for high availability
When you create an instance and configure it for
high availability, Cloud SQL creates it as a regional instance.
To create an instance configured for high availability:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Select Create instance .
Select the database engine.
In the Choose region and zonal availability section, select Multiple zones
(Highly available) .
Expand Specify zones .
Select the primary and secondary zones. The following conditions
apply when the secondary zone is used during instance creation or edit:
The zones default to Any for the primary zone and
Any (different from primary) for the secondary zone.
If both the primary and secondary zones are specified, they must be different
zones.
Click Save .
You are returned to the instance page for the primary instance while the
instance is updated.
gcloud
Create the regional instance:
gcloud sql instances create REGIONAL_INSTANCE_NAME \
--availability-type = REGIONAL \
--database-version = DATABASE_VERSION \
--tier = MACHINE_TYPE \
--enable-bin-log
For a complete list of available parameters, see the
gcloud sql instances create
reference page.
You can specify both the primary and secondary zones, using the --zone and
--secondary-zone parameters. The following restrictions apply when the secondary
zone is used during instance creation or edit:
The zones must be valid zones.
If the secondary zone is specified, the primary must also be specified.
If the primary and secondary zones are specified, they must be different
zones.
If the primary and secondary zones are specified, they must belong to
the same region.
Configure the root user:
gcloud sql users set-password root --host = % \
--instance = PRIMARY_INSTANCE_NAME \
--password = PASSWORD
Terraform
To create an instance with high availability, use a Terraform resource .
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "mysql_instance_ha" {
name = "mysql-instance-ha"
region = "asia-northeast1"
database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
settings {
tier = "db-f1-micro"
availability_type = "REGIONAL"
backup_configuration {
enabled = true
binary_log_enabled = true
start_time = "20:55"
}
}
# set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by
# use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.
deletion_protection = false
}
Apply the changes
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module ).
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension—for example main.tf . In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete!" message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Delete the changes
To delete your changes, do the following:
To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the
deletion_protection argument to false .
deletion_protection = "false"
Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and
entering yes at the prompt:
terraform apply
Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following
command and entering yes at the prompt:
terraform destroy

Configure an existing instance for high availability
You can configure a Cloud SQL instance for high availability by using the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI , or the API.
Note: After you start the high availability configuration for an
instance, you can't stop it. Reconfiguring the instance restarts it. It typically takes only a few minutes for Cloud SQL to reconfigure the instance and restart it. However, if the instance has a large disk or load, then it might take up to an hour.
Console
Important: You can't use the Google Cloud console to configure instances that have Private Service Connect enabled for high availability. To configure these instances, use gcloud CLI or the API.
To configure an instance for high availability:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Click Edit .
In the Choose region and zonal availability section, select Multiple zones
(Highly available) .
Expand Specify zones .
Select the primary and secondary zones. The following
conditions apply when you use the secondary zone while you're creating or
editing an instance:
The zones default to Any for the primary zone and
Any (different from primary) for the secondary zone.
If you specify both the primary and secondary zones, then they must be
different zones.
Click Save .
gcloud
To configure an instance to be a regional, high availability instance, use the gcloud sql instances patch command:
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME \
--availability-type REGIONAL \
--enable-bin-log \

Initiate failover
Testing failover is optional, but is recommended so that you can see how your
application responds in the event of a failover.
This feature helps you test your application's response to an automatic
failover. Make sure that your instance has completed any previous failover
(so it's responding to connection requests) before you trigger another
failover. Also, before you initiate failover for your instance,
configure the instance for high availability .
To learn more about failovers, see the Failover overview .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Click Failover .
In the Manually trigger a failover dialog box, enter the ID of
your instance in the text field, and then click Trigger Failover .

Change the zones of a high availability instance
Changing one or both zones of an existing high availability instance causes a
few minutes of downtime while the instance is reconfigured. To see the current
primary and secondary zones that the high availability instance is running in,
see Verify an
instance's high availability configuration .
Note: Once you start the zone change operation on an
instance, you cannot stop it. This operation restarts the instance. It
typically takes only a few minutes for the configuration and restart to
complete. But if the instance has a large disk or load, it might take up to
an hour.
To change the zones of a high availability instance:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Click Edit .
In the Choose region and zonal availability section, expand
Specify zones and select new zones. The zones default to
Any for the primary zone and Any (different from
primary) for the secondary zone. The following restrictions apply:
You can specify the primary zone only, or both the primary and secondary
zones.
If both the primary and secondary zones are specified, they must be
different zones.
Click Save .
You are returned to the instance page for the primary instance while the
instance is updated.
