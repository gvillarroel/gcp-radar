This page describes self-service maintenance, which lets you accept a
maintenance update on your instance outside of the normal flow of scheduled
maintenance.
Overview
Cloud SQL regularly releases software improvements, such as
patches for known vulnerabilities, through new maintenance versions.
While Cloud SQL schedules maintenance updates once every few
months to ensure you have the latest maintenance version, you might want to use
self-service maintenance if:
You need an update sooner than your next scheduled maintenance event.
You want to catch up to the latest maintenance version after skipping your most
recent scheduled maintenance event.
You're not required to manually update to the latest version. You can
let Cloud SQL automatically update your maintenance version during your
next scheduled maintenance event.
Manage maintenance on all read replicas of a primary instance
When you perform self-service maintenance on a primary instance that has
read replicas ,
Cloud SQL automatically applies the maintenance update to all
its read replicas. If you have more than three read replica instances,
then the instances are divided into groups and updated in parallel.
As the final step, the maintenance update is applied to the primary instance.
If necessary, you can still perform self-service maintenance on a single
read replica. However, to ensure that all read replica instances and
the primary instance operate on the same maintenance version,
we recommend that you perform self-service maintenance on all the read replicas
of a primary instance at the same time.
To update a single read replica instance,
specify that read replica instance when you perform self-service
maintenance.
Automatic server certificate rotation
For instances that use shared CAs ( serverCaMode is set to
GOOGLE_MANAGED_CAS_CA ), the expiration period of the server certificates is 1
year. When you perform self-service maintenance on an instance, you can let
Cloud SQL automatically rotate your server certificate during
maintenance updates up to 180 days before the certificate expires by enabling
automatic server certificate rotation .
Before you begin
Before you perform self-service maintenance, first check the current
maintenance version. Then you can
determine the target
maintenance version that you want to update to and
update the instance to that version.
If you use read replicas, then
update all the read replicas of the primary instance
to that version.
To see the current maintenance version of an instance, use the following procedure:
gcloud
Before you run the following gcloud command, make the following
replacement:
INSTANCE_ID : The instance to query
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_ID
The maintenance version that is installed on the instance is indicated
next to the maintenanceVersion attribute.
REST v1
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance that you're configuring for high availability
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to

Update all read replicas of a primary instance to the target maintenance version
To perform a maintenance update on all read replica instances of a primary instance,
use the following procedure.
Note: After you update an instance to the latest maintenance version, you can't
revert to an earlier version.
gcloud
Before using the following gcloud command, make the following
replacement:
PRIMARY_INSTANCE_ID : The ID of the primary instance
MAINTENANCE_VERSION : The Cloud SQL maintenance version to apply
gcloud sql instances patch PRIMARY_INSTANCE_ID \
--maintenance-version = MAINTENANCE_VERSION
At the prompt for confirmation, type Y to continue, or
type N to cancel.
If you select Y , then the update process applies the
specified maintenance version to all read replicas first before updating
the primary instance. Any read replica instances that have already been
updated to the target maintenance version are skipped.
If you select N , then no instances are updated.
After the update of the read replicas and the primary instance completes,
a message similar to the following appears:
Patching Cloud SQL instance....done.
Patching Cloud SQL instance....done.
Patching Cloud SQL instance....done.
Updated [https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /instances/ PRIMARY_INSTANCE_ID ]
Terraform
To create an instance, use a Terraform resource .
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "mysql_ssm_instance_name" {
name = "mysql-ssm-instance-name"
region = "asia-northeast1"
database_version = "MYSQL_5_7"
maintenance_version = "MYSQL_5_7_38.R20220809.02_00"
settings {
tier = "db-f1-micro"
}
# set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by
# use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.
deletion_protection = false
}
Apply the changes
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module ).
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension—for example main.tf . In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete!" message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Delete the changes
To delete your changes, do the following:
To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the
deletion_protection argument to false .
deletion_protection = "false"
Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and
entering yes at the prompt:
terraform apply
Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following
command and entering yes at the prompt:
terraform destroy
