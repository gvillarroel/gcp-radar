| SQL Server
Warning: All data on an instance, including backups, is permanently
lost when that instance is deleted. To preserve your data, you can either
take a final backup
of your instance at time of deletion, enable
retained backups
for your instance before you delete it, or
export your data to Cloud Storage
before you delete it.
This page describes how to manage backups for your instance that uses
the standard backups
option. This includes how to schedule and turn off automatic backups, create
and manage on-demand backups, and view backups for your Cloud SQL
instance. If your instance is using enhanced backups, see
Manage enhanced backups .
For more information about how backups work, see
Cloud SQL backups overview .
For more information about the backup options available for your
Cloud SQL instances, see
Choose your backup option .
Note: If your instance was created before the
enhanced backups launch ,
then your instance is using the standard backups option. To upgrade your
instance to the enhanced backups option, see
Enable enhanced backups .
Create an on-demand backup
To create an on-demand backup:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Select Backups from the SQL navigation menu.
Click Create backup .
On the Create backup page, add a description, if needed, and
click Create .
gcloud
Create the backup:
gcloud sql backups create \
--async \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME
You can provide a description of the backup using the --description
parameter.
To create a backup in a custom location:
gcloud sql backups create \
--async \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--location = BACKUP_LOCATION

Configure automated backups
Automated backups are taken on a schedule cadence while your instance is
running. You can also set the retention period for your automated backups.
For more information about how automated backups work, see
Automated backups .
Schedule automated backups
To schedule automated backups for an instance:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Select Backups from the SQL navigation menu.
Click Edit , next to Settings .
Choose a window of time for your data to be automatically backed up.
Click Save .
gcloud
Edit the instance to specify a backup start time:
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --backup-start-time = HH:MM
The backup-start-time parameter is specified in a 24-hour time
format, in the UTC±00 time zone, and specifies the start of a
4-hour backup window. Backups can start any time during the backup window.
Confirm your changes:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
In the backupConfiguration section, confirm that you see
enabled: true and the time that you specified.
Terraform
To create a backup for a database, use a Terraform resource .
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "instance" {
name = "postgres-instance-backup"
region = "us-central1"
database_version = "POSTGRES_14"
settings {
tier = "db-custom-2-7680"
backup_configuration {
enabled = true
start_time = "20:55"
}
}
# set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by
# use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.
deletion_protection = false
}
Apply the changes
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module ).
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension—for example main.tf . In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete!" message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Delete the changes
To delete your changes, do the following:
To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the
deletion_protection argument to false .
deletion_protection = "false"
Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and
entering yes at the prompt:
terraform apply
Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following
command and entering yes at the prompt:
terraform destroy

Delete a backup
You can delete automated and on-demand backups.
Deleting a backup might not
free up as much space as the size of the backup. This is because backups are
incremental, so deleting an older backup might transfer some of its contents
to a more recent backup to preserve the integrity of the newer backup.

Set a custom location for backups
Only use a custom backup location if required by regulation. If not
required, use the default multi-region backup location.
You can use a custom location for on-demand and automatic backups. For a
complete list of valid location values, see the
Instance locations .
Note: If you change the location where backups are stored, existing
backups remain in their original location.
Note: Backups fail if they are in a region
the organization policy does not allow. Backups taken in the same region as the
instance always succeed, regardless of the organization policy or other
constraints.

View a list of backups during an outage
When an instance is in a region that is having an outage, you can only view
backups for that instance using a wildcard ( - ) with the backupRuns.list API.
The wildcard returns all backups in the project. See
Restoring to a different instance .
When there's an outage in a region where an instance has customer-managed
encryption keys (CMEK) enabled, you can't restore the backups for that instance
to a different region. The reason is because Cloud SQL uses regional Cloud KMS keys
for encryption when CMEK is enabled on the instance. To restore backups for a
CMEK instance, Cloud SQL must have access to the CMEK key. In a regional
outage, there's no access to the Cloud KMS keys in that region.
gcloud
List the backups for every instance in a project:
gcloud sql backups list --instance -
