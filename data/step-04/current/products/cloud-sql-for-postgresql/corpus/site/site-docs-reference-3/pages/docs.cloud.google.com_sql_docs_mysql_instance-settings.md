Settings for Cloud SQL for MySQL
Setting
Modifiable after creation?
Possible values
Instance ID
N
Composed of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens; must start with
a letter. The total length must be 98 characters or less.
Region
N
The instance's region. For a list of all
available regions by Cloud SQL edition, see
Region availability .
Zone
Y
The possible values depend on the region.
Database version
N
For Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition, MySQL 8.0.31 and later:
Console string API enum string
MySQL 8.4 (default) MYSQL_8_4
MySQL 8.0 MYSQL_8_0
For Cloud SQL Enterprise edition:
Console string API enum string
MySQL 8.4 (default) MYSQL_8_4
MySQL 8.0 MYSQL_8_0
MySQL 5.7 MYSQL_5_7
MySQL 5.6 MYSQL_5_6
Automatic minor version upgrade
Y
Upgrades MySQL 8.0 instances automatically to the default minor version
during scheduled maintenance updates.
Available only for MySQL 8.0.35 and later.
SSL mode
Y
Enforces/enables SSL as follows:
ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED : allows non-SSL/non-TLS
and SSL/TLS connections.
For SSL connections, the client certificate isn't verified.
This is the default value.
ENCRYPTED_ONLY : only allows connections encrypted with
SSL/TLS.
TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED : only allows connections
encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid client certificates.
When you use these
values, you must set requireSsl to a compatible value or unset
to avoid the conflict between values of two settings. For more information,
see IpConfiguration .
Server CA mode
Y
Lets you configure the server certificate authority (CA) for an instance.
You can select one of the following available server CA options:
GOOGLE_MANAGED_INTERNAL_CA : this is the default value for instances
created with the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI , the Cloud SQL Admin API, and Terraform.
With this option, an internal CA dedicated to each Cloud SQL
instance signs the server certificate for that instance.
GOOGLE_MANAGED_CAS_CA : with this option, a CA hierarchy
consisting of a root CA and subordinate
server CAs managed by Cloud SQL and hosted on
Google Cloud Certificate Authority Service (CA Service) is used.
The subordinate server CAs in a region sign the server certificates and
are shared across instances in the region. For Cloud SQL Auth Proxy connections,
to connect to an instance configured with the shared CA option, use the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy version 2.13.0 or later.
CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CAS_CA : with this option, you manage the
CA hierarchy and the rotation of CA certificates. Before you can create an instance with this option,
using CA Service, you create a CA pool in the same region
as your instance and at least one CA in that pool. When you create your
instance, you specify the CA pool. Your request is delegated to a
project-specific service account, which has the permission to use the
CA pool. The service account requests a CA from the pool and Cloud SQL
uses that CA to sign the server certificate for the instance.
For Cloud SQL Auth Proxy connections,
to connect to an instance configured with the customer-managed CA option,
use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy version 2.14.3 or later.
For more information, see Certificate authority (CA) hierarchies .

See
Configuring Database Flags .
Instance ID
The instance ID is the name of the instance. It is used to uniquely identify your
instance within the project. Choose an instance name that is
aligned with the purpose of the instance when possible.
The total length of project-ID:instance-ID must be 98
characters or less.
You do not need to include the project ID in the instance name. This is done automatically where
appropriate (for example, in the log files).
Important:
You should be aware that some resource identifiers (such as project IDs) might be
retained beyond the life of your project. For this reason, avoid storing
sensitive information in resource identifiers.
...see naming guidelines
Region
The Google Cloud region where your instance is located.
You can only set
the region during instance creation. To improve performance, keep your data
close to the services that need it. For more information, see
Instance Locations .
Zone
The Google Cloud zone where your instance is located. If you are
connecting from a Compute Engine instance, select the zone where the
Compute Engine instance is located. Otherwise, accept the default zone.
You can edit the instance later to change the zone, if needed. For more
information, see
Instance Locations .
Machine Type
Determines memory and virtual cores available for your Cloud SQL
instance. Machine types are part of a machine series, and machine series
availability is determined by your Cloud SQL edition.
For Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition instances, Cloud SQL
offers predefined machine types for your instances in
the N2 and C4A
machine series.
For Cloud SQL Enterprise edition instances, Cloud SQL offers the
general purpose shared core , general purpose dedicated core ,
and the N4 machine series.
If you require real-time processing, such as online transaction
processing (OLTP), make sure that your instance has enough memory to contain
the entire working set. However, there are other factors that can impact
memory requirements, such as number of active connections, and internal
overhead processes. Perform load testing to avoid performance
issues in your production environment.
When you configure your instance, select sufficient memory and vCPUs to handle
your needs, and scale up your instance as your requirements increase. A machine configuration
with insufficient vCPUs might lose its SLA coverage. For more information,
see Operational guidelines .
To learn more about the machine types and machine series available
for your Cloud SQL instance, see
Machine series overview .
Note: The db-f1-micro and
db-g1-small machine types aren't included in the
Cloud SQL SLA. These machine types are configured to use a shared-core CPU, and are
designed to provide low-cost test and development instances only.
Don't use them for production instances.
Your machine type affects the cost of your instance. For more information,
see Instance Pricing .
You can also see pricing for various scenarios
with the Pricing Calculator .
Database version
Unless you need a capability provided only by a specific version,
accept the default database version (MySQL 8.4). For gcloud command and
REST API usage, see
the reference documentation .
Automatic minor version upgrade
Available only for instances running Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.0.35 or later.
You can configure your instance to receive minor version upgrades
automatically during its regularly scheduled maintenance events.
This setting is enabled by default for MySQL 8.0 instances that you create
without specifying a minor version.
For more information, see
Automatic upgrade .
Storage type
Storage type is determined by the machine type you select
for your instance. Each machine type belongs to a specific machine series, and
each machine series offers different storage type options.
Storage type by Cloud SQL editions and machine series:
Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition C4A machine series : Hyperdisk Balanced
Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition N2 machine series : SSD
Cloud SQL Enterprise edition N4 machine series : Hyperdisk Balanced
Cloud SQL Enterprise edition general purpose shared or dedicated core : SSD or HDD
For N2 machine series, choosing SSD , the default
value, provides your instance with SSD storage. SSDs provide lower latency
and higher data throughput. If you don't need high-performance access to your
data, for example for long-term storage or rarely accessed data, you can reduce
your costs by choosing HDD .
For the C4A and N4 machine series, choosing Hyperdisk Balanced , the default
and only value, provides a scalable, high-performance storage service.
To learn more about Hyperdisk Balanced and its limitations, see
Storage options overview .
Set password policy
The password policy for the instance. It includes the following options:
Minimum length : Specifies the minimum number of characters that
the password must have.
Password complexity : Checks if the password is a
combination of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and non-alphanumeric
characters.
Restrict password reuse : Specifies the number of previous
passwords that you cannot reuse. Supported only on Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.0 and later.
Disallow username : Prevents the use of the username in the password.
Cores
The number of CPUs for your instance. You can also choose to create an
instance with less than one CPU (a shared code instance, or shared vCPU).
Memory
The amount of memory available for your instance. For
performance-sensitive workloads such as online transaction processing
(OLTP), make sure that your instance has
enough memory to contain the entire working set. However, there are other
factors that can impact memory requirements, such as number of active
connections. Perform load testing to avoid performance issues
in production.
SSL mode
(Optional) The SSL/TLS options for a database connection.
Cloud SQL uses SSL/TLS to establish secure, authenticated, and encrypted
connections to instances. You can use the SSL mode setting
sslMode to enforce all
database connections to an instance to use SSL/TLS encryption.
You can also use this setting to enforce verification of client
certificates. This setting gives you more granular
controls over your SSL connections compared to
requireSsl . We recommend that you use sslMode .
For more information,
see IpConfiguration .
You can enforce SSL when you create an instance or update it for any
existing instance.
Server CA mode
(Optional) When you create an instance, you can select the server
CA mode for the instance.
GOOGLE_MANAGED_INTERNAL_CA : this is the default value.
Cloud SQL creates a new self-signed server CA for each
instance.
GOOGLE_MANAGED_CAS_CA : the instance uses a server CA
hierarchy hosted by Certificate Authority Service and the issuing CAs are shared across all
instances in the same region.
Supported only on MySQL 8.0.30 and later.
CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CAS_CA : the instance uses a server CA
that you create from a CA pool. With this option, you manage the
CA hierarchy and the rotation of CA certificates.
Supported only on MySQL 8.0.30 and later.
For more information about these options, see Certificate authority (CA) hierarchies .
Storage capacity
Choose a capacity to fit your database size. After you have created your
instance, you can manually increase the storage capacity by
editing your instance
configuration , but you cannot decrease it. Increasing the storage
capacity does not cause downtime.
The amount of storage capacity allocated for your instance affects the
cost of your instance. For more information, see Storage and
Networking Pricing .
For read replicas, the storage capacity must always be at least as high
as the storage capacity of the primary instance. When a primary instance
is resized, all read replicas are resized, if needed, so that they have at
least as much storage capacity as the updated primary instance.
Note: Setting your storage capacity too small
without enabling
automatic storage increases
can cause your instance to lose its SLA.
Learn more
Cloud SQL may override the enable automatic storage increases
and automatic storage increase limit settings to perform
critical database maintenance.
Enable automatic storage increases
If you enable this setting, Cloud SQL checks your available storage
every 30 seconds. If the available storage falls below a threshold size,
Cloud SQL automatically adds additional storage capacity.
If the available storage repeatedly falls below the threshold size, Cloud
SQL continues to add storage until it reaches the maximum of 64 TB.
Note: You can increase storage size,
but you cannot decrease it; the storage increases are permanent for the life
of the instance. When you enable this setting, a spike in storage
requirements can permanently increase storage costs (incrementally)
for your instance.
If an instance runs out of available space, it can cause the instance to go
offline, and the
Cloud SQL SLA might not cover the outage.
Learn more .
The automatic storage increase setting of a primary instance automatically
applies to any read replicas of that instance. The automatic storage
increase setting cannot be independently set for read replicas.
Note: When an instance is nearly out of
storage capacity, it's automatically stopped to prevent the loss of information.
Enabling this setting might prevent such an operation.
Threshold
The threshold size depends on the amount of storage
currently provisioned for your instance:
Hyperdisk Balanced
MAX(5, (provisioned storage) * 5 / 100)
The threshold size is rounded up to the nearest whole number.
For example, the threshold calculation for a 66 GB instance using
Hyperdisk balanced is:
MAX(5, (66 * 0.05)) = MAX(5, 3.3) = 5 GB
SSD or HDD
MIN(5 + (provisioned storage)/25, 25)
The threshold size is rounded down to the nearest whole number.
For example, the threshold calculation for a 66 GB instance using
SSD or HDD is:
MIN(5 + (66/25), 25) = MIN(5 + 2.6, 25) = MIN(7, 25) = 7 GB
Amount of storage added
For Hyperdisk Balanced, the amount of storage added is 15% of the current
provisioned storage, but can't be smaller than 5 GB. This can be calculated
using the following:
MAX(5, (provisioned storage) * 15 / 100)
The threshold size is rounded down to the nearest whole number.
For all other storage types, including SSD and HDD, the amount of storage
added to the instance is equal to the threshold size,
which cannot be larger than 25 GB.
Considerations for large disks
For Hyperdisk Balanced, instances provisioned with storage of more than
100 GB have a minimum possible empty space of 5% of the provisioned capacity.
For all other storage types and instances provisioned with storage of 500 GB
or more, the threshold size
is always 25 GB and the amount of storage added is always 25 GB. As a result,
the maximum possible empty space is 50 GB. If you don't manually resize the
instance with disk space that's greater than 5 TB, then the disk can remain at
99% capacity even though the instance has empty space.
Before an operation that rapidly grows disk space usage,
such as a large import or a query that requires a large temp table,
manually resize the disk, rather than
depend on automatic storage increase to keep up. For Hyperdisk Balanced,
storage increases that happen too frequently in a short timespan (4 hours),
these increases might be subject to throttling. This might result in an
instance running out of available space even though automatic storage
increases are enabled and the storage size is below the
automatic
storage increase limit .
The file system uses some space internally for file system metadata.
This space isn't included in the disk usage metric
( database/disk/bytes_used ).
For large disks, the reserved space can take 1% to 3% of total disk size,
so you might see the
automatic storage increase occur before the disk usage reaches the threshold.
Data encryption method
By default, your Cloud SQL instance is encrypted with a
Google-owned and managed key. If you want to control this key, then
use a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) in Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).
Cloud KMS integrates with Cloud SQL.
Using Cloud KMS keys gives you control over their protection level,
location, rotation schedule, usage and access permissions. In addition, you can
use various encryption keys across resources. Using Cloud KMS also
lets you track key usage, view audit logs, and control key life cycles.
Instead of Google owning and managing the keys that protect your data, you
control and manage these keys in Cloud KMS.
For more information about CMEKs, see
About customer-managed encryption keys (CMEKs) .
Automatic storage increase limit
If you enable the
automatic storage increase setting , you can provide a specific limit on
how large the storage for your instance can automatically grow. Keep in mind
that the bigger the size of the instance, the greater the operational latency.
You can't decrease storage size, so this limit can prevent your
instance size from growing too large (due to a temporary increase
in traffic). Keep in mind that when an instance becomes unable to
add storage that it needs, the instance likely stops accepting incoming
connections and could go offline.
Setting this limit to zero, the default value, means that there is no
limit (other than the maximum available storage for the instance tier).
To set the limit when you create the instance, use the
--storage-auto-increase-limit= INTEGER_VALUE_OF_GB
parameter, as described on the create instance
page. To set the limit on an existing instance, use the same parameter with the
gcloud beta sql instances patch command.
The automatic storage increase limit setting of a primary instance
automatically applies to any read replicas of that instance. The automatic
storage increase limit setting cannot be independently set for read
replicas.
Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
These options determine if automated backups are performed and
if binary logging is enabled.
Both options add a small performance cost and use additional storage, but
are required for the creation of replicas and clones, and for point-in-time
recovery. When you select this option, you can also select a timeframe when
automated backups occur.
Automated backups happen daily, during the time
window you choose. At the end of seven days, the oldest backup is deleted.
For information about point-in-time recovery,
see
Overview of point-in-time recovery .
For information about
replication, see
Replication Options .
For information about cloning instances, see
Cloning Instances .
Note: Enabling or disabling
point-in-time recovery causes the instance to be restarted. Existing
database connections are closed and must be reopened.
To speed up instance creation when PITR is enabled, Cloud SQL uses an initial
instant snapshot for PITR instead of a
standard backup .
This snapshot is later converted to a standard backup in the background to support restore
operations.
Retention settings for automated backups
The default value for the number of retained backups is 7 but you can
change it to any value in the range of 1 to 365.
See
Automated backup and transaction log retention for more information.
Location options
You can choose to store backups in multiple or single regions.
Multi-region is the default, and the recommended choice because
it provides protection against downtime when a region becomes unavailable.
Backups are stored in regions that are closest to the instance.
You also have the option of selecting a custom location for your backup.
Only use this option if required by regulation or if an organization
policy requires your backups to be in specific multiple or single
regions. See
Custom locations
for more information.
Instance deletion protection
Protects an instance against accidental deletion. If this setting is
enabled, you must deactivate it before deleting the instance. See
Prevent deletion of an instance .
Retain backups after instance deletion
Retains on-demand and automated backups for an instance after the
instance is deleted. For more information about this setting, see
Retained backups .
Take a final backup at instance deletion
Takes a final backup of an instance at time of instance deletion. Use final-backup-retention-days to set the retention period for the final backup. If no retention
period is set, then the retention period is set to
default, which is 30 days.
For more information about this setting, see
Take a final backup before instance deletion .
Set the retention period for the final backup
Sets the retention period for the final backup. The retention period can
be set to a maximum of 365 days. If the
final-backup-retention-days value isn't set when you enable
final-backup , then the default retention period of 30 days is
used. For more information about this setting, see
Take a final backup before instance deletion .
Enable point-in-time recovery
Point-in-time recovery lets you recover from a backup, starting from a
specific point in time.
For information about point-in-time recovery, see
Overview
of point-in-time recovery .
Availability: Zonal
Puts your instance and backups in a single zone. When you select this
option, there is no failover in the event of an outage. Recommended only for
test and development purposes.
High availability (regional)
When you select High availability (regional) , if there is an outage, your instance
fails over to another zone in the region where your instance is located, as
long as the failover zone is not having an outage. It is recommended that
you select High availability (regional) for instances in your
production environment.
See the Overview of the
high availability configuration .
Maintenance window
The day and hour that your maintenance events for the Cloud SQL instance
are scheduled. For Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition primary instances, the maintenance downtime is typically less
than 1 second. For all other instances, maintenance
downtime is typically 60 seconds or less on average.
Read replicas do not support maintenance window settings at this time.
For more information about maintenance, see
About maintenance on Cloud SQL instances .
Maintenance timing
Your preference about the relative timing of maintenance updates.
You can receive your updates one or two weeks after the notification and
test your maintenance updates in a test environment before your production
instances get the update. You can also choose to receive the maintenance
update five weeks (" week5 ") after the notification is sent out.
The maintenance timing setting doesn't affect the maintenance version that
Cloud SQL applies to your instance.
If you don't set the maintenance timing setting, Cloud SQL chooses
the timing of updates to your instance (within its maintenance window, if
applicable).
For more information about maintenance, see
About maintenance on Cloud SQL instances .
Private IP
Configures your instance to use private IP.
Learn more .
Public IP
If enabled, your instance is allocated a public IPv4 address.
When you deactivate Public IP, that address is released; you can reenable
Public IP later, but you receive a different IPv4 address.
By default, the public IP address is blocked for all addresses. Use
Authorized networks to
enable access.
Data Api Access
Controls whether to allow connections to the instance using the Data API.
If activated, you can use
executeSql
to execute statements on the instance. This setting is deactivated by default.
Authorized networks
You can add specific IP addresses or ranges of addresses to
open your instance to those addresses.
For information about configuring IP addresses, see
Configuring IP connectivity .
Private path for Google Cloud services
This configuration setting lets other Google Cloud
services, such as BigQuery, access data in Cloud SQL
and make queries against this data over a private connection.
The configuration is available only when you configure your instance
to use a private IP address, and you configure an
authorized network to create a private connection.
In the Google Cloud console, configure a private path by selecting the
Enable private path checkbox. For the gcloud CLI , use the
--enable-google-private-path flag when you create the instance.
Data API access
This setting controls connectivity to the instance using
Data API .
It's disallowed by default. When allowed, authorized users can use
Data API to connect to the instance.
For instances with Private IP only, it allows authorized users to connect
from the public internet.
In the Google Cloud console, configure Data API access by selecting the
Allow Data API checkbox. For the gcloud CLI , use the
--data-api-access=ALLOW_DATA_API flag when you create the instance.
Data cache
Data cache is enabled automatically for Cloud SQL for MySQL Enterprise Plus edition instances. Data cache utilizes local SSDs to extend a buffer pool from memory to the SSD tier. Cloud SQL manages this setting. Caching your entire working set
provides maximum performance when using data cache.
You can use the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI , or Cloud SQL Admin API to turn this setting on or off for your Cloud SQL for MySQL Enterprise Plus edition instances.
Activation policy
The activation policy is used only to
start or stop the instance. You change the activation policy by
starting and stopping the instance .
Stopping the instance prevents further instance charges.
Database flags
You can set specific database flags on the Cloud SQL instance.
For a complete list of the database flags you can set, see
Configure Database Flags .
Impact of changing instance settings
For most instance settings, Cloud SQL applies the change immediately and
connectivity to the instance is unaffected.
For MySQL instances, changing either the machine type or the zone of the
instance results in the instance going offline for several minutes. Plan to make
these kinds of changes when your application can handle an outage of this
length.
If you're using Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition, then you can make some instance setting changes,
such as scale up vCPUs or enable or disable data cache, with near-zero downtime.
For more information, see Availability in Cloud SQL .
