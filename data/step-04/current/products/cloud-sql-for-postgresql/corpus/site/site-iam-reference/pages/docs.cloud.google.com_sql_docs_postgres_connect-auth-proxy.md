This page describes how to connect to your Cloud SQL instance using the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
For more information about how the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy works, see
About the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy .
Overview
Using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is the
recommended method for connecting to a Cloud SQL instance. The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy:
Works with both public and private IP endpoints
Validates connections using credentials for a user or service account
Wraps the connection in a SSL/TLS layer that's authorized for a Cloud SQL
instance
Some Google Cloud services and applications use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to provide
connections for public IP paths with encryption and authorization, including:
App Engine standard environment
App Engine flexible environment
Cloud Run
Applications running in
Google Kubernetes Engine can connect using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy .
Note: For connecting from Google Kubernetes Engine, we recommend running the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a sidecar pattern, as an
additional container that shares a pod with your application. Also see the
related
quickstart .
See the Quickstart for using
the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy for a basic introduction to its usage.
You can also connect, with or without the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, using a psql
client from a local machine or
Compute Engine .
Before you begin
Before you can connect to a Cloud SQL instance, do the following:
For a user or service account, make sure the account has the
Cloud SQL Client role. This role contains the
cloudsql.instances.connect permission,
which authorizes a principal to connect to all Cloud SQL instances
in a project.
Go to the IAM page
You can optionally include an
IAM condition
in the IAM policy binding that grants the account permission
to connect only to one specific Cloud SQL instance.
Enable the Cloud SQL Admin API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Install and initialize the gcloud CLI .
Optional. Install the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker client .

Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker image
The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy has different container images, such as distroless , alpine ,
and buster . The default Cloud SQL Auth Proxy container image uses
distroless , which
contains no shell. If you need a shell or related tools, then download an image based on
alpine or buster .
For more information, see
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Container Images .
You can pull the latest image to your local machine using Docker by using the following command:
docker pull gcr.io/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy:2.21.1
Note : The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy uses a repository that supports the
gcr.io domain but serves images from Artifact Registry.
For more information, see
Transition from Container Registry .
Other OS
For other operating systems not included here, you can compile the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy from source .
Start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
Depending on your language and environment, you can start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy using TCP sockets,
Unix sockets, or the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker image. The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy binary connects to one or more Cloud SQL
instances specified on the command line, and opens a local connection as either TCP or a Unix
socket. Other applications and services, such as your application code or
database management client tools, can connect to Cloud SQL instances
through those TCP or Unix socket connections.
Warning: Be careful when binding the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to an external interface.
Anyone with access to that interface/port will be authorized to connect to your instance.
TCP sockets
For TCP connections, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy listens on localhost ( 127.0.0.1 ) by default.
So, when you specify --port PORT_NUMBER for an instance, the local connection
is at 127.0.0.1:PORT_NUMBER .
Alternatively, you can specify a different address for the local connection.
For example, here's how to make the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy listen at 0.0.0.0:1234 for the
local connection:
./cloud-sql-proxy --address 0 .0.0.0 --port 1234 INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME
Copy your INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME . This can be found
on the Overview page for your instance in the
Google Cloud console or by running the
following command:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME --format = 'value(connectionName)'
For example: myproject:myregion:myinstance .
If the instance has both public and private IP configured, and you want the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to use the private IP address,
you must provide the following option when you start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy:
--private-ip
If you are using a service account to authenticate the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy,
note the location on your client machine of the private key file that was created when you created
the service account.
Start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
Some possible Cloud SQL Auth Proxy invocation strings:
Using Cloud SDK authentication:
./cloud-sql-proxy --port 5432 INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME
The specified port must not already be in use, for example, by a local database server.
Using a service account and explicitly including the name of the instance connection
(recommended for production environments):
./cloud-sql-proxy \
--credentials-file PATH_TO_KEY_FILE INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME &
For more information about Cloud SQL Auth Proxy options, see
Options for authenticating the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy .
Unix sockets
Note:
The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy currently does not support Unix sockets on Windows, so
this option is only available for Linux and macOS platforms.
The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy can listen on a Unix socket, which is a Posix standard
mechanism for using a folder to manage communication between two processes
running on the same host. Advantages to using Unix sockets are improved security
and lower latency, however, you cannot access a Unix socket from an
external machine.
Note: The PostgreSQL standard requires a `.s.PGSQL.5432` suffix in the socket path. Some
libraries apply this suffix automatically, but others require you to specify the socket path as
follows:
/cloudsql/ INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME /.s.PGSQL.5432
To create and use a Unix socket, the target directory must exist
and both the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy and application must have read and write access to it.
Copy your INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME . This can be found
on the Overview page for your instance in the
Google Cloud console or by running the
following command:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME --format = 'value(connectionName)'
For example: myproject:myregion:myinstance .
Create the directory where the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy sockets will live:
sudo mkdir /cloudsql ; sudo chmod 777 /cloudsql
If you are using a service account to authenticate the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy,
note the location on your client machine of the private key file that was created when you created
the service account.
Open a new Cloud Shell terminal window and start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
Some possible Cloud SQL Auth Proxy invocation strings:
Using Google Cloud SDK authentication:
./cloud-sql-proxy --unix-socket /cloudsql INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME &
Using a service account:
./cloud-sql-proxy --unix-socket /cloudsql
--credentials-file PATH_TO_KEY_FILE INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME &
Start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in its own Cloud Shell terminal so you can monitor its output
without it mixing with the output from other programs.
For more information about Cloud SQL Auth Proxy options, see
Options for authenticating the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy .
NOTE:
When using a unix socket to connect to Cloud SQL using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, make sure the socket
filename's length does not surpass the system's limit. It depends on the system, but it's usually
between 91-108 characters. On Linux, the length is usually defined as 108, and you can use the
following command to check:
cat /usr/include/linux/un.h | grep "define UNIX_PATH_MAX"
Docker
To run the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a Docker container, use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker
image available from the Google Container Registry .
You can start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy using either TCP sockets or Unix sockets, with the
commands shown below. The options use an INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME as
the connection string to identify a Cloud SQL instance. You can find the
INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME on the Overview page for your
instance in the Google Cloud console . or by running the
following command:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME .
For example: myproject:myregion:myinstance .
Note: The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy doesn't support listening on Unix domain sockets on Windows.
Depending on your language and environment, you can start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
using either TCP sockets or Unix sockets. Unix sockets are not supported
for applications written in the Java programming language or for the Windows
environment.
Using TCP sockets
docker run -d \\
-v PATH_TO_KEY_FILE :/path/to/service-account-key.json \\
-p 127 .0.0.1:5432:5432 \\
gcr.io/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy:2.21.1 \\
--address 0 .0.0.0 --port 5432 \\
--credentials-file /path/to/service-account-key.json INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME
If you're using the credentials provided by your Compute Engine instance,
don't include the --credentials-file parameter and the
-v PATH_TO_KEY_FILE :/path/to/service-account-key.json
line.
Always specify 127.0.0.1 prefix in -p so that the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is not
exposed outside the local host. The "0.0.0.0" in the instances parameter
is required to make the port accessible from outside of the Docker
container.
Using Unix sockets
docker run -d -v /cloudsql:/cloudsql \\
-v PATH_TO_KEY_FILE :/path/to/service-account-key.json \\
gcr.io/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy:2.21.1 --unix-socket = /cloudsql \\
--credentials-file /path/to/service-account-key.json INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME
If you're using the credentials provided by your Compute Engine instance,
don't include the --credentials-file parameter and the
-v PATH_TO_KEY_FILE :/path/to/service-account-key.json
line.
If you are using a container optimized image, use a writeable directory
in place of /cloudsql , for example:
-v /mnt/stateful_partition/cloudsql:/cloudsql
You can specify more than one instance, separated by commas.
You can also use
Compute Engine metadata to
dynamically determine the instances to connect to.

Connect with the psql client
Debian/Ubuntu
Install the psql client from the package manager:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
CentOS/RHEL
Install the psql client from the package manager:
sudo yum install postgresql
openSUSE
Install the psql client from the package manager:
sudo zypper install postgresql
Other platforms
Download the PostgreSQL Core Distribution for your platform from the
PostgreSQL Downloads page .
The Core Distribution includes the psql client.
Install the PostgreSQL database, following the directions on the download page.
The connection string you use depends on whether you started the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy using a TCP socket or
a UNIX socket or Docker.
TCP sockets
Start the psql client:
psql "host=127.0.0.1 sslmode=disable dbname= DB_NAME user= USERNAME "
Even though the sslmode parameter is set to disable , the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy does
provide an encrypted connection.
When you connect using TCP sockets, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is accessed through 127.0.0.1 .
If prompted, enter the password.
The psql prompt appears.
Using Unix sockets
Start the psql client:
psql "sslmode=disable host=/cloudsql/ INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME dbname= DB_NAME user= USERNAME "
Even though the sslmode parameter is set to disable , the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy does
provide an encrypted connection.
Enter the password.
The psql prompt appears.

Additional topics
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy command-line arguments
The examples above cover the most common use cases, but the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
also has other configuration options that can be set with command-line
arguments. For help on command-line arguments, use the --help flag
to view the latest documentation:
./cloud-sql-proxy --help
See the
README on the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy GitHub repository
for additional examples of how to use Cloud SQL Auth Proxy command-line options.
Options for authenticating the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
When you authenticate the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, you enable it to access
Google Cloud on behalf of your application, using a set of Google
credentials. This is separate from database user authentication.
IAM user database authentication is integrated with the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
All of these options use an INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME as
the connection string to identify a Cloud SQL instance. You can find the
INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME on the Overview page for your
instance in the Google Cloud console . or by running the
following command:
gcloud sql instances describe --project PROJECT_ID INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME .
For example: gcloud sql instances describe --project myproject myinstance .
Some of these options use a JSON credentials file that includes the RSA private
key for the account. For instructions on creating a JSON credentials file for a
service account, see
Creating a service account .
The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy provides several alternatives for authentication, depending on
your environment. The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy checks for each of the following items, in the following
order, using the first one it finds to attempt to authenticate:
Credentials supplied by the credentials-file flag.
Use a service account to
create and download the associated JSON file, and set the --credentials-file
flag to the path of the file when you start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
The service account must have the
required permissions
for the Cloud SQL instance.
To use this option on the command-line, invoke the cloud-sql-proxy command with
the --credentials-file flag set to the path and filename of a JSON credential
file. The path can be absolute, or relative to the current working directory.
For example:
./cloud-sql-proxy --credentials-file PATH_TO_KEY_FILE \
INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME
For detailed instructions about adding IAM roles to a service account, see
Granting Roles to Service Accounts .
For more information about the roles Cloud SQL supports, see
IAM roles for Cloud SQL .
Credentials supplied by an access token.
Create an
access token and invoke the cloud-sql-proxy command with the
--token flag set to an OAuth 2.0 access token. For example:
./cloud-sql-proxy --token ACCESS_TOKEN \
INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME
Credentials supplied by an environment variable.
This option is similar to using the --credentials-file flag, except you specify
the JSON credential file you set in the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment
variable instead of using the --credentials-file command-line argument.
Credentials from an authenticated gcloud CLI client.
If you have installed the gcloud CLI
and have authenticated with your personal account, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy can use the
same account credentials. This method is especially helpful for getting a
development environment up and running.
To enable the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to use your gcloud CLI credentials,
use the following command to authenticate the gcloud CLI:
gcloud auth application-default login
Credentials associated with the Compute Engine instance.
If you are connecting to Cloud SQL from a Compute Engine instance, the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy can use the service account associated with the Compute Engine instance.
If the service account has the required permissions
for the Cloud SQL instance, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy authenticates successfully.
If the Compute Engine instance is in the same project as the Cloud SQL
instance, the default service account for the Compute Engine instance has the
necessary permissions for authenticating the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
If the two instances are in different projects, you must add the Compute Engine
instance's service account to the project containing the Cloud SQL
instance.
Environment's default service account
If the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy cannot find credentials in any of the places covered earlier, it
follows the logic documented in
Setting Up Authentication for Server to Server Production
Applications . Some environment (such as Compute Engine, App Engine, and others) provide a
default service account that your application can use to authenticate by default. If
you use a default service account, it must have the permissions outlined in
roles and permissions
For more information about Google Cloud's approach to authentication, see
Authentication overview .
Create a service account
If you are connecting from Compute Engine, make sure
your VM has the proper scope to connect using the Cloud SQL Admin API.
Configure the service account to have either of the following access scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice.admin
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service accounts page.
Go to Service accounts
Select the project that contains your Cloud SQL instance.
Click Create service account .
In the Service account name field, enter a descriptive name for the service account.
Change the Service account ID to a unique, recognizable value and then click
Create and continue .
Click the Select a role field and select one of the following roles:
Cloud SQL > Cloud SQL Client
Cloud SQL > Cloud SQL Editor
Cloud SQL > Cloud SQL Admin
Note: To create a service account with the required permissions, you must have
resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy permission. This permission is included in the
Project Owner, Project IAM Admin, and Organization Administrator roles.
You must also have enabled the Cloud SQL Admin API. If you are using the legacy project
roles (Viewer, Editor, Owner), the service account must have at least the Editor role.
Click Done to finish creating the service account.
Click the action menu for your new service account and then select Manage keys .
Click the Add key drop-down menu and then click Create new key .
Confirm that the key type is JSON and then click Create .
The private key file is downloaded to your machine. You can move it to another
location. Keep the key file secure.
Use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy with private IP
To connect to a Cloud SQL instance using private IP, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
must be on a resource with access to the same VPC network as the
instance.
The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy uses IP to establish a connection with your Cloud SQL instance.
By default, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy attempts to connect using a public IPv4 address.
If your Cloud SQL instance has only private IP or the instance has both
public and private IP configured, and you want the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to use the private
IP address, then you must provide the following option when you start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy:
--private-ip
Use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to connect to a write endpoint
You can use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to connect to a Cloud SQL primary instance
that's configured with a write endpoint. A write endpoint is a global domain name
service (DNS) name that you can use for connections instead of an IP address
for advanced disaster recovery (DR) such as performing a replica failover
or a switchover operation. If a replica failover or switchover operation occurs
for the primary instance, then the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy detects changes to the DNS
record automatically.
For more information on how to use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to connect to a write endpoint,
see
Connect database clients to instances using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or Cloud SQL Language Connectors .
Use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy with instances that have Private Service Connect enabled
You can use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to connect to a Cloud SQL instance with Private Service Connect enabled.
The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is a connector that provides secure access to this instance without a need for authorized networks or for configuring SSL.
To allow Cloud SQL Auth Proxy client connections, you must set up a DNS record which matches the recommended DNS name that's provided for the instance. The DNS record is a mapping between a DNS resource and a domain name.
For more information about using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to connect to instances with Private Service Connect enabled, see Connect using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy .
Run the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a separate process
Running the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a separate Cloud Shell terminal process can be useful, to avoid
mixing its console output with output from other programs. Use the syntax
shown below to invoke the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a separate process.
Linux
On Linux or macOS, use a trailing & on the command line to
launch the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a separate process:
. / cloud - sql - proxy INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME
--credentials-file PATH_TO_KEY_FILE &
Windows
In Windows PowerShell, use the Start-Process command to launch
the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a separate process:
Start - Process --filepath "cloud-sql-proxy.exe"
--ArgumentList "
--credentials-file PATH_TO_KEY_FILE INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME "
Run the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a Docker container
To run the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a Docker container, use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker
image available from the
Google Container Registry .
You can install the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker image using the following command:
docker pull gcr.io/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy:2.21.1
You can start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy using either TCP sockets or Unix sockets, with the
commands shown below.
Note: Unix sockets are not supported for applications written in the Java
programming language or for the Windows environment.
TCP sockets
docker run -d \
-v PATH_TO_KEY_FILE :/path/to/service-account-key.json \
-p 127 .0.0.1:5432:5432 \
gcr.io/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy:2.21.1 \
--address 0 .0.0.0 \
--credentials-file /path/to/service-account-key.json \
INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME
Unix sockets
docker run -d \
-v / PATH_TO_HOST_TARGET :/ PATH_TO_GUEST_TARGET \
-v PATH_TO_KEY_FILE :/path/to/service-account-key.json \
gcr.io/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy:2.21.1 --unix-socket /cloudsql \
--credentials-file /path/to/service-account-key.json/PATH_TO_KEY_FILE \
INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME
If you are using a container optimized image, use a writeable directory
in place of /cloudsql , for example:
v /mnt/stateful_partition/cloudsql:/cloudsql
If you are using the credentials provided by your Compute Engine instance,
do not include the credential_file parameter and the
-v PATH_TO_KEY_FILE :/path/to/service-account-key.json line.
Running the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy as a service
Running the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy as a background service is an option for local development
and production workloads. In development, when you need to access your
Cloud SQL instance, you can start the service in the background and stop it
when you're finished.
For production workloads, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy doesn't currently provide built-in
support for running as a Windows service, but third-party service managers can
be used to run it as a service. For example, you can use
NSSM
to configure the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy as a Windows service, and NSSM monitors the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy and restarts it automatically if it stops responding. See the
NSSM documentation for more information.
Note: If you run the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy as a service, keep in mind that it uses a secure
connection to communicate with Cloud SQL instances, but connections
from your application to the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy are not encrypted. For this reason, ensure
that only trusted users are able to access the address and port
that the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is listening on.
Enforce the use of the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
Enable the use of the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in Cloud SQL using ConnectorEnforcement .
If you're using a Private Service Connect-enabled instance , then there's a limitation. If the instance has connector enforcement enabled, then you can't create read replicas for the instance. Similarly, if the instance has read replicas, then you can't enable connector enforcement for the instance.
gcloud
The following command enforces the use of Cloud SQL connectors.
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME \
--connector-enforcement REQUIRED
To disable the enforcement, use the following line of code:
--connector-enforcement NOT_REQUIRED
The update doesn't trigger a restart.

Tips for working with Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
Invoke the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
All of the sample proxy invocations start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in the background, so a
prompt is returned. Reserve that Cloud Shell terminal for the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, to
avoid having its output mixed with the output from other programs. Also, the
output from the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy can help you diagnose connection problems, so it can be
helpful to capture in a log file. If you do not start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in the background,
the output goes to stdout unless redirected.
You do not have to use /cloudsql as the directory for the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy sockets. (That
directory name was chosen to minimize differences with App Engine
connection strings.) If you change the directory name, however, keep the overall
length to a minimum; it is incorporated in a longer string that has a length
limit imposed by the operating system. It depends on the system, but it's usually
between 91-108 characters. On Linux, the length is usually defined as 108, and
you can use the following command to check:
cat /usr/include/linux/un.h | grep "define UNIX_PATH_MAX"
Use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to connect to multiple instances
You can use one local Cloud SQL Auth Proxy client to connect to multiple Cloud SQL
instances. The way you do this depends on whether you are using Unix sockets
or TCP.
Unix sockets
To connect the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to multiple instances, you provide each instance
connection name as an argument to the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, in a space-separated list.
The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy connects to each instance when it starts.
You connect to each instance using its socket, in the specified
directory.
For example:
./cloud-sql-proxy --unix-socket /cloudsql \
myProject:us-central1:myInstance myProject:us-central1:myInstance2 &
psql -U myUser -h /cloudsql/myProject:us-central1:myInstance2
TCP sockets
When you connect using TCP, you specify a port on your machine for the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to listen on for each Cloud SQL instance. When connecting
to multiple Cloud SQL instances, each port specified must be unique
and available for use on your machine.
For example:
# Start the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy to connect to two different Cloud SQL instances
# Give the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy a unique port on your machine to use for each Cloud SQL instance.
./cloud-sql-proxy "myProject:us-central1:myInstance?port=5432" \
"myProject:us-central1:myInstance2?port=1234"
# Connect to "myInstance" using port 5432 on your machine:
psql -U myUser -h 127 .0.0.1 --port 5432
# Connect to "myInstance2" using port 1234 on your machine:
psql -U myUser -h 127 .0.0.1 --port 1234
Troubleshoot Cloud SQL Auth Proxy connections
The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker image is based on a specific version of the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
When a new version of the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy becomes available, pull the new
version of the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker image to keep your environment up to date. You
can see the current version of the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy by checking the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy GitHub releases page .
If you are having trouble connecting to your Cloud SQL instance using
the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, here are a few things to try to find what's causing the
problem.
Check the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy output.
Often, the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy output can help you determine the source of the problem
and how to solve it. Pipe the output to a file, or watch the Cloud Shell terminal where
you started the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
If you are getting a 403 notAuthorized error, and you are using a service
account to authenticate the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, make sure the service account has the
correct permissions .
You can check the service account by searching for its ID on the
IAM page . It must have
the cloudsql.instances.connect permission. The Cloud SQL Admin ,
Client and Editor predefined roles have this permission.
If you are connecting from App Engine and are getting a
403 notAuthorized error, check the app.yaml value
cloud_sql_instances for a misspelled or incorrect instance connection name.
Instance connection names are always in the format PROJECT:REGION:INSTANCE .
Also, check that the App Engine service account
(for example, $PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com) has
the Cloud SQL Client IAM role.
If the App Engine service lives in one project (project A) and the database
lives in another (project B), this error means the App Engine service
account has not been given the Cloud SQL Client IAM role
in the project with the database (project B).
Make sure to enable the Cloud SQL Admin API.
If it is not, you see output like Error 403: Access Not
Configured in your Cloud SQL Auth Proxy logs.
If you are including multiple instances in your instances list, make sure
you are using a comma as a delimiter, with no spaces. If you are using TCP,
make sure you are specifying different ports for each instance.
If you are connecting using UNIX sockets, confirm that the sockets were
created by listing the directory you provided when you started the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
If you have an outbound firewall policy, make sure it allows connections
to port 3307 on the target Cloud SQL instance.
Note: The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy uses 3307 to connect to the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy server.
Port 5432 is the default port for the PostgreSQL protocol
over a direct TCP connection (not using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy).
You can confirm that the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy started correctly by looking in the logs
under the Operations > Logging > Logs explorer section of the
Google Cloud console. A successful operation looks like the following:
2021 /06/14 15 :47:56 Listening on /cloudsql/ $PROJECT_ID : $REGION : $INSTANCE_NAME /5432 for $PROJECT_ID : $REGION : $INSTANCE_NAME
2021 /06/14 15 :47:56 Ready for new connections
Quota issues: When the Cloud SQL Admin API quota is breached, the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy starts up with the following error message:
There was a problem when parsing a instance configuration but ignoring due
to the configuration. Error: googleapi: Error 429 : Quota exceeded for quota
metric 'Queries' and limit 'Queries per minute per user' of service
'sqladmin.googleapis.com' for consumer ' project_number: $PROJECT_ID .,
rateLimitExceeded
Once an application connects to the proxy, the proxy reports the following
error:
failed to refresh the ephemeral certificate for $INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME :
googleapi: Error 429 : Quota exceeded for quota metric 'Queries' and limit
'Queries per minute per user' of service 'sqladmin.googleapis.com' for
consumer ' project_number: $PROJECT_ID ., rateLimitExceeded
Solution: Either identify the source of the quota problem, for example, an
application is misusing the connector and unnecessarily creating new
connections, or contact support to request an increase to the Cloud SQL
Admin API quota. If the quota error appears on startup, you must re-deploy the
application to restart the proxy. If the quota error appears after startup, a
re-deploy is unnecessary.
