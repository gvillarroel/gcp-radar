| SQL Server
You can use point-in-time-recovery (PITR) to restore your primary Cloud SQL
instances whether the instance is live, or is deleted. PITR lets you restore
the instance to a specific point-in-time. For a deleted instance, you
can restore the instance to a specific point-in-time to a new or existing
instance.
Cloud SQL provides the following options to restore your instance
using PITR:
Perform a PITR on a live instance
Perform a PITR using the backup vault
Perform a PITR on an unavailable instance
Perform a PITR on a deleted instance
For performing a PITR on an unavailable or deleted instance, you'll need to
find the
latest and earliest recovery time .
Perform a PITR
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Open the more actions menu for the instance you
want to recover and click Create clone .
Optionally, on the Create a clone page, update the ID of the
new clone.
Select Clone from an earlier point in time .
Enter a PITR time.
Click Create clone .

Perform a PITR using the backup vault
If your Cloud SQL instance is enabled to use
enhanced backups ,
then you can perform point-in-time-recovery for your instance using the
backup vault.
Note: If you're using Terraform or the Cloud SQL API to perform PITR
and your instance uses enhanced backups, then Cloud SQL uses the
PITR settings from the instance's associated backup plan.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Open the more actions menu for the instance you
want to recover and click Create clone .
Select Clone from an earlier point in time .
Enter a PITR time.
Click Create clone .
gcloud
To perform a PITR on an instance from the backup vault, you'll need to find the
data-source for the backup that is nearest to the time you want to perform
the PITR. To find the backup, see
List all the backups in the backup vault for an instance . Once you've identified the backup, run the following command to perform the PITR:
gcloud sql instances point - in - time - restore DATA_SOURCE TARGET_INSTANCE_NAME PITR_TIMESTAMP \
-- project = TARGET_PROJECT \
-- region = REGION
Replace the following:
DATA_SOURCE : the path of the data-source for the source instance.
that is closest to the PITR timestamp you want to recover to.
TARGET_INSTANCE_NAME : the name for the new instance that is created by the PITR operation.
PITR_TIMESTAMP : the UTC timestamp for the source
instance PITR log you want to restore your instance to, in
RFC 3339 format. For example, 2025-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.
TARGET_PROJECT : the project ID for the new instance.
REGION : the region of the target instance.
This field is required if the data source of source instance is located in a multi-region. The target instance region must be the same as the region of the source instance.
REST v1
To perform point-in-time recovery using a data source from the backup vault, use the
instances.pointInTimeRestore method with a POST request.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where you want to create the new instance.
DATASOURCE : the Backup and DR data source you want the service to use for the point-in-time restore operation.
PITR_TIMESTAMP : the UTC timestamp for the source instance PITR log you want to restore your instance to, in RFC 3339 format. For example, 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.

Perform a cross-project PITR
With enhanced backups, you can restore a Cloud SQL instance to a
project other than the one where either the source instance or backup vault is
located.
Cross-project PITR is supported only through the gcloud CLI and REST APIs.
To perform a cross-project PITR, do one of the following:
If you're using the gcloud CLI, set the --project flag to the
project where you want to create the target instance.
If you're using REST APIs, set the PROJECT_ID field to the project where
you want to create the target instance.
Perform PITR on an unavailable instance
Console
You might want to recover an
instance that isn't available
to a different zone because of the following reasons:
The zone in which the instance is configured isn't accessible. This
instance has a FAILED state.
The instance is undergoing maintenance. This instance has a
MAINTENANCE state.
To recover an unavailable instance, complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Find the row of the instance to clone.
In the Actions column, click the
more_vert More Actions menu.
Click Create clone .
On the Create a clone page, complete the following actions:
In the Instance ID field, update the instance ID, if needed.
Click Clone from an earlier point in time .
In the Point in time field, select a date and time from which you
want to clone data. This recovers the state of the instance from that point
in time.
Click Create clone .
While the clone initializes, you're returned to the instance listing page.

Perform PITR on a deleted instance
To use PITR to restore a deleted instance, you'll need:
the PITR timestamp ( timestamp ) you want to restore your instance to
the target instance name
the time the source instance was deleted ( source-instance-deletion-time )
You can use
PITR on a deleted instance using gcloud CLI or the Cloud SQL
API only. For more information, see
Restore a deleted instance using a PITR .

Find your PITR window
To find your deleted instance's PITR window, get the
earliest and latest recovery time
for your instance. You can select anytime timestamp in this window to
perform a PITR.
Find source instance deletion
The source-instance-deletion-time and log-retention-days for the
deleted instance are stored with the retained backups for your instance after
deletion. To find a list of all available backups for your deleted instance, see
List retained backups .
Once you identify the backup you want to use, use the
gcloud sql backups describe
command to get the source-instance-deletion-time .
Restore using a PITR
To restore your deleted instance using a PITR, run the following command:
gcloud sql instances clone SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME \
NEW_INSTANCE_NAME \
--point-in-time=' PITR_TIMESTAMP ' \
--source-instance-deletion-time= SOURCE_INSTANCE_DELETION_TIMESTAMP
Replace the following:
SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the source instance
that you want to restore.
NEW_INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the new instance.
PITR_TIMESTAMP : the UTC timestamp for the source
instance PITR log you want to restore your instance to, in

the backup that is closest to the PITR timestamp you want to recover
to.
PITR_TIMESTAMP : the UTC timestamp for the source
instance PITR log you want to restore your instance to, in
RFC 3339 format. For example,
2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.
TARGET_PROJECT : the project ID of your Cloud SQL
instance.

Get the earliest and latest recovery time
For an available instance, you can perform a PITR to any timestamp in the
instance's PITR window. The PITR window starts a the earliest recovery time
and ends at the latest recovery time. If the
instance is unavailable and the instance logs are stored in Cloud Storage ,
or the instance was deleted and had
PITR retention enabled ,
then you can retrieve the earliest and latest recovery time, and perform the
PITR to any timestamp in that window.
In all cases, you can restore the instance to a different primary or secondary zone
by providing values for the preferred zones.
