Fields
name
string
Output only. The resource name of the backup. Format: projects/{project}/backups/{backup}.
kind
string
Output only. This is always sql#backup .
selfLink
string
Output only. The URI of this resource.
type
enum ( SqlBackupType )
Output only. The type of this backup. The type can be "AUTOMATED", "ON_DEMAND" or “FINAL”.
description
string
The description of this backup.
instance
string
The name of the source database instance.
location
string
The storage location of the backups. The location can be multi-regional.
backupInterval
object ( Interval )
Output only. This output contains the following values: startTime: All database writes up to this time are available. endTime: Any database writes after this time aren't available.
state
enum ( SqlBackupState )
Output only. The status of this backup.
error
object ( OperationError )
Output only. Information about why the backup operation fails (for example, when the backup state fails).
kmsKey
string
Output only. This output contains the encryption configuration for a backup and the resource name of the KMS key for disk encryption.
kmsKeyVersion
string
Output only. This output contains the encryption status for a backup and the version of the KMS key that's used to encrypt the Cloud SQL instance.
backupKind
enum ( SqlBackupKind )
Output only. Specifies the kind of backup, PHYSICAL or DEFAULT_SNAPSHOT.
timeZone
string
Output only. This output contains a backup time zone. If a Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance has a different time zone from the backup's time zone, then the restore to the instance doesn't happen.
databaseVersion
enum ( SqlDatabaseVersion )
Output only. The database version of the instance of at the time this backup was made.
instanceDeletionTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Optional. Output only. Timestamp in UTC of when the instance associated with this backup is deleted.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
instanceSettings
object ( DatabaseInstance )
Optional. Output only. The instance setting of the source instance that's associated with this backup.
backupRun
string
Output only. The mapping to backup run resource used for IAM validations.
satisfiesPzs
boolean
Output only. This status indicates whether the backup satisfies PZS.
The status is reserved for future use.
satisfiesPzi
boolean
Output only. This status indicates whether the backup satisfies PZI.
The status is reserved for future use.

expiration can be only one of the following:
ttlDays
string ( int64 format)
