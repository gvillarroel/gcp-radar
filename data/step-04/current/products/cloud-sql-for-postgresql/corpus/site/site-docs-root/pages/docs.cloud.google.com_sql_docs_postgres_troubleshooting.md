Issue
Troubleshooting
You can't see the current operation's status.
The Google Cloud console reports only success or failure when the operation
is done. It isn't designed to show warnings or other updates.
Run the
gcloud sql operations list command to list all
operations for the given Cloud SQL instance.
You want to find out who issued an on-demand backup operation.
The user interface doesn't show the user who started an operation.
Look in the logs
and filter by text to find the user. You may need to use audit logs for
private information. Relevant log files include:
cloudsql.googleapis.com/postgres.log
If Cloud Audit Logs is enabled and
you have the required permissions to view them,
cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity may also be available.
After an instance is deleted, you can't take a backup of the instance.
If you delete an instance without taking a final backup of the data, then no data recovery is possible. However, if you restore the instance, then Cloud SQL also restores the backups. For more
information on recovering a deleted instance, see
Retain backups after instance deletion .
If you have done an export operation, create a new instance
and then do an import operation to recreate the database. Exports are
written to Cloud Storage and imports are read from there.
Note: Cloud SQL recommends that you take a final backup of your data before you delete the instance. This way, you can recreate any instances that you delete accidentally without contacting Cloud Customer Care .
An automated backup is stuck for many hours and can't be canceled.
Backups can take a long time depending on the database size.
If you really need to cancel the operation, you can ask
customer support to force restart the instance.
A restore operation can fail when one or more users referenced in the
SQL dump file don't exist.
Before restoring a SQL dump, all the database users who own objects or
were granted permissions on objects in the dumped database must exist in the
target database. If they don't, the restore operation fails to recreate the
objects with the original ownership or permissions.
Create the database users before restoring the SQL dump.
You want to increase the number of days that you can keep automatic
backups from seven to 30 days, or longer.
You can
configure the number of automated backups to retain ,
from 1 to 365. Automated backups get pruned
regularly based on the retention value configured. Unfortunately, this means that the
currently visible backups are the only automated backups you can restore from.
To keep backups indefinitely, you can
create
an on-demand backup , as they are not deleted in the same way as
automated backups. On-demand backups remain indefinitely. That is, they
remain until they're deleted or the instance they belong to is deleted.
Because that type of backup is not deleted automatically, it can affect
billing.
An automated backup failed and you didn't receive an email notification.
To have Cloud SQL notify you of the backup's status, configure a log-based alert .
An instance is repeatedly failing because it is cycling between the
failure and backup restore states. Attempts to connect to and use the
database following restore fail.
There could be too many open connections. Too many
connections can result from errors that occur in the middle of a
connection where there are no autovacuum settings to clean
up dead connections.
Cycling can occur if any custom code is using retry logic that
doesn't stop after a few failures.
There could be too much traffic. Use connection pooling and other
best practices for
connectivity .
Things to try:
Verify that the database is
set up for autovacuum .
Check if there is any connection retry logic set up in custom code.
Turn down traffic until the database recovers and then slowly turn
traffic back up.
You find you are missing data when performing a backup/restore operation.
Tables were created as unlogged. For example:
CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE ... .
These tables are not included in a restore from a backup:
The contents of unlogged tables doesn't survive failover on an HA instance.
Unlogged tables don't survive postgres crashes.
Unlogged tables are not replicated to read replicas.
Unlogged tables are automatically wiped during backup restore.
The solution is to avoid using unlogged tables if you want to restore those
tables through a backup. If you're restoring from a database that already
has unlogged tables, then you can dump the database to a file, and reload the
data after modifying the dumped file to ALTER TABLE to
SET LOGGED on those tables.
Unable to delete an instance when you elect to
take a final backup at instance deletion.
When you delete an instance, you're required to confirm whether you want to
take a final backup for your instance prior to deleting it. If you enabled
final backup using the final-backup instance setting, then the selection
you make when you delete your instance must match the final backup
instance configuration you set when you enabled final backup for your
instance. To mitigate this issue, do one of the following:
Set the final backup value to match the instance's existing backup
configuration.
Leave the final backup field empty when you delete your instance. If
you leave the field empty, then Cloud SQL takes the final backup
configuration set in instance settings to take a final backup and define
its retention.
To view your instance's final backup instance configuration, see
View instance information .
Unable to create a replica instance after successfully creating a
primary instance with the final backup setting.
If you create a new instance with the final backup instance setting
enabled, then you must update the final backup organization policy
to apply the backup configurations to the primary instance only.
Final backups aren't supported for replica instances.
For more information, see
Cloud SQL organization policies .
Cancel import and export
Issue
Troubleshooting
Error message: You can't cancel operation [operation-ID] because
this operation isn't in progress.
You're trying to cancel an import or export operation that's completed,
failed, or cancelled. If the operation is running, you can cancel it.
Error message: You can't cancel operation [operation-ID] because
Cloud SQL doesn't support the cancellation of an [operation-type]
operation.
Cloud SQL
doesn't support the cancellation of the operation because it has an operation type other than IMPORT
or EXPORT .
Error message: The [operation-type] operation isn't cancelled. Wait
and retry in a few seconds.
Cloud SQL can't cancel the import or export operation at this time.
Try again in a few seconds. If the problem persists, contact
Google Cloud Support .
Clone
Issue
Troubleshooting
Cloning fails with constraints/sql.restrictAuthorizedNetworks error.
The cloning operation is blocked by the Authorized Networks configuration.
Authorized Networks are configured for public IP addresses in the Connectivity section
of the Google Cloud console, and cloning is not permitted due to
security considerations .
Remove all Authorized Networks entries from the Cloud SQL
instance if you can. Otherwise,
create a replica
without any Authorized Networks entries.
Error message: Failed to create subnetwork. Couldn't find free
blocks in allocated IP ranges. Please allocate new ranges for this service
provider. Help Token: [help-token-id].
You're trying to use the Google Cloud console to clone an instance with a private IP
address, but you didn't specify the allocated IP range that you want
to use and the source instance isn't created with the specified range. As
a result, the cloned instance is created in a random range.
Use gcloud to clone the instance and provide a value for
the --allocated-ip-range-name parameter. For more information,
see Cloning an instance with a private IP .
Connect
Issue
Troubleshooting
Aborted connection .
The issue might be:
Networking instability.
No response to TCP keep-alive commands (either the client or the
server isn't responsive, possibly overloaded)
The database engine connection lifetime was exceeded and the server
ends the connection.
Applications must tolerate network failures and follow
best practices
such as connection pooling and retrying. Most connection poolers catch
these errors where possible. Otherwise the application must either retry or
fail gracefully.
For connection retry, we recommend the following methods:
Exponential
backoff . Increase the time interval between each retry, exponentially.
Add randomized backoff also.
Combining these methods helps reduce throttling.
Error message: Login failed for user ""
You might encounter this login error during
Microsoft Entra ID authentication .
To resolve this issue, make sure that a SQL Server login exists for this
Microsoft Entra ID user.
Network connectivity issues with private IP instances
You might experience some of the following issues during integration
setup:
Slow operations to create Microsoft Entra ID logins
Unable to create Microsoft Entra ID logins
Unable to connect to the instance using Microsoft Entra ID authentication
For more information on how to help address these issues, see
Troubleshooting Microsoft Entra ID integration .
Certificate verify failed .
The client certificates have expired or the path to the certificates isn't correct.
Regenerate the certificates by recreating them .
FATAL: database 'user' does not exist .
gcloud sql connect --user only works with the default
postgres user.
Connect with the default user , then change
users.
You want to find out who is connected.
Log into the database and run this command:
SELECT datname,
usename,
application_name as appname,
client_addr,
state,
now () - backend_start as conn_age,
now () - state_change as last_activity_age
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE backend_type = 'client backend'
ORDER BY 6 DESC
LIMIT 20
Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames:
Host: localhost. is not in the cert's altnames .
The host address does not match the address in the
server certificate's alternative names.
If you are using Node.js with verify-full or its equivalent,
please use the DNS name for the servername parameter.
The DNS name can be found in the server
certificate using openssl . For example,
openssl x509 -in server-cert.pem -noout -text |grep 'DNS:' .
ssl: {
rejectUnauthorized: true,
ca: fs.readFileSync ( "/path/to/server/CA" ) ,
servername: 'N-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx.us-central1.sql.goog'
}
Create instances
Issue
Troubleshooting
Error message: The zone or region does not have sufficient
resources to handle the request at the moment.
The selected zone lacks capacity for the requested resources or
the VM type at the time of the instance creation request.
There might be simultaneous high operational demand in that specific
regional location at the time of request.
To resolve this issue, retry creating the instance
in another zone or retry creating the instance in the same zone that received
the error at a different time of day.
Error message: Failed to create subnetwork. Couldn't
find free blocks in allocated IP ranges. Please allocate new ranges for
this service provider .
There are no more available addresses in the allocated IP range. There
can be several possible scenarios:
The size of the allocated IP range for the private service connection
is smaller than /24.
The size of the allocated IP range for the private service connection
is too small for the number of Cloud SQL instances.
The requirement on the size of allocated IP range will be larger if
instances are created in multiple regions.
See allocated range size
To resolve this issue, you can either expand the
existing allocated IP range or allocate an additional IP range to the
private service connection. For more information, see
Allocate an IP address range .
If you used the --allocated-ip-range-name flag while creating
the Cloud SQL instance, you may only expand the specified IP range.
If you're allocating a new range, take care that the allocation doesn't
overlap with any existing allocations.
After creating a new IP range, update the vpc peering with the following
command:
gcloud services vpc-peerings update \
--service = servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--ranges = OLD_RESERVED_RANGE_NAME , NEW_RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \
--network = VPC_NETWORK \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--force
If you're expanding an existing allocation, take care to increase only the
allocation range and not decrease it. For example, if the original allocation
was 10.0.10.0/24, then make the new allocation at least 10.0.10.0/23.
In general, if starting from a /24 allocation, decrementing the /mask by
1 for each condition (additional instance type group, additional region) is
a good rule of thumb. For example, if trying to create both instance type
groups on the same allocation, going from /24 to /23 is enough.
After expanding an existing IP range, update the vpc peering with
following command:
gcloud services vpc-peerings update \
--service = servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--ranges = RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \
--network = VPC_NETWORK \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Error message: Failed to create subnetwork. Router status is
temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. Help Token:
[token-ID] .
Try to create the Cloud SQL instance again.
Error message: HTTPError 400: Invalid request: Incorrect Service Networking config for instance: PROJECT_ID : INSTANCE_NAME :SERVICE_NETWORKING_NOT_ENABLED.
Enable the Service Networking API using the following command and try to create the Cloud SQL instance again.
gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Error message: Failed to create subnetwork. Required
'compute.projects.get' permission for PROJECT_ID .
When you create an instance using with a Private IP address, a service
account is created just-in-time using the Service Networking API. If
you have only recently enabled the Service Networking API, then the
service account might not get created and the instance creation fails. In
this case, you must wait for the service account to propagate throughout
the system or manually add it with the required permissions.
Error message: More than 3 subject alternative names are not
allowed.
You're trying to use a custom SAN to add more than three DNS names to
the server certificate of a Cloud SQL instance. You can't add more
than three DNS names to the instance.
Error message: Subject alternative names %s is too long. The
maximum length is 253 characters.
Make sure that any DNS names that you want to add to the server
certificate of a Cloud SQL instance don't have more than 253
characters.
Error message: Subject alternative name %s is invalid.
Verify that the DNS names that you want to add to the server
certificate of a Cloud SQL instance meet the following criteria:
They don't have wildcard characters.
They don't have trailing dots.
They meet RFC
1034 specifications.
Export
Issue
Troubleshooting
HTTP Error 409: Operation failed because another operation was
already in progress.
There is already a pending operation for your instance. Only one operation
is allowed at a time. Try your request after the current operation is
complete.
HTTP Error 403: The service account does not have the required
permissions for the bucket.
Ensure that the bucket exists and the service account for the Cloud SQL
instance (which is performing the export) has the
Storage Object Creator role
( roles/storage.objectCreator ) to allow export to the bucket. See
IAM roles for Cloud Storage .
CSV export worked but SQL export failed.
CSV and SQL formats do export differently. The SQL format exports the
entire database, and likely takes longer to complete. The CSV format lets
you define which elements of the database to include in the export.
Use CSV exports
to export only what you need.
Export is taking too long.
Cloud SQL does not support concurrent synchronous operations.
Use
export offloading . At a high level, in export offloading, instead of
issuing an export on the source instance, Cloud SQL spins up an
offload instance to perform the export. Export offloading has several
advantages, including increased performance on the source instance and the
unblocking of administrative operations while the export is running. With
export offloading, total latency can increase by the amount of time it takes
to bring up the offload instance. Generally, for reasonably sized exports,
latency is not significant. However, if your export is small enough, then
you may notice the increase in latency.
Create Extension error.
The dump file contains references to unsupported extension.
Edit the dump file to remove the
references .
Error using pg_dumpall .
Using the pg_dumpall utility with the --global flag
requires the
superuser role, but
this role isn't supported in Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL. To prevent errors from
occurring while performing export operations that include user names, also use the
--no-role-passwords flag.
The export operation times out before exporting anything, and you see
the error message Could not receive data from client: Connection reset
by peer.
If Cloud Storage does not receive any data within a certain
time frame, typically around seven minutes, the connection resets. It's
possible the initial export query is taking too long to run.
Do a manual export using the
pg_dump tool .
You want exports to be automated.
Cloud SQL does not provide a way to automate exports.
You could build your own automated export system using Google Cloud
products such as Cloud Scheduler, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Run functions,
similar to this article on
automating backups .
Flags
Issue
Troubleshooting
You set the time zone for a session, but it expires when you log off.
Connect to the database and set the
database time zone to the one you want, either per user or per database.
In Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, you can specify the following.
These settings remain after a session is closed, mimicking a
.conf configuration:
ALTER DATABASE dbname SET TIMEZONE TO ' timezone ' ;
ALTER USER username SET TIMEZONE TO ' timezone ' ;
These settings apply only to new connections to the database. To see the
change to the time zone, disconnect from the instance and then reconnect to
it.
High availability
Issue
Troubleshooting
You can't find the metrics for a manual failover.
Only automatic failovers go into the metrics .
Cloud SQL instance resources (CPU and RAM) are near 100% usage,
causing the high availability instance to go down.
The instance machine size is too small for the load.
Edit the instance to upgrade to a larger machine size to get more CPUs
and memory.
Import
Issue
Troubleshooting
Error message: permission denied for schema public
For PostgreSQL versions 15 and later, if the target database is created from template0 , then importing data might fail. To resolve this issue, provide public schema privileges to the cloudsqlsuperuser user by running the GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO cloudsqlsuperuser SQL command.
HTTP Error 409: Operation failed because another operation was already in progress .
There is already a pending operation for your instance. Only one operation
is allowed at a time. Try your request after the current operation is
complete.
The import operation is taking too long.
Too many active connections can interfere with import operations.
Close unused operations. Check the CPU and memory usage of your
Cloud SQL instance to make sure there
are plenty of resources available. The best way to ensure maximum resources
for the import is to restart the instance before beginning the operation.
A restart:
Closes all connections.
Ends any tasks that may be consuming resources.
An import operation can fail when one or more users referenced in the
dump file don't exist.
Before importing a dump file, all the database users who own objects or
were granted permissions on objects in the dumped database must exist in the
target database. If they don't, the import operation fails to recreate the
objects with the original ownership or permissions.
Create the database users before importing.
After importing data, the size of your data disk usage is much higher.
There may be an unexpected disk usage after importing data. This usage may
be because of using point-in-time recovery .
To resolve this, after you import data, disable point-in-time recovery
if you want to delete logs and recover storage. Keep in mind that decreasing
the storage used doesn't shrink the size of the storage provisioned for
the instance.
Error message: GRANT stderr: ERROR: must be member of role ROLE_NAME
This error message appears if you try to import a SQL dump file that's uploaded in Cloud Storage
to a Cloud SQL database, and the import job has run for about four days.
ROLE_NAME is a custom database role defined in the source
PostgreSQL database. The default cloudsqlsuperuser user imports the
SQL dump file. However, this user might not belong to the ROLE_NAME role.
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps:
Create the ROLE_NAME role in the destination database where you're
importing the SQL dump file.
Don't use the cloudsqlsuperuser user to import the file. Instead,
in the destination database, specify a user who's a member of the ROLE_NAME role. To specify the user, run the following command:
gcloud sql import sql INSTANCE URI [--async]
[--database=DATABASE, -d DATABASE] [--user=USER] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
Integrate with Vertex AI
Issue
Troubleshooting
Error message: Google ML integration API is supported only on Postgres version 12 or above.
To enable the Vertex AI integration in Cloud SQL, you must have a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL database, version 12 or later. To upgrade your database to this version, see Upgrade the database major version in-place .
Error message: Google ML Integration API is not supported on shared core instance. Please upsize your machine type.
If you selected a shared core for the machine type of your instance, then you can't enable the Vertex AI integration in Cloud SQL. Upgrade your machine type to dedicated core. For more information, see Machine Type .
Error message: Google ML Integration is unsupported for this maintenance version. Please follow https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/self-service-maintenance to update the maintenance version of the instance.

Logging
Issue
Troubleshooting
Logging uses a lot of CPU and memory on your Cloud SQL instance.
Logging needs to be tuned.
The log_statement flag can be set to none and the
logging_collector flag can be set to off. If logging is still
occurring, there may be other log-related flags that can be tuned. You can
edit the instance to modify these flags.
Audit logs are not found.
Data-Access logs are only written if the operation is an authenticated
user-driven API call that creates, modifies, or reads user-created data,
or if the operation accesses configuration files or metadata of resources.
Operations information is not found in logs.
You want to find more information about an operation.
For example, a user was deleted but you can't find out who did it.
The logs show the
operation started but don't provide any more information. You must
enable
audit logging for detailed and personal identifying
information (PII) like this to be logged.
Log files are hard to read.
You'd rather view the logs as json or text.You can use the
gcloud logging read
command along with linux post-processing commands to download the logs.
To download the logs as JSON:
gcloud logging read \
"resource.type=cloudsql_database \
AND logName=projects/ PROJECT_ID \
/logs/cloudsql.googleapis.com%2F LOG_NAME " \
--format json \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--freshness = "1d" \
> downloaded-log.json
To download the logs as TEXT:
gcloud logging read \
"resource.type=cloudsql_database \
AND logName=projects/ PROJECT_ID \
/logs/cloudsql.googleapis.com%2F LOG_NAME " \
--format json \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--freshness = "1d" | jq -rnc --stream 'fromstream(1|truncate_stream(inputs)) \
| .textPayload' \
--order = asc
> downloaded-log.txt
Query logs are not found in PostgreSQL logs.
You need to enable the pgaudit flags.
From a terminal, connect to your database:
gcloud sql connect INSTANCE_NAME
Run this command to create the extension:
CREATE EXTENSION pgaudit ;
Exit the database, and from a terminal run the following command:
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME \
--database-flags = cloudsql.enable_pgaudit = on,pgaudit.log = all
Manage instances
Issue
Troubleshooting
You want to find out what queries are running now.
Connect to the database and run the following query:
SELECT datname,
username,
application_name as appname,
client_addr,
state,
now() - backend_start as conn_age,
now() - xact_start as xact_age,
now() - query_start as query_age,
now() - state_change as last_activity_age,
wait_event_type,
wait_event,
query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state <> 'idle'
ORDER BY 8 DESC
LIMIT 20;
You want to find out what units are being used for a specific field.
Connect to the database and run the following query
(using your own FIELD_NAME ):
SELECT name, setting, unit FROM pg_settings
WHERE name = ' FIELD_NAME ' .
You want to find the current value of a database setting.
Connect to the database and run the following query
(using your own SETTING_NAME ):
SHOW SETTING_NAME ;
Run SHOW ALL; to see all settings.
You want to stop a blocked background process.
The user needs to have the pg_signal_backend role.
Run the following commands:
GRANT pg_signal_backend TO USERNAME ;
Find the process ID of the blocked or stuck process:
SELECT pid, username, state, query FROM pg_stat_activity ;
Stop a running or idle process using these commands:
SELECT pg_cancel_backend ( pid )
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE username = ' USERNAME ' ;
SELECT pg_terminate_backend ( pid )
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE username = ' USERNAME ' ;
Instance is nearing 100% consumption of transaction IDs.
Your internal monitoring warns that the instance is nearing 100%
consumption of transaction IDs. You want to avoid transaction wraparound,
which can block writes.
The autovacuum job might be blocked, or might not be reclaiming the
transaction IDs fast enough to keep up with the workload.
In order to avoid any outages due to transaction wraparound problem, you
can review these self-servicing tips
for dealing with TXID wraparound.
For general tuning advice, see
Optimizing, monitoring, and troubleshooting vacuum operations in PostgreSQL .
Temporary storage increased automatic storage.
Automatic storage is enabled.
Restart deletes the temporary files but not
reduce the storage. Only
customer support can reset the instance size.
Data is being automatically deleted.
Most likely a script is running somewhere in your environment.
Look in the logs around the time of the deletion and see if there's a
rogue script running from a dashboard or another automated process.
The instance cannot be deleted.
You might see the error message ERROR: (gcloud.sql.instances.delete) HTTP Error
409: The instance or operation is not in an appropriate state to handle the
request , or the instance may have a INSTANCE_RISKY_FLAG_CONFIG
flag status.
Some possible explanations include:
Another operation is in progress. Cloud SQL operations do not
run concurrently. Wait for the other operation to complete.
The INSTANCE_RISKY_FLAG_CONFIG warning is triggered
whenever at least one beta flag is being used. Remove the
risky flag settings and restart the instance
The instance is stuck due to large temporary data size.
The system can create many temporary tables at one time, depending on
the queries and the load.
Unfortunately, you can't shrink the ibtmp1 file by any method
other than restarting the service.
One mitigation option is to create the temporary table with
ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED , so it is stored
in file-per-table tablespaces in the temporary file directory. However, the
downside is performance costs associated with creating and removing a
file-per-table tablespace for each temporary table.
Fatal error during upgrade.
Logs may reveal more, but in any case
customer support may be needed to
force re-create the instance.
Instance is stuck on restart after running out of disk space.
Automatic storage increase capability isn't enabled.
If your instance runs out of storage, and the automatic storage increase
capability isn't enabled, your instance goes offline. To avoid this issue,
you can
edit the instance to enable automatic storage increase.
Your on-premises primary instance is stuck.
Google Cloud can't help with instances that are not in Cloud SQL.
Slow shutdown on restart.
When an instance shuts down, any outstanding connections that don't
end within 60 seconds make the shutdown unclean.
By having connections that last less than 60 seconds, most unclean
shutdowns can be avoided, including connections from the database
command prompt. If you keep these connections open for hours or days,
shutdowns can be unclean.
A user cannot be deleted.
The user probably has objects in the database that depend on it. You
need to drop those objects or reassign them to another user.
Find out which objects are dependent on the user, then drop or reassign
those objects to a different user.
This thread on Stack Exchange discusses how to find the objects owned by
the user.
Particular queries are running slow.
Queries can be slow for many reasons, mostly due to specific database
aspects. One reason that can involve Cloud SQL is network latency,
when the source (writer or reader) resource and the destination
(Cloud SQL) resource are in different regions.
Refer to
general performance tips in particular.
For slow database inserts, updates, or deletes, consider the following
actions:
Check the locations of the writer and database; sending data a long
distance introduces latency.
Check the location of the reader and database; latency affects read
performance even more than write performance
To reduce the latency the recommendation is to locate both the source and
destination resources in the same region.
Out of memory is indicated but monitoring charts don't show that.
An instance can fail and report Out of memory but the
Google Cloud console or Cloud Monitoring charts seem to show there's still
memory remaining.
There are other factors beside your workload that can impact memory
usage, such as the number of active connections and internal overhead
processes. These aren't always reflected in the monitoring charts.
Ensure that the instance has enough overhead to account for your workload
plus some additional overhead.
Recovering a deleted instance.
All data on an instance, including backups, is permanently lost when
that instance is deleted.
To preserve your data,
export it to Cloud Storage before you
delete an instance .
The Cloud SQL Admin role includes the permission to delete the
instance. To prevent accidental deletion, grant this role only as needed.
You want to rename an existing Cloud SQL instance.
Renaming an existing instance is not supported.
There are other ways to accomplish the goal by creating a new instance.
You can clone the instance
you want to rename and set a new name for the
cloned instance. This allows you to create the new instance without
having to import data manually. Just as when creating a new instance,
the cloned instance has a new IP address.
You can export
data from your instance into a Cloud Storage
bucket, create a new instance with the new name you want, and then
import the data
into the new instance.
In both cases, you can delete your old instance after the operation is
done. We recommend going with the cloning route since it has no impact on
performance and doesn't require you to redo any instance configuration
settings such as flags, machine type, storage size and memory.
Error when deleting an instance.
If deletion protection is enabled for an instance, confirm your plans
to delete the instance. Then
disable deletion protection before deleting the instance.
Private Service Connect
Issue
Troubleshooting
The service attachment of the instance doesn't accept the Private Service Connect endpoint.
Check the endpoint's status.
gcloud
To check the status, use the gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe command.
gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe ENDPOINT_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--region = REGION_NAME \
| grep pscConnectionStatus
Make the following replacements:
ENDPOINT_NAME : the name of the endpoint
PROJECT_ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the endpoint
REGION_NAME : the region name for the endpoint
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the Private Service Connect endpoint
REGION_NAME : the name of the region
ENDPOINT_NAME : the name of the endpoint
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT_NAME
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT_NAME "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT_NAME " | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"kind": "compute#forwardingRule",
"id": " ENDPOINT_ID ",
"creationTimestamp": "2024-05-09T12:03:21.383-07:00",

"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT_NAME ",
"network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/default",
"serviceDirectoryRegistrations": [

"fingerprint": " FINGERPRINT_ID ",
"pscConnectionId": " CONNECTION_ID ",
"pscConnectionStatus": "ACCEPTED",
"allowPscGlobalAccess": true
}
Verify that the status of the endpoint is ACCEPTED . If the status is PENDING , then the instance isn't allowing the Google Cloud project that contains the endpoint. Make sure that the network project in which the endpoint is created is allowed. For more information, see Edit an instance with Private Service Connect enabled .
ERROR: (gcloud.compute.forwarding-rules.create) Could not fetch resource: The resource 'projects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET_NAME' was not found
This error message can occur when reserving a static internal IP address for the Private Service Connect endpoint.
Make sure the subnet specified exists in the project specified by the URI. If you want to create an endpoint in a service project but use a subnet from a Shared VPC network,
you need to specify the subnet by its URI and use the host project's project ID in the URI.
For more information, see Create the endpoint manually .
ERROR: (gcloud.compute.forwarding-rules.create) Could not fetch resource:
- The resource 'projects/PROJECT_ID/global/networks/NETWORK_NAME' was not found
This error message can occur when you create a Private Service Connect endpoint manually.
Make sure the network specified exists in the project specified by the URI. If you want to create an endpoint in a service project but use a Shared VPC network,
you need to specify the network by its URI and use the host project's project ID in the URI.
For more information, see Create the endpoint manually .
Invalid consumer network status for PSC auto connection .
The consumer network is either not configured correctly, or not
configured at all, and therefore, no endpoint is available to connect to. To
connect to the endpoint, you'll need to check the status of the endpoint,
and fix the error before trying to connect again.
To check the status of an endpoint,
see Retrive the endpoint .
The status of the endpoint can be one of the following:
CONNECTION_POLICY_MISSING : there is no matching service
connection policy on the consumer network. Service connection policies
are configured by network, by region. To reconfigure the network,
see Update a service connection policy .
CONSUMER_INSTANCE_PROJECT_NOT_ALLOWLISTED : there is a
matching service connection policy, but the
Service
instance scope field in the policy is not configured to allow
connection to this Cloud SQL instance. Update the policy to
configure the value of the Service instance scope field
( --producer-instance-location ) with the project, folder, or
organization where the Cloud SQL instance resides. To reconfigure
the service connection policy, see
Update a service connection policy .
POLICY_LIMIT_REACHED : the service connection policy
has reached its endpoint limit. To resolve, you'll need to increase the
endpoint limit by
updating the service connection policy .
No permission to create a service connection policy .
You don't have the required permissions to create a service
connection policy. To create a service connection policy, you need the
Compute Network Admin IAM role. For more information,
see Roles and permissions .
The network attachment is unable to accept connections from the
Private Service Connect interface when
using
Private Service Connect outbound connectivity .
If your external network is unable to accept connections from
the Private Service Connect interface,
then the connection policies on your network attachment may not be
configured correctly.
Network attachments need to be configured to either
accept all connections automatically, or configured manually
with a list of accepted connections.
For more information, see Connection policies .
Use the following command to verify the accepted connections
in your network attachment:
gcloud compute network-attachments describe default
--region = REGION_ID
If the Private Service Connect interface isn't on the accepted
list, then update your network attachment . For more information, see
Manage network attachments .
Replication
Issue
Troubleshooting
Read replica didn't start replicating on creation.
There's probably a more specific error in the log files.
Inspect the logs in
Cloud Logging to find the actual error.
Unable to create read replica - invalidFlagValue error.
One of the flags in the request is invalid. It could be a flag you
provided explicitly or one that was set to a default value.
First, check that the value of the max_connections flag is
greater than or equal to the value on the primary.
If the max_connections flag is set appropriately,
inspect the logs in
Cloud Logging to find the actual error.
Unable to create read replica - unknown error.
There's probably a more specific error in the log files.
Inspect the logs in
Cloud Logging to find the actual error.
If the error is: set Service Networking service account as
servicenetworking.serviceAgent role on consumer project , then disable
and re-enable the Service
Networking API . This action creates the service account necessary
to continue with the process.
Disk is full.
The primary instance disk size can become full during replica creation.
Edit the primary instance to upgrade it to a larger disk size.
Disk space increases significantly.
A slot that's not actively used to track data causes PostgreSQL to
hold onto WAL segments indefinitely, causing the disk space to grow indefinitely. If you use
the logical replication and decoding features in Cloud SQL, replication slots are
created and dropped automatically. Unused replication slots can be detected by querying the
pg_replication_slots
system view and filtering on the active column. Unused
slots can be dropped to remove WAL segments using the
pg_drop_replication_slot command.
The replica instance is using too much memory.
The replica uses temporary memory to cache often-requested read
operations, which can lead it to use more memory than the primary instance.
Restart the replica instance to reclaim the temporary memory space.
Replication stopped.
The maximum storage limit was reached and automatic storage
increase isn't enabled.
Edit the instance to enable automatic storage increase .
Replication lag is consistently high.
The write load is too high for the replica to handle. Replication lag
takes place when the SQL thread on a replica is unable to keep up with the
IO thread. Some kinds of queries or workloads can cause temporary or
permanent high replication lag for a given schema. Some of the typical
causes of replication lag are:
Slow queries on the replica. Find and fix them.
All tables must have a unique/primary key. Every update on such a
table without a unique/primary key causes full table scans on th
replica.
Queries like DELETE ... WHERE field < 50000000 cause
replication lag with row-based replication since a huge number of
updates are piled up on the replica.
Some possible solutions include:
Edit the instance to increase the size of the replica.
Reduce the load on the database.
Send read traffic to the read replica.
Index the tables.
Identify and fix slow write queries.
Recreate the replica.
Errors when rebuilding indexes in PostgreSQL 9.6.
You get an error from PostgreSQL informing you that you need to rebuild a
particular index. This can be done only on the primary instance. If you
create a new replica instance, you soon get the same error again.
Hash indexes
are not propagated to replicas in PostgreSQL versions below 10.
If you must use hash indexes, upgrade to PostgreSQL 10+. Otherwise,
if you also want to use replicas, don't use hash indexes in PostgreSQL 9.6.
Query on the primary instance is always running.
After creating a replica, the query SELECT * from pg_stat_activity where state = 'active' and pid = XXXX and username = 'cloudsqlreplica' is expected to run continuously on your primary instance.
Replica creation fails with timeout.
Long-running uncommitted transactions on the primary instance can cause
read replica creation to fail.
Recreate the replica after stopping all running queries.
If the primary instance and the replica have different vCPU sizes , then there might be query performance issues because the query optimizer takes vCPU sizes into account.
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps:
Turn on the log_duration flag and set the log_statement parameter to ddl . This provides you with both the queries and the run time on the database. However, depending on your workload, this might cause performance issues.
On both the primary instance and the read replica, run explain analyze for the queries.
Compare the query plan and check for differences.
If this is a specific query, then modify the query. For example, you can change the order of the joins to see if you get better performance.
