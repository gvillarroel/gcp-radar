This page describes how to enable and use Cloud SQL built-in authentication.
For an overview, see Cloud SQL built-in database authentication .
Before creating users
Create a Cloud SQL instance. For more information, see
Create instances .
Enable password policies for the instance. For more information, see Instance password policies .
If you plan to use your database's administrative client to manage users,
then do the following:
Connect the client to your instance.
See Connection options for external applications .
Configure the default user on the instance by setting the password.
See Set the password for the default user account .
Set the password for the default user account
When you create a new Cloud SQL instance, you must set a password for the
default user account before you can connect to the instance.
For Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, the default user is postgres .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Select Users from the SQL navigation menu.
Find the postgres user and select Change password
from the more actions menu .
Provide a strong password that you can remember and
click OK .
gcloud
Use the
gcloud sql users set-password command as follows to set the password for the default user.
Replace INSTANCE_NAME with the name of the instance before running
the command.
gcloud sql users set-password postgres \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--prompt-for-password
REST v1
To update the password for the default user account, use a PUT request with the
users:update method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
project-id : Your project ID
instance-id : The desired instance ID
user-id : The ID of the user
password : The password for the user
HTTP method and URL:
PUT https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id /users?name= user-id
Request JSON body:
{
"name": " user-id ",
"password": " password "
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X PUT \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id /users?name= user-id "

}
Create a user
After setting up the default user account , you can create other users.
When you create a built-in user, you can assign the user with
one or more database roles.
To assign a custom database role to a user, you
must create the role in the PostgreSQL database first.
To create a role in PostgreSQL, see Database roles .
Console
Note : You can't assign
database roles to PostgreSQL users by using the
Google Cloud console. To assign a database role or roles to a
PostgreSQL user, use the gcloud CLI or the Cloud SQL Admin API instead.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Select Users from the SQL navigation menu.
Click Add user account .
In the Add a user account to instance instance_name page,
you can choose whether the user authenticates with the built-in database
method (username and password) or as an
IAM user .
Select Built-in authentication (the default) and add the
following information:
A User name .
Optional. A Password . Provide a strong password that you can remember.
Click Add .
If you create a PostgreSQL user that uses built-in authentication, then the user is granted
the cloudsqlsuperuser role automatically. The user is provided with the
following privileges associated with this role: CREATEROLE ,
CREATEDB , and LOGIN .
If you want to change the privileges for the user, then you can create and
assign one or more custom PostgreSQL database roles
when you create the user in Cloud SQL. If you assign one or more custom database roles when
you create the user in Cloud SQL, then the user isn't granted the
cloudsqlsuperuser role.
If you need to change the attributes for these users, then use the
ALTER ROLE
command in the psql client. Not all attributes can be
modified with ALTER ROLE . Exceptions include the
NOSUPERUSER and NOREPLICATION roles.
For more information about these user accounts and privileges,
see
Other PostgreSQL user accounts .
gcloud
To create a user, use the
gcloud sql users create command.
Replace the following:
USER_NAME : the user name.
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance.
PASSWORD : the password for the user.
ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 ..., ROLE_ N :
optional. The database role or roles to assign to the user.
gcloud sql users create USER_NAME \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--password = PASSWORD \
--database-roles = ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 , ..., ROLE_ N
If you create a PostgreSQL user that uses built-in authentication, then the user is granted
the cloudsqlsuperuser role automatically. The user is provided with the
following privileges associated with this role: CREATEROLE ,
CREATEDB , and LOGIN .
If you want to change the privileges for the user, then you can create and
assign one or more custom PostgreSQL database roles
when you create the user in Cloud SQL. If you assign one or more custom database roles when
you create the user in Cloud SQL, then the user isn't granted the
cloudsqlsuperuser role.
If you need to change the attributes for these users, then use the
ALTER ROLE
command in the psql client. Not all attributes can be
modified with ALTER ROLE . Exceptions include the
NOSUPERUSER and NOREPLICATION roles.
For more information about these user accounts and privileges,
see
Other PostgreSQL user accounts .
Username length limits are the same for Cloud SQL as for
on-premises PostgreSQL.
When you create a user, you can add user password policy parameters.
Terraform
To create a user, use a Terraform resource .
resource "random_password" "pwd" {
length = 16
special = false
}
resource "google_sql_user" "user" {
name = "user"
instance = google_sql_database_instance.default.name
password = random_password.pwd.result
}
You can also create a user and assign database roles.
resource "google_sql_user" "builtin_user" {
name = "test-user1"
password = "password"
instance = google_sql_database_instance.default.name
# Specify the list of database roles to be granted to the user
# The database roles must exist in the database.
database_roles = ["cloudsqlsuperuser"]
}
Apply the changes
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module ).
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension—for example main.tf . In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete!" message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Delete the changes
To delete your changes, do the following:
To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the
deletion_protection argument to false .
deletion_protection = "false"
Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and
entering yes at the prompt:
terraform apply
Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following
command and entering yes at the prompt:
terraform destroy

ATTRIBUTE1
ATTRIBUTE2 ...;
Enter the password when prompted.
For more information about role attributes, see the
PostgreSQL documentation .
NOTE: When using EXTENSION
pg_stat_statements , SQL statements from all users are
visible to users with the cloudsqlsuperuser ROLE (in PostgreSQL version
10 and higher). Don't use plain text passwords in queries.
You can confirm the user creation by displaying the user table:
SELECT * FROM pg_roles ;
Set a user password policy
You can set a password policy with the
built-in authentication type.
Note: Password policies don't apply to encrypted passwords. If you set user password policies, and you want to deactivate the password policy for the instance , then you must first remove all user password policies.
gcloud
To set the user password policy, use the
gcloud sql users set-password-policy command.
Replace the following:

INSTANCE_NAME : The name of the instance.
HOST : The user's host name as a specific IP address, address
range, or any host ( % ).
PASSWORD_POLICY_ALLOWED_FAILED_ATTEMPTS : Optional: The number of
times that a user can try the password incorrectly before the account is
locked. Use --password-policy-enable-failed-attempts-check to
enable and --no-password-policy-enable-failed-attempts-check to
disable the check.
PASSWORD_POLICY_PASSWORD_EXPIRATION_DURATION : Optional:

psql Client
At the psql prompt, list the PostgreSQL users:
SELECT * FROM pg_roles ;
Note: You can't use the Google Cloud console or
gcloud to display system users.
Add database roles to an existing user
After you create a built-in user, you can assign additional roles to the user.
These roles are added to their existing roles and don't replace the existing
set of roles assigned to user account.
Before you can assign a role to a user in Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, the role
must already exist. If you're using a custom role, then you
must create the role in the PostgreSQL database first.
To create a role in PostgreSQL, see Database roles .
You can't assign any of the predefined system roles listed in
Cloud SQL system roles and users
to existing PostgreSQL users, except for the cloudsqlsuperuser .
gcloud
To assign roles to a user, use the
gcloud sql users assign-roles command.
gcloud sql users assign-roles USER_NAME \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--type = BUILT_IN \
--database-roles = ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 , ..., ROLE_ N
Replace the following:
USER_NAME : the username.
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance.
ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 , ..., ROLE_ N :
the database role or roles to assign to the user.

Replace database roles for an existing user
If you want to replace or remove database roles from the user,
you must revoke all of their existing roles while specifying new
database roles, if any.
By default, when you create a built-in PostgreSQL user, the user is
granted the cloudsqlsuperuser role automatically. If you don't want a user
to keep the cloudsqlsuperuser role, then revoke the existing roles of the user.
gcloud
To replace the database roles for a user, you revoke the existing roles
for the user and assign new roles. To replace database roles for a user,
use the following
gcloud sql users assign-roles command.
gcloud sql users assign-roles USER_NAME \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--database-roles = ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 \
--revoke-existing-roles
Replace the following:
USER_NAME : the username.
HOST : the user's host name as a specific IP address, address
range, or any host ( % ).
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance.
ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 :
the new database role or roles to assign to the user.
You can also revoke the existing roles for a user and assign zero roles.
For example:
gcloud sql users assign-roles USER_NAME \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--database-roles = \
--revoke-existing-roles
