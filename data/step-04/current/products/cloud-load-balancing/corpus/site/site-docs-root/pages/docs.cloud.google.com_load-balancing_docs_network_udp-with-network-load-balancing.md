This document discusses how to work with
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers
by using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The document is intended for app
developers, app operators, and network administrators.
About UDP
UDP is used commonly in apps. The protocol, which is described in
RFC-768 , implements a stateless, unreliable datagram packet service.
For example, Google's
QUIC
protocol improves the user experience by using UDP to speed up stream-based
apps.
The stateless part of UDP means that the transport layer doesn't maintain a
state. Therefore, each packet in a UDP "connection" is independent. In fact,
there is no real connection in UDP. Instead, its participants usually use a
2-tuple ( ip:port ) or a 4-tuple ( src-ip:src-port , dest-ip:dest-port ) to
recognize each other.
Like TCP-based apps, UDP-based apps can also benefit from a load balancer,
which is why regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers are used in UDP scenarios.
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers are passthrough load balancers; they
process incoming packets and deliver them to backend servers with the packets
intact. The backend servers then send the returning packets directly to the
clients. This technique is called Direct Server Return (DSR). On each Linux
virtual machine (VM) running on Compute Engine that is a backend of a
Google Cloud regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer, an entry in the local routing table routes
traffic that's destined for the load balancer's IP address to the network
interface controller (NIC). The following example demonstrates this technique:
root@backend-server:~# ip ro ls table local
local 10 .128.0.2 dev eth0 proto kernel scope host src 10 .128.0.2
broadcast 10 .128.0.2 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10 .128.0.2
local 198 .51.100.2 dev eth0 proto 66 scope host
broadcast 127 .0.0.0 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 127 .0.0.1
local 127 .0.0.0/8 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127 .0.0.1
local 127 .0.0.1 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127 .0.0.1
broadcast 127 .255.255.255 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 127 .0.0.1
In the preceding example, 198.51.100.2 is the load balancer's IP address. The
google-network-daemon.service agent is responsible for adding this entry.
However, as the following example shows, the VM does not actually have an
interface that owns the load balancer's IP address:
root@backend-server:~# ip ad ls
1 : lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
link/loopback 00 :00:00:00:00:00 brd 00 :00:00:00:00:00
inet 127 .0.0.1/8 scope host lo
valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet6 ::1/128 scope host
valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2 : eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1460 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
link/ether 42 :01:0a:80:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
inet 10 .128.0.2/32 brd 10 .128.0.2 scope global eth0
valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet6 fe80::4001:aff:fe80:2/64 scope link
valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
The regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer transmits the incoming packets, with the destination
address untouched, to the backend server. The local routing table entry routes
the packet to the correct app process, and the response packets from the app are
sent directly to the client.
The following diagram shows how regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers work. The
incoming packets are processed by a load balancer called
Maglev ,
which distributes the packets to the backend servers. Outgoing packets are then
sent directly to the clients through DSR.
An issue with UDP return packets
When you work with DSR, there is a slight difference between how the Linux
kernel treats TCP and UDP connections. Because TCP is a stateful protocol, the
kernel has all the information it needs about the TCP connection, including the
client address, client port, server address, and server port. This information
is recorded in the socket data structure that represents the connection. Thus,
each returning packet of a TCP connection has the source address correctly set
to the server address. For a load balancer, that address is the load balancer's
IP address.
Recall that UDP is stateless, however, so the socket objects that are created
in the app process for UDP connections don't have the connection information.
The kernel doesn't have the information about the source address of an outgoing
packet, and it doesn't know the relation to a previously received packet. For
the packet's source address, the kernel can only fill in the address of the
interface that the returning UDP packet goes to. Or if the app previously bound
the socket to a certain address, the kernel uses that address as the source
address.
The following code shows a simple echo program:
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket , struct
def loop_on_socket ( s ):
while True :
d , addr = s . recvfrom ( 1500 )
print ( d , addr )
s . sendto ( "ECHO: " . encode ( 'utf8' ) + d , addr )
if __name__ == "__main__" :
HOST , PORT = "0.0.0.0" , 60002
sock = socket . socket ( type = socket . SocketKind . SOCK_DGRAM )
sock . bind (( HOST , PORT ))
loop_on_socket ( sock )
Following is the tcpdump output during a UDP conversation:
14:50:04.758029 IP 203.0.113.2.40695 > 198.51.100.2.60002: UDP, length 3
14:50:04.758396 IP 10.128.0.2.60002 > 203.0.113.2.40695: UDP, length 2T
198.51.100.2 is the load balancer's IP address, and 203.0.113.2 is the
client IP address.
After the packets leave the VM, another NAT device–a Compute Engine
gateway–in the Google Cloud network translates the source address to the
external address. The gateway doesn't know which external address should be
used, so only the VM's external address (not the load balancer's) can be used.
From the client side, if you check the output from tcpdump , the packets from
the server look like the following:
23:05:37.072787 IP 203.0.113.2.40695 > 198.51.100.2.60002: UDP, length 5
23:05:37.344148 IP 198.51.100.3.60002 > 203.0.113.2.40695: UDP, length 4
198.51.100.3 is the VM's external IP address.
From the client's point of view, the UDP packets are not coming from an address
that the client sent them to. This causes problems: the kernel drops these
packets, and if the client is behind a NAT device, so does the NAT device. As a
result, the client app gets no response from the server. The following diagram
shows this process where the client rejects returning packets because of address
mismatches.
Solving the UDP problem
To solve the no-response problem, you must rewrite the source address of
outgoing packets to the load balancer's IP address at the server that's hosting
the app. Following are several options that you can use to accomplish this
header rewrite. The first solution uses a Linux-based approach with iptables ;
the other solutions take app-based approaches.
Note: The last two examples in this document are written in Python 3 but can be
written in most programming languages.
The following diagram shows the core idea of these options: rewrite the
source IP address of the returning packets in order to match the load balancer's
IP address.
Use NAT policy in the backend server
The NAT policy solution is to use the Linux iptables command to rewrite the
destination address from the load balancer's IP address to the VM's IP address.
In the following example, you add an iptables DNAT rule to change the
destination address of the incoming packets:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j RETURN -d 10 .128.0.2 -p udp --dport 60002
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -j DNAT --to-destination 10 .128.0.2 -d 198 .51.100.2 -p udp --dport 60002
This command adds two rules to the NAT table of the iptables system. The
first rule bypasses all incoming packets that target the local eth0 address.
As a result, traffic that doesn't come from the load balancer isn't affected.
The second rule changes the destination IP address of incoming packets to the
VM's internal IP address. The DNAT rules are stateful, which means that the
kernel tracks the connections and rewrites the returning packets' source address
automatically.
Pros
Cons
The kernel translates the address, with no change required to
apps.
Extra CPU is used to do the NAT. And because DNAT is stateful,
memory consumption might also be high.
Supports multiple load balancers.
Use nftables to statelessly mangle the IP header fields
In the nftables solution, you use the nftables command to mangle the source
address in the IP header of outgoing packets. This mangling is stateless, so it
consumes fewer resources than using DNAT. To use nftables , you need a Linux
kernel version greater than 4.10.
You use the following commands:
nft add table raw
nft add chain raw postrouting { type filter hook postrouting priority 300 )
nft add rule raw postrouting ip saddr 10 .128.0.2 udp sport 60002 ip saddr set 198 .51.100.2
Pros
Cons
The kernel translates the address, with no change required to
apps.
Does not support multiple load balancers.
The address translation process is stateless, so resource
consumption is much lower.
Extra CPU is used to do the NAT.
nftables are available only to newer Linux kernel
versions. Some distros, like Centos 7.x, cannot use
nftables .
Let the app explicitly bind to the load balancer's IP address
In the binding solution, you modify your app so that it binds explicitly to the
load balancer's IP address. For a UDP socket, the bind operation lets the
kernel know which address to use as the source address when sending UDP packets
that use that socket.
The following example shows how to bind to a specific address in Python:
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket
def loop_on_socket ( s ):
while True :
d , addr = s . recvfrom ( 1500 )
print ( d , addr )
s . sendto ( "ECHO: " . encode ( 'utf8' ) + d , addr )
if __name__ == "__main__" :
# Instead of setting HOST to "0.0.0.0",
# we set HOST to the Load Balancer IP
HOST , PORT = "198.51.100.2" , 60002
sock = socket . socket ( type = socket . SocketKind . SOCK_DGRAM )
sock . bind (( HOST , PORT ))
loop_on_socket ( sock )
# 198.51.100.2 is the load balancer's IP address
# You can also use the DNS name of the load balancer's IP address
The preceding code is a UDP server; it echoes back the bytes received, with a
preceding "ECHO: " . Pay attention to lines 12 and 13, where the server
is bound to the address 198.51.100.2 , which is the load balancer's IP address.
Pros
Cons
Can be achieved with a simple code change to the app.
Does not support multiple load balancers.
Use recvmsg / sendmsg instead of recvfrom / sendto to specify the address
In this solution, you use recvmsg / sendmsg calls instead of
recvfrom / sendto calls. In comparison to recvfrom / sendto calls, the
recvmsg / sendmsg calls can handle ancillary control messages along with the
payload data. These ancillary control messages include the source or destination
address of the packets. This solution lets you fetch destination addresses from
incoming packets, and because those addresses are real load balancer
addresses, you can use them as source addresses when sending replies.
The following example program demonstrates this solution:
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket , struct
def loop_on_socket ( s ):
while True :
d , ctl , flg , addr = s . recvmsg ( 1500 , 1024 )
# ctl contains the destination address information
s . sendmsg ([ "ECHO: " . encode ( "utf8" ), d ], ctl , 0 , addr )
if __name__ == "__main__" :
HOST , PORT = "0.0.0.0" , 60002
s = socket . socket ( type = socket . SocketKind . SOCK_DGRAM )
s . setsockopt ( 0 , # level is 0 (IPPROTO_IP)
8 , # optname is 8 (IP_PKTINFO)
1 )
s . bind (( HOST , PORT ))
loop_on_socket ( s )
This program demonstrates how to use recvmsg / sendmsg calls. In order to
fetch address information from packets, you must use the setsockopt call to
set the IP_PKTINFO option.
Pros
Cons
Works even if there are multiple load balancers–for example, when
there are both internal and external load balancers configured to the
same backend.
Requires you to make complex changes to the app. In some cases,
this might not be possible.
