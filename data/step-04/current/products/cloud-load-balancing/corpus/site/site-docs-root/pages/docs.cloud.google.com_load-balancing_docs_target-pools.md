Using target pools
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A target pool is a group of backend instances that receive incoming traffic from
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers. All backend instances of a target pool must reside in the same
Google Cloud region. Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers can
use either a backend service or a target pool to define the group of backend
instances. If you're creating new regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers, we recommend using backend
services .
This page describes configuration options for target pool backends. When a
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer's forwarding rule directs traffic to a target pool, the load
balancer chooses an instance from the target pool based on a
hash of the
source IP address, the source port, the destination IP address, and the
destination port.
If you intend your target pool to contain a single virtual machine (VM),
consider using the protocol
forwarding feature instead of load
balancing.
Note: This page describes how to configure a specific load balancer component or
feature before or after you've already created a load balancer. Working with
specific components is useful for advanced configurations and necessary for some
configuration options. Before using the information on this page, know the type
of Google Cloud load balancer
that you need.
Target pool properties
Target pools work with forwarding rules that handle TCP and UDP
traffic. You must create a target pool before you can use it with a forwarding
rule.
Target pools use legacy HTTP health
checks .
A target pool is made up of the following properties:
name
The name of this target pool. The name must be unique in this
project, from 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression:
[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? , which means the first character must be a
lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase
letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
description
Optional. A user-defined description of this target pool.
region
The fully qualified URL of the target pool's region. The region
should be the same region where your backend instances reside. For example:
"region" : "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION "
healthChecks[ ]
Optional. An optional list of health checks for this target pool. Only one
health check can be attached to a particular target pool. See Health
checking for more information.
instances[ ]
A list of instance URLs that should handle traffic for this target
pool. All instances must reside in the same region as the target pool, but
instances can belong to different zones within a single region. For example:
"instances" : [
"https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE ",
"https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE-2 "
]
sessionAffinity
Optional. Controls the method used to select a backend virtual machine
instance. You can only set this value during the creation of the target pool.
Once set, you cannot modify this value. The hash method selects a backend based
on a subset of the following 5 values:
Source / Destination IP
Source / Destination Port
Layer 4 Protocol (TCP, UDP)
Possible hashes are:
NONE (i.e., no hash specified) (default)
5-tuple hashing, which uses the source and destination IPs, source
and destination ports, and protocol. Each new connection can end up on
any instance, but all traffic for a given connection will stay on the
same instance, if the instance stays healthy.
CLIENT_IP_PROTO
3-tuple hashing, which uses the source and destination IPs
and the protocol. All connections from a client will end up on
the same instance as long as they use the same protocol
and the instance stays healthy.
CLIENT_IP
2-tuple hashing, which uses the source and destination IPs. All
connections from a client will end up on the same instance
regardless of protocol as long as the instance stays healthy.
5-tuple hashing provides a good distribution of traffic across many
virtual machines. However, a second session from the same client may
arrive on a different instance because the source port may change. If you
want all sessions from the same client to reach the same backend, as long
as the backend stays healthy, you can specify CLIENT_IP_PROTO or
CLIENT_IP options.
In general, if you select a 3-tuple or 2-tuple method, it will provide for
better session affinity than the default 5-tuple method, but the overall
traffic may not be as evenly distributed.
Fragmented UDP packets : If you are load balancing UDP traffic that is
likely to be fragmented, set session affinity to CLIENT_IP_PROTO
or CLIENT_IP . Don't use NONE (5-tuple hashing). This is because
UDP fragments other than the first one don't carry the port number,
and the load balancer may drop the fragments without the port. See
Load balancing and fragmented UDP
packets
for more information.
Caution: If a large percentage of
your clients are behind a proxy server, don't
use CLIENT_IP_PROTO or CLIENT_IP .
Using them sends all traffic from those clients to the same instance.
backupPool
Optional. A fully qualified URL to another target pool resource. A backup
pool is a target pool that another target pool references. You
must also define failoverRatio to use this feature. If
the ratio of healthy virtual machines in your target pool falls
below the failoverRatio , the regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer sends traffic to your backup
pool. You can only provide one backup pool per target pool. The
backup pool must be in the same region as the target pool. If the
ratio of healthy instances in your target pool falls below your
configured failover ratio, the regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer uses the following rules to
route your traffic:
If the ratio of healthy instances to total instances in the target pool
is less than the failover ratio, traffic is sent to healthy instances
in the backup pool.
If the ratio of healthy instances to total instances in the target pool
is less than the failover ratio but there are no
remaining healthy instances in the backup pool, traffic is sent to the
remaining healthy instances in the target pool.
If the target pool is not empty and if all instances in both the target
pool and the backup pool fail their health checks, traffic is sent to
all instances in the target pool, as a last resort.
If the target pool is empty and if all instances in the backup pool
fail their health checks, traffic is sent to all instances in the
backup pool, as a last resort.
Only one level of failover is supported. For example, if target
pool A has backup pool B, and backup pool B has backup pool C, then traffic
intended for target pool A can only be directed to backup pool B and not
to backup pool C.
failoverRatio
Optional. A float between 0.0 and 1.0 , which determines when this
target pool is declared unhealthy. For example, if this value is set to 0.1 ,
then this target pool is declared unhealthy if the number of healthy instances
are less than 0.1 (10%). If the failover ratio is 0.0 , then at least one
backend must be healthy for the pool to be considered healthy. If the
failover ratio is set to 1.0 , then all instances must be healthy for the
pool to be considered healthy. You must define this if you define the
backupPool field.
Failover conditions
Conditions
New connections go to
Failover ratio !=0, healthy VMs in target pool >= FR
target pool
Failover ratio =0, healthy VMs in target pool > 0
target pool
Failover ratio !=0, healthy VMs in target pool < FR, and
at least one VM in the backup pool is healthy
backup pool
Failover ratio =0, healthy VMs in target pool = 0, and
at least one VM in the backup pool is healthy
backup pool
At least one VM is in the target pool, and all VMs in the target pool are
unhealthy, and all VMs in the backup pool are unhealthy
target pool (last resort)
No VMs are in the target pool, and all VMs in the backup pool are
unhealthy
backup pool (last resort)
No VMs are in the target pool, and no VMs are in the backup pool
Traffic is dropped
Create a target pool
Console
Target pools can't be created in the Google Cloud console.
You can create a target pool by using the Google Cloud CLI or the API.
To learn how to create a target pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer by using the
Google Cloud CLI, see Set up a regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer with a target
pool .
gcloud
To use gcloud compute to create a target pool, use the target-pools
create command :
gcloud compute target-pools create TARGET_POOL \
[--backup-pool= BACKUP_POOL ] \
[--description= DESCRIPTION ] \
[--failover-ratio= FAILOVER_RATIO ] \
[--http-health-check= HEALTH_CHECK ] \
[--region= REGION ]
[--session-affinity= SESSION_AFFINITY ; default="NONE"]
Replace the following:
TARGET_POOL : a name for the target pool
BACKUP_POOL : a name for the backup target pool
DESCRIPTION : a description of the target pool
FAILOVER_RATIO : a value between 0.0 and 1.0,
which determines when the target pool is declared unhealthy
HEALTH_CHECK : a health check for this target pool
REGION : a region of the target pool
SESSION_AFFINITY : the method
used to select a backend virtual machine instance
API
To create a target pool in the API, make a HTTP POST request to
the following URI:
https://www.googleapis.com/v1/compute/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /targetPools
{
"name": name,
"instances": [
"https://www.googleapis.com/v1/compute/project/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE ",
"https://www.googleapis.com/v1/compute/project/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE-2 ",
]
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID
ZONE : the zone that the target pool's instances
are in
INSTANCE , INSTANCE-2 : the
instances to be added to the target pool
Add or remove an instance from a target pool
Console
Target pools can't be edited in the Google Cloud console.
You can edit a target pool by using the Google Cloud CLI or the API.
gcloud
To use gcloud compute to add instances to a target pool, use the
target-pools add-instances command :
gcloud compute target-pools add-instances TARGET_POOL \
--instances= INSTANCE ,[ INSTANCE-2 ,...]
Replace the following:
TARGET_POOL : the name of the target pool
INSTANCE , INSTANCE-2 :

--instances= INSTANCE ,[ INSTANCE-2 ,...]
Replace the following:
TARGET_POOL : the name of the target pool
INSTANCE , INSTANCE-2 :
the name of the instance (or instances) to be removed from the target pool
Note: Removing an instance from a target pool without draining it first breaks

drain the instance by making it fail its
health check . After TCP sessions
close, remove the instance from the pool.
API

Get the health status of instances
Console
To get the health status of instances in a target pool, use the load balancing
advanced menu.
On the Advanced load balancing page, go to the Target pools tab.
Go to Target pools
Click the name of the target pool.
The Target pool details page lists all the instances and their health
status.
gcloud
To use gcloud compute to check the current health status of an instance
in your target pool or of all instances in the target pool, you can use the
gcloud compute target-pools get-health command :
gcloud compute target-pools get-health TARGET_POOL
Replace TARGET_POOL with the name of the target
pool.
The command returns the health status as determined by the configured
health check, either healthy or unhealthy.

to be deleted.
API
In the API, send an empty DELETE request to the following URI:
https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /targetPools/ TARGET_POOL
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID
TARGET_POOL : the name of the target pool to be
updated
REGION : the region that the target pool is in
Add or remove a health check from a target pool
Health check objects are standalone, global resources that can be associated or disassociated
from any target pool.
If a target pool has no associated health check, the regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer
will treat all instances as healthy and send traffic to all instances in the
target pool. However, if you query for the health status of a target pool
without a health check, the status will return as unhealthy to indicate that
the target pool does not have a health check. We recommend that your target
pools should have associated health checks to help you manage your instances.
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers use legacy HTTP health
checks to
determine the health of instances in the target pool. A regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer can
only use a legacy HTTP health check, not a legacy HTTPS health check.
Console
When using the Google Cloud console, you can create a legacy HTTP
health check while creating a regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer with a target pool
backend .
You cannot use the Google Cloud console Health checks page to create
a standalone legacy health check.
gcloud
To use gcloud compute to add a health check to a target pool, use the
target-pools add-health-checks command :
gcloud compute target-pools add-health-checks TARGET_POOL \
--http-health-check= HEALTH_CHECK
Replace the following:
TARGET_POOL : the name of the target pool
HEALTH_CHECK : the legacy HTTP health
check to be used with this target pool
To remove a health check, use the
target-pools remove-health-checks command :
gcloud compute target-pools remove-health-checks TARGET_POOL \
--http-health-check= HEALTH_CHECK
Replace the following:
TARGET_POOL : the name of the target pool
HEALTH_CHECK : the legacy HTTP health check to be
removed from this target pool
API
To associate or disassociate a health check using the API, make a HTTP POST
request to the appropriate URIs:
https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /targetPools/ TARGET_POOL /removeHealthCheck
https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /targetPools/ TARGET_POOL /addHealthCheck
The body of your request should contain the health check to associate or
disassociate:
{
"healthCheck": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/httpHealthChecks/ HEALTH_CHECK "
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID
TARGET_POOL : the name of the target pool to be
updated
REGION : the region that the target pool is in
HEALTH_CHECK : the legacy HTTP health check to be
associated or disassociated with the target pool
For more information, see the API reference documentation for
targetPools.addHealthCheck
and
targetPools.removeHealthCheck .
Add or remove a backup target pool
When you first create a target pool, you can choose to apply a backup target
pool that receives traffic if your target pool becomes unhealthy.
If you have never set up a backup target pool before, you should also set up
health checks for the feature to work
correctly.
Note: If your target pool has the
sessionAffinity field set, resizing the target pool could
cause requests that come from the same IP to go to a different instance
initially. Eventually, all connections from the IP will go to the same virtual
machine, as the old connections close.
Console
Target pools can't be edited in the Google Cloud console.
You can edit a target proxy by using the Google Cloud CLI or the API.
gcloud
To use gcloud compute to update the backup pool resource, use the
target-pools set-backup command :
gcloud compute target-pools set-backup TARGET_POOL \
--backup-pool= BACKUP_POOL \
--failover-ratio= FAILOVER_RATIO
Replace the following:
TARGET_POOL : the name of the target pool
BACKUP_POOL : a name for the backup target pool
FAILOVER_RATIO : a value between 0.0 and 1.0,
which determines when the target pool is declared unhealthy
API
To make a request to update or remove a backup pool through the API, send a
POST request to the following URI:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /targetPools/ TARGET_POOL /setBackup?failoverRatio= FAILOVER_RATIO
{
"target": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /targetPools/ BACKUP_POOL "
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID
TARGET_POOL : the name of the target pool to be
updated
REGION : the region that the target pool is in
BACKUP_POOL : the name of the backup pool to be
associated with the target pool
FAILOVER_RATIO : the failover ratio
If you define an empty target or don't define a failover ratio, the backup
pool behavior is disabled for this target pool.
