Network endpoint groups overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A network endpoint group (NEG) is a configuration object that specifies a group
of backend endpoints or services. With NEGs,
Google Cloud load balancers can serve virtual machine (VM) instance group-based
workloads, serverless workloads, and containerized workloads. NEGs let you distribute traffic to your
load balancer's backends at a more granular level (for example, load balancing
traffic at the Pod
level
instead of at the VM-level for GKE workloads).
You can configure NEGs as backends for
your load balancers. Certain NEG types can also be used with Cloud Service Mesh.
Use the following tables to decide which type of NEG you need for your
deployment.
Zonal NEG
Internet NEG
Serverless NEG
Hybrid connectivity NEG
Private Service Connect NEG
Port mapping NEG
Zonal NEG
Features
Details
Purpose
One or more
internal IP
address endpoints that resolve to either Compute Engine VM
instances or GKE Pods.
For detailed information about this NEG and its use cases, see
Zonal
NEGs overview .
NetworkEndpointType API name
GCE_VM_IP
IP only: resolves to the primary internal IPv4 address of a
VM's network interface
OR
GCE_VM_IP_PORT
IP:Port: resolves to either the primary internal IPv4 address of a
VM's network interface or an internal IPv4 address from an alias IP
address range associated with a VM's network interface; for
example, Pod IPv4 addresses in
VPC-native
clusters .
Only GCE_VM_IP_PORT type endpoints support IPv4 and
IPv6 (dual stack) zonal NEGs.

1 or more
Health checks for NEGs attached to backend
services
