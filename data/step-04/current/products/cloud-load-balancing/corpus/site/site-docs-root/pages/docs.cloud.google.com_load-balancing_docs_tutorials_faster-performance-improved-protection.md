Faster web performance and improved web protection for load balancing
Stay organized with collections

This tutorial outlines the value of adding Cloud CDN and Google Cloud Armor
to an existing external Application Load Balancer deployment. It includes basic instructions for
enabling both Cloud CDN and Cloud Armor with an
external Application Load Balancer.
Note: If you are using Cloud Armor with Cloud CDN, security
policies are enforced only for requests for dynamic content, cache misses, or
other requests that are destined for your origin server. Security policies do
not apply to cache hits, even if the connecting client would otherwise match a
rule in the policy.
Improving web performance with Cloud CDN
Using the external Application Load Balancer already improves web performance by
setting up HTTP(S) connections on Google's global edge closer to the
requesting client and by negotiating connections using modern protocols such as
QUIC, HTTP/2, and TLS
1.3
to reduce the number of round trips and enhance throughput. Further, by using
persistent connections to your origin, Google Cloud reduces the overhead
of each client connection. Google's edge locations are connected to our global
private backbone network, which allows Google Cloud to optimize routing
and reduce latency between the client, Google's edge, and your backends. You can
further improve performance and reduce your serving costs by enabling
Cloud CDN as part of your external Application Load Balancer deployment.
What is Cloud CDN?
Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network) uses Google's globally distributed
edge points of presence to cache copies of load balanced content close to your
users.
How Cloud CDN can improve web performance
There are multiple ways that Cloud CDN improves performance.
Offloads and scales your backend infrastructure by reducing requests
A request served from the Cloud CDN cache means that the load balancer
doesn't need to send the request
to backend infrastructure for a static element such as an image, video,
JavaScript, or stylesheet. This not only reduces load during normal operation but
allows Google edge infrastructure to absorb spikes in requests without
increasing the load on your backend serving infrastructure. This ensures backend
infrastructure is focused on generating user-specific responses such as dynamic
HTML for interactive web experiences.
Serves static assets from the edge
Because Google's global edge sends cached requests, the
response times to client requests can be reduced. Static elements of your web
experience such as images, videos, JavaScript, and stylesheets can be delivered
right away without needing to forward the request to the backend systems and
wait for a response and data transfer.
Reduces your data transfer and backend infrastructure costs
By using Cloud CDN with your external Application Load Balancer, you reduce your
backend infrastructure costs due to reduced traffic to the backend.
Additionally, you can reduce the number of cycles to deliver static content
because it is sent from the Google edge. Cloud CDN traffic is billed at
a lower data transfer cost , further controlling costs.
Enabling Cloud CDN for your external Application Load Balancer
You can enable Cloud CDN for an existing external Application Load Balancer or when
setting up a new load balancer.
Enabling Cloud CDN during external Application Load Balancer setup
During backend configuration, select the Enable Cloud CDN checkbox. For
details, see the Cloud CDN how-to guides .
Enabling Cloud CDN for an existing external Application Load Balancer
In an existing external Application Load Balancer configuration, in the Load Balancer details
screen, you can click Edit edit to
modify your load balancer.
Then, in the Backend Configuration section, you can select the
Enable Cloud CDN checkbox. For detailed instructions, including
gcloud commands, see the Cloud CDN how-to
guides .
Improving web protection with Cloud Armor
Using the external Application Load Balancer already provides a measure of web protection by
setting up HTTP(S) connections on Google's global edge, offloading your backend
infrastructure from needing to handle this process. By enabling
Cloud Armor as part of your external Application Load Balancer you have increased
visibility and control against infrastructure and application attacks.
Note: You can use Cloud Armor with Cloud CDN to protect the
CDN origin servers. Cloud Armor ensures that the CDN origin server is
protected from application attacks, mitigates OWASP Top 10 risks, and
enforces Layer 7 filtering policies. Cloud Armor enforces security
policies for backend services with Cloud CDN enabled only for
cache misses; that is, for requests that miss or bypass the Cloud CDN
cache.
What is Cloud Armor?
Cloud Armor provides DDoS and application layer defense working in
conjunction with external Application Load Balancers. It provides visibility into attacks and
allows you to deploy pre-configured and custom rules to mitigate attacks against
your web applications and services. Like the external Application Load Balancer,
Cloud Armor is delivered at the edge of Google's network, helping to
defend against infrastructure and application attacks close to their source.
How Cloud Armor can improve web protection
There are multiple ways that Cloud Armor improves protection.
Automatically blocks most volumetric DDoS attacks
Cloud Armor works with the external Application Load Balancer to automatically block
network protocol and volumetric DDoS attacks such as protocol floods (SYN, TCP,
HTTP, and ICMP) and amplification attacks (NTP, UDP, DNS). Cloud Armor
is based on technologies developed originally to defend Google's own web
services such as search, gmail, and maps.
Has pre-configured WAF rules to help detect and mitigate common application attacks
Cloud Armor provides a library of pre-configured web application
firewall (WAF) rules that help detect and optionally help mitigate common web
attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and command injection
attacks against your web infrastructure.
Detects and blocks by geographical source and IP addresses or IP ranges
Cloud Armor leverages Google's Geo-IP database to identify the
geographical region of incoming requests destined for your web infrastructure
and allows you to block traffic based on two-character country codes. For
example, an online commerce site that does not ship outside of a given country
can block requests from common sources of attack traffic. Additionally,
Cloud Armor allows quick blocking of specific IP addresses or ranges of
IP addresses making malicious requests.
Provides visibility to monitor and mitigate application layer HTTP(S) attacks
Cloud Armor also provides a custom-rules language that lets you match
complex patterns from incoming requests using a wide variety
of HTTP(S) semantics. This includes headers, cookies, URLs, query string
elements, user agent patterns, and HTTP methods.
Enabling Cloud Armor for your external Application Load Balancer
Security policies drive Cloud Armor configuration. These policies
enable built-in rules and support custom rules for protection. To deploy
Cloud Armor, you must create a security policy, add rules, and then
attach this policy to one or more external Application Load Balancer backend services.
Each rule specifies the parameters to detect in traffic, the action to
take if the traffic matches these parameters, and a priority value that
determines the position of the rule in the policy hierarchy.
Creating a Cloud Armor security policy
At a high level, these are the steps for configuring Cloud Armor
security policies to enable rules that allow or deny traffic to
external Application Load Balancer.
Create a Cloud Armor security policy in the Network Security -
Cloud Armor screen.
Add rules to the policy based on IP lists, custom expressions, or
pre-configured WAF rules such as SQL injection or Cross-site scripting.
Attach the Cloud Armor security policy to a backend service of
the external Application Load Balancer for which you want to control access.
Update the Cloud Armor security policy as needed.

Cloud Armor how-to guides .
