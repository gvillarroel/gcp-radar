March 31, 2026
Feature
SNI-based routing for proxy Network Load Balancers is now available in
Preview .
You can now route TLS traffic based on Server Name Indication (SNI) hostnames
by using the new TLSRoute resource. The load balancer inspects the
initial unencrypted ClientHello message to extract the SNI hostname and
route connections to the appropriate backend service.
This feature provides pure TLS passthrough without terminating the connection
at the load balancer. Key benefits include:
End-to-end encryption : Clients can establish secure mTLS or TLS sessions
directly with origin servers.
Role-oriented management : The TLSRoute API lets platform administrators
to manage frontend infrastructure while service owners manage their own routes
and backends independently.
Simplified IP management : Consolidate multiple services behind a single
Private Service Connect (PSC) endpoint ,
reducing IPv4 address exhaustion.
This feature is available for regional and cross-region proxy Network Load Balancers.

January 28, 2026
Feature
To enhance security and help meet stringent compliance requirements like
FedRAMP, you can now apply a FIPS-compliant SSL policy to your
Application Load Balancers and proxy Network Load Balancers. This update also introduces
the ability to enforce TLS 1.3 as the minimum protocol version.
New FIPS_202205 profile
The new FIPS_202205 profile, available as a predefined SSL policy, restricts
the load balancer to use only FIPS 140-2/140-3 validated cryptographic modules
and ciphers.
When this profile is selected, the load balancer:
Enforces strict TLS settings, negotiating connections
only using TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3.
Uses a limited set of approved cipher suites for TLS 1.2,
such as the cipher suites in ECDHE-RSA-AES-GCM
and ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-GCM families.
Excludes non-FIPS ciphers for TLS 1.3, such as TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 .
Minimum TLS 1.3 Enforcement
You can now specify TLS 1.3 as the minimum version for your SSL policy, which
must be paired with the RESTRICTED profile. If you mandate TLS 1.3 as the
minimum version, any clients attempting to connect via TLS 1.2 or lower will be
rejected. Ensure your client ecosystem supports TLS 1.3 before enforcing this
minimum TLS version.
For more information, see the following:
SSL policies overview
Use SSL policies
This feature is in General availability .
January 23, 2026
Feature
Application Load Balancers now support the configuration of a
traffic duration
setting when you add backends to the backend services. You can configure this
setting as SHORT or LONG based on the response time needed by backends to
complete HTTP requests.
Application Load Balancers also support the use of a new
in-flight balancing mode
that lets you configure the load balancer's traffic distribution to supported
backends when requests take more than a second to complete.
This feature is available in Preview .
January 19, 2026
Feature
Backend buckets are available for
regional external Application Load Balancers and regional internal Application Load Balancers.
This feature enables to serve static content (such as images, video, and CSS)
confined to a specific region, helping you meet strict data residency and
compliance requirements for regulated workloads. This update ensures backend
bucket availability across the entire Application Load Balancers portfolio.

January 16, 2026
Feature
Managed workload identity is available for backend mutual TLS (mTLS) in
global external Application Load Balancers.
This feature allows to:
Streamline certificate management : Managed workload identity enables
automated certificate and trust management for backend mTLS through seamless
integration with Certificate Authority Service and Certificate Manager.
Eliminate operational toil : Certificates are automatically rotated based
on the workload identity pool's configuration, removing the complexity and
manual bottleneck of private key provisioning and maintenance.
Improve visibility and governance : Gain visibility into communication
between distributed services and proactively apply governance to workloads
across environments.
For more information, see
Backend mTLS with managed workload identity overview
This feature is in Preview .
December 17, 2025
Security
Starting December 17, 2025 , requests with request methods that aren't
compliant with RFC 9110, Section
5.6.2 will be
rejected by a first-layer Google Front End (GFE) before reaching your load
balancer or its backends. Previously, such non-compliant requests would have
been rejected by the load balancer or its backends with a variety of error
codes. With the GFE now handling such requests, you might observe a small
decrease in error rates.
This change applies only to global external Application Load Balancers and classic Application Load Balancers.
December 03, 2025
Feature
Regular expressions matchers in host and route rules in URL maps
You can now use regular expressions to configure more flexible and precise
traffic routing rules within URL maps for Application Load Balancer. This feature
lets you leverage the power of RE2 syntax for matching on:
Route rules : Within pathMatchers , the matchRules array now supports a
regexMatch field to validate the URL path against a specified regex pattern.
Header matches : Within matchRules , the headerMatches array now
supports a regexMatch field for pattern matching against HTTP header values.
Query parameter matches : Within matchRules , the queryParameterMatches
array now supports a regexMatch field for pattern matching against HTTP
query parameters values.
This feature is available for the following load balancers:
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Cross-region internal Application Load Balancer
Regional external Application Load Balancer
For more details on usage and syntax, see URL map concepts: Regular expressions
matchers in host and route
rules .

This feature is in General availability .
October 31, 2025
Change
The global and classic external Application Load Balancers implemented on
Google Front-Ends (GFEs) now reject TLS connections when the client and the load
balancer support ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation), but don't share
common ALPN protocols.
Previously, if a client proposed a list of application protocols during the TLS
handshake using the ALPN extension and none were supported by the load balancer,
ALPN would be deactivated and the connection would default to using HTTP/1 as
the default application protocol. After this update, the GFE instead returns
an SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL response which causes the load balancer to
terminate the TLS handshake, and the connection to close. This change ensures
that an application-layer protocol is always explicitly negotiated between the
clients and the load balancers that support ALPN.
October 29, 2025
Feature
You can specify a custom ephemeral /96 IPv6 address range when creating a
regional IPv6 forwarding rule. For more information, see the following:

establish access control checks for incoming traffic.
For details, see
Authorization policy overview .
This feature is in General availability .
October 06, 2025
Feature
Percentage-based request mirroring is now supported for the global and regional external Application Load Balancers (classic is not supported). By default, the mirrored backend service receives all requests, even if the original traffic is being split between multiple weighted backend services. You
can now configure the mirrored backend service to receive only a percentage of the
requests by using the mirrorPercent flag to specify the percentage of
requests to be mirrored, expressed as a value between 0 and 100.0.
For an example, see Set up traffic management for regional external Application Load Balancers .
This feature is available in General availability .
September 17, 2025
Security
A security fix was made which changes the behavior of requests and responses sent with the Transfer-Encoding: Chunked header to be more RFC 9112 compliant. The RFC states that both the chunked_body and the last-chunk fields must end in CRLF . This is now enforced.
September 12, 2025
Change
The global and classic external Application Load Balancers implemented on Google Front-Ends (GFEs) now support HTTP/1.0 explicitly as a protocol during ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) negotiation.
Previously, when the GFEs didn't support HTTP/1.0 explicitly, the GFE would return an SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK response, disable ALPN, and fall back to using HTTP/1 (which includes HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1) as the default application protocol. After this change, GFEs will instead return HTTP/1.0 , which provides clients with positive confirmation that their advertised HTTP/1.0 was accepted.
You are not expected to make any changes with this update. If a TLS handshake with HTTP/1.0 is unsuccessful, please contact support .
August 26, 2025
Feature
The internal and external passthrough Network Load Balancers now support load balancing to unmanaged instance groups comprised of IPv6-only VM instances.
Protocol forwarding also supports IPv6-only target instances.

Feature
Cross-region internal Application Load Balancers can now route requests for static content to Cloud Storage buckets.
For more information, see Set up a cross-region internal Application Load Balancer with Cloud Storage buckets .
This capability is now in General Availability .
July 30, 2025
Change
Starting October 15, 2025, the global and classic external Application Load Balancers are improving HTTP header handling for headers with obs-fold values to comply with the RFC 9112 standard
Previously, these load balancers would forward HTTP headers with obs-fold values (those split across multiple lines, with subsequent lines starting with a space or a tab) without any changes. Starting October 15, 2025, each obs-fold will be replaced with one or more space characters (SP octets) before forwarding the message upstream. This ensures that the header is correctly interpreted as a single line, as required by the HTTP specification.
What you need to do
Review your current client applications and backend services before October 15, 2025 and ensure that they generate HTTP headers with obs-fold values in a single-line format when communicating with these load balancers.
Because the obs-fold header fields have been deprecated in RFC 9112, compliant clients and servers should already avoid using this format. However, there is a possibility that services that specifically rely on the old, non-compliant multi-line format of headers with obs-fold values might experience unexpected behavior. You should proactively check your backend service logs for any errors originating from your services due to the modified obs-fold headers.
For more information on the HTTP specification regarding headers with obs-fold values, review RFC 9112, Section 5.2: Obsolete Line Folding .
July 28, 2025
Feature
Global external Application Load Balancers now support the JA4 fingerprint . The JA4 fingerprint can be added to a custom request header using the tls_ja4_fingerprint variable.
This capability is now in General Availability .
July 09, 2025
Feature
Application Load Balancers and Proxy Network Load Balancers now support TLS certificates with large key sizes. Previously, these load balancers supported only certificates with RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256 key types. With this update, you can now use self-managed certificates with RSA-3072, RSA-4096, and ECDSA P-384 keys.
Key details :
Supported key types (for self-managed certificates): RSA-2048, RSA-3072, RSA-4096, ECDSA P-256, and ECDSA P-384
Load balancing coverage for self managed certificates:
Certificate Manager SSL certificates: Global and regional load balancing
Compute Engine SSL Certificates: Regional load balancing
Pricing: An additional charge of $0.45 per 1 million connections applies with certificates that use RSA-3072 and RSA-4096 key types. There are no per-connection charges for certificates that use RSA-2048, ECDSA P-256, or ECDSA P-384 key types.
For more information, see the documentation for Supported key types .
This capability is now in General Availability .
July 08, 2025
Feature
Zonal affinity, configured on the backend service of an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, lets you limit cross-zone traffic, reduce latency, and improve performance, all while maintaining the benefits of a multi-zonal architecture.
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancers support three zonal affinity options that offer varying degrees of preference for routing new connections to eligible backends that are in the same zone as a supported client.
For more information, see Zonal affinity for internal passthrough Network Load Balancers .
This feature is in Preview .
June 26, 2025
Feature
In typical HTTPS communication, neither the load balancer nor the backend verify each other's identity, assuming that they are within a secure perimeter and can be trusted. However, when perimeter security needs reinforcement or communication extends beyond the perimeter, backend mTLS becomes essential. Backend mTLS ensures secure communication by requiring both the load balancer and the backend to mutually verify their identities.
With backend authenticated TLS , the load balancer verifies the backend server's certificate by checking its chain of trust, thereby confirming the backend's identity. Conversely, with backend mTLS , the backend server verifies the client certificate presented by the load balancer. Together, these mechanisms enable backend mTLS, ensuring that both parties validate each other's identity.
Backend mTLS complements frontend mTLS, which is already generally available (GA).
For details, see the following:

Feature
Cloud Load Balancing supports load balancing to multi-NIC instances that use Dynamic NICs .
This capability is in Preview .
June 03, 2025
Feature
Cleartext HTTP/2 over TCP, also known as H2C, lets you use HTTP/2 without TLS. H2C is supported by internal and external Application Load Balancers for both of the following connections:
Connections between clients and the load balancer. No special configuration is required. Support for this capability is already in General Availability .
Connections between the load balancer and its backends. Support for this capability is now in General Availability .
To configure H2C for connections between the load balancer and its backends, you set the backend service protocol to H2C .
Feature
Application Load Balancers now support the use of custom metrics that let you configure your load balancer's traffic distribution behavior to be based on metrics specific to your application or infrastructure requirements, rather than Google Cloud's standard utilization or rate-based metrics. Defining custom metrics for your load balancer gives you the flexibility to route application requests to the backend instances and endpoints that are most optimal for your workload.
For more information, see Custom metrics for Application Load Balancers .
This capability is in General availability .
May 19, 2025
Feature
To take advantage of the new features of the global external Application Load Balancer, you can now migrate your classic Application Load Balancer resources to the global external Application Load Balancer infrastructure.
To migrate to the global external Application Load Balancer, you change the load balancing scheme of your load balancing resources—specifically, the backend services and forwarding rules—from EXTERNAL to EXTERNAL_MANAGED . You can also rollback resources to the classic Application Load Balancer infrastructure, as long as you do so within 90 days of changing the load balancing scheme.
Cloud Console support is also available to help you complete the migration process.
For more details on the migration process, see the following pages:
Migration overview
Migrate resources from classic to global external Application Load Balancer
Roll back migrated resources to classic Application Load Balancer
This capability is available in General availability .
May 16, 2025
Security
A security vulnerability was detected in the classic Application Load Balancer service prior to April 26, 2025.
CVE-2025-4600 allowed attackers to smuggle requests to classic Application Load Balancers due to incorrect parsing of oversized chunk bodies. This vulnerability was addressed within the classic Application Load Balancer service on April 26, 2025 through improved input validation and parsing logic.
No action is needed. For more information, see the GCP-2025-027 security bulletin .
May 14, 2025
Feature
Global and cross-region load balancers now support enabling traffic isolation on the service load balancing policy. By default, these load balancers use the WATERFALL_BY_REGION algorithm which allows traffic overflow to other regions when backends in the region closest to the user are either full or unhealthy. Enabling traffic isolation lets the load balancer route traffic only to the region closest to the user, even if all the backends in that region are running at their configured capacity limit. You can also choose to prevent traffic overflow entirely by enabling this feature in STRICT mode.
For details, see Traffic isolation .
This feature is in Preview .
May 08, 2025
Feature
Global external Application Load Balancers that use HTTPS as the backend service protocol can now negotiate TLS 1.3 for the connection from the load balancer to the backend.
For more details, see TLS support .
This capability is available in General Availability .
April 29, 2025
Feature
All Application and Proxy Network Load Balancers now support deployments where the load balancer frontend and the load balancer backend use different VPC networks. This is supported without the use of a Shared VPC deployment .
For regional and cross-region load balancers, connectivity between the load balancer's VPC network and the backend VPC network must be configured using either VPC Network Peering, Cloud VPN tunnels, Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachments, or a Network Connectivity Center framework.
For global and classic load balancers, the different VPC networks don't need to be connected using VPC Network Peering because GFEs communicate directly with backends in their respective VPC networks.
For more details, see the following pages:
External Application Load Balancer overview

April 25, 2025
Deprecated
Starting April 28, 2025, the Global external Application Load Balancer and the Classic Application Load Balancer will no longer allow the use of custom request headers that reference connection-specific hop-by-hop headers.
This change applies only to HTTP/1.1 traffic. Connection-specific hop-by-hop headers are already disallowed by the HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocols.
This change is in accordance with RFC 2616 which states that these connection-specific hop-by-hop headers headers are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection and should not be forwarded by proxies.
The impacted hop-by-hop headers are: Connection , Keep-Alive , TE , Trailer , Transfer-Encoding , and Upgrade .
Starting April 28, 2025 , connection-specific hop-by-hop headers that were configured by using custom headers will no longer be applied. These headers will only be set by the load balancer during normal connection handling.
Starting June 30, 2025 , any configuration changes that reference the connection-specific hop-by-hop custom headers will no longer be accepted.
What you need to do
If you are an HTTP/1.1 user affected by this change, complete the following steps:
Determine if your application depends on the values of any hop-by-hop headers configured as custom headers. If any dependencies are found, replace them with an allowed custom header and modify your application accordingly.
Review your backend service and URL map headerAction configuration to remove any references to connection-specific hop-by-hop headers.
March 17, 2025
Announcement
Google Cloud periodically renews Google-managed certificates by requesting them from certificate authorities (CAs). Certificate authorities verify domain control by checking DNS settings of the domain and in case of load balancer authorization attempting to contact the server behind the domain's IP address. The CAs that Google Cloud works with have introduced a verification method called Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration , that is becoming mandatory for all public CAs and that consists in performing the verification from multiple locations in the world. As a result, if DNS settings do not correctly and consistently resolve from all locations, the validation fails and Google-managed certificates will fail to renew.
To learn more about preventing multi-perspective domain validation failures for misconfigured DNS records, see Multi-perspective domain validation .

January 24, 2025
Announcement
Changes to RSA certificate requirements coming April 28, 2025
We're changing how Application Load Balancers establish TLS connections to backends. This change fixes a problem where the keyUsage extension of RSA certificates is not being validated consistently and might allow a certificate that should have been rejected based on the keyUsage configuration.
What you need to do
Starting April 28, 2025 , RSA certificates that don't meet the keyUsage configuration requirements will no longer be considered valid for establishing TLS connections. We recommend that you check whether your backends' RSA certificates are invalid, and replace them with valid certificates if needed.
A valid RSA certificate is one that has the X509v3 Key Usage extension and includes both the Digital Signature and Key Encipherment parameters.
To identify an invalid RSA certificate, perform the following steps:
First confirm that the certificate type is RSA by running the following command.
openssl x509 -text -in cert.crt | grep "Public Key Algorithm" .
For RSA certificates, this should output rsaEncryption . If it is a non-RSA certificate (for example, EC), you don't need to take any more action at this time.
If it is an RSA certificate, examine the Key Usage configuration by running the following command:
openssl x509 -text -in cert.crt | grep -A1 "X509v3 Key Usage"
For a valid RSA certificate, the correct value is Digital Signature, Key Encipherment . If either of these values is not present, the RSA certificate is invalid.
For more information about the X.509 certificate format, see RFC 5280 Key Usage .

Feature
Cloud Load Balancing now supports failover for global, classic, and regional external Application Load Balancers. Failover is handled by creating two or more regional external Application Load Balancers in the regions where you want the traffic to failover to. Only regional external Application Load Balancers can be used as failover backup load balancers.
For details, see Failover for external Application Load Balancers .

can now configure the mirrored backend service to receive only a percentage of the
requests by using the mirrorPercent flag to specify the percentage of
requests to be mirrored expressed as a value between 0 and 100.0.

Deprecated
The Global external Application Load Balancer and the Classic Application Load Balancer will no longer support TLS sessionID resumption. They continue to support modern forms of TLS resumption.
The TLS protocol supports an optimization which allows a client reconnecting to a server with which it has communicated before to perform a cheaper abbreviated handshake . This optimization is available in several modes, which include the modern PSK and ticket mechanisms, as well as the long-obsolete sessionID mechanism.
The Global external Application Load Balancer and the Classic Application Load Balancer are the only Google Cloud products that currently support the obsolete sessionID mechanism.
This sessionID mechanism is going to be disabled over the next 4-5 weeks. Clients that currently make use of sessionID will transparently fall back to full TLS handshakes. To recover the performance optimization gains, we recommend that you upgrade clients to modern TLS libraries which support the PSK or ticket mechanisms.
August 05, 2024
Feature
Regional external Application Load Balancer, regional internal Application Load Balancer, and cross-region internal Application Load Balancer support mutual TLS (mTLS).

Announcement
We're announcing the rebranding of Cloud Load Balancing into two main types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers .
Over the past few years, we've undertaken several initiatives to bring greater consistency across all flavors of Cloud Load Balancing - for example, by making Envoy proxy the consistent data plane for all new load balancing features. Now, to further help our users understand the different features available with Cloud Load Balancing, and help them quickly identify the best type of load balancer for their use-case, we're adopting a new naming convention.
What is the new naming convention?
Cloud Load Balancing now offers two types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. As a general rule, you'd choose an Application Load Balancer when you need a Layer 7 load balancer for your applications with HTTP(S) traffic. You'd choose a Network Load Balancer when you need a Layer 4 (TCP) load balancer that supports TLS offloading (with a proxy load balancer) or you need support for additional IP protocols such as UDP (with a passthrough load balancer).
Application and Network Load Balancers can be configured in various deployment modes, for example, internal (private networks) or external (internet facing), global or regional.
For more details, see the following topics:
Cloud Load Balancing overview
Choose a load balancer
The Google Cloud Console has also been updated to reflect these changes. No changes have been made to the API.

Feature
Currently, health check probes for hybrid NEGs originate from Google's
centralized health checking mechanism. If you cannot
allow traffic that originates from the Google health check ranges to reach your
hybrid endpoints and would prefer to have the health check probes originate from
your own private IP addresses instead, speak to your Google account representative to get
your project allowlisted for distributed Envoy health checks .
This feature is available in Preview for allowlisted projects only.

Feature
Internal HTTP(S) load balancers and internal TCP proxy load balancers now support global access . By default, clients for these load balancers must be in the same region as the load balancer. With global access enabled, clients can access the load balancer from any region. They still must be in the same VPC network as the load balancer or in a VPC network that's connected to the load balancer's VPC network by using VPC Network Peering.

November 14, 2022
Change
We're introducing a change in behavior for custom headers used with Global external HTTP(S) load balancers.
This change doesn't affect projects that have any traffic using custom headers before November 14, 2022 . Only projects that aren't currently using any custom headers (with either backend services or URL maps) are affected. If you are using custom headers as of November 14, 2022, you'll still see the behavior in the Before column.
The following tables describe changes in behavior applicable only to the global external HTTP(S) load balancers with advanced traffic management. The classic external HTTP(S) load balancers already behave this way when you configure custom headers on backend services. Configuring custom headers on URL maps isn't supported by the classic external HTTP(S) load balancers.
Custom headers configured on backend services
Before
After
Custom request header values are appended to headers on incoming requests.
Custom request header values replace headers on incoming requests.
If a custom request header value resolves to an empty string, it is ignored.
If a custom request header value resolves to an empty string, it is added to the headers, and replaces the existing header value for this header name.
For example, if this is your backend service configuration:
customRequestHeaders: 'x-special-custom-header:'
customRequestHeaders: 'x-resolvable-custom-header:{client_city}'
And this is the incoming client request:
curl your-domain.com \
-H "x-special-custom-header:client-value" \
-H "x-resolvable-custom-header: NorthPole"
-H "extra-header: some-content"
Before the change , this would be the request sent to the backend with the custom header appended to the client header:
Host: your-domain.com
x-special-custom-header: client-value
x-resolvable-custom-header: NorthPole,ActualClientCity
extra-header: some-content
After the change , this is the request sent to the backend with the custom header replacing the client header:
Host: your-domain.com
x-special-custom-header:
x-resolvable-custom-header: ActualClientCity
extra-header: some-content
Custom headers configured on URL maps
Before
After
If a headerValue in requestHeadersToAdd cannot be resolved or resolves to an empty string, the header is ignored.
If a headerValue in requestHeadersToAdd cannot be resolved or resolves to an empty string, the header is added, either replacing or appending to existing values based on the replace field.
When custom header variables are present, requestHeaderToAdd always defaults to replace: false .
When custom header variables are present, requestHeaderToAdd now defaults to replace: true .
For example, if this is your URL map configuration:
requestHeadersToAdd:
- headerName: 'x-special-custom-header'
headerValue: ''
And this is the incoming client request:
curl your-domain.com \
-H "x-special-custom-header:client-value"
Before the change , requestHeaderToAdd defaults to replace: false , so the custom header does not override the client value. The following is the request sent to the backend:
Host: your-domain.com
x-special-custom-header: client-value
After the change , requestHeaderToAdd defaults to replace: true , so the custom header value replaces the client value. The following is the request sent to the backend:
Host: your-domain.com
x-special-custom-header:

Feature
Symmetric hashing for internal TCP/UDP load balancers as next hops —When load balancing to multiple NICs on the backends, you no longer need to use source network address translation (SNAT). SNAT isn't required because Google Cloud uses symmetric hashing. This means that when packets belong to the same flow, Google Cloud calculates the same hash. In other words, the hash doesn't change when the source IP address:port is swapped with the destination IP address:port.

TLS v1.3 is now enabled by default for all external HTTPS load balancers, SSL proxy load balancers, and Cloud CDN. Note that this change doesn't apply to internal HTTPS load balancers or Traffic Director.
TLS v1.3 supports modern ciphers with forward-secrecy as a baseline and, critically, reduces the number of round trips required to establish a TLS session, which directly improves performance seen by your end-users.
Clients that support TLS v1.3 include Chrome, Chromium-based browsers, and Android. These clients automatically negotiate TLS v1.3 without requiring any changes. Clients that do not support TLS v1.3 are unaffected.
