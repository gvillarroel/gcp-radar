URL maps overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud Application Load Balancers and Cloud Service Mesh use a Google Cloud
configuration resource called a URL map to route HTTP(S) requests to backend
services or backend buckets.
For example, with an external Application Load Balancer, you can use a single URL map
to route requests to different destinations based on the rules
configured in the URL map:
Requests for https://example.com/video go to one backend service.
Requests for https://example.com/audio go to a different backend service.
Requests for https://example.com/images go to a Cloud Storage
backend bucket.
Requests for any other host and path combination go to a default backend
service.
URL maps are used with the following Google Cloud products:
External Application Load Balancer (global, regional, and classic
modes)
Internal Application Load Balancer (cross-region and
regional modes)
Cloud Service Mesh , when
Cloud Service Mesh is deployed with the load balancing APIs
There are two types of URL map resources available: global and regional.
Global urlMaps are used by
global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, cross-region internal Application Load Balancers,
and Cloud Service Mesh.
regionUrlMaps are used by
regional external Application Load Balancers, regional internal Application Load Balancers, and Cloud Service Mesh.
The type of resource that you use depends on the product's load balancing
scheme.

Not all URL map features are available for all products. URL maps used with
global external Application Load Balancers, regional external Application Load Balancers, internal Application Load Balancers
and Cloud Service Mesh also support several advanced
traffic management features. For more information about these differences, see
Load balancer feature comparison: Routing and traffic
management . In
addition, regional URL maps can be a resource that's designated as a service
in App Hub applications .
How URL maps work
When a request arrives at the load balancer, the load balancer routes the
request to a particular backend service or a backend bucket based on the rules
defined in the URL map.
A backend service represents a collection of backends, which are instances of an
application or microservice. A backend bucket is a Cloud Storage
bucket , which is commonly used to host
static content, such as images.
For regional external Application Load Balancers, internal Application Load Balancers, and Cloud Service Mesh, possible
destinations are the following:
Default backend service
Non-default backend service
Additionally, global external Application Load Balancers support the following:
Default backend bucket
Non-default backend bucket
For example, assume that you have the following setup:
One IP address:
All requests to your organization go to the same IP address and the same
load balancer.
Traffic is directed to different backend services based on the request URL.
Two domains:
example.net hosts training videos.
example.org hosts your organization website.
Four sets of servers:
One hosts your organization website (backend service: org-site ).
One hosts the overall training video website (backend service:
video-site ).
One hosts high definition (HD) training videos (backend service:
video-hd ).
One hosts standard definition (SD) training videos (backend service:
video-sd ).
You want the following to happen:
Requests to example.org (or any domain other than example.net ) to go to
the org-site backend service.
Requests to example.net that don't match more specific paths to go to the
video-site backend service.
Requests to example.net/video/hd/* to go to the video-hd backend service.
Requests to example.net/video/sd/* to go to the video-sd backend service.
A --path-rule for /video/* matches URIs such as /video/test1 and /video/test2 . However, this path rule doesn't match the path
/video .
If the load balancer receives a request with /../ in the URL, the load
balancer transforms the URL by removing the path segment before the .. , and
responds with the transformed URL. For example, when a request is sent for
http://example.net/video/../abc , the load balancer responds with a 302
redirect to http://example.net/abc . Most clients then react by issuing a
request to the URL returned by the load balancer (in this case,
http://example.net/abc ). This 302 redirection isn't logged in
Cloud Logging.
The URL map lets you set up this type of host and path-based routing.

Load balancer naming
For Application Load Balancers, the name of the load balancer is always the same
as the name of the URL map. The behavior for each Google Cloud interface
is as follows:
Google Cloud console . If you create an Application Load Balancer by using the
Google Cloud console, the URL map is automatically assigned the same name
that you entered for the load balancer name.
Google Cloud CLI or API . If you create an Application Load Balancer by
using the gcloud CLI or the API, you enter a name of your choice
while creating the URL map. This URL map name is then reflected in the
Google Cloud console as the name of the load balancer.
To learn about how naming works for Proxy Network Load Balancers and
Passthrough Network Load Balancers, see Backend services overview: Load balancer
naming .
URL map components
A URL map is a set of Google Cloud configuration
resources that direct requests
for URLs to backend services
or backend buckets. The URL map does so by using the
hostname and path portions for each URL it processes:
A hostname is the domain name portion of a URL; for
example, the hostname portion of the URL http://example.net/video/hd is
example.net .
A path is the portion of a URL following the hostname and optional port
number; for example, the path portion of the URL http://example.net/video/hd
is /video/hd .
Load balancer configuration with basic URL map (click to enlarge).
This diagram shows the structure of the load balancing configuration objects
in relation to each other.
Note: The diagram isn't intended to show the processing flow for requests.
You control which backend services
or backend buckets receive incoming requests by using the
following URL map configuration parameters:
Default backend service or default backend bucket. When you create a
URL map, you must specify either a default backend service or a default backend
bucket, but not both. This default represents the backend service or backend
bucket to which Google Cloud directs requests for URLs with any hostname,
unless there is an applicable host rule .
Note: Backend buckets are not supported with internal Application Load Balancers and
Cloud Service Mesh.
Host rule ( hostRules ). A host rule directs requests sent to one or more
associated hostnames to a single path matcher ( pathMatchers ). The hostname
portion of a URL is either exactly matched or matched using regular
expressions against the set of the host rule's configured
hostnames. In a URL map host and path rule, if you omit the host, the rule
matches any requested host. To direct requests for
http://example.net/video/hd to a path matcher, you need a single host rule
that at least includes the hostname example.net . That same host rule could
also handle requests for other hostnames, but it would direct them to the same
path matcher.
If you need to direct requests to different path matchers, you must use
different host rules. Two host rules in a URL map can't include the same hostname.
It is possible to match all hostnames by specifying the wildcard character
* in the host rule. For example, for the URLs http://example.org ,
http://example.net/video/hd , and http://example.com/audio , all three
hostnames example.org , example.net , and example.com can be matched by
specifying * in the host rule. It is also possible to match a partial
hostname by specifying the wildcard character * . For example, a host rule
*.example.net is matched against both hostnames news.example.net and
finance.example.net .
Port number. Classic Application Load Balancers handle port numbers differently
than other Application Load Balancers. In the case of the
classic Application Load Balancer, only the hostname in the URL is considered when
matching a host rule. For example, example.net requests for port 8080 and
port 80 match the host rule example.net . For all other
Application Load Balancers, you can use the Host rule parameter to specify a
port number. For example, to direct example.net requests for port 8080, set
the host rule to example.net:8080 .
Note: The load balancer doesn't validate the value of the hostname in the
URL. Clients can set arbitrary values for the hostname, for example by
setting the Host header. You shouldn't use the hostname field to implement
access control for your application.
Path matcher ( pathMatchers ). A path matcher is the configuration
parameter referenced by a host rule. It defines the relationship between the
path portion of a URL and the backend service or backend bucket that should
serve the request. A path matcher consists of two elements:
Path matcher default backend service or path matcher default backend
bucket. For each path matcher, you must at least specify a default
backend service or default backend bucket, but not both. This default
represents the backend service or backend bucket to which
Google Cloud directs requests for URLs whose hostnames match a host
rule associated with the path matcher, and whose URL paths don't match any
path rule in the path matcher.
Path rules. For each path matcher, you can specify one or more path
rules, which are key-value pairs mapping a URL path to a single backend
service or backend bucket.
Flexible pattern matching operators let you match multiple parts of a URL
path, including partial URLs and suffixes (file extensions), by using
wildcard syntax. These operators can be helpful when you need to route
traffic and execute rewrites based on complex URL paths. You can also
associate one or more path components with named variables and then refer
to those variables when rewriting the URL. With named variables, you can
reorder and remove URL components before the request is sent to your
origin. For details, see Wildcards, regular expressions, and dynamic URLs
in path rules .
If you need more advanced routing capabilities, for example, if you want
to direct traffic for a unique URL to multiple services, you can use route
rules instead of path rules.
Route rules. Route rules can be used as an alternative to path rules
when you need advanced traffic routing capabilities such as routing
traffic based on the URL path, HTTP headers, and query parameters.
You can configure route rules with flexible pattern matching operators and
named variables. These operators can be helpful when you need to route
traffic and execute rewrites based on complex URL paths. For details, see
Wildcards and pattern matching operators in path templates for route
rules .
You can also configure route rules to be matched against regular
expressions that match the path, query parameters, or headers in the
incoming request. For details, see Regular expressions in route
rules .
To learn more about the configuration options for route rules,
see Advanced host, path, and route rule .
Hostname and host rule relationship
A hostname can only reference a single host rule.
A single host rule can process multiple hostnames.
Host rule and path matcher relationship
Multiple host rules can reference a single path matcher.
A host rule can only reference a single path matcher.
URL and backend relationship
Each unique URL is directed to only one backend service or backend bucket.
Consequently:
Google Cloud uses the hostname portion of a URL to select a single
host rule and its referenced path matcher.
When you use path rules in a path matcher, you cannot create more than one
path rule for the same path. For example, requests for /videos/hd cannot
be directed to more than one backend service or backend bucket. Backend
services can have backend instance groups or backend network endpoint groups
(NEGs) in different zones and regions, and you can create backend buckets
that use Multi-Regional Storage classes.
To direct traffic for a unique URL to multiple services, you can use route
rules instead of path rules. If you configure the path matcher with route
rules for header or parameter matches, a unique URL can be directed to more
than one backend service or bucket, based on the contents of headers or
query parameters on the URL.
Similarly for regional external Application Load Balancers and Cloud Service Mesh, weighted
backend services on route actions can direct the same URL to multiple
backend services or buckets, depending on the weights set on the weighted
backend service.
URL maps and protocols
You can use the same URL map, host rules, and path matchers to process both HTTP
and HTTPS requests submitted by clients, as long as both a target HTTP proxy and
a target HTTPS proxy reference the URL map.
Simplest URL map
The simplest URL map only has a default backend service or a default backend
bucket. It contains no host rules and no path matchers. Either the default
backend service or the default backend bucket (whichever one you defined)
handles all requested URLs.
If you define a default backend service, Google Cloud directs requests to
its backend instance groups or backend NEGs according to the backend service's
configuration.
URL map with no rules except default (click to enlarge).
Order of operations
For a given hostname and path in a requested URL, Google Cloud uses the
following procedure to direct the request to the correct backend service
or backend bucket, as configured in your URL map:
If the URL map does not contain a host rule for the URL's hostname,
Google Cloud directs requests to the URL map's default backend service
or default backend bucket, depending on which one you defined.
If the URL map contains a host rule that includes the URL's hostname, the path
matcher referenced by that host rule is consulted:
If the path matcher contains a path rule that exactly matches the URL's
path, Google Cloud directs requests to the backend service or
backend bucket for that path rule.
If the path matcher does not contain a path rule that exactly matches
the URL's path, but does contain a path rule ending in /* whose prefix
matches the longest section of the URL's path, then Google Cloud
directs requests to the backend service or backend bucket for that path
rule. For example, for the URL map containing two path matcher rules
/video/hd/movie1 and /video/hd/* , if the URL contains the exact path
/video/hd/movie1 , it is matched against that path rule.
If neither of the previous conditions is true, Google Cloud directs
requests to the path matcher's default backend service or default backend
bucket, depending on which one you defined.
URL map configuration constraints
The following sections describe certain configuration constraints for URL map
components.
Regular expressions matchers in host and route rules
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Host rules allow you to match the hostname portion of a URL against the set
of the host rule's configured hostnames. You can choose to use either a specific
hostname or a wildcard * in the hostRules[].hosts[] field to be matched
against the hostname in the incoming request.
Route rules allow you to define match rules that can match a regular
expression either in the path or in the query string or in a header in the
incoming request. Route rules support the use of regular expressions for the
following URL map fields:
pathMatchers[].routeRules[].matchRules[].regexMatch : A regular expression
that is used to match the path of the incoming request.
pathMatchers[].routeRules[].matchRules[].headerMatches[].regexMatch : A
regular expression that contains a predicate that matches a header of the
incoming request.
pathMatchers[].routeRules[].matchRules[].queryParameterMatches[].regexMatch :
A regular expression that contains a predicate that matches a query parameter
of the incoming request.
A request is considered to have matched a routeRule when any of the matchRules
are satisfied. However predicates within a given matchRule have AND semantics.
That is, all predicates within a matchRule must match for the request to match
the rule.
Additional usage notes:
Regular expressions are supported only for the following products:
Regional internal Application Load Balancers
Cross-region internal Application Load Balancers
Regional external Application Load Balancers
Global and classic Application Load Balancers don't support regular expressions.
You must use RE2 syntax to
construct your regular expressions. For the complete list of limitations and
operators permitted in URL maps, see RE2 specifications for URL
maps .
Regular expression matching is expensive in terms of memory consumption and
request processing latencies. If you choose to use regular expression
matching, you must factor in the performance degradation when you plan your
deployment. For example, if you have a URL map with a single regular
expression, you can expect the load balancer latency to increase by 100
microseconds per request. If your URL map has 5 regular expressions to be
matched, you can expect latency to increase by 200 microseconds per request.
Example #1: Use a regular expression to match path
The path is considered a match if it matches the regular expression specified by
regexMatch after removing any query parameters and anchors supplied with the
original URL. For example, in the following sample URL maps, the route rule
regular expression, /videos/hd.* , would apply to a URL with the path
/videos/hd-abcd?key=245 .
defaultService : projects/example-project/global/backendServices/org-site
name : rule-match-url-map
hostRules :
- hosts :
- '*' # Match any host
pathMatcher : video-matcher
- hosts :
- example.net
pathMatcher : video-matcher
pathMatchers :
- name : video-matcher
# Optional: default service for this path matcher if no routeRules match
defaultService : projects/example-project/global/backendServices/video-site
routeRules :
- priority : 100000
matchRules :
- regexMatch : /videos/hd.*
routeAction :
weightedBackendServices :
- backendService : projects/example-project/global/backendServices/video-hd
weight : 100
Here is an explanation for each field of the sample URL map:
defaultService : Specifies the default backend service to use
if no other rules in the URL map match the incoming request.
name : Assigns the name rule-match-url-map to this URL map configuration.
hostRules : Defines a list of rules for matching the host header
of incoming requests. The first rule matches any host ( * ) and directs
traffic to the pathMatcher named video-matcher . The second rule
specifically matches the host example.net and also directs traffic to the
path matcher named video-matcher .
pathMatchers : Defines a list of named path matchers.
name : Defines a path matcher named video-matcher .
defaultService : Sets the default service for this path.
matcher. This service is used if a request matches the host rule(s) pointing
to video-matcher but doesn't match any of the routeRules within it.
routeRules : Contains a list of rules to match the URL path.
priority : Sets the priority of this rule to 100000. Rules are evaluated in
order from lowest to highest priority number.
matchRules : Contains the conditions for this route rule to be matched.
regexMatch : This condition checks if the URL path matches the regular
expression /videos/hd.* (for example, "/videos/hd" and
"/videos/hd-caching").
routeAction : Specifies the action to take if all conditions in matchRules
are met.
weightedBackendServices : Distributes traffic among a list of backend
services based on weights.
backendService : Specifies the backend service to route traffic to.
weight : Assigns a weight of 100 to this backend service. Since it's the
only service in the list, it will receive 100% of the traffic that matches
this routeRule.
The following URL map shows a similar example without using a routeAction .
defaultService : projects/example-project/global/backendServices/video-site
name : path-matcher-videos
routeRules :
matchRules :
- regexMatch : /videos/hd.*
priority : 100000
service : projects/example-project/global/backendServices/video-hd
Example #2: Use a regular expression to match headers
The header is considered a match if the value of the header matches the regular
expression specified by regexMatch . For example, in the following sample URL
map, the header name regular expression, .*Android.*-hd , would apply to a
request with the header User-Agent:123Androidabc-hd .
defaultService : projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/backendServices/default-backend-service
name : header-match-url-map
hostRules :
- hosts :
- '*' # Match any host
pathMatcher : header-matcher
pathMatchers :
- name : header-matcher
# Optional: default service for this path matcher if no routeRules match
defaultService : projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/backendServices/default-backend-service
routeRules :
- priority : 1
matchRules :
- headerMatches :
- headerName : User-Agent
regexMatch : .*Android.*-hd
# This prefix match applies to the path part of the URL
- prefixMatch : /video/
# service: can be used instead of routeAction if no other actions are needed
service : projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/backendServices/video-backend-service
# Alternatively, use routeAction to specify the service:
# routeAction:
# weightedBackendServices:
# - backendService: projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/backendServices/video-backend-service
# weight: 100
Here is an explanation for each field of the sample URL map:
defaultService : Specifies the default backend service to use
if no other rules in the URL map match the incoming request.
name : Assigns the name header-match-url-map to this URL map configuration.
hostRules : Defines a list of rules for matching the host header of incoming
requests. The rule matches any host ('*') and directs traffic to the
pathMatcher named header-matcher.
pathMatchers : Defines a list of named path matchers.
name : Defines a path matcher named header-matcher .
defaultService : Sets the default service for this path matcher. This service
is used if a request matches the host rule but doesn't match any of the
routeRules within this path matcher.
routeRules : Contains a list of rules to match incoming requests based on
headers and paths.
priority : Sets the priority of this rule to 1. Rules are evaluated in order
from lowest to highest priority number.
matchRules : Contains a list of conditions that must all be true for the
rule to match.
headerMatches : Specifies conditions based on request headers.
headerName : Looks for the User-Agent header.
regexMatch : Checks if the User-Agent header value matches the regular
expression .*Android.*-hd . This would match User-Agents indicating an
Android device, with a string containing "-hd".
prefixMatch : Set to /video/ , this condition checks if the URL path starts
with "/video/".
service : If all matchRules conditions are met, traffic is directed
to this backend service.
The commented-out routeAction section shows an alternative way to specify
the backend service, which would be necessary if you needed to configure
other route actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, or weighted
backend services.
Example #3: Use a regular expression to match query parameters
The query parameter is considered a match if the value of the path with the
query parameters matches the regular expression specified by regexMatch . For
example, in the following sample URL map, the query parameter regular
expression, /im.*/.*.html , would apply to a URL with query parameters such as
/images/random_page.html?param1=param_value_123abc-hd .
defaultService : projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/backendServices/sample-bs
name : query-match-url-map
hostRules :
- hosts :
- '*' # Match any host
pathMatcher : query-matcher
pathMatchers :
- name : query-matcher
# Optional: default service for this path matcher if no routeRules match
defaultService : projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/backendServices/sample-bs
routeRules :
- priority : 1
matchRules :
- queryParameterMatches :
- name : param1 #parameter name in query
regexMatch : param_value_.*-hd
# This regexMatch applies to the path part of the URL
- regexMatch : /im.*/.*.html
# Directs traffic to this service if all conditions in matchRules are met
service : projects/example-project/regions/us-central1/backendServices/sample-images-bs
Here is an explanation for each field of the sample URL map:
hostRules : Adds a rule to match all hosts ( * ) and directs traffic to the
pathMatcher named query-matcher .
pathMatchers : Defines a path matcher named query-matcher .
routeRules : Places the provided routeRules block within query-matcher .
priority : Sets the priority of this rule to 1. Rules are evaluated in order
from lowest to highest priority number.
matchRules : Contains the conditions for the routeRules .
queryParameterMatches : Checks if the query parameter named "param1"
matches the regular expression param_value_.*-hd .
regexMatch : The /im.*/.*.html regular expression applies to the path of
the URL (for example, /images/random_page.html), before the query string.
service : Specifies the backend service to use if all conditions within the
matchRules are true.
Wildcards, regular expressions, and dynamic URLs in path rules and prefix match
A path rule ( pathMatchers[].pathRules[] ) can only include a
wildcard character ( * ) after a
forward slash character ( / ). For example, /videos/* and /videos/hd/*
are valid for path rules, but /videos* and /videos/hd* are not.
Path rules don't use regular expressions or substring matching.
PathTemplateMatch can use simplified path
matching operators. For example, path rules for either /videos/hd or
/videos/hd/* don't apply to a URL with the path /video/hd-abcd .
However, a path rule for /video/* does apply to that path.
A prefix match ( pathMatchers[].routeRules[].matchRules[].prefixMatch )
does not treat * as a wildcard character, but as a literal character.
Path matchers (and URL maps in general) don't offer features that function
like Apache's <LocationMatch> directive. If you have an application that
generates dynamic URL paths that have a common prefix, such as /videos/hd-abcd
and /videos/hd-pqrs , and you need to send requests made to those paths to
different backend services, you might not be able to do that with a
URL map. For cases containing only a few possible dynamic URLs, you
might be able to create a path matcher with a limited set of path rules.
For more complex cases, you need to do path-based regular expression
matching on your backends.
Wildcards and pattern matching operators in path templates for route rules
Flexible pattern matching operators let you match multiple parts of a URL path,
including partial URLs and suffixes (file extensions), by using wildcard syntax.
These operators can be helpful when you need to route traffic and execute
rewrites based on complex URL paths. You can also associate one or more path
components with named variables and then refer to those variables when rewriting
the URL. With named variables, you can reorder and remove URL components before
the request is sent to your origin.
Pattern matching with wildcards is supported only for the following products:
Global external Application Load Balancer
Regional external Application Load Balancer
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Cross-region internal Application Load Balancer
Cloud Service Mesh
The following example routes traffic for an eCommerce application that has
separate services for cart information and user information.
You can configure routeRules with flexible pattern matching operators and
named variables to send the user's unique ID to a user account details page
and the user's cart information to a cart processing service after
rewriting the URL.
pathMatchers:
- name: cart-matcher
routeRules:
- description: CartService
matchRules:
- pathTemplateMatch: '/xyzwebservices/v2/xyz/users/{username=*}/carts/{cartid=**}'
service: cart-backend
priority: 1
routeAction:
urlRewrite:
pathTemplateRewrite: '/{username}-{cartid}/'
- name: user-matcher
routeRules:
- description: UserService
matchRules:
- pathTemplateMatch: '/xyzwebservices/v2/xyz/users/*/accountinfo/*'
service: user-backend
priority: 1
Here's what happens when a client requests
/xyzwebservices/v2/xyz/users/abc@xyz.com/carts/FL0001090004/entries/SJFI38u3401nms?fields=FULL&client_type=WEB ,
which has both user information and cart information:
The request path matches the pathTemplateMatch within the cart-matcher
pathMatcher. The {username=*} variable matches abc@xyz.com and the
{cartid=**} variable matches FL0001090004/entries/SJFI38u3401nms .
The query parameters are split off from the path, the path is rewritten
based on pathTemplateRewrite , and the query parameters are appended to
the rewritten path. We must only use the same variables that we used to
define the pathTemplateMatch in our pathTemplateRewrite .
The rewritten request is sent to cart-backend with the rewritten URL path:
/abc@xyz.com-FL0001090004/entries/SJFI38u3401nms?fields=FULL&client_type=WEB .
The following happens when a client requests
/xyzwebservices/v2/xyz/users/abc%40xyz.com/accountinfo/abc-1234 instead,
which has only user and account information:
The request path matches the pathTemplateMatch within the user-matcher
pathMatcher. The first * matches abc%40xyz.com and the second * matches
abc-1234 .
The request is sent to user-backend .
The following table outlines the syntax for path template patterns.

A single path segment, not including the surrounding path
separator / characters.
**
Matches zero or more characters, including any path separator
/ characters between multiple path segments. If other operators
are included, the ** operator must be the last operator.
{name} or {name=*}
A named variable matching one path segment. Matches a single path
segment, not including the surrounding path separator /
characters.
{name=news/*}
A named variable explicitly matching two path segments:
news and a * wildcard segment.
{name=*/news/*}
A named variable matching three path segments.
{name=**}
A named variable matching zero or more characters. If present,
must be the last operator.
When you use these operators for flexible pattern matching, keep these
considerations in mind:
Multiple operators can be combined in a single pattern.
Query parameters are split off from the path, the path is rewritten
based on pathTemplateRewrite , and the query parameters are appended to
the rewritten path.
Requests are not percent-encoding normalized. For example, a URL with a
percent-encoded slash character (%2F) is not decoded into the unencoded form.
Each variable name, such as {segment} or {region} , can appear only once in
the same pattern. Multiple variables of the same name are invalid and are
rejected.
Variable names are case-sensitive and must be valid identifiers. To check if
a variable name is valid, ensure that it matches the regular expression
^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$ .
{API} , {api} , and {api_v1} are all valid identifiers. They identify
three distinct variables.
{1} , {_api} , and {10alpha} are not valid identifiers.
There's a limit of five operators per template pattern.
To execute an optional URL rewrite before the request is sent to the origin,
you can use the same variables that you defined to capture a path.
For example, you can reference, reorder, or omit variables in the
pathTemplateRewrite field when defining urlRewrite .
When you use variables and operators for flexible pattern matching for URL
rewrites, keep these considerations in mind:
When rewriting a URL, you can omit variables if they're not required as part
of the rewritten URL.
Prior to any rewrites, you can identify the URL sent by the client
at your origin by inspecting response headers. The original client URL is populated
with the x-client-request-url header and the x-envoy-original-path header.
Example URL map workflow with an external Application Load Balancer
The following example illustrates the order of operations for a URL
map . This example configures only the URL map for an existing
classic Application Load Balancer. For conceptual simplicity, it only uses backend
services; however, you can substitute backend buckets instead. To learn how to
create the load balancer's other components, see Create a
classic Application Load Balancer .
For more information about creating and configuring URL maps with path matchers
and host rules, see the gcloud compute url-maps create
documentation .
Create a URL map for the load balancer and specify a default backend service.
This example creates a URL map named video-org-url-map that references an
existing backend service named org-site .
gcloud compute url-maps create video-org-url-map \
--default-service=org-site
Create a path matcher named video-matcher with the following
characteristics:
The default backend service is video-site , an existing backend service.
Add path rules that direct requests for the exact URL path /video/hd
or the URL path prefix /video/hd/* to an existing backend service named
video-hd .
Add path rules that direct requests for the exact URL path /video/sd
or the URL path prefix /video/sd/* to an existing backend service named
video-sd .
gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher video-org-url-map \
--path-matcher-name=video-matcher \
--default-service=video-site \
--path-rules=/video/hd=video-hd,/video/hd/*=video-hd,/video/sd=video-sd,/video/sd/*=video-sd
Create a host rule for the example.net hostname that references the
video-matcher path matcher.
gcloud compute url-maps add-host-rule video-org-url-map \
--hosts=example.net \
--path-matcher-name=video-matcher
The video-org-url-map URL map should look like this:

The video-org-url-map URL map directs requested URLs to backends in the
following way.
URL map with a path rule, path matchers, and a host rule
(click to enlarge).
The following table explains the request processing shown in the preceding diagram.
Hostname
URL paths
Selected backend service
Reason for selection
Hostname: example.org and all other hostnames
different from example.net
all paths
org-site
The hostname is not in any host rule of the URL map, so the request
is directed to the URL map's default backend service.
Hostname: example.net
/video
/video/examples
video-site
The request goes to the default backend service because there is no
path rule for /video/ or /video/* . The host
rule for example.net references a path matcher,
but that path matcher does not have any path rules that would apply to
these paths.
Hostname: example.net
/video/hd
/video/hd/movie1
/video/hd/movies/movie2
Other URLs that begin with /video/hd/*
video-hd
A host rule for example.net references a path matcher
whose path rules direct requests for URL paths that either exactly match
/video/hd or that begin with /video/hd/* to
the video-hd backend service.
Hostname: example.net
/video/sd
/video/sd/show1
/video/sd/shows/show2
Other URLs that begin with /video/sd/*
video-sd
A host rule for example.net references a path matcher
whose path rules direct requests for URL paths that either exactly match
/video/sd or that begin with /video/sd/* to
the video-sd backend service.
URL redirects
A URL redirect redirects your domain's visitors from one URL to another.
A default URL redirect is not conditioned on matching any particular pattern
in the incoming request. For example, you might want to use a default URL
redirect to redirect any hostname to a hostname of your choice.
There are several ways to create a URL redirect, as outlined in the following
table.
Method
Configuration
URL map's default URL redirect
Top-level defaultUrlRedirect
A path matcher's default URL redirect
pathMatchers[].defaultUrlRedirect[]
A path matcher's path rule's URL redirect
pathMatchers[].pathRules[].urlRedirect
A path matcher's route rule's URL redirect
pathMatchers[].routeRules[].urlRedirect
Inside of a defaultUrlRedirect or urlRedirect , pathRedirect always works
as follows:
The entire request path is replaced with the path you specify.
Inside of a defaultUrlRedirect or urlRedirect , how the prefixRedirect works
depends on how you use it:
If you use a defaultUrlRedirect , prefixRedirect is effectively a
prefix prepend because the matched path is always / .
If you use a urlRedirect within a path matcher's route rule or path
rule, prefixRedirect is a prefix replacement based on how the requested
path was matched as defined in the path rule or route rule .
Redirect examples
The following table provides some examples of redirect configurations. The
right-hand column shows the API configuration for a default URL redirect.
