SSL certificates overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
SSL/TLS is the most widely used cryptographic protocol on the internet.
Technically, TLS is the successor to SSL, although the terms are sometimes used
interchangeably, as they are in this document.
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to encrypt information while it is sent
over a network, providing privacy between a client and a server or load
balancer. An Application Load Balancer or proxy Network Load Balancer that uses SSL requires
at least one private key and SSL certificate.
Note: This page discusses SSL certificates and encryption in transit between an
Application Load Balancer or proxy Network Load Balancer that uses SSL and its clients. For
details about encryption in transit between the Google Cloud load balancer
and its backends, see Encryption to the
backends .
Certificate configuration methods
Google Cloud offers three certificate configuration methods for
Application Load Balancers using target HTTPS proxies and proxy Network Load Balancers using
target SSL proxies.
Target proxy references Compute Engine SSL certificates : with this
method, the load balancer's target proxy can reference up to 15
Compute Engine SSL certificate
resources . Each
Compute Engine SSL certificate resource contains the private key,
corresponding certificate, and—optionally—CA certificates.
Target proxy references a Certificate Manager certificate map :
with this method, the load balancer's target proxy
references a single certificate map . The
certificate map supports thousands of entries by default, and can scale to
millions of entries. Each entry contains private key and certificate data.
Target proxy references Certificate Manager certificates
directly : with this method, the load balancer's target proxy can reference
up to 100 Certificate Manager
certificates .

Configuration method rules
Google Cloud enforces the following certificate configuration method
rules:
For load balancers that support both Compute Engine SSL certificates
and Certificate Manager certificate maps : the load balancer's
target proxy can simultaneously reference both a certificate map and one or
more Compute Engine SSL certificates.
Caution: When you use both Compute Engine certificates and
certificate maps, all Compute Engine SSL certificates are ignored and
only the certificates from the certificate map are used by the load balancer.
For load balancers that support both Compute Engine SSL certificates
and directly-attached Certificate Manager certificates : the load
balancer's target proxy can only be configured to reference up to 15
Compute Engine SSL certificates or up to 100
Certificate Manager certificates, not a combination of both.
Certificate types
Google Cloud supports both self-managed and Google-managed certificates.
Self-managed SSL certificates
Self-managed SSL certificates are certificates that you obtain, provision,
and renew yourself. Self-managed certificates can be any of these Public key
certificate
types:
Domain Validation (DV)
Organization Validation (OV)
Extended Validation (EV) certificates
You can create self-managed SSL certificates using:
Compute Engine SSL certificate resources : for more information,
see Use self-managed SSL
certificates .
Certificate Manager : for more information, see Deployment
overview in the
Certificate Manager documentation.
Google-managed SSL certificates
Google-managed SSL certificates are certificates that Google Cloud
obtains, manages, and renews automatically. Google-managed certificates are
always Domain Validation (DV) certificates. They don't demonstrate the
identity of an organization or individual associated with the certificate.
Google-managed certificates using wildcards are only supported by
Certificate Manager when using DNS authorization.
You can create Google-managed SSL certificates using:
Compute Engine SSL certificate resources : only global
Compute Engine sslCertificates resources support Google-managed
SSL certificates; regionSslCertificates don't support them.
Global Compute Engine SSL certificates support only publicly trusted
Google-managed certificates. For more
information, see Use Google-managed SSL
certificates .
Certificate Manager : Certificate Manager
certificates (both global and regional) support both
publicly trusted Google-managed certificates and
privately trusted Google-managed certificates. For more information, see
Certificates in the
Certificate Manager documentation.
Supported key types
Load balancers support certificates that use private keys of different key
types. The following table shows the key type support depending on whether the
certificates are global or regional, and whether they are self-managed or Google
managed.

Important: You incur charges per TLS connection when you use RSA-3072 or
RSA-4096 key types. For more information, see All networking pricing .

Certificate Manager documentation .
Use certificates with ECDSA keys
This section examines why we recommend ECDSA over RSA
as a best practice for certificate signing keys.
Which key type to use
ECDSA P-256 is the recommended choice of key type for most TLS certificates,
offering strong cryptographic security along with excellent performance
for signing operations and efficient use of network bandwidth.
Some of the possible reasons to use other certificate key types are as follows:
If you need to support legacy clients that
do not support ECDSA certificates, you can provide RSA-2048 certificates
in addition to ECDSA P-256 certificates.
If you have specific compliance requirements that require you to use
larger key sizes or particular key types, ECDSA P-384, RSA-2048, RSA-3072,
and RSA-4096 keys can be used.
Why choose ECDSA over RSA
The primary advantage of ECDSA lies in its ability to provide an equivalent
cryptographic security level with significantly smaller keys compared to RSA.
This efficiency translates into tangible performance and resource benefits. A
smaller key does not imply weaker security—ECDSA is based on the elliptic
curve discrete logarithm problem, which provides stronger security per unit of
key, and in some cases better computational efficiency compared to RSA.
For example:
A 256-bit ECDSA key provides a similar security level to an RSA-3072 key.
A 384-bit ECDSA key provides a greater security level than any
widely-supported RSA key size.
Key benefits of ECDSA:
Performance : ECDSA signing operations are significantly less
computationally intensive than RSA operations providing an equivalent security
level. This reduces CPU load and latency, which is crucial for high-throughput
or latency-sensitive systems.
Efficiency : smaller keys and signatures require less bandwidth and
storage, which is especially beneficial for resource-constrained environments
like mobile and IoT devices.
Multiple SSL certificates
An Application Load Balancer or proxy Network Load Balancer can host two or more SSL
certificates simultaneously when its target proxy is configured using a
supported certificate configuration method . As a best practice,
use Certificate Manager when multiple SSL certificates are needed.
For load balancers that support Compute Engine SSL certificates :
the load balancer's target proxy can reference up to 15 Compute Engine
SSL certificates. The first referenced Compute Engine SSL certificate
resource is the default (primary) certificate for the target proxy.
For load balancers that support a Certificate Manager certificate
map : the load balancer's target proxy references a single certificate map.
The certificate map supports thousands of certificate map entries. You can
configure which certificate entry is the default (primary) certificate for
the certificate map .
For load balancers that support directly referencing
Certificate Manager certificates : the load balancer's target proxy
can reference up to 100 Certificate Manager certificates. The first
referenced Certificate Manager SSL certificate resource is the
default (primary) certificate for the target proxy.
For more information, see:
Target proxies and SSL
certificates in the load
balancing documentation.
Resource quotas and
limits in the
Certificate Manager documentation.
Certificate selection process
The following certificate selection process applies to load balancers whose
target proxies reference multiple Compute Engine SSL certificates or
multiple Certificate Manager certificates.
The certificate selection process is different if a load balancer's
target proxy references a Certificate Manager certificate map. For
details about the certificate selection process of a certificate map, see
Certificate selection
logic in the
Certificate Manager documentation.
Important: The certificate selection process doesn't consider the
notValidBefore and notValidAfter attributes. The load balancer can serve an
expired certificate if an expired certificate is configured. You can avoid this
situation by using Google-managed certificates.
After a client connects to the load balancer, the client and load balancer
negotiate a TLS session. During TLS session negotiation, the client sends the
load balancer a list of TLS ciphers it supports (in the ClientHello ). The load
balancer selects a certificate whose public key algorithm is compatible with the
client. The client can also send a server name indication (SNI) hostname to the
load balancer as part of this negotiation. SNI hostname data is sometimes used
to help the load balancer pick which certificate it should send to the client.
If the load balancer's target proxy references only one certificate, that
certificate is used, and the value of SNI hostname sent by the client isn't
relevant.
If the load balancer's target proxy references two or more certificates, the
load balancer uses the following process to select a single certificate:
If the client didn't send any SNI host name in its ClientHello , the load
balancer uses the first certificate in its certificate list.
If the client sends an SNI hostname that didn't match any certificate
common name (CN) and that doesn't match any certificate subject alternative
name (SAN), load balancer uses the first certificate in its certificate
list.
In all other situations: The load balancer selects a certificate using the
following matching process:
Matching is done by longest suffix against both the common name (CN) and
subject alternative name (SAN) certificate attributes, with a preference
for ECDSA certificates over RSA certificates.
To illustrate the matching method, consider a target proxy that
references the following two certificates:
Certificate A
CN: cats.pets.example.com
SANs: cats.pets.example.com , *.pets.example.com ,
*.example.com
Certificate B
CN: dogs.pets.example.com
SANs: dogs.pets.example.com , *.pets.example.com ,
*.example.com
Now consider the following scenarios:
If the SNI hostname sent by the client is cats.pets.example.com ,
the load balancer uses Certificate A.
If the SNI hostname sent by the client is
ferrets.pets.example.com , there's no exact match, so the load
balancer selects either Certificate A or Certificate B because
both include *.pets.example.com in their SANs list. You cannot
control which certificate is selected in this situation.
After a certificate has been selected, the load balancer sends the client that
certificate only if the selected certificate uses a public key algorithm
that is compatible with a cipher sent by the client in the ClientHello . TLS
negotiation fails if the client doesn't support a cipher suite that includes
the public key algorithm (ECDSA or RSA) of the certificate that the load
balancer selected.
