Guidelines for load testing backend services with Application Load Balancers
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
While integrating a backend service with Application Load Balancer, it's important
to measure the performance of a backend service on its own, in the absence of a
load balancer. Load testing under controlled conditions helps you assess
capacity-planning trade-offs between different dimensions of performance, such
as throughput and latency. Because careful capacity planning could still
underestimate actual demand, we recommend that you use load tests to proactively
determine how the availability of a service is affected when the system is
overloaded.
Load testing goals
A typical load test measures the externally visible behavior of the backend
service under different dimensions of load. Some of the most relevant dimensions
of this testing are as follows:
Request throughput: The number of requests served per second.
Request concurrency: The number of requests processed concurrently.
Connection throughput: The number of connections initiated by clients
per second. Most services that use Transport Layer Security (TLS) have some
network transport and TLS negotiation overhead associated with each
connection that is independent of request processing.
Connection concurrency: The number of client connections processed
concurrently.
Note: This number might be lower than the request concurrency because HTTPS
clients often reuse connections for multiple requests. Note that connections
consume system resources (such as RAM and file handles) even when they are
not serving requests.
Request latency: The total elapsed time between the beginning of the
request and the end of the response.
Error rate: How often requests cause errors, such as HTTP 5xx errors and
prematurely closed connections.
To assess the health of the server under load, a load test procedure might also
collect the following internal service metrics:
Use of system resources: System resources, such as CPU, RAM, and file
handles (sockets), are typically expressed in percentage.
The importance of these metrics differs based on how the service is
implemented. Applications experience reduced performance, shed load, or
crash when they exhaust their resources. Therefore, it becomes essential to
determine the availability of resources when a host is under heavy load.
Use of other bounded resources: Non-system resources that could be
depleted under load, such as at the application layer.
Some examples of such resources include the following:
A bounded pool of worker threads or processes.
For an application server using threads, it's common to limit the number
of worker threads operating concurrently. Thread pool size limits are useful
for preventing memory and CPU exhaustion, but default settings are often
very conservative. Limits that are too low might prevent adequate use of
system resources.
Some servers use process pools, instead of thread pools. For example, an
Apache server when set up with the Prefork Multi-Processing
Model ,
assigns one process to each client connection. So, the size limit of the
pool determines the upper bound on connection concurrency.
A service deployed as a frontend to another service that has a backend
connection pool of bounded size.
Capacity planning versus overload testing
Load-testing tools help you measure different scaling dimensions individually.
For capacity planning, determine the load threshold for the acceptable
performance in multiple dimensions. For example, instead of measuring the
absolute limit of a service request throughout, consider measuring the
following:
The request rate at which the service can serve with 99th-percentile latency
that is less than a specified number of milliseconds. The number is
specified by the SLO of the service.
The maximum request rate that doesn't cause system resource utilization to exceed
optimal levels. Note that the optimal utilization varies by application and
could be significantly less than 100%. For example, at 80% peak memory
utilization, the application might be able to handle minor load spikes
better than if the peak utilization were at 99%.
While it's important to use load test results to form capacity planning
decisions, it's equally important to understand how a service behaves when load
exceeds capacity. Some server behaviors that are often evaluated using overload
tests are as follows:
Load-shedding: When a service receives excessive incoming requests or
connections, it could respond by slowing down all requests, or by rejecting
some requests to maintain acceptable performance for the remaining ones. We
recommend the latter approach to prevent client timeouts before receiving a
response and to reduce the risk of memory exhaustion by lowering request
concurrency on the server.
Resilience against resource exhaustion: A service generally avoids crashing
from resource exhaustion because it's difficult for pending requests to
make further progress if the service has crashed. If a backend service has
many instances, the robustness of individual instances is vital for overall
availability of the service. While an instance restarts from a crash, other
instances might experience more load, potentially causing cascade failure.
General testing guidelines
While defining your test cases, consider the following guidelines.
Note: The guidelines listed in this section are not applicable to every service,
and the list is not exhaustive. For more information, see the best benchmarking
practices
page maintained by the Envoy project. The page contains many suggestions that
are relevant to load testing of any HTTPS service.
Create small-scale tests
Create small-scale tests to measure the performance limits of the server. With
excessive server capacity, there's a risk that a test won't reveal the
performance limits of the service itself, but might uncover bottlenecks in other
systems, such as the client hosts or the network layer.
For best results, consider a test case that uses a single virtual machine (VM)
instance or a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Pod to independently test the service. To
achieve full load on the server, if necessary, you can use multiple VMs, but
remember they can complicate the collection of performance data.
Choose open-loop load patterns
Most load generators use the closed-loop pattern to limit the number of
concurrent requests and delay new requests until the previous ones are complete.
We don't recommend this approach because production clients of the service might
not exhibit such throttling behavior.
In contrast, the open-loop pattern enables load generators to simulate the
production load by sending requests at a steady rate, independent of the rate at
which server responses arrive.
Run tests using recommended load generators
We recommend the following load generators for the load testing of the backend
service:
Nighthawk
Nighthawk is an
open-source tool developed in coordination with the Envoy project. You can use
it to generate client load, visualize
benchmarks ,
and measure server performance for most load-testing scenarios of HTTPS
services.
Test HTTP/1
To test HTTP/1, use the following command:
nighthawk_client URI \
--duration DURATION \
--open-loop \
--no-default-failure-predicates \
--protocol http1 \
--request-body-size REQ_BODY_SIZE \
--concurrency CONCURRENCY \
--rps RPS \
--connections CONNECTIONS
Replace the following:
URI : the URI to benchmark
DURATION : total test run time in seconds
REQ_BODY_SIZE : size of the POST payload in each
request
CONCURRENCY : the total number of concurrent event
loops
This number should match the core count of the client VM
RPS : the target rate of requests per second, per
event loop
CONNECTIONS : the number of concurrent connections,
per event loop
Note: The no-default-failure-predicates flag is new. Use the latest Nighthawk
build to test it.
See the following example:
nighthawk_client http://10.20.30.40:80 \
--duration 600 --open-loop --no-default-failure-predicates \
--protocol http1 --request-body-size 5000 \
--concurrency 16 --rps 500 --connections 200
The output of each test run provides a histogram of response latencies. In the
example from the Nighthawk
documentation
, notice that the 99th-percentile latency is approximately 135 microseconds.

Test HTTP/2
To test HTTP/2, use the following command:
nighthawk_client URI \
--duration DURATION \
--open-loop \
--no-default-failure-predicates \
--protocol http2 \
--request-body-size REQ_BODY_SIZE \
--concurrency CONCURRENCY \
--rps RPS \
--max-active-requests MAX_ACTIVE_REQUESTS \
--max-concurrent-streams MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS
Replace the following:
URI : the URI to benchmark
DURATION : total test run time in seconds
REQ_BODY_SIZE : size of the POST payload in each
request
CONCURRENCY : the total number of concurrent event
loops
This number should match the core count of the client VM
RPS : the target rate of requests per second for each
event loop
MAX_ACTIVE_REQUESTS : the maximum number of
concurrent active requests for each event loop
MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS : the maximum number of
concurrent streams allowed on each HTTP/2 connection
See the following example:
nighthawk_client http://10.20.30.40:80 \
--duration 600 --open-loop --no-default-failure-predicates \
--protocol http2 --request-body-size 5000 \
--concurrency 16 --rps 500 \
--max-active-requests 200 --max-concurrent-streams 1
ab (Apache benchmark tool)
ab
is a less flexible alternative to Nighthawk, but it's available as a package on
almost every Linux distribution. ab is only recommended for quick and simple
tests.
To install ab , use the following command:
On Debian and Ubuntu, run sudo apt-get install apache2-utils .
On RedHat-based distributions, run sudo yum install httpd-utils .
After you've installed ab , use the following command to run it:
ab -c CONCURRENCY \
-n NUM_REQUESTS \
-t TIMELIMIT \
-p POST_FILE URI
Replace the following:
CONCURRENCY : number of concurrent requests to
perform
NUM_REQUESTS : number of requests to perform
TIMELIMIT : maximum number of seconds to spend on
requests
POST_FILE : local file containing the HTTP POST
payload
URI : the URI to benchmark
See the following example:
ab -c 200 -n 1000000 -t 600 -p body http://10.20.30.40:80
The command in the preceding example sends requests with a concurrency of 200
(closed-loop pattern), and stops after either 1,000,000 (one million) requests
or 600 seconds of elapsed time. The command also includes the contents of the
file body as an HTTP POST payload.
The ab command produces response latency histograms similar to those as
Nighthawk, but its resolution is limited to milliseconds, instead of
microseconds:
Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
50% 7
66% 7
75% 7
80% 7
90% 92
95% 121
98% 123
99% 127
100% 156 (longest request)
