Use health checks
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud provides health checking mechanisms that
determine whether backend instances respond properly to traffic. This document
describes how to create and use health checks for load
balancers and Cloud Service Mesh.
This page assumes that you are familiar with the following concepts:
Health checks overview
Backend services overview
VPC firewall rules
Note: The term health check does not refer to legacy health checks. In this
document, legacy health checks are explicitly called legacy health checks .
Create health checks
Google Cloud lets you create or select a health check when you
complete the load balancer's backend configuration in the Google Cloud console.
You can also create a health check independently of load balancer configuration
in the Google Cloud console. This is useful if you need to create your
health check first, or if you need to use a health check for multiple load
balancers. You can create a health check using the Google Cloud console,
the Google Cloud CLI, or the REST APIs.
Note: You must use legacy HTTP health checks for target pool
based-regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers. For details, see legacy health
checks . Backend service-based
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers use the
non-legacy health checks described in this section.
Console
Go to the Health checks page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Health checks page
Click Create a health check .
On the Create a health check page, supply the following information:
Name : Provide a name for the health check.
Description : Optionally, provide a description.
Scope : Select a scope, either Global or Regional ,
depending on the type of load balancer .
If you selected Regional , pick a Region from the drop-down.
Protocol : Choose a health check
protocol .
Port : Provide a port number. When you create a health check in
the Google Cloud console, you must specify the
port using a port number.
Proxy protocol : Optionally, you can append a proxy header to the
requests made by the health check probe systems.
Request path and Response : For HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP2 protocols,
you can optionally provide a URL path for the health check probe
systems to contact. For more
information, see Additional flags for HTTP, HTTPS, and
HTTP/2 health checks .
Request and Response : For TCP and SSL protcols, you can
specify an ASCII text string to send and expected text response
string. For more information, see Additional flags for SSL and TCP health
checks .
Check interval : Define the amount of time from the start of one
probe to the start of the next one.
Timeout : Define the amount of time that Google Cloud
waits for a response to a probe. Its value must be less than or equal
to the check interval.
Healthy threshold : Define the number of sequential probes that
must succeed for the VM instance to be considered healthy.
Unhealthy threshold : Define the number of sequential probes that
must fail for the VM instance to be considered unhealthy.
Click Create .
gcloud
To create a global health check, use the appropriate compute
health-checks create
command:
gcloud compute health-checks create PROTOCOL NAME \
--global \
--description= DESCRIPTION \
--check-interval= CHECK_INTERVAL \
--timeout= TIMEOUT \
--healthy-threshold= HEALTHY_THRESHOLD \
--unhealthy-threshold= UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD \
PORT_SPECIFICATION \
ADDITIONAL_FLAGS
To create a regional health check, use the appropriate compute
health-checks create
command:
gcloud compute health-checks create PROTOCOL NAME \
--region= REGION \
--description= DESCRIPTION \
--check-interval= CHECK_INTERVAL \
--timeout= TIMEOUT \
--healthy-threshold= HEALTHY_THRESHOLD \
--unhealthy-threshold= UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD \
PORT_SPECIFICATION \
ADDITIONAL_FLAGS
Replace the following:
PROTOCOL defines the protocol used for the health
check. Valid options are GRPC , GRPC_WITH_TLS , HTTP , HTTPS ,
HTTP2 , SSL , and TCP .
NAME is the name of the health check. Within a given
project: Each global health check must have a unique name, and regional
health checks must have unique names within a given region.
REGION : The region of the health check. For regional
load balancers, the health check region must match the region of the
backend service.
DESCRIPTION is an optional description.
CHECK_INTERVAL is the amount of time from the start of
one health check probe system's connection to the start of the next one.
Units are seconds. If omitted, Google Cloud uses a value of 5s (5
seconds).
TIMEOUT is the amount of time that Google Cloud
waits for a response to a probe. The value of TIMEOUT
must be less than or equal to the CHECK_INTERVAL . Units
are seconds. If omitted,
Google Cloud uses a value of 5s (5 seconds).
HEALTHY_THRESHOLD and
UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD specify the number of sequential
probes that must succeed or fail for the VM instance to be considered
healthy or unhealthy. If either is omitted,
Google Cloud uses a default threshold of 2 .
PORT_SPECIFICATION : Defines the port specification
using one of the Port specification flags .
ADDITIONAL_FLAGS are other flags for specifying ports
and options specific to the PROTOCOL . See Additional
flags for HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 health
checks , Additional flags for SSL and
TCP health checks , or Additional
flag for gRPC health checks .
Terraform
To create a global health check, use the
google_compute_health_check resource.
resource "google_compute_health_check" "health_check_tcp_with_logging" {
provider = google-beta
name = "health-check-tcp"
timeout_sec = 1
check_interval_sec = 1
tcp_health_check {
port = "22"
}
log_config {
enable = true
}
}
To create a regional health check, use the
google_compute_region_health_check resource.
resource "google_compute_region_health_check" "default" {
name = "tcp-health-check-region-west"
timeout_sec = 5
check_interval_sec = 5
tcp_health_check {
port = "80"
}
region = "us-west1"
}
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see
Basic Terraform commands .
API
To create a global health check, use
healthChecks.insert
To create a regional health check, use
regionHealthChecks.insert
Modify health checks
You cannot convert a health check to a legacy health check (or the reverse) by
modifying the health check. You also cannot change a health check's name or
scope (for example, global to regional).
Console
Go to the Health checks page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Health checks page
Click a health check to view its details.
If you need to modify the health check, click Edit , then:
Make changes to the parameters as necessary.
Click Save .
gcloud
Identify the name and scope of the health check. For instructions, see
List health checks .
Except for a health check's name, protocol, and scope, you can modify any
of the common flags , the port specification
flags , and other additional flags.
To modify an existing health check, use the appropriate compute
health-checks update
command command.
For flags that you omit, preconfigured settings are preserved.
Example modification of a global health check: The following command
modifies a global HTTP health check named hc-http-port-80 by
changing its check interval, timeout, and request path:
gcloud compute health-checks update http hc-http-port-80 \
--global \
--check-interval=20s \
--timeout=15s \
--request-path="/health"
Example modification of a regional health check: The following command
modifies a regional TCP health check in us-west1 named
hc-west1-tcp-ldap by changing its port specification:
gcloud compute health-checks update tcp hc-west1-tcp-ldap \
--region=us-west1 \
--port=631
API
Identify the name and scope of the health check. See Listing
health checks for instructions.
Except for a health check's name, protocol, and scope, you can modify any
of the common flags , the port specification
flags , and other additional flags
with these API calls. Use patch API calls to preserve any preconfigured
settings that are not explicitly set in the request.
To modify a global health check, use either
healthChecks.update
or
healthChecks.patch .
To modify a regional health check, use either
regionHealthChecks.update
or
regionHealthChecks.patch .
List health checks
Console
Note: The Google Cloud console lists both health checks and legacy
health checks on its health checks page.
Go to the Health checks page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Health checks page
Click a health check to view its details.
gcloud
To list health checks, use the compute health-checks
list command:
To list global health checks:
gcloud compute health-checks list \
--global
To list regional health checks: Replace REGION_LIST with a
comma-delimited list of Google Cloud regions to query.
gcloud compute health-checks list \
--regions= REGION_LIST
After you know the name and scope of a health check, use the compute
health-checks
describe command to
view its current configuration.
To describe a global health check, replace NAME with its name.
gcloud compute health-checks describe NAME \
--global
To describe a regional health check, replace NAME with its
name and REGION with its region.
gcloud compute health-checks describe NAME \
--region= REGION
API
To list health checks, use these API calls:
To list global health checks: healthChecks.list
To list regional health checks: regionHealthChecks.list
To describe a health check's current configuration, use:
To describe a global health check: healthChecks.get
To describe a regional health check: regionHealthChecks.get
Additional flags
This section describes additional flags you can use when creating or modifying
a health check. Some flags, such as port specification, must be set by using
gcloud or the API.
Port specification flags
If you create a health check by using the Google Cloud CLI or the API,
you have two options to specify the health check's port. The following table
shows port specification options for valid load balancer and backend
combinations. The term instance group refers to unmanaged instance groups,
zonal managed instance groups, or regional managed instance groups.
Each health check can only use one type of port specification.
Product
Backend type
Port specification options
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer
Instance groups and supported NEGs
--port : Specify a TCP port by number, from 1
to 65535
The --use-serving-port flag is ignored for a health
check associated with an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer because backend services for this
load balancer don't subscribe to any named ports .
This is because they are passthrough load balancers that deliver packets
directly to backends instead of creating new connections from the load
balancer to the backend.
Target pools
Legacy health checks which support the port number ( --port )
specification.
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
Instance groups and supported NEGs
--port : Specify a TCP port by number, from 1
to 65535
The --use-serving-port flag is ignored for a health
check associated with an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer because backend services for this
load balancer don't subscribe to any named ports .
This is because they are passthrough load balancers that deliver packets
directly to backends instead of creating new connections from the load
balancer to the backend.
Global external Application Load Balancer
Classic Application Load Balancer
Regional external Application Load Balancer
Cross-region internal Application Load Balancer
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Global external proxy Network Load Balancer
Classic proxy Network Load Balancer
Regional external proxy Network Load Balancer
Cross-region internal proxy Network Load Balancer
Regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer
Cloud Service Mesh
Supported NEGs
--port : Specify a TCP port by number, from 1
to 65535
--use-serving-port : Use the port of each endpoint in the
network endpoint group.
Instance groups
--port : Specify a TCP port by number, from 1
to 65535
--use-serving-port : Use the same instance group named port
to which the backend service subscribes.
If you omit the port specification while creating the health check,
Google Cloud uses the following defaults:
If the health check's protocol is TCP or HTTP , it uses --port=80 .
If the health check's protocol is SSL , HTTPS , or HTTP2 , it uses
--port=443 .
If the health check's protocol is GRPC or GRPC_WITH_TLS , there is no
implied default; you must include the port specification.
Additional flags for HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 health checks
In addition to the common flags and port specification, you can use the
following optional flags for HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 health checks. This example
creates an HTTP health check named hc-http-port-80 using port 80 with default
interval, timeout, and health threshold criteria.
gcloud compute health-checks create HTTP_PROTOCOL hc-http-port-80 \
COMMON_FLAGS \
PORT_SPECIFICATION \
--host= HOST \
--proxy-header= PROXY_HEADER \
--request-path= REQUEST_PATH \
--response= RESPONSE
HTTP_PROTOCOL : Can be http (HTTP/1.1 without TLS), https
(HTTP/1.1 with TLS), or http2 (HTTP/2 with TLS).
COMMON_FLAGS : Defines the common flags. See Creation
procedure .
PORT_SPECIFICATION : Defines the port specification using one of
the Port specification flags .
HOST lets you provide a Host HTTP header. If omitted, the IP
address of the load balancer's forwarding rule is used.
PROXY_HEADER must be one of NONE or PROXY_V1 . If omitted,
Google Cloud uses NONE . The value of PROXY_V1 adds the header
PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n .
REQUEST_PATH specifies the URL path that Google Cloud uses
when sending health check requests. If omitted, the health check request is
sent to / .
RESPONSE defines an optional expected response. Response strings
must follow these rules:
The response string must consist of ASCII letters, numbers, and spaces.
The response string can be up to 1,024 characters long.
Wildcard matching is not supported.
Content-based checking does not support inversion; for example, operators
such as ! in HAProxy are not supported.
If Google Cloud finds the expected response string anywhere in the
first 1,024 bytes of the received response body, and if the HTTP status is
200 (OK), the probe is considered successful.
The --request-path and --response flags modify the success criteria for the
health check probe .
Additional flags for SSL and TCP health checks
In addition to the common flags and port specification, you can use the
following optional flags for SSL and TCP health checks. This example creates a
TCP health check named hc-tcp-3268 using port 3268 with default interval,
timeout, and health threshold criteria.
gcloud compute health-checks create tcp hc-tcp-3268 \
COMMON_FLAGS \
PORT_SPECIFICATION \
--proxy-header= PROXY_HEADER \
--request= REQUEST_STRING \
--response= RESPONSE_STRING
The protocol can be tcp (in this example) or ssl .
COMMON_FLAGS : Defines the common flags. See Creation
procedure .
PORT_SPECIFICATION : Defines the port specification using one of
the Port specification flags .
PROXY_HEADER must be one of NONE or PROXY_V1 . If omitted,
Google Cloud uses NONE . The value of PROXY_V1 adds the header
PROXY UNKNOWN\r\n .
REQUEST_STRING : You can provide a string, up to 1,024 ASCII
characters long, to send once the TCP or SSL session has been established.
RESPONSE_STRING : You can provide a string, up to 1,024 ASCII
characters long, for the expected response.
The --request and --response flags modify the success criteria for the
health check probe . If you use
the --response flag, either by itself or in conjunction with the --request
flag, the response returned must exactly match the expected response string.
Additional flag for gRPC health checks
Your backend gRPC server must implement the gRPC health service as described in
the gRPC health checking protocol .
Google Cloud sends a HealthCheckRequest message to your backends by
calling the Check method of the health service on your backend. The service
parameter in the request is set to an empty string unless a gRPC service name is
specified.
A gRPC health check can check the status of a gRPC service. You can include a
string, up to 1,024 ASCII characters long, that is the name of a particular
gRPC service running on a backend VM or NEG. To do this, use the following
optional flag for gRPC health checks:
--grpc-service-name= GRPC_SERVICE_NAME
For example, you might have the following services and status that the backend
server registers with your backend's gRPC Health service.
MyPackage.ServiceA with the serving status SERVING
MyPackage.ServiceB with the serving status NOT_SERVING
Empty service name with the serving status NOT_SERVING
If you create a health check against MyPackage.ServiceA , as follows, the
health check probe returns HEALTHY , because the service's status is SERVING .
gcloud compute health-checks create grpc MyGrpcHealthCheckServiceA \
--grpc-service-name=MyPackage.ServiceA
If you create a health check against MyPackage.ServiceB , the
health check probe returns UNHEALTHY because the service's status is
NOT_SERVING .
If you create a health check against MyPackage.ServiceC , which is not
registered with the gRPC Health service, the health check probe returns the
gRPC status NOT_FOUND , which is the equivalent of UNHEALTHY .
If you create a health check against the empty service name, the health check
probe returns the status UNHEALTHY , because the empty service name is
registered with the status NOT_SERVING .
Legacy health checks
This section describes how to create, modify, and list legacy HTTP and HTTPS
health checks. You cannot convert a legacy health check to a health check, and
you cannot convert a health check to a legacy health check.
To learn which types of load balancers support legacy health checks, see the
Load balancer guide .
Create legacy health checks
Console
Although the Google Cloud console's health checks page lists and lets you
edit both health checks and legacy health checks, you cannot
create a new legacy health check from the Google Cloud console's health
checks page.
You can create a legacy health check in the Google Cloud console
only while creating a target pool-based
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer .
To create the legacy health check by itself, use this section's gcloud
or API instructions.
gcloud
To create a legacy health check, use the compute http-health-checks
create
command:
gcloud compute LEGACY_CHECK_TYPE create NAME \
--description= DESCRIPTION \
--check-interval= CHECK_INTERVAL \
--timeout= TIMEOUT \
--healthy-threshold= HEALTHY_THRESHOLD \
--unhealthy-threshold= UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD \
--host= HOST \
--port= PORT \
--request-path= REQUEST_PATH
Replace the following:
LEGACY_CHECK_TYPE is http-health-checks for a legacy HTTP
health check or https-health-checks for a legacy HTTPS health check. If
you are creating the legacy health check for a target pool-based
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer, you must use http-health-checks .
NAME is the name of the legacy health check.
Within a given project, each legacy health check must have a unique name.
DESCRIPTION is an optional description.
CHECK_INTERVAL is the amount of time from the start of one
probe to the start of the next one. Units are seconds. If omitted,
Google Cloud uses a value of 5s (5 seconds).
TIMEOUT is the amount of time that Google Cloud will
wait for a response to a probe. The value of TIMEOUT must be
less than or equal to the CHECK_INTERVAL . Units are seconds. If
omitted, Google Cloud uses a value of 5s (5 seconds).
HEALTHY_THRESHOLD and UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD specify
the number of sequential probes that must succeed or fail for a VM
instance to be considered healthy or unhealthy. If either is omitted,
Google Cloud uses a default threshold of 2 .
HOST lets you provide a host HTTP header. If omitted, the
IP address of the load balancer's forwarding rule is used.
PORT lets you provide a port number. If omitted,
Google Cloud uses 80 .
REQUEST_PATH specifies the URL path that Google Cloud
uses when sending health check requests. If omitted, the health check
request is sent to / .
API
To create a legacy HTTP health check, use the httpHealthChecks.insert
API call.
To create a legacy HTTPS health check, use the httpsHealthChecks.insert
Terraform
To create a legacy HTTP health check resource, use the google_compute_http_health_check resource.
To create a legacy HTTPS health check resource, use the google_compute_https_health_check resource.
Modify legacy health checks
Console
Go to the Health checks page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Health checks page
Click a health check to view its details.
Click Edit edit , make changes, and then click Save .
gcloud
To modify a legacy HTTP health check, use the compute http-health-checks
update
command, replacing NAME with its name. When modifying a legacy
health check with gcloud , preconfigured settings for flags you omit are
preserved. The OTHER_OPTIONS are the options described in
creating a legacy health check .
gcloud compute http-health-checks update NAME \
OTHER_OPTIONS
To modify a legacy HTTPS health check, use the compute https-health-checks
update
command, replacing NAME with its name. When modifying a legacy
health check with gcloud , preconfigured settings for flags you omit are
preserved. The OTHER_OPTIONS are the options described in
creating a legacy health check .
gcloud compute https-health-checks update NAME \
OTHER_OPTIONS
API
Except for a legacy health check's name and type, you can modify any of
the flags used for its creation . The patch
API calls preserve any preconfigured settings that are not explicitly set in
the patch request.
To modify a legacy HTTP health check, use either
httpHealthChecks.update
or
httpHealthChecks.patch .
To modify a legacy HTTPS health check, use either
httpsHealthChecks.update
or
httpsHealthChecks.patch .
List legacy health checks
Console
Go to the Health checks page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Health checks page
Click a legacy health check to view its details.
gcloud
To list legacy HTTP health checks, use the compute http-health-checks
list command:
gcloud compute http-health-checks list
To list legacy HTTPS health checks, use the compute https-health-checks
list command:
gcloud compute https-health-checks list
To describe a legacy HTTP health check, use the compute
http-health-checks
describe
command, replacing NAME with its name.
gcloud compute http-health-checks describe NAME
To describe a legacy HTTPS health check, use the compute
https-health-checks
describe
command, replacing NAME with its name.
gcloud compute https-health-checks describe NAME
API
To list legacy health checks:
Use httpHealthChecks.list
to list legacy HTTP health checks.
Use httpsHealthChecks.list
to list legacy HTTPS health checks.
To describe a legacy health check:
Use httpHealthChecks.get
to describe legacy HTTP health check.
Use httpsHealthChecks.get
to describe legacy HTTPS health check.
Create required firewall rules
You need to create ingress firewall rules applicable to all VMs being load
balanced to allow traffic from health check prober IP
ranges . The following
example creates a firewall rule that is applicable to VM instances identified by
a specific target tag.
This example allows all TCP traffic from Google Cloud health
check systems to your VM instances. (TCP traffic includes SSL, HTTP, HTTPS, and
HTTP/2 traffic.) If you prefer, you can specify ports along with the TCP
protocol; however, if you specify ports, your firewall rules might become
specific to a particular health check. If you use tcp:80 for the protocol and
port, this allows TCP traffic on port 80, so Google Cloud could contact
your VMs using HTTP on port 80, but it couldn't contact them using HTTPS on
port 443.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Firewall policies page.
Go to Firewall policies
Click Create firewall rule .
On the Create a firewall rule page, supply the following information:
Name : Provide a name for the rule. For this example, use
fw-allow-health-checks .
Network : Choose a VPC network.
Priority : Enter a number for the priority. Lower numbers have
higher priorities. Be sure that the firewall rule has a higher
priority than other rules that might deny ingress traffic.
Direction of traffic : Choose ingress .
Action on match : Choose allow .
Targets : Choose Specified target tags , and then enter tags in
the Target tags field. For this example, use
allow-health-checks .
Source filter : Choose IP ranges .
Source IP ranges : Enter the source IP range depending on your
load balancer type, traffic type, and health check type. See Probe IP
ranges and firewall rules .
Allowed protocols and ports : Use tcp and the port configured in
your health check. TCP is the underlying protocol for all health check
protocols.
Click Create .
On each of your instances being load balanced, add the network
tag
so that this new ingress firewall rule applies to them. This example
uses allow-health-checks for the network tag.
gcloud
Use the following gcloud command to create a firewall rule named
fw-allow-health-checks that lets incoming TCP connections, from
Google Cloud health check systems, to instances in your
VPC network with the allow-health-checks tag.
Based on the load balancer type, a different set of
probe IP ranges and firewall rules
is supported for IPv6 traffic to the backends.
Replace NETWORK_NAME with the name of your
VPC network and replace PORT with the
ports used by your load balancer.
gcloud compute firewall-rules create fw-allow-health-checks \
--network= NETWORK_NAME \
--action=ALLOW \
--direction=INGRESS \
--source-ranges= SOURCE_IP_RANGE \
--target-tags=allow-health-checks \
--rules=tcp: PORT
The value for SOURCE_IP_RANGE depends on your
load balancer type, traffic type, and health check type. See Probe IP
ranges and firewall rules .
On each of your instances being load balanced, add the network
tag
so that this new ingress firewall rule applies to them. This example
uses allow-health-checks for the network tag.
Refer to the gcloud firewall rules
documentation and the API
documentation for more details.
Related documentation:
For more information about specifying targets for firewall rules, see the
explanation of targets in the Firewall
Rules overview and Configuring network
tags .

see Firewall rules .
Associate health checks with load balancers
If you haven't already done so, review the Health checks overview: Select a
health check .
To associate a health check with a new load balancer, refer to the setup guide
for the respective load balancer. This section describes how to associate a
health check with an existing load balancer's backend service.
This section assumes that you have already:
Created a load balancer.
Created a health check .
Created the required firewall rule .
Console
To associate a health check with an existing load balancer:
Go to the Load balancing page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Load balancing page
Click a load balancer to view its details.
Click Edit edit , and then click Backend configuration .
Choose a health check from the Health check menu.
Click Update .
gcloud
To associate a health check with an existing backend service, follow these
steps.
Identify the name and scope of the backend service. The
passthrough Network Load Balancers andproxy Network Load Balancers have only one backend service per
load balancer. The Application Load Balancers have one or more backend
services associated with a single URL map.
To list backend services for internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, run the following
command.
gcloud compute backend-services list \
--region= REGION \
--filter="loadBalancingScheme=INTERNAL"
To list backend services for regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers, run the following
command.
gcloud compute backend-services list \
--region= REGION \
--filter="loadBalancingScheme=EXTERNAL"
To list backend services for global external proxy Network Load Balancers, run the following
command.
gcloud compute backend-services list \
--global \
--filter="loadBalancingScheme=EXTERNAL_MANAGED" \
--filter="protocol=(SSL,TCP)"
To list backend services for classic proxy Network Load Balancers, run the
following command.
gcloud compute backend-services list \
--global \
--filter="loadBalancingScheme=EXTERNAL" \
--filter="protocol=(SSL,TCP)"
To list backend services for cross-region internal proxy Network Load Balancers, run the
following command.
gcloud compute backend-services list \
--global \
--filter="loadBalancingScheme=INTERNAL_MANAGED" \
--filter="protocol=(SSL,TCP)"
To list backend services for regional external proxy Network Load Balancers, run the
following command.
gcloud compute backend-services list \
--region= REGION \
--filter="loadBalancingScheme=EXTERNAL_MANAGED" \
--filter="protocol=(SSL,TCP)"
To list backend services for regional internal proxy Network Load Balancers, run the
following command.
gcloud compute backend-services list \
--region= REGION \
--filter="loadBalancingScheme=INTERNAL_MANAGED" \
--filter="protocol=(SSL,TCP)"
To identify backend services for global external Application Load Balancers,
classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal Application Load Balancers, first
identify a URL map, and then describe the map. URL maps and backend
services for these load balancers are always global, regardless of the
Network Service Tier. Replace URL_MAP_NAME with the
name of the URL map. The backend services used by the load balancer
are listed in the response.
gcloud compute url-maps list \
--global
gcloud compute url-maps describe URL_MAP_NAME \
--global
To identify backend services for either a regional external Application Load Balancer or
a regional internal Application Load Balancer, first identify a URL map, and then describe the
map. Both URL maps and backend services for these load balancers are regional.
Replace REGION_LIST with a comma-delimited list of
Google Cloud regions to query. Replace
URL_MAP_NAME with the name of the URL map and
REGION with its region. The backend services used
by the load balancer are listed in the response.
gcloud compute url-maps list \
--regions= REGION_LIST
gcloud compute url-maps describe URL_MAP_NAME \
--region= REGION
Identify a health check. See Listing health checks .
Associate a health check with the backend service by using the compute
backend-services
update command.
Each backend service must reference a single health check. In the
following commands, replace BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME with the name
of the backend service, HEALTH_CHECK_NAME with the name of the
health check, and, if necessary REGION with the
Google Cloud region of the backend service, the health check, or
both.
To change the health check for an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer: An
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer's backend service is regional. It can reference a
global or regional health check. The following example shows a
regional health check reference. If you're using a global health check
with your internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, use --global-health-checks instead of
--health-checks-region .
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--health-checks= HEALTH_CHECK_NAME \
--health-checks-region= REGION
To change the health check for a backend service-based
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer: A regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer's backend service is
regional. It can reference a regional health check.
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--health-checks= HEALTH_CHECK_NAME \
--health-checks-region= REGION
To change the health check for a global external proxy Network Load Balancer,
classic proxy Network Load Balancer, global external Application Load Balancer, classic Application Load Balancer,
or a cross-region internal Application Load Balancer: Both the backend
service and health check are global for these load balancers.
Application Load Balancers can reference more than
one health check if it references more than one backend service.
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--global \
--health-checks HEALTH_CHECK_NAME \
--global-health-checks
To change the health check for either a regional external Application Load Balancer,
a regional external proxy Network Load Balancer, a regional internal Application Load Balancer, or a
regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer: Both the backend
service and health check are regional. Some load balancers might
reference more than one health check if they can reference more than one
backend service.
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--health-checks= HEALTH_CHECK_NAME \
--health-checks-region= REGION
API
You can list backend services with the
backendServices.list
API call.
View health checks .
To associate a health check with a backend service, use one of these API
calls:
backendServices.update
backendServices.patch
Associate legacy health checks with target pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers
To associate a legacy health check with a new regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer, refer to Set up
a regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer with a target
pool . This section describes
how to associate a legacy health check with a target pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer.
This section assumes that you have already:
Created a target pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer.
Created a legacy health check .
Created the required firewall rule .
Console
To associate a health check with an existing target pool-based
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer:
Go to the Load balancing page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Load balancing page
Click a load balancer to view its details.
Click Edit edit , and then click Backend configuration .
Choose a legacy health check from the Health check menu. (Only
eligible legacy health checks are shown.)
Click Update .
gcloud
To associate a health check with an existing target pool-based
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer:
Identify the target pool(s). A regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer has at least one
target pool, and might have a secondary backup pool.
gcloud compute target-pools list
Identify a legacy health check using the HTTP protocol. View legacy
health checks if necessary.
Associate the legacy health check with the target pool(s). In the
following commands, replace TARGET_POOL_NAME with the name of
the target pool, REGION with its region, and
LEGACY_CHECK_NAME with the name of the legacy health
check. The legacy health check must use the HTTP protocol.
To remove a legacy HTTP health check from a target pool:
gcloud compute target-pools remove-health-checks TARGET_POOL_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--http-health-check LEGACY_CHECK_NAME
To add a legacy HTTP health check to a target pool:
gcloud compute target-pools add-health-checks TARGET_POOL_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--http-health-check LEGACY_CHECK_NAME
API
You can list target pools with the
targetPools.list
API call.
View legacy health checks
and identify a legacy HTTP health check.
To associate a legacy HTTP health check with a target pool use the API
call targetPools.addHealthCheck .
Check health check status
After you associate a health check with a backend service or a target pool, you
can get the instantaneous health check state for the load balancer's backends.
Console
Go to the load balancing summary page.
Go to the Load balancing
page
Click the name of a load balancer.
Under Backend , inspect the Healthy column. Health status is
reported for each backend instance group or network endpoint group.
gcloud
For all load balancers except target pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers,
identify the name and scope (global or regional) of the backend service.
For a complete list of load balancers and scopes, see Backend
services .
Use the compute backend-services
get-health
command, replacing NAME with the name of the backend service,
and REGION with its region, if required.
To get the instantaneous health state of a global backend service:
gcloud compute backend-services get-health GLOBAL_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--global
To get the instantaneous health state of a regional backend service:
gcloud compute backend-services get-health REGIONAL_BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--region= REGION
For target pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers, identify the name
and region of the load balancer's target pool, and then use
the compute target-pools
get-health
command, replacing NAME with the name of the target pool,
and REGION with its region.
gcloud compute target-pools get-health TARGET_POOL_NAME \
--region= REGION
API
For all load balancers except target pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers,
identify the name and scope (global or regional) of the backend service.
For a complete list of load balancers and scopes, see Backend
services .
To get the instantaneous health state of a global backend service, use
backendServices.getHealth
To get the instantaneous health state of a regional backend service,
use
