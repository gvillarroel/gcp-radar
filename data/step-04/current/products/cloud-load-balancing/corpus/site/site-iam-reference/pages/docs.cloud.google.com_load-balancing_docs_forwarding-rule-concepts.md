Forwarding rules overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A forwarding rule specifies how to route network traffic to the backend services
of a load balancer. A forwarding rule includes an IP address, an IP protocol,
and one or more ports on which the load balancer accepts traffic. Some
Google Cloud load balancers limit you to a predefined set of
ports , and others let you specify arbitrary ports.
A forwarding rule and its corresponding IP address represent the frontend
configuration of a Google Cloud load balancer.
Depending on the load balancer type, the following is true:
Forwarding rules specify either a
backend service ,
target proxy , or
target pool .
Forwarding rules and their IP addresses are either internal or external.
Forwarding rules are either
global or
regional ,
depending on the load balancer and its network tier .
In addition, global and regional forwarding rules can be designated as services
in App Hub applications .
Note: Forwarding rules are also used for protocol
forwarding ,
Classic VPN gateways , and
Cloud Service Mesh to provide forwarding
information in the control plane. This page only discusses forwarding rules in
the context of Google Cloud load balancers.
Internal forwarding rules
Internal forwarding rules forward traffic that
originates inside a Google Cloud network. The clients can be in the same
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network as the backends, or the clients can be in a
connected network.
Internal forwarding rules are used by the following Google Cloud load
balancers:
Internal Application Load Balancer
Internal proxy Network Load Balancer
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
Internal Application Load Balancer
The internal Application Load Balancer supports IPv4 traffic using either the HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP/2
protocols.
The scope of the forwarding rule depends on the type of load balancer:
Each regional internal Application Load Balancer has at least one regional internal forwarding
rule. The regional internal forwarding rule points to the load balancer's
regional target HTTP or HTTPS proxy. The forwarding rule is associated with a
regional internal IP address.
Each cross-region internal Application Load Balancer has at least one global internal forwarding
rule. The global internal forwarding rule points to the load balancer's global
target HTTP or HTTPS proxy. The global forwarding rule is configured with a
regional internal IP address and associated with a regional subnet;
whereas, a global external Application Load Balancer has a global forwarding rule that has a
global anycast IP address.
Internal managed forwarding rules connected to a target HTTP(S) proxy support
any port number between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
As an example, the following diagram shows how a forwarding rule fits into the
regional internal Application Load Balancer architecture.

For more information about internal Application Load Balancers, see the following pages:
Internal Application Load Balancer overview

Internal Application Load Balancers and connected
networks
Internal proxy Network Load Balancer
With an internal proxy Network Load Balancer, the supported traffic type is IPv4, and the
supported protocol is TCP.
The scope of the forwarding rule depends on the type of load balancer:
Each regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer has at least one regional internal
forwarding rule. The forwarding rule specifies an internal IP address, port,
and regional target TCP proxy. Clients use the IP address and port to connect
to the load balancer's Envoy proxies—the forwarding rule's IP address is
the IP address of the load balancer (sometimes called a virtual IP address or
VIP).
Each cross-region internal proxy Network Load Balancer has at least one global internal forwarding
rule. The global internal forwarding rule points to the load balancer's global
target TCP proxy. The global forwarding rule is configured with a
regional internal IP address and associated with a regional subnet.
Internal managed forwarding rules connected to a target TCP proxy support
any port number between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
The following diagram shows how a forwarding rule fits into the
regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer architecture.

For more details about internal proxy Network Load Balancers, see the following pages:
Internal proxy Network Load Balancer
overview
Internal proxy Network Load Balancer and connected
networks
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
With an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, the supported traffic types are
either IPv4 or IPv6 .
For information about the supported protocols, see
Forwarding rule protocols .
Each internal passthrough Network Load Balancer has at least one regional internal
forwarding rule. The regional internal forwarding rules point to the load
balancer's regional internal backend service. The following diagram shows how a
forwarding rule fits into the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer architecture.
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer forwarding rule (click to enlarge).
The following diagram shows how the load balancer components
fit within a subnet and region.
The internal forwarding rule must be defined in a region and a subnet.
The backend service only needs to correspond to that region.

External forwarding rules
External forwarding rules accept traffic from client systems that have internet
access, including:
A client outside of Google Cloud
A Google Cloud VM with an external IP address
A Google Cloud VM without an external IP address using
Cloud NAT or an instance-based NAT system
Note: For an on-premises network connected through Cloud VPN or
Cloud Interconnect, use an internal forwarding
rule with an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer or internal Application Load Balancer.
External forwarding rules are used by the following Google Cloud load
balancer types:
External Application Load Balancer
External proxy Network Load Balancer
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer
External Application Load Balancer
For external Application Load Balancers, the forwarding rule and IP address depend on the
load balancer mode , and the
Network Service Tiers that you select for the load balancer.
In an external Application Load Balancer, a forwarding rule points to a target HTTP(S) proxy.
External forwarding rules connected to a target HTTP(S) proxy support any port
number between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
The global external Application Load Balancer supports only Premium Tier.
Each classic Application Load Balancer can be Premium Tier or Standard Tier.
The regional external Application Load Balancer supports both Premium and Standard Tier.
IP address and forwarding rule requirements change depending on the Network
Service Tier:
In Premium Tier, global external Application Load Balancers and classic Application Load Balancers use a
global external IP address, which can be either IPv4 or IPv6, and a global
external forwarding rule. You can provide a globally accessible application
that directs end users to backends in the closest region and distributes
traffic among multiple regions. Because a global external forwarding rule uses
a single external IP address, you don't need to maintain separate DNS records
in different regions or wait for DNS changes to propagate.
You can have two different global external IP addresses pointing to the same
global external Application Load Balancer. For example, in Premium Tier, the global external IP address
for one forwarding rule can be IPv4, and the global external IP address for a
second forwarding rule can be IPv6. Both forwarding rules can point to the
same target proxy. As a result, you can provide both an IPv4 and an IPv6
address for the same external Application Load Balancer. For more information, see the IPv6
termination documentation.
In Premium Tier, regional external Application Load Balancers use a regional external IPv4
address and a regional external forwarding rule.
In Standard Tier, regional external Application Load Balancers and
classic Application Load Balancers use a regional external IPv4
address and a regional external forwarding rule. A load balancer in Standard
Tier can only distribute traffic to backends within a single region.
The following diagram shows how a global forwarding rule fits into the
architecture for a global external Application Load Balancer. The same architecture also applies
to the classic Application Load Balancer in Premium Tier.
Global external Application Load Balancer forwarding rule (click to enlarge).
Note :
It is possible to attach EXTERNAL_MANAGED backend services to
EXTERNAL forwarding rules. However, EXTERNAL backend
services cannot be attached to EXTERNAL_MANAGED forwarding rules.
To take advantage of new features available
only with the global external Application Load Balancer , we
recommend that you migrate your existing EXTERNAL resources to
EXTERNAL_MANAGED by using the migration process described at
Migrate
resources from classic to global external Application Load Balancer .
For more information about external Application Load Balancers, see the
External Application Load Balancer overview .
External proxy Network Load Balancer
An external proxy Network Load Balancer offers TCP proxying capability, with optional SSL
offload. An external proxy Network Load Balancer is similar to an external Application Load Balancer because it can
terminate SSL (TLS) sessions. However, these load balancers don't support
path-based redirection like external Application Load Balancers, so they're better suited for
handling SSL for protocols other than HTTPS, such as IMAP or WebSockets over
SSL. In an external proxy Network Load Balancer, a forwarding rule points to either a TCP or an
SSL target proxy.
External proxy Network Load Balancers support both Premium Tier and Standard Tier. The
forwarding rule and IP address depend on the type of load balancer mode and the
Network Service Tiers that you select for the load balancer:
The classic proxy Network Load Balancer can be Premium Tier or Standard Tier.
The global external proxy Network Load Balancer supports only Premium Tier.
The regional external proxy Network Load Balancer supports both Premium and Standard Tier.
IP address and forwarding rule requirements change depending on the Network
Service Tier:
In Premium Tier, global external proxy Network Load Balancers and
classic proxy Network Load Balancers use a global external IP address, which can be
either IPv4 or IPv6, and a global external forwarding rule. You can provide a
globally accessible application that directs end users to backends in the
closest region and distributes traffic among multiple regions. Because a
global external forwarding rule uses a single external IP address, you don't
have to maintain separate DNS records in different regions or wait for DNS
changes to propagate.
It is possible to have two different global external IP addresses pointing to
the same external proxy Network Load Balancer. For example, in Premium Tier, the global
external IP address for one forwarding rule can be IPv4, and the global
external IP address for a second forwarding rule can be IPv6. Both forwarding
rules can point to the same target proxy. As a result, you can provide both an
IPv4 and an IPv6 address for the same external proxy Network Load Balancer. For more
information, see the IPv6 termination
documentation.
In Premium Tier, regional external proxy Network Load Balancers use a regional external
IPv4 address and a regional external forwarding rule.
In Standard Tier, regional external proxy Network Load Balancers and
classic proxy Network Load Balancers use a regional external IPv4 address and a
regional external forwarding rule. A load balancer in Standard
Tier can only distribute traffic to backends within a single region.
External forwarding rules connected to a target TCP or SSL proxy support
any port number between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
The following diagram shows how a forwarding rule fits into the
global external proxy Network Load Balancer architecture.

For more information about external proxy Network Load Balancers, see the
External proxy Network Load Balancer overview .
For information about configuring external proxy Network Load Balancers, see
Set up an external proxy Network Load Balancer .
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers is a pass-through load balancer that distributes
traffic among backend instances in a single region.
A regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer uses a regional external forwarding rule and a regional
external IP address. The regional external IP address can be
accessed from anywhere on the internet and by Google Cloud VMs with
internet access.
For backend service-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers, the regional external forwarding
rule points to a backend
service .
Backend service-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers support
TCP, UDP, ESP, GRE, ICMP, and ICMPv6
traffic. For details, see Forwarding rule protocols
for backend service-based
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers .
Forwarding rules for backend service-based load balancers can be
configured with either IPv4 or IPv6
addresses .
Forwarding rules for backend service-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers support the
following advanced features:
Direct traffic coming from a specific range of source IP addresses
to a specific backend service. For more information,
see Traffic steering .
Distribute traffic across the load balancer's backend instances based on the
weights reported by an HTTP health check using
Weighted load balancing .
For target pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers, the forwarding rule points to a
target pool . A target
pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer supports only TCP or UDP traffic. Forwarding rules
for target pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer support only IPv4 addresses.
For regional external IPv4 addresses, the regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer supports
both Standard Tier and Premium Tier. Regional external IPv6 addresses are only
available in the Premium Tier.
To support backend instances in more than one region, you must create a
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer in each region. This is the case regardless of
whether the IP address of the load balancer is in the Premium Tier or the
Standard Tier.
The following figure shows a regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer which has a regional external
forwarding rule with the IP address, 120.1.1.1 . The load balancer is serving
requests from backends in the us-central1 region.
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer example (click to enlarge).
For more information about regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers, see the
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer overview .
For information about configuring regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers, see one of the following:
Setting up a regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer with a backend
service (TCP or UDP traffic only)
Setting up a regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer with a backend
service (multiple protocols)
Setting up a regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer with a target
pool
How Network Service Tiers affect load balancers
In Network Service Tiers , the distinction between
Standard Tier and Premium Tier depends on how far traffic is routed over the
public internet:
Standard Tier : Offloads traffic as close as possible to the data center.
This means that traffic is typically routed over the public internet for a
longer distance, compared with Premium Tier.
Premium Tier : Routes traffic through Google's production network as far as
possible before leaving Google Cloud to get to the end user.
Load balancer
Supported Network Service Tiers
Global external Application Load Balancer
Global external proxy Network Load Balancer
These load balancers are always Premium Tier. Their backend
services, forwarding rules, and IP addresses are global.
Classic Application Load Balancer
Classic proxy Network Load Balancer
These load balancers can be Premium Tier or Standard Tier.
With Premium Tier, they are global. Their forwarding rules,
IP addresses, and backend services are global.
In Standard Tier, these load balancers are effectively regional. Their
backend services are global , but their forwarding rules and IP
addresses are regional.
Regional external Application Load Balancer
Regional external proxy Network Load Balancer
These load balancers can be Premium or Standard Tier. Their backend
services, forwarding rules, and IP addresses are always regional.
Cross-region internal Application Load Balancer
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer
Cross-region internal proxy Network Load Balancer
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
These load balancers support traffic within a VPC network
(including networks connected to it). Traffic is Premium Tier because it is
within a VPC network.
Regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer
These load balancers must use regional external IPv4 or IPv6
addresses.
These load balancers can be either Premium or Standard Tier. IPv6
addresses require Premium Tier.
Only the
backend
service-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers can handle IPv6 traffic.
IP protocol specifications
Each forwarding rule has an associated IP protocol that the rule will serve.
The default protocol value is TCP .
Note: For regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers, the L3_DEFAULT
forwarding rule protocol can be used to load balance
TCP, UDP, ESP, GRE, ICMP, and ICMPv6
traffic.
For internal passthrough Network Load Balancer forwarding rules that use IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, the
L3_DEFAULT forwarding rule protocol can be used to load balance
the
TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMPv6, SCTP, ESP, AH, and GRE
traffic.

IP address specifications
The forwarding rule must have an IP address that your customers use to reach
your load balancer. The IP address can be static or ephemeral.
A static IP address provides a single reserved IP address that you can
point your domain to. If you ever need to delete your forwarding rule and re-add
it, you can continue using the same reserved IP address.
An ephemeral IP address remains constant while the forwarding rule exists.
When you choose an ephemeral IP address, Google Cloud associates an IP
address with your load balancer's forwarding rule. If you need to delete the
forwarding rule and re-add it, the forwarding rule might receive a new IP
address.
Depending on the load balancer type, the IP address can have various
attributes. The following table summarizes the valid IP address configurations,
based on the load balancing scheme and the target of the forwarding rule.

It is possible to attach EXTERNAL_MANAGED backend services to
EXTERNAL forwarding rules. However, EXTERNAL backend
services cannot be attached to EXTERNAL_MANAGED forwarding rules.

recommend that you migrate your existing EXTERNAL resources to
EXTERNAL_MANAGED by using the migration process described at
Migrate
resources from classic to global external Application Load Balancer .
Multiple forwarding rules with a common IP address
Two or more forwarding rules with the EXTERNAL or EXTERNAL_MANAGED load
balancing scheme (or a combination of both) can share the same IP address if the
following are true:
The ports used by each forwarding rule don't overlap. This is because
each combination of IP address + protocol + port must be unique.
The Network Service Tiers of each forwarding rule matches the
Network Service Tiers of the external IP address.
Examples:
A regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer that accepts traffic on TCP port 79 and another
regional external passthrough Network Load Balancer that accepts traffic on TCP port 80 can share the same
regional external IP address.
You can use the same global external IP address for an external Application Load Balancer
(HTTP and HTTPS).
Two or more forwarding rules with the INTERNAL or INTERNAL_MANAGED load
balancing scheme (or a combination of both) can share the same IP address if the
following is true:
The ports used by each forwarding rule don't overlap. This is because
each combination of IP address + protocol + port must be unique.
For more information, see the following:
For internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, see Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer forwarding rules that use a
common IP address
For internal Application Load Balancers, see Use a common IP address between multiple internal
forwarding rules
For internal proxy Network Load Balancers, see Forwarding rules and IP
addresses
If the forwarding rule's load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED for
Cloud Service Mesh, it must have a unique IP address.

Backend service
If the forwarding rule protocol is TCP or UDP ,
you can configure:
A list of up to five (contiguous or non-contiguous) ports, or,
A single port range (contiguous), or,
All ports. To configure all ports, either
set --ports=ALL using the gcloud command line
tool, or set allPorts to True using the API.
If the forwarding rule protocol is L3_DEFAULT ,
you must configure all ports.
To configure all ports, either
set --ports=ALL using the gcloud command line
tool, or set allPorts to True using the API.
Target pool
Must be a single port range (contiguous)
Specifying a port is optional for forwarding rules used with target
pool-based regional external passthrough Network Load Balancers. If no port is specified, traffic from
all ports (1-65535) is forwarded.

IAM conditions
With Identity and Access Management (IAM) conditions, you can set conditions
to control which roles are granted to principals. This feature lets you grant
permissions to principals if configured conditions are met.
An IAM condition checks the load balancing scheme (for example,
INTERNAL or EXTERNAL ) in the forwarding rule and allows (or disallows)
creation of the forwarding rule. If a principal tries to create a forwarding
rule without permission, an error message appears.
For more information, see IAM
Conditions .
Use forwarding rules
If you're using the Google Cloud console to set up a load balancer, the
forwarding rule is set up implicitly as part of your frontend configuration. If
you're using the Google Cloud CLI or the API, you need to configure the
forwarding rule explicitly.
After creating a forwarding rule, you can make limited changes to it. For
example, after a forwarding rule is defined, you can't change its IP address,
port number, or protocol. However, you can update certain settings for
forwarding rules by editing the frontend configuration of the load balancer they
are associated with. Use either the gcloud CLI or the API to make any other
changes.
Change the IP address of a forwarding rule
You cannot change the IP address of an existing forwarding rule.
To update the IP address of a forwarding rule, you must delete
and recreate the rule as follows:
Delete the forwarding rule using the
gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete command
or the forwardingRules.delete method .
Recreate the forwarding rule using the
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create command
or the forwardingRules.insert method .
APIs
