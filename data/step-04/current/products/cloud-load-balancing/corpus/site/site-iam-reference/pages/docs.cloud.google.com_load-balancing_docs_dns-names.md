Internal load balancing and DNS names
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A DNS address record, known as an A record , is used to map a DNS name to an
IP address. When you create the forwarding rule for an internal load balancer,
you can optionally designate a service label so that Google Cloud
creates a unique Compute Engine internal DNS
name for the load balancer. This internal DNS name
is constructed from your project ID, forwarding rule name, and a service label
you specify.
Note: This page describes how to configure a specific load balancer component or
feature before or after you've already created a load balancer. Working with
specific components is useful for advanced configurations and necessary for some
configuration options. Before using the information on this page, know the type
of Google Cloud load balancer
that you need.
Specifications
This feature is supported by forwarding rules for these load balancers:
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer
See DNS record format for details about the format of
the DNS name that Google Cloud creates for your load balancer. Because
the DNS name contains the forwarding rule's name, each DNS name is unique,
even if you use the same service label for multiple forwarding rules.
Unless an alternative name server is
configured , client VMs in any
region in the same project and VPC network can perform DNS
lookups for the load balancer's internal DNS name. To access the load
balancer, client VMs must be located in the same
region .
If you enable
global access, a client in any region can access the load balancer.
You can only specify a service label when you create a forwarding rule. You
cannot add a service label to an existing forwarding rule. However, you can
replace an existing forwarding rule with a new forwarding rule that has a
service label. The replacement can use the same internal
IP address as the original if you delete the original forwarding rule first.
The internal DNS names created from service labels have the following
restrictions:
No corresponding reverse (PTR) records are created.
Each forwarding rule can have only one service label.
Other than the service label and forwarding rule's name, you cannot change
any other part of the internal DNS name. This includes its format and its
domain name ( .internal ).
If you need more flexible DNS names for your internal load balancer, you
can create custom records in a Cloud DNS managed private
zone .
DNS record format
When you add a service label to a forwarding rule, Google Cloud creates
a Compute Engine internal DNS A record using one of these formats:
For internal passthrough Network Load Balancers:
SERVICE_LABEL . FORWARDING_RULE_NAME .il4. REGION .lb. PROJECT_ID .internal
For regional internal Application Load Balancers and regional internal proxy Network Load Balancers:
SERVICE_LABEL . FORWARDING_RULE_NAME .il7. REGION .lb. PROJECT_ID .internal
SERVICE_LABEL is the forwarding rule's service label that you
specify. It must follow this format:
You can use up to 63 lower case letters ( a to z ), numbers ( 0 to
9 ), or dashes ( - ).
The service label must start with a lowercase letter.
The service label must end with a lowercase letter or number.
FORWARDING_RULE_NAME is the name of the forwarding rule you're
creating.
REGION is the load balancer's region.
PROJECT_ID is your project
ID .
Project IDs that have the form organization:project-id are converted to
project-id.organization . For example, if your project ID is
example.com:example-marketing-prod , Google Cloud uses
example-marketing-prod.example.com .
Creating a forwarding rule with a service label
This procedure shows how to create a forwarding rule with a service label.
This procedure only focuses on how to create a forwarding rule with a service
label. Properties of the load balancer's backend configuration and other
properties of its frontend configuration are omitted. If you're new to
internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, regional internal Application Load Balancers, or regional internal proxy Network Load Balancers,
see these pages for complete examples:
Set up an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
Set up a regional internal Application Load Balancer
Set up a regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer
Console
Note: For regional internal proxy Network Load Balancers, creating a forwarding rule with a
service label is not supported in the Google Cloud console. Use
gcloud or the API instead.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load balancing page.
Go to Load balancing
Click Create load balancer .
Complete the steps of the wizard to create either an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
or a regional internal Application Load Balancer, and click Configure .
Specify a name for the load balancer.
Click Continue .
Complete the Backend configuration .
Click Frontend configuration . Complete the frontend configuration,
specifying a Service label at the bottom of that section.
Click Done , and then Review and finalize .

Viewing service labels
Console
You can view the Compute Engine internal DNS name (created from the
service label) for each internal forwarding rule of an internal load
balancer:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load balancing page.
Go to Load balancing
Click the name of the internal load balancer to view its details
page.
The internal forwarding rules assigned to the load balancer are listed in
the Frontend section. The DNS name column shows you the
Compute Engine internal DNS name that's assigned to each
forwarding rule. The service label is the first part of that name
(before the first dot). If no name is shown, the forwarding rule has no
service label defined.
gcloud
List forwarding rules in your project used by either internal passthrough Network Load Balancers or
regional internal Application Load Balancers. Locate the one you need, and note its name and
region for the next step.
gcloud compute forwarding-rules list \
--filter="loadBalancingScheme= SCHEME "
The value of SCHEME depends on the forwarding rules you need
to list:
For internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, use INTERNAL .
For regional internal Application Load Balancers and regional internal proxy Network Load Balancers, use
INTERNAL_MANAGED .
Describe the forwarding rule, replacing FORWARDING_RULE_NAME
with its name and REGION with its region:
gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe FORWARDING_RULE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--format="get(serviceLabel)"
api
View the forwarding rule and service label with the
forwardingRules.get
method
The response to the API request includes the service label ( serviceLabel )
and Compute Engine internal DNS name ( serviceName ).
GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT /regions/ REGION /forwardingRules/ FORWARDING_RULE_NAME
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer response:
{
...
"serviceLabel": " SERVICE_LABEL ",
"serviceName": " SERVICE_LABEL . FORWARDING_RULE_NAME .il4. REGION .lb. PROJECT .internal",
...
}
Regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer and regional internal Application Load Balancer response:
{
...
"serviceLabel": " SERVICE_LABEL ",
"serviceName": " SERVICE_LABEL . FORWARDING_RULE_NAME .il7. REGION .lb. PROJECT .internal",
...
}
Example
The following procedure demonstrates how to replace a forwarding rule with one
that has a service label. This procedure works for all supported load balancers.
If you haven't created a forwarding rule for your internal load balancer yet,
skip this example and refer to Creating a forwarding rule with a service
label instead.
Describe your load balancer's existing forwarding rule, noting the forwarding
rule's internal IP address:
gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe FORWARDING_RULE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--format="get(IPAddress)"
Delete the forwarding rule:
gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete FORWARDING_RULE_NAME \
--region= REGION
Create a replacement forwarding rule with the same name and internal IP
address with a service label. Refer to Creating a forwarding rule with a
service label for directions.
