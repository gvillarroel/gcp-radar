Health check logging information
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can get logs of load balancing
health checks when an endpoint
changes in health status. You can use health check logs for the following:
Live debugging and troubleshooting your endpoint health status
Getting visibility into your endpoint's health status
Auditing and compliance purposes
Health checks log health transition information to
Logging .
You enable or disable logging on a per-health check basis.
To see health check logs in Logging, you must ensure that you
don't have a logs exclusion that applies to health checks. For instructions
about how to verify that GCE Instance Group and
Network Endpoint Group logs are allowed, see
Exclusion filters .
Enable and disable logging
This section describes how to enable logging on a new or an existing
health check, and how to disable logging on an existing health check.
Enable logging on a new health check
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Health checks page.
Go to Health checks
Click Create health check .
For Logs , select On .
Continue setting up your health check.
gcloud
gcloud compute health-checks create PROTOCOL HEALTH_CHECK_NAME \
--enable-logging
The flag --enable-logging enables logging for that health check.
Terraform
To create a health check for different protocols with logging, use the
google_compute_health_check resource .
resource "google_compute_health_check" "health_check_tcp_with_logging" {
provider = google-beta
name = "health-check-tcp"
timeout_sec = 1
check_interval_sec = 1
tcp_health_check {
port = "22"
}
log_config {
enable = true
}
}
For a regional load balancer, use the google_compute_region_health_check resource .
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see
Basic Terraform commands .
Enable logging on an existing health check
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Health checks page.
Go to Health checks
Click the name of your health check.
Click edit Edit .
For Logs , select On .
Click Save .
gcloud
gcloud compute health-checks update PROTOCOL HEALTH_CHECK_NAME \
--enable-logging
The flag --enable-logging enables logging for that health check.
Disable logging on an existing health check
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Health checks page.
Go to Health checks
Click the name of your health check.
Click edit Edit .
For Logs , select Off .
Click Save .
gcloud
gcloud compute health-checks update PROTOCOL HEALTH_CHECK_NAME \
--no-enable-logging
The flag --no-enable-logging disables logging for that health check.
View logs
To view logs, go to the Logs explorer .
Health check logs are indexed by instance group
or network endpoint group .
To see all logs, in the Resource menu, select either
GCE Instance Group or Network Endpoint Group ,
depending on the type of backend.
Alternatively, paste the following into the Query field. Replace
PROJECT_ID with your project's ID.
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fhealthchecks"
You can configure export of
logs-based metrics for load balancer
health checks.
Use filters to view logs
You can also get logs based on more specific searches. For example, the
following filter shows all logs for a specified backend instance IP address:
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fhealthchecks"
jsonPayload.healthCheckProbeResult.ipAddress=" IP_ADDRESS "
Log fields of type boolean typically only appear if they have a value of true .
If a boolean field has a value of false , that field is omitted from the log.
UTF-8 encoding
is enforced for log fields. Characters that are not UTF-8
characters are replaced with question marks.
What is logged
Health check log entries contain information useful for monitoring
and debugging the state of your endpoints. Log entries contain the following
types of information:
General information shown in most logs, such as severity, project ID,
project number, and timestamp.
Fields specific to health checks, described in the following tables.
Health check states
An endpoint is considered either HEALTHY or UNHEALTHY . These are the basic
states. Within each of these basic states, there are several more detailed
states.
Hybrid NEGs and regional internet NEGs using distributed Envoy
health checks do not support detailed health states.
The following table shows the mapping between basic and detailed health states.
Basic health state
Detailed health state
HEALTHY
HEALTHY
DRAINING
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
UNHEALTHY
TIMEOUT
State changes don't always alter the behavior of the load balancer. Consider the
following case:
The server is giving the wrong response, so the endpoint is considered
UNHEALTHY .
The server then stops responding, and the new state is TIMEOUT .
The load balancer still considers the endpoint to be UNHEALTHY
because the detailed TIMEOUT state maps to the basic
UNHEALTHY state.
The following table provides a definition of each health state.
Detailed health check state
Meaning
Basic state
HEALTHY
The endpoint is reachable and conforms to the requirements
defined by the health check.
HEALTHY
UNHEALTHY
The endpoint is reachable but does not conform to the requirements
defined by the health check.
UNHEALTHY
DRAINING
The endpoint is being drained. The existing connections to the endpoint
are allowed to complete, but the new ones are being refused. Endpoint
is considered HEALTHY .
HEALTHY
TIMEOUT
The endpoint is unreachable. Depending on the health check type, either
a connection to the endpoint cannot be established or the server did not
respond within the specified timeout. Endpoint is considered
UNHEALTHY .
UNHEALTHY
UNKNOWN
The health check system is aware of the endpoint, but its health is not
known. Endpoint is considered UNHEALTHY .
UNHEALTHY
There are multiple health checkers probing each endpoint; Google Cloud
de-duplicates the log entries before logging so that only unique logs are
generated.
If a health checker restarts, you might occasionally see the logged health state
change from UNKNOWN to one of the known states listed earlier even though the
endpoint's health state has not actually changed. Google Cloud uses
best-effort heuristics to suppress such log entries.
If you are using
connection draining , then
health check logs are not be generated with the endpoint health status
DRAINING . This is because health check logs reflect the results observed by
the health check probes, and connection draining does not impact the results
observed by the health check probe. Connection draining works by just informing
the load balancer that the new state is DRAINING , and it effectively overrides
the true health state of the endpoint as observed by the health checker.
You can interact with the logs by using the Cloud Logging API. The API
provides ways to interactively filter logs that have specific fields set and
export matching logs to Cloud Logging, Cloud Storage, BigQuery,
or Pub/Sub. For more information about the Cloud Logging API,
see Cloud Logging API overview .
Health check log entry
The
LogEntry
jsonPayload is populated with a field healthCheckProbeResult that contains
the following information.
Field

targetPort
int
The port that was the target of the probe. This can be the default
port of the probe or the port that you specified when you created
the health check.

Limitations
Logs are generated for endpoint health transition only.
Legacy health checks
are not supported.
Target pools are not supported.
Logs are not generated when the endpoint's health state is UNKNOWN .
In case of VM migrations, you might not see any log entries generated when
the endpoint's health transitions to the UNHEALTHY state.
Logs are not generated when endpoints are deleted. For example, when you
stop a VM.
