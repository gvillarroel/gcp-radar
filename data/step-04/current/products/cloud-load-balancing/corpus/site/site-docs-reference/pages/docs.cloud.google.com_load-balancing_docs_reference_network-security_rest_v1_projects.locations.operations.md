JSON representation
Methods
Resource: Operation
This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
JSON representation
{
"name" : string ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
} ,
"done" : boolean ,
// Union field result can be only one of the following:
"error" : {
object ( Status )
} ,
"response" : {
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
}
// End of list of possible types for union field result .
}
Fields
name
string
The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should be a resource name ending with operations/{unique_id} .
metadata
object
Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
done
boolean
If the value is false , it means the operation is still in progress. If true , the operation is completed, and either error or response is available.
Union field result . The operation result, which can be either an error or a valid response . If done == false , neither error nor response is set. If done == true , exactly one of error or response can be set. Some services might not provide the result. result can be only one of the following:
error
object ( Status )
The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
response
object
The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete , the response is google.protobuf.Empty . If the original method is standard Get / Create / Update , the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse , where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot() , the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse .
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
Methods
cancel
Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.
delete
Deletes a long-running operation.
get
Gets the latest state of a long-running operation.
list
Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request.
