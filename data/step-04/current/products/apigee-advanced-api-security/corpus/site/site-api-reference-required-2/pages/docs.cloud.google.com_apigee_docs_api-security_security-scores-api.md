Overview
This page describes how to manage Risk Assessment security scores and security profiles
(also referred to simply as "profiles") using APIs. This page presents example API requests.
Note : The APIs for Risk Assessment v1 and v2 have separate data and
APIs. The APIs from one cannot be used to query the other. For example, Risk Assessment v1
APIs cannot be used to query Risk Assessment v2 data.
For an overview of the Risk Assessment functionality, including limitations, and instructions for
using the UI, see
Risk assessment overview and UI .
Risk Assessment v2 API Examples
Preview
— Risk Assessment v2
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Parameters for v2 API examples
The examples in this section can use these parameters:
ORG is your organization.
ENV is the environment in which you want scores to be calculated.
PROFILE_ID is the name of the profile. PROFILE_ID can be
google-default or the name of a custom profile that you create.
PROFILE_DESC (optional) is the description for the profile. This should be a
human-readable description of the profile that provides enough information to differentiate it
from other profiles.
PROXY_NAME : The name of the proxy.
RESOURCES can be:
"include_all_resources":{} to monitor all resources within the scope.
"include": { "resources": [{"type": "API_PROXY", "name": " PROXY_NAME "}]} to monitor one
or more specified proxies. For example,
"include": { "resources": [{"type": "API_PROXY", "name": "my-proxy-1"}]} to
monitor the proxy called my-proxy-1 .
SECURITY_MONITORING_CONDITION_ID : The unique ID of the security
monitoring condition. If no ID is provided, a UUID is generated automatically.
$TOKEN is the environment variable for an
OAuth access token .
Retrieve batch security assessment results
Users with the Security Admin or Security Viewer roles have permissions
to perform an ad hoc risk assessment computation. You'll need to specify the security profile,
scope (the Apigee environment), and resources to be assessed. Resources
could be include_all_resources: true to
compute on all resources within the scope, or only a handful. See
securityAssessmentResults.batchCompute
in the Apigee Management API reference documentation for more information on this functionality.
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityAssessmentResults:batchCompute" \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
"profile": " PROFILE_ID ",
"scope": " ENV ",
RESOURCES
}'
This is a potential response for the request:
{
"securityAssessmentResults": [
{
"resource": {
"type": "API_PROXY",
"name": "my-proxy-1",
"resourceRevisionId": "1"
},
"createTime": "2023-11-22T04:49:29.418166Z",

Manage security profiles
This section provides examples for managing security profiles using the APIs and is not
exhaustive. See the
securityProfilesV2 API reference docs
for more information.
Get existing custom security profiles
This command retrieves the information for all security profiles for your project:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfilesV2" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
This command retrieves the metadata for a specific security profile and can be used to
retrieve information on the google-default profile as well as custom profiles:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfilesV2/ PROFILE_ID " \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Create a new custom security profile
To create a new custom security profile, use a command like this:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfilesV2?security_profile_v2_id= PROFILE_ID " \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
"description": " PROFILE_DESC ",
"risk_assessment_type": "APIGEE",
"profile_assessment_configs": {
"auth-policies-check": {"weight": "MINOR"},
"threat-policies-check": {"weight": "MODERATE"}
}
}'
Update an existing custom security profile
To update an existing profile, use a command like:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfilesV2/ PROFILE_ID ?update_mask= UPDATE_MASK " \
-X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-d '{"description": " PROFILE_DESC "}'
where UPDATE_MASK can be one of these values, if present: description ,
profile_assessment_configs , description,profile_assessment_configs , or
* (everything). If specifying the
* update mask, the request updates all fields, which could remove values if they
are not included in the request.
Omitting update_mask updates only the fields provided in the update request.
Delete a custom security profile
The delete a custom security profile:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfilesV2/ PROFILE_ID " \
-X DELETE \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Manage monitoring conditions
This section provides examples for managing monitoring conditions using the APIs and is not
exhaustive. See the
monitoring conditions API reference docs
for more information on managing monitoring conditions through the APIs.
Create a new monitoring condition
To create a new monitoring condition, use a command like this:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityMonitoringConditions?security_monitoring_condition_id= MONITORING_CONDITION_ID " \
-X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
"profile": " PROFILE_ID ",
"scope": " ENV ",
RESOURCES
}'
The response could look like:
{
"name": "organizations/my-org/securityMonitoringConditions/my-condition",
"createTime": "2025-11-22T05:02:16.089469Z",
"updateTime": "2023-11-22T05:02:16.089469Z",
"profile": "google-default",
"scope": "test",
"totalMonitoredResources": 4,
"totalDeployedResources": 4,
"includeAllResources": {}
}
List monitoring conditions
To get a list of monitoring conditions in your organization, use a command like this:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
"https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityMonitoringConditions"
The response is in this form:
{
"securityMonitoringConditions": [
{
"name": "organizations/my-org/securityMonitoringConditions/my-condition",

"profile": "google-default",
"scope": "test",
"totalMonitoredResources": 4,
"totalDeployedResources": 4,
"includeAllResources": {}
}
]
}
You could also use this syntax to limit the returned results by scope or security profile:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
"https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityMonitoringConditions?filter=scope= ENV %20AND%20profile= PROFILE_ID "
Get an existing monitoring condition
To get the information for an existing monitoring condition, use a command like this:

Use the default security profile
The following examples show how to use the
default security profile .
See Parameters in example API calls for the
parameters used in the examples.
Attach the default security profile to an environment
To view security scores, you need to attach a profile to the environment whose security
you want to evaluate. To attach the default
security
profile to an environment, use the following command:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfiles/default/environments" \
-X POST \
-d '{"name": " ENV "}' \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Note: The parameter securityProfileRevisionId has been
deprecated. If you include this parameter in an API call, Advanced API Security will use the
latest revision of the profile, regardless of the value of the parameter.
Get the default security profile definition
To get the definition of the default security profile, enter the following command:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfiles/default" \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Detach the default security profile from an environment
If you need to detach the default profile from an environment, you can do so as follows:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfiles/default/environments/ ENV " \
-X DELETE
-H 'Content-type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Use a custom security profile
Preview — Advanced API Security Custom Profiles
This feature is covered by the Pre-GA Offerings Terms
of the Google Cloud Terms of Service. Pre-GA features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA features
may not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Support for the Preview launch of Advanced API Security Custom Profiles is available through
the
Apigee - Google Cloud Community forum.
You can create a
custom security profile with an API call in either of the following ways:
Explicitly define the profile in the body of the call.
Attach a JSON file that contains the profile definition to the call.
The following sections give examples of both methods.
See Parameters in example API calls for the
parameters used in the examples.
The following fields in the example API calls specify the custom profile:
description : A description of the custom profile.
profileConfig : A list of the categories to include in the custom profile. This
can be any subset of the following
security categories :
abuse
authorization
cors
mtls
mediation
threat
Define the profile in the body of an API call
To define a custom profile in the body of an API call, enter a command similar to the following:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfiles?security_profile_id= PROFILE_ID " \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"description":"test custom profile",
"profileConfig" : {
"categories":[
{"cors":{}},
{"threat":{}}
]
}
}'
This creates a custom profile that includes the categories cors and threat, and
returns a response like this:
{
"name": " PROFILE_ID ",
"revisionId": "1",
"revisionCreateTime": "2023-07-17T18:47:08Z",
"revisionUpdateTime": "2023-07-17T18:47:08Z",
"scoringConfigs": [
{
"title": "json",
"scorePath": "/org@ ORG /envgroup@ ENVGROUP /env@ ENV /proxies/proxy@$proxy/policies/individual/security/threat/json",
"description": "Check if JSONThreatProtection policy is configured."
},
{
"title": "xml",
"scorePath": "/org@ ORG /envgroup@ ENVGROUP /env@ ENV /proxies/proxy@$proxy/policies/individual/security/threat/xml",
"description": "Check if XMLThreatProtection policy is configured."
},
{
"title": "cors",
"scorePath": "/org@ ORG /envgroup@ ENVGROUP /env@ ENV /proxies/proxy@$proxy/policies/individual/security/cors",
"description": "Check if CORS policy is configured."
}
],
"maxScore": 1200,
"minScore": 200,
"profileConfig": {
"categories": [
{
"cors": {}
},
{
"threat": {}
}
]
},
"description": "test custom profile"
}
Define the profile by attaching a JSON file to an API call
You can also define a custom security profile by attaching a JSON file that defines
the profile to an API call. As an example, first create the following JSON file:
{
"description": "test custom profile",
"profileConfig" : {
"categories":[
{"cors":{}},
{"threat" :{}},
]
}
}
This defines a profile with categories cors and threat. You can then create a profile based
on these categories as follows:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfiles?security_profile_id= PROFILE_ID " \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @create_profile.json
where create_profile.json is the name of the JSON file described above.
Get a custom security profile definition
To get the definition of a custom security profile, enter a command similar to the following:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfiles/ PROFILE_ID " \
-X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
Detach a custom security profile from an environment
To detach a custom security profile from an environment, enter a command
similar to the following:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfiles/ PROFILE_ID /environments/ ENV " \
-X DELETE \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
Delete a custom security profile
To delete a custom security profile, enter a command similar to the
following:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /securityProfiles/ PROFILE_ID " \
-X DELETE \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
Note: If you delete a custom security profile, you will lose all
scores related to the profile, and all environments attached to the profile will be
automatically detached.
Get scores for an environment
The following sections present examples of getting scores for an environment.
See Parameters in example API calls for the
parameters used in the examples.
