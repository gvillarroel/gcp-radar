Enrich API data with custom curation in API hub
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial shows you how to enrich API data in Apigee API hub with API specifications, like OpenAPI specs, that are stored outside of API hub. You'll use API hub's custom curation features to automatically fetch API specifications from a Cloud Storage bucket and associate them with their corresponding Apigee API proxies. The logic for this custom curation is defined using an integration in Application Integration.
Throughout the tutorial, you'll set up the required Google Cloud services, configure a custom curation integration, create a new plugin instance in API hub, and verify the enriched API data.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you will complete the following steps:
Step 1: Create an integration for custom curation
Step 2: Set up custom curation in API hub
Step 3: Edit existing plugin instance
Step 4: Verify enriched API data
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Application Integration
Integration Connectors
Cloud Storage
Secret Manager
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
Before you begin this tutorial, ensure you have completed the following:
Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use to create the connection:
roles/secretmanager.viewer,
roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
roles/storage.admin
For information on granting roles, see Granting, changing, and revoking access .
If you do not have an existing Apigee setup, provision an Apigee eval org .
Provision API hub in your Google Cloud project .
Provision Application Integration in your Google Cloud project .
Provision Integration Connectors in your Google Cloud project .
Note: Both Application Integration and Integration Connectors must be provisioned within the same location as API hub in your project. This tutorial assumes that the selected location is us-central1 (Iowa) .
Prepare the environment
Now, lets prepare the environment for our custom curation. This involves creating the necessary API proxies in Apigee and setting up Cloud Storage with your API specification files.
Create API proxies in Apigee
To get started, you'll first need to register the following sample API proxies in your Apigee project:
API proxy name
Configuration details
Base config
Revision config
Orders API
Proxy template: Reverse proxy
Target: https://mocktarget.apigee.net
Change target endpoint to: https://mocktarget.apigee.net/xml
Products API
Users API
Note: Ensure that each proxy has at least one revision deployed to an environment, and the environment must be part of an environment group.
For more information about how to register a proxy in Apigee, see Create an API proxy .
Set up Cloud Storage
Next, you'll set up Cloud Storage by creating a bucket and uploading the sample API specification files that will be used in the custom curation process.
Create Cloud Storage bucket
To create a Cloud Storage bucket that will hold your API specifications, do the following:
Note: For the purpose of this tutorial, you are only required to set the Global unique name field for your bucket; all other steps are either optional or can have the default settings.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage Buckets page.
Go to Buckets
Click add_box Create .
On the Create a bucket page, enter curation_bucket as the bucket name.
Click Create .
A confirmation dialog appears to set the access level of the bucket.
Click Confirm .
A new Cloud Storage bucket named curation_bucket is created and is listed in the Buckets page.
Upload API specification files
With your Cloud Storage bucket ready, you can now upload the sample API specification files.
Download the following specification files and use them for the purpose of this tutorial:
Spec file
Description
Download link
orders-api.yaml
This specification defines an API for managing customer orders.
Click to download
products-api.yaml
This specification describes an API for managing products.
Click to download
users-api.yaml
This specification outlines an API for managing user accounts.
Click to download
To upload the API specification files into your Cloud Storage bucket, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage Buckets page.
Go to Buckets
Click the curation_bucket bucket that you created to open the Bucket details page.
In the Objects tab, click Upload > Upload files .
In the file dialog, go to the API specification files that you downloaded and select them.
After the upload completes, you should see them listed in your bucket folder browser.
Configure Cloud Storage connection
To allow your curation integration to access the files in your bucket, you will now configure a Cloud Storage connection in Integration Connectors.
To configure a Cloud Storage connection, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Integration Connectors page.
Go to Integration Connectors
Click Connections from the left navigation menu to open the Connections page.
Click add_box Create New and provide the following details in the Create Connection page:
Location: select a desired location and click Next .
Connector: select Cloud Storage from the drop-down list and click Next .
Connector version: enter the version of your connector.
Connection name: enter fetch-specs .
Service Account: select the service account that you had created earlier.
Project ID: enter the ID of your Google Cloud project. For information about how to find your project ID, see Find the project name, number, and ID .
Note: Integration Connectors automatically checks if your default service account associated with the selected project ID has the required IAM roles. If the verification fails, click GRANT to manually grant this access.
1. Click Next .
Review your connection details and click Create .
A new connection is created and is listed in the Connections page.
Step 1: Create an integration for custom curation
With the environment ready, you can now define the custom curation logic using Application Integration, which will handle the process of identifying, enriching, and transforming the API metadata.
Download the following prebuilt integration JSON file and use it for the purpose of this tutorial:
Integration file
Download link
enrich-with-spec-yaml.json
Click to download
Create and upload an integration
To begin, you'll create a new integration in Application Integration and then upload the downloaded JSON file to define the curation logic:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Application Integration page.
Go to Application Integration
Click Integrations from the left navigation menu to open the Integrations page.
Click add_box Create integration and provide the following details in the Create Integration page:
Integration name: enter test-curation .
Description: enter Demo integration created for custom curation tutorial .
Region: select a desired location .
Click Create .
The new integration opens in the integration editor.
In the designer toolbar, click more_vert (Actions menu) and select Upload .
In the file browser dialog, select the downloaded JSON file, and then click Open .
A new version of the integration is created as shown in the following image:
Configure connector task in the integration
After uploading the integration, the next step is to configure the Connectors task to connect to your Cloud Storage bucket:
Click the Connectors task named Fetch spec from GCS to view the connector configuration pane.
Click Configure Connector .
Configure the following details in the Connectors Task Editor page:
Region: select a desired location .
Connection: Select fetch-specs .
Type: Select Actions .
Set entities/actions: Select DownloadObject as the action.
Click Done .
View integration components
The integration you uploaded contains several pre-configured components. The following table provides details about each element to help you understand how the curation logic works:
Component
Configuration
Description
API trigger
API Trigger ID: api_trigger/test-custom-curation_API_1
Receives data from the API hub plugin instance to invoke the integration for custom curation.
For Each Loop Task (For Each API)
List to iterate: apiData.apiMetadataList.apiMetadata
Sub-integration details:
Integration name: enrich-with-spec-yaml
Trigger ID: private_trigger/test-curate-1_Private_1
Iterates over the apiMetadata list and calls the sub-integration for each API resource. It also collates the response of each run in curatedAPIMetadataList , where each element of the array has the response from one particular run.
/application-integration/docs/configure-private-trigger">Private Trigger
(Enrich each API with spec)
Trigger ID: private_trigger/test-curate-1_Private_1
Invokes the sub-integration for each element in apiMetaData .
Data mapping task
(Construct GCS request payload)
Input:
connectorInputPayload (Fetch spec from GCS)
.SET_PROPERTY(
apiMetadata
.GET_PROPERTY("api")
.GET_PROPERTY("displayName")
.TO_STRING()
.CONCAT(".yaml")
.TO_LOWERCASE()
,
"ObjectFilePath"
)
Output: ConnectorInputPayload (Fetch spec from GCS)
Constructs the input payload for ConnectorInputPayload .
Connectors task
(Fetch spec from GCS)
Task input: connectorInputPayload (Fetch spec from GCS)
Task output: connectorOutputPayload (Fetch spec from GCS)
Connects to a Cloud Storage bucket created and performs file transfer operations.
Edge condition
(Fetched spec successfully)
Condition: $`ErrorInfo`.code$ = 0
Checks for successful connection execution and payload retrieval. If yes, proceeds to parse the spec contents.
Edge condition
(Failed to fetch spec)
Condition: $`ErrorInfo`.code$ != 0
Checks the connectorOutputPayload for empty payload; if yes, skips the curation logic.
Data mapping task
(Parse spec contents)
Input 1:
connectorOutputPayload (Fetch spec from GCS)
.GET_ELEMENT(
"0"
)
Output 1: gcsResponseTemp
Input 2:
gcsResponseTemp
.GET_PROPERTY(
"Content"
)
.TO_STRING()
.TO_BASE_64()
Output 2: specContent
Parses the API specification content from the connectorOutputPayload and encodes it to base64 format.
JavaScript task
(Enrich API metadata with spec contents)
Script:
/**
* Processes and curates API metadata with spec contents.
* @param {object} event
* The event object containing API data and spec content.
*/
function executeScript(event) {
let apiMetadata = event.getParameter('apiMetadata');
let specContent = event.getParameter('specContent');
// Initialize curatedAPIMetadata directly from apiMetadata
const curatedAPIMetadata = { ...apiMetadata
};
// Construct the 'spec' object efficiently
const spec = {
displayName: "open-api-spec",
specType: {
enumValues: {
values: [{
id: "openapi"
}]
}
},
contents: {
mimeType: "application/yaml",
contents: specContent,
},
};
// Create the specMetadata object
const specMetadata = {
// Ensure originalUpdateTime exists before assigning
// provide a fallback if needed
originalModifiedTime: curatedAPIMetadata.originalUpdateTime
|| new Date().toISOString(),
spec: spec,
};
// Initialize or update the specs array within the first version
// This assumes versions[0] always exists. Add checks if it might not.
if (!curatedAPIMetadata.versions ||
curatedAPIMetadata.versions.length === 0) {
curatedAPIMetadata.versions = [{
specs: []
}];
} else if (!curatedAPIMetadata.versions[0].specs) {
curatedAPIMetadata.versions[0].specs = [];
}
curatedAPIMetadata.versions[0].specs.push(specMetadata);
// Set the modified apiData parameter
event.setParameter('curatedAPIMetadata', curatedAPIMetadata);
}
The script demonstrates how the API metadata is enriched using the parsed specContent output from the Data Mapping task. The function constructs an updated curatedAPIMetadata object. It structures the provided specification content into a new spec object, identifies it as an OpenAPI YAML, and embeds it into a specMetadata object along with its modification timestamp. This specMetadata is then integrated into the specs array of the API's first version within curatedAPIMetadata , effectively linking the API proxy with its detailed specification. Finally, the enriched curatedAPIMetadata is returned through the event object for subsequent steps in the custom curation workflow.
JavaScript task
(Do not enrich API metadata)
Script:
function executeScript(event) {
// Retrieve the apiData parameter.
let apiMetadata = event.getParameter('apiMetadata');
// Set the curated API metadata parameter same as API data.
event.setParameter('curatedAPIMetadata', apiMetadata);
}
The script sets the curated API metadata parameter to be the same as the API data.
Data mapping task
(Set curated API data)
Input:
apiData
.SET_PROPERTY(
curatedAPIMetadataList,
"apiMetadataList.apiMetadata"
)
Output: apiData
Constructs the curated apiData which is configured as the response payload of the integration.
Test and publish the integration
With the configuration complete, you can now test the integration with a sample input to ensure it's working correctly before publishing it for use in API hub. To test the integration, click Test in the integration editor toolbar.

Now that you have successfully tested the integration, lets publish it to make it active and available for use in API hub. To publish the integration, click Publish in the integration editor toolbar.
Upon successfully publishing your integration, you can view and inspect the execution logs of the published integration. To view logs, click View execution logs for this integration.
Step 2: Set up custom curation in API hub
Now that your integration is published, it's time to connect your custom curation logic to API hub.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API hub page.
Go to API hub
Click Settings from the left navigation menu to open the Settings page.
Go to the Curations tab and click Set up a new curation .
In the Set up curation pane, provide the following details:
Display name: enter enrich-curation .
Description: enter Custom curation to enrich API using spec files in GCS bucket .
Under Associate an existing integration section:
Integration: choose enrich-with-spec-yaml .
Trigger ID: Choose api_trigger/test-custom-curation_API_1 .
Click Create curation to initiate the creation of the custom curation.
A Curation created successfully notification appears when complete.
Step 3: Edit existing plugin instance
API hub creates a default plugin instance for Apigee and Apigee hybrid upon provisioning. To apply your new logic, you will now edit this instance to use the custom curation you just created.
To edit the curation settings of the existing Apigee and hybrid plugin instance, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API hub page.
Go to API hub
Click Settings from the left navigation menu to open the Settings page.
Click the Plugins tab and go to the Manage instances section to view the list of plugin instances in your project.
Find the Apigee X and Hybrid plugin instance, click more_vert (Plugin instance actions) and then select See details .
In the Plugin details pane, modify the Curation logic to Custom curation and choose enrich-with-spec-yaml as the curation logic.
Click Save to apply your changes.
Step 4: Verify enriched API data
As the final step, lets verify that the custom curation is working as expected by checking API hub to see the newly enriched API data.
To verify the enriched data, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the APIs page in API hub .
Go to API hub
A list of all the available APIs are listed on the APIs home page.
Use Filter to filter the following list of APIs:
Orders API
Products API
Users API
Click an API to view the API details page. Verify the API details and check if it is enriched with the specification files from the Cloud Storage bucket.
The following image shows a sample products API with the enriched details:
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete individual resources
Delete the bucket:
gcloud storage buckets delete BUCKET_NAME
Important: Your bucket must
be empty before you can delete it.
