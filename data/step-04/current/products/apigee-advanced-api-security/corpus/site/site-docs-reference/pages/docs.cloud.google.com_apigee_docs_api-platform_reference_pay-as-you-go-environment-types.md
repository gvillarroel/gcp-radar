Apigee's Pay-as-you-go pricing attributes are based in part upon the environment types you attach
to your Apigee instance .
An environment is a unit of infrastructure within an organization where you can create
and deploy API proxies .
When you provision an Apigee organization using the Pay-as-you-go pricing model, an Intermediate environment is created in your organization.
After the organization is provisioned, you can add additional environments of any type to your organization.
The Apigee Pay-as-you-go pricing model introduces three different types of deployment environments, with varying costs:
Base environment
Intermediate environment
Comprehensive environment
With the ability to use multiple types of environments in a single organization, you can create a pricing scheme
tailored to your usage. This topic addresses the features, limitations, and recommended use cases for each
environment type.
Base environment type
When you select a Base environment to attach to your Apigee instance, you can do the following:
Deploy and run Standard API Proxies .
Utilize Apigee API monitoring and Cloud Monitoring .
Access Apigee proxy development tools.
Leverage other Google Cloud services.
Register your APIs with Apigee's API Hub (Preview) .
As the lowest-cost environment type, the Base environment is recommended for the following API management use cases:
Proxying API traffic for prototyping, internal development, or small-scale applications.
Onboarding your program to Apigee and maintaining low ongoing costs.
Implementing a fully-managed gateway with the option to add advanced capabilities when required.
Intermediate environment type
With an Intermediate environment attached to your Apigee instance, you can
access all the functionality of the Base environment type, along with the following:
Deploy and run Extensible API Proxies and Standard API Proxies.
Create API products and publish those products in a developer portal .
Access add-on Apigee capabilities available for purchase like Apigee API Analytics ,
Advanced API Security , and Monetization * .
With these expanded capabilities, the Intermediate environment is recommended for the following API management use cases:
Building and publishing API products for developers.
Managing a portfolio of APIs with growing adoption.
Performing complex transformations or mediations in your API traffic.
* The Monetization add-on is currently unavailable for purchase.
Comprehensive environment type
If you attach a Comprehensive environment to your Apigee instance, you can
access all the functionality of the Intermediate environment type, along with the ability to do following:
Perform at-scale deployments with multiple regions.
Purchase additional proxy deployments per environment.
Access high-performance operational tools like auto-scaling QPS, debug masking ,
and distributed tracing (Preview) .
The Comprehensive environment is recommended for API management use cases that require:
Supporting mission critical applications with high reliability and performance.
Maintaining precision control over API operations.

Add or remove environments
If you have an Apigee organization provisioned with Pay-as-you-go pricing, you can create
additional environments of any type, up to the limits specified in Comparison of environment types .
When you
create a new environment , you can deploy any existing proxies to the new environment. If an environment
is no longer required, you can undeploy your proxies and delete
the environment to prevent any Pay-as-you-go charges from accruing.
Update types for existing environments
Alternatively, you can upgrade or downgrade the type of an existing environment to add or remove feature capabilities and manage your Apigee Pay-as-you-go billing and resource usage.
For example, you can:
Upgrade a Base environment type to an Intermediate environment type to use Shared Flows in your deployments.
Downgrade an Intermediate environment that contains only Standard API proxies to a Base environment type
to decrease environment usage costs.
For more information on using the Apigee APIs or Apigee UI in the Google Cloud console to change the type of an existing environment, see
Update Pay-as-you-go environment types .
If your API management program grows beyond the capabilities provided by the Comprehensive environment type,
you can speak to your Google Cloud sales specialist about available
Subscription pricing plans .
