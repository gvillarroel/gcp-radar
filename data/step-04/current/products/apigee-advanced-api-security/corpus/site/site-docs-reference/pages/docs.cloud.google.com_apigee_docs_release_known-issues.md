Deployment disruption for Apigee Drupal Portal via Cloud Marketplace
We are transitioning the Apigee Drupal Portal Marketplace solution to use
Infrastructure Manager instead of Cloud Deployment Manager. During this transition
period, some deployment and management functionalities might be unavailable.
Impact:
New Deployments: Starting April 1, 2026, attempting to deploy a new Apigee Drupal
Portal instance using the "Deploy" button on the Cloud Marketplace might fail.
Existing Deployments: Your underlying resources (such as VMs and Cloud SQL
databases) are unaffected and will continue to run normally. However, using Deployment
Manager-based features to manage the deployment via the Cloud Marketplace UI or the
gcloud deployment-manager tool might fail.
Workaround: Perform any configuration changes or management tasks
directly on the individual Google Cloud resources (Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, etc.)
rather than through the Cloud Marketplace UI.

Deployment fails for MCP Discovery Proxies in regions with capacity limitations.
MCP infrastructure deployment may be subject to capacity limitations in the following regions:
asia-east2
asia-northeast3
asia-southeast2
australia-southeast1
europe-central2
europe-west12
europe-west9
me-central2
us-central2
If you see an error related to load balancer provisioning failure, or the provisioning status
never changes to Deployed , it might be due to temporary infrastructure capacity limits in
the selected region. Try deploying the proxy to an environment in a different region.

FIXED in 1.16.0-hotfix.1 and 1.15.2
Authenticated HTTP proxy configurations fail due to malformed URL strings in Helm templates.
When an authenticated outbound proxy is configured using httpProxy.username and httpProxy.password , Apigee Hybrid Helm charts generate malformed http_proxy and https_proxy strings. The templates incorrectly inject double-quotes into the middle of the URL, causing components like the guardrail validation pods to crash with a net/url: invalid userinfo error.
Workaround: Manually edit the Helm template files to remove the quote function from the username and password fields in the proxy URL construction. For example, in apigee-operator/templates/apigee-operators-guardrails.yaml , modify the proxy environment variable definitions to ensure the credentials are not individually quoted within the URL string.

hybrid 1.15.0 and later
FIXED in 1.16.0-hotfix.1
Proxy chaining fails with 404 route_not_found in multi-organization, single-namespace configurations.
In Apigee Hybrid environments where multiple organizations share a single Kubernetes namespace, proxy chaining may fail intermittently with an HTTP 404 route_not_found error. This occurs because the internal chaining gateways for different organizations use the same ingress_name selector, causing Envoy to inconsistently load routing rules.
Workaround: Assign a unique name to the chaining gateway for each organization in your overrides.yaml file to ensure selector isolation:
apigeeChainingGateway:
name: internal-chaining- UNIQUE_SUFFIX
Additionally, ensure that your virtual host selectors and any dedicated Kubernetes Services are updated to reference this unique name.

FIXED in hybrid 1.16.0-hotfix.1
apigee-operator-guardrails-sa not created on AKS/EKS with Federated Workload Identity.
The Kubernetes ServiceAccount apigee-operator-guardrails-sa is not created when installing or upgrading the apigee-operator chart in Apigee Hybrid 1.16.0 on non-GKE platforms where Federated Workload Identity (WIF) is enabled.
Workaround: Manually patch the apigee-operator Helm chart template:
Edit the apigee-operator Helm chart template file apigee-operator/templates/apigee-operator-guardrails-sa.yaml .
Update the initial if condition to include the check for federatedWorkloadIdentity :
{{ - if or (.Values.serviceAccountSecretProviderClass) (.Values.gcp.workloadIdentity.enabled) (.Values.gcp.federatedWorkloadIdentity.enabled) } }
Edit the apigee-operator Helm chart template file apigee-operator/templates/apigee-operator-guardrails.yaml ( Note: This is the apigee-operator-guardrails.yaml template file, not the apigee-operator-guardrails-sa file).
Update the initial if condition in line 17 immediately after the spec: to include the check for federatedWorkloadIdentity :
{{ - if or (.Values.serviceAccountSecretProviderClass) (.Values.gcp.workloadIdentity.enabled) (.Values.gcp.federatedWorkloadIdentity.enabled) } }
Apply the changes to the apigee-operator chart.

hybrid 1.16.0 (EKS with WIF and forward proxy)
FIXED in hybrid 1.16.0-hotfix.1
Unable to load API Products, Apps, and Developers after migrating data to Apigee Hybrid 1.16.
After upgrading to Apigee Hybrid 1.16.0, environments using Workload Identity Federation (WIF) in conjunction with an HTTP Forward Proxy may fail to load management entities (API Products, Apps, Developers) due to a credential casting regression in MART.
Workaround: Apply the 1.16.0-hotfix.1 update by updating the image.url and image.tag properties for the operator and MART components in your overrides.yaml file:
ao:
image:
url: "gcr.io/apigee-release/hybrid/apigee-operators"
tag: "1.16.0-hotfix.1"

Proxy deployment not completing due to missing RBAC permissions in Hybrid v1.16.0.
There is a known issue in 1.16.0 where Hybrid clusters may fail to report deployment status of proxies. This is due to a missing permission in the apigee-manager-role role.
Workaround: Add the permission to the apigee-operator helm chart template:
Edit the apigee-operator Helm chart template file apigee-operator/templates/apigee-operators.yaml .
Add the - watch verb to the deployments resource, after the - update verb on line 584.
Update the apigee-operator Helm release.

hybrid 1.14.x, hybrid 1.15.x
FIXED in hybrid 1.16.0
Apigee Hybrid versions 1.14 and 1.15 encounter a crash loop in the
apigee-ingressgateway-manager when
Kubernetes Gateway API v1.4.0 or newer is utilized.
Apigee Hybrid 1.16 is not affected by this issue.
Workaround: If you need to use the Kubernetes Gateway API with Apigee hybrid
versions 1.14 or 1.15, install version v1.3.x of the Gateway API. For example:
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.3.0/standard-install.yaml

Proxy calls fail with
The URI contain illegal characters error after
Netty upgrade.
In Apigee version 1-17-0-apigee-1, a Netty upgrade to 4.1.129.Final
introduced a regression. This can cause API proxy calls to fail with
a 400 status code and the error message
The URI contain illegal characters . This issue is
tracked externally in
netty/netty#16020 .

hybrid 1.14.3, hybrid 1.15.1, and hybrid 1.16.0 and later for upgrades
FIXED in hybrid 1.14.3, hybrid 1.15.1, and hybrid 1.16.0 for fresh installs
cert-manager versions 1.18+ changed the default for the private key rotation policy from Never to Always . If the private key for apigee-ca is rotated it will impact traffic
Note: This only applies to upgraded Apigee hybrid clusters. The certificates in fresh installs of the hybrid versions 1.14.3+, 1.15.1+, and 1.16.0. already have the rotation policy set to Never .
Newer versions of cert-manager (v1.18+) now automatically rotate the private keys. When this key is rotated for the apigee-ca certificate, it will cause an outage.
Workaround: To avoid this issue, you can choose one of the following options:
Do not upgrade cert-manager to a version higher than 1.17.x.
Edit the apigee-ca certificate in the cert-manager namespace and set spec.privateKey.rotationPolicy to Never . Use the following procedure to edit your apigee-ca certificate and upgrade cert-manager:
Warning: Performe these steps before upgrading cert-manager. Otherwise, you may trigger a certificate rotation.
Check the contents of your apigee-ca certificate to see if rotationPolicy is set:
Tip: If you are using a custom cert-manager namesspace, replace cert-manager with the correct namespace in the following commands.
kubectl get certificate apigee-ca -n cert-manager -o yaml
Look for the values under spec.privateKey in the output:
...
spec:
commonName: apigee-hybrid
duration: 87600h
isCA: true
issuerRef:
group: cert-manager.io
kind: ClusterIssuer
name: apigee-root-certificate-issuer
privateKey:
algorithm: ECDSA
# Note: rotationPolicy would appear here if it is set.
size: 256
secretName: apigee-ca
...
If rotationPolicy is not set or if it is set to Always , edit the apigee-ca certificate to set the value of rotationPolicy to Never :
Perform a dry run first:
kubectl patch Certificate \
--dry-run=server \
-n cert-manager \
--type=json \
-p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/privateKey/rotationPolicy", "value": "Never"}]' \
-o=yaml \
apigee-ca
Patch the certificate:
kubectl patch Certificate \
-n cert-manager \
--type=json \
-p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/privateKey/rotationPolicy", "value": "Never"}]' \
-o=yaml \
apigee-ca
Verify that the value of rotationPolicy is now set to Never :
kubectl get certificate apigee-ca -n cert-manager -o yaml
The output should look similar to the following:
...
spec:
commonName: apigee-hybrid
duration: 87600h
isCA: true
issuerRef:
group: cert-manager.io
kind: ClusterIssuer
name: apigee-root-certificate-issuer
privateKey:
algorithm: ECDSA
rotationPolicy: Never
size: 256
secretName: apigee-ca
...
Upgrade cert-manager. The following command will download and install cert-manager v0.14.2:
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/ v0.14.2 /cert-manager.yaml
See:

Message Processor returns 500 error with "Duplicate Header "authorization"" .
When multiple authorization headers are present in a request, the Apigee ingress gateway
doesn't concatenate them into a single header. This results in the Message Processor returning a 500
error with a "Duplicate Header "authorization"" message.
Workaround: If multiple authorization headers are present in the request,
concatenate them into a single header. For example:
curl -s https://my-hostname.net/mocktarget/echo \
-H 'authorization: a, b'

The Apigee UI does not offer the option of selecting a
Google-owned and Google-managed encryption key when provisioning subscription orgs.
Workaround : Use the Apigee APIs to create subscription-based
organizations with a Google-owned and Google-managed encryption key.
As mentioned in the
Apigee API documentation , while creating the Apigee organization, you can
create the organization using a Google-owned and Google-managed encryption key by not
supplying values for runtimeDatabaseEncryptionKeyName ,
apiConsumerDataEncryptionKeyName , and
controlPlaneEncryptionKeyName fields.

Apigee
FIXED in 1-16-0-apigee-3 or later
Following the upgrade to 1-16-0-apigee-3 , some Apigee organizations may encounter HTTP 500
errors stemming from a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError within a Java Callout policy. The error appears
similar to the following:
{ "fault" : { "faultstring" : "Failed to execute JavaCallout. org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils" , "detail" : { "errorcode" : "steps.javacallout.ExecutionError" }}}
This error occurs when a Java Callout policy incorrectly depends on libraries intended for Apigee's internal use
instead of providing its own dependencies.
Action required: To prevent this issue, developers must ensure that all Java Callouts
are self-contained and utilize their own dedicated libraries, avoiding any reliance on Apigee's internal class path.
In the API proxy that utilizes the Apache Commons JAR library, import the Apache Commons JAR
file to include as a resource for the proxy. For more information, see Java resource guidelines .

Apigee hybrid requires the mintTaskScheduler.serviceAccountPath property even when Monetization is not enabled.
Upgrading the apigee-org chart can fail if the mintTaskScheduler.serviceAccountPath property is not set, even if Monetization is not enabled:
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: execution error at (apigee-org/templates/mint-task-scheduler-gsa-secret.yaml:12:63): mintTaskScheduler.serviceAccountPath is required!
Workaround: Remove the apigee-org/templates/mint-task-scheduler-gsa-secret.yaml and apitee-org/templates/mint-task-scheduler-sa.yaml files.
You can optionally move the files to a separate location outside of the Helm chart directory. Alternatively you can download them again if you want to enable Monetization in the future, following the instructions in Step 2: Download the Apigee Helm charts .
For example, from the helm-charts/ directory:
ls apigee-org/templates/

Workaround: Patch _helper.tpl in the apigee-operator/ chart and reapply it.
Edit apigee-operator/templates/_helpers.tpl and remove the following bold lines:
{{- define "metricsSA" -}}
{{- $metricsName := "apigee-metrics" }}
{{- $telemetryName := "apigee-telemetry" -}}
{{- $generatedName := include "orgScopeEncodedName" (dict "name" .Values.org) -}}

{{- printf "%s-%s" $metricsName $generatedName -}}
{{- else -}}
{{- printf "%s-%s" $metricsName $telemetryName -}}
{{- end -}}

The use of wildcards ( * ) in Apigee proxy basepaths may conflict
with other explicit basepaths, resulting in a 404 error. For example, use
of the following basepaths for two proxies deployed in the same environment
may result in a 404 error when calling Proxy-2 :
Proxy-1: /a/v1/b
Proxy-2: /a/*/c
In this case, calls to the explicit base path will resolve successfully, but calls to the Proxy-2 may return a 404 , if
the wildcard path is evaluated as /a/v1/c .
Fixed: This issue is fixed in Apigee and in hybrid 1.14.3 and later. However, the fix is not enabled by default. If you wish to enable the use of wildcards in basepaths:
Customers with Apigee orgs should reach out to Apigee support to enable the fix if needed.

ENV_RELEASE_NAME is a name used to keep track of installation and
upgrades of the apigee-env chart. This name must be unique from the
other Helm release names in your installation. Usually this is the same as
ENV_NAME . However, if your environment has the same name
as your environment group, you must use different release names for the
environment and environment group, for example dev-env-release and dev-envgroup-release . For more information on releases in Helm, see
Three
big concepts in the Helm documentation.
ENV_NAME is the name of the environment you are upgrading.
OVERRIDES_FILE is your overrides file.

{"fault":{"faultstring":"SSL Handshake failed sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target","detail":{"errorcode":"messaging.adaptors.http.flow.SslHandshakeFailed"}}}
The error is intermittent because the keystore or truststore update may fail on one runtime pod but
succeed on other pods. To avoid this issue, update the keystore or truststore by creating
a new keystore or truststore. Repoint your reference to the new keystore or truststore, as
described in

Presence of istio.io Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in an Apigee hybrid cluster may cause failure in apigee-ingressgateway-manager pods.
During Apigee Hybrid upgrade from older versions to 1.14.2 or later, presence of existing istio.io CRDs may cause failed readiness probes in the discovery containers of the apigee-ingressgateway-manager pods.
Workaround: The istio.io CRDs are not required by Apigee hybrid v1.14.2 or newer. There are two options to fix this issue:
Delete the istio.io CRDs if you are not using Istio for any purpose other than Apigee in your cluster.
Update the apigee-ingressgateway-manager clusterrole to add permissions for istio.io .
Afer each of the above options, you will need to restart your apigee-ingressgateway-manager pods.
Delete CRDs
List the istio.io CRDs in your cluster to a CSV file:
kubectl get crd -o custom-columns=NAME:metadata.name | grep istio.io > istio-crd.csv
Optional: Save the CRDs locally in case you need to recreate them:
kubectl get crd $(cat istio-crd.csv) -o yaml > istio-crd.yaml
Delete the istio.io CRDs:
Dry run:
kubectl delete crd $(cat istio-crd.csv) --dry-run=client
Tip: You can use either --dry-run=client or --dry-run=server . See kubectl delete options for more information.
Execute:
kubectl delete crd $(cat istio-crd.csv)
Update clusterrole
Get the current apigee-ingressgateway-manager clusterrole:
kubectl get clusterrole apigee-ingressgateway-manager-apigee -o yaml > apigee-ingressgateway-manager-apigee-clusterrole.yaml

Helm release creation may fail when there are multiple virtual hosts.
Note: This has been fixed in version 1.14.2. Apigee recommends that you upgrade to version 1.14.2 or newer .
When there are multiple virtual hosts, the Helm release creation may fail due to conflicting ApigeeRoute names. The workaround is to run the following commands for every virtual host when creating:
kubectl annotate ar apigee-ingressgateway-internal-chaining- PROJECT_ID_SUFFIX -n APIGEE_NAMESPACE meta.helm.sh/release-name= NEW_ENV_GROUP_NAME --overwrite
kubectl annotate cert apigee-ingressgateway-internal-chaining- PROJECT_ID_SUFFIX -n APIGEE_NAMESPACE meta.helm.sh/release-name= NEW_ENV_GROUP_NAME --overwrite
where:
PROJECT_ID_SUFFIX is a unique suffix for internal chaining for your project in Kubernetes. You can find this suffix with the following command:
kubectl get svc -n apigee -l app=apigee-ingressgateway | grep internal-chaining
Your output will look something like:
kubectl get svc -n apigee -l app=apigee-ingressgateway | grep internal-chaining

In the example output, my-project--1234567 is the PROJECT_ID_SUFFIX .

Inaccuracies in Monetization rates around volume-band thresholds
Due to current design, inaccurate monetization rates may be assessed for
transactions that occur near a volume-band threshold. This manifests as too many
transactions being assessed at the pre-threshold rate, and is more likely to occur
when many transactions for a given developer and rate plan combination occur within
a 30 second window. This means that monetization reporting will over-report charges
with decreasing banded rates, and under-report charges when increasing banded rates.
This issue occurs in Apigee X and Apigee Hybrid and has no known workaround.

API Monitoring and Cloud Monitoring show abnormal spikes
API Proxy request and response counts (for proxy and targets) show abnormal spikes
Here is a sample showing such a spike:
( view larger image )
Due to a bug, the system registers the count incorrectly
for a brief period and the count is corrected. This happens
where there is a reduction in API traffic (which results in
a scale down of API gateways).
To distinguish actual spikes in requests vs. this issue,
please consult the API Analytics page (specifically the
Proxy Performance and Target Performance pages)
Affected Metrics:
apigee.googleapis.com/proxyv2/request_count
apigee.googleapis.com/proxyv2/response_count
apigee.googleapis.com/targetv2/request_count
apigee.googleapis.com/targetv2/response_count
New metrics
You can use the new metrics to avoid this issue.
Note: These metrics are currently available for Apigee and Apigee hybrid v1.12 and above. For Apigee hybrid v1.10 and v1.11, use the original metrics .
Metric
Description
apigee.googleapis.com/proxy/request_count
Number of requests to the Apigee proxy since the last sample was recorded.
apigee.googleapis.com/proxy/response_count
Number of responses sent by the Apigee API proxy.
apigee.googleapis.com/proxy/latencies
Distribution of latencies, which are calculated from the time the request was received by
the Apigee proxy to the time the response was sent from the Apigee proxy to the client.
apigee.googleapis.com/target/request_count
Number of requests sent to the Apigee target since the last sample was recorded.
apigee.googleapis.com/target/response_count
Number of responses received from the Apigee target since the last
sample was recorded.
apigee.googleapis.com/target/latencies
Distribution of latencies, which are calculated from the time the request was sent to
the Apigee target to the time the response was received by the Apigee proxy.
Time does not include the Apigee API proxy overhead.

If ServiceCallout is fire and forget (no
<Response> tag), a race condition can occur if
there is another policy that occurs after it.
Workaround: To maintain the fire and forget behavior:
Add <Response>calloutResponse</Response> to the ServiceCallout.
Set continueOnError to true .

Apigee
FIXED in Apigee 1-11-0-apigee-1
If there is more than one SpikeArrest policy in a bundle,
502 errors will occur.
Workaround: Avoid using more than one SpikeArrest policy
in the proxy to prevent the issue.

hybrid 1.5.0 and later Apigee
FIXED
Dynamic updates to rate in spike arrest may not reflect
immediately
For a particular key, if there is continuous traffic, the key
may not be rate limited at the updated rate. If there is five
minutes of no traffic for a particular key, the rate will be
reflected.
Workaround: Redeploy the proxy with a new reference
variable if the rate has to take effect immediately. Or use two
conditional spike arrests with different flow variables to adjust
the rate.

FIXED
Value of io.timeout.millis is not honored when
used with multiple dynamic targets.
If a proxy sets two or more io.timeout.millis
values in two or more flows using the same target host, only
one io.timeout.millis value is honored.

hybrid 1.8.x
FIXED
Apigee hybrid upgrade error can be ignored
During upgrade to Apigee hybrid 1.8.x, after running
apigeectl init and confirming that
check-ready succeeded, you may notice, if you
view the pods, that the Cassandra schema validation job is
in an error state. This is a harmless condition , and
you can safely move to the next step in the upgrade procedure.

An error should be, but is not, returned when deploying proxies with the same path to multiple environments
that are attached to the same instance and environment group
Deploying proxies with the same path to multiple environments that are attached to
the same instance and environment group is not allowed and should return a warning message
about a base path conflict. Instead, no error is shown and the deployments appear to
succeed.
Workaround: When deploying and after deployment, verify that there are not
base path conflicts with deployed proxies and correct as needed.

Apigee
FIXED
Some proxy deployment attempts return an error that the revision is immutable
When attempting to save a previously deployed proxy, the deployment might fail with
an error stating that the revision is immutable.
Workaround: Click the dropdown arrow next to the Save button and select
Save as new revision . Then reattempt the deployment.

Attempting to deploy more than 800 proxies to an environment group fails with an
error. The limit on which an error is returned is lower than 800 when the basepaths are longer
than 15 characters.

With gRPC proxy requests ,
gRPC trailers are removed from the response
When a call is made to a gRPC Target Server, the only trailer that's returned is the
"grpc-status" trailer. All other trailers are removed from the response.

Specs generated with Gemini Code Assist in Cloud Code that also include
non-ASCII UTF-8 characters are not parsed correctly when uploaded to API hub.
As a result API hub won't extract operations, definitions, and other metadata
correctly.

FIXED
Apps associated with an AppGroup do not appear in the Apps list in the
Apigee UI. As a result, users cannot access the app's App Detail
page in the console. Using search in the console with a partial app name or API key
search for the app is not supported until this issue is resolved. Apigee hybrid organizations are
not impacted by this problem, as they use the Classic UI to view the app details.
Partial workaround: A list of all apps is available using the APIs. See
organizations.apps.list .

Monetization Apigee hybrid
FIXED in hybrid 1.14.3, hybrid 1.15.1, hybrid 1.16.0
Recurring, setup, and top-up fee data not captured or billed for
hybrid organizations
For hybrid organizations with monetization, the recurring (RECURRING_FEE),
setup fee (SETUP_FEE) and top-up fee (TOPUP_FEE) data is not captured or billed for
post-paid billing. For pre-paid billing, the wallet deduction occurs for these fees
but is not reported.

Use separate target endpoint definitions for SSE (server sent-event) targets. Mixing
SSE and non-SSE target endpoints together might result in inconsistent behavior such

Previously undetected DNS configuration problems might now cause DNS errors. Apigee
removed the automatic DNS fallback functionality that was in 1-16-0-apigee-2. This
removal eliminates the platform's resiliency to DNS misconfigurations and might now
result in DNS errors.
Find related errors by checking the runtime logs for DNS resolution errors.
