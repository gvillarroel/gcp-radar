This section describes environments and environment groups.
Overview
An Apigee environment is a
software
environment , within an organization, for
creating
and deploying API proxies.
You must deploy an API proxy to an environment before it can be accessed. You can deploy an API
proxy to a single environment or to multiple environments.
Each environment is subject to limits on the number of API proxies, shared flows, and other resources that can be deployed to it.
These limits vary based on the Apigee organization type (Subscription, Pay-as-you-go, or Apigee hybrid) that uses the environment. For more detailed information, see the Limits documentation.
An environment group (sometimes called an envgroup in the Apigee API ) is the
basic mechanism for defining the way requests are routed to individual environments. You define
hostnames on your environment groups (not on individual environments), and Apigee
routes requests to the environments within a group using those hostname definitions.
An environment must be a member of at least one environment group before you can
access proxies deployed within it. In other words, you must assign an environment to a group
before you can use it.
The logical grouping of environments by environment group provides the following benefits:
Centralized hostname management: Environment groups provide a centralized
place to manage hostnames.
Aggregate insights: With groups, you can analyze errors by looking at
reports for an entire environment group at once rather than individual environments.
Conflict avoidance: By grouping environments, you can ensure that the
base paths for your deployed proxies exist under the same hostname.
Supported deployment types
Apigee supports the following deployment types in an environment:
Type
Description
Proxy
Develop and test your API proxies in your Apigee development environments, and then deploy them to Apigee integration test and production environments. See Deploying an API proxy .
Archive
Develop and test your programmable API proxies using Apigee in VS Code .
Summary of prevented actions with Archive deployment
When you enable Archive deployment in an Apigee environment, you will be prevented from performing the
following actions within the environment to prevent conflicts:
In the Apigee UI, you cannot view, confirm deployment status, or manage your Archive deployments, as described Deploying an API proxy , or use the Debug UI as described in Using Debug . As a workaround, you can use gcloud or the API to List all Archive deployments in an environment
and use the Debug API .
You cannot create, update, or delete resource files or target servers using the Apigee UI, API, or gcloud.
At this time, Google Authentication using Service Accounts is not supported.
Note : You can manage key value maps (KVMs),
and TLS keystores in an Apigee environment that is enabled for Archive deployment.
If you attempt to perform any of the prevented actions listed above, the action will fail with the following error message:
FAILED_PRECONDITION
Proxy deployment units
Proxy deployment units (PDUs) measure the consumption of your Apigee capacity based on the deployment of API proxies and shared flows across your infrastructure.
A proxy deployment unit is defined as one API proxy or shared flow revision deployment, per environment, per instance (region). Because Apigee scales with your infrastructure, a single proxy deployment can count as multiple units if it is deployed to an environment that spans multiple instances.
Calculating PDUs
The total PDUs are calculated by summing the deployment units across all environments in your organization. For each environment, the PDU contribution is the number of deployed revisions multiplied by the number of instances (regions) the environment is attached to.
The general formula for total PDUs is:
Total PDUs = Σ (Deployed Revisions in Env n × Instances for Env n )
Where the sum is over all environments (Env n ) where the proxy or shared flow is deployed.
If a proxy or shared flow is deployed to environments that are all attached to the same number of instances, a simplified formula can be used:
PDUs = (Deployed Revisions) × (Environments) × (Instances)
Examples
The following table provides examples of how PDUs are calculated in different infrastructure scenarios:

Proxy deployment unit types
Proxy deployment units count proxies and shared flows deployed to environments per region.
These are the deployment unit types:
Standard proxy deployment units count the number of currently deployed proxies that qualify as Standard proxies .
Extensible proxy deployment units count the number of currently deployed proxies that qualify as Extensible proxies .
Shared flow deployment units count the number of deployed shared flow .
Your usage might be subject to deployments quota , which is a limit on how many
deployment units you can use at a time. See your entitlements ( Pay-as-you-go or
Subscription 2024 ) for details. For information on system limits, see
Max proxy deployment units per instance.
For more information on viewing proxy deployment unit usage and deployments quota details for your organization, see
View proxy deployment usage .
Environment types
For Pay-as-you-go users, when you create an environment you will select the environment type:
Base , Intermediate , or Comprehensive .
Features, functionality, and costs associated with the environment depend on the environment type.
See
Pay-as-you-go environment types
and
Pay-as-you-go entitlements
for more information.
For Apigee subscription plans, your environment type is always Apigee Comprehensive and you do not need to
know about environment types.
Forward proxying
Apigee supports forwarding traffic to a specified URI. This feature applies at the
environment level and can be used to direct traffic to the internet after
initial processing in a proxy.
Incoming requests to proxies in the configured environment process for any
included policies (see
Forward proxying feature support ) and then
forward using HTTP to the new URI.
Changes made to the forward proxy setting of an environment are effective immediately for new
requests only. Requests already processing complete with the setting that was in
place when the request was received.
For instructions to configure forward proxying, see
Configure forward proxying in an environment .
Forward proxying feature support
Not all generally available proxy features have the same availability
or applicability with forward proxying.
Apigee does not currently support Basic Authentication with forward proxying, except in
Apigee Hybrid.

Key points
The following table lists important points to remember about environments, organizations,
and environment groups:
Element
Rules
Organizations
Can contain multiple environment groups
Must have at least one environment group
Environments
Must be in at least one environment group
Can be in more than one group
Share hostnames with all other environments in the same group
Can be used to forward traffic to a specified URI
Environment Types
Determine the functionality available in and with that environment
Determine the pricing for the environment
(See Environment types .)
Environment Groups
Can have multiple hostnames
Contain one or more environments
Hostnames assigned to a group must be unique to that group (they cannot be
used by other groups)
Apigee Hybrid users: Every environment group you create with an
attached environment must be included in all override files where the environment is used.
Examples
The following sections show common ways in which environments are structured within environment
groups.
One environment group and one environment
The simplest structure is a single environment group with a single environment in it.
This is common for organizations that are currently evaluating the product or have not yet set up
testing or analytics infrastructure, nor have any proxies deployed in production.
Multiple environments in a single environment group
An environment group can contain multiple environments. For example,
a single environment group, prod-group , can contain three environments,
cart-prod , catalog-prod , and payment-prod .
The environment group has a single hostname, example.com . You can use the
hostname to route requests to a proxy deployed in any of the environments. Note that
hostnames are defined
on the environment group level: they do not route to a specific environment.
See Working
with environment groups to learn how to create this environment group.
Restricting routing to a single environment
In the previous example, requests can be routed to proxies in all three environments by a single
hostname. If you want to restrict access to proxies in a single environment, say
catalog-prod , create another environment group that contains only
the environment catalog-prod . Then a hostname defined for that environment group
can only access catalog-prod .
For example, the hostname catalog.example.com ,
for the environment group catalog-prod-group , can
only route requests to proxies in the environment catalog-prod .

Routing and base paths
In a simple configuration, a request to a deployed API proxy is made up of a hostname, base
path, and the name of an API resource; for example:
https://www.example.com/shopping/cart/addItem
|_____________| |___________| |_____|
| | |
hostname basepath resource
You define hostnames on the environment group so that multiple environments can share them.
Basepaths and API resources are defined on the API proxy.
Note: The environment and group names do
not affect the URL of the API endpoint. They are meant only for you to organize and configure your
environments, and are not exposed to the proxy's end users.
For more information about base paths and API resources, start with
Understanding routes .
In addition, check out the Flow configuration reference and Flow variables reference to
gain a greater understanding of how these pieces fit together.
Hostnames
When you create an environment group, you attach one or more hostnames to that group. For
example, you might have the following environment groups, each with its own hostnames:
Environment Group Name (Environments)
prod-group (catalog-prod cart-prod pymnt-prod)
dev-group (dev-env)
test-group (test-env)
Hostnames
catalog.example.com payment.example.com
dev.example.com
test.example.com
You define base paths on the proxy when you
create it .
When you deploy a proxy to an environment within the group, the
hostname plus the base path and the resource name together define the endpoint of an API
request to that proxy.
You can define more than one hostname on an environment group. They can all be used to call any
proxy deployed to any environment in the group. For example, catalog.example.com/proxy1
and payment.example.com/proxy1 will both call the proxy1 resource if
the hostnames catalog.example.com and payment.example.com are defined on
the same environment group.
Routing example
For example:
The prod-group environment group contains the following environments:
catalog-prod
cart-prod
pymnt-prod
The prod-group has the following hostnames defined on it:
catalog.example.com
payment.example.com
The following proxies are deployed to these environments:
The catalog proxy on catalog-prod with a base path of
/catalog
The cart proxy on cart-prod with a base path of
/catalog/cart
The payment proxy on pymnt-prod with a base path of
/payment
This creates the following endpoints:
catalog.example.com/catalog routes to the
catalog proxy in the catalog-prod environment.
catalog.example.com/catalog/cart routes to the
cart proxy in the cart-prod environment.
payment.example.com/payment routes to the
payment proxy in the pymnt-prod environment.
The following example shows that the requests are routed to different proxies that are deployed
to environments within the group, matching any of the hostnames and the base path:
Tip: The hostnames that you define on an environment group:
Must be unique across all environment groups in an organization; they cannot be used by more
than one group
Do not support wildcards
Base paths must be unique within an environment group (no two proxies can have the same base path within
an environment group)
For more information, see
Adding
hostnames to a group .
Shared environments and routing
An environment can belong to multiple environment groups. If you deploy a proxy to such an
environment, the proxy will have a multiple addresses, one for each environment group the
environment belongs to. This is useful if a customer has wildcard certificates (like
*.example.com) for multiple partners.
For example:
shared-env belongs to two environment groups:
partner-1 with host alias api.partner-1.com
partner-2 with host alias api.partner-2.com
Proxy foo is deployed to shared-env with a base path
/foo . Because shared-env is shared by both environment groups,
foo has two addresses:
api.partner-1.com/foo
api.partner-2.com/foo
Note that both of the hostnames route to the same environment. This gives each
environment group
a unique domain name. For Apigee Hybrid, this scenario can use mTLS with
a different certificate for each partner.
-->
About environment scope
The organization provides scope for some Apigee capabilities. For example, key-value-map (KVM)
data can be made available at the organization level, meaning that API proxies deployed to any
environment within that organization can access the same KVM data.
Similarly, some capabilities can be scoped to environments or environment groups within the
organization. For example, Apigee analytics data is partitioned by a combination of organization,
environment, and (eventually) environment group.
Considerations
Every deployment to an environment has the potential to affect the routing of traffic for every
environment group to which that environment is attached. When new basepaths are added, they may
start capturing entirely new traffic, or they may start capturing a subset of existing traffic
already being handled by an existing deployment.
Similarly, when basepaths are removed, they may correspond to endpoints that no longer receive
any traffic, or they may cause existing traffic to be rerouted to a different proxy. When traffic
is rerouted, it may be to a proxy in the same environment, or when multiple environments share
a single environment group, it may be to a proxy in a different environment.
The total number of API proxy basepaths added to an environment, or environment group, should also be
considered. For optimal performance, Apigee recommends using no more than 3,000 API proxy basepaths per Apigee environment
or environment group. Exceeding this recommendation can result in increased latency for all new and existing API proxy deployments.
