— Shadow API Discovery
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Shadow API Discovery finds shadow APIs (also known as undocumented APIs) in your existing cloud
infrastructure. Shadow APIs pose a security risk to your system, since they might be
unsecured, unmonitored, and unmaintained. Shadow API Discovery is part of
API Observation in Apigee .
You can configure and run jobs to observe API activity in individual Google Cloud projects.
Within your centralized Apigee API hub instance,
you can attach those projects to view the results of those jobs and automatically compare them to
"known" APIs documented in API hub. For information on using Shadow API Discovery in Apigee API hub, see
API observations in API hub .
For information on data residency compatibility for Shadow API Discovery, see
Data residency compatibility .
Enable Shadow API Discovery
Shadow API Discovery is part of the Advanced API Security add-on and is available for
Google Cloud projects with or without Apigee provisioning.
If your Google Cloud project is provisioned for Apigee :
For subscription customers, it's available with the Apigee organization. See
Manage Advanced API Security for Subscription organizations
Pay-as-you-go customers must enable the add-on for at least one environment. See
Manage Advanced API Security for Pay-as-you-go organizations
Shadow API Discovery is not available for Apigee eval environments.
If your Google Cloud project is not provisioned for Apigee, you can
add Shadow API Discovery to your project by contacting Apigee Sales .
Important: Active Shadow API Discovery jobs also incur costs based on the
volume of monitored traffic. See the "Using a Private Service Connect backend (load balancer) to
access a published service" section of
Private Service Connect forwarding rules
for information on costs. To eliminate these costs, disable the Shadow API Discovery
job or jobs.
Enable Shadow API Discovery from Apigee
Instructions in this section for setting up and viewing the results of API observations are based
on the Apigee UI in Cloud console. You can also use the Apigee Management (APIM) APIs to manage
Shadow API Discovery. See
Shadow API discovery management APIs .
To use this feature,
you must enable the add-on. If you are a Subscription customer, you can enable the
add-on for your organization. See
Manage Advanced API Security for Subscription organizations for more details. If
you are a Pay-as-you-go customer, you can enable the add-on in your eligible environments. For more information, see
Manage the Advanced API Security add-on .

Access Shadow API Discovery in the Apigee UI
This section describes how to access Shadow API Discovery in the Apigee UI.
To access Shadow API Discovery in the Apigee UI:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > API Observation > Shadow API page.
Go to Shadow API
The main page shows any API observations that were already generated. Select the
API Observations and Observation Jobs tabs to switch between
viewing results
and creating observation jobs .
Create observation jobs
Observation jobs provide the instructions Shadow API Discovery needs to look for shadow APIs. Follow
these steps to create an observation job. Be aware of the
Behaviors and limitations that apply to observation
job creation.
Select the Observation jobs tab and then click Create observation job .
Select one or more Observation sources(s) , or click Create observation
source at the bottom of the Observation source(s)
list to create new source locations if needed. Note that the observation source creation
process might take several minutes.
Observation sources include: Source name: A name you specify to identify the source.
Location: A location
to observe in. Including more source regions allows a broader view of APIs across your
infrastructure. See Best practices . Only one observation
source can be created in a location.
Network and Subnetwork: The VPC network and subnetwork. The network and
subnetwork must be in the same project as the observation source. The subnetwork must also
be in the same region as the observation source location.
Create observation job . Provide an observation job name, which must be unique per
location. Select a location, which specifies where data aggregation and processing will
occur. All data collected in the source regions is processed in and accessed from this
region, consistent with
Google's Data Residency policies .
Creating a new observation job may take a few minutes to complete.
Enable observation job (Optional) . You can enable the job when you create it, in
which case it starts observing immediately. If you do not enable the job immediately, you
can enable the observation job later
from the observation job list.
Enable, disable, and delete observation jobs
To change whether an existing observation job is enabled (active), select either Enable
or Disable from the Actions menu in the row for that job in the Observation jobs
page.
To delete an existing observation job, select Delete from the Actions menu for
that job. Deleting a job also removes the observation results associated with the job, so if
you'd like to preserve the results while stopping the job from continuing, disable it rather
than deleting it. Active jobs cannot be deleted; disable active jobs first if you need to
delete them.
Note: You can't edit an observation job at this time. See
Behaviors and limitations .
View API Observations
To view API Observations for enabled observation jobs, choose the
API Observations tab and then select the Observation job from the list.
Note: Observation jobs do not generate results immediately and
are subject to limitations. See
Behaviors and limitations for details.
The observations list shows these values:
Hostname: The API hostname. Click the hostname to
view the observation details .
API operations: The number of API operations (such as GET or PUT requests) observed.
Server IPs: IPs of servers hosting the discovered APIs.
Source locations: The source location(s) where traffic was observed.
Last event detected (UTC): The date and time when the most recent request to the API
was detected.
Tags: A list of the tags you or someone else created to label this observation. See
Use tags for more information.
Actions: Additional actions available for each observation.
View observation details
After clicking the hostname on the
observations list , you'll see the observation
details page.
This page includes the following information about the observation.
The summary box at the top of the page shows:
API observation ID: This is an Apigee-specific identifier.
API operations: See
View API observations for a
description of this field.
Create time (UTC): The date and time the observation job was created.
Tags: Use tags to organize observation job results.
Last event detected time: See
View API observations for a
description of this field.
A table of specific API operations detected on this discovered API. For each request, the
following information is shown:
Path: The request path.
Method: The request method (such as GET, PUT, etc.).
Count: The number of requests to that path with that method.
Transaction request: The request body from traffic data. Includes the request
headers and corresponding transaction counts for this API operation.
Transaction response headers: The response headers from traffic data. Includes
the response headers and corresponding transaction counts for this API operation.
Transaction response codes: The response codes and corresponding counts of
responses with that code for this API operation.
First seen (UTC): The first date and time that the request to this API Operation
was observed.
Last seen (UTC): The most recent date and time that the request to this API
Operation was observed.
Use tags
Tags allow you to categorize observation results. Tags are metadata and are for your
tracking only; tags do not change anything in the
observation results or trigger any actions. For example, adding a "Needs attention" tag does
not create any notices or alerts. New observation results do not have tags.
Tags have these characteristics:
You can add the same tag to multiple observation results.
Tag names can include upper and lower case characters, numbers, and special characters, including spaces.
Once a tag is created, the name cannot be changed; remove and recreate the tag to rename
it.
Removing a tag from all observation results deletes it from the system.
You can manage tags from either the observation list or the observation details page.
To manage tags from the
API observations list :
See the existing tags in the observations list Tags column.
To manage tags for one result, select Manage tags from the Actions menu in
the row for that result.
To manage tags for one or more results at the same time, select multiple results from the list
and then Manage tags from the top of the list.
To manage tags from the API observation details :
See the existing tags in the Tags section.
To add or manage tags, choose Manage tags at the top of the page.
In the Manage tags side panel, to add tags, either select existing tags or add new ones.
To remove tags, unselect them. Click Save to save the new tags.
Access Shadow API Discovery from API hub
For information on accessing Shadow API Discovery from API hub, see
Manage API Observation in API hub .
Best practices
We recommend these practices when working with Shadow API Discovery:
Follow your organization's Data Residency rules to ensure compliance with any applicable
regulations and laws.
Aggregate from as many source regions as possible to get the best cross-regional
correlation. Including more source regions in your observation jobs results in a broader
view of APIs across your infrastructure.
Behaviors and limitations
This section lists behaviors and limitations that apply to Shadow API Discovery:
Use of Shadow API Discovery does not guarantee observation of 100% of traffic or
discovery of all shadow APIs.
Shadow API Discovery finds Shadow APIs on your Google Cloud infrastructure only.
Observation jobs and sources must be configured in the same project where the VPC
network and subnetwork are set up.
Shadow API Discovery supports only External and Internal
Application Load Balancers at this time. Network Load Balancers are not
supported.
Shadow API Discovery finds HTTP protocol APIs, not gRPC.
Running API observation jobs on load balancers does not have any latency impact on
API traffic.
Warning: Shadow API Discovery supports load balancers on one network per project. If you
enable Shadow API Discovery on a project with multiple networks, you might see unexpected
behavior.
There must be traffic flowing through load balancers in your observed projects in
order to detect Shadow APIs.
It can take up to 30 minutes for a newly enabled observation job to detect traffic,
depending on the traffic volume. Sparse traffic requires longer observation times
before results are available.
Per region, there is a limit of a single observation source and a maximum of three
observation jobs. If you need more than three observation jobs, please contact
Google Cloud Customer Care to discuss the use case.
Observation jobs can be created and disabled or deleted, but not edited. If you need
to change an observation job, delete it and recreate it.
The following regions are currently supported for API observation and Shadow APIs:
australia-southeast1
europe-west2
europe-west9
us-central1
us-east1
us-west1
