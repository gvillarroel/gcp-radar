This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
Consider the following product configuration limits as you build, manage, and review
your API program implementation. We've designed the Apigee product for stability and performance
when configured within these limits. Customers are responsible for tracking
and ensuring they stay within the configuration limits. Customers exceeding the limits may
experience one or more of these types of symptoms: high API latencies, low API throughput,
and failing API calls. Customers filing support cases related to issues caused by limit
exceptions may be asked to make necessary modifications to their configuration.
Limits may or may not be enforced automatically (see the Currently enforced? column below).
As and when we automate limit enforcement for a limit currently not enforced, we will use
commercially reasonable efforts to notify affected customers so they can take corrective
actions in advance of such enforcement.
Some limits differ between Apigee and Apigee hybrid. The limits can
also differ based on your Apigee subscription type. If you are using Apigee hybrid, the higher
limits enabled by Subscription 2024 require a newly provisioned using hybrid version 1.14. or later. See
Enhanced per-environment proxy limits for details.
Note: This page describes technical configuration limits . Enforced limits are
fixed and cannot be changed or increased for individual organizations or
environments. Organization entitlement terms apply to all usage; exceeding entitlement limits can increase costs, even
if usage is within the limits described on this page. See Apigee Pricing for details and pricing options.

Private Service Connect
Private Service Connect Network Endpoint Groups (NEGs) for northbound connections
As of October 10, 2024, Apigee does not limit the number of Cloud projects that can connect to
an Apigee instance through Private Service Connect; however, Google Cloud Private Service Connect quota limits apply. Previously, the
limit was 50 projects. For each project, you can now create up to 100 Private Service Connect NEGs. The previous
limit was 20. For any Apigee instances created before October 10, 2024, you must
update the consumer accept list for an Apigee instance
if you want to take advantage of these new limits.
If you need to have more than 1000 Private Service Connect NEG connections in total across all of the
Cloud projects connected to an Apigee instance, contact Google Cloud Support .
