Preview — Advanced API Security Actions
This feature is covered by the Pre-GA Offerings Terms
of the Google Cloud Terms of Service. Pre-GA features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA features
may not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Support for the Preview launch of Advanced API Security Actions is available through
the
Apigee - Google Cloud Community forum.
This page describes how to manage security actions using the Apigee Management APIs. For an
overview of the security actions functionality, including limitations and latencies, see the
Security actions overview and UI .
You can access all of the security actions features through the
Apigee Management APIs . See the
Security Actions API reference for information on all of the available commands. This page
shows examples of some of the available commands.
Variables used in examples
The examples on this page can include these variables:
ORG is the organization.
ENV is the environment for the security action.
ACTION_NAME is the name of the security action.
Configure multiple condition types
You can include one or two condition types (such as IP address lists and ASN numbers) in a single
security action.
Note: Configuring two condition types in a security action is available
when configuring the security action via the API, not via the UI, at this time.
Important: This feature is available in Apigee hybrid starting
with version 1.16.0.
To configure a security action with two condition types, include multiple condition keys
within the conditionConfig object. For example:
"conditionConfig" : { "ipAddressRanges" : [ "100.0.225.0" ], "asns" : [ "10578" ]}
This example shows two condition types in a deny action:
curl -X POST "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityActions?security_action_id= ACTION_NAME " \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"state": "ENABLED", "deny": {"responseCode": 404}, "conditionConfig": {"ipAddressRanges": ["100.0.225.0"], "asns": ["10578"]}}'
Create security actions
This section provides examples for how to create security actions with different action types.
Create a deny action
To create a deny action, enter a command similar to the following:
curl -X POST "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityActions?security_action_id= ACTION_NAME " \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"state": "ENABLED", "deny": {"responseCode": 404}, "conditionConfig": {"ipAddressRanges": ["100.0.225.0"]}}'
This creates a security action that denies access to requests to the IP addresses listed in
ipAddressRanges
and returns a response code 404 .
Create a flag action
To create a flag action, enter a command similar to the following:
curl -X POST "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityActions?security_action_id= ACTION_NAME " \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"state": "ENABLED", "flag": {"headers": [{"name": "senseflag", "value": "flagvalue"}]}, "conditionConfig": {"ipAddressRanges": ["100.0.230.0"]}}'
This creates a security action that flags requests from the IP addresses listed in
ipAddressRanges and adds a header senseflag with value flagvalue .
Create an allow action
To create an allow action, enter a command similar to the following:
curl -X POST "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityActions?security_action_id= ACTION_NAME " \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"state": "ENABLED", "allow": {}, "conditionConfig": {"ipAddressRanges": ["100.0.220.0", "200.0.0.0"]}}'
This creates a security action that allows requests from the IP addresses listed in
ipAddressRanges .
Edit security actions
This section provides an example for how to edit an existing security action configuration. See
Enable or disable a security action or
Delete a security action to see examples for those types
of changes.
Edit a deny action
This section shows an example for editing a deny action. The APIs also support editing the other
action types .
update_mask can include any of these options: description,condition_config,
api_proxies,expire_time,ttl,flag,allow,deny,* (everything), or omitted
(defaults to everything).
See the
Security Actions API reference documentation for more information about potential values
when editing actions.
curl -X PATCH "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityActions/ ACTION_NAME ?update_mask=deny,conditionConfig" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d '{"deny": {"responseCode": 404}, "conditionConfig": {"ipAddressRanges": ["100.0.230.0"]}}' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
{
"name": " ACTION_NAME ",
"state": "ENABLED",
"createTime": "2022-12-29T18:28:50Z",
"updateTime": "2022-12-29T18:28:50Z",
"conditionConfig": {
