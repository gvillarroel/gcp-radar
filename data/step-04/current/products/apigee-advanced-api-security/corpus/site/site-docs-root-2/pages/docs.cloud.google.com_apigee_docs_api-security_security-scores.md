Risk assessment overview and UI
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
Overview
Advanced API Security risk assessment continuously evaluates API proxy
configurations and calculates security scores to help identify and address
vulnerabilities in your APIs.
Risk assessment helps you:
Enforce consistent security standards across all APIs.
Detect misconfigurations in API setups.
Improve your overall security score with recommended actions.
Quickly investigate and resolve security issues via a centralized dashboard.
In addition to assessing the current risk of each proxy, risk assessment can be used to monitor
the security posture of your APIs over time. An assessment score that fluctuates could indicate
that the API behavior is frequently changing, including proxies deployed without
necessary security policies, shared flow modifications via flow hook deployments and FlowCallout
policy additions, and target server changes in environment or proxy deployments.
You can access risk assessment either through the Apigee UI, as described on this page,
or through the
Security scores and profiles API . You can also use Terraform to configure security profiles and monitoring conditions .
See
Required roles for risk assessment for the roles needed to perform risk assessment tasks.
Tip: You can also use Advanced API Security in
Apigee API hub to assess risk across your API landscape. For information and usage, see
Advanced API Security for
multi-gateway projects .
Enable Risk Assessment
To use this feature,
you must enable the add-on. If you are a Subscription customer, you can enable the
add-on for your organization. See
Manage Advanced API Security for Subscription organizations for more details. If
you are a Pay-as-you-go customer, you can enable the add-on in your eligible environments. For more information, see
Manage the Advanced API Security add-on .
Advanced API Security, you will need to re-enable it by running the command shown in
Enable Advanced
API Security for Subscription organizations again, before you can view security scores for the new environment.
Risk Assessment v1 and v2
Risk Assessment is available in two versions: Risk Assessment v2 ,
and Risk Assessment v1 . Use v2 where possible. Use of
either version requires the Advanced API Security add-on .
The main feature differences between v1 and v2 are:
v2 includes:
Improved reliability, including faster score calculations with recent proxy data
Score calculation without the need to first attach a security profile to an environment
Simplified score presentation, based on a 0% to 100% scale
The concept of assessment check weights, which v1 does not support. See
Risk assessment concepts and scoring .
Additional assessments over v1, which check more policies when calculating scores.
For example, v1 supports five authorization and authentication-related policies while v2 supports eight. Also,
v2 includes a Traffic Management category with associated policies and performs additional
checks in policies, including for the continueOnError attribute.
Checks of nested shared flows and flow hooks to five levels of nesting. v1
does not evaluate policies included via shared flow chaining.
Replacement of target scores (target server scores) with proxy-based assessments and
recommendations. If a Target is used in a proxy, the security scores for that proxy include
the score for the Target Server as well.
Custom profiles using the new v2 assessment checks as well as the google-default
system profile.
Monitoring of security scores and metrics over time using Cloud Monitoring and
setting up alerts using Cloud Monitoring alerts .
Integration with Apigee API hub.
v2 does not support source assessment based on abusive traffic.
Risk Assessment v2
This section describes Risk Assessment v2. Some Risk
Assessment concepts and behaviors differ between v1 and v2. For usage with Risk Assessment v1, see
Risk Assessment v1 instead.
Risk Assessment v2 concepts and scoring methodology
Risk assessment security scores assess the security risk of your APIs based on the
scoring of security assessments and weights in a security profile.
Risk assessment scoring is based on:
Assessments and assessment checks: The individual checks performed against proxies, and
on which proxies are scored. Each check also has a weight , which gives a check more or
less significance when assessed against a proxy. Weights are set at minor, moderate, or
major for each check. Each weight has a point value which is used to calculate a score:
Minor: 1
Moderate: 5
Major: 15
Security profile: A collection of assessment checks,
against which deployed proxies in an environment are assessed.
Security score: The score for a proxy after assessment against a security profile.
The score is a value between 0% and 100%. 100% indicates that the proxy is fully compliant with
the assessment and no risks were found based on the assessment checks.
The security score is essentially the total of all points awarded for passed assessment checks
divided by the total potential points in the profile. The score is a weighted average, so the
more policies the security profile has, the less impact each assessment check has on the
security score. The assessment check weight also impacts the security score. Higher
weights have more impact on the calculation and lower weights have less impact, using the point
value for each weight. If the weights are equal for all assessment checks in the security profile
(such as when all assessment checks have a medium weight) then the security score is calculated
as a regular average.
Severity: A severity value for each assessed proxy, based on the security score.
The potential severity values are high (0-50%),
medium (51-90%), low (91-99%), and minimal (100%/no risk found based on the assessments in the
assigned security profile).

Policy attachment and proxy security scores
For proxy assessments, security scores are based on the policies you are using.
How those policies are assessed depends on whether and how they are attached to flows:
Only policies that are attached to a flow (preflow,
conditional flow ,
post flow in proxies,
or shared flow) affect scores. Policies that are not attached to any flow do not
affect scores.
Proxy scores take into account shared flows a proxy calls
via flow hooks and
FlowCallout
policies in the proxy, provided the FlowCallout policy is attached to a flow.
However, if the FlowCallout
is not attached to a flow, policies from its linked shared flow do not affect security scores.
Chained shared flows are evaluated up to five levels deep. Any policies included directly in the
proxy and in the first five levels of shared flows are counted towards the security score.
For policies attached to conditional flows, security scores only take into account
whether the policies are present; it does not take into account whether or how the policies
are enforced at runtime.
Security profiles v2
A security profile is a set of
security assessments and weights
to score API proxies against. You can use either Apigee's default
security profile , called google-default , or you can create a
custom security profile
that contains only the security categories and weights you want to assess.
When working with security profiles or creating custom security profiles, note that multiple
assessment checks within a category are assessed individually.
For example, if there are three authentication policy checks in a security profile
and the assessed proxy includes one of the three, the assessment score will include full
points for the one found policy and zero points for the other two policies which are not present.
In this example, the assessed proxy would not receive full points for authentication policy checks
even though it does include an authentication policy. Be
careful about security score interpretation and security profile design given this behavior.
Default security profile
Advanced API Security provides a default security profile that contains all of the
assessments. When you use the default profile, security scores are based on all of the categories.
The default security profile, google-default , can't be edited or deleted.
Custom security profile
You can create custom security profiles that include only your chosen assessment checks and weights to
evaluate against proxies. For instructions on creating and using
custom security profiles from the Apigee UI, see
Manage custom profiles in the Apigee UI .
Assessment checks in a custom security profile are "AND" assessments. See
Risk assessment concepts and scoring for more
information.
In some cases you might want to use a custom security profile to create an "OR" condition between
assessment checks. For example, you might want to create a profile that requires either an OAuth
policy or an API Key policy for authentication. While you can't, at this time, create a true "OR"
condition where the presence of either policy results in a score of 100%, you can use a custom
security profile to signal whether one or both policies are present.
For example:
Create a custom profile with the following checks and weights:
OAuthV2 policy check: Major
VerifyAPIKey policy check: Minor
With this configuration, the scores are:
100% if both policies are present
94% if only the OAuthV2 policy is present
6% if only the VerifyAPIKey policy is present
0% if neither policy is present
Use the scores to determine which policies are configured in the proxies.
Additionally, create a monitoring condition and a Cloud Monitoring Alert to set an alert to
trigger if the score goes below 6%. Above 6% it means the proxy has either the OAuthV2 policy or
the VerifyAPIKey policy (or both). Below 6%, no policy exists, which needs the user attention.
Use the name and description of the alert to indicate if one or both policies are missing. See
the example in
Example: Create a risk assessment monitoring condition monitoring alert .
For custom security profiles:
The profile name (also called the profile ID) is required and is shown in the summary
table when listing profiles. The name must be 1 to 63 characters, which can be lower case
letters, numbers 0-9, or hyphens. The first character must be a lower case letter. The last
character must be a lower case letter or number. Custom security profiles must have unique names
and can't duplicate existing profile names.
The profile description is optional and can't exceed 1,000 characters.
Monitoring conditions and alerts
Advanced API Security allows you to add monitoring conditions to Risk Assessment.
Once you create a monitoring condition, Risk Assessment publishes security score metrics to Cloud
Monitoring. Cloud Monitoring can
track security scores over time for proxies assessed against security profiles.
To use monitoring conditions:
Familiarize yourself with the Cloud Monitoring functionality.
Make sure you have the required roles or permissions needed to manage monitoring conditions. See
Required roles for Risk Assessment .
Use the Apigee UI or API to create and manage monitoring conditions. See
Manage monitoring conditions and alerts in the Apigee UI
and
Manage monitoring conditions in the API .
Note: When a new monitoring condition is created or an existing monitoring condition is changed, it
takes up to 5 minutes for the changes to be reflected in Cloud Monitoring metrics.
Once you've created a monitoring condition, you can set up monitoring alerts on the condition metrics,
using Cloud Monitoring alerts .
To create monitoring alerts from the Apigee UI,
see Manage monitoring conditions and alerts in the Apigee UI .
For information on alerts in Advanced API Security and how to manage the monitoring alerts, see
Security alerts .
Limitations and known issues on Risk Assessment v2
Security scores have the following limitations and known issues:
Security scores are only generated if an environment has deployed proxies.
Newly deployed proxies and newly enabled organizations and environments do not immediately
show scores. See Data delays for information.
For custom profiles, you can create a maximum of 100 custom profiles per organization.
Notification of new assessment calculations and scores is not supported at this time.
Only one monitoring condition can exist for a scope and security profile combination. If a profile
is already part of an existing monitoring condition for the scope selected, then a warning message
appears and prevents creation of the new condition.
Only deployed proxies are monitored. If a proxy that is included in a monitoring condition is
undeployed, it isn't monitored and doesn't show as monitored in the monitoring condition details.
On redeploy, the proxy is automatically monitored and shows as monitored in the monitoring
condition details.
You can create a maximum of 1,000 security monitoring conditions per organization.
New scores that are tracked by a security monitoring condition might take up to 5 minutes to
show in Cloud Monitoring.
Security scores are available in Cloud Monitoring for up to 6 weeks. See
Data retention .
Data delays
The data that Advanced API Security security scores have the following
processing windows before results are available:
When you enable Advanced API Security in an organization for the first time,
it takes time for the scores for existing proxies and targets to be
reflected in an environment. As a guideline, expect 30 to 90 minutes for Subscription
organizations and less time for Pay-as-you-go organizations.
New events related to proxies (deployment and undeployment) and
targets (create, update, delete) in an environment take at least 60 seconds and up to 5
minutes (for very large environments) to reflect in the environment's score.
View risk assessments in the Apigee UI
The Risk Assessment page displays scores that measure the security of your API in each
environment.

Risk Assessment v1
This section describes Risk Assessment v1. For information on Risk Assessment v2, see
Risk Assessment v2 instead.
Security scores
Security scores assess the security of your APIs, as well as their security posture over time.
For example, a score that fluctuates a lot could indicate that the API behavior is frequently
changing, which might not be desirable.
Changes in an environment that could cause the score to drop include:
Deploying many API proxies without the necessary security policies.
A spike in abuse traffic from malicious sources.
Observing changes to your security scores over time provides a good indicator of any unwanted or
suspicious activity in the environment.
Security scores are calculated based on your security profile ,
which specifies the security categories
you want your scores to evaluate. You can use Apigee's
default security profile, or you can create a custom security profile that includes only
the security categories that are most important to you.
Security scores assessment types
There are three assessment types that contribute to the overall security score calculated
by Advanced API Security:
Source assessment: Assesses the
detected abuse traffic, using the Advanced API Security
detection rules . "Abuse" refers to
requests sent to the API for purposes other than what the API is intended for.
Note: Source scores are calculated based on a time window
starting at 0:00 UTC on the current day and ending at the current time.
Proxy assessment: Assesses how well proxies have implemented
various security policies in the following areas:
Mediation: Check if one of the following mediation policies is configured for all
proxies in the environment:
OASValidation
or
SOAPMessageValidation .
Security:
Authorization: Checks if one of the following authorization policies is
configured for all proxies in the environment:
JWS or JWT
OAuth
VerifyAPIKey
BasicAuthentication
CORS: Checks if
CORS is configured.
Threat: Checks if one of the following policies is configured for all proxies
in the environment:
XMLThreatProtection or
JSONThreatProtection .
See How policies affect proxy security
scores for more information.
Target assessment: Checks if mutual transport layer security (mTLS) is configured
with the target servers in the environment.
Each of these assessment types is assigned a score of its own. The overall score is the average
of the scores of the individual assessment types.
How policies affect proxy security scores
For proxy assessments, security scores are based on the policies you are using.
How those policies are assessed depends on whether and how they are attached to flows:
Only policies that are attached to a flow (preflow,
conditional flow ,
post flow in proxies,
or shared flow) affect scores. Policies that are not attached to any flow do not
affect scores.
Proxy scores take into account shared flows a proxy calls
via flow hooks and
FlowCallout
policies in the proxy, provided the FlowCallout policy is attached to a flow.
However, if the FlowCallout is not attached to a flow, policies from its linked shared flow do
not affect security scores.
Shared flow chaining is not supported. Policies included via shared flow chaining are not
assessed when calculating security scores.
For policies attached to conditional flows, security scores only take into account
whether the policies are present; it does not take into account whether or how the policies
are enforced at runtime.
Note: If you add an environment after enabling
Advanced API Security, you will need to re-enable it, by running the command shown in
Enable Advanced
API Security again, to view security scores for the new environment.
Security profiles
A security profile is a set of security categories (described
below) that you want your APIs to be scored on.
A profile can contain any subset of the security categories.
To view security scores for an environment, you first need to attach a security profile
to the environment. You can use either Apigee's default
security profile , or you can create a custom security profile
that contains only the security categories of importance to you.
Default security profile
Advanced API Security provides a default security profile that contains all of the
security categories . If you use the default profile,
security scores will be based on all the categories.
Custom security profile
Preview — Advanced API Security Custom Profiles
This feature is covered by the Pre-GA Offerings Terms
of the Google Cloud Terms of Service. Pre-GA features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA features
may not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Support for the Preview launch of Advanced API Security Custom Profiles is available through
the
Apigee - Google Cloud Community forum.
Custom security profiles let you base your security scores on only those security
categories you want included in the score. See
Create and edit security profiles to learn how
to create a custom profile.
Security categories
Security scores are based on an assessment of the security categories described below.
Category
Description
Recommendation
Abuse
Checks for abuse , which includes any requests sent to the API for purposes other than
what it is intended for, such as high volumes of requests, data scraping,
and abuse related to authorization.
See Abuse recommendations

Limitations on security scores v1
Security scores have the following limitations:
You can create up to 100 custom profiles per organization.
Security scores are only generated if an environment has proxies, target servers, and traffic.
Newly deployed proxies do not immediately show scores.
Data delays
The data that Advanced API Security security scores are based on have the following
delays, due to the way the data is processed:
When you enable Advanced API Security in an organization,
it can take up to 6 hours for the scores for existing proxies and targets to be
reflected in an environment.
New events related to proxies (deployment and undeployment) and
targets (create, update, delete) in an environment can take up to 6 hours
to reflect in the environment's score.
Data flowing into the Apigee Analytics pipeline has a delay of up to 15 to 20 minutes on
average. As a result source scores abuse data has processing delay around 15 to 20 minutes.
Open the Risk assessment page
The Risk assessment page displays scores that measure the security of your API in each
environment.
Note: If you've previously used Risk Assessment v2 with this organization,
you'll need to select "Switch to v1" in the upper right to return to using Risk Assessment v1.
It may take a few minutes for the Risk assessment page
to load. The page will take longer to load for environments with a high volume
of traffic and a large number of proxies and targets.
To open the Risk assessment page:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Advanced API Security > Risk assessment page.
Go to Risk assessment
This displays the Risk assessment page:

it may take a few minutes for the score to be displayed.
The overall score is calculated from the individual scores
in the three assessment types :
Source assessment
Proxy assessment
Target assessment
Note that all scores are in the range 200 - 1200. Higher assessment scores indicate lower
security risk.

Abuse recommendations
If the source score is low, Apigee recommends that you review the IPs for which abuse has been
detected. Then, if you agree that the traffic from those IPs is abusive, use the
Security actions page to block requests
from IP addresses that are sources of abuse traffic.
To get more information about the abuse, you can use either of the following resources:
The Abuse detection page, which
displays information about security incidents involving abuse traffic.
The Security reports page.
For example, you can create the following reports:
IP addresses of bots, as described in
Example: bot IP Addresses report .
Bot traffic by bot_reason, as described in
Example: bot traffic by bot reason report .
