This page describes how to configure the Apigee Extension Processor to enable API policy enforcement
for API traffic using a Service Extensions-enabled load balancer.
To learn more about the suggested use cases and benefits of using the Apigee Extension Processor for
API management, see Apigee Extension Processor overview .
The Apigee Extension Processor is a traffic extension (a type of Service Extension) that lets you use Cloud Load Balancing
to send callouts from the data processing path of the application load balancer to the Apigee Extension Processor. Once the load balancer
and traffic extension are configured, API traffic is processed by the load balancer. The policies in the Apigee Extension Processor are applied to API traffic using the
traffic extension callouts.
The following sections guide you through the steps to configure the key elements of the Apigee Extension Processor:
Configure a load balancer for a backend service .
Configure the Apigee Extension Processor .
Configure the traffic extension .
Use policies with the Extension Processor .

}
Use policies with the Extension Processor
This section describes how to use policies with the Extension Processor.
In this example, configure a VerifyAPIKey
and AssignMessage policy
for the Extension Processor. These
policies validate API keys included in requests to Apigee and inject a Google
token into request headers for calls to a backend service. This scenario would be useful for API providers
using the Apigee Extension Processor to authorize and authenticate requests to their Apigee services and seamlessly
inject the Google auth tokens
required for a backend service like Vertex AI.
Add the VerifyAPIKey policy for API key validation
The following sections describe how to use the VerifyAPIKey policy to validate API keys for calls
to your backend service using the Extension Processor:
Attach the VerifyAPIKey policy to the Extension Processor.

Send a request to the load balancer using the API key
To test the API key validation, send a request to the load balancer using the API key:
curl "https:// LB_DOMAIN_NAME /get"
Where LB_DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you used for the load balancer and SSL certificate.
The response fails without an API key.
Send another request to the load balancer, using the API key in the request:
curl "https:// LB_DOMAIN_NAME /get?key= API_KEY "
Where:
LB_DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you used for the load balancer and SSL certificate.
API_KEY is the API key from the Developer App credentials revealed in an earlier step.
The response indicates successful authorization for the endpoint. This indicates that the
Extension Processor validated the API key and the Apigee proxy can now process the request.
Add the AssignMessage policy for Google authentication
If you want to use your Extension Processor to provide API management for a Google-authenticated service,
you can inject a Google access token or Google ID token into requests sent to the backend service using the
AssignMessage policy .
The following sections describe how to use the AssignMessage policy to inject a Google authentication token into requests sent to the backend service using the Extension Processor:
Attach the AssignMessage policy to the proxy.
Send a request to the load balancer to test token injection.
Attach the AssignMessage policy to the proxy
To add the AssignMessage policy to your proxy:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Proxy Development > API Proxies page.
Go to API Proxies
Select the Extension Processor proxy you created in Create an extension processor section.
Click the Develop tab.
In the navigation pane, click
add_circle in the Policies section.
In the Create policy dialog, select AssignMessage from the list of policies.
In the Assign Message pane, complete the required fields in the Name and Display name sections using the following values:
Name : Enter a policy name. For example, AM-auth .
Display name : Enter a policy name to display in the UI. For example, AM-auth .
Click Create .
Under the <Set> element, add the following child elements:
<Set>
<Authentication>
<HeaderName>Authorization</HeaderName>
<GoogleAccessToken>
<Scopes>
<Scope>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform</Scope>
</Scopes>
</GoogleAccessToken>
</Authentication>
</Set>
Click Save .
Deploy the new revision using a Google service account.
The service account
generates Google access tokens and injects them into the request header for API calls to
Google backend services.
Send a request to the load balancer to test token injection
To confirm that token injection is working, send a request to the load balancer:
curl "https:// LB_DOMAIN_NAME /get"
Where LB_DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you used for the load balancer and SSL certificate.
The response appears similar to the following:
{
...
"headers" : {
"Accept" : "*/*" ,
" Authorization" : "Bearer ya29.c.c0ASRK0Gbw03y9cfvxL11DxaRYBQUU18SmUP4Vu63OckHI5cX7wJ4DmGMG2vbDDS69HXJHqMj-lak4tcqOsJGmE65crn2gNuJLanXidwM8" ,
"First" : "1.0" ,
"Host" : "apigee-ext-proc-test.apigee.net" ,
"Second" : "1.0" ,
"Sum" : "2" ,
"User-Agent" : "curl/8.7.1" ,
"X-Api-Key" : "McYcHGR3PTSGLXExvKADwQ1JJeCjgPDUvAakCl0rJKCFaX0Y" ,
"X-Cloud-Trace-Context" : "0fd3dadc2a3c328fa968d5f5f1434c29/18300783092696918345"
} ,
...
}
The response shows the successful injection of the Google authentication token into the request header.
With the successful application of the AssignMessage policy, the client's successful request (containing the API key)
to Apigee in the example scenario is modified further to include a Google authentication token in the request header,
as required by the Google-authenticated backend service.
