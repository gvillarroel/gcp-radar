This page
applies to Apigee , but not to Apigee hybrid .
Apigee supports IAM-based authentication and authorization for API proxies. To use this feature,
include the VerifyIAM policy in the request flow of the proxy, and configure the
user identifier (usually the email address) of the API consumer to have the necessary
Google Cloud IAM role or permissions to invoke Apigee APIs. The API request should pass
a valid Google Cloud access token for that user.
Administrators may grant authorization to any
Google Cloud principal , not only to
individual users.
Use IAM-based access control
This section describes the end-to-end process for setting up IAM-based authentication and
authorization, how requests are evaluated once access is set up, and how to revoke access
for API consumers who have previously had access.
Add access management
To set up access management for an API proxy:
Add the VerifyIAM policy to the Apigee API proxy or proxies as part of the request
flow.
The Cloud admin for the Apigee project:
Grants
the deploymentInvoker IAM role (or a custom role
with the apigee.deployments.invoke IAM permission) to the API consumer's
Google Cloud principal at the project level. This gives the API consumer access to invoke
all the hosted APIs in the associated Apigee organization.
or
Uses the SetIamPolicy action to grant the role or permission to the API consumer's
Google Cloud principle at a particular deployment or iteratively at multiple deployments.
Use the
list operation
on the deployment resource to see all of the deployments within an environment, including both
API proxies and shared flows. The name of the deployment is the name of the API
proxy or the shared flow.
Note: Adding the role or permission on
shared flow deployments does not create a VerifyIAM policy check on the shared flows; apply the
permissions to proxies only. For proxies calling shared flows, the permissions should be
applied to the proxies. With proxy chaining, grant the permission on the proxy with
the policy; the permission is not required on other proxies part of the chain.
Direct the API consumer to
generate an access token ,
which they will pass inside the Apigee API request for the permission check. The generated
token must have the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform auth scope.
Admin Operations
This section lists actions API admins (API producers) take when managing IAM-based permissions.
Documentation for API-based operations used when managing IAM-based access are found in the
organizations.environments
and
organizations.environments.deployments
API reference documentation, and include the SetIamPolicy ,
GetIamPolicy , TestIamPermissions , and
GetDeployment operations.
This table maps operations to required permissions:
Admin operation
Action
IAM Permission needed
IAM Resource on which the permission is needed *
GetDeployment
Retrieve information for a deployment in an Apigee environment
apigee.deployments.get
Google Cloud project or Apigee environment
ListDeployments
List the deployments in an Apigee environment
apigee.deployments.list
Project or Apigee Environment
SetIamPolicy
Set invoke access for API consumer(s) at a particular API deployment
apigee.deployments.setIamPolicy
Google Cloud project or Apigee environment
GetIamPolicy
Fetch the set of invoke access settings for an API deployment
apigee.deployments.getIamPolicy
Google Cloud project or Apigee environment
TestIamPermissions
Check whether the user calling this API has the permission mentioned in the payload
No IAM permission needed
N/A
* The Google Cloud project is the project used to provision Apigee. Apigee
environment-level permissions are set on the environment using
setIAMPolicy .
Runtime access check
When the API consumer attempts to access an API with IAM-based access control, a check is
performed to see if they have the necessary access token and appropriate role or permission
at either the project or deployment level. If so, they are allowed to continue with access to
the proxy. Otherwise, they are blocked.
Remove access
To remove access at the project level: To remove access for an API consumer that's
managed at the project level, the Cloud admin for the Apigee project
revokes
the deploymentInvoker IAM role (or the custom role
with the apigee.deployments.invoke IAM permission) from the API consumer's
Google Cloud principal for the Google Cloud project.
If access was granted for individual deployments using setIamPolicy ,
remove the role or permission from the deployment(s) using another setIamPolicy operation.
Characteristics and limitations of IAM-based access control
Note these characteristics and limitations when using IAM-based authentication and authorization:
Typically, policy execution with VerifyIAM takes between 10 and 50 milliseconds. However,
some calls might experience higher latencies. For example, in the
asia-east2 region specifically, average latency can rise to 50 ms, and some
calls could take around 100 ms to complete.
Please note that these latency figures are not guaranteed.
Inclusion of the VerifyIAM policy for a proxy is a verified/not verified check only; the API
consumer's specific roles and permissions are not considered in later processes in the
request or response flow.
Since an authorization check is performed only at the time of VerifyIAM policy execution,
VerifyIAM should be the first policy in the request flow, after only traffic management
policies.
If the permission validation succeeds or the API producer has marked the VerifyIAM policy to
continue on error, the request flow continues to execute the other policies, if
any, ultimately reaching the target server. If the permission check fails and the API
producer has not marked the policy to continue on error, the user receives an error.
Adding invoke access ( apigee.deployments.invoke ) at the environment level does
not convey the invoke access on all API deployments within the environment.
IAM conditions are not supported on the deployment resource, and can't be used to control
invoke access. See
Adding Apigee IAM Conditions to policies
for more information.
IAM-based access control supports a maximum of 1,500 role bindings within a single policy
and other limitations. See
IAM quotas and limits .
IAM-based access control is subject to
IAM propagation delays .
Attempting to manage other apigee.deployments operations, such as
apigee.deployments.delete via the deployment-level setIAMPolicy, will not be
effective but also will not return an error. Only apigee.deployements.invoke is
effective.
Access on a deployment is deleted when the corresponding proxy is
undeployed from the environment or deleted; access needs to be re-added on
redeployment.
IAM-based authentication and authorization is not available in hybrid at this time.
Examples
This section provides examples for granting and revoking IAM-based access to APIs. These
examples all assume that VerifyIAM has already been added to the appropriate API proxy.
In these examples, use either the Cloud console or gcloud (shown) to
manage roles
or permissions on the API consumer's Google Cloud principal.
Grant and revoke user access to invoke all APIs in an Apigee organization
To add access, add the deploymentInvoker role:
APIGEE_ORG= GCP_PROJECT
USER= USER_EMAIL_HERE
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${APIGEE_ORG}" --member="${USER}" \
--role='roles/apigee.deploymentInvoker'
To revoke access, remove the deploymentInvoker role:
APIGEE_ORG= GCP_PROJECT
USER= USER_EMAIL_HERE
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding "${APIGEE_ORG}" --member="${USER}" \
--role='roles/apigee.deploymentInvoker'
Grant and revoke user access to specific deployments within an environment
To add the invoker role for a single user to a specific deployment:
APIGEE_ORG= GCP_PROJECT
ENV= APIGEE_ENVIRONMENT
API= APIPROXY_NAME
USER= USER_EMAIL_HERE
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/${APIGEE_ORG}/environments/${ENV}/deployments/${API}:setIamPolicy" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"policy": {
"bindings": [
{
"members": [
"user:'" $USER "'"
],
"role": "roles/apigee.deploymentInvoker"
}
]
}
}'
A success response should look something like:
{
"version" : 1 ,
"etag" : "BwYT8i40Vwo=" ,
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : "roles/apigee.deploymentInvoker" ,
"members" : [
"user:user-email@example.com"
]
}
]
}
To add the invoker role for multiple users to a specific deployment:
APIGEE_ORG= GCP_PROJECT
ENV= APIGEE_ENVIRONMENT
API= APIPROXY_NAME
USER1= EMAIL_FOR_USER1
USER2= EMAIL_FOR_USER2
USER3= EMAIL_FOR_USER3
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/${APIGEE_ORG}/environments/${ENV}/deployments/${API}:setIamPolicy" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"policy": {
"bindings": [
{
"members": [
"user:'" $USER1 "'",
"user:'" $USER2 "'",
"user:'" $USER3 "'"
],
"role": "roles/apigee.deploymentInvoker"
}
]
}
}'
To query the policy object that has been previously set:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/${APIGEE_ORG}/environments/${ENV}/deployments/${API}:getIamPolicy" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
You should see a success response like the one shown above.
The user may verify whether they are able to access the specified deployment (whether the
apigee.deployments.invoke permission is set for the user in a specified
deployment), without invoking the deployed API directly. To do that, the user can
submit this request using an access token they generate:
APIGEE_ORG= GCP_PROJECT
ENV= APIGEE_ENVIRONMENT
API= APIPROXY_NAME
USER= USER_EMAIL_HERE
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/${APIGEE_ORG}/environments/${ENV}/deployments/${API}:testIamPermissions" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"permissions":["apigee.deployments.invoke"]}'
The response should include the apigee.deployments.invoke permission for the user.
To revoke access on a specific deployment for a single user, remove the
deploymentInvoker role for that user. To do so, first get the policy object that
is currently associated with the deployment:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/${APIGEE_ORG}/environments/${ENV}/deployments/${API}:getIamPolicy" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
The success response should look something like the following.
{
"version" : 1 ,
"etag" : "BwYT8i40Vwo=" ,
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : "roles/apigee.deploymentInvoker" ,
"members" : [
"user:user1-email@example.com" ,
"user:user2-email@example.com" ,
"user:user3-email@example.com"
]
}
]
}
To remove the binding for a single user, use setIamPolicy and specify in the
payload the users who should continue to have access, as you would when setting initial access
for those users. Continuing with the example shown above, if you wanted to remove access for
USER1, but retain access for USER2 and USER3, you would use this command:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/${APIGEE_ORG}/environments/${ENV}/deployments/${API}:setIamPolicy" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"policy": {
"bindings": [
{
"members": [
"user:'" $USER2 "'",
"user:'" $USER3 "'"
],
"role": "roles/apigee.deploymentInvoker"
}
]
}
}'
To remove the binding for all users on a specific deployment, specify an empty payload:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/${APIGEE_ORG}/environments/${ENV}/deployments/${API}:setIamPolicy" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{}'
To verify that the binding was removed, make sure that the
apigee.deployments.invoke permission does not exist for the user on the deployment:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/${APIGEE_ORG}/environments/${ENV}/deployments/${API}:testIamPermissions" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"permissions":["apigee.deployments.invoke"]}'
This should return an appropriate response; for example, an empty output if no users have
the permission to invoke the API.
