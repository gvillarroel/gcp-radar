Preview — Advanced API Security Actions
This feature is covered by the Pre-GA Offerings Terms
of the Google Cloud Terms of Service. Pre-GA features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA features
may not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Support for the Preview launch of Advanced API Security Actions is available through
the
Apigee - Google Cloud Community forum.
Advanced API Security security actions let you configure security actions defining how Apigee handles
traffic . For example, you can
create a security
action to deny requests from an IP address that has been identified by Abuse Detection as abuse
and block them from accessing your APIs.
To use this feature,
you must enable the add-on. If you are a Subscription customer, you can enable the
add-on for your organization. See
Manage Advanced API Security for Subscription organizations for more details. If
you are a Pay-as-you-go customer, you can enable the add-on in your eligible environments. For more information, see
Manage the Advanced API Security add-on .
This page provides an overview of the security action functionality and how to use it from the
Apigee UI in Cloud console . You can also manage security actions using the
Security actions API or through Terraform .
Also, see
Required roles for security actions for the roles needed to perform security actions tasks.
Note: Security actions is available for Apigee and
Apigee hybrid versions 1.11 and later.
How security actions work
With security actions, you can explicitly allow,
deny, or flag requests based on specific conditions. Apigee applies these actions to requests before your
API proxies process them. Typically, you take action either because requests conform to patterns
of unwanted behavior, or (in the case of the allow action) because you want to override a deny action
for specific traffic.
The flag action allows requests to pass to your APIs, but adds up to five headers to
flagged requests, so you can track them to observe their behavior.
Note: Blocked and flagged requests count toward your API call volume.
One way to identify which requests to take action on is to use the Abuse detection
Detected
traffic or Incident
views, which show IP addresses and API keys that are sources of abuse.
Security actions
You can take the following types of security actions.
Action type
Description
Precedence order
Allow
Allows certain requests that would otherwise be blocked by a deny action.
For example, suppose you have created a security action to deny traffic that has been tagged with
a detection rule. You could create an allow action to override the deny action for requests
with some specific conditions.
1
Deny
Blocks all requests that meet the conditions of the action, for example, originating
at a specified IP address. When you choose to deny requests,
Apigee responds to the client with a response code that you can choose.
2
Flag
Flag requests that meet the specified condition so that your backend services
can take action on them.
When you flag a client's requests, Apigee adds up to five headers, which you define, to the
request. Your backend services can process the API calls according to these flags, for
example, by redirecting the calls to a different flow. The flag action provides a way
to signal your backend services that an API call is suspicious.
3
Precedence order
When a request meets the condition of more than one security action, the precedence
order of the actions determines which action is performed. For example, suppose a request meets
the conditions of both an allow and a deny action. Since the precedence order of
an allow action is 1 and the precedence order of a deny action is 2, the allow action takes
precedence, so the request is allowed access to the API.
As an example, you might want to allow requests from the IP address of an internal or trusted
client, even if those requests matched a separate deny action. The precedence order ensures that
an allow action for the trusted IP address would override any deny action.
Note: If you are using both security actions and the
AccessControl policy
to manage traffic based on IP address, the security action always executes before the
AccessControl policy. After that, neither impacts the other; the security action has no
influence on the AccessControl policy and vice versa.
Proxy-specific security actions
A security action can apply to all proxies in an environment or only to a specific proxy or
proxies within the environment. See
Limitations on security actions for limitations on proxy-specific security actions.
Security action statuses
Each security action has a status:
Enabled : The security action is active and affects API requests so long as it is not
also expired.
Disabled : The security action is inactive and does not affect API requests.
Paused : The security action is inactive and does not affect API requests.
Limitations on security actions
Security actions are enforced at the Apigee environment level. For each environment,
security actions have the following limitations:
At most 1,000 enabled actions for an environment are allowed at any time. Enabled actions that
are also expired count toward this limit.
You can add at most 5 flag headers for each action.
Proxy-specific security actions support a maximum of 100 proxies.
Proxy-specific security actions are not supported in Apigee hybrid at this time.
Multiple security actions with the same name are not supported. It might be possible to create
multiple actions with the same name by creating multiple actions in rapid successsion. In that
case, only the most recent action with that name is effective.
Latencies
Security actions have the following latencies:
When you create, edit, or delete a security action, it can take up to 10 minutes
for the change to take effect. Once a new action has taken effect and has
been applied to some API traffic, you will be able to view the action's effects in
the
Security action details page. Note:
It's not possible to determine whether an action has taken effect from the
Security action details page unless the action has been applied to some API traffic.
Enabled security actions incur a small increase (less than 2 percent) in API proxy response time.
Manage security actions in the UI
This section describes how to use the Security actions page in the
Apigee UI in Cloud console . You can also manage security actions using the
Security actions API .
Open the Security actions page
To open the Security actions page:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Advanced API security > Security actions page.
Go to Security actions
This opens the main Security actions page:
Note: The image above shows security actions that have
already been created. If you have not yet created any security actions, no rows will be
displayed in the table.
In the Security actions page you can:
Create a new security action .
Edit an existing security action .
Enable or disable security
actions .
Pause all or some enabled security
actions .
Delete security actions .
The Security actions page displays a list of security actions, with the
following details:
Name : The name of the security action. Click the name to view the action's details.
Status : The status of the action. See
Security action statuses .
Action : The security action type.
Expiration (UTC) : The expiration date of the action.
Last updated (UTC) : The last date and time the action was updated.
A three-dot menu where you can edit, disable, enable, or delete the action.
Create or edit a security action
This section explains how to create or edit a security action.
Note that you can't change the security action name or environment
once you've created it.
Note: Security actions for environments created before April 2024
are paused by default, so you might need to resume them. See
Enable, disable, pause, or delete security actions for information.
To create or edit a security action:
Open the Security actions page .
To create a new security action, click Create at the top of the page. To edit an existing
security action, either click Edit in the three-dot menu for that action in the
actions list or select the action and select Edit at the top of the page.
Under General settings , enter or edit the following settings:
Name: A name for the security action.
Description (optional): A brief description of the action.
Environment: The environment in which you want to create the security action.
Proxies (optional): The proxies that you want the security action to apply to.
Limit the proxy list by name using the Filter field.
Leave the Proxies field empty to apply the security action to all current and
future proxies in the environment.
Select individual proxies to apply the security action to only those proxies
regardless of any new proxies added to the environment later.
Use Select all to select all current proxies in the environment. Any
proxies added later will not be automatically included in the rule.
Expiration: The date and time when the action expires, if any. Select either
Never , or
Custom , and then enter the date and time when you want the action to expire. You can
also modify the time zone.
Click Next to display the Rule section. In this section, enter or edit:
Action type: The type of security action :
Allow: The request is allowed.
Deny: The request is denied. If you select Deny , you can also specify
the response code that is returned when a request is denied. This can be either:
Predefined: Select an HTTP code.
Custom: Enter a response code.
Flag: The request is allowed, but also flagged with a special HTTP header
that a proxy looks for to determine whether the request requires special handling. To
define the header, under Headers If
you select Flag , you can also create the following under Headers :
Header name
Header value
Conditions: The conditions under which the security action is carried out.
Under New condition , enter the following:
Condition type: Can be either Detection rules or one of the following
attributes:
IP addresses/CIDR ranges , which can include IP addresses and IPv4 CIDR
ranges at the same time.
API keys , one or more API keys.
API products , one or more Apigee API products.
Access tokens , one or more access tokens.
Developers , one or more Apigee developer email addresses.
Developer apps , one or more Apigee developer apps.
User agents , one or more user agents.
HTTP methods ,
HTTP methods
such as GET or PUT.
Region codes , a list of region codes to act on. See
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes .
Autonomous system numbers (ASN), a list of ASN numbers to act on,
such as "23". See
Autonomous system (Internet) .
Notes:
For the condition types Detection rules
and IP addresses/CIDR ranges , you can create at most two conditions that have
those types.
For any other condition type, you can create at most one condition.
To use the API keys , API products , access tokens ,
developers , or developer apps conditions, you need to also use
either the
Verify API Key policy or the
OAuthV2 policy. See
How API keys work for more information.
For Apigee hybrid, these conditions are available in version 1.12 and later:
API keys, API products, access tokens, developers, developer apps, and user
agents. These conditions are available in version 1.13 and later: autonomous
system numbers, CIDR ranges, HTTP methods, and region codes.
Values: Enter one of the following:
If Condition type is Detection rules ,
select a set of
detection rules
that a request must have triggered for the security action to be applied to it.
If Condition type is an attribute, enter the values
of the attribute that you want the security action to be applied to.
For example, if the attribute is
IP addresses/CIDR ranges , enter the IP addresses of the
sources of the requests you want the security action to be applied to. You can enter
a comma-separated list of either IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
Click Create to create the security action.
Enable, disable, pause, or delete security actions
This section describes how to change the status of a security action from the
Security actions page. See Security action statuses
for information on each status type and how it affects actions on API requests.
These are the actions you can take to change statuses:
To disable an active security action, either click the three-dot menu in the row for the
action and select Disable or click the security action name and click Disable
at the top of the page.
To enable a security action, either click the three-dot menu in the row for the
action and select Enable or click the security action name and click Enable
at the top of the page.
To pause all active security actions to temporarily inactivate them,
click Pause Enabled Actions at the top of the page security actions list. To
resume all paused actions, click Resume Paused Actions at the top of the
page. Note: When you resume all enabled actions, any disabled actions
remain disabled.
You can also delete a security action. Deleting it permanently removes it from your
configuration. To delete a security action, click the three-dot menu in the row for the
action and select Delete or click the security action name and click Delete
at the top of the page.
View security action details
To view recent API traffic data related to a security action, click the security action name
in the main Security actions page. This displays the Security action details page, which has
two tabs, Overview and Attributes .
Overview
Select the Overview tab to display the Overview page:
The Overview page displays information about recent API traffic
during the time period you select at the top of the page: 12 hours, 1 day, 1 week, or 2 weeks.
The page displays the following traffic data:
Action type : Deny, allow, or flag. See Security actions
for information on the action types.
Total environment traffic: The total number of requests in the environment.
Total detected event traffic: The number of requests which were "detected" (triggered
an abuse rule) in the environment.
Total traffic affected by the action:
For a deny action, the number of denied requests.
For a flag action, the number of flagged requests.
For an allow action, the number of allowed requests.
The page also displays the following graphs:
Environment traffic trends : Graphs of detected traffic, flagged traffic, and
total environment traffic. This graph is restricted to
a recent time interval that contains all
observed traffic. This interval might be shorter than the interval you select.

Action details
Attributes
Select the Attributes tab to display the Attributes page.
The Attributes page displays data for the security action by
attributes —also known as
dimensions —
which are groupings of the data that let you view the
security action in different ways. For example, the API products attribute lets you view the
security action by API product.
The information displayed in the Attributes page is similar the Attributes view
for the Abuse detection
Incident details attributes .
