Preview — Advanced API Security Abuse Detection
This feature is covered by the Pre-GA Offerings Terms
of the Google Cloud Terms of Service. Pre-GA features may have limited support, and changes to pre-GA features
may not be compatible with other pre-GA versions. For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Support for the Preview launch of Advanced API Security Abuse Detection is available through
the
Apigee - Google Cloud Community forum.
Advanced API Security's abuse detection lets you view security
incidents involving your APIs. A security incident is a group of events with similar
patterns that could represent a security threat. Advanced API Security uses
machine learning models to detect patterns that are a sign of malicious activity, including API
scraping and anomalies, and cluster events together based on similar patterns.
When Advanced API Security detects a security incident, it reports the following:
The risk level and duration of the incident
The proxies affected by the incident
The IP addresses of the incident events
The detection rules that
were triggered by the incident
The countries of origin of the incident
and other related information about the incident.
You can access abuse detection either through the Apigee UI, as described below, or through the
Incidents API or the
Security stats API
See
Required roles and permissions for abuse detection for the roles and permissions needed to use
abuse detection.
To use this feature,
you must enable the add-on. If you are a Subscription customer, you can enable the
add-on for your organization. See
Manage Advanced API Security for Subscription organizations for more details. If
you are a Pay-as-you-go customer, you can enable the add-on in your eligible environments. For more information, see
Manage the Advanced API Security add-on .
Opt in for machine learning models for Abuse Detection
Apigee requests your help in improving the machine learning models for abuse
detection in your organization, by allowing us to train the models on your data. Training the models
on your data helps improve their accuracy for detecting security incidents.
The training will only apply to your organization. Your data will not be shared with
any other Google Cloud customers for training purposes.
When you first open the Abuse detection page in the Apigee UI, you will see an opt-in
request to allow Advanced API Security's machine learning models to use your API traffic data for
model training. You must explicitly opt in to use the model for abuse detection. Note that if
you do not choose to opt in to model training, you will not see any detections from the
Advanced Anomaly Detection rule. This rule does not work without opting in for model training.
See
Required roles and permissions for abuse detection
for information on roles needed to manage whether machine learning is enabled.
Use a machine learning model for Abuse Detection Advanced Anomaly Detection
In order to see detected anomalies in Abuse Detection, you must opt in to allow the Advanced
Anomaly Detection machine learning model to train on your API traffic data.
The model only uses your data for training. Your data is never shared with any other
Google Cloud customers.
To opt in to use your API traffic data for anomaly detection model training, select that option
when adding anomaly detection to your Abuse Detection configuration.
Open the Abuse detection page
To open the Abuse detection page:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Advanced API Security > Abuse detection page.
Go to Abuse detection
This displays the main Abuse detection page:
Note: When you first open the Abuse detection page, you will see a
banner that requests permission to train your organization's security models
on your data. If you agree, click
Enable improvement of my Apigee organization's Advanced API Security models below the
banner.
Change permissions for allowing Apigee to improve your machine learning models
You can
change your permissions for allowing Apigee to improve your machine learning models at any time,
by clicking Settings
at the top right of the Abuse detection page and selecting the option to either
enable or disable this feature.
Main Abuse detection page
At the top of the page, you can select one of the following recent time periods
in which to view incidents: the past 1 day , 1 week , or 2 weeks .
The table in the page displays the environments in your organization that are affected by
security incidents during the selected time interval.
Note: If no environments are displayed, it means that no incidents have
been detected in any environment in the selected time interval. In this case, you can
try selecting a longer time interval, which can be up to 14 days in the past.
Each row of the table also displays the following:
Environment : The environment in which the abuse occurred.
Total incidents : The total number of incidents in the environment
during the selected time interval. See Limitations on
incidents and data displayed for more information on what incidents and data are
displayed in the UI.
Risk level : Shows the number of incidents at three risk levels: severe, moderate, and
low. Risk level is based on different characteristics of an incident, such as the
number of rules detected, their types, and the relative size of the incident compared to
legitimate traffic. The risk level is intended to help you prioritize which incidents to
investigate, so you can focus on the most critical ones.
Risk level can be one of the following:
Severe: Severe incidents present high risk. We recommend that you prioritize
investigating them.
Moderate : Moderate incidents present some risk, but less than those
with severe risk,
and we recommend that you prioritize them over low risk incidents.
Low : Low risk incidents can be investigated last, after you have investigated
the higher risk incidents.
The number next to each risk level indicates the number of incidents at that risk level.
Environment details
To view the incidents
in an environment for the selected time range, select the environment in the table shown above.
This opens the Environment details view:
If you see an incident or detected traffic, and want to create a
security action to block or flag requests related to the incident or detected
traffic, click
Create Security Action at the top of the page. This opens the
Security actions page.
Limitations on incidents and data displayed:
The Abuse detection UI does not display incidents whose Last event detected
is over 14 days in the past.
The UI only displays incident data received after 14 days in the past.
To get additional information about these incidents, you can do either of the
following:
Call the Incidents API
to get a list of incidents outside the 14-day range.
Call the
Security reports API
to gather more details about those incidents.
The Environment details view has two tabs:
Incidents : Shows a list of incidents
in the environment and information about them.
Detected traffic : Shows details of detected abuse
traffic related to the incidents.
Incidents
The Incidents tab of the Environment details view, shown above, displays the
following options:
Environment : Change the environment in which to view incidents.
Proxy : You can use Select all to display incidents for all proxies, or
select one or more individual proxies to display incidents only for selected proxies.
Include archived incidents : When this is selected, the incidents list
displays archived incidents . Archived incidents
are displayed with an icon next to them:
To hide archived incidents from the list, deselect Include archived incidents .
You might want to hide archived incidents
if there are many incidents displayed and you don't want to view them all, or if you
want to hide incidents that you have already investigated.
The Incidents view also displays the following:
Incident name : A generated name summarizing the incident. You may see
"Miscellaneous" for some low risk incident names. These include traffic that did not fit into
groupings representing well-defined, higher risk threat patterns.
Risk level : The risk level of the incident. In general, focus on High risk
incidents first, which also have higher confidence than Low risk incidents.
Top detection rules : A list of the top
detection rules
that were triggered by the incident.
Incident traffic : The total number of events : API calls that were tagged
by one of the detection rules related to the incident.
First event detected : The date and time the first event in the
incident was detected.
Last event detected : The date and time the last event in the
incident was detected.
Duration : The duration of the incident, from its first event
to its last.
UUID : The universally unique identifier of the incident.
Incident details
To view the details of an incident, click its name in the table. This
displays the Overview pane of the Incident details view:
You can click Create Security Action
at the top of the page to create a
security action in response to the incident.
The Incident details view has two tabs, Overview and Attributes .
See Overview for information on the overview tab and see
Attributes for information on attributes.
Overview
The Overview pane displays basic information about the incident,
including the following:
Incident name : The name of the incident.
Risk level : The risk level of the incident.
Impacted proxies : The number of proxies affected by the incident. Click View
proxies to view the affected proxies.
Duration : The duration of the incident, from its first event
to its last. It also shows the date and time when the event was first detected.
IP addresses (count): The number of unique IP addresses detected for this incident. Click
View IP addresses to see more information on the IP addresses.
Insights : Abuse detection incident details might include generative AI insights created using
Google Cloud generative AI large language
models (LLMs) .
The LLM summarizes the detected traffic per incident to help you better understand the
security incident, provides additional context and information on the
incident, links to supporting documentation, and recommends next steps. Provide your feedback
by clicking the thumbs up or thumbs down icon and providing an optional explanation.
Insight summaries and recommendations are based on the last 14 days of data, even if the
incident started longer than 14 days ago.
Caution: Use Insights with caution. Insights might not be
accurate or complete.
These generative AI insights are included automatically in abuse detection if the project and
your user account are set up to use the Cloud AI Companion API. See
Enable the Cloud AI Companion API in a Google Cloud project
and Grant IAM roles in a Google Cloud project .
User accounts also need an additional permission to view insights. See
Required roles and permissions for abuse detection .
To disable
the generative AI insights, disable Cloud AI Companion API for this project following
the instructions in
Disabling services .
Events : Displays a time series graph of events in the incident. For each time point
in the graph, the corresponding y value is the total number of events in a short time period
around that time. If you hover the cursor over
a point in the graph, the number of events in the most recent time period is
displayed below Value . You can see the values where the time periods change by
moving the cursor to the left or right and observing where the values change.
The Events pane also displays the total environment and incident traffic counts.
Top rules detected : Displays up to five of the top groups of rules detected,
including the following information:
Dominant rules : The most significant detection rules that were triggered by
the incident.
Dominant rules API events : The number of API events tagged
by the dominant rules.
Total rules detected : The number of detection rules
that were triggered by the incident.
To view all rules, click View All Rules at the bottom of the card.
Top countries detected : A map showing the countries that
were sources of events in the incident. Below the map is a chart that shows up to five of
these countries and the percentage of the total traffic originating in these countries.
Note: If the country of origin of the events can't be determined, the map displays
not set .
To view all countries, click View All Countries at the bottom of the card.
IP addresses : View incident details by source IP addresses for events in the
incident. Select Display all IP addresses to see all IP addresses in the list.
Note: The IP addresses pane displays unique IP addresses,
even if more than one incident corresponds to the same IP address.

is not visible. Once the API key is shown, click it to see the
Details view .
App : The developer application or
AppGroup
application associated with the API key.
Detected traffic : Total number of requests from the API key.
% of calls : Percentage of requests from the API key out of all calls in the
environment.
First event detected : The first time an event with a request with this API key
was detected in the incident.
Last event detected : The last time an event with a request with this API key was
detected in the incident.
Mitigate large numbers of false positives
If you're seeing a large number of false positives and internal IP addresses flagged as
anomalies by Advanced API Security's Abuse Detection rules, follow the guidance
in this section to mitigate the problem.
By default, Apigee uses the first public IP address listed in the X-Forwarded-For
(XFF) header in the API requests. However, for organizations with significant internal API
traffic, the XFF header might include
private IPs that are listed before public IPs (for example, when using a public load balancer IP
address). In this case, Apigee's default behavior is to ignore the private
IPs in the XFF header, and display the public load balancer IP address as the traffic source.
This could result in Apigee attributing an artificially large amount of traffic to that public IP
address, which could then be flagged as an anomalous traffic pattern in Advanced API Security's
Abuse Detection feature.
You can mitigate this problem by configuring
client IP address resolution for the environment to indicate which IP address
Apigee should use as the source IP. Using client IP resolution guides Apigee
to report the true source IP address for your API traffic. For example, you
could tell Apigee to always use the first IP address in your XFF header,
even if that is a private IP address.
Archive incidents
To help you distinguish between the incidents you have already investigated from those that
you haven't, you can archive the incidents that no longer require your attention.
Archiving an incident hides it from the Environment details > Incidents
list (provided that
Include archived incidents is not selected). Archiving does not delete an incident:
you can always unarchive it if you change your mind.
To archive an incident, select Archive at the top of the
Incident details view.
After you do so, the Archive button label changes to
Unarchive .
Unarchive incidents
To unarchive an archived incident:
In the Environment details > Incidents view, click the icon next to
the incident you want to unarchive:
At the top of the incident list, click Unarchive .
Alternatively, if you are in the Incident details view for the incident,
click Unarchive .
Detected traffic
Detected traffic is traffic that triggered an abuse detection rule. The
Detected Traffic view displays information about incidents, which are specific instances
of detected traffic. The page shows incidents with Last event detected within
the past 14 days. See Limitations on incidents and data displayed
for more information on the time range of the data
displayed in the UI.
To open the Detected Traffic view, select Detected Traffic in the
Environment details view:
The Detected Traffic view displays data for:
Total traffic : The total number of requests.
Detected traffic : The number of requests from IP addresses of detected abuse.
% of detected traffic : The percentage that detected traffic makes up out of
total traffic.
Detected IP address count : The number of distinct IP addresses corresponding to
the detected abuse. Multiple requests from the same IP address are only counted once.
The Detected Traffic view also displays a table listing the details of
each IP address corresponding to the detected abuse. Note that by default,
the IP addresses are not displayed for privacy reasons. To
view them, select Display all IP addresses at the top of the table.
Each row of the IP address table displays:
IP address : IP address of the detected abuse. Click View to see the address.
Once the IP address is shown, click it to see the Details view .
Location : The location of the IP address.
Top app key : The app key used most frequently in requests from the IP address. Note:
app key is another term for API key .
Detection rules : A list of all
detection
rules that were triggered by the abuse.
Top URL : The URL that received the most requests from the IP address.
Detected traffic : The number of requests from the IP address.
% of detected traffic : The percentage of requests from the IP address out of all requests
in the environment.
First event detected : The first time an event was detected in a request from the IP
address during the time range selected at the top of the Security Scores page.
Last event detected : The last time an event was detected in a request from the IP address
during the time range selected at the top of the Security Scores page.
Details view
The Details view provides information about the incident or detected traffic. It shows
detected rules, first and last detection dates, and
attributes for detected traffic from the IP address of API key.
(See the
Analytics dimensions reference and the
Security stats API dimensions for more information on the detail fields.)
For IP addresses, the Details tab also includes information about related Ingress
access logs . See
Ingress access logs in Abuse Detection for
information.
If detected rules for the incident or traffic involve anomaly detection rules, the Advanced
Anomaly Detection reasons section shows information about the detected
anomalous traffic.
Raw data tab
After clicking the IP address or API key, you can select the Raw data tab to see raw data
for the detected traffic, including timestamps, request paths, and response status codes. Raw
data shown is limited to 1,000 rows and is a sample, not necessarily the most recent data.
Abuse Detail tab
If the incident or detected traffic includes detected anomalies, the Abuse Detail tab
shows information about the detected anomalous events, including time series graphs of traffic
from the IP address with anomalous events indicated.
The time series charts show activity at and near anomalous indicators. For
example, if an error rate spikes, the y-axis of the time series shows the error rate
before, at, and after the spike. If traffic volume spikes, the y-axis of the time series shows volume
data before, at, and after that event.
The model might not always flag and show all anomalous data in the time series charts.
The model selects the activity it determines has the biggest influence on environment-level
error rates.
Links under the charts connect directly to the
Google Cloud logging related to the event. See
Ingress access logs in Abuse Detection for
information.
Attributes
The Attributes view lets you drill down on the details of an incident or detected
traffic. Attributes —also known as
dimensions —
are groupings of the data that let you view the
incident in different ways. For example, the API products attribute lets you view the
data by API product.
To view the Attributes for an incident, select the Attributes tab
at the top of the Incident details view.
To view the Attributes for a specific
API address or API key in an incident or detected
traffic, click the IP address or API key in the results table on that overview page.
The left pane displays all of the attributes and the number of distinct values for each
attribute. You can select an attribute to view its incident details.
The picture above shows the Attributes view with Countries/Regions selected.
The Countries/Regions pane displays graphs of the percentage of API calls
made for each region.
See
What does it mean
when an attribute has the value (not set) if you see (not set)
for any values.
The Filter field lets you filter the data displayed in the pane for an attribute
by various properties.
In general, the pane for an attribute displays a table that shows incident data
by the values of the attribute. The columns of the table include:
Total calls made : Total number of API calls.
% of calls : Percentage of all calls for each value of the attribute.
Last detection time : The last time an event related to the incident was detected.
For some attributes, the table has additional columns.
See dimensions
for information on each attribute, including:
API products :
View details by API product .
Countries/Regions : View details by the countries and regions where the events in
the incident originated.
AppGroup apps : View details by related
AppGroup
app. If no AppGroup is associated with the request, the AppGroup app and
AppGroup name columns show (not set) . See the Developer apps
information instead.
AppGroups : View details by related
AppGroups
by name. If no AppGroup is associated with the request, the AppGroup name and
AppGroup app columns show (not set) . See the Developers
information instead.
Developers : View details by
developers —the
people who develop the apps. Developers includes a column labeled
Apps , which lists the applications for each developer. If the app is owned by an
AppGroup ,
the Developer column shows (not set) and the Apps column
shows the AppGroup apps. See the AppGroups names tab for more information.
Developer apps : View details by
application .
The Developer Email column lists the emails for each app's developers. If the app is owned by an
AppGroup ,
the Developer column shows (not set) and the Apps column
shows the AppGroup apps. See the AppGroups apps tab for more information.
Proxies : View details by
proxy .
Response codes : View details by response code.
Rules : View details by detection rules.
User agents : View details by user agent—the software agent that made
the API call.
What does it mean when an attribute has the value (not set) ?
Occasionally, an attribute has the value (not set) . There are several reasons why
this might occur. For one, Apigee might not have enough information to determine the attribute's
value—for example, the country of origin of an API call. Or, the attribute might not
apply in a particular case. See
What does an analytics entity value "(not set)" mean? for more information.
Ingress access logs in abuse detection
If you have enabled Cloud Logging for Apigee ingress access logs, the details page for an
IP address or API key provides a link
directly to Cloud Logging with a filter set for the currently selected IP address.
See
View logs by using the Logs Explorer for usage information. Suggested filters:
To see all anomaly types, view all calls.
To find errors only, restrict the results to the Error severity.
If you don't have Cloud Logging enabled for Apigee ingress access logs, this field
provides a link for more information on Cloud Logging. See
Logging Apigee access logs
for information on and important pricing implications when using Cloud Logging ingress
access logs for Apigee instances.
Note: Viewing Cloud Logging for Apigee ingress access logs
is not available with Apigee hybrid at this time.
Exclude traffic from abuse detection
In some cases you might want to exclude traffic from abuse detection. For example, if you have
a set of IP addresses that you know are used for automated testing or probing, you might not
want to flag excessive traffic from those sources as abuse.
Exclude traffic from abuse detection by adding attributes to
exclusion lists , which specify the traffic to exclude and the
reasons why. At this time Apigee supports CIDR ranges and IP addresses as attributes you can use
to exclude traffic.
Exclusion lists
Exclusion lists collect the attributes to exclude from detection. You can create multiple
exclusion lists for each environment, and each list can include multiple CIDR ranges and IP
addresses.
When managing exclusion lists , you can add or modify
attributes directly. For example, you don't need to wait for an IP address to appear in an
abuse detection incident to exclude it from detection.
It can take up to three days for traffic that's added to an exclusion list to be excluded from
new incidents. Once the traffic is excluded, it does not appear in any new
detections or incidents, but does continue to appear in previous reports, marked in the
Exclusions column for incidents and detected traffic in the UI.
Exclusion list fields
Exclusion lists include these fields. All fields are required unless marked optional.
Field
Description
Display name
The display name for the list. This name is shown in the
Exclusions tab.
IP addresses and CIDR ranges
The IP addresses or CIDR ranges to exclude from detection. You must include at least one
CIDR range or IP address, and can exclude a maximum of 30 total CIDR ranges and IP addresses
per list.
Prefer CIDR ranges over IP addresses where possible.
Reason
A reason for excluding the traffic. Select from the reasons provided.
Details (Optional)
A comment about the list, providing more information on why the traffic is excluded.
Manage exclusion lists
To manage exclusion lists directly:
Select an environment for abuse detection.
Select the Exclusions tab.
To create a new exclusion list, click Create . To edit an existing exclusion
list, select Edit in the more actions menu in the row for that list.

Limitations on abuse detection
Abuse detection has the following limitations.
Incidents whose Last event detected was over 14 days in the past are not displayed in the
Abuse detection UI. See Limitations on incidents and data displayed
for more information on what incidents and data are displayed in the UI.
When you first
enable
Advanced API for an organization , or re-enable it,
there will be a delay while events are clustered
into incidents. After that, there will be periodic delays.
The Incident details attribute page can take a brief time to load for
organizations with a large amount of traffic.
Exclusion lists support a maximum of 15 lists per environment with a maximum of 30 total CIDR
ranges and IP addresses per list.
AppGroups are not supported in Apigee hybrid at this time.
