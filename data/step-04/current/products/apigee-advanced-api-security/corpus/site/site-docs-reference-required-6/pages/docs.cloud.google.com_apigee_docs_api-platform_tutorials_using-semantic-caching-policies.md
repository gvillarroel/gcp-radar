Overview
The semantic caching policies help Apigee users with LLM models to intelligently
serve identical or semantically similar prompts efficiently, minimizing backend API calls and reducing resource consumption.
The SemanticCacheLookup and SemanticCachePopulate
policies attach to the request and response flows, respectively, of an Apigee API proxy.
When the proxy receives a request, the SemanticCacheLookup policy extracts the user prompt from the request and converts the prompt into a
numerical representation using the Text embeddings API. A semantic similarity search performs using Vector Search
to find similar prompts. If a similar prompt data point is found, a cache lookup performs. If cached data is found, the
cached response returns to the client.
If the similarity search does not return a similar previous prompt, the LLM model generates content in response to the
user prompt and populates the Apigee cache with the response. A feedback loop creates to update the Vector Search index entries
in preparation for future requests.
The following sections describe the steps to create and configure the semantic caching policies:
Configure a service account for the Vector Search index.
Create and deploy a Vector Search index.
Create an API proxy to enable semantic caching.
Configure the semantic caching policies.
Test the semantic caching policies.
Configure a service account for the Vector Search index
To configure a service account for the Vector Search index, complete the following steps:
Create a service account using the following command:
gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
--description = " DESCRIPTION " \
--display-name = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DISPLAY_NAME "
Where:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME is the name of the service account.
DESCRIPTION is a description of the service account.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DISPLAY_NAME is the display name of the service account.
For example:
gcloud iam service-accounts create ai-client \
--description = " semantic cache client " \
--display-name = " ai-client "
Grant the service account the AI Platform User role using the following command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ $PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/aiplatform.user"
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with the name of the service account created in the previous step.
Assign the IAM Service Account User role to the service account using the following command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ $PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with the name of the service account created in the previous step.
Create and deploy a Vector Search index
To create and deploy a Vector Search index:
Create a Vector Search index that allows streaming updates:
ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) && curl --location --request POST \
"https:// $REGION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ $PROJECT_ID /locations/ $REGION /indexes" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN " \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw \
'{
"displayName": "semantic-cache-index",
"description": "semantic-cache-index",
"metadata": {
"config": {
"dimensions": "768",
"approximateNeighborsCount": 150,
"distanceMeasureType": "DOT_PRODUCT_DISTANCE",
"featureNormType": "NONE",
"algorithmConfig": {
"treeAhConfig": {
"leafNodeEmbeddingCount": "10000",
"fractionLeafNodesToSearch": 0.05
}
},
"shardSize": "SHARD_SIZE_MEDIUM"
},
},
"indexUpdateMethod": "STREAM_UPDATE"
}'
The $REGION defines the region where the Vector Search index deploys. We recommend that you
use the same region as your Apigee instance. This environment variable was set in a previous step.
When this operation completes, you should see a response similar to the following:
{
"name" : "projects/976063410430/locations/us-west1/indexes/5695338290484346880/operations/9084564741162008576" ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.CreateIndexOperationMetadata" ,
"genericMetadata" : {
"createTime" : "2025-04-25T18:45:27.996136Z" ,
"updateTime" : "2025-04-25T18:45:27.996136Z"
}
}
}
For more information on creating Vector Search indexes, see Create an index .
Create an IndexEndpoint using the following command:
gcloud ai index-endpoints create \
--display-name = semantic-cache-index-endpoint \
--public-endpoint-enabled \
--region = $REGION \
--project = $PROJECT_ID
This step may take several minutes to complete. When it completes, you should see a response similar to the following:
Waiting for operation [ 8278420407862689792 ] ...done.
Created Vertex AI index endpoint: projects/976063410430/locations/us-west1/indexEndpoints/7953875911424606208.
For more information on creating an IndexEndpoint , see Create an IndexEndpoint .
Deploy the index to the endpoint using the following command:
INDEX_ENDPOINT_ID = $( gcloud ai index-endpoints list \
--project = $PROJECT_ID \
--region = $REGION \
--format = "json" | jq -c -r \
'.[] | select(.displayName=="semantic-cache-index-endpoint") | .name | split("/") | .[5]' \
) && INDEX_ID = $( gcloud ai indexes list \
--project = $PROJECT_ID \
--region = $REGION \
--format = "json" | jq -c -r \
'.[] | select(.displayName=="semantic-cache-index") | .name | split("/") | .[5]' \
) && gcloud ai index-endpoints deploy-index \
$INDEX_ENDPOINT_ID \
--deployed-index-id = semantic_cache \
--display-name = semantic-cache \
--index = $INDEX_ID \
--region = $REGION \
--project = $PROJECT_ID
Note: The command to deploy the index to the endpoint requires jq .
If this JSON processing utility is not already installed in your development environment, you can install it using the following command:
$ sudo apt install jq .
Initial deployment of an index to an endpoint can take between 20 and 30 minutes to complete. To check the status
of the operation, use the following command:
gcloud ai operations describe OPERATION_ID \
--project = $PROJECT_ID \
--region = $REGION
Confirm that the index deployed:
gcloud ai operations describe OPERATION_ID \
--index-endpoint = $INDEX_ENDPOINT_ID --region = $REGION --project = $PROJECT_ID
The command should return $ done: true .
Create an API proxy to enable semantic caching
In this step, create a new API proxy using the Proxy with Semantic Cache template, if you have not done so already.
Before creating the API proxy, set the following environment variable:
export PUBLIC_DOMAIN_NAME = $( gcloud ai index-endpoints describe $INDEX_ENDPOINT_ID --region = $REGION --project = $PROJECT_ID | grep "publicEndpointDomainName" | awk '{print $2}' )
To create a proxy for use with semantic caching:
Go to the API proxies page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to API proxies
Click the + Create to open the Create API proxy pane.
In the Proxy template box, select Proxy with Semantic Cache .
Enter the following details:
Proxy name : Enter the name of the proxy.
Description : (Optional) Enter a description of the proxy.
Target (Existing API) : Enter the URL of the backend service that the proxy calls. This
is the LLM model endpoint that generates content.
For this tutorial, set the Target (Existing API) to:
REGION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /publishers/google/models/gemini-2.0-flash-001:generateContent
Enter the following Semantic Cache URLs :
Note: You can also add these URLs to the XML configuration in the Proxy editor on the Develop tab.
Generate Embeddings URL : This Vertex AI service
converts text input into a numerical form for semantic analysis.
For this tutorial, set this URL to the following:
REGION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /publishers/google/models/text-embedding-004:predict
Query Nearest Neighbor URL : This Vertex AI service
searches for similar text input from previous requests in the Vector Search index to avoid reprocessing.
For this tutorial, set this URL to the following:
PUBLIC_DOMAIN_NAME /v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /indexEndpoints/ INDEX_ENDPOINT_ID :findNeighbors
The PUBLIC_DOMAIN_NAME and INDEX_ENDPOINT_ID values were set in an earlier step. To
obtain these values, use the following commands:
echo $PUBLIC_DOMAIN_NAME
echo $INDEX_ENDPOINT_ID
Upsert index URL : This Vertex AI service updates the index with new or modified entries.
For this tutorial, set this URL to the following:
REGION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /indexes/ INDEX_ID :upsertDatapoints
Click Next .
Click Create .
The API proxy's XML configuration appears in the Develop tab. SemanticCacheLookup and SemanticCachePopulate
policies containing default values are already attached to the proxy request and response flows.
Note : The SemanticCachePopulate and SemanticCacheLookup policies support the use of URL templating for these elements.
If you wish, you can provide a variable in this element to hold the value of the URL, as shown in
the following example:
<URL>https://{URL_VARIABLE}</URL>
Configure the semantic caching policies
View the XML configuration of each policy by clicking on the policy name in the Detail view of the
API proxy's Develop tab. Edit the policy XML directly in the Code view of
the Develop tab.
Edit the policies:
SemanticCacheLookup policy:
Remove the <UserPromptSource> element to use the default value.
Update the <DeployedIndexId> element to use the value semantic_cache .
Configure the semantic similarity <Threshold> value to determine when two prompts are considered a match.
The default is 0.9, but you can adjust this value based on your application's sensitivity. The bigger the number,
the more closely prompts have to be related to be considered a cache hit. For this tutorial,
we recommend setting this value to 0.95 .
Click Save .
SemanticCachePopulate policy:
Set the <TTLInSeconds> element to specify the number of seconds until the cache expires, in seconds.
The default value is 60s . Note that Apigee ignores any cache-control headers it receives from the LLM model.
Click Save .
Add Google authentication to the API proxy
You must also add Google authentication to the API proxy's target endpoint to enable proxy calls to the target.
To add the Google access token:
In the Develop tab, click default under the Target endpoints folder. The
Code view displays the XML configuration of the <TargetEndpoint> element.
Edit the XML to add the following configuration under <HTTPTargetConnection> :
<Authentication>
<GoogleAccessToken>
<Scopes>
<Scope>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform</Scope>
</Scopes>
</GoogleAccessToken>
</Authentication>
Click Save .
Deploy the API proxy
To deploy the API proxy:
Click Deploy to open the Deploy API proxy pane.
The Revision field should be set to 1 . If not, click 1 to select it.
In the Environment list, select the environment where you want to deploy the proxy. The environment
must be a Comprehensive environment.
Enter the Service account you created in an earlier step.
Click Deploy .
Test the semantic caching policies
To test the semantic caching policies:
Send a request to the proxy using the following command:
curl https:// $RUNTIME_HOSTNAME / PROXY_NAME -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{
"contents": [
{
"role": "user",
"parts": [
{
"text": "Why is the sky blue?"
}
]
}
]
}'
Replace PROXY_NAME with the basepath of the API proxy you deployed in the previous step.
Repeat the API call, substituting the prompt string with the following semantically similar prompt strings:
Why is the sky blue?
What makes the sky blue?
Why is the sky blue colored?
Can you explain why the sky is blue?
The sky is blue, why is that?
Compare the response time for each call once a similar prompt has been cached.
To verify that your calls are being served from cache, check the response headers. A Cached-Content: true header attaches.
Best practices
We recommend incorporating the following best practices to your API management program when using the semantic caching policies:
Prevent caching of sensitive data with Model Armor.
To prevent caching of sensitive data, we recommend using Model Armor for content filtering.
Model Armor can flag responses as non-cacheable if it detects sensitive information. For more information, see the
Model Armor overview .
Manage data freshness with Vertex AI data point invalidation and Time-to-Live (TTL).
We recommend implementing appropriate data point invalidation strategies to ensure that cached responses are
up-to-date and reflect the latest information from your backend systems. To learn more, see
Update and rebuild an active index .
You can also adjust the TTL for cached responses based on the data's volatility and frequency of updates. For more information
on using TTL in the SemanticCachePopulate policy, see <TTLInSeconds> .
Use predefined caching strategies to ensure the most accurate response data.
We recommend implementing predefined caching strategies similar to the following:
Generic AI responses : Configure a long TTL (for example, one hour) for non-user-specific responses.
User-specific responses : Do not implement caching, or set a short TTL (for example, five minutes) for responses that
contain user-specific information.
Time-sensitive responses : Configure a short TTL (for example, five minutes)
for responses that require real-time or frequent updates.
Increase quotas for dependent services
If you experience performance bottlenecks resulting from higher queries per second (QPS), you may need to increase the following quotas for
dependent services in your Google Cloud project:
Online prediction requests per minute per region (select by region)
Regional online prediction requests per base model per minute per region (select by region and the textembedding-gecko model)
Matching Engine stream update requests per minute per region (select by region)
To increase a quota for one of these services:
Go to the Quota & System Limits page:
Go to Quota & System Limits
In the filter bar, enter name of the specific quota you want to increase, along with the region and model , name if relevant.
For example, filter by Regional online prediction requests per base model per minute per region and textembedding-gecko and us-west1 .
Click the
more_vert
menu for the service you want to increase and then select Edit quota .
Enter a new, higher value for the quota.
Click Done .
Click Submit request .
After submitting your request, the quota increase processes. You can monitor the status on the Quotas & System Limits page using the
Increase requests tab.
Limitations
The following limitations apply to the semantic caching policies:
The maximum cacheable text size is 256 KB. For more information, see the Cache value size on the Apigee Limits page.
Apigee ignores any cache-control headers it receives from the LLM model.
If the cache is not invalidated properly or if the semantic similarity algorithm is not sufficiently
accurate to differentiate between inputs with very similar meanings, the response may return outdated or incorrect information.
For more information on configuring TTL to manage data freshness, see the Best practices section.
For more information on configuring the semantic similarity threshold, see the Configure the semantic caching policies section.
For more information on tuning the semantic similarity algorithm, see Filter vector matches .
The Vector Search feature is not supported in all regions. For a list of supported regions, see the
Feature availability section of the Vertex AI Locations page. If your Apigee organization
is in an unsupported region, you will have to create index endpoints in a different region than your Apigee organization.
The semantic caching policies are not supported for use with API proxies using EventFlows for continuous response streaming of server-sent events (SSE) .
The semantic caching policies use LLM APIs, which can result in higher latencies in the 100s of milliseconds.
In Apigee hybrid installations, support for the semantic caching policies is limited to installations on Google Cloud Platform.
Apigee hybrid does not support forward proxy with the semantic caching policies.
