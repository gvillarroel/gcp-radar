This tutorial shows how to secure an API proxy using an OAuth 2.0 access token .
Before you begin
To complete this tutorial, you must have access to an Apigee organization where you
have permission to:
Create and deploy API proxies
Create API products
Create developer apps
You must also have a properly configured environment group hostname with which you can
make Apigee API proxy calls. If you are unsure about
which environment group hostname to use, see your Apigee administrator.
Deploy the OAuth 2.0 proxy
We provide an API proxy on GitHub that is configured to generate OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Follow these steps to
download and deploy this API proxy to your environment:
Download the oauth sample API proxy to a directory on your file
system.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Proxy development > API proxies page.
Go to API proxies
Note: Before you continue, look or search through your list of API
proxies. If you already have one called oauth , click it and skip to the
next section to make sure it's configured the same as what's described. If yours is
different, either delete it and continue these steps, or modify it to match the
configuration described.
In the API Proxies pane, click + Create .
In the Create a proxy pane, under Proxy template ,
select Upload proxy bundle .
Choose the oauth.zip file you downloaded, and click
Next .
Click Next .
Deploy (optional) :
Deployment environments : Optional. Use the checkboxes to select one or more
environments in which to deploy your proxy. If you prefer not to deploy the proxy at this
point, leave the Deployment environments field empty. You can always deploy
the proxy later.
Service Account : Optional. Attach a service account to your deployment to enable your
proxy to access Google Cloud services, as specified in the service account's role and permissions.
Click Create .
You've successfully downloaded and deployed an access token-generating API
proxy to your Apigee organization.
View the OAuth 2.0 flow and policy
Take a few moments to examine the OAuth 2.0 policy configuration.
Next, you'll take a closer look at what the API proxy contains.
In the API proxy editor, click the Develop tab.
In the left-hand
pane, you'll see two policies. You'll also see two POST flows in the Proxy Endpoints
section.
Click AccessTokenClientCredential under Proxy Endpoints .
The text editor displays the XML code for the
AccessTokenClientCredential conditional flow:
<Flow name="AccessTokenClientCredential">
<Description/>
<Request>
<Step>
<Name> GenerateAccessTokenClient </Name>
</Step>
</Request>
<Response/>
<Condition>(proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/accesstoken") and (request.verb = "POST")</Condition>
</Flow>
A flow is a processing step in an API proxy. In this case, the flow is triggered when
a certain condition is met (it's called a "conditional flow"). The condition, defined in
the <Condition> element, says that if the API proxy call is made to
the /accesstoken resource, and the request verb is POST , then
execute the GenerateAccessTokenClient policy, which generates the access
token.
Now let's look at the policy the conditional flow will trigger. Click the
GenerateAccessTokenClient policy in the Request pane:
The following XML configuration is displayed:
< OAuthV2 name = "GenerateAccessTokenClient" >
< ! -- This policy generates an OAuth 2.0 access token using the client_credentials grant type -- >
< Operation>GenerateAccessToken < / Operation >
< ! -- This is in milliseconds , so expire in an hour -- >
< ExpiresIn>3600000 < / ExpiresIn >
< SupportedGrantTypes >
< ! -- This part is very important : most real OAuth 2.0 apps will want to use other
grant types . In this case it is important to NOT include the "client_credentials"
type because it allows a client to get access to a token with no user authentication -- >
< GrantType>client_credentials < / GrantType >
< / SupportedGrantTypes >
< GrantType>request . queryparam . grant_type < / GrantType >
< GenerateResponse / >
< / OAuthV2 >
The configuration includes the following:
The <Operation> , which can be one of several predefined values,
defines what the policy is going to do. In this case, it's going to generate an access
token.
The token will expire 1 hour (3600000 milliseconds) after being generated.
In <SupportedGrantTypes> , the OAuth 2.0
<GrantType> expected to be used is client_credentials
(exchanging a consumer key and secret for an OAuth 2.0 token).
The second <GrantType> element tells the policy where to look in
the API call for the grant type parameter, as required by the OAuth 2.0 specification.
(You'll see this in the API call later). The grant type could also be sent in the HTTP
header ( request.header.grant_type ) or as a form parameter
( request.formparam.grant_type ).
You don't need to do anything else with the API proxy at the moment. In later steps,
you'll use this API proxy to generate an OAuth 2.0 access token. But first, you need to do a few
more things:
Create the API proxy you actually want to secure with OAuth 2.0.
Create a few more artifacts that will result in the consumer key and consumer secret
you need to exchange for an access token.
Note: The RefreshAccessToken flow and policy in the API proxy
isn't used in this tutorial and isn't supported with the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant
type.
Create a protected API proxy
Now you're going to create the API proxy you want to protect. This is the API call that
returns something you want. In this case, the API proxy will call Apigee's mocktarget service
to return your IP address. BUT, you'll get to see it only if you pass a valid OAuth 2.0 access
token with your API call.
The API proxy you create here will include a policy that checks for an OAuth 2.0 token in the
request.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Proxy development > API proxies page.
Go to API proxies
In the API Proxies pane, click + Create .
In the Create a proxy pane, under Proxy template ,
select Reverse proxy (most common) .
Configure the proxy with the following:
In this field
do this
Proxy Name
Enter: helloworld_oauth2
Base Path
Change to: /hellooauth2
The Project Base Path is part of the URL used to make requests to the API
proxy.
Description
Enter: hello world protected by OAuth 2.0
Target (Existing API)
Enter: https://mocktarget.apigee.net/ip
This defines the target URL that Apigee invokes on a request to the API
proxy.
Click Next .
Deploy (optional) :
Deployment environments : Optional. Use the checkboxes to select one or more
environments in which to deploy your proxy. If you prefer not to deploy the proxy at this
point, leave the Deployment environments field empty. You can always deploy
the proxy later.
Service Account : Optional. Attach a service account to your deployment to enable your
proxy to access Google Cloud services, as specified in the service account's role and permissions.
Click Create .
Click the Develop tab of the helloworld_oauth2 proxy.
In the Policies menu, Click
control_point
Add policy .
In the Create policy pane, Select OAuth 2.0 .
Click Create .
View the policies
Let's take a closer look at what you've created.
In the API proxy editor, click the Develop tab. You'll see that two
policies have been added to the request flow of the API proxy:
Verify OAuth v2.0 Access Token – Checks the API call to make
sure a valid OAuth 2.0 token is present.
Remove Header Authorization – An Assign Message policy that
removes the access token after it's checked, so that it doesn't get passed to the
target service. (If the target service needed the OAuth 2.0 access token, you wouldn't use
this policy).
Click the Verify OAuth v2.0 Access Token icon in the
right-hand pane and
look at the XML below it in the text editor.
<OAuthV2 async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="verify-oauth-v2-access-token">
<DisplayName>Verify OAuth v2.0 Access Token</DisplayName>
<Operation>VerifyAccessToken</Operation>
</OAuthV2>
Notice that the <Operation> is VerifyAccessToken . The
Operation defines what the policy is supposed to do. In this case, it's going to check
for a valid OAuth 2.0 token in the request.
Add an API product
To obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token, you need to create three Apigee entities: an API product,
a developer, and a developer app.
Create the API product:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Distribution > API products page.
Go to API products
Click + Create .
Enter the Product details for your API product.
Field
Description
Name
Internal name of the API product. Do not specify special characters in the name. Note: You cannot edit the name once the API product is created.
Display name
Display name for the API product. The display name is used in the UI and you can edit it at any time. If not specified, the Name value will be used. This field is auto-filled using the Name value; you can edit or delete its contents. The display name can include special characters.
Description
Description of the API product.
Environment
Environments to which the API product will allow access. Select the environment to which
you deployed the API proxy.
Access
Select Public .
Automatically approve access requests
Enable automatic approval of key requests for this API product from any app.
Quota
Ignore for this tutorial.
Allowed OAuth 2.0 Scopes
Ignore for this tutorial.
In the Operations section, click Add An Operation .
In the API Proxy field, select the API proxy you just created.
In the Path field, enter "/". Ignore the other fields.
Click Save to save the Operation.
Click Save to save the API product.
Add a developer and app to your
organization
Next, you're going to simulate the workflow of a developer signing up to use your APIs.
Ideally, developers register themselves and their apps through your developer portal. In this
step, though, you'll add a developer and an app as an administrator.
A developer will have one or more apps that call your APIs, and each app gets a unique
consumer key and consumer secret. This key/secret-per-app also gives you, the API provider,
more granular control over access to your APIs and more granular analytics reporting on API
traffic, because Apigee knows which developer and app belong to which OAuth 2.0 token.
Create a developer
Let's create a developer named Nigel Tufnel.
Open the Developer editor.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Distribution > Developers page.
Go to Developers
Click + Create .
Enter the following in the Add Developer window:
In this field
Enter
First Name
Nigel
Last Name
Tufnel
Email
nigel@example.com
Username
nigel
Click Add .
Register an app
Let's create an app for Nigel.
In the Google Cloud console, go to Apigee > Distribution > Apps page.
Go to Apps
Click + Create .
Enter the following in the New App window:
In this field
do this
Name and Display Name
Enter: nigel_app
Developer
Click Developer and select: Nigel Tufnel (nigel@example.com)
Callback URL and Notes
Leave blank
Click + Add Credentials .
Click + Add Products .
Select the API product you just created.
Click Add .
Click Create .
Get the
consumer key and consumer secret
Now you'll get the consumer key and consumer secret that will be exchanged for an OAuth 2.0
access token.
Open the nigel_app page.
Ensure that the nigel_app page is displayed. If not,
go to the Distribution > Apps page.
Go to Apps
On the nigel_app page, click
visibility_off in the Key and Secret columns. Notice that the key/secret are associated with the API product that you created earlier.
Select and copy the Key and Secret values. Paste them in a temporary
text file. You'll use them in a later step, where you call the API proxy that will
exchange these credentials for an OAuth 2.0 access token.
Try calling the API to get your IP address
(fail!)
Try calling the protected API proxy that you just created. Notice that you are
not passing an OAuth 2.0 access token in the call.
where YOUR ENV_GROUP_HOSTNAME is the environment group hostname. See
Find the environment group hostname .
Because the API proxy has the Verify OAuth v2.0 Access Token policy
checking for a valid OAuth 2.0 token in the request, the call should fail with the following
message:
{"fault":{"faultstring":"Invalid access token","detail":{"errorcode":"oauth.v2.InvalidAccessToken"}}}
In this case, failure is good! It means your API proxy is much more secure. Only trusted
apps with a valid OAuth 2.0 access token can successfully call this API.
Get an OAuth 2.0 access token
Next, you will use the key and secret you
copied and pasted into a text file and exchange them for an OAuth 2.0 access token. You're now
going to make an API call to the API sample proxy you imported, oauth , which
will generate an API access token.
Using that key and secret, make the following cURL call (note that the protocol is
https ):
curl - X POST - H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
"https:// YOUR ENV_GROUP_HOSTNAME /oauth/client_credential/accesstoken?grant_type=client_credentials" \
- d "client_id= CLIENT_KEY &client_secret= CLIENT_SECRET "
Note that if you're using a client like Postman to make the call, the
client_id and client_secret go in the Body of the
request and must be x-www-form-urlencoded .
You should get a response like this:
{
"issued_at" : "1466025769306" ,
"application_name" : "716bbe61-f14a-4d85-9b56-a62ff8e0d347" ,
"scope" : "" ,
"status" : "approved" ,
"api_product_list" : "[helloworld_oauth2-Product]" ,
"expires_in" : "3599" , //--in seconds
"developer.email" : "nigel@example.com" ,
"token_type" : "BearerToken" ,
"client_id" : "xNnREu1DNGfiwzQZ5HUN8IAUwZSW1GZW" ,
"access_token" : "GTPY9VUHCqKVMRB0cHxnmAp0RXc0" ,
"organization_name" : "myOrg" ,
"refresh_token_expires_in" : "0" , //--in seconds
"refresh_count" : "0"
}
You got your OAuth 2.0 access token! Copy the access_token value (without the quote marks) and
paste it into your text file. You'll use it in a moment.
What just happened?
Remember previously when you looked at that "conditional flow" in the
oauth proxy, the one that said if the resource URI is
/accesstoken and the request verb is POST , to execute the
GenerateAccessTokenClient OAuth 2.0 policy that generates an access token? Your cURL
command met those conditions, so the OAuth 2.0 policy was executed. It verified your consumer key
and consumer secret and exchanged them for an OAuth 2.0 token that expires in 1 hour.
Call the API with an access token (success!)
Now that you have an access token, you can use it to call the API proxy. Make the
following cURL call. Substitute your Apigee organization name and the access token.
curl https:// YOUR ENV_GROUP_HOSTNAME /hellooauth2 -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN "
You should now get a successful call to the API proxy that returns your IP address. For
example:
{"ip":"::ffff:192.168.14.136"}
You can repeat that API call for close to an hour, after which time the access token will
expire. To make the call after an hour, you'll need to generate a new access token using the
previous steps.
Congratulations! You've created an API proxy and protected it by requiring that a valid
OAuth 2.0 access token be included in the call.
