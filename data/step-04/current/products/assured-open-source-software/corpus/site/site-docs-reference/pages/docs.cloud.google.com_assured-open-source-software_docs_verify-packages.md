Verify signatures in the Assured OSS free tier
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to verify the signature on the Assured OSS
artifacts.
This page applies to the free tier only. For the premium tier, see Access
security metadata and verify
packages .
Package verification
Package signatures are stored separately from the package in a Cloud Storage
bucket in a zip format.
You can verify signatures using the
Assured OSS verifier tool ( aoss-verifier ) or using a verification script.
Using the aoss-verifier tool
Before using this tool, make sure Go is installed on your system. If Go is not
installed, install Go from the Go website .
To verify the authenticity and integrity of open source software packages,
install the aoss-verifier
tool.
Export $(go env GOPATH)/bin , and run the aoss-verifier verify-package command.
aoss-verifier verify-package \
--language LANGUAGE \
--package_id PACKAGE_ID \
--version VERSION \
--artifact_path ARTIFACT_PATH \
[ --disable_certificate_verification ] \
[ --temp_downloads_path TEMP_DOWNLOADS_DIR_PATH ] \
[ --disable_deletes ]
Replace the following:
LANGUAGE : The programming package language,
either java or python . The value must be in lower case.
PACKAGE_ID : for Java, it's
groupId:artifactId and for Python it's
packageName . The value must be in lower case.
VERSION : The version of the package.
ARTIFACT_PATH : The path to the data file in your
local directory that you want to verify. Use the following filename
extensions:
jar file extension for a Java package
whl file extension for a Python package
--disable_certificate_verification is an optional flag which skips matching
leaf certificate to the root certificate through the certificate chain, if
used.
--temp_downloads_path is an optional flag to set the path where you want to
download the files. (replace TEMP_DOWNLOADS_DIR_PATH ).
If this flag isn't set, the files are downloaded to the tmp_downloads folder in the
current directory.
--disable_deletes is an optional flag which keeps the downloaded files. By
default, the tool cleans all the downloaded files.
Refer the README
for further information.
Using verification script
This section describes how to use a verification script to verify the signatures
of downloaded packages.
Step 1: Get the signature URL
The URL of the zip file is available in the
security metadata of each package. The following example is a sample from
Container Analysis metadata .
As shown in the following example, you can find the signature zip URL in the
description: digestUrl field.
package {
distribution {
cpe_uri: "cpe:2.3:a:JAVA::com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.13.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"
maintainer: "<nil>"
url: "https://us-maven.pkg.dev/cloud-aoss/cloud-aoss-java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-databind/2.13.3/jackson-databind-2.13.3.jar"
description: "{\n \"artifactMetadataList\": [\n {\n \"digestUrl\": \ "gs://cloud-aoss/java/com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind/2.13.3/jackson-databind-2.13.3_binary_2022-10-12T06:54:05Z.zip \"\n }\n ]\n}"
}
distribution {
cpe_uri: "cpe:2.3:a:JAVA::com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.13.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"
url: "https://us-maven.pkg.dev/cloud-aoss/cloud-aoss-java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-databind/2.13.3/jackson-databind-2.13.3-sources.jar"
description: "{\n \"digestUrl\": \"gs://cloud-aoss/java/com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind/2.13.3/jackson-databind-2.13.3-sources_source_2022-10-12T06:54:05Z.zip\"\n}"
}
}
Sample example from Cloud Storage metadata ( buildInfo.json file ). As shown
in the following example, you can get the signature zip URL from the
externalRefs : referenceLocator field.
"packages": [
{
"SPDXID": "SPDXRef-Package-logback-core-1.2.11.jar",
"checksums": [
{
"algorithm": "SHA256",
"checksumValue": "c847e0e310acda8bc1347c9d9cc051e91210b9f943e131fceb5034c2f0c9a5d8"
}
],
"downloadLocation": "https://us-maven.pkg.dev/cloud-aoss/cloud-aoss-java/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.2.11/logback-core-1.2.11.jar",
"externalRefs": [
{
"referenceCategory": "SECURITY",
"referenceLocator": "cpe:2.3:a:*:JAVA\\:\\:ch\\.qos\\.logback\\:logback\\-core:1\\.2\\.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*",
"referenceType": "cpe23Type"
},
{
"referenceCategory": "OTHER",
"referenceLocator": " gs://cloud-aoss/java/ch.qos.logback:logback-core/1.2.11/logback-core-1.2.11_binary_2022-10-12T14:19:11Z.zip" ,
"referenceType": "digestURL"
}
],
You can use the local signature zip for manual verification or
the Cloud Storage URL directly for using the verification script. You can download
the signature.zip file using the following steps:
Set up authentication using Application Default Credentials (ADC).
Download the signature.zip using the following command:
gcloud storage cp SIGNATURE_ZIP_URL PATH_TO_LOCAL_STORE --recursive
Replace the following:
SIGNATURE_ZIP_URL : the signature zip URL.
PATH_TO_LOCAL_STORE : the local path where you want
to download the file.
Step 2: Get the root certificate
To access the root certificate, use the following URL:
https://privateca-content-6333d504-0000-2df7-afd6-30fd38154590.storage.googleapis.com/a2c725a592f1d586f1f8/ca.crt
You can download the certificate locally or use the certificate link directly.
To download the certificate, run the following command:
curl -o PATH_TO_LOCAL_STORE /ca.crt https://privateca-content-6333d504-0000-2df7-afd6-30fd38154590.storage.googleapis.com/a2c725a592f1d586f1f8/ca.crt
Replace PATH_TO_LOCAL_STORE with the local path where
you want to download the certificate.
Step 3: Get the package file location
The file we would be verifying is the jar for Java packages and wheel
file for Python packages. That file would be the PATH_TO_DATA_FILE for
verification.
Step 4: Verification
You can manually verify the signature zip using the steps at
manual signature verification
or can use the verification script .
To verify using verification script, run the following commands:
Download the verification script and give permissions.
gcloud storage cp "gs://cloud-aoss/utils/signature-verification/v1.0/signatureverification.sh" . --recursive
chmod +x signatureverification.sh
Run the verification script and verify. You can use the remote URLs or
local paths for signature zip and root certificate.
./signatureverification.sh --data_file_path PATH_TO_DATA_FILE --signature_url SIGNATURE_ZIP_URL --root_cert_url ROOT_CERT_URL
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_DATA_FILE with the path to the package file identified in step 3
SIGNATURE_ZIP_URL with the signature zip URL obtained in step 1.
ROOT_CERT_URL with the root certificate URL obtained in step 2.
Metadata verification
This section explains how you can verify the signature on the
Assured OSS metadata accessed using Cloud Storage.
Use the aoss-verifier tool
Use the aoss-verifier tool to verify metadata.
Before using this tool, install Go .
Install the
aoss-verifier tool.
Export $(go env GOPATH)/bin , and run the aoss-verifier verify-metadata
command.
aoss-verifier verify-metadata \
--metadata_type TYPE \
--language LANGUAGE \
--package_id PACKAGE_ID \
--version VERSION \
[ --disable_certificate_verification ] \
[ --temp_downloads_path TEMP_DOWNLOADS_DIR_PATH ] \
[ --disable_deletes ]
Replace the following:
TYPE : The possible values are buildinfo ,
vexinfo , and healthinfo .
LANGUAGE : The programming package language,
either java or python . The value must be in lower case.
PACKAGE_ID : For Java, the format is
groupId:artifactId . For Python, the format is
packageName . The value must be in lower case.
VERSION : The version of the package.
--disable_certificate_verification is an optional flag which skips matching
the leaf certificate to the root certificate through the certificate chain, if
used.
--temp_downloads_path is an optional flag to set the path where you want to
download the files (replace TEMP_DOWNLOADS_DIR_PATH ).
If this flag isn't set, the files are downloaded to the tmp_downloads folder in the
current directory.
--disable_deletes is an optional flag which keeps the downloaded files. By
default, the tool cleans all the downloaded files.
For more information, see the README .
Using verification script
This section describes how to use a verification script to verify the security
metadata file.
Step 1: Get the signature zip and metadata file
We can access the metadata as in Access Metadata .
The metadata file would be present with the signature.zip file.
Example - contents of buildInfo.zip
buildInfo.json
signature.zip
The buildInfo.json is the metadata file required to be verified and the
signature.zip is the signature zip.
Step 2: Get the root certificate
Use the following URL link to get the root certificate:
https://privateca-content-6333d504-0000-2df7-afd6-30fd38154590.storage.googleapis.com/a2c725a592f1d586f1f8/ca.crt
You can download the certificate locally or use the certificate link directly.
To download the certificate, run the following command:
curl -o PATH_TO_LOCAL_STORE /ca.crt https://privateca-content-6333d504-0000-2df7-afd6-30fd38154590.storage.googleapis.com/a2c725a592f1d586f1f8/ca.crt
Replace PATH_TO_LOCAL_STORE with the local path where
you want to download the certificate.
Step 3: Verification
You can verify the signature.zip using manual verification or by
using the verification script .
To verify using verification script, run the following commands:
Download the verification script and give permissions.
gcloud storage cp "gs://cloud-aoss/utils/signature-verification/v1.0/signatureverification.sh" . --recursive
chmod +x signatureverification.sh
Run the verification script and verify. You should use the local path for
the signature zip. For the root certificate, you can use either the URL or
local path. The data file would be the metadata file we are verifying -
buildInfo.json , vexInfo.json or healthInfo.json .
./signatureverification.sh --data_file_path PATH_TO_DATA_FILE --signature_local_path SIGNATURE_LOCAL_PATH --root_cert_url ROOT_CERT_URL
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_DATA_FILE with the metadata file we are
verifying as obtained in Step 1.
SIGNATURE_LOCAL_PATH with the signature zip URL
obtained in step 1.
ROOT_CERT_URL with the root
certificate URL obtained in step 2.
In case you want to use a local certificate already downloaded, use this
option instead:
--root_cert_local ROOT_CERT_LOCAL
Replace ROOT_CERT_LOCAL with the local certificate path.
Utility script verification
Assured OSS provides three utility scripts. This section describes
how to verify the signature on these scripts.
