Subscribe to notifications
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Assured Open Source Software (Assured OSS) publishes two types of notifications:
Package availability: These notifications contain information about new
packages and package versions that are added to Assured OSS and
updates regarding the package onboarding status.
Vulnerability notifications: These notifications contain information about
new vulnerabilities detected in the packages that are curated by
Assured OSS or updates to existing vulnerabilities.
Programmatic notifications about updates on security metadata and new packages
are published on Pub/Sub topics. These
notifications are available in JSON format. You can create a pull subscription
or push subscription to the
Assured OSS topic to receive notifications.
To create these subscriptions, use the same service account
or workload identity credentials that you use to access artifacts or metadata.
When your access to Assured OSS is enabled, the service accounts
are granted permission to create subscriptions on these topics.
The following sections describe the Pub/Sub topics.
This document applies to both the premium tier and free tier.
Before you begin
For the Assured OSS premium tier, if you enabled
VPC Service Controls, configure the egress
rule .
Package onboarding topic
Topic Name: projects/cloud-aoss/topics/package_onboarding

"package_name" string
"package_version" string
"language" string
"onboarding_status" string
"notification_status" string
}
Message Data Attributes:
"PackageName" string
"PackageVersion" string

"vulnerabilityId" string
"notificationStatus" string
}

Consolidated package onboarding and vulnerability information topic for premium tier
You can access all Assured OSS notifications from the following
Pub/Sub topic:
projects/assuredoss-blue/topics/assuredoss-notifications
Notification attributes
The following notification
attributes
are part of the published Pub/Sub message. You can use these
attributes to filter the message.
{
"Type" : "string" , // Indicates the type of notification, can be 'PackageVersion' or 'Vulnerability'
"PackageName" : "string" , // Package ID
"PackageVersion" : "string" , // Version of the package
"Language" : "string" , // Language of the package
"SchemaVersion" : int , // Schema version of the data in message
"GenerateTime" : "string" // Time at which the event occurred
}
The GenerateTime attribute is in
RFC 3339
format.
Package-related notifications
When the Type attribute is PackageVersion , the
message data
has the following fields:
{
"PackageName" : "string" , // Package ID
"PackageVersion" : "string" , // Version of the package
"Language" : "string" , // Language of the package
"NotificationStatus" : "string" // Status of package-version,'New' indicates available to download from Assured OSS
}
Vulnerability-related notifications
When the Type attribute is Vulnerability , the
message data
has the following fields:
{
"ID" : "string" , // Vulnerability ID affecting the package
"Severity" : "string" , // Severity of the vulnerability
"Sources" : [
{
"Name" : "string" , // Source of vulnerability information
"Link" : "string" // URL of vulnerability details
}
] ,
"Summary" : "string" , // Summary of vulnerability
"Description" : "string" , // Detailed description of vulnerability
"PackageName" : "string" , // Package ID
"PackageVersion" : "string" , // Version of the package
"Language" : "string" , // Language of the package
"NotificationStatus" : "string" // Status of package-version
}
The value of the NotificationStatus field indicates the status of the
vulnerability. If the vulnerability is new for a package, the value
is New . If there is an update to an existing vulnerability, the
value is Update .
Create a pull subscription
To create a pull subscription, complete the following:
Create a pull subscription . You can use the
Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or Pub/Sub API.
Note: If using the Pub/Sub API, enable the API first for the parent
project of the service account you are using for Assured OSS.
After you have created the pull subscription, start polling for messages
by using client libraries or the Google Cloud CLI .
Create a push subscription
Note: Push subscriptions cannot be created by premium tier customers.
To create a push subscription, set up an HTTPS server with a certificate that
isn't self-signed and that is accessible on the internet. Use the push
subscription model in one of the following ways:
If you have a Google Cloud project and service account (for example, you
integrated Assured OSS with Security Command Center):
Because Assured OSS provides permission to create subscriptions,
you can create your own push subscriptions and associate them with the
endpoint of your choice. For more information, see Push subscriptions .
If you are using the free tier and you don't have a Google Cloud project and
service account, enter the HTTPS endpoint in the Enable Access or Update
Notification Preferences form . The Assured OSS
team will create a push subscription and attach the endpoint with that
subscription.
