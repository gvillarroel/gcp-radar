Page Summary
outlined_flag
The Google Chat API enables sending messages as a Chat app or on behalf of a user.
Chat apps can send rich messages with text, cards, and interactive elements, while user-sent messages are limited to text.
Messages can be sent to spaces, users directly, or within specific threads using a thread_key .
Developers can assign custom IDs to messages for easier retrieval and management.
Code examples in Node.js and Python are provided to guide developers in implementing message sending functionalities.
This guide explains how to use the
create()
method on the Message resource of the Google Chat API to do any of the following:
Send messages that contain text, cards, and interactive widgets.
Send messages privately to a specific Chat user.
Start or reply to a message thread.
Name a message, so that you can specify it in other Chat API
requests.
The maximum message size (including any text or cards) is 32,000 bytes.
To send a message that exceeds this size, your Chat app
must send multiple messages instead.
In addition to calling the Chat API to create messages,
Chat apps can create and send messages to reply to user
interactions, such as posting a welcome message after a user adds the
Chat app to a space. When responding to interactions,
Chat apps can use other types of messaging features, including
interactive dialogs and link preview interfaces. To reply to a user, the
Chat app returns the message synchronously, without
calling the Chat API. To learn about sending messages to respond to
interactions, see
Receive and respond to interactions with your Google Chat app .
For more examples, see Google Chat app samples .
How Chat displays and attributes messages created with the Chat API
You can call the create() method using
app authentication
and user authentication .
Chat attributes the message sender differently
depending on the type of authentication that you use.
When you authenticate as the Chat app,
the Chat app sends the message.
Figure 1 : With app authentication, the Chat app sends
the message. To note that the sender isn't a person, Chat displays App next to its name.
When you authenticate as a user, the Chat app sends the
message on behalf of the user. Chat also attributes the
Chat app to the message by displaying its name.
Figure 2 : With user authentication, the user sends the message, and Chat displays the
Chat app name next to the user's name.
The authentication type also determines which messaging features and interfaces
that you can include in the message. With app authentication,
Chat apps can send messages that contain rich text,
card-based interfaces, and interactive widgets.
With user authentication, you can send text messages. In
Developer Preview , you can
also send cards, as documented in
Create and update cards .
To learn more about messaging
features available for the Chat API, see the
Google Chat messages overview .
This guide explains how to use either authentication type to send a message
with the Chat API.

and REST interfaces, see
Google Chat API overview .
Send a message as the Chat app
This section explains how to send messages that contain text, cards, and
interactive accessory widgets using
app authentication .
Figure 4. A Chat app sends a message with
text, a card, and an accessory button.
To call the CreateMessage()
method using app authentication, you must specify the following fields in the
request:
The chat.bot
authorization scope .
The
Space
resource in which you want to post the message. The
Chat app must be a member of the space.
The
Message
resource to create. To define the content of the message, you can include
rich text
( text ),
one or more card interfaces
( cardsV2 ),
or both.
Optionally, you can include the following:
The accessoryWidgets field to include
interactive buttons at the bottom of the message .
The privateMessageViewer field to
send the message privately to a specified user.
The messageId field, which lets you
name the message to use in other API requests.
The thread.threadKey and messageReplyOption fields to
start or reply to a thread . If the space doesn't
use threading, this field is ignored.
The following code shows an example of how a Chat app
can send a message posted as the Chat app that contains
text, a card, and a clickable button at the bottom of the message:

}
To run this sample, replace SPACE_NAME with the ID from
the space's
name
field. You can obtain the ID by calling the
ListSpaces()
method or from the space's URL.
Add interactive widgets at the bottom of a message
In the first code sample of this guide, the
Chat app message displays a clickable button at the
bottom of the message, known as an accessory widget . Accessory widgets
appear after any text or cards in a message. You can use these widgets to prompt
users to interact with your message in many ways, including the following:
Rate the accuracy or satisfaction of a message.
Report an issue with the message or Chat app.
Open a link to related content, such as documentation.
Dismiss or snooze similar messages from the Chat app
for a specific period of time.
To add accessory widgets, include the
accessoryWidgets[]
field in the body of your request and specify one or more widgets that you want
to include.
The following image shows a Chat app that appends
a text message with accessory widgets so that users can rate their experience
with the Chat app.
Figure 5 : A Chat app message with
text and accessory widgets.
The following shows the body of the request that creates a text message with
two accessory buttons. When a user clicks a button, the corresponding
function (such as doUpvote ) processes the interaction:
{
text : "Rate your experience with this Chat app." ,
accessoryWidgets : [{ buttonList : { buttons : [{
icon : { material_icon : {
name : "thumb_up"
}},
color : { red : 0 , blue : 255 , green : 0 },
onClick : { action : {
function : "doUpvote"
}}
}, {
icon : { material_icon : {
name : "thumb_down"
}},
color : { red : 0 , blue : 255 , green : 0 },
onClick : { action : {
function : "doDownvote"
}}
}]}}]
}
Send a message privately
Chat apps can send messages privately so that the
message is only visible to a specific user in the space. When a
Chat app sends a private message, the message
shows a label that notifies the user that the message is only visible to them.
To send a message privately using the Chat API, specify the
privateMessageViewer
field in the body of your request. To specify the user, you set the value to
the
User
resource that represents the Chat user. You can also use the
name
field of the User resource, as shown in the following example:
{
text : "Hello private world!" ,
privateMessageViewer : {
name : "users/ USER_ID "
}
}
To use this sample, replace USER_ID
with a unique ID for the user, such as 12345678987654321 or
hao@cymbalgroup.com . For more information about specifying users, see
Identify and specify Google Chat users .
To send a message privately, you must omit the following in your request:
Attachments
Send a text message on behalf of a user
This section explains how to send messages on behalf of a user using
user authentication .
With user authentication, the content of the message can only contain text
and must omit messaging features that are only available to
Chat apps, including card interfaces and interactive widgets.
In Developer Preview , you can
create messages with cards on behalf of a user. For details, see
Create and update cards .
Figure 3. A Chat app sends a text message on
behalf of a user.
To call the CreateMessage() method using user authentication, you must specify
the following fields in the request:
An authorization scope
that supports user authentication for this method. The following sample uses
the chat.messages.create scope.
The
Space
resource in which you want to post the message. The authenticated user must be
a member of the space.
The
Message
resource to create. To define the content of the message, you must include the
text
field.
Optionally, you can include the following:
The messageId field, which lets you
name the message to use in other API requests.
The thread.threadKey and messageReplyOption fields to
start or reply to a thread . If the space doesn't
use threading, this field is ignored.
The following code shows an example of how a Chat app
can send a text message in a given space on behalf of an authenticated user:

To run this sample, replace SPACE_NAME with the ID from
the space's
name
field. You can obtain the ID by calling the
ListSpaces()
method or from the space's URL.
Start or reply in a thread
For spaces that use threads ,
you can specify whether a new message starts a thread, or replies to
an existing thread.
By default, messages that you create using the Chat API start a new
thread. To help you identify the thread and reply to it later, you can specify a
thread key in your request:
In the body of your request, specify the
thread.threadKey
field.
Specify the query parameter
messageReplyOption
to determine what happens if the key already exists.
To create a message that replies to an existing thread:
In the body of your request, include the thread field. If set, you can
specify the
threadKey
that you created. Otherwise, you must use the
name
of the thread.
Specify the query parameter messageReplyOption .
The following code shows an example of how a Chat app
can send a text message that starts or replies to a given thread identified by
key of a given space on behalf of an authenticated user:

To run this sample, replace the following:
THREAD_KEY : an existing thread key in the space, or
to create a new thread, a unique name for the thread.
SPACE_NAME : the ID from the space's
name
field. You can obtain the ID by calling the
ListSpaces()
method or from the space's URL.
Name a message
To retrieve or specify a message in future API calls, you can name a message
by setting the messageId field in your request.
Naming your message lets you specify the message without needing to store the
system-assigned ID from the resource name of the message (represented in the
name
field).
For example, to retrieve a message using the get() method, you use the
resource name to specify which message to retrieve. The resource name is
formatted as spaces/{space}/messages/{message} , where {message} represents
the system-assigned ID or the custom name that you set when you created the
message.
To name a message, specify a custom ID in the
messageId
field when you create the message. The messageId field sets the value for the
clientAssignedMessageId
field of the Message resource.
You can only name a message when you create the message. You can't name or
modify a custom ID for existing messages. The custom ID must meet the following
requirements:
Begins with client- . For example, client-custom-name is a valid custom
ID, but custom-name is not.
Contains up to 63 characters and only lowercase letters, numbers, and
hyphens.
Is unique within a space. A Chat app can't use the
same custom ID for different messages.
The following code shows an example of how a Chat app
can send a text message with an ID to a given space on behalf of an
authenticated user:
Node.js
chat/client-libraries/cloud/create-message-user-cred-message-id.js

To run this sample, replace the following:

MESSAGE-ID : a name for the message that begins

Quote a message
You can quote another message by calling
CreateMessage()
( rpc ,

and setting quotedMessageMetadata
( rpc ,

in the request.
You can quote messages within a thread or in the main chat, but you can't quote
a message from a different thread.

QUOTED_MESSAGE_LAST_UPDATE_TIME : the last update time
of the message that you want to quote. If the message was never edited,
corresponds with createTime ( rpc , rest ). If the message was
edited, corresponds with lastUpdateTime ( rpc , rest ).
Troubleshoot
When a Google Chat app or
card returns an error, the
Chat interface surfaces a message saying "Something went wrong."
or "Unable to process your request." Sometimes the Chat UI
doesn't display any error message, but the Chat app or
card produces an unexpected result; for example, a card message might not
appear.
Although an error message might not display in the Chat UI,
descriptive error messages and log data are available to help you fix errors
when error logging for Chat apps is turned on. For help viewing,
debugging, and fixing errors, see
Troubleshoot and fix Google Chat errors .
