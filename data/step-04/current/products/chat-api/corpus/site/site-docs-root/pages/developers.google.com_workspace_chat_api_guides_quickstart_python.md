Page Summary
outlined_flag
This quickstart demonstrates how to create a Python command-line application that utilizes the Google Chat API to list available spaces.
Before running the sample, you'll need to set up your environment, which includes enabling the Google Chat API, configuring the OAuth consent screen, authorizing credentials, and configuring a Google Chat app.
The sample uses the Google client library for Python to handle authentication and interaction with the API; you'll need to install the necessary libraries using pip.
After configuring the sample code provided, you can run it to authenticate and make requests to the Google Chat API, such as listing spaces based on specified filters.
For production environments, it's recommended to learn more about authentication, authorization, and appropriate access credentials in the provided links before implementing your own applications.
Create a Python command-line application that makes requests to the
Google Chat API.
Quickstarts explain how to set up and run an app that calls a
Google Workspace API. This quickstart uses a
simplified authentication approach that is appropriate for a testing
environment. For a production environment, we recommend learning about
authentication and authorization
before
choosing the access credentials
that are appropriate for your app.
This quickstart uses Google Workspace's recommended API client libraries
to handle some details of the authentication and authorization flow.
Objectives
Set up your environment.
Install the client library.
Set up the sample.
Run the sample.
Prerequisites
To run this quickstart, you need the following prerequisites:
Python 3.10.7 or greater
The pip
package management tool
A Google Cloud project .
A Business or Enterprise Google Workspace account with access to Google Chat .
Set up your environment
To complete this quickstart, set up your environment.
Enable the API
Before using Google APIs, you need to turn them on in a Google Cloud project.
You can turn on one or more APIs in a single Google Cloud project.
In the Google Cloud console, enable the Google Chat API.
Enable the API
Configure the OAuth consent screen
If you're using a new Google Cloud project to complete this quickstart, configure
the OAuth consent screen. If you've already
completed this step for your Cloud project, skip to the next section.
In the Google API Console, go to Menu menu
> Google Auth platform
> Branding .
Go to Branding
If you have already configured the Google Auth platform, you can configure the following OAuth Consent Screen settings in Branding , Audience , and Data Access . If you see a message that says Google Auth platform not configured yet , click Get Started :
Under App Information , in App name , enter a name for the app.
In User support email , choose a support email address where users can contact you if they have questions about their consent.
Click Next .
Under Audience , select Internal .
Click Next .
Under Contact Information , enter an Email address where you can be notified about any changes to your project.
Click Next .
Under Finish , review the Google API Services User Data Policy and if you agree, select I agree to the Google API Services: User Data Policy .
Click Continue .
Click Create .
For now, you can skip adding scopes.
In the future, when you create an app for use outside of your
Google Workspace organization, you must change the User type to External . Then
add the authorization scopes that your app requires. To learn more, see the full
Configure OAuth consent guide.
Authorize credentials for a desktop application
To authenticate end users and access user data in your app, you need to
create one or more OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. A client ID is used to identify a
single app to Google's OAuth servers. If your app runs on multiple platforms,
you must create a separate client ID for each platform.
In the Google API Console, go to Menu menu
> Google Auth platform
> Clients .
Go to Clients
Click Create Client .
Click Application type > Desktop app .
In the Name field, type a name for the credential. This name is only shown in the Google API Console.
Click Create .
The newly created credential appears under "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs."
Save the downloaded JSON file as credentials.json , and move the
file to your working directory.
Configure the Google Chat app
To call the Google Chat API, you must configure a
Google Chat app. For any write requests, Google Chat
attributes the Google Chat app in the UI using
the following information.
In the Google API Console, go to the Chat API Configuration page:
Go to Chat API Configuration page
Under Application info , enter the following information:
In the App name field, enter Chat API quickstart app .
In the Avatar URL field, enter
https://developers.google.com/chat/images/quickstart-app-avatar.png .
In the Description field, enter Quickstart for calling the Chat API .
Under Interactive features , click the Enable interactive features
toggle to the off position to disable interactive features for the
Chat app.
Click Save .
Install the Google client library
Install the Google client library for Python:
python3 - m pip install -- upgrade google - apps - chat google - auth - httplib2 google - auth - oauthlib
Configure the sample
In your working directory, create a file named quickstart.py .
Include the following code in quickstart.py :
chat/quickstart/quickstart.py
View on GitHub
from __future__ import print_function
import os.path
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from google.apps import chat_v1 as google_chat
# If modifying these scopes, delete the file token.json.
SCOPES = [ 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.readonly' ]
def main ():
"""Shows basic usage of the Google Chat API.
"""
creds = None
# The file token.json stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is
# created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first
# time.
if os . path . exists ( 'token.json' ):
creds = Credentials . from_authorized_user_file ( 'token.json' , SCOPES )
# If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.
if not creds or not creds . valid :
if creds and creds . expired and creds . refresh_token :
creds . refresh ( Request ())
else :
flow = InstalledAppFlow . from_client_secrets_file (
'credentials.json' , SCOPES )
creds = flow . run_local_server ( port = 0 )
# Save the credentials for the next run
with open ( 'token.json' , 'w' ) as token :
token . write ( creds . to_json ())
try :
# Create a client
client = google_chat . ChatServiceClient (
credentials = creds ,
client_options = {
"scopes" : SCOPES
}
)
# Initialize request argument(s)
request = google_chat . ListSpacesRequest (
# Filter spaces by space type (SPACE or GROUP_CHAT or DIRECT_MESSAGE)
filter = 'space_type = "SPACE"'
)
# Make the request
page_result = client . list_spaces ( request )
# Handle the response. Iterating over page_result will yield results and
# resolve additional pages automatically.
for response in page_result :
print ( response )
except Exception as error :
# TODO(developer) - Handle errors from Chat API.
print ( f 'An error occurred: { error } ' )
if __name__ == '__main__' :
main ()
Run the sample
In your working directory, build and run the sample:
python3 quickstart . py
The first time you run the sample, it prompts you to authorize access:
If you're not already signed in to your Google Account, sign in when prompted. If
you're signed in to multiple accounts, select one account to use for authorization.
Click Accept .
Your Python application runs and calls the Google Chat API.
Authorization information is stored in the file system, so the next time you run the sample
code, you aren't prompted for authorization.
Next steps
Try the Google Workspace APIs in the APIs explorer
