To view your current Cloud Armor Enterprise enrollment tier, check
the cloudArmorTier value by using the
gcloud compute project-info describe command :
gcloud compute project-info describe
View the number of backend services and backend buckets covered by an enrollment
Each project that is enrolled in Cloud Armor Enterprise shows the number of
backend services and backend buckets covered on the Cloud Armor Enterprise
page. The number that you see is the total number of backend services and backend
buckets covered by the enrollment.
If the project is enrolled in Cloud Armor Enterprise Standard, which is the
default tier, this count isn't displayed.
Unsubscribe a billing account from Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual
A Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual subscription is a one-year commitment
that's renewed automatically. To prevent renewal at the end of the one-year
term, you must disable automatic renewal. After automatic renewal is disabled, your
current one-year subscription period continues to the end. At the end of the
subscription period, your Cloud Armor Enterprise subscription isn't renewed.
If your project has effective hierarchical security policies, your project is
downgraded to Cloud Armor Enterprise Paygo. Otherwise, all projects in the
billing account that are enrolled in Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual revert to
Cloud Armor Enterprise Standard.
To cancel Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual auto-renewal, follow these steps.
Console
When you are signed in to the subscribed billing account, in the
Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Armor Service Tier page.
Go to Cloud Armor Service Tier
Click Auto-Renew (off) . Your Cloud Armor Enterprise
subscription is not renewed when your current subscription expires. At that
time, projects enrolled in Cloud Armor Enterprise are no longer
enrolled. They still receive the DDoS protection provided in
Cloud Armor Enterprise Standard.
Open a DDoS response support case
To engage DDoS response support, you open a support case through the
Google Cloud console. For customers that meet the
eligibility requirements ,
your case is escalated to the Cloud Armor DDoS Response Team for
support, triage, and potential mitigation.
To open a DDoS response support case, see
Get support for a DDoS case .
Engage DDoS bill protection
To file a claim for DDoS Bill Protection, your project must be enrolled in
Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual, and you must prepare the following
information:
The billing account associated with the targeted project.
The project number of the project containing the targeted resource.
The internet-facing IP address of the targeted resource.
The time that the attack started.
The time that the attack concluded.
Normal traffic volumes for the impacted service.
Attack volumes for the impacted service.
You can initiate a chat or contact billing support through the Google Cloud console.
For more information on contacting Cloud Billing Support, see
How to contact Cloud Billing Support .
Cross-project referencing requirements
If you use
cross-project service referencing
and you want to take advantage of the Cloud Armor Enterprise pricing,
both the frontend and backend service projects must be enrolled in
Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual.
Qualified Attacks
For external passthrough Network Load Balancers, protocol forwarding, and public IP addresses
(VMs), an attack is considered a Qualified Attack (as described in the
Cloud Armor
terms and limitations )
only if advanced DDoS protection was already enabled for the region with the
attacked endpoint at the start of the attack.
Use Google Threat Intelligence
To use
Google Threat Intelligence , you
configure a security policy using the evaluateThreatIntelligence match
expression, providing a feed name based on the category that you want to
allow or block. If Google Threat Intelligence incorrectly blocks an
IP address, you can add the IP address to the exclusion list to allow traffic.
Troubleshooting Cloud Armor Enterprise
This section provides information to help you resolve any issues with
Cloud Armor Enterprise.
You subscribed to Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual, but your bill continues to be pay-as-you-go
If you subscribed to Cloud Armor Enterprise and you are still being
billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, check whether you enrolled your projects in
Cloud Armor Enterprise.
The Subscribe button is unavailable
If you are unable to subscribe to Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual because
the Subscribe button is unavailable, ensure that the user who is trying to
subscribe has the billing.accounts.update permission, which is required to
subscribe at the billing account level.
You unsubscribed from Google Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual, but were automatically enrolled in Paygo
If you unsubscribe your billing account from Google Cloud Armor Enterprise Annual
while your project has effective hierarchical security policies, your project is
downgraded to Cloud Armor Enterprise Paygo. This is because
hierarchical security policies require an active Google Cloud Armor Enterprise enrollment.
To unenroll from Paygo, you must first
delete your hierarchical security policies .
Your project was automatically enrolled to Cloud Armor Enterprise
Projects that are covered by a hierarchical security policy are automatically
enrolled to the highest Cloud Armor Enterprise tier for which they are
eligible. For more information, see
Google Cloud Armor Enterprise enrollment and billing behavior .
