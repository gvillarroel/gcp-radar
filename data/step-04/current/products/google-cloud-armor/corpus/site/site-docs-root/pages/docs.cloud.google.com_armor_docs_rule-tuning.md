Tune Cloud Armor preconfigured WAF rules
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: You can tune preconfigured WAF rules in hierarchical security policies that you own, but the
owners of services that inherit a hierarchical security policy can't perform
rule tuning.
Cloud Armor provides
preconfigured WAF rules , each consisting of
multiple signatures sourced from the
OWASP Core Rule
Set 4.22 CRS .
Each signature corresponds to an attack detection
rule in the ruleset. Incoming requests are evaluated against the preconfigured WAF rules.
A request matches a preconfigured WAF rule if the request matches any of the
signatures that are associated with the preconfigured WAF rule. A match is made when
the evaluatePreconfiguredWaf expression returns the value true .
Choose a sensitivity level
Each signature has a sensitivity level that corresponds to an OWASP
paranoia level .
You can select a sensitivity between 0 and 4 , though sensitivity level 0
means that no rules are enabled.
A lower sensitivity level indicates higher confidence signatures, which are less
likely to generate a false positive. By default, Cloud Armor is configured to run
at sensitivity level 4, and will evaluate all signatures in a rule set once
enabled. A higher sensitivity level increases security, but also increases the
risk of generating a false positive. When you select a sensitivity level for
your preconfigured WAF rule, you opt in signatures at the sensitivity levels less than or
equal to the selected sensitivity level. In the following example, you tune a
preconfigured WAF rule by selecting the sensitivity level of 1 :
Note: A false positive occurs when a preconfigured WAF rule incorrectly identifies a
legitimate query as a threat. This leads to a match, and the rule then
blocks the query.
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf(
'sqli-v422-stable',
{
'sensitivity': 1
}
)
Opt out rule signatures
If you decide that a preconfigured WAF rule matches more requests than is necessary,
or if the rule is blocking traffic that needs to be allowed, the rule can be
tuned to disable noisy or otherwise unnecessary signatures. To disable signatures
in a particular preconfigured WAF rule, you provide a list of IDs of the unwanted signatures
to the evaluatePreconfiguredWaf expression.
The following example excludes two CRS rule IDs from the preconfigured
sqli-v422-stable (CRS 4.22) WAF rule:
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf(
'sqli-v422-stable',
{
'sensitivity': 4,
'opt_out_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id942350-sqli', 'owasp-crs-v042200-id942360-sqli']
}
)
When you opt out signature IDs from preconfigured CRS rule sets, you must match
the signature ID version with the rule set version (CRS 3.0 or 3.3) to avoid
configuration errors.
You can also disable signature IDs by using the legacy expression
evaluatePreconfigureExpr . For more information about preconfigured WAF rule
expressions, see the
custom rules language reference .
Opt in rule signatures
Instead of opting out rule signatures, you can opt in rule signatures in
otherwise disabled sensitivity levels. We recommend that you opt in rule
signatures when there are fewer signatures that you want to use in a given
sensitivity level than there are rules that you want to opt out. To opt in rule
signatures, the sensitivity level must be 0 . The following example opts out
all cve-canary signatures at all sensitivity levels, and then explicitly opts
in owasp-crs-v042200-id044228-cve and owasp-crs-v042200-id144228-cve :
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf(
'cve-canary',
{
'sensitivity': 0,
'opt_in_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id044228-cve', 'owasp-crs-v042200-id144228-cve']
}
)
Exclude request fields from inspection
Your custom application might contain content in request fields (like
headers, cookies, query parameters, or URIs) that matches signatures in
preconfigured WAF rules, but which you know is legitimate. In this case, you can
reduce false positives by excluding those request fields from inspection by
associating a list of exclusions for request fields with the security policy
rule. Note that when you have a request field exclusion attached to a WAF rule,
you can't use the allow action.
When configuring a request field exclusion, you associate it with a target,
which can be an entire preconfigured WAF rule, or a list of signatures under a
preconfigured WAF rule. You can specify an exact match or a partial match by using a field
operator and a field value. The available field operators are as follows:
EQUALS : the operator matches if the field value equals the specified value.
STARTS_WITH : the operator matches if the field value starts with the specified value.
ENDS_WITH : the operator matches if the field value ends with the specified value.
CONTAINS : the operator matches if the field value contains the specified value.
EQUALS_ANY : the operator matches if the field value is any value.
Tuning exclusion limit
The default tuning exclusion limit is 100 for service-level backend policies
(both global and regional). This limit applies per target and controls the
maximum number of exclusions you can configure, within a security policy rule. A
target is the combination of a rule set and a rule ID. The limit applies to
exclusions for the following fields:
Request headers
Request cookies
Request query parameters
Request URIs
For example, if you have a preconfigured WAF rule (such as
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('sqli-v422-stable') ), and you want to exclude request
fields on a specific target (such as owasp-crs-v042200-id942100-sqli under
sqli-v422-stable ), you can configure up to 100 request headers, 100 request
cookies, 100 request query parameters, and 100 request URIs to be excluded for
that target.
The following sections provide more information about the request fields that
you can exclude from inspection, followed by examples.
Request headers
A list of request header names whose value is excluded from inspection during
preconfigured WAF rule evaluation.
The exclusion is only applicable for signatures in the target that
would inspect the request header value originally. This includes
signatures that are associated with the following request flag in
the OWASP Core Rule Set:
REQUEST_HEADERS
Only the value of the specified request headers are excluded from inspection.
The name is still inspected.
Request cookies
A list of request cookie names whose value is excluded from inspection during
preconfigured WAF rule evaluation.
The exclusion is only applicable for signatures in the target that would inspect
the request cookie value originally. This includes signatures that are
associated with the following request flag in
the OWASP Core Rule Set:
REQUEST_COOKIES
Only the value of the specified request cookies are excluded from inspection.
The name is still inspected.
Request query parameters
A list of request query parameter names whose value is excluded from inspection
during preconfigured WAF rule evaluation.
The exclusion is only applicable for signatures in the target that
would inspect the request parameters originally. This includes
signatures that are associated with the following request flags in
the OWASP Core Rule Set:
ARGS
ARGS_GET
REQUEST_URI
REQUEST_URI_RAW
REQUEST_LINE
Only the value of the specified query parameters are excluded from
inspection, which can be in the query string or the request body. The
name is still inspected.
Because query parameters are part of the URI and the request line,
these fields are re-assembled for inspection after excluding the
specified query parameters. However, for signatures that inspect the
entire request body (like signatures that are associated with the
request flag REQUEST_BODY ), the exclusion for query parameters isn't applied.
For example, if you exclude a query parameter named "args", you might still see
a match on a signature that inspects the entire request body if
the request has an "args" parameter in the request body and the value of
"args" matches.
Request URIs
A list of URIs from the request line excluding the query string data to be
excluded from inspection during preconfigured WAF rule evaluation.
The exclusion is only applicable for signatures in the target that
would inspect the request URI originally. This includes signatures
that are associated with the following request flags in the
OWASP Core Rule Set:
REQUEST_URI
REQUEST_URI_RAW
REQUEST_LINE
REQUEST_FILENAME
REQUEST_BASENAME
When excluding any of the preceding fields, the field is excluded
entirely from inspection, and no re-assembling is performed.
Field values
You must specify a field value if you use a field operator other than
EQUALS_ANY .
For request headers, request cookies, and request query parameters, the
permitted character set for field values includes the following characters:
! , # , $ , % , & , * , + , - , . , ^ , _ , ` , | , ~
Alpha characters A through Z (both lower and upper cases)
Digit characters 0 through 9
When applying exclusions for these request fields, the configured field values
are compared as they are against the values (case-insensitive, after
transformation) from the request. You are not expected to perform additional
encoding if you want to exclude a specific character that's not in the permitted
character set.
For request URIs, the field value must be given in a URI format as follows:
A scheme is allowed, but is restricted to http or https only.
A host is allowed, and can be an IP address.
A port is allowed.
A path is allowed.
A query isn't allowed.
A fragment isn't allowed.
When applying exclusions for request URIs, the configured field values are
compared as they are against the URIs (case-insensitive, after transformation)
from the request line, excluding the query string. The URIs from the
request line can be relative or absolute. Consider this when configuring
exclusions for request URIs.
Examples
The first example updates the rule in the security policy
POLICY_1 at PRIORITY to add an exclusion
configuration for all signatures under the sqli-v422-stable preconfigured WAF rule, to
exclude all request cookies from inspection:
gcloud compute security-policies rules add-preconfig-waf-exclusion PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_1 \
--target-rule-set "sqli-v422-stable" \
--request-cookie-to-exclude "op=EQUALS_ANY"
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the rule
POLICY_1 : the name of the security policy
The second example updates the rule in the security policy
POLICY_2 at PRIORITY to add an exclusion
configuration for signatures
owasp-crs-v042200-id941140-xss and owasp-crs-v042200-id941270-xss under the
xss-v422-stable preconfigured WAF rule, to exclude request headers that either start with
abc or end with xyz from inspection:
gcloud compute security-policies rules add-preconfig-waf-exclusion PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_2 \
--target-rule-set "xss-v422-stable" \
--target-rule-ids "owasp-crs-v042200-id941140-xss,owasp-crs-v042200-id941270-xss" \
--request-header-to-exclude "op=STARTS_WITH,val=abc" \
--request-header-to-exclude "op=ENDS_WITH,val=xyz"
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the rule
POLICY_2 : the name of the security policy
The third example updates the rule in the security policy
POLICY_3 at PRIORITY to add an exclusion
configuration for all signatures under the sqli-v422-stable preconfigured WAF rule. This
excludes request query parameters (parsed from the URI query string or the body
payload) that are equal to bad-param from inspection:
gcloud compute security-policies rules add-preconfig-waf-exclusion PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_3 \
--target-rule-set "sqli-v422-stable" \
--request-query-param-to-exclude "op=EQUALS,val=bad-param"
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the rule
POLICY_3 : the name of the security policy
The fourth example updates the rule in the security policy
POLICY_4 at PRIORITY to add an exclusion
configuration for sigature owasp-crs-v042200-id930100-lfi under the
lfi-v422-stable preconfigured WAF rule. This excludes request URIs that contain
/bad-path from inspection:
gcloud compute security-policies rules add-preconfig-waf-exclusion PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_4 \
--target-rule-set "lfi-v422-stable" \
--target-rule-ids "owasp-crs-v042200-id930100-lfi" \
--request-uri-to-exclude "op=CONTAINS,val=/bad-path"
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the rule
POLICY_4 : the name of the security policy
The fifth example updates the rule in the security policy
POLICY_5 at PRIORITY to remove all the
request field exclusions for the rule IDs owasp-crs-v042200-id942110-sqli and
owasp-crs-v042200-id942120-sqli under sqli-v422-stable .
gcloud compute security-policies rules remove-preconfig-waf-exclusion PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_5 \
--target-rule-set "sqli-v422-stable" \
--target-rule-ids "owasp-crs-v042200-id942110-sqli,owasp-crs-v042200-id942120-sqli"
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the rule
POLICY_5 : the name of the security policy
Apply parsing on custom Content-Type header values
When Cloud Armor evaluates the request body against preconfigured WAF rules, the
Content-Type header indicates the format of the data in the request body. By
default, Cloud Armor treats the contents of the request body as one
string, all of which is eligible for inspection and matching on your
preconfigured WAF rules. However, you can configure more precise parsing if your
incoming requests have a different encoding. Cloud Armor supports the
following encoding types:
JSON
GraphQL
