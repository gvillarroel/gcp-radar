Use these instructions to troubleshoot issues with Google Cloud Armor security
policies.
General issues
Debugging security policies
If you need additional information about what particular event triggers
preconfigured rules, read Using request logging ,
and then enable verbose logging. Cloud Logging records a higher level of
detail in your logs that you can use to analyze and debug your policies and
rules.
Traffic is allowed despite a deny rule configured in the Cloud Armor security policy
To fix this, follow these steps:
Make sure that the Cloud Armor security policy is attached to a
target backend service. For example, the following command describes all data
associated with the backend service BACKEND . The results
returned must include the name of the Cloud Armor security policy
associated with this backend service.
gcloud compute backend-services describe BACKEND
Replace BACKEND with the name of the backend service.
Review the HTTP(S) logs to determine which policy and rule were matched for
your traffic along with the associated action. To view the logs, use
Cloud Logging .
The following is a sample log of an allowed request with the interesting fields
highlighted. Check for the following fields and make sure that they match the
rule that you configured to deny the traffic:
configuredAction must match the action configured in the rule.
name must match the name of the Cloud Armor security policy
attached to this backend service.
outcome must match configuredAction .
priority must match the priority number of the rule.

FORWARDING_RULE_NAME : the name of the forwarding rule
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your project
TARGET_HTTP_PROXY_NAME : the name of the target HTTP proxy
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map
Review the hierarchy of rules to ensure that the correct rule is matched. It
is possible that a higher priority rule with an allow action is matching your
traffic. Use the describe command on the security-policies in the
Google Cloud CLI to see the contents of the Cloud Armor security
policy.
For example, the following example shows how a higher priority allow rule
(at priority 100) matches traffic coming from the 1.2.3.4 IP address, preventing
the lower priority deny rule (at priority 200) from triggering and blocking
the traffic.
gcloud compute security-policies describe POLICY_NAME
Replace POLICY_NAME with the name of the security
policy.
The output is similar to the following:

Preconfigured rule returns false positives
XSS and SQLi detection are based on static signature matching on
HTTP request headers and other Layer 7 parameters. These regular expression
patterns are prone to false positives. You can use the preconfigured rule for
XSS and SQLi detection in preview mode and then check the log for any false
positives.
If you find a false positive, you can compare the traffic content with the
OWASP CRS rules .
If you are migrating from an older CRS version, see the
WAF rules version comparison for a list of rule
changes and renames.
If the rule is invalid or not relevant, disable it by using the
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf expression, and specify the rule's ID in the
exclude ID list argument.
After reviewing the logs and removing all false positives, disable the preview
mode.
To add a preconfigured rule in preview mode:
Create a security policy with the preconfigured expression set in preview
mode:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000
--security-policy POLICY_NAME
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-stable')"
--action deny-403
--preview
Replace POLICY_NAME with the name of the security
policy.
Review the HTTP(S) logs for
HTTP request fields such as url and cookie . For example, the requestUrl
compares positively to the OWASP CRS rule ID 941180:
httpRequest:
remoteIp: 104.133.0.95
requestMethod: GET
requestSize: '801'
requestUrl: http://74.125.67.38/foo?document.cookie=1010"

Exclude the OWASP CRS rule ID 941180 by updating the rule in the
Cloud Armor security policy:
gcloud compute security-policies rules update 1000 \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable', ['owasp-crs-v042200-id941180-xss'])" \
--action deny-403 \
--preview
Replace POLICY_NAME with the name of the security
policy.
Review the logs again and then disable preview mode to implement the rule.
Clients with denied signatures aren't blocked or denied
If you are using Cloud Armor with Cloud CDN, security
policies are enforced only for requests for dynamic content, cache misses, or
other requests that are destined for the CDN origin server. Cache hits are
served even if the downstream Cloud Armor security policy can
prevent that request from reaching the CDN origin server.
Issues with named IP address lists
This section provides information for resolving problems with named IP address
lists.
IP addresses within a named IP address list
The IP addresses in the lists always match the IP addresses in the provider
websites listed in the
Cloud Armor named IP address lists guide. If you have questions about
the lists, contact the Cloud Support team .
IP addresses within a named IP address list are stale in Cloud Armor
Cloud Armor synchronizes its lists with IP address list providers
daily. It is possible to have stale data that lags a few hours or a day behind
the data at a provider. However, if you believe that the stale data lags more
than expected, for example, more than a week,
contact the Cloud Support team .
Difficulty creating a security policy that references a named IP address list
You might try to create a security policy that references a named IP address
list, using a command such as this:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 750 \
--security-policy my \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredExpr('sourceiplist-example')" \
--action "allow"
If the command fails, the error that you see looks something like this:
ERROR: (gcloud.compute.security-policies.rules.create) Could not fetch resource:
- Invalid value for field 'resource.match.expr': '{ "expression": "evaluatePreconfiguredExpr(\u0027sourceiplist-example\u0027)"}'.
Error parsing Cloud Armor rule matcher expression: sourceiplist-example
isn't a valid preconfigured expression set.
Make sure that the particular provider is supported, and that the name of the IP
address list is given correctly. You can check this by using the following
gcloud command to list the current preconfigured expression sets:
gcloud compute security-policies list-preconfigured-expression-sets
Traffic is blocked despite a preconfigured rule for a named IP address allowlist
You might find that traffic is blocked from an IP address that is on a named
IP address list:
Make sure that traffic is coming from an IP address that is on a
named IP address allowlist .
Check whether there are other security rules with a higher priority
that can block the traffic. If you still see the issue,
contact the Cloud Support team .
Make sure that the security policy is attached to the correct backend
service:
gcloud compute backend-services describe BACKEND_SERVICE
Check the rules that are in the security policy. For example:
gcloud compute security-policies describe POLICY_NAME
The command returns information similar to the following:
---
…
name: POLICY_NAME
rules:
-action: allow
description: allow fastly ip addresses
kind: compute#securityPolicyRule
match:
expr:
expression: evaluatePreconfiguredExpr('sourceiplist-fastly')
preview: false
priority: 100
-action: deny(403)
description: Default rule, higher priority overrides it
kind: compute#securityPolicyRule
match:
config:
srcIpRanges:
-'*'
versionedExpr: SRC_IPS_V1
preview: false
priority: 2147483647
-action: deny(404)
description: deny altostrat referer
kind: compute#securityPolicyRule
match:
expr:
expression: request.headers['Referer'].contains('altostrat')
preview: false
priority: 50
…
The preceding security policy contains three rules: a default deny rule, an
allow rule for
Fastly's IP addresses , and a deny
rule for a referrer that contains altostrat . Their respective
priorities are also listed.
Review the logs to determine which rule is matched to your traffic and
the associated action. For information about logging, see
Using the Logs Explorer .
The following is an example of a log:
httpRequest: {
referer: "http://www.altostrat.com/"
remoteIp: "23.230.32.10"
requestMethod: "HEAD"
requestSize: "79"
requestUrl: "http://www.example.com/"
responseSize: "258"
status: 404
userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0"
}
…
jsonPayload: {
@type: "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.loadbalancing.type.LoadBalancerLogEntry"
enforcedSecurityPolicy: {
configuredAction: "DENY"
name: " POLICY_NAME "
outcome: "DENY"
priority: 50
}
statusDetails: "denied_by_security_policy"
}
…
From the preceding log, the request is coming from 23.230.32.10 , which is
covered by Fastly's public IP address list .
However, the request is matched with a deny rule of a higher
priority of 50. Comparing this with what's in the security policy, the rule
corresponds to the deny rule for a referer that contains altostrat . Because the
request has a referer of http://www.altostrat.com/ , the security rule enforcement
is working correctly.
Issues with Security Command Center findings
This section contains information about issues with Security Command Center findings.
The Cloud Armor card does not appear in the Security Command Center
Enable Cloud Armor findings in the Security Command Center interface.
Findings from Cloud Armor don't appear in the Security Command Center
If findings from Cloud Armor don't appear in the Security Command Center,
traffic to the backend services might not meet the criteria for raising a
finding.
For questions about traffic volume to your backends, check request statistics in
the Cloud Monitoring dashboards under the Network Security
Policies .
Findings are too noisy
For assistance with this issue,
contact the Cloud Support team .
Issues with Google Cloud Armor Adaptive Protection
Use these instructions to help you resolve issues with Adaptive Protection.
Adaptive Protection is enabled for a security policy but there are no logs in Cloud Logging
Adaptive Protection logs are generated separately from Cloud Armor
request logs and appear under a different resource in Cloud Logging.
Adaptive Protection logs and events are under the Network Security
Policy resource in Cloud Logging. There is a training period of at least an
hour after Adaptive Protection is enabled in a security policy before
Adaptive Protection starts generating alerts for suspected attacks. During
the training period, Adaptive Protection learns from incoming request
traffic and develops distinct baselines for each backend service that is
protected by that security policy. Adaptive Protection is subsequently able
to identify suspicious activity.
If you enable Adaptive Protection for a security policy and you don't
observe any alerts after a one-hour training period, this suggests that there is
no activity that can be identified as potentially malicious targeting of any of
the backend services associated with that security policy.
If the potential attack or anomalous traffic persists for longer periods of
time, exceeding several hours, then Adaptive Protection starts to deem that
behavior as baseline behavior and does not continue to alert on similar traffic
patterns. After the potential attack subsides and traffic patterns go back to
the original baseline, either because the attack concluded or you blocked it
with the appropriate Cloud Armor rules, Adaptive Protection alerts
on future traffic behaviors that are considered departures from the baseline.
Adaptive Protection analyzes traffic that can otherwise be allowed through
a Cloud Armor security policy. If you set the default rule to deny
access with a restricted allowlist of traffic, then Adaptive Protection
only detects malicious activity on the traffic that passes evaluation with
respect to the allowlist.
There are too many alerts or too many logs in Cloud Logging from Adaptive Protection
An Adaptive Protection alert provides a confidence score, indicating how
strongly Adaptive Protection models identify the detected activity as
anomalous and potentially an attack. You can filter on the log's specific entry
through Cloud Logging to only surface (or forward to downstream) the
alerts that have a confidence score above a particular threshold.
Adaptive Protection provides a mechanism for reporting alerts as false
positives, which is described in the section Monitoring, feedback and reporting
event errors . Note that false positive reporting might not result in immediate
changes to what Adaptive Protection alerts on. Over time,
Adaptive Protection models learn that such traffic patterns are normal and
acceptable, and Adaptive Protection stops alerting on these patterns.
If Adaptive Protection alerts are too frequent on a subset of backend
services in a security policy, it might suggest that these backend services'
normal traffic has significant fluctuations that are constantly identified by
Adaptive Protection as anomalous behaviors. You can create a separate
security policy without Adaptive Protection enabled and associate these
backend services with the new security policy.
A particular incident reported by Adaptive Protection is considered a false positive or isn't relevant
Adaptive Protection provides a mechanism for reporting false positive alerts.
Follow the procedure described in the section
Monitoring, feedback and reporting event errors .
Note that false positive reporting might not result in immediate changes to what
Adaptive Protection alerts on. Over time, Adaptive Protection models
learn that such traffic patterns are normal and acceptable, and
Adaptive Protection stops alerting on these patterns.
How do I know that my edge security policies are being enforced?
You can check the actions taken on your edge security policies by checking the
monitoring dashboards, monitoring metrics, or per-request logging.
Monitoring dashboards
Cloud Monitoring is available on the Network Security Policies
page under Monitoring . You can use the breakdown by security policy on
the page to measure the number of requests allowed and denied by the
configured edge security policy. You can also examine the breakdown by backend
service to debug a particular backend service. For details about the
Cloud Monitoring dashboard, see
Monitoring Cloud Armor security policies .
Monitoring metrics
Raw metrics that measure the requests allowed and denied are available for edge
security policies. For more information, see
Monitoring metrics for security policies .
Per-request logging
The edge security policy decision is logged to the load balancing request logs
under enforcedEdgeSecurityPolicy . This is separate from the
enforcedSecurityPolicy , which captures the backend security policy decision.
Bot management
This section contains information about troubleshooting issues with bot
management.
Users aren't exempted as expected
You might have configured security policy rules with the redirect action for
reCAPTCHA assessment, and find that some users that you think are
legitimate were not exempted as expected. Follow the steps below for
troubleshooting.
First, check in the per-request logs to see whether there is a security policy
rule with a higher priority that matches the traffic, in which the action is
different. In particular, look for the configured_action and outcome fields.
Note that for a user to be exempted, at least two requests are involved. The
initial request comes without an exemption cookie, and the follow-on requests
come with an exemption cookie if the user passes the reCAPTCHA
assessment. Therefore, at least two log entries are expected.
If you see GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA as the configured action, and REDIRECT as the
outcome, the request was redirected for reCAPTCHA assessment;
If you see GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA as the configured action, and ACCEPT as the
outcome, the request was exempted from being redirected for
reCAPTCHA assessment.
If you see different values in the preceding fields, a rule with a different
action was matched. In that case, it is expected that the user isn't
redirected or exempted.
Second, there are several requirements on the user's side for them to be
exempted from being redirected for reCAPTCHA assessment.
The user must be using a browser.
The browser must enable JavaScript to allow proper loading of the redirect
page with reCAPTCHA JavaScript embedded.
The browser must enable cookies to allow the setting and auto-attaching of
the exemption cookie.
The user must pass reCAPTCHA assessment—for example, they
must resolve pop-up challenges if there are any.
Expect that users who cannot meet any of the preceding requirements don't
receive exemption, even if a rule with the redirect action for
reCAPTCHA assessment is matched.
Third, reCAPTCHA assessment is only executed when the redirect
page that embeds the reCAPTCHA JavaScript is rendered. For that
reason, redirecting for reCAPTCHA assessment is only applicable
for requests that expect a response leading to a full page render. Other
requests, such as assets loading within a page, or requests stemming from an
embedded script that don't expect the response to be rendered, aren't expected
to get reCAPTCHA assessment. As such, we recommend that you apply
this action with a match condition for URL paths that satisfy this condition.
For example, suppose that you have a webpage that contains embedded elements
like images, links to other webpages, and scripts. You don't want to apply the
redirect action for reCAPTCHA assessment for URL paths that host
images, or that are supposed to be accessed by scripts where a full page render
isn't expected. Instead, you can apply the redirect action for
reCAPTCHA assessment for URL paths that host webpages, like the
main webpage or other linked webpages.
Finally, if the redirect page is rendered successfully, check in the Developer
Tool provided by the browser to see whether an exemption cookie is set and
whether it is attached in the follow-on requests for the same site. For further
assistance, you can contact the Cloud Support
team.
Issues with rate limiting
Traffic isn't throttled as expected
You might find that a client IP address is sending high levels of traffic to an
application at a rate that exceeds the threshold you set, but the traffic is
not throttled as you expect. Follow these steps to investigate the issue.
First, confirm whether a higher-priority rule is allowing traffic from that IP
address. Examine the logs to see whether an ALLOW rule was triggered for the IP
address. This could be an ALLOW rule on its own, or in another THROTTLE or
RATE_BASED_BAN rule.
If you find a higher-priority rule, do one of the following:
Change the priorities to ensure that the rate-limiting rule has a higher
priority, by assigning it a lower numerical value.
Exclude the IP address from the matched expression in the rule that has a
higher priority.
The issue might also be that the threshold is set incorrectly. If this is the
case, the requests are matched accurately, but the conform action is triggered.
Examine the logs to confirm that this is the case, then reduce the threshold in
your rule.
Lastly, the IP address might not match the throttle or rate-based ban rule. To
fix this, check for a mistake in the match condition, then change the rule's
match condition to the correct value.
