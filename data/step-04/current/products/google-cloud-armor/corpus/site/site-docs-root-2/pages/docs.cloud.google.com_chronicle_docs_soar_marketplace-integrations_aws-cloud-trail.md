Integrate AWS CloudTrail with Google SecOps
This document explains how to integrate AWS CloudTrail with
Google Security Operations (Google SecOps).
Prerequisites
This integration requires you to configure the read-only access policy. For more
information about the policy, see
Granting custom permissions for CloudTrail
users
on the AWS documentation website.
Integration inputs
For detailed instructions on how to configure an integration in
Google SecOps, see Configure
integrations .
To configure the integration, use the following parameters:
Parameters
AWS Access Key ID
Required.
AWS Access Key ID to use in integration.
AWS Secret Key
Required.
AWS Secret Key to use in integration.
AWS Default Region
Required.
AWS default region to use in integration, such as
us-west-2 .
Note: You can make changes at a later stage, if needed. Once configured, the
instances can be used in playbooks. For detailed information on configuring and
supporting multiple instances, see
Supporting multiple instances .
Actions
You can run any integration action either automatically in a playbook or manually
from the Case View.
Ping
Test connectivity to AWS CloudTrail.
Entities
This action doesn't run on entities.
Action inputs
N/A
Action outputs
Action output type
Case wall attachment
N/A
Case wall link
N/A
Case wall table

Enrichment table
N/A
JSON result
N/A
Script result
Available
Script result
Script result name
Value
is_success
True/False
Case wall
The action provides the following output messages:
Output message
Message description
Successfully connected to the AWS CloudTrail server with the
provided connection parameters!
Action succeeded.
Failed to connect to the AWS CloudTrail server! Error is
ERROR_REASON
Action failed.
Check connection to the server,
input parameters, or credentials.
Connectors
To learn more about configuring connectors in Google SecOps,
see Ingest your data (connectors) .
Note: To prevent data loss, connectors utilize Event Flattening . If a raw alert
contains a list of entities (such as multiple email addresses, hostnames, or IP addresses),
connectors automatically flatten them into separate, unique events.
For example, a single raw alert containing three different email addresses is ingested as three
separate events, each containing one distinct email address.
This process ensures that every entity is correctly indexed as a unique asset, making it fully
searchable and actionable in playbooks.
AWS CloudTrail - Insights Connector
Pull insights from AWS CloudTrail.
Connector inputs
To configure the connector, use the following parameters:
Parameters
Product Field Name
Required.
Event Field Name
Required.
The name of the field that determines the event name (subtype).
Default value is CloudTrailEvent_insightDetails_insightType .
Environment Field Name
Optional.
The name of the field where the environment name is stored.
If the
environment field is missing, the connector uses the default value.
Environment Regex Pattern
Optional.
A regular expression pattern to run on the value found in the
Environment Field Name field. This parameter lets you manipulate
the environment field using the regular expression logic.
Use the default value .* to retrieve the required raw
Environment Field Name value.
If the regular expression pattern is null or empty, or the environment
value is null, the final environment result is the default environment.
Script Timeout (Seconds)
Required.
The timeout limit, in seconds, for the Python process that runs the
current script.
Default value is 180 seconds.
AWS Access Key ID
Required.
AWS Access Key ID to use in integration.
AWS Secret Key
Required.
AWS Secret Key to use in integration.
AWS Default Region
Required.
AWS default region to use in integration, such as us-west-2 .
Alert Severity
Required.
Severity level of the Google SecOps alerts created based
on the
insights.
Possible values are: Informational
Low
Medium
High
Critical
Default value is Medium .
Fetch Max Hours Backwards
Optional.
The number of hours before the first connector iteration to retrieve the
insights.
This parameter can apply to the initial connector iteration after you enable
the connector for the first time, or the fallback value for an expired connector
timestamp.
Default value is 1 hour.
Max Insights To Fetch
Optional.
Number of incidents to process per one connector iteration.
Max value is 50.
Default value is 50.
Use whitelist as a blacklist
Required.
If selected, the dynamic list is used as a blocklist.
Unchecked by default.
Verify SSL
Required.
If selected, the integration validates the SSL certificate when connecting to
the AWS CloudTrail server.
Not selected by default.
Proxy Server Address
Optional.
Address of the proxy server to use.
Proxy Username
Optional.
Proxy username to authenticate with.
Proxy Password
Optional.
Proxy password to authenticate with.
Connector rules
The connector supports proxy.
