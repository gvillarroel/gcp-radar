Migrate CBN alerts to YARA-L detection rule alerts
Caution: The Enterprise Insights page and CBN alerts are deprecated.
Use the Alerts and IOCs page to view alerts. We recommend that you
migrate the existing CBN alerts to the YARA-L detection engine as described in this guide.
Google Security Operations's YARA-L
detection engine is the preferred option for detection alerts because it offers
enhanced transparency in detection logic and robust tuning capabilities.
For more information see Overview of the YARA-L 2.0 .
This document provides details on how you can migrate Configuration Based Normalization (CBN)
alerts to YARA-L detection alerts. As a security analyst, with the help of this
document, you can continue getting notifications for alerts from third-party systems using the
Alerts and IOCs page.
Migrate CBN alerts to the YARA-L detection engine
To migrate CBN alerts, you can ensure that your prior CBN alerts are
available as detection rule alerts using the following options.
Use UDM search
Using the UDM search option, you can view events with the alert_state set in the parsers:
security_result.alert_state = "ALERTING"
From the UDM search results, you can explore the following fields to understand
which sources are generating CBN alerts in your environment:
Metadata > Vendor Name
Metadata > Product Name
Download default CBN alerts using the Tools API and manually review
The previous approach helps you to find alerts that have fired, but does not
cover the scenario of alerts that you have not seen before.
You can use the backstory.googleapis.com/v1/tools/cbn parsers method to download
default, select, or all CBNs, and manually review the parser logic applied to
find is_alert or alert_state based alerts.
You can port CBN alerts to YARA-L detection engine rule alerts which you actively
use.
Migrate Windows Defender antivirus alerts that were previously displayed in Enterprise Insights as CBN alerts
The following example shows how you can migrate Windows Defender antivirus alerts that were previously displayed in Enterprise Insights as CBN alerts.
Find an example alert using any one of the approaches explained previously.
Using the Raw Log / UDM Event viewer, copy select UDM fields that will provide reliable detection. See the following example.
metadata . vendor_name = "Microsoft"
metadata . product_name = "Windows Defender AV"
metadata . product_event_type = "MALWAREPROTECTION_STATE_MALWARE_DETECTED"
principal . asset . hostname = "client02.example.local"
security_result . action = "BLOCK"
security_result . severity = "MEDIUM"
Create a new YARA-L detection engine rule.
rule windows_defender_av_monitored_events {
meta :
author = "Chronicle"
description = "Migration of CBN alerts to Google SecOps YARA-L detection engine rule alert."
// Severity is set at the Outcome level via security_result.severity
severity = "INFORMATIONAL"
priority = "INFORMATIONAL"
events :
$ windows_defender_av . metadata . vendor_name = "Microsoft"
$ windows_defender_av . metadata . product_name = "Windows Defender AV"
$ windows_defender_av . metadata . product_event_type = "MALWAREPROTECTION_STATE_MALWARE_DETECTED"
$ windows_defender_av . principal . asset . hostname = $ host
// optionally tune to only detection on ALLOW, i.e., failure to BLOCK
//$windows_defender_av.security_result.action = "ALLOW"
// optionally tune on severity of detection
//$windows_defender_av.security_result.severity != "LOW"
outcome :
$ risk_score = max (
if ( $ windows_defender_av . security_result . severity = "UNKNOWN_SEVERITY" , 0 ) +
if ( $ windows_defender_av . security_result . severity = "LOW" , 25 ) +
if ( $ windows_defender_av . security_result . severity = "MEDIUM" , 50 ) +
if ( $ windows_defender_av . security_result . severity = "HIGH" , 75 ) +
if ( $ windows_defender_av . security_result . severity = "CRITICAL" , 100 )
)
$ severity = array_distinct ( $ windows_defender_av . security_result . severity )
condition :
$ windows_defender_av
}
CBN alert appears to use a field that was not parsed into UDM
Using the parser extensions option you can quickly address this scenario.
For example, Corelight CBN alert uses the notice field and conditionally alerts only if true:
if [ notice ] == "true" {
mutate {
replace = > {
"is_significant" = > "true"
"is_alert" = > "true"
}
}
}
Because this value isn't normalized into UDM by default you can use a parser
extension Grok as follows to add that value as a UDM field of type Additional :
filter {
mutate {
replace = > {
"notice" = > ""
}
}
grok {
match = > { "message" = > [ "(?P<message>\{.*\})$" ] }
on_error = > "_grok_not_syslog"
overwrite = > [ "message" ]
}
json {
on_error = > "not_json"
source = > "message"
array_function = > "split_columns"
}
if ! [ not_json ] {
if [ notice ] != "" {
mutate {
convert = > {
"notice" = > "string"
}
}
mutate {
replace = > {
"additional_notice.key" = > "notice"
"additional_notice.value.string_value" = > "%{notice}"
}
}
mutate {
merge = > {
"event1.idm.read_only_udm.additional.fields" = > "additional_notice"
}
}
mutate {
merge = > {
"@output" = > "event1"
}
}
}
}
}
You can then utilize this in a YARA-L detection engine rule as follows, and using the Maps function :
events :
// Corelight : Weird Log
(
$ corelight . metadata . vendor_name = "Corelight" and
$ corelight . metadata . product_name = "Zeek" and
// this requires a custom parser extension to extract notice
$ corelight . metadata . product_event_type = "weird" and
$ corelight . additional . fields [ "notice" ] = "true"
)
You must enable and turn on the authored rules for alerting. For more information, see Run rule live data .
