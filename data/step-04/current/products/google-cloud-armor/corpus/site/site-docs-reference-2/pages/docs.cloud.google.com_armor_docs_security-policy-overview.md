Security policy overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how you can use Google Cloud Armor security policies to protect
your Google Cloud deployments.
Google Cloud Armor security policies protect your application by providing Layer 7
filtering and by scrubbing incoming requests for common web attacks or other
Layer 7 attributes to potentially block traffic before it reaches your
load-balanced backend services or backend buckets. Each security policy is made
up of a set of rules that can be configured on attributes from Layer 3 through
Layer 7. The rules can filter traffic based on conditions such as an incoming
request's IP address, IP range, region code, or request headers.
Cloud Armor security policies are available for the following load
balancer and endpoint types:
All external Application Load Balancers, including classic Application Load Balancers
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Global external proxy Network Load Balancer (TCP/SSL)
Classic proxy Network Load Balancer (TCP/SSL)
External passthrough Network Load Balancer (TCP/UDP)
External protocol forwarding
VMs with external IPv4 addresses or external IPv6 address ranges assigned to
a network interface (NIC)
The load balancer can be in Premium Tier or Standard
Tier .
The backends to the backend service can be any of the following:
Instance groups
All network endpoint group (NEG) types
supported by your load balancer
Buckets in Cloud Storage
When you use Cloud Armor to protect a hybrid deployment or a multicloud
architecture, the backends must be internet NEGs or hybrid NEGs.
Cloud Armor also protects serverless NEGs when traffic is routed
through a load balancer. For information about how to route traffic through your
load balancer before it reaches your serverless NEG, see
Ingress controls .
Cloud Armor also provides advanced network DDoS protection for
external passthrough Network Load Balancers , protocol
forwarding , and VMs with public IP
addresses. For more information about advanced DDoS protection, see Configure
advanced network DDoS protection .
Protect your Google Cloud deployments with Cloud Armor security policies
External load balancing is implemented at the edge of Google's network in
Google's points of presence (PoPs) around the
world. In Premium Tier, user traffic directed to an external load
balancer enters
the PoP closest to the user. It is then load balanced over Google's global
network to the closest backend that has sufficient capacity available. In
Standard Tier, user traffic enters Google's network through peering, ISP, or
transit networks in the region where you have deployed your Google Cloud
resources.
Cloud Armor security policies enable you to allow, deny, rate-limit, or
redirect requests to your backend services at the Google Cloud edge, as
close as possible to the source of incoming traffic. This prevents unwelcome
traffic from consuming resources or entering your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
networks.
The following diagram shows the location of global external Application Load Balancers,
classic Application Load Balancers, the Google network, and Google data centers.

Requirements
These are the requirements for using Cloud Armor security policies:
The backend service's load balancing scheme must be EXTERNAL ,
EXTERNAL_MANAGED , or INTERNAL_MANAGED .
The backend service's protocol must be one of HTTP , HTTPS , HTTP/2 ,
UDP , TCP , SSL , or UNSPECIFIED .
About Cloud Armor security policies
Cloud Armor security policies are sets of rules that match on
attributes from Layer 3 to Layer 7 networks to protect externally facing applications or
services. Each rule is evaluated with respect to incoming traffic.
A Cloud Armor security policy rule consists of a match condition and
an action to take when that condition is met. For example, a condition can be
whether the incoming traffic's client IP address matches a specific IP address
or CIDR range (also known as IP address allowlist and denylist rules).
Alternatively, by using the
Cloud Armor custom rules language reference ,
you can create custom conditions that match on various attributes of the
incoming traffic, such as the URL path, request method, or request header values.
When an incoming request matches a condition in a security policy rule,
Cloud Armor allows, denies, or redirects the request, based on whether
the rule is an allow rule, a deny rule, or a redirect rule.
There can be additional action parameters to apply, like inserting request
headers; this feature is part of Cloud Armor bot management. For more
information about bot management, see the bot management
overview .
Cloud Armor provides two categories of security policies:
hierarchical security policies and service-level security policies. Hierarchical security policies
are attached at the organization, folder, or project level, while service-level
security policies are associated with one or more backend services. For more
information about hierarchical security policies, see
Hierarchical security policies overview .
A backend service can have two service-level security policies associated
with it at the same time, but it can't have two backend security policies or two
edge security policies at the same time. However, your backend services don't
all need to be associated with the same security policies. To attach and remove
security policies from supported backend services and features, see
Attach and remove security policies .
If a Cloud Armor security policy is associated with
any backend service, it can't be deleted. A backend service can be deleted
regardless of whether it has an associated security policy.
If multiple forwarding rules point to a backend service that has an associated
security policy, the policy rules are enforced for all traffic coming in to each
of the forwarding rule IP addresses.
In the following diagram, the Cloud Armor security policy
internal-users-policy is associated with the backend service test-network .
Cloud Armor security policy at network edge
(click to enlarge).
Cloud Armor security policies have the following features:
You can optionally use the QUIC protocol with load balancers that use
Cloud Armor.
You can use Cloud Armor with load balancers that are in either of
the following Network Service Tiers:
Premium Tier
Standard Tier
You can use backend security policies with GKE and the
default ingress controller.
You can use a default security policy that throttles traffic over a
user-specified threshold when you configure one of the following load
balancers:
Global external Application Load Balancer
Classic Application Load Balancer
Regional external Application Load Balancer
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Global external proxy Network Load Balancer (TCP/SSL)
Classic proxy Network Load Balancer (TCP/SSL)
In addition, you can configure Google Cloud Armor preconfigured WAF rules, which are complex
web application firewall (WAF) rules with dozens of signatures that are
compiled from open source industry standards. Each signature corresponds to an
attack detection rule in the rule set. Google offers these rules as is. The
rules allow Cloud Armor to evaluate dozens of distinct traffic
signatures by referring to conveniently named rules, rather than requiring you
to define each signature manually. For more information about preconfigured WAF rules, see
the preconfigured WAF rules overview .
Types of security policies
Caution: Hierarchical security policies support only some security policy types and
don't have the same features as service-level security policies. For more
information about which features hierarchical security policies support, see the
Hierarchical security policies
features table .
The following tables show the types of service-level security policies and what
you can do with them. A

Backend security policies
Backend security policies are used with backend services exposed by the
following load balancer types:
Global external Application Load Balancer
Classic Application Load Balancer
Regional external Application Load Balancer
Regional internal Application Load Balancer
Global external proxy Network Load Balancer
Classic proxy Network Load Balancer
You use backend security policies to filter requests and protect backend services that reference
instance groups or any of the supported NEG types behind the previously listed
load balancer types. For more information about the NEGs that your load balancer
supports, see the Network endpoint groups overview .
When using global external proxy Network Load Balancers or classic proxy Network Load Balancers,
Cloud Armor enforces the security policy rule deny action only on new
connection requests. The deny action terminates the TCP connection. In
addition, if you provide a status code with your deny action, the status code
is ignored.
Backend security policies have the optional type flag value CLOUD_ARMOR . If
you don't set the type flag, the default value is CLOUD_ARMOR .
Edge security policies
Edge security policies enable users to configure filtering and access control
policies for content that is stored in cache; this includes endpoints like
Cloud CDN-enabled backend services and Cloud Storage buckets. Edge
security policies support filtering based on a subset of parameters compared to
backend security policies. You cannot set an edge security policy as a backend
policy. Edge security policies are supported for the following endpoints:
Global external Application Load Balancer
Classic Application Load Balancer
Edge security policies can be configured to filter requests before the request
is served from Google's cache. Edge security policies are deployed and enforced
near the outermost perimeter of Google's network, upstream of where the
Cloud CDN cache resides. Edge security policies can coexist with backend
security policies to provide two layers of protection. They can be
simultaneously applied to a backend service regardless of the resources that the
backend service points to—for example, instance groups or network endpoint
groups. Only edge security policies can be applied to backend buckets.
When edge security policies and backend security policies are attached to the
same backend service, backend security policies are enforced only for cache miss
requests that have passed edge security policies.
Edge security policies are evaluated and enforced before
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP). A request blocked by an edge security policy is
denied before IAP evaluates the identity of the requestor.
Blocking a request with a rule at the edge security policy prevents
IAP from serving a sign-in page or otherwise attempting to
authenticate the user.
Edge security policies have the type flag value CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE .
Network edge security policies
Network edge security policies let you configure rules to block traffic at the
edge of Google's network. Enforcing network edge security policies doesn't
consume VM or host resources, which helps prevent high volume traffic from
exhausting resources on the target workload or otherwise causing a denial of
service. You can configure network edge security policies for the following
resources:
External passthrough Network Load Balancers
Protocol forwarding
VMs with public IP addresses
Network edge security policies support filtering based on some of the same
parameters as backend security policies, and are the only security policy type
to support byte offset
filtering . For a complete list
of available parameters, see the Types of security policies
table.
Network edge security policies have the type flag value CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK .
To configure network edge security policies, you must first configure advanced
network DDoS protection in the region in which you intend to create the
policies. For more information about advanced DDoS protection, see Configure
advanced network DDoS protection .
Internal service security policies
Internal service security policies let you configure fairshare rate limiting
with Cloud Service Mesh. Rather than attaching an internal service
security policy to a backend service or backend bucket, you attach it to a
Cloud Service Mesh endpoint policy. To learn more about internal service
security policies, see
Configure rate limiting with Cloud Armor
in the Cloud Service Mesh documentation.
Rule evaluation order
Rule evaluation order is determined by rule priority , from the lowest number
to the highest number. The rule with the lowest numeric value assigned has the
highest logical priority and is evaluated prior to rules with lower logical
priorities. The minimum numeric priority is 0. The priority of a rule decreases
as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N +1). You cannot configure two or more rules
with the same priority. The priority for each rule must be set to a number from
0 to 2147483646 inclusive. The priority value 2147483647, also known as
INT-MAX , is reserved for the default rule .
Priority numbers can have gaps. These gaps let you add or remove rules in the
future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9,
12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which you can add rules
numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future. You don't need to
change the existing rules except for the order of execution.
Typically, the highest priority rule that matches the request is applied.
However, there is an exception when requests with a body are
evaluated against preconfigured rules that use evaluatePreconfiguredWaf . The exception is as
follows:
For requests containing bodies, Cloud Armor receives the request's header
before the body (payload). Because Cloud Armor receives the header
information first, it evaluates rules that match against the header, but it
doesn't match any preconfigured rules on the body. If there are multiple
header-based rules, Cloud Armor evaluates them based on their priority
as expected. Note that redirect actions and inserting custom header actions
work only during the header processing phase. The redirect action, if matched
during the following body processing phase, is translated to a deny action.
The custom request header action, if matched during the body processing phase,
doesn't take effect.
After Cloud Armor receives the request body, it evaluates rules that
apply to both the request headers and body. As a result, it's possible that
lower priority rules that allow a request's header are matched before higher
priority rules that block the request's body. In such cases, it is possible that
the HTTP header portion of the request is sent to the target backend service,
but the body containing potentially malicious content is blocked.
Cloud Armor inspects up to the first 64 kB of the request body,
according to the configured inspection limit .
The evaluatePreconfiguredWaf() expression for preconfigured rules is the only
expression that is evaluated against the request body. All other expressions are
evaluated only against the request header. The body inspection is limited to the
configured inspection limit of the request body. By default,
the body is decoded like URL query parameters. Cloud Armor
also supports parsing JSON-formatted bodies ( Content-Type =
"application/json" ). However, Cloud Armor doesn't support other HTTP
Content-Type/Content-Encoding-based decoders such as XML, Gzip, or UTF-16. For
other content types and encoding types, including multipart/form-data,
Cloud Armor doesn't decode the data, but applies the preconfigured
rules to raw data.
Examples
In the following example, rules 1, 2, and 3 are evaluated in that order for the
IP and HTTP header fields. However, if an IP address 9.9.9.1 launches an XSS
attack in the body, only the body is blocked (by rule 2); the HTTP
header passes through to the backend (by rule 3).
Rule1
expr: inIPRange(origin.ip, '10.10.10.0/24')
action: deny(403)
priority: 1
Rule2
expr: evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable')
action: deny(403)
priority: 2
Rule3
expr: inIPRange(origin.ip, '9.9.9.0/24')
action: allow
priority: 3
Rule-default
action: deny(403)
priority: INT-MAX
In the following example, the policy allows IP 9.9.9.1 without scanning
against XSS attacks:
Rule1
expr: inIPRange(origin.ip, '10.10.10.0/24')
action: deny(403)
priority: 1
Rule2
expr: inIPRange(origin.ip, '9.9.9.0/24')
action: allow
priority: 2
Rule3
expr: evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable')
action: deny(403)
priority: 3
Rule-default
action: allow
priority: INT-MAX
Default rule
Each Cloud Armor security policy contains a default rule that is
matched if none of the higher priority rules are matched or if there are no
other rules in the policy. The default rule is automatically assigned a priority
of 2147483647 ( INT-MAX ), and it is always present in the security policy.
You can't delete the default rule, but you can modify it. The default action
for the default rule is deny , but you can change the action to allow .
Fingerprint
Each Cloud Armor security policy has a field fingerprint . The
fingerprint is a hash of the contents stored in the policy. When you create a
new policy, don't provide the value of this field. If you provide a value, it is
ignored. However, when you update a security policy, you must specify the
current fingerprint, which you get when you export or describe the policy (using
EXPORT or DESCRIBE , respectively).
The fingerprint protects you from overriding another user's update. If the
fingerprint that you provide is out of date, it means that the security policy
was updated since you last retrieved the fingerprint. To check for any
differences and to retrieve the latest fingerprint, run the DESCRIBE command.
Rules language and enforcement engine
The rules language and enforcement engine provide the following:
The ability to write custom rule expressions that can match on various Layer
3 through Layer 7 attributes of incoming requests. Cloud Armor
provides a custom rules language
attributes for writing custom match
conditions.
The ability to combine up to 5 subexpressions in a single rule.
The ability to deny or allow requests based on the incoming request's region
code. The region codes are based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha
2
codes. The region codes sometimes correspond to specific countries, but some
encompass a country plus its associated areas. For example, the US code
includes all states of the United States, one district, and six outlying
areas.
Types of rules
Cloud Armor has the following types of rules.
Note: Edge security policies support filtering based on only origin.asn ,
origin.ip , origin.region_code ,
request.headers , request.method , request.path , request.query , and
request.scheme .
IP address allowlist and denylist rules
You can create IP address allowlist and denylist rules within a security policy.
Some examples include the following:
Adding an IP address or CIDR
range to a denylist lets you block a client IP address or CIDR range
from accessing supported load balancers.
Adding an IP address or CIDR range to an allowlist lets you allow a client
IP address or CIDR range to access supported load balancers.
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported in allowlist and denylist rules.
Deny rules can return an HTTP 403 Unauthorized , 404 Access Denied ,
or 502 Bad Gateway status code.
Exceed action rules can return an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status code.
Client geography rules
You can allow or deny requests that originated from selected geographical areas
that are defined by the Unicode country code.
Cloud Armor uses our own IP geolocation database to identify the
request geography location. The database is updated regularly. While we can't
guarantee a particular update cadence, during normal operations the mappings
that Cloud Armor uses are updated about once per week.
Updated mappings must be propagated to Google's infrastructure globally. The
rollout process happens gradually, usually over several days, across multiple
zones and regions that Cloud Armor is deployed on. Because of this
gradual rollout process, it's possible to see requests from the same client IP
address being handled inconsistently during a rollout when the geolocation
mapping for the client IP address has changed.
Preconfigured WAF rules
Cloud Armor provides a comprehensive list of preconfigured WAF rules
based on the OWASP Core Rule Set
(CRS)
to help you detect the following:
SQL injection attacks
Cross-site scripting attacks
Local file inclusion attacks
Remote file inclusion attacks
Remote code execution attacks
Method enforcement attacks
Scanner detection attacks
Protocol attacks
PHP injection attacks
Session fixation attacks
Java attacks
NodeJS attacks
For details, see the Cloud Armor preconfigured WAF rules
overview .
Bot management rules
You can use bot management rules to do the following:
Redirect requests for reCAPTCHA assessment with optional
manual challenges.
Evaluate reCAPTCHA tokens attached with a request and apply
the configured action based on token attributes.
Redirect requests to your configured alternative URL with a 302 status
code.
Insert custom headers to requests before proxying them to your backends.
For more information about bot management, see the bot management
overview .
Preconfigured rules for named IP address lists
Preconfigured rules for named IP address lists provide the following:
Integrate third-party providers' named IP address lists with
Cloud Armor.
Simplify maintenance of allowed or denied IP address ranges.
Synchronize third-party providers' lists daily.
Increase your capacity for configuring IP addresses and ranges in security
policies because named IP address lists aren't subject to limits on the
number of IP addresses per rule.
Rate limiting rules
You can use rate limiting rules to do the following:
Throttle requests per client based on a threshold you configure.
Temporarily ban clients that exceed a request threshold that you set for a
configured duration.
When you use rate limiting with global external proxy Network Load Balancers or
classic proxy Network Load Balancers, the following restrictions apply:
Cloud Armor only enforces rate limiting actions like throttling or
banning on new connection requests from clients.
Only the key types ALL and IP are supported.
If you attempt to use the key type HTTP-HEADER or HTTP-COOKIE with
TCP/SSL load balancers, the key type is interpreted as ALL , and likewise
XFF-IP is interpreted as IP .
For more information about rate limiting and how it works, see the
Rate limiting overview .
Preview mode
You can preview the effects of a rule without enforcing it. In preview mode,
actions are noted in Cloud Monitoring . You can choose to
preview individual rules in a security policy, or you can preview every rule in
the policy. You are charged the normal per-request fee for rules in preview
mode.
You can enable preview mode for a rule by using the Google Cloud CLI and the
--preview flag of the gcloud compute security-policies rules update command .
To disable preview mode, use the --no-preview flag. You can also use the
Google Cloud console.
If a request triggers a preview, Cloud Armor continues to evaluate
other rules until finding a match. Both the matched and preview rule are
available in the logs.
Custom error responses
When you use a global external Application Load Balancer, you can configure custom error responses
for HTTP status codes for errors that load balancers or backend instances
generate. In addition, you can configure custom error codes for traffic that
Cloud Armor denies by configuring custom response pages for the same
4 xx series or 5 xx series status codes
that your existing security policy rules use.
For more information about custom error responses, see the Custom error response overview . For
configuration steps, see Configure custom error responses .
Logging
Cloud Armor has extensive logging and lets you define how verbose your
logging is. Cloud Armor logs are generated based on the first (highest
priority) rule that matches an incoming request, whether or not the security
policy is in preview mode. This means that logs aren't generated for
non-matching rules, nor for matching rules at lower priorities.
For complete information about logging, see Use request
logging . For more information about verbose
logging, see Verbose logging . To view
Cloud Armor logs, see Viewing
logs .
External Application Load Balancer request logging
Each HTTP(S) request that is evaluated against a Cloud Armor security
policy is logged through Cloud Logging. The logs provide details such as the
name of the applied security policy, the matching rule, and whether the rule was
enforced. Request logging for new backend service resources is disabled by
default. To log Cloud Armor requests, you must enable HTTP(S) logging
for each backend service protected by a security policy.
For more information, see External Application Load Balancer logging and monitoring .
External proxy Network Load Balancer request logging
You can configure logging for external proxy Network Load Balancers by using the Google Cloud CLI
commands as listed in TCP/SSL proxy load balancing logging and monitoring . You
cannot enable logging for external proxy Network Load Balancers using the Google Cloud console.
Limitations
The following sections detail limitations for security policies.
Request body inspection limitation
The evaluatePreconfiguredWaf expression for preconfigured rules is the only
expression that Cloud Armor evaluates against the request body. Among
the HTTP request types with a request body, Cloud Armor processes only
requests with a body.
The inspection is limited to the configured inspection limit of
the request body.
The remainder of the request body might contain payloads that would match a WAF
rule signature, which your application might accept. To mitigate the risk of
request bodies whose size exceeds the configured inspection
limit , see Mitigate risk on request body that exceeds
configured inspection limit .
Cloud Armor can parse and apply preconfigured WAF rules for
default URL-encoded and JSON-formatted request bodies
( Content-Type = "application/json" ), in which case rules are
independently applied on the decoded names and values in the data.
For other content types and encoding types, Cloud Armor
doesn't decode the data, but applies the preconfigured rules on
raw data.
How WebSocket connections are handled
Global external Application Load Balancers have built-in support for the WebSocket protocol.
WebSocket channels are initiated from HTTP(S) requests. Cloud Armor
can block a WebSocket channel from being established, for example, if an IP
address denylist blocks the client's IP address. However, subsequent
transactions in the channel don't conform to the HTTP protocol, and
Cloud Armor doesn't evaluate any messages after the first request.
How gRPC connections are handled
Global external Application Load Balancers have built-in support for the gRPC protocol. gRPC is an
open-source framework that uses HTTP/2 as its underlying protocol. gRPC calls are
initiated from HTTP(S) POST requests. You can configure Cloud Armor to
block gRPC calls from being established, for example, by using an IP address
denylist that blocks the client's IP address. However, you might see that the
load balancer still reports 200 OK HTTP status code responses in its logs and
metrics. This doesn't mean that Cloud Armor isn't working as
intended.
