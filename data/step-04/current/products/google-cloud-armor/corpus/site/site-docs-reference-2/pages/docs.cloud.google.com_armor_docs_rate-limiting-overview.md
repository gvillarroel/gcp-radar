Rate limiting overview

Google Cloud Armor provides capabilities to help protect your Google Cloud applications
against a variety of Layer 3 and Layer 7 attacks. Rate-based rules help you
protect your applications from a large volume of requests that flood your
instances and block access for legitimate users.
Rate limiting can do the following:
Prevent any particular client from exhausting application resources.
Protect your application instances from erratic and unpredictable spikes
in the rate of client requests.
In addition, when a resource is presented with a high volume of traffic from a
small number of clients, you can prevent your other clients from being affected
by large spikes of traffic from that small number of clients, enabling your
resources to handle as many requests as possible.
Cloud Armor has two types of rate-based rules:
Throttle . You can enforce a maximum request limit per client or across all
clients by throttling individual clients to a user-configured threshold.
Rate-based ban . You can rate limit requests that match a rule on a per-client
basis and then temporarily ban those clients for a configured period of time
if they exceed a user-configured threshold.
When you configure a rule with a rate-based ban action, you can't change it to a
throttle action later. However, when you configure a rule with a throttle action,
you can change it to a rate-based ban action later. For more information, see
Change a throttle rule to a rate-based ban rule .
Cloud Armor applies the rate limiting threshold to each associated
backend. For example, if you have two backend services and you configure a rate
limiting rule with a threshold of 1,000 requests per minute, then each backend
service can receive 1,000 requests per minute before Cloud Armor
applies the rule action.
You can preview the effects of rate limiting rules in a security policy by
using preview mode and examining your request logs.
Identifying clients for rate limiting
Cloud Armor identifies individual clients for rate limiting by using
the following key types for aggregating requests and enforcing rate limits:
ALL : a single key for all requests that satisfy the rule match condition.
IP : a unique key for each client IP address whose requests
satisfy the rule match condition.
HTTP_HEADER : a unique key for each unique HTTP header value whose name is
configured. The key value is truncated to the first 128 bytes of the header
value. The key type defaults to ALL if no such header is present, or if you
attempt to use this key type with an external proxy Network Load Balancer.
XFF_IP : a unique key for each original client IP address,
that is, the first IP address in the list of IPs specified in the
X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. The key type defaults to IP address if no
such header is present, if the value is not a valid IP address, or if you
attempt to use this key type with an external proxy Network Load Balancer.
HTTP_COOKIE : a unique key for each HTTP cookie value whose name is
configured. The key value is truncated to the first 128 bytes of the cookie
value. The key type defaults to ALL if no such cookie is present, or if you
attempt to use this key type with an external proxy Network Load Balancer.
HTTP_PATH : the URL path of the HTTP request. The key value is truncated to
the first 128 bytes.
SNI : the server name indication in the TLS session of the HTTPS request.
The key value is truncated to the first 128 bytes. The key type
defaults to ALL on an HTTP session.
REGION_CODE : the country or region from which the request originates.
TLS_JA4_FINGERPRINT : JA4 TLS/SSL fingerprint if the client connects using
HTTPS , HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 . If not available, the key type defaults to
ALL. For more information about JA4, see the
rules language reference .
TLS_JA3_FINGERPRINT : JA3 TLS/SSL fingerprint if the client connects using
HTTPS , HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 . If not available, the key type defaults to
ALL.
USER_IP : The IP address of the originating client, included in the headers
configured under userIpRequestHeaders and whose value is filled by an
upstream proxy. If there is no userIpRequestHeaders configuration, or an IP
address cannot be resolved from it, the key type defaults to IP. For more
information, see the
rules language reference .
You can use the preceding keys individually, or you can apply rate limiting
based on a combination of up to three keys. You can use multiple HTTP-HEADER
or HTTP-COOKIE keys, and only one of each other key type. For more
information, see
Rate limiting based on multiple keys .
Note: The rate-limiting key data is classified as service data, which is
processed as described in Google Cloud Privacy Notice .
Rate-limiting key data isn't treated as
customer data .
If your workload is subject to regulatory regimes or other compliance
requirements that necessitate access transparency or access approval ,
review the key types whose values might contain sensitive information.
Choose between rate based ban and throttle rate limiting rules
Cloud Armor rate-based ban and throttle rate limiting rules differ
in how they handle traffic exceeding the configured threshold.
rate_based_ban : when the rate of requests exceeds the defined threshold,
Cloud Armor blocks all further requests from the source or target
of those requests for a specified period.
throttle : instead of blocking all traffic, throttling limits the rate of
requests to a defined maximum. Throttling allows some traffic to pass through,
but at a controlled rate that prevents overload.
The most appropriate rule depends on your specific needs and the type of traffic
you're dealing with. For example, if you're facing a DDoS attack, a rate-based
ban might be more appropriate to quickly block the malicious traffic.
Alternatively, if you're experiencing a sudden surge in legitimate traffic,
throttling might be a better option to maintain service availability while
preventing overload.
Throttling traffic
The throttle action in a rule lets you enforce a per-client request
threshold to protect backend services. This rule enforces the threshold to limit
traffic from each client that satisfies the match conditions in the rule. The
threshold is configured as a specified number of requests in a specified time
interval.
For example, you might set the request threshold to 2,000 requests within 1,200
seconds (20 minutes). If a client sends 2,500 requests within any 1,200 second
period, approximately 20% of the client's traffic is throttled until the
permitted request volume is at or below the configured threshold.
When a client's traffic rate is under or equal to the
rate_limit_threshold_count , requests follow the conform_action , which is
always an allow action. The request is allowed through the security policy
and permitted to reach its destination. When a client's traffic rate exceeds
the specified rate_limit_threshold_count , Cloud Armor applies the
exceed_action , which can be either deny or redirect , for requests over
the limit for the rest of the threshold interval.
You set these parameters to control the action:
rate_limit_threshold_count : the number of requests per client allowed within a
specified time interval. The minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is
1,000,000.
interval_sec : the number of seconds in the time interval. The value must be
10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1800, 2700, or 3600 seconds.
exceed_action : when a request exceeds the rate_limit_threshold_count ,
Cloud Armor applies the configured exceed_action . Possible values
for the exceed_action follow:
deny(status) : the request is denied and the specified status code is
returned. Valid values are 403 Forbidden , 404 Page Not Found ,
429 Too Many Requests , and 502 Bad Gateway . We recommend
using the 429 Too Many Requests status code.
redirect : the request is either redirected for reCAPTCHA
assessment or to a different URL, based on the exceed_redirect_options
parameter.
exceed_redirect_options : when the exceed_action is redirect , use this
parameter to specify the redirect action:
type : type for the redirect action, either GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA or
EXTERNAL_302 .
target : URL target for the redirect action. Only applicable when the
type is EXTERNAL_302 .
conform_action : the action performed when the number of requests is
under the rate_limit_threshold_count . This action is always an
allow action.
Banning clients based on request rates
The rate_based_ban action in a rule lets you enforce a per-client
threshold to temporarily ban clients that exceed the limit by applying the
configured exceed_action for all requests from the client for a configurable
time period. The threshold is configured as a specified number of requests in a
specified time interval. You can temporarily ban traffic for a
user-configured time period ( 'ban_duration_sec' ), provided that the traffic
matches the specified match condition and exceeds the configured threshold.
For example, you might set the request threshold to 2,000 requests within 1,200
seconds (20 minutes). If a client sends 2,500 requests within any 1,200 seconds,
Cloud Armor applies the exceed_action to traffic from that client
exceeding the 2,000 request threshold until the full 1,200 seconds has elapsed
and for an additional number of seconds that you set as the ban duration period.
If the ban duration period is set to 3600 , for example, traffic from the
client would be banned for 3,600 seconds (one hour) beyond the end of the
threshold interval.
When a client's request rate is under the rate limit threshold, the request can
immediately proceed to the backend service. When a client's traffic
rate exceeds the specified rate_limit_threshold_count , Cloud Armor
applies the exceed_action to all incoming requests from the client for the
rest of the threshold interval and for the next ban_duration_sec seconds,
whether or not the threshold is exceeded.
With this configuration, it is possible to accidentally ban welcome clients that
only occasionally exceed the allowable request rate. To prevent this, and ban
only clients that frequently exceed the request rate, you can
optionally track the total client requests against an additional, preferably
longer, threshold configuration called the ban_threshold_count . In this mode,
the client is banned for the configured ban_duration_sec only if the
request rate crosses the configured ban_threshold_count . If the request rate
doesn't exceed the ban_threshold_count , the requests keep getting throttled
to rate_limit_threshold_count . For the purpose of ban_threshold_count , the total
requests from the client, consisting of all incoming requests before throttling,
are counted.
These parameters control the action of a rate_based_ban rule:
rate_limit_threshold_count : the number of requests per client allowed within
a specified time interval. The minimum value is 1 request and the maximum
value is 10,000 requests.
interval_sec : the number of seconds in the time interval. The value must
be 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1800, 2700, or 3600
seconds.
exceed_action : when a request exceeds the rate_limit_threshold_count ,
Cloud Armor applies the configured exceed_action . Possible values
for the exceed_action are as follows:
deny(status) : the request is denied and the specified status code is
returned. Valid values are 403 Forbidden , 404 Page Not Found ,
429 Too Many Requests , and 502 Bad Gateway . We recommend using the
status code 429 Too Many Requests .
redirect : the request is either redirected for reCAPTCHA
assessment or to a different URL, based on the exceed_redirect_options
parameter.
exceed_redirect_options : when the exceed_action is redirect , use this
parameter to specify the redirect action:
type : the type for the redirect action, either GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA or
EXTERNAL_302 .
target : the URL target for the redirect action. This URL target is only
applicable when the type is EXTERNAL_302 .
conform_action : the action performed when the number of requests is
under the rate_limit_threshold_count . This action is always an allow
action.
ban_threshold_count : the number of requests per client allowed
within a specified time interval, over which Cloud Armor bans
requests. If specified, the key is banned for the configured
ban_duration_sec when the number of requests that exceed the
rate_limit_threshold_count also exceed this ban_threshold_count .
ban_threshold_interval_sec : the number of seconds in the time interval for
your ban_threshold_count . The ban_threshold_interval_sec value must be
10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1800, 2700, or 3600 seconds.
ban_duration_sec : the additional number of seconds for which a
client is banned after the interval_sec period elapses. The
ban_duration_sec value must be 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 600, 900, 1200,
1800, 2700, or 3600 seconds.
Default rate limiting security policy
When you configure a
default security policy during
load balancer creation, the default threshold is 500 requests during each
one-minute interval (a rate_limit_threshold_count and interval_sec of 500
and 60 , respectively). If you want to select a different threshold, we
recommend that you use the following steps to tune your parameters:
Enable Cloud Logging and query the maximum
number of requests that arrived per IP address and per minute over a day or
longer at your Cloud Armor-protected backend service.
For example, suppose that you believe that 99% of the network traffic that
you receive isn't impacted by the rate limit rule. In this scenario,
we recommend that you set your rate limit threshold to the 99th percentile of
the maximum number of requests per IP address and per minute of the
distribution that is generated from the Cloud Logging data.
If you still notice default rate limit rules blocking legitimate traffic,
consider the following additional steps:
Enable caching (Cloud CDN or Media CDN).
Increase throttle time interval (requests received per several
minutes, instead of per 60 seconds).
You can ban clients to reduce attack impact further after the initial
wave. The Cloud Armor rate_based_ban action lets you ban all
clients that exceed the limits too many times within a
user-specified window. For example, clients that exceed the
limits 10 times within a minute can be banned for 15 minutes.
Threshold enforcement
The configured thresholds for throttling and rate-based bans are enforced
independently in each of the Google Cloud regions where your HTTP(S)
backend services are deployed. For example, if your service is deployed in two
regions, each of the two regions applies the configured rate limit threshold to
each key, so your backend service might experience cross-region aggregated
traffic volumes that are twice the configured threshold. If the configured
threshold is set to 5,000 requests, the backend service might receive 5,000
requests from one region and 5,000 requests from the second region.
However, for the key type IP address, it is reasonable to assume that traffic
from the same client IP address is directed to the region that is closest to the
region where your backends are deployed. In this case, rate limiting
can be considered to be enforced at a backend service level, regardless of the
regions in which it is deployed.
It is important to note that the enforced rate limits are approximate and might
not be strictly accurate compared to the configured thresholds. Also, in rare
cases, because of internal routing behavior, it is possible that rate limiting
might be enforced in more regions than the regions you are deployed in, thus
impacting accuracy. For these reasons, we recommend that you use rate limiting
only for abuse mitigation or maintaining application and service availability,
not for enforcing strict quota or licensing requirements.
Rate limiting based on REGION_CODE considers the region where the request
originates from and doesn't consider the region of the backends in the
backend service, regardless of their type. Backends include instance groups,
any type of network endpoint group (NEG) supported by the load balancers, and
Cloud Storage buckets. Supported backends can be found in
Security policy overview .
Logging
Cloud Logging records the security policy name, matched rate limit rule
priority, rule ID, the associated action, and other information in your request
logs. For more information about logging, see
Use request logging .
Integration with reCAPTCHA
You can apply rate limiting to some reCAPTCHA resources in order to
mitigate token abuse and limit token reuse. These resources include
action tokens, session tokens, and exemption cookies. For more information about
using rate limiting with reCAPTCHA, see the
bot management overview .
Custom error responses
You can apply custom error responses to Cloud Armor rate limiting,
including throttle and rate_based_ban traffic. When these limits are
enforced, custom error messages are sent to end users. In addition, when you
use a global external Application Load Balancer, you can configure custom error responses for
specific HTTP status codes generated by load balancers or backend instances.
For more information about custom error responses, see the
Custom error response overview .
To configure custom error responses, see
Configure custom error responses .
Cloud Armor with Cloud Service Mesh
Note: The fairshare rate limiting action is only available for rules in
internal service security policies.
You can configure internal service security policies for your service mesh to
enforce global server-side rate limiting per client, helping you fairly share
your service's available capacity and mitigating the risk of malicious or
misbehaving clients overloading your services. You attach a security policy to a
Cloud Service Mesh endpoint policy to enforce rate limiting on inbound
traffic on the server-side. However, you can't configure a Google Cloud Armor
security policy if you are using TCP traffic routing. For more information about
using Cloud Armor with Cloud Service Mesh, see
Configure rate limiting with Cloud Armor .
