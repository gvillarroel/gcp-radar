Access DDoS attack visibility telemetry
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud Armor Enterprise lets you use Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring to
analyze DDoS attacks and their sources.
Google Cloud Armor automatically detects and mitigates network layer (Layer 3)
and transportation layer (Layer 4) attacks, performing the mitigation before
enforcing security policies and evaluating only well-formed requests against
your security policy rules. Therefore, traffic dropped as a result of always-on
DDoS protection does not appear in telemetry for security policies or backends.
Instead, the Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring metrics for DDoS
mitigation events are part of DDoS attack visibility, a feature available
exclusively for
Google Cloud Armor Enterprise subscribers.
The following sections explain how to use Logging and
Monitoring to analyze DDoS attacks and their sources. DDoS attack
visibility is available for the following load balancer types:
Global external Application Load Balancer
Classic Application Load Balancer
If you use
cross-project service referencing ,
you can only view the telemetry and logging associated with DDoS attack
visibility under the host or service project that includes your load balancer's
frontend and URL map. You cannot view the telemetry and logging under the
service project that includes the backend services.
In order to ensure proper logging and reporting, Cloud Armor requires
access to the following logs. These must be stored in Cloud Logging, or routed
to a logging bucket which Cloud Armor can
access.
networksecurity.googleapis.com/dos_attack
networksecurity.googleapis.com/network_dos_attack
networksecurity.googleapis.com/network_dos_attack_mitigations
Cloud Logging attack mitigation event logs
Cloud Armor generates three types of event log entries when mitigating
DDoS attacks. The log formats include analyses of client IP addresses and
geographies when possible. The following sections provide examples of the log
format for each type of event log:
Mitigation started

Mitigation ended
{

"bps": "9768000000"
},

}
}
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Logs Explorer page and view the
ProtectedEndpoint resource.
Note: The topSourceIp field might not be populated.
Go to Logs Explorer
Alternatively, you can view the network_dos_attack_mitigations log name.
Cloud Monitoring metrics
DDoS mitigation telemetry metrics are visible under the resource
Protected Network Endpoint ( ProtectedEndpoint ), which is exclusive to
application-layer (Layer 7) virtual IP addresses that are enrolled in
Google Cloud Armor Enterprise. The available metrics are as follows:
Ingress bytes ( /dos/ingress_bytes )
Ingress packets ( /dos/ingress_packets )
You can group and filter the preceding metrics based upon the
following labels:
Label
Value
project_id
The ID of your project that is enrolled in Cloud Armor Enterprise.
location
The location of your protected endpoint.
vip
The virtual IP address of the protected endpoint.
drop_status
Possible values:
processed : Traffic was not denied by
Cloud Armor always-on DDoS protection, meaning that
it was evaluated against your security policies.
blocked : Traffic was denied by Cloud Armor
always-on DDoS protection and dropped before being evaluated
against your security policies.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Metrics Explorer page.
Go to Metrics Explorer
Interpreting telemetry metrics for virtual IP addresses with low traffic volumes
For virtual IP addresses (VIPs) that receive fewer than 100,000 packets per
second, we recommend that you use a longer time window to view metrics in
Cloud Monitoring. For example, where a higher-traffic VIP might use an
ALIGN_RATE of one minute, we instead recommend an ALIGN_RATE of 10 minutes.
Using a longer time window helps reduce the volume of artifacts that result from
a poor signal-to-noise ratio.
In addition, some components of the rate at which Cloud Armor drops
traffic (the drop rate) are inferred by statistical means, and might be less
accurate for low-traffic VIPs. This means that during a DDoS attack, the drop
rate that Cloud Monitoring reports might be slightly lower than the true
drop rate. This reduces statistical artifacts that can lead to an overestimation
of the volume of dropped traffic, especially for VIPs that receive a low volume
of traffic and are not under attack.
