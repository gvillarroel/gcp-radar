Address groups overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
An address group contains multiple IP addresses, IP address ranges in CIDR
format, or both. Each address group can be used by multiple resources, such as
rules in Cloud NGFW firewall policies or rules in
Cloud Armor security policies.
Updates to an address group are automatically propagated to the resources that
reference the address group. For example, you can create an address group
containing a set of trusted IP addresses. To change the set of trusted IP
addresses, you update the address group. Your updates to the address group are
reflected in each associated resource automatically.
Specifications
Address group resources have the following characteristics:
Each address group is uniquely identified by a URL with
the following elements:
Container type: Determines the address group type— organization or project .
Container ID: ID of the organization or the project.
Location: Specifies if the address group is a global or regional resource (such as europe-west ).
Name: The address group name with the following format:
A string 1-63 characters long
Includes only alphanumeric characters
Must not start with a number
You can construct a unique URL identifier for an address group in the
following format:
<containerType>/<containerId>/locations/<location>/addressGroups/<address-group-name>
For example, a global address group example-address-group in project
myproject has the following unique 4-tuple identifier:
projects/myproject/locations/global/addressGroups/example-address-group
Each address group has an associated type that can be either IPv4 or IPv6,
but not both. The address group type cannot be changed later.
Each IP address or IP range in an address group is referred to as an item .
The number of items that you can add to an address group depends on the
address group's capacity. You can define the item capacity during address
group creation. This capacity cannot be changed later. The maximum capacity
that you can configure for an address group varies depending on the product
with which you use the address group.
You must specify the capacity and type when you create an address group. In
addition, when you use Cloud Armor, you must set the purpose
field to CLOUD_ARMOR .
When you create an address group with a purpose that is not
CLOUD_ARMOR , the address group has a maximum capacity of 1,000 IP
addresses.
Types of address groups
Address groups are classified based on their scope. The scope identifies the level
at which the address group is applicable in the
resource hierarchy .
Address groups are categorized into the following types:
Project-scoped address groups
Organization-scoped address groups
An address group can be either project-scoped or organization-scoped, but not
both.
Project-scoped address groups
Use project-scoped address groups when you want to define your own list of IP
addresses to be used within a project or a network to block or allow a list of
changing IP addresses. For example, if you want to define your own threat
intelligence list and add it to a rule, create an address group with the
required IP addresses.
The container type for project-scoped address groups is
always set to project . For more information about how to create and modify
project-scoped address groups, see Use project-scoped address groups .
Organization-scoped address groups
Use organization-scoped address groups when you want to define a central list of
IP addresses that can be used in high-level rules to provide
consistent control for the entire organization and reduce the overhead for
individual network and project owners to maintain common lists, such as trusted
services and internal IP addresses.
The container type for organization-scoped address groups is always set to
organization . For more information about how to create and modify
organization-scoped address groups, see
Use organization-scoped address groups .
How address groups work with security policies
Address groups simplify the configuration and maintenance of security policies
because you can share each list of IP addresses across many security policies.
Consider the following additional specifications when you use address groups
with security policies:
Address groups are only available for globally scoped
backend security policies .
Organization-scoped address groups are available for both service-level
security policies and hierarchical security policies.
The capacity of an address group is added to the total attribute count of
the security policy where the address group is used. Make sure that you set
the capacity to an appropriate value based on your use case.
To use address groups, your project must be enrolled in
Cloud Armor Enterprise .
If you downgrade to standard billing, you
can't create new address groups or modify existing address groups.
You also can't create rules that reference an existing address group, and your
security policies that reference address groups are frozen. This means that
they are still active, but that you can't modify them until you
delete all of the rules that reference an address group.
We recommend that you view the quotas
and limits for address groups.
In addition to configuring organization-scoped address groups for your backend
security policies, you can configure organization-scoped address groups for your
hierarchical security policies. You can't use project-scoped address groups in any
security policies outside of the project in which they exist, but you can share
organization-scoped address groups with security policies across your entire
organization; this makes organization-scoped address groups with security
policies especially helpful when you use them with hierarchical security policies. For
more information about hierarchical security policies, see the
Hierarchical security policies overview .
Examples
The following examples demonstrate how you might use address groups to help
you configure security policies:
Imagine that you have a network configuration in which you have three backend
services, each of which has one security policy. In addition, you have a list
of IP addresses that you know are malicious. When you create a deny rule in
each security policy, you can create one address group and use it with all
three security policies instead of adding the list of IP addresses to each
security policy. Then, whenever you create a new security policy, you can
use the address group again to make new rules.
Imagine that you have an organization with many projects that are grouped into
folders, and you have three lists of IP addresses that each need access to
only some of these folders. You can create three organization-scoped
address groups, one for each list of IP addresses, and then create three
hierarchical security policies. You can give each hierarchical security policy an
allow rule that matches on one of the three address groups, then associate
the hierarchical security policy with each folder that the allowed IP address
group needs to access.
