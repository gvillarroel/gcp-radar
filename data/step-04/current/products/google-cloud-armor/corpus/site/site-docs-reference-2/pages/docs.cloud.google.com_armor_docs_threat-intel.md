Apply Google Threat Intelligence
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Threat Intelligence lets Google Cloud Armor Enterprise
subscribers secure their traffic by allowing or blocking traffic to their
external Application Load Balancers based on several categories of threat intelligence data.
Google Threat Intelligence data is divided into the following categories:
Tor exit nodes: Tor
is open-source software that enables anonymous communication. To exclude
users who hide their identity, block the IP addresses of Tor exit nodes (points
at which traffic exits the Tor network).
Known malicious IP addresses: IP addresses that need to be blocked to improve
your application's security posture because attacks on web applications are
known to originate there.
Search engines: IP addresses that you can allow to enable site indexing.
VPN providers: IP addresses that are used by low-reputation VPN providers.
This category can be blocked to deny attempts to circumnavigate IP
address-based rules.
Anonymous proxies: IP addresses that are used by known anonymous proxies.
Crypto miners: IP addresses that are used by known cryptocurrency mining
websites.
Public cloud IP address ranges: This category can be either blocked
to avoid malicious automated tools from browsing web applications or allowed
if your service uses other public clouds.
To use Google Threat Intelligence, you define security policy rules that
allow or block traffic based on some or all of these categories by using the
evaluateThreatIntelligence match expression along with a feed name that
represents one of the preceding categories. In addition, you must subscribe to
Cloud Armor Enterprise. For more information about Cloud Armor Enterprise,
see the
Cloud Armor Enterprise overview .
Configure Google Threat Intelligence
To use Google Threat Intelligence, you configure security policy rules
by using the evaluateThreatIntelligence(' FEED_NAME ')
match expression, providing a FEED_NAME based on
the category that you want to allow or block. Information within each feed is
continually updated, protecting services from new threats without additional
configuration steps. The valid arguments are as follows.
Feed name
Description
iplist-tor-exit-nodes
Matches Tor exit nodes' IP addresses
iplist-known-malicious-ips
Matches IP addresses known to attack web applications
iplist-search-engines-crawlers
Matches IP addresses of search engine crawlers
iplist-vpn-providers
Matches IP address ranges that are used by low-reputation VPN providers
iplist-anon-proxies
Matches IP address ranges that belong to open anonymous proxies
iplist-crypto-miners
Matches IP address ranges that belong to crypto mining sites
iplist-cloudflare
Matches IPv4
and IPv6 address ranges of Cloudflare proxy services
iplist-fastly
Matches IP address
ranges of Fastly proxy services
iplist-imperva
Matches IP address
ranges of Imperva proxy services
iplist-public-clouds
iplist-public-clouds-aws
iplist-public-clouds-azure
iplist-public-clouds-gcp
Matches IP addresses belonging to public clouds
Matches IP address ranges used by Amazon Web Services
Matches IP address ranges used by Microsoft Azure
Matches IP address ranges used by Google Cloud
You can configure a new security policy rule using the following gcloud command,
with a FEED_NAME from the previous table and any ACTION
like allow , deny , or throttle . For more information about rule actions,
see policy types .
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy= NAME \
--expression="evaluateThreatIntelligence(' FEED_NAME ')" \
--action=" ACTION "
Replace the following:
NAME : the name of the security policy that you want
to set up
FEED_NAME : the feed name from the previous table
ACTION : the action to take for the rule, such as allow , deny , or throttle
Examples of Google Threat Intelligence expressions
You can use Google Threat Intelligence with a user IP.
The following example command uses the iplist-tor-exit-nodes feed name with a caller's User IP:
evaluateThreatIntelligence('iplist-tor-exit-nodes', origin.user_ip)
For more information, see User IP addresses overview .
Note: If the second parameter is not provided, it defaults to origin.ip .
You can prevent Google Threat Intelligence from blocking a
specific IP address or IP address range by adding the address to the exclusion
list.
The following example command uses the iplist-known-malicious-ips feed name:
evaluateThreatIntelligence('iplist-known-malicious-ips', [' ADDRESS '])
Replace ADDRESS with the address or address range
that you want to exclude.
You can use Google Threat Intelligence with a User IP. Add an IP address
or IP address range to the exclusion list to prevent
Google Threat Intelligence from blocking it.
The following example command uses the iplist-known-malicious-ips feed name with a User IP:
evaluateThreatIntelligence('iplist-known-malicious-ips', origin.user_ip, [' ADDRESS '])
Use named IP address lists
Note: Cloud Armor named IP address lists are deprecated. We recommend
that you use Google Threat Intelligence feeds instead.
Cloud Armor-named IP address lists let you reference lists of IP
addresses and IP ranges that are maintained by third-party providers. You
can configure named IP address lists within a security policy. You don't need to
manually specify each IP address or IP range individually.
In this document, the terms IP address and IP address list include IP
address ranges .
Named IP address lists are lists of IP addresses grouped under
different names. The name typically refers to the provider. Named IP address
lists are not subject to the quota limit on the number of IP addresses per rule.
Named IP address lists are not security policies. You incorporate them
into a security policy by referencing them as expressions the same way that you
reference a preconfigured rule.
For example, if a third-party provider has an IP address list of {ip1, ip2,
ip3....ip_N_} under the name provider-a , you can create a security rule that
allows all IP addresses that are in the provider-a list and excludes IP
addresses that are not in that list:
gcloud beta compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredExpr('provider-a')" \
--action "allow"
Replace POLICY_NAME with the name of the security policy that you want
to set up.
You cannot create your own custom named IP address lists. This feature is
available only with respect to named IP address lists that are maintained by
third-party providers that partner with Google. If such named IP address lists
don't meet your needs, you can create a security policy where the rules allow
or deny access to your resources based on the IP address from which requests
originate. For more information, see
Configure Cloud Armor security policies .
To use named IP address lists, you must subscribe to
Google Cloud Armor Enterprise and
enroll projects in Cloud Armor Enterprise. For more information, see
Availability of named IP address lists .
Allowing traffic only from permitted third-party providers
A typical use case is to create an allowlist containing the IP addresses of
a permitted third-party partner to ensure that only traffic coming from this
partner can access the load balancer and the backends.
For example, CDN providers need to pull content from origin servers at regular
intervals to distribute them to their own caches. A partnership with
Google provides a direct connection between CDN providers and the Google
network edge. CDN users on Google Cloud can use this direct connection
during origin pulls. In this case, the CDN user might want to build a security
policy that only allows traffic coming from that particular CDN provider.
In this example, a CDN provider publishes its IP address list
23.235.32.0/20, 43.249.72.0/22, ⋯, . A CDN user configures a security rule
that only allows traffic coming from these IP addresses. As a result, two
CDN provider access points are allowed ( 23.235.32.10 and 43.249.72.10 ) and
their traffic is therefore permitted. Traffic from the unauthorized access point
198.51.100.1 is blocked.

Simplifying configuration and management by using preconfigured rules
CDN providers often use IP addresses that are well-known and that many CDN
users need to use. These lists change over time, as providers add, remove, and
update the IP addresses.
Using a named IP address list in a security policy rule simplifies the process
of configuring and managing IP addresses because Cloud Armor
automatically synchronizes information from CDN providers on a daily basis.
This eliminates the time-consuming and error-prone process of maintaining a
large IP address list manually.
The following is an example of a preconfigured rule that allows all traffic
from a provider:
evaluatePreconfiguredExpr('provider-a') => allow traffic
IP address list providers
The IP address list providers in the following table are supported for
Cloud Armor. These are CDN providers that have partnered with
Google. Their IP address lists are published through individual public URLs.
These partners provide separate lists of IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses.
Cloud Armor uses the provided URLs to fetch lists, and then converts the
lists into named IP address lists. You refer to the lists by the names in the
table.
For example, the following code creates a rule in the security policy
POLICY_NAME with priority 750, incorporating the named IP
address list from Cloudflare and allowing access from those IP addresses:
gcloud beta compute security-policies rules create 750 \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredExpr('sourceiplist-cloudflare')" \
--action "allow"
Replace POLICY_NAME with the name of the security policy that you want
to set up.
Provider
URLs
IP address list name
Fastly
https://api.fastly.com/public-ip-list
sourceiplist-fastly
Cloudflare
https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4
https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6
sourceiplist-cloudflare
Imperva
https://my.imperva.com/api/integration/v1/ips
Access to Imperva's list requires a POST request. You
can use the following command as well:
curl -d "" https://my.imperva.com/api/integration/v1/ips
sourceiplist-imperva
To list the preconfigured named IP address lists, use this gcloud CLI
command:
gcloud compute security-policies list-preconfigured-expression-sets \
--filter="id:sourceiplist"
This returns:
EXPRESSION_SET
sourceiplist-fastly
sourceiplist-cloudflare
sourceiplist-imperva
Synchronizing IP address lists
Cloud Armor synchronizes IP address lists with each provider only
when it detects changes that are in a valid format. Cloud Armor
performs basic syntax validation on the IP addresses in all lists.
Availability of named IP address lists
Google Cloud Armor Enterprise is in general
availability. The availability of named IP address lists from third parties is
as follows:
If you are subscribed to the Google Cloud Armor Enterprise tier, you are licensed
to use named IP address lists in enrolled projects. You can create, update,
and delete rules with named IP address lists.
If your Google Cloud Armor Enterprise tier subscription expires, or you otherwise
return to Standard tier, you cannot add or modify rules with named IP address
lists, but you can delete existing rules and update rules to remove a named
IP list.
For projects that already include rules with named IP address lists and that
you did not enroll in Google Cloud Armor Enterprise, you can continue to use,
update, and delete existing rules with named IP address lists. In such
projects, you can create new rules that incorporate named IP address lists.
