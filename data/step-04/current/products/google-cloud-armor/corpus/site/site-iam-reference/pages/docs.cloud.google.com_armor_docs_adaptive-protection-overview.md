Google Cloud Armor Adaptive Protection overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud Armor Adaptive Protection helps you protect your Google Cloud applications, websites,
and services against L7 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks such as
HTTP floods and other high-frequency layer 7 (application-level) malicious
activity. Adaptive Protection builds machine-learning models that do the
following:
Detect and alert on anomalous activity
Generate a signature describing the potential attack
Generate a custom Cloud Armor WAF rule to block the signature
You enable or disable Adaptive Protection on a per-security-policy
basis.
Alerts about anomalous traffic (potential attacks), which include the signatures
of the attacks, appear in the Adaptive Protection event dashboard with event
logs sent to Cloud Logging, where they can be directly analyzed or forwarded
to a downstream log or security event monitoring workflow. Alerts of potential
attacks are also generated as findings in the
Security Command Center .
Availability of Adaptive Protection
Full Adaptive Protection alerts are available only if you subscribe to
Google Cloud Armor Enterprise. Otherwise, you receive only a basic alert. A basic
alert contains only minimal information, such as a confidence score of the
detection and the attack size. A basic alert includes no attack signature or
suggested rule for users to deploy.
If your projects are not already enrolled in Cloud Armor Enterprise, read
Using Cloud Armor Enterprise for
information about how to enroll.
Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring
Because using Adaptive Protection effectively requires you to understand
how logging and alerting work in Google Cloud, we recommend that you
familiarize yourself with Cloud Logging, alerting, and alerting policies.
For general logging information, see the Cloud Logging documentation .
For information about alerting, see the Cloud Monitoring documentation .
For Cloud Armor-specific logging information, see Using request logging .
In order to ensure proper logging and reporting, Cloud Armor requires
access to the following logs. These must be stored in Cloud Logging, or routed
to a logging bucket which Cloud Armor can
access.
networksecurity.googleapis.com/dos_attack
networksecurity.googleapis.com/network_dos_attack
networksecurity.googleapis.com/network_dos_attack_mitigations
Configure and tune alerts
You can enable Adaptive Protection in projects where Cloud Armor
security policies already protect your applications. When you enable
Adaptive Protection for a particular security policy,
Adaptive Protection is in effect for all backend services with which the
security policy is associated.
After Adaptive Protection is enabled, there's a training period of at least
one hour before Adaptive Protection develops a reliable baseline and
begins monitoring traffic and generating alerts. During the training period,
Adaptive Protection models incoming traffic and usage patterns that are
specific to each backend service, so that it develops the baseline for each
backend service. When the training period is over, you receive real-time alerts
when Adaptive Protection identifies high frequency or high volume anomalies
in the traffic directed to any of the backend services associated with that
security policy.
Warning: When you create a new security policy, Adaptive Protection must
re-train to develop a new baseline, and your old baseline is discarded. We
strongly recommend that you not create new security policies during an attack.
You can tune Adaptive Protection alerts based on several metrics. The
alerts, which are sent to Cloud Logging, include a confidence level , an
attack signature , a suggested rule, and an estimated impacted baseline rate
associated with the suggested rule.
The confidence level indicates the confidence with which Adaptive Protection
models predict that the observed change in traffic pattern is anomalous.
The impacted baseline rates associated with the suggested rule represent the
percentage of existing baseline traffic that is caught by the rule. Two
rates are provided. The first is the percentage relative to the traffic into
the specific backend service under attack. The second is the percentage
relative to all the traffic going through the security policy including all
configured backend service targets (not just the one being attacked).
You can filter alerts in Cloud Logging based on the
confidence level or the impacted baseline rates, or both. For more information
about tuning alerts, see Managing alerting policies .
Adaptive Protection aims to protect backend services from high volume Layer
7 DDoS attacks. In the following scenarios, requests are not counted in
Adaptive Protection:
Requests directly served from Cloud CDN
Requests rejected by a Cloud Armor security policy
Granular models
By default, Adaptive Protection detects an attack and suggests mitigations
based on the typical traffic directed to each backend service. This means that
a backend behind a backend service can become overloaded, but
Adaptive Protection takes no action because the attack traffic is not
anomalous to the backend service.
The granular models feature lets you configure specific hosts or paths as the
granular units that Adaptive Protection analyzes. When you use granular
models, Adaptive Protection's suggested mitigations filter traffic based on
matched host or URL path prefixes, helping to reduce false positives. Each of
these hosts or paths is called a granular traffic unit .
The identified attack signatures only target the attack traffic coming
into the granular traffic unit; however, the filtering still applies to
all of the requests matched by the deployed rule, like it would without the
granular configurations. For example, if you want an auto-deployed rule to
only match a specific traffic granular unit, consider using a match
condition like evaluateAdaptiveProtectionAutoDeploy() && request.headers['host'] == ... && request.path == ... .
In addition to host and URL path prefixes, you can configure alert thresholds
based on some or all of the following options. You can apply these thresholds to
the granular traffic units or to the backend service as a whole, except for the
load threshold which can only be applied to the backend service:
Load: the maximum load for the backend service, according to the configured
Application Load Balancer. This option is not available to granular
traffic units and is not available to serverless backends like
Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions, or external origin backends.
Absolute queries per second (QPS): the peak traffic amount, in
queries per second, that the backend service or traffic unit receives.
Relative to the baseline QPS: a multiple of the average long-term baseline
traffic volume. For example, a value of 2 represents a QPS of double the
baseline traffic volume.
For more information about configuring granular models, see
Configure Google Cloud Armor Adaptive Protection .
Consume and interpret alerts
As soon as Adaptive Protection detects a suspected attack, it generates an
event in the Adaptive Protection event dashboard and generates a log item in
Cloud Logging. The alert is in the JSON payload of the log item. The
log item is generated under the Network Security Policy resource in
Cloud Logging. The log message identifies the backend service under
attack and includes a confidence score indicating how strongly
Adaptive Protection rates the identified traffic pattern change as anomalous.
The log message also includes an attack signature that illustrates the
characteristics of the attack traffic, along with suggested
Cloud Armor rules that you might apply to mitigate the attack.
Understand attack signatures
An Adaptive Protection alert includes an attack signature , which is a
description of the traffic attributes of the potential attack. You use the
signature to identify and potentially block the attack. The signature takes two
forms: as a user-readable table and as a preconstructed Cloud Armor WAF
rule that you can deploy in the relevant security policy. If you are
not subscribed to Cloud Armor Enterprise, an attack signature is not
included in the basic alert.
The signature consists of a set of attributes, such as client IP address,
geographical regions, cookies, user agents, referers and other HTTP request
headers, and the set of values for those attributes thought to be associated
with the potential attack traffic. The set of attributes is not user-
configurable. The attribute values depend on the values in the incoming traffic
to your backend service.
For each attribute value that Adaptive Protection believes indicates the
potential attack, Adaptive Protection lists the following:
The attack likelihood
The proportion of the attribute in the attack, which is the percentage of
potential attack traffic that had this value at the time that the attack
was detected
The proportion of the attribute in baseline, which is the percentage of
baseline traffic that possessed this attribute value at time that the
attack was detected
Cloud Logging entry specification
contains details about the information in each alert.
The following is an example of a user-readable table that contains the signature
of a potential attack:

An Adaptive Protection alert and the relevant Cloud Logging event
log contain the following:
A unique alert ID, or alertID , which is used to refer to a specific alert
when it reports user feedback (more below)
The backend service under attack, or backendService
The confidence score, or confidence , which is a number between 0 and 1 that
indicates how strongly the Adaptive Protection system rates the detected
event as a malicious attack
You also receive a set of signatures and rules characterizing the
detected attack. Specifically, the set provides a list of headerSignatures ,
each corresponding to one HTTP header and containing a list of significantValues
for the specific header. Each significant value is either an observed header
value or a substring of it.
The following is an example signature:
...
headerSignatures: [
0: {
name: "Referer"
significantValues: [
0: {
attackLikelihood: 0.95
matchType: "MATCH_TYPE_EQUALS"
proportionInAttack: 0.6
proportionInBaseline: 0.01
value: "foo.attacker.com"
}
]
}
...
The alert suggests that the value foo.attacker.com in the header Referer is
important in characterizing the attack. More specifically, 60% of the attack
traffic ( proportionInAttack ) has this Referer value and only 1% of baseline
traffic among all traffic ( proportionInBaseline ) has the same Referer
value. Moreover, among all traffic matching this Referer value, 95% is attack
traffic ( attackLikelihood ).
These values suggest that if you were to block all requests with foo.attacker.com
in the Referer header field, you would successfully block 60% of the attack
and also 1% of the baseline traffic.
The property matchType specifies the relationship between the
attribute in the attack traffic and the significant value. It can be either
MATCH_TYPE_CONTAINS or MATCH_TYPE_EQUALS .
The next signature matches traffic with a substring /api? in the request URI:
...
headerSignatures: [
0: {
name: "RequestUri"
significantValues: [
0: {
attackLikelihood: 0.95
matchType: "MATCH_TYPE_CONTAINS"
proportionInAttack: 0.9
proportionInBaseline: 0.01
value: "/api?"
}
]
}
...
Deploy suggested rules
Adaptive Protection alerts also provide a suggested Cloud Armor
rule expressed in the custom rules language .
This rule can be used to create a rule in a Cloud Armor security
policy to mitigate the attack. In addition to the signature, the alert
includes a rate of impacted baseline traffic to help you evaluate the impact of
deploying the rule. The rate of impacted baseline traffic is a projected
proportion of baseline traffic that matches the attack signature identified by
Adaptive Protection. If you are not subscribed to Cloud Armor Enterprise,
basic alerts sent by Adaptive Protection do not include a suggested
Cloud Armor rule that you can apply.
You can find some of the alert signature as well as the impacted baseline rate
in the log message sent to Cloud Logging. The following example is the JSON
payload of a sample alert along with the resource labels on which you can filter
the logs.

}
...
You can deploy suggested rules by copying the CEL expression from the rule
signature and pasting the expression into the match condition of a newly created
rule, or by clicking the Apply button on the Adaptive Protection
dashboard in the Cloud Armor UI.
To deploy the rule, you create a new rule in the Cloud Armor security
policy that protects the targeted backend services identified by the alert.
Next, during rule configuration, copy and paste the CEL expression from the
alert into the Match condition field of the rule and set the rule action to
deny . In the above example, you copy the expression
evaluateAdaptiveProtection('11275630857957031521') from the suggestedRule
section of the alert.
We strongly recommend that you initially deploy the rule in
preview mode so that you can
evaluate the impact of the rule on production traffic. When you do this,
Cloud Armor logs the action and the associated traffic whenever the
rule is triggered, but no action is taken on the matched traffic.
In addition, if your security policy is attached to multiple backend services,
note whether the effects of the new rule have unwanted effects in any of
the backend services. If this happens, configure new security policies to
mitigate the unwanted effects, and attach them to the correct backend services.
We recommend that you set the priority for the new rule higher than any rules
with the action set to allow. This is because, to have the projected impact and
have maximal effect in mitigating the attack, the rule should be deployed in the
highest logical priority position to ensure that all matching traffic is blocked
by the rule. Rules in a Cloud Armor security policy are evaluated in
priority order with evaluation terminating after the first matching rule is
triggered and the associated rule action is taken. If you need to grant an
exception for some traffic or specific clients from this rule, an "allow" rule
can be created with higher priority, that is, with a lower numerical value.
For more information about rule priority, see
Rule evaluation order .
Automatically deploy suggested rules
You can also configure Adaptive Protection to automatically deploy suggested
rules. To enable automatic rule deployment, you create a placeholder rule with
your choice of priority and action by using the expression
evaluateAdaptiveProtectionAutoDeploy() in the match condition. This rule
evaluates to true for requests that Adaptive Protection identifies as
attack traffic, and Cloud Armor applies the action to the attacking
request. All Cloud Armor action types, like allow , deny ,
throttle , and redirect are supported. In addition, you can use preview mode
to log that the rule was triggered, without taking the configured action.
If you use an upstream proxy such as a third-party CDN in front of your
external Application Load Balancer, we recommend that you configure the
userIpRequestHeaders field
to add your provider's IP address (or IP address ranges) to an allowlist. This
prevents Adaptive Protection from mistakenly identifying the proxy's client
IP address as participating in an attack. Instead, it looks at the
user-configured field for the client IP address of the traffic before it arrived
at the proxy.
For more information about configuring automatic rule deployment, see
Automatically deploy Adaptive Protection suggested rules .
Rule status
If no rule is presented when you attempt to deploy a suggested rule, you can
use the ruleStatus field to determine the cause.
The value of the attackSize field is in queries per second (QPS).
]
ruleStatus: RULE_GENERATED
attackSize: 5000
}
The following table describes the possible values of the field and what they
mean.
Rule status
Description
RULE_GENERATED
A usable rule was generated normally.
BASELINE_TOO_RECENT
Not enough time to accumulate reliable baseline traffic. Up to one hour is necessary to generate rules.
NO_SIGNIFICANT_VALUE_DETECTED
No headers have significant values associated with attack traffic, so no rule could be generated.
NO_USABLE_RULE_FOUND
No usable rule could be created.
ERROR
An unspecified error occurred when creating the rule.
Monitoring, feedback, and reporting event errors
You need the following permissions to view or interact with the
Adaptive Protection dashboard.
compute.securityPolicies.list
compute.backendServices.list
logging.logEntries.list
After you enable Adaptive Protection on any Cloud Armor security
policy, you can see the following page under Network Security >
Cloud Armor panel. It displays the traffic volume over time for the
selected security policy and backend service, and the selected duration. Any
instances of potential attacks alerted by Adaptive Protection are annotated
on the graph and listed below the graph. When you click a specific attack event,
a side window is displayed with the attack signature and suggested rule shown in
tabular format. This is same information that's in the Cloud Logging log
entries that are described in Cloud Logging entry specification .
Click the Apply button to add the suggested rule to the same security policy.
Adaptive Protection dashboard (click to
enlarge)
Adaptive Protection dashboard (click to

Not every Adaptive Protection finding is deemed an attack, given the
protected backend service's unique context and environmental factors. If you
determine that the potential attack described by the alert is normal or accepted
behavior, then you can report an event error to help train the
Adaptive Protection models. Next to each attack event listed under the graph
is a button that pops up an interactive window to allow you to report an event
error with some optional context. Reporting an event error helps reduce the
likelihood of similar errors in the future. Over time, this increases
Adaptive Protection's accuracy.
Monitoring, alerting, and logging
Adaptive Protection telemetry is sent to Cloud Logging as well as
the Security Command Center. The Adaptive Protection log message sent to
Cloud Logging is described in the previous sections of this document. A
log entry is generated every time Adaptive Protection detects a potential
attack and each entry contains a confidence score describing how confident the
models are that the observed traffic is anomalous. To fine-tune alerting, an
alerting policy can be configured in Cloud Logging to trigger an alert
only when an Adaptive Protection log message has a confidence score above a
user-specified threshold. We recommend that you start with a low threshold, with
confidence > 0.5, to avoid missing warnings of potential attacks. The confidence
threshold in the alerting policy can be increased over time if the alerts have
an unacceptable impacted baseline rate.
The Security Command Center dashboard also contains findings from
Adaptive Protection. They are located in the Cloud Armor card under
the Application DDoS Attacks category. Each finding includes the details of
the service, the attack confidence, the signature associated with the attack,
and a link to the specific alert on the Adaptive Protection dashboard. The
following screenshot is an example of an application DDoS attack attempt
finding:
Application DDoS attack finding (click to
enlarge).
Cloud Logging entry specification
The Adaptive Protection alert sent to Cloud Logging consists of a
log entry containing the following elements:
Alert confidence: Adaptive Protection confidence that the event observed
is an attack.
Automatically deployed: the flag indicates whether the criteria for automatic
defense was triggered at the time of detection . Note that it does not
necessarily suggest a traffic impacting action was already taken. Automatic
defense is dynamic, continuously evaluating trigger criteria and identifying
attackers. To see the specific actions taken, check the relevant fields in the
Cloud Armor request logging .
Attack signature
Attribute name: the name of the attribute which matches to the Value
below, such as a particular request header name or a geographic origin.
Value: the value to which the attribute in malicious traffic matches.
Match type: the relationship between Value and the attribute in attack
traffic. the value is either equal to or a substring of an attribute in
attack traffic.
Attack likelihood: the likelihood that a given request is malicious, given
that the relevant attribute of this request matches Value .
Proportion in attack: the percent of potential attack traffic that matches
Value .
Proportion in baseline: the percent of normal, baseline traffic that matches
Value .
Suggested rule
Match condition: the expression to be used in the rules match condition to
identify malicious traffic.
Impacted baseline rate: the projected percentage of good traffic to the
specific backend service under attack that is captured by the suggested rule.
Impacted baseline rate across policy: the projected percentage of good
traffic to all the backend services in the same security policy that is
captured by the suggested rule.
Impacted attack rate: the projected percentage of attack traffic that is
captured by the suggested rule.
Rule status: additional details about rule generation.
Machine learning overview and privacy
Training data and detection data
Adaptive Protection builds several models to
detect potential attacks and identify their signatures. The signals used by
these models to determine if an attack is ongoing are derived from the
observed metadata of incoming request traffic from your projects. Such
metadata includes: client IP address, client geography, and the values of
some HTTP request headers.
The actual features used by the models are derived statistical properties
of the above-mentioned signals. That is, the
training data for the models do not include the actual values of any
metadata, such as IP addresses and/or request header values.
A common set of detection models, trained with only artificial data are
shared across all customers, to determine whether an attack is taking place,
when Adaptive Protection is first enabled. Once you report any false
attack event and the models are updated using traffic signals specific from
your projects, these models are local to your projects and are not
used for any other customers.
Signature generation data
After Adaptive Protection determines that a potential attack is
taking place, it generates an attack signature that's effective to help the
target mitigate the attack quickly. To achieve the above, after
you enable Adaptive Protection on a security policy, traffic metrics and
request metadata to a backend service (associated with the security policy)
are continually recorded to learn baseline traffic characteristics.
Because Adaptive Protection needs to learn about the baseline traffic,
Adaptive Protection might require up to one hour before generating rules
to mitigate potential attacks.
