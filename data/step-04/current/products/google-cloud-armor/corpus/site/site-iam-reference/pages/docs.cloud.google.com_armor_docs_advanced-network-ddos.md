Configure advanced network DDoS protection
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a deliberate attempt by a
hostile actor to disrupt operations of publicly exposed sites, systems, and
APIs, with the goal of degrading the experience of legitimate users.
For workloads using
external passthrough Network Load Balancers ,
protocol forwarding , or VMs with
public IP addresses, Google Cloud Armor offers the following options to help protect
systems against DDoS attacks:
Standard network DDoS protection: basic always-on protection for external passthrough Network Load Balancer,
protocol forwarding, or VMs with public IP addresses. This is
covered under Google Cloud Armor Standard and does not require any
additional subscriptions.
Advanced network DDoS protection: additional protections for
Cloud Armor Enterprise subscribers who use external passthrough Network Load Balancer,
protocol forwarding, or VMs with public IP addresses. For more information
about Cloud Armor Enterprise, see the
Cloud Armor Enterprise overview .
This document explains the difference between standard and advanced network DDoS protection,
how advanced network DDoS protection works, and how to enable advanced network DDoS protection.
Compare standard and advanced network DDoS protection
Use the following table to compare standard and advanced network DDoS protection
features.

using
Dynamic NICs .
How network DDoS protection works
Standard network DDoS protection is always enabled. You don't need to take any
action to enable it.
You configure advanced network DDoS protection on a per-region basis. Instead of
associating the network edge security policy with one or more target pools,
target instances, backend services, or instances with external IP addresses,
you associate it with a network edge security service in a particular region.
When you enable it for that region, Cloud Armor provides always-on
targeted volumetric attack detection and mitigation for external passthrough Network Load Balancer, protocol
forwarding, and VMs with public IP addresses in that region. You can only apply
advanced network DDoS protection to projects that are enrolled in
Cloud Armor Enterprise.
When you configure advanced network DDoS protection, you first create a security
policy of the type CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK in a region that you choose. Next, you
update the security policy to enable advanced network DDoS protection. Finally,
you create a network edge security service, a resource to which you can attach
security policies of type CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK . Attaching the security policy
to the network edge security service enables advanced network DDoS protection for all
applicable endpoints in the region that you chose.
Advanced network DDoS protection measures your baseline traffic to improve its mitigation
performance. When you enable advanced network DDoS protection, there is a training period of
24 hours before advanced network DDoS protection develops a reliable baseline and can use
its training to enhance its mitigations. When the training period is over,
advanced network DDoS protection applies additional mitigation techniques based on historical
traffic.
Activate advanced network DDoS protection
Use the following steps to activate advanced network DDoS protection.
Enroll in Cloud Armor Enterprise
Your project must be enrolled in Cloud Armor Enterprise to enable
advanced network DDoS protection on a per-region basis. After they are activated, all regional
endpoints in the activated region receive always-on advanced network DDoS protection.
Ensure that there is an active Cloud Armor Enterprise subscription in your
billing account, and that the current project is enrolled in
Cloud Armor Enterprise. For more information about enrolling in
Cloud Armor Enterprise, see
Subscribing to Cloud Armor Enterprise and enrolling projects .
Configure Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
To configure, update, or delete a Cloud Armor edge security service,
you need the following IAM permissions:
compute.networkEdgeSecurityServices.create
compute.networkEdgeSecurityServices.update
compute.networkEdgeSecurityServices.get
compute.networkEdgeSecurityServices.delete
The following table lists the IAM roles' base permissions and
their associated API methods.
IAM permission
API methods
compute.networkEdgeSecurityServices.create
networkEdgeSecurityServices insert
compute.networkEdgeSecurityServices.update
networkEdgeSecurityServices patch
compute.networkEdgeSecurityServices.get
networkEdgeSecurityServices get
compute.networkEdgeSecurityServices.delete
networkEdgeSecurityServices delete
compute.networkEdgeSecurityServices.list
networkEdgeSecurityServices aggregatedList
For more information about the IAM permissions that you need when you use
Cloud Armor, see
Set up IAM permissions for Google Cloud Armor security policies .
Configure advanced network DDoS protection
Caution: After you create the security policy described in this section, you
can't add custom rules to the policy. To add custom rules, you must
create a new network edge security policy .
Use the following steps to enable advanced network DDoS protection.
Create a security policy of type CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK , or use an existing
security policy with type CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK .
gcloud compute security-policies create SECURITY_POLICY_NAME \
--type CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK \
--region REGION
Replace the following:
SECURITY_POLICY_NAME : the name that you want
your security policy to have
REGION : the region in which you want your
security policy to be provisioned
Update the newly created or existing security policy by setting the
--network-ddos-protection flag to ADVANCED .
gcloud compute security-policies update SECURITY_POLICY_NAME \
--network-ddos-protection ADVANCED \
--region REGION
Alternatively, you can set the --network-ddos-protection flag to
ADVANCED_PREVIEW to enable the security policy in
preview mode .
gcloud beta compute security-policies update SECURITY_POLICY_NAME \
--network-ddos-protection ADVANCED_PREVIEW \
--region REGION
Create a network edge security service that references your security policy.
gcloud compute network-edge-security-services create SERVICE_NAME \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY_NAME \
--region REGION
Disable advanced network DDoS protection
To disable advanced network DDoS protection, you can either update or delete the security
policy.
Update the security policy
Use the following command to update your security policy to set the
--network-ddos-protection flag to STANDARD . Replace variables
with information that is relevant to your deployment.
gcloud compute security-policies update SECURITY_POLICY_NAME \
--network-ddos-protection STANDARD \
--region REGION
Delete the security policy
Before you can delete a network edge security policy, you must first remove it
from the network edge security service because you cannot delete in-use
security policies. Use the following steps to delete your security policy:
Remove your policy from the network edge security service or delete the
network edge security service.
To remove your policy from the network edge security service, use the
following command:
gcloud compute network-edge-security-services update SERVICE_NAME \
--security-policy="" \
--region= REGION_NAME
To delete the network edge security service, use the following command:
gcloud compute network-edge-security-services delete SERVICE_NAME \
--region= REGION_NAME
Delete the security policy using the following command:
gcloud compute security-policies delete SECURITY_POLICY_NAME
Use preview mode
Preview mode lets you monitor the effects of advanced network DDoS protection
without enforcing the mitigation.
Cloud Armor Enterprise subscribers can also enable preview mode for
advanced network DDoS protection policies. In preview mode, you receive all of the logging and
telemetry about the detected attack and the proposed mitigation. However, the
proposed mitigation is not enforced. This lets you test the
effectiveness of the mitigation before enabling it. Because each policy is
configured per region, you can enable or disable preview mode per region.
To enable preview mode, you set the --ddos-protection flag to ADVANCED_PREVIEW .
You can use the following example to update an existing policy.
gcloud beta compute security-policies update POLICY_NAME \
--network-ddos-protection ADVANCED_PREVIEW \
--region= REGION
Replace the following:
POLICY_NAME : the name of your policy
REGION : the region in which your policy is
located.
If your security policy is in preview mode during an active attack and you want
to enforce the mitigations, you can update your security policy to set the
--network-ddos-protection flag to ADVANCED . The policy is enforced
almost immediately, and the next MITIGATION_ONGOING logging event reflects the
change. MITIGATION_ONGOING logging events occur every five minutes.
Network DDoS mitigation telemetry
Cloud Armor generates three types of event logs when mitigating DDoS
attacks: MITIGATION_STARTED , MITIGATION_ONGOING , and MITIGATION_ENDED . You
can use the following log filters to view your logs by mitigation type:
Mitigation type
Log filter
Mitigation start
resource.type="network_security_policy"
jsonPayload.mitigationType="MITIGATION_STARTED"
Mitigation ongoing
resource.type="network_security_policy"
jsonPayload.mitigationType="MITIGATION_ONGOING"
Mitigation end
resource.type="network_security_policy"
jsonPayload.mitigationType="MITIGATION_ENDED"

Security Command Center findings
The Security Command Center dashboard helps you monitor and respond to volumetric
DDoS attacks targeting your passthrough Network Load Balancer and virtual machines. When
Cloud Armor detects an attack, a dedicated finding labeled
"Volumetric DDoS Attack Attempt - Network LB/VMs" appears on the dashboard and
the Cloud Armor card.
The finding includes direct links to relevant logs, and provides the following
information to help you understand the attack:
The specific resource under attack
The volume of traffic affecting the resource
The classification of the attack (like UDP, TCP, or SYN flood)
The finding dynamically reflects the attack status. Attack status is based on the following log events:
Mitigation started: the finding appears when mitigation measures begin
Mitigation ongoing: as the mitigation progresses, the finding updates
automatically, keeping you informed of the ongoing situation. The following
screenshot shows an example active finding:
An active Security Command Center finding (click to enlarge).
Mitigation ended: when the attack subsides and mitigation ends, the finding
becomes inactive, providing a record of the event. The following screenshot
shows an example inactive finding:
An inactive Security Command Center finding (click to enlarge).
