Configure rate limiting
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page contains information about configuring Google Cloud Armor rules
to enforce per-client rate limits by configuring a throttle or rate-based ban
action. Before you configure rate limiting, make sure that you're familiar with
the information in the
rate limiting overview .
Before you begin
The following sections explain all of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and
permissions required to configure Cloud Armor security policies. For
the use cases in this document, you only need the
compute.securityPolicies.create permission.
Set up IAM permissions for Cloud Armor security policies
The following operations require the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Compute Security Admin role
( roles/compute.securityAdmin ):
Configuring, modifying, updating, and deleting a Cloud Armor
security policy
Using the following API methods:
SecurityPolicies insert
SecurityPolicies delete
SecurityPolicies patch
SecurityPolicies addRule
SecurityPolicies patchRule
SecurityPolicies removeRule
A user with the
Compute Network Admin role
( roles/compute.networkAdmin ) can perform the following operations:
Setting a Cloud Armor security policy for a backend service
Using the following API methods:
BackendServices setSecurityPolicy
BackendServices list ( gcloud only)
Users with the Security Admin role
( roles/iam.securityAdmin ) and the Compute Network Admin role
( roles/compute.networkAdmin ) can view Cloud Armor security
policies by using the SecurityPolicies API methods get , list , and
getRule .
Set up IAM permissions for custom roles
The following table lists the IAM roles' base permissions, their
associated API methods, and the roles that grant that permission.

Rules for rate-based throttling
Rules for rate-based throttling have the following format in the
Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy= SECURITY_POLICY \
{--expression= EXPRESSION | --src-ip-ranges= SRC_IP_RANGE } \
--action "throttle" \
--rate-limit-threshold-count= RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD_COUNT \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec= RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL_SEC \
--conform-action=[allow] \
--exceed-action=[deny-403|deny-404|deny-429|deny-502|redirect] \
--exceed-redirect-type=[google-recaptcha|external-302] \
--exceed-redirect-target= REDIRECT_URL \
--enforce-on-key=[IP | ALL | HTTP-HEADER | XFF-IP | HTTP-COOKIE | HTTP-PATH | SNI | REGION-CODE] \
--enforce-on-key-name=[ HTTP_HEADER_NAME | HTTP_COOKIE_NAME ]
Rate limiting on single keys
For example, the following gcloud CLI command creates a throttle
rule at priority 105 with a rate limit of 100 requests each 60 seconds for
each IP address in 1.2.3.0/24 . Requests that exceed the throttling limit
return a 429 Too Many Requests status code.
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 105 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--src-ip-ranges="1.2.3.0/24" \
--action=throttle \
--rate-limit-threshold-count=100 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=60 \
--conform-action=allow \
--exceed-action=deny-429 \
--enforce-on-key=IP
For example, the following gcloud CLI command creates a throttle
rule at priority 110 with a rate limit of 10 requests each 60 seconds for each
unique value of the HTTP header User-Agent across all requests coming from IP
addresses in 1.2.3.0/24 . Requests that exceed the throttling limit return a
429 Too Many Requests status code.
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 110 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--src-ip-ranges="1.2.3.0/24" \
--action=throttle \
--rate-limit-threshold-count=10 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=60 \
--conform-action=allow \
--exceed-action=deny-429 \
--enforce-on-key=HTTP-HEADER \
--enforce-on-key-name='User-Agent'
Finally, you can issue rate-based bans for users who have a valid reCAPTCHA
exemption cookie. For example, the following gcloud CLI command
creates a throttle rule at priority 115 with a rate limit of 20 requests
per 5 minutes for each unique reCAPTCHA exemption cookie across all requests
that have a valid reCAPTCHA exemption cookie. Requests that exceed the
throttling limit are redirected for reCAPTCHA assessment. For
more information about exemption cookies and reCAPTCHA
assessment, see the
Cloud Armor bot management overview .
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 115 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--expression="token.recaptcha_exemption.valid" \
--action=throttle \
--rate-limit-threshold-count=20 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=300 \
--conform-action=allow \
--exceed-action=redirect \
--exceed-redirect-type=google-recaptcha \
--enforce-on-key=HTTP-COOKIE \
--enforce-on-key-name="recaptcha-ca-e"
Rate limiting based on JA4 and JA3 fingerprints
You can use JA4 and JA3 fingerprints as rate limiting keys. The following
example creates a throttle rule at priority 1000 with a rate limit of 20
requests per 5 minutes that matches on requests with the /login path, based on
the client's JA4 fingerprint. Requests that exceed the throttling limit are
denied.
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--expression "request.path.matches('/login')" \
--action throttle \
--rate-limit-threshold-count 20 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec 300 \
--conform-action allow \
--exceed-action deny-429 \
--enforce-on-key-configs tls-ja4-fingerprint
Rate limiting based on user IP address
When you receive requests that come through an upstream proxy, you can apply
rate limiting based on the originating client's IP address. The following
example creates a throttle rule at priority 1000 with a rate limit of 20
requests per 5 minutes that matches on requests with the /login path, based
on the originating client's IP address. Requests that exceed the throttling
limit are denied.
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--expression "request.path.matches('/login')" \
--action throttle \
--rate-limit-threshold-count 20 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec 300 \
--conform-action allow \
--exceed-action deny-429 \
--enforce-on-key-configs user-ip
For more information about user IP address support, see the
rules language reference .
Rate limiting based on multiple keys
You can also throttle traffic based on multiple rate limiting keys by using the
enforce-on-key-configs flag. This flag replaces both the enforce-on-key flag
and the enforce-on-key-name flag. The enforce-on-key-configs flag requires a
comma-separated list of KEY=NAME pairs; although, you don't need to provide a
name for some keys.
The following example creates a throttle rule for the policy
POLICY_NAME at priority 105 with a rate limit of
100 requests each 60 seconds for each combination of HTTP-PATH and site_id
across all requests coming from IP addresses in 1.2.3.0/24 . Requests that
exceed the throttling limit return a 429 Too Many Requests status code.
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 105 \
--security-policy= POLICY_NAME \
--src-ip-ranges="1.2.3.0/24" \
--action=throttle \
--rate-limit-threshold-count=100 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=60 \
--conform-action=allow \
--exceed-action=deny-429 \
--enforce-on-key-configs="HTTP-PATH,HTTP-COOKIE=site_id"
Rules for rate-based bans
Rules for rate-based bans have the following format in the gcloud CLI:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy= SECURITY_POLICY \
{--expression= EXPRESSION | --src-ip-ranges= SRC_IP_RANGE } \
--action "rate-based-ban" \
--rate-limit-threshold-count= RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD_COUNT \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec= RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL_SEC \
--ban-duration-sec= BAN_DURATION_SEC \
--ban-threshold-count= BAN_THRESHOLD_COUNT \
--ban-threshold-interval-sec= BAN_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL_SEC \
--conform-action=[allow] \
--exceed-action=[deny-403|deny-404|deny-429|deny-502|redirect] \
--exceed-redirect-type=[google-recaptcha|external-302] \
--exceed-redirect-target= REDIRECT_URL \
--enforce-on-key=[IP | ALL | HTTP-HEADER | XFF-IP | HTTP-COOKIE | HTTP-PATH | SNI | REGION-CODE] \
--enforce-on-key-name=[ HTTP_HEADER_NAME | HTTP_COOKIE_NAME ]
For example, the following gcloud CLI command creates a rate-based
ban rule at priority 100 for each IP address whose requests match a header
fish with value tuna and ban it for 300 seconds when its rate exceeds a
limit of 50 requests for each 120 seconds. Banned requests return a status code
of 404 Not Found .
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 100 \
--security-policy=sec-policy \
--expression="request.headers['fish'] == 'tuna'" \
--action=rate-based-ban \
--rate-limit-threshold-count=50 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=120 \
--ban-duration-sec=300 \
--conform-action=allow \
--exceed-action=deny-404 \
--enforce-on-key=IP
For example, the following gcloud CLI command creates a rate-based
ban rule at priority 101 to limit all requests whose region code matches US
to 10 requests per 60 seconds. The rule also bans requests from the US region
for 300 seconds when their rate exceeds a limit of 1000 requests per 600 seconds.
Banned requests return a status code of 403 Forbidden .
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 101 \
--security-policy sec-policy \
--expression "origin.region_code == 'US'" \
--action rate-based-ban \
--rate-limit-threshold-count 10 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec 60 \
--ban-duration-sec 300 \
--ban-threshold-count 1000 \
--ban-threshold-interval-sec 600 \
--conform-action allow \
--exceed-action deny-403 \
--enforce-on-key ALL
For example, the following gcloud CLI command creates a rate-based
ban rule at priority 102 to limit all requests from any source IP address
range to 20 requests per 60 seconds. The rule also bans requests from any source
IP address range for 600 seconds when the rate of requests exceeds a limit of
500 requests per 400 seconds. Banned requests return a status code of
429 Too Many Requests .
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 102 \
--security-policy sec-policy \
--src-ip-ranges="*" \
--action rate-based-ban \
--rate-limit-threshold-count 20 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec 60 \
--ban-duration-sec 600 \
--ban-threshold-count 500 \
--ban-threshold-interval-sec 400 \
--conform-action allow \
--exceed-action deny-429 \
--enforce-on-key ALL
Change a throttle rule to a rate-based ban rule
You can use the following command to change the action of an existing
rule from a throttle action to a rate-based ban action.
gcloud compute security-policies rules update 105 \
--action=rate-based-ban \
--security-policy=sec-policy \
--ban-duration-sec=600
You can't change the action of an existing rule from a rate-based ban action to
a throttle action.
