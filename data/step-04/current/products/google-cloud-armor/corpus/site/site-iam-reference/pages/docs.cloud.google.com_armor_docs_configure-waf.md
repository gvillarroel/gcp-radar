Set up preconfigured WAF rules
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Use these instructions to set up and tune Cloud Armor preconfigured
web application firewall (WAF) rules to help protect your application against
attacks. If you aren't familiar with preconfigured WAF rules, see the
overview .
Set up a preconfigured WAF rule
This section provides template preconfigured WAF rules that you can copy into
the Google Cloud console and customize to fit your use case. In each example
Google Cloud CLI command, you configure a security policy with name
POLICY_NAME and priority PRIORITY .
The first example sets up a rule with a rule name
RULE_NAME and a sensitivity level of
SENSITIVITY , which enables all signatures with
sensitivity less than or equal to SENSITIVITY . For more
information about rule sensitivity, see
Choose a sensitivity level .
Console
Select Advanced mode , then use the following example expression in the
Match field:
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf(' RULE_NAME ', {'sensitivity': SENSITIVITY })
gcloud
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf(' RULE_NAME ', {'sensitivity': SENSITIVITY })" \
--action deny-403
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the security policy
POLICY_NAME : the name of the security policy that you want
to set up
RULE_NAME : the name of the WAF rule that you want to set up
SENSITIVITY : the sensitivity level of the WAF rule
The second example is similar to the first, but it opts out rule signatures
SIGNATURE_1 and SIGNATURE_2 . This
means that these two signatures aren't evaluated when the WAF rule is evaluated:
Console
Select Advanced mode , then use the following example expression in the
Match field:
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf(' RULE_NAME ', {'sensitivity': SENSITIVITY , 'opt_out_rule_ids': [' SIGNATURE_1 ', ' SIGNATURE_2 ']})
gcloud
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf(' RULE_NAME ', {'sensitivity': SENSITIVITY , 'opt_out_rule_ids': [' SIGNATURE_1 ', ' SIGNATURE_2 ']})" \
--action deny-403
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the security policy
POLICY_NAME : the name of the security policy that you want
to set up
RULE_NAME : the name of the WAF rule that you want to set up
SENSITIVITY : the sensitivity level of the WAF rule
SIGNATURE_1 : the name of the WAF signature that you want to
opt out
SIGNATURE_2 : the name of the WAF signature that you want to
opt out
The third example is similar to the second, but instead of opting out two
signatures, you opt in two rule signatures. Note that you can only opt in rule
signatures when you set the sensitivity level to 0 :
Console
Select Advanced mode , then use the following example expression in the
Match field:
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf(' RULE_NAME ', {'sensitivity': 0, 'opt_in_rule_ids': [' SIGNATURE_1 ', ' SIGNATURE_2 ']})
gcloud
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf(' RULE_NAME ', {'sensitivity': 0, 'opt_in_rule_ids': [' SIGNATURE_1 ', ' SIGNATURE_2 ']})" \
--action deny-403
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the security policy
POLICY_NAME : the name of the security policy that you want
to set up
RULE_NAME : the name of the WAF rule that you want to set up
SIGNATURE_1 : the name of the WAF signature that you want to
opt out
SIGNATURE_2 : the name of the WAF signature that you want to
opt out
In all of the previous examples, you use only one expression per rule. While
you can combine expressions using the logical OR ( || ) logical operator, we
recommend that you use only one expression per rule as a best practice to avoid
exceeding the maximum expression size.
Update inspection limit for preconfigured WAF rules
Cloud Armor preconfigured WAF rules can only inspect up to the first
64 kB (either 8 kB, 16 kB, 32 kB, 48 kB, or 64 kB)
of a request body. You can manually configure a security
policy to use one of these inspection limits for your preconfigured WAF rules.
The following command sets the inspection limit of all preconfigured WAF
rules available in the POLICY_NAME policy to 8 kB
using the --request-body-inspection-size flag. For more information about
the inspection limits of the preconfigured WAF rules, see
Request body inspection limitation .
gcloud compute security-policies update POLICY_NAME \
--request-body-inspection-size=8kB
Replace POLICY_NAME with the name of the security policy that you want to set up.
Similarly, you can use the --request-body-inspection-size flag
to set the inspection limit of all preconfigured WAF rules available in
the POLICY_NAME policy to either
16 kB, 32 kB, 48 kB, or 64 kB.
Mitigate risk on request body that exceeds configured inspection limit
When a preconfigured WAF rule is evaluated in a Cloud Armor security
policy, up to the first 64 kB (either 8 kB, 16 kB, 32 kB,
48 kB, or 64 kB) of a request body is inspected for signature matches
against the WAF rules.
You can mitigate the risk from larger requests by creating
a rule in your security policies to help ensure that no uninspected content
reaches your backends.
For example, create a rule to deny traffic that exceeds the configured
inspection limit of 8 kB (8192 bytes) in the request body size.
The following command shows how to create this rule:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 10 \
--security-policy my-policy \
--expression "int(request.headers['content-length']) > 8192" \
--action deny-403 \
--description "Block requests greater than 8 kB"
Similarly, you can create a rule to deny traffic that exceeds the configured inspection
limits of 16 kB, 32 kB, 48 kB, or 64 kB in the request body
size. For example, the following command shows how to create this rule for
the inspection limit of 64 kB (65536 bytes).
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 10 \
--security-policy my-policy \
--expression "int(request.headers['content-length']) > 65536" \
--action deny-403 \
--description "Block requests greater than 64 kB"
Examples
The examples in this section highlight important aspects of creating and tuning
preconfigured WAF rules, including sensitivity level and signature exceptions.
In all of the gcloud CLI example commands, you create a security policy with the
name POLICY_NAME at priority
PRIORITY .
Create a rule at a given sensitivity level
In this example, you use all signatures in the sqli-v422-stable WAF rule
with a sensitivity level less than 4. Therefore, you create the rule at
sensitivity level 3, which includes all signatures with a sensitivity level
less than or equal to three:
Console
Select Advanced mode , then use the following example expression in the
Match field:
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('sqli-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 3})
gcloud
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('sqli-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 3})" \
--action deny-403
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the security policy
POLICY_NAME : the name of the security policy that you want
to set up
Create a rule that opts out one or more signatures
In this example, you use almost all of the signatures at sensitivity level
1 and 2 in the xss-v422-stable WAF rule, but you want to exclude the signature
owasp-crs-v042200-id941370-xss , which checks for JavaScript global variables.
Therefore, you create the rule at sensitivity level 2 and use the
opt_out_rule_ids argument to opt out of the owasp-crs-v042200-id941370-xss
signature:
Console
Select Advanced mode , then use the following example expression in the
Match field:
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 2, 'opt_out_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id941370-xss']})
gcloud
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 2, 'opt_out_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id941370-xss']})" \
--action deny-403
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the security policy
POLICY_NAME : the name of the security policy that you want
to set up
To exclude two or more signatures from a rule, provide a
comma-separated list of signatures with the opt_out_rule_ids argument, as
follows:
Console
Select Advanced mode , then use the following example expression in the
Match field:
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 2, 'opt_out_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id941370-xss', 'owasp-crs-v042200-id941380-xss']})
gcloud
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 2, 'opt_out_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id941370-xss', 'owasp-crs-v042200-id941380-xss']})" \
--action deny-403
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the security policy
POLICY_NAME : the name of the security policy that you want
to set up
Create a rule that opts in one or more signatures
This example uses only the signature
owasp-crs-v042200-id941150-xss from the xss-v422-stable WAF rule. The
signature checks for disallowed HTML attributes, and is at sensitivity level 2.
Therefore, you create the rule at sensitivity level 0 and use the
opt_in_rule_ids argument to opt in the owasp-crs-v042200-id941150-xss
signature. Note that you can only opt in rule signatures when you
set the sensitivity level to 0 :
Console
Select Advanced mode , then use the following example expression in the
Match field:
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 0, 'opt_in_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id941150-xss']})
gcloud
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 0, 'opt_in_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id941150-xss']})" \
--action deny-403
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the security policy
POLICY_NAME : the name of the security policy that you want
to set up
If you want to include two or more signatures from a rule, provide a
comma-separated list of signatures with the opt_in_rule_ids argument, as
follows:
Console
Select Advanced mode , then use the following example expression in the
Match field:
evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 0, 'opt_in_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id941150-xss', 'owasp-crs-v042200-id941320-xss']})
gcloud
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluatePreconfiguredWaf('xss-v422-stable', {'sensitivity': 0, 'opt_in_rule_ids': ['owasp-crs-v042200-id941150-xss', 'owasp-crs-v042200-id941320-xss']})" \
--action deny-403
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority of the security policy
POLICY_NAME : the name of the security policy that you want
to set up
