This page contains information about configuring Cloud Armor
security policy rules for bot management. Before you configure bot management,
make sure that you're familiar with the information in the
bot management overview .
Before you begin
The following sections explain all of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and
permissions required to configure Cloud Armor security policies. For
the use cases in this document, you only need the
compute.securityPolicies.create and compute.securityPolicies.update
permissions.
Set up IAM permissions for Cloud Armor security policies
The following operations require the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Compute Security Admin role
( roles/compute.securityAdmin ):
Configuring, modifying, updating, and deleting a Cloud Armor
security policy
Using the following API methods:
SecurityPolicies insert
SecurityPolicies delete
SecurityPolicies patch
SecurityPolicies addRule
SecurityPolicies patchRule
SecurityPolicies removeRule
A user with the
Compute Network Admin role
( roles/compute.networkAdmin ) can perform the following operations:
Setting a Cloud Armor security policy for a backend service
Using the following API methods:
BackendServices setSecurityPolicy
BackendServices list ( gcloud only)
Users with the Security Admin role
( roles/iam.securityAdmin ) and the Compute Network Admin role
( roles/compute.networkAdmin ) can view Cloud Armor security
policies by using the SecurityPolicies API methods get , list , and
getRule .
Set up IAM permissions for custom roles
The following table lists the IAM roles' base permissions, their
associated API methods, and the roles that grant that permission.

Use a reCAPTCHA manual challenge to distinguish between human or automated clients
To use reCAPTCHA with Cloud Armor, you must associate
your reCAPTCHA WAF site key (reCAPTCHA key) of type CHALLENGEPAGE with a
security policy. For more information about reCAPTCHA keys, see
reCAPTCHA keys overview .
To associate or disassociate your own reCAPTCHA key with a security policy, use
the following command:
gcloud compute security-policies update SECURITY_POLICY \
--recaptcha-redirect-site-key SITE_KEY
Replace the following:
SECURITY_POLICY : the name of the security policy
SITE_KEY : your reCAPTCHA CHALLENGEPAGE key
Associate a reCAPTCHA key
The following example associates a reCAPTCHA key with a security policy. The
associated reCAPTCHA key applies to all the rules that use the manual challenge
feature under the given security policy.
gcloud compute security-policies update SECURITY_POLICY \
--recaptcha-redirect-site-key " SITE_KEY "
Disassociate a reCAPTCHA key
To disassociate a reCAPTCHA key with a security policy, use this command:
gcloud compute security-policies update SECURITY_POLICY \
--recaptcha-redirect-site-key ""
Redirect traffic for reCAPTCHA assessment
When you have associated your reCAPTCHA key with your security policy, you can
create a rule within that policy to internally redirect traffic for
reCAPTCHA assessment. Use the following format in the
gcloud CLI to redirect traffic:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
{--expression EXPRESSION | --src-ip-ranges SRC_IP_RANGE } \
--action redirect \
--redirect-type google-recaptcha
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority at which you want to create the
rule
SECURITY_POLICY : the name of the security policy
EXPRESSION : the custom rules language expression that
matches the traffic on which you want to enforce reCAPTCHA assessment
SRC_IP_RANGE : an IP address range. Use this to enforce
reCAPTCHA assessment on all requests from this range.
The following example creates a rule that redirects traffic attempting to reach
/login.html for a reCAPTCHA manual challenge:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--expression "request.path.matches(\"/login.html\")" \
--action redirect \
--redirect-type google-recaptcha
Enforce reCAPTCHA frictionless assessment
Before you proceed, see the
bot management overview
for prerequisites on using reCAPTCHA action-tokens or
session-tokens.
To extract attributes from a reCAPTCHA action-token, you can use
token.recaptcha_action. ATTRIBUTE . Replace
ATTRIBUTE with a valid token attribute in the
Cloud Armor rules language .
Similarly, use token.recaptcha_session. ATTRIBUTE
to extract attributes from a reCAPTCHA session-token. For more
information about the syntax of available reCAPTCHA token
attributes, see the
rules language reference .
An action-token can originate from a web application, an iOS application, or
an Android application, while a session-token can only originate from a web
application. Each platform requires a separate reCAPTCHA key. The expressions
token.recaptcha_action. ATTRIBUTE and
token.recaptcha_session. ATTRIBUTE apply to tokens from
any of these platforms. To distinguish tokens from different platforms and
to prevent token theft, we recommend that you associate reCAPTCHA keys when you
configure rules that use these expressions.
Examples
The first example creates a rule that allows traffic targeting
/login.html with a reCAPTCHA action-token whose score is
no less than 0.8 .
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--expression "request.path.matches(\"/login.html\") && token.recaptcha_action.score >= 0.8" \
--action allow
The second example is the same as the first example, but it also requires that
the action-token be issued with a reCAPTCHA key of example-site-key-1 or
example-site-key-2 :
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--expression "request.path.matches(\"/login.html\") && token.recaptcha_action.score >= 0.8" \
--recaptcha-action-site-keys "example-site-key-1,example-site-key-2" \
--action allow
The third example creates a rule that allows traffic targeting /login.html ,
with a reCAPTCHA session-token issued with a reCAPTCHA key of
example-site-key-3 , and with a score no less than 0.8 .
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--expression "request.path.matches(\"/login.html\") && token.recaptcha_session.score >= 0.8" \
--recaptcha-session-site-keys "example-site-key-3" \
--action allow
Redirect (302 response)
To create a rule to redirect traffic to a user-configured URL, use the
following format in the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
{--expression EXPRESSION | --src-ip-ranges SRC_IP_RANGE } \
--action redirect \
--redirect-type external-302 \
--redirect-target REDIRECT_URL
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority at which you want to create the
rule
SECURITY_POLICY : the name of the security policy
EXPRESSION : the custom rules language expression that
matches the traffic up which you want to enforce reCAPTCHA assessment
SRC_IP_RANGE : an IP address range. Use this to enforce
reCAPTCHA assessment on all requests from this range.
REDIRECT_URL : the URL to which you want to redirect
traffic
The following example creates a rule that redirects traffic coming from
10.10.10.0/24 to https://www.example.com.
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--src-ip-ranges "10.10.10.0/24" \
--action redirect \
--redirect-type external-302 \
--redirect-target "https://www.example.com"
Decorate request
To create a rule that allows traffic but adds custom headers and user-defined
static values before sending them to protected backends, use the following
format in the gcloud CLI:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create PRIORITY \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
{--expression EXPRESSION | --src-ip-ranges SRC_IP_RANGE } \
--action allow \
--request-headers-to-add HEADER_1 = VALUE_1 , HEADER_2 = VALUE_2,...
Replace the following:
PRIORITY : the priority at which you want to create
the rule
SECURITY_POLICY : the name of the security policy
EXPRESSION : the custom rules language expression that
matches the traffic on which you want to enforce reCAPTCHA assessment
SRC_IP_RANGE : an IP address range. Use this to enforce
reCAPTCHA assessment on all requests from this range.
HEADER_# : the name of the request header with which
you want to decorate the request
VALUE_# : the value of the request header with which
you want to decorate the request
The following example creates a rule that allows traffic targeting /login.html ,
as long as the request also has a reCAPTCHA action-token score
lower than 0.2 .
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy SECURITY_POLICY \
--expression "request.path.matches("/login.html") && token.recaptcha_action.score < 0.2" \
--action allow \
--request-headers-to-add "reCAPTCHA-Warning=high"
