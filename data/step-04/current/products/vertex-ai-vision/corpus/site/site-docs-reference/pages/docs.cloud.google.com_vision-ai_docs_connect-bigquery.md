Connect and store data to BigQuery
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
When you add a BigQuery connector to your Vertex AI Vision app all
the connected app model outputs will be ingested to the target table.
You can either create your own BigQuery table and specify that
table when you add a BigQuery connector to the app, or let
the Vertex AI Vision app platform automatically create the table.
Caution: Data you ingest into BigQuery is first written to the
streaming buffer before they are persisted into the storage. You are not able
to use the Preview tab to view these rows in the streaming buffer. However,
you are still able to read these rows with SQL queries. Use the Details
tab of the BigQuery table to view metrics about the streaming buffer
data.
Automatic table creation
If you let Vertex AI Vision app platform automatically create the table, you
can specify this option when you add the BigQuery connector node.
The following dataset and table conditions apply if you want to use automatic
table creation:
Dataset: The automatically created dataset name is visionai_dataset .
Table: The automatically created table name is
visionai_dataset. APPLICATION_ID .
Error handling:
If the table with the same name under the same dataset exists, no automatic
creation happens.
Console
Open the Applications tab of the Vertex AI Vision dashboard.
Go to the Applications tab
Select View app next to the name of your application from the list.
On the application builder page select BigQuery from the
Connectors section.
Leave the BigQuery path field empty.
Change any other settings.
REST & CMD LINE
To let the app platform infer a table schema, use the
createDefaultTableIfNotExists field of the BigQueryConfig
when you create or update an app.
Manually create and specify a table
If you want to manage your output table manually, the table must have the
required schema as a subset of the table schema.
If the existing table has incompatible schemas, the deployment is rejected.
Use the default schema
If you use the default schema for model output tables, make sure your table only
contains the following required columns in the table. You can directly copy
the following
schema text when you create the BigQuery table. For more detailed
information about creating a BigQuery table, see
Create and use tables . For more
information about schema specification when you create a table,
see Specifying a schema .
Use the following text to describe the schema when you create a table. For
information on using the JSON column type
( "type": "JSON" ), see Working with JSON data in Standard SQL .
The JSON column type is recommended for annotation query. You can also use
"type" : "STRING" .
[
{
"name" : "ingestion_time" ,
"type" : "TIMESTAMP" ,
"mode" : "REQUIRED"
},
{
"name" : "application" ,
"type" : "STRING" ,
"mode" : "REQUIRED"
},
{
"name" : "instance" ,
"type" : "STRING" ,
"mode" : "REQUIRED"
},
{
"name" : "node" ,
"type" : "STRING" ,
"mode" : "REQUIRED"
},
{
"name" : "annotation" ,
"type" : "JSON" ,
"mode" : "REQUIRED"
}
]
Warning: The BigQuery JSON column may be unavailable in the
console. If you cannot create a JSON column in the
console, use the gcloud command below, or replace the "JSON"
column with a "STRING" column.
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
Select your project.
Select more options more_vert .
Click Create table .
In the "Schema" section, enable
toggle_on Edit as text .
gcloud
The following example first creates the request JSON file, then uses the
gcloud alpha bq tables create command .
First create the request JSON file:
echo "{
\"schema\": [
{
\"name\": \"ingestion_time\",
\"type\": \"TIMESTAMP\",
\"mode\": \"REQUIRED\"
},
{
\"name\": \"application\",
\"type\": \"STRING\",
\"mode\": \"REQUIRED\"
},
{
\"name\": \"instance\",
\"type\": \"STRING\",
\"mode\": \"REQUIRED\"
},
{
\"name\": \"node\",
\"type\": \"STRING\",
\"mode\": \"REQUIRED\"
},
{
\"name\": \"annotation\",
\"type\": \"JSON\",
\"mode\": \"REQUIRED\"
}
]
}
" >> bigquery_schema.json
Send the gcloud command. Make the following replacements:
TABLE_NAME : The ID of the table or fully
qualified identifier for the table.
DATASET : The id of the BigQuery dataset.
gcloud alpha bq tables create TABLE_NAME \
--dataset= DATASET \
--schema-file=./bigquery_schema.json

Use a customized schema
If the default schema doesn't work for your use case, you can use
Cloud Run functions to generate BigQuery rows with a user-defined schema.
If you use a custom schema there is no prerequisite for the BigQuery
table schema.
App graph with BigQuery node selected
The BigQuery connector can be connected to any model that outputs
video or proto-based annotation:
For video input, the BigQuery connector only extracts the
metadata data stored in the stream header and ingests this data
to BigQuery as other model annotation outputs. The video itself
is not stored.
If your stream contains no metadata, nothing will be stored to
BigQuery.
Query table data
With the default BigQuery table schema, you can perform powerful
analysis after the table is populated with data.
Sample queries
You can use the following sample queries in BigQuery to gain
insight from Vertex AI Vision models.
For example, you can use BigQuery to draw a time-based curve for
maximum number of detected people per minute using data from the
Person / vehicle detector model with the following
query:
WITH
nested3 AS (
WITH
nested2 AS (
WITH
nested AS (
SELECT
t . ingestion_time AS ingestion_time ,
JSON_QUERY_ARRAY ( t . annotation . stats [ "fullFrameCount" ]) AS counts
FROM
` PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . TABLE_NAME ` AS t )
SELECT
ingestion_time ,
e
FROM
nested ,
UNNEST ( nested . counts ) AS e )
SELECT
STRING ( TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( nested2 . ingestion_time , MINUTE , " America/Los_Angeles " ), " America/Los_Angeles " ) AS time ,
IFNULL ( INT64 ( nested2 . e [ "count" ]), 0 ) AS person_count
FROM
nested2
WHERE
JSON_VALUE ( nested2 . e [ "entity" ][ "labelString" ]) = "Person" )
SELECT
time ,
MAX ( person_count )
FROM
nested3
GROUP BY
time
Similarly, you can use BigQuery and the crossing line count feature
of the Occupancy analytics model to create a query that counts the
total number of vehicles that pass the crossing line per minute:
WITH
nested4 AS (
WITH
nested3 AS (
WITH
nested2 AS (
WITH
nested AS (
SELECT
t . ingestion_time AS ingestion_time ,
JSON_QUERY_ARRAY ( t . annotation . stats [ "crossingLineCounts" ]) AS lines
FROM
` PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . TABLE_NAME ` AS t )
SELECT
nested . ingestion_time ,
JSON_QUERY_ARRAY ( line [ "positiveDirectionCounts" ]) AS entities
FROM
nested ,
UNNEST ( nested . lines ) AS line
WHERE
JSON_VALUE ( line . annotation . id ) = " LINE_ANNOTATION_ID " )
SELECT
ingestion_time ,
entity
FROM
nested2 ,
UNNEST ( nested2 . entities ) AS entity )
SELECT
STRING ( TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( nested3 . ingestion_time , MINUTE , " America/Los_Angeles " ), " America/Los_Angeles " ) AS time ,
IFNULL ( INT64 ( nested3 . entity [ "count" ]), 0 ) AS vehicle_count
FROM
nested3
WHERE
JSON_VALUE ( nested3 . entity [ "entity" ][ "labelString" ]) = "Vehicle" )
SELECT
time ,
SUM ( vehicle_count )
FROM
nested4
GROUP BY
time
Run your query
After you format your Google Standard SQL query, you can use the
console to run your query:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
Select arrow_drop_down Expand
next to you dataset name, and select your table name.
In the table detail view, click
add_box Compose new query .
Enter a Google Standard SQL query in the Query editor text area.
For example queries, see sample queries .
Optional: To change the data processing location, click More , then
Query settings . Under Processing location , click Auto-select and
choose your data's location . Finally, click
Save to update the query settings.
Click Run .
This creates a query job that writes the output to a temporary table.
Cloud Run functions integration
You can use Cloud Run functions triggering additional data processing with your
customized BigQuery ingestion.
To use Cloud Run functions for your customized BigQuery ingestion, do
the following:
When using the Google Cloud console, select the corresponding cloud function from
the dropdown menu of each connected model.
When using the Vertex AI Vision API, add one key-value pair to the
cloud_function_mapping field of BigQueryConfig in the
BigQuery node. The key is the BigQuery node
name and value is the http trigger of the target function.
To use Cloud Run functions with your customized BigQuery ingestion, the
function must meet the following requirements:
The Cloud Run functions instance has to be created before you create the
BigQuery node.
Vertex AI Vision API expects to receive an
AppendRowsRequest annotation returned from
Cloud Run functions.
You must set the proto_rows.writer_schema field for
all CloudFunction responses ; write_stream can be ignored.
Cloud Run functions integration example
The following example shows how to parse occupancy count node output
( OccupancyCountPredictionResult ), and
extract from it an ingestion_time , person_count , and vehicle_count table
schema.
The result of the following sample is a BigQuery table with the schema:
[
{
"name" : "ingestion_time" ,
"type" : "TIMESTAMP" ,
"mode" : "REQUIRED"
},
{
"name" : "person_count" ,
"type" : "INTEGER" ,
"mode" : "NULLABLE"
},
{
"name" : "vehicle_count" ,
"type" : "INTEGER" ,
"mode" : "NULLABLE"
},
]
Use the following code to create this table:
Define a proto (for example, test_table_schema.proto ) for table fields you
want to write:
syntax = "proto3" ;
package visionai . testing ;
message TestTableSchema {
int64 ingestion_time = 1 ;
int32 person_count = 2 ;
int32 vehicle_count = 3 ;
}
Compile the proto file to generate the protocol buffer Python file:
protoc -I=./ --python_out=./ ./test_table_schema.proto
Import the generated Python file and write the cloud function.
Python
import base64
import sys
from flask import jsonify
import functions_framework
from google.protobuf import descriptor_pb2
from google.protobuf.json_format import MessageToDict
import test_table_schema_pb2
def table_schema ():
schema = descriptor_pb2 . DescriptorProto ()
test_table_schema_pb2 . DESCRIPTOR . message_types_by_name [
'TestTableSchema' ] . CopyToProto ( schema )
return schema
def bigquery_append_row_request ( row ):
append_row_request = {}
append_row_request [ 'protoRows' ] = {
'writerSchema' : {
'protoDescriptor' : MessageToDict ( table_schema ())
},
'rows' : {
'serializedRows' :
base64 . b64encode ( row . SerializeToString ()) . decode ( 'utf-8' )
}
}
return append_row_request
@functions_framework . http
def hello_http ( request ):
request_json = request . get_json ( silent = False )
annotations = []
payloads = []
if request_json and 'annotations' in request_json :
for annotation_with_timestamp in request_json [ 'annotations' ]:
row = test_table_schema_pb2 . TestTableSchema ()
row . person_count = 0
row . vehicle_count = 0
if 'ingestionTimeMicros' in annotation_with_timestamp :
row . ingestion_time = int (
annotation_with_timestamp [ 'ingestionTimeMicros' ])
if 'annotation' in annotation_with_timestamp :
annotation = annotation_with_timestamp [ 'annotation' ]
if 'stats' in annotation :
stats = annotation [ 'stats' ]
for count in stats [ 'fullFrameCount' ]:
if count [ 'entity' ][ 'labelString' ] == 'Person' :
if 'count' in count :
row . person_count = count [ 'count' ]
elif count [ 'entity' ][ 'labelString' ] == 'Vehicle' :
if 'count' in count :
row . vehicle_count = count [ 'count' ]
payloads . append ( bigquery_append_row_request ( row ))
for payload in payloads :
annotations . append ({ 'annotation' : payload })
return jsonify ( annotations = annotations )
To include your dependencies in Cloud Run functions, you must also
upload the generated test_table_schema_pb2.py file and specify
requirements.txt similar to the following:
functions - framework == 3 .*
click == 7.1 . 2
cloudevents == 1.2 . 0
deprecation == 2.1 . 0
Flask == 1.1 . 2
gunicorn == 20.0 . 4
itsdangerous == 1.1 . 0
Jinja2 == 2.11 . 2
MarkupSafe == 1.1 . 1
pathtools == 0.1 . 2
watchdog == 1.0 . 2
Werkzeug == 1.0 . 1
protobuf == 3.12 . 2
Deploy the cloud function and set the corresponding http trigger in the
BigQueryConfig .
