Create and update a Batch Video Warehouse
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Create a Batch Video Warehouse that is ready to use for search.
Setting up a minimal Batch Video Warehouse
There are two common ways to set up a minimal Batch Video Warehouse.
Option 1: Deploy an empty index first, and then gradually add video assets.
The typical API sequence for this approach is as follows:
Set up a corpus: CreateCorpus , then CreateDataSchema .
Set up an empty index: CreateIndex , CreateIndexEndpoint , and DeployIndex .
Add video assets: CreateAsset , UploadAsset , AnalyzeAsset , and IndexAsset .
(Optional) Add video annotations: CreateAnnotation .
Option 2: Import video assets first, and then deploy an index.
The typical API sequence for this approach is as follows:
Set up a corpus: CreateCorpus , then CreateDataSchema .
Add video assets: CreateAsset , UploadAsset , and AnalyzeAsset .
(Optional) Add video annotations: CreateAnnotation .
Set up an index with existing assets:
CreateIndex , CreateIndexEndpoint , and DeployIndex .
Choosing an approach :
The best approach for you will depend on your specific needs. If you need to
start searching videos as soon as possible, you may want to use the first approach.
If you have a large number of videos to import, you may want to use the latter option.
Create a corpus
To begin, you must create a corpus resource. When creating a Batch Video Warehouse
corpus, specify EMBEDDING_SEARCH as the default value of the searchCapabilitySetting property.
REST & CMD LINE
Creates a corpus resource under the given project with the option to
specify the corpus's display name and description.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
REGIONALIZED_ENDPOINT : Endpoint might include a prefix matching the LOCATION_ID such
as europe-west4- . See more about
regionalized endpoints .
PROJECT_NUMBER : Your Google Cloud
project number .
LOCATION_ID : The region where you are using
Vertex AI Vision. For example: us-central1 , europe-west4 . See available regions .
DISPLAY_NAME : Display name for the warehouse.
WAREHOUSE_DESCRIPTION : The description of the warehouse ( corpus ).
HTTP method and URL:
POST https:// warehouse-visionai.googleapis.com /v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION_ID /corpora

which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,

Create, upload, and analyze assets
To add a video to Batch Video Warehouse, first create an asset.
REST & CMD LINE
To create an asset resource, send a POST request by using the
projects.locations.corpora.assets.create
method.

Vertex AI Vision. For example: us-central1 , europe-west4 . See available regions .
CORPUS_ID : The ID of your target corpus.
ASSET_ID : (Optional) A user-provided value for the asset ID. In this request, the
value is added to the request URL in the form:
https:// ENDPOINT /v1/ [...] /corpora/ CORPUS_ID /assets ?asset_id= ASSET_ID
TIME_TO_LIVE : The amount of time to live (TTL) for all assets under a corpus, or
the TTL of a specific asset. For example, for a corpus with assets with a TTL of 100 days,
provide the value 8640000 (seconds).

The UploadAsset API only verifies video metadata to make sure no quotas or
limits are violated.

use the projects.locations.corpora.assets.operations.get method to poll
operation status.
Create data schemas

and search for the metadata. Each data schema has a unique
key, which is to be associated with annotations and used as filter criteria in
search.

Note: Creating an index endpoint or deploying an index are long-running operations.
You can use the projects.locations.indexEndpoints.operations.get method to poll
operation status.
Streaming update assets in index
You can use the IndexAsset or RemoveIndexAsset methods to update or
