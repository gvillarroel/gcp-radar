Morphology & Dependency Trees
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The analyzeSyntax method returns details about the linguistic structure of the
given text. For each token in
the text, the Natural Language API provides information about its internal
structure (morphology) and its role in the sentence (syntax).
Morphology is the
study of the internal structure of words.. Morphology focuses on how the
components within a word (stems, root words, prefixes, suffixes, etc.) are
arranged or modified to create different meanings. English, for example, often
adds "-s" or "-es" to the end of count nouns to indicate plurality, and a "-d"
or "-ed" to a verb to indicate past tense. The suffix “-ly” is added to
adjectives to create adverbs (for example, “happy” [adjective] and “happily”
[adverb]).
The Natural Language API uses morphological analysis to infer grammatical
information about words.
Morphology varies greatly between languages. In languages such
as Russian, word endings indicate the role of a word in a sentence (for
example, “книга” [book - nominative case] becomes “книгу” [accusative case]
when it’s the direct object of a verb). This means word order can vary without
changing the meaning of the sentence, though different word order does impact
contextual appropriateness. Languages such as English and Mandarin, which both
lack affixes indicating case, rely more on the word order in a sentence to
indicate the respective roles of words. As a result, morphological analysis
depends heavily on the source language, and an understanding of what is
supported within that language.
Syntax is the study of the structure of
phrases and sentences. Syntax and morphology work together to indicate
grammatical relationships, with different languages dividing the labor between
them differently. For example, Russian uses an affix to indicate
the role of direct object (“у” in “книгу”), whereas English uses word order,
where the direct object follows the verb (read the book).
The analyzeSyntax response returns morphological information in the partOfSpeech
field and the syntactic relationship between words in the dependencyTree field.
Parts of Speech
Within a syntactic request, part-of-speech and morphological information are
returned within the response's partOfSpeech field. The partOfSpeech field
contains a set of sub-fields with Part-of-Speech (POS) information as well
as more explicit morphological information. These subfields are listed below.
tag denotes the part of speech using a coarse-grained POS tag
(NOUN, VERB, etc.), and provides top-level surface syntax information.
POS tags are helpful if you want to create patterns and/or reduce
ambiguity for subsequent language analysis (for example, “train”
tagged as a NOUN versus a VERB).
number denotes a word's
grammatical number .
In English, the suffix "-s" is added to
count nouns
to indicate more than one (for example, “dog+s” indicates more than one dog).
Absence of the plural suffix is often referred to as the singular form. Some
languages, such as Arabic, have the notion of a
dual number
as well. This field may contain the following values:
SINGULAR denotes one quantity.
PLURAL denotes more than one quantity.
DUAL denotes precisely two quantities.
person identifies a word's
grammatical person . In
English, “I/me” is 1st person singular and references the speaker (or writer)
of the expression, whereas “you” and “she/her and he/him” reference the
intended addressee (hearer) and some other person, respectively. This field
may contain the following values:
FIRST person denotes the speaker.
SECOND person denotes intended addressee, that is, the person spoken to.
THIRD person denotes non-speaker/non-hearer.
REFLEXIVE_PERSON indicates, for example, the subject and the object
reference the same entity, as in “The cat licked itself,” where -self
attaches to a pronoun to indicate reflexivity. In Russian and Japanese,
the reflexive is a standalone pronoun. (for example, “John loves himself”
in Russian is “Джон любит себя” where себя is gender neutral “self”; in
Japanese it’s “Tarō wa zibun o aisuru” (Romanized version) where “zibun”
is gender neutral “self.” See reflexive pronoun .
gender denotes a noun's
grammatical gender . This
field may contain the following values:
The FEMININE grammatical gender
The MASCULINE grammatical gender
The NEUTER grammatical gender
case denotes a word's
grammatical case and its
role in a phrase or
sentence. This field may contain the following values::
The ACCUSATIVE case
indicates the direct object of a transitive verb.
The ADVERBIAL case
indicates an adverbial form of an adjective. Note that English uses
separate words adverbs ("well") and adjectives ("good").
The suffix -ly in English does derive adverbs from adjectives (for
example, “happy,” “happily”), though it’s not considered a “case”.
The COMPLEMENTIVE case (Chinese) indicates a word necessary to complete
the meaning of a potential, descriptive, or resultative expression using
a conjunctive particle.
The DATIVE case indicates
an indirect object, which refers to the referent receiving the direct
object. In English, the indirect object is often indicated by the
preposition "to" as in the phrase "He gave the ball to Bobby," where
“Bobby” is the indirect object, and is the recipient of the ball. Whereas
in this Russian example: Иван дал книгу маше (Ivan gave the book to Masha),
“-e” indicates “маше” is the indirect object, and Masha is the recipient of
the book.
The GENITIVE case
indicates possession. Note that English often indicates possession using
the "-'s" affix instead of using a genitive case. The "-'s" affix can
can attach to the end of a phrase (for example, “[The man who ran
the bill up]’s wife paid a dear price for his excess.”). Whereas in this
Russian example, “-а” marks “Антон-” as genitive: “Где книга Антона?”
(Where is Anton’s book). In Russian, the genitive case also shows up as
the complement of words like “several,” “few.” For example:
Зимой здесь мало снега (“In winter there is little snow here”) “-a” marks
“снег-” (snow) as genitive, since it is the complement of “мало”
(“little”). There is no possession involved.
The INSTRUMENTAL case
indicates whether a noun is the instrument by which an action is
completed. In Russian, the English sentence, "He opened the door with a
key," would be: “он открыл дверь ключом” where “-om” attaches to “ключ”
(key) indicating instrumental case.
The LOCATIVE case
indicates a word's use to refer to a location. English, does not have a
locative case.
The NOMINATIVE case
is associated with the subject of a verb. In English, the subject of a
sentence is indicated through word order, not case. In the sentence,
“The girl won the race,” the phrase “the girl” is the subject, appearing
to the left of the verb, “won.” In Russian, девушка (the/a girl) can appear
either before or after the verb: “девушка выиграла гонку” or “гонку выиграла
девушка”, where the verb is выиграла (won).
The OBLIQUE case indicates
a word's use as an object to either a verb or preposition.
The PARTITIVE case
indicates a word's "partialness" or lack of specific identity. An example
of a partitive in English would be “three of my friends.” In Russian,
this would be “трое моих друзей” where “трое” is “three of” (compare with
“три друга” where “три” is “three”).
The PREPOSITIONAL case
indicates the object of a preposition.
The REFLEXIVE_CASE indicates the identity of an object of a verb to its
subject. Most languages do not use a reflexive case, as this usage is
indicated through use of special reflexive pronouns instead (such as
"himself", "myself", etc.")
The RELATIVE_CASE (Chinese) indicates the complementizer of a relative
clause connecting a noun with a verb or adjective. Examples: 工作 [的] 地方
(work [] place :: "place [where I] work"). 便宜 的 餐馆 (inexpensive []
restaurants :: restaurants [that are] inexpensive).
The VOCATIVE case
indicates a noun being used to address someone or something, usually when
spoken to.
tense denotes a verb's
grammatical tense , which
indicates the verb's reference to a position in time. Note that tense is
distinct from aspect , which also deals with a verb's relationship to time,
but focuses on the characteristics of that time flow, rather than its
position. The IMPERFECT and PLUPERFECT tenses in many languages more
accurately refer to specific combinations of tense and aspect. This field may
contain the following values:
CONDITIONAL_TENSE is an alternate term for the more prevalent
morphological term of "conditional mood." (See CONDITIONAL_MOOD
below.)
FUTURE denotes an action
taking place in the future. Note that in English, the future tense is most
often denoted by adding the word "will" to a verb phrase.
PAST denotes an action
taking place in the past.
PRESENT denotes an
action taking place in the present.
IMPERFECT denotes an action
taking place in the past, but which was not completed at that tense's
frame of reference. Note that in English, the imperfect tense is most
often denoted by adding a gerund form of a verb to the past tense as in
"I was walking." An imperfect tense event takes place in the past,
but is not completed relative to that past tense.
PLUPERFECT denotes an
action that has taken place in the past, and was also completed at that
tense's frame of reference. For example, "I had walked" takes place in the
past, but was also complete during the past tense's frame of reference.
aspect denotes a verb's
grammatical aspect , its
expression of time flow. Unlike tense , which focuses on a verb's position
within time, aspect focuses on the characteristics of that time flow where
it occurs. This field may contain the following values:
The PERFECTIVE aspect
denotes an event that is "completed" either because it has completely
happened in the past or will completely happen in the future.
The IMPERFECTIVE aspect
denotes an event that is incomplete, either because it is continuous or
because it is repeated.
The
PROGRESSIVE aspect
denotes an event that is continuous. A progressive aspect is generally
treated as a special case of the more general imperfective aspect (which
also covers repetition).
mood denotes a verb's
grammatical mood , which
indicates attitude about an underlying action. This field may contain the
following values:
CONDITIONAL_MOOD
indicates an action which is contingent. Note that in English, verb forms
are not conditional; instead, conditional behavior is noted through use
of the word "would" combined with the verb's infinitive.
IMPERATIVE indicates
a command or request through the second person.
INDICATIVE indicates
a statement of fact, more generally known as a "realis mood."
INTERROGATIVE
indicates a question.
JUSSIVE indicates a
command or request through either the first or third person. English does
not have a jussive mood, though exhortations that begin with a real or
implied "Let us" convey this jussive mood.
SUBJUNCTIVE
indicates a quality of uncertainty related to an action, also known as an
"irrealis" mood (contrasted with the "realis" indicative mood). English
does not have a specific subjunctive mood; instead, words such as "want",
"wish", "hope", etc. convey the import of the subjunctive mood.
voice denotes a verb's
grammatical voice , the
relationship between an action and a subject and/or object. This field may
contain the following values:
ACTIVE voice indicates
an action whose subject is performing the action.
CAUSATIVE voice indicates
an action whose effect is being performed on the subject.
In English, no direct causative voice exists; instead, such causation is
indicated through use of the verb "make", as in "Mom made me go to
school."
PASSIVE voice indicates
an action whose effect is being performed on the subject. In many cases,
a passive "agent" is unspoken or unknown.
reciprocity denotes a word's (typically a pronoun's)
reciprocity , indicating
the pronoun refers to a noun phrase elsewhere within the sentence. This field
may contain the following values:
RECIPROCAL indicates the pronoun is reciprocal.
NON_RECIPROCAL indicates the pronoun is not reciprocal.
proper denotes whether a noun is part of a proper name. Note that many
proper names consist of several words; if this phrase is detected as a proper
name, each token will be detected as proper as well. (For example, both
"Wrigley" and "Field" in the proper name "Wrigley Field" will have their
proper attribute set to PROPER . This field may contain the following values:
PROPER denotes that the token is part of a proper name.
NOT_PROPER denotes that the token is not part of a proper name.
form denotes additional morphological forms that don't neatly fit into
the previous set of common forms ( tense , mood , person , etc.) Most of
these forms are specific to unique languages. This field may contain the
following values:
ADNOMIAL (Korean/Japanese) indicates a word ending (Korean) or verb
(Japanese) that modifies a noun phrase. Examples: 밥을 먹는 사람 [someone
who eats rice] and 書く人 [someone who writes].
AUXILIARY (Korean) indicates a word ending that connects two adjacent
main and auxiliary predicates: 밥을 먹게 하다 [make (someone) to eat]
COMPLEMENTIZER (Korean) indicates a word ending that connects two or
more different clauses: 밥을 먹고 물을 마신다 [ (I) eat rice and drink water]
FINAL_ENDING (Korean/Japanese) indicates a word ending that finalizes
the clause or sentence coming at the end of the clause or sentence.
Examples: 밥을 먹는다 [(I) eat rice] and 手紙を書く [write a letter].
GERUND (Korean/Japanese) indicates a word ending that nominalizes verbs
or adjectives: (Korean) 밥 먹기 [eating rice] or connects verbs with various
auxiliary verbs: (Japanese) 書きたい [want to write]
REALIS (Japanese) indicates conditional and subjunctive forms with
a conjunctive particle “ば”: 書けば [if (I) write].
IRREALIS (Japanese) indicates connecting verbs with negative, passive,
or causative auxiliary verbs: 書かない [do not write], 書かれる [to be
written], 書かせる [make (someone) write].
ORDER (Japanese) indicates a command verb, similar to imperitive: 書け!
[write!]
SPECIFIC (Japanese) indicates special forms that cannot be covered by
the six categories above. The most common use of this form is a derivation
of a noun from an adjective by adding a suffix to the form: かわいさ
[cuteness]
SHORT (Russian) indicates a
short-form adjective or participle .
LONG (Russian) indicates a long-form adjective or participle, as
distinct from the above SHORT form.
Note that the Natural Language API provides morphological information on a
per-token basis (not per phrase). Morphological constructs that cross word
boundaries may not be supported.
Dependency trees
Within a syntactic request, part-of-speech and morphological information are
returned within the response's partOfSpeech field.
For each sentence within the text provided to the Natural Language API for
syntactic analysis, the API constructs a dependency tree that describes the
syntactic structure of that sentence. The syntactic information are returned within
the response's dependencyEdge field.
A diagram of the dependency tree for this single sentence from
John F. Kennedy's Inaugural speech
appears below:
For each token, the dependencyEdge element identifies which other token it modifies
(in the headTokenIndex field) and the syntactic relationship between this token
and its head token (in the label field). For example, here is the dependencyEdge element for the token "your" in
(the first occurrence of) the phrase "your country":
"dependencyEdge" : {
"headTokenIndex" : 4 ,
"label" : "POSS"
},
This element indicates that "your" modifies the fifth token ( headTokenIndex uses
a zero-based offset) and that it is a possessive modifier.
Every dependency tree includes a ROOT element ( "label": ROOT ), which corresponds to
the main verb in the sentence. In the above example, the ROOT element happens to
be the first word in the sentence ( "headTokenIndex": 0 ). For the ROOT word "Ask",
the headTokenIndex is its own index.
Although parse trees do not cross sentence boundaries, the Natural Language API
indexes sentences and tokens using zero-based offset values within the text as a whole.
The Natural Language API labels syntactic relationships using a common set of
dependencies that apply across the supported languages .
The labels are described below. In example text, "Head" and the label appear below the tokens
to which they apply.
