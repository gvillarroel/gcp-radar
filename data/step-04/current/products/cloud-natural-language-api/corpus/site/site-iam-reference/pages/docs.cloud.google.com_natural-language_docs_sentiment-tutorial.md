Sentiment Analysis Tutorial
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Audience
This tutorial is designed to let you quickly start exploring
and developing applications with the Google Cloud Natural Language API. It is
designed for people familiar with basic programming, though even without much
programming knowledge, you should be able to follow along. Having walked through
this tutorial, you should be able to use the
Reference documentation to create your own
basic applications.
This tutorial steps through a Natural Language API application using Python
code. The purpose here is not to explain the Python client libraries, but to
explain how to make calls to the Natural Language API. Applications in Java
and Node.js are essentially similar. Consult the Natural Language API
Samples for samples in other languages (including this sample within
the tutorial).
Prerequisites
This tutorial has several prerequisites:
You have a Google Cloud account. If you're new to the platform,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run,
test, and deploy workloads.
You've set up a Cloud Natural Language API project in the Google Cloud console.
You've set up your environment using
Application Default Credentials .
You have basic familiarity with Python programming.
You have set up your Python development environment. It is recommended that you have
the latest version of Python, pip , and virtualenv installed on your system.
For instructions, see the
Python Development Environment Setup Guide
for Google Cloud Platform.
You've installed the Google Cloud Client Library for Python
Analyzing document sentiment
This tutorial walks you through a basic Natural Language API application, using
an analyzeSentiment request, which performs sentiment analysis on text.
Sentiment analysis attempts to determine the overall attitude (positive or
negative) and is represented by numerical score and magnitude values.
(For more information on these concepts, consult
Natural Language Basics .)
We'll show the entire code first. (Note that we have removed most comments from
this code in order to show you how brief it is. We'll provide more comments as
we walk through the code.)
Note: To copy the code to your clipboard, click the copy widget that appears in
the top-right of the code snippet when you mouseover the code snippet. Copy this
code into a sentiment_analysis.py file within your development directory.
For more information on installing and using the Google Cloud Natural Language Client Library
for Python, see Natural Language API Client Libraries .
"""Demonstrates how to make a simple call to the Natural Language API."""
import argparse
from google.cloud import language_v1
def print_result ( annotations ):
score = annotations . document_sentiment . score
magnitude = annotations . document_sentiment . magnitude
for index , sentence in enumerate ( annotations . sentences ):
sentence_sentiment = sentence . sentiment . score
print ( f "Sentence { index } has a sentiment score of { sentence_sentiment } " )
print ( f "Overall Sentiment: score of { score } with magnitude of { magnitude } " )
return 0
def analyze ( movie_review_filename ):
"""Run a sentiment analysis request on text within a passed filename."""
client = language_v1 . LanguageServiceClient ()
with open ( movie_review_filename ) as review_file :
# Instantiates a plain text document.
content = review_file . read ()
document = language_v1 . Document (
content = content , type_ = language_v1 . Document . Type . PLAIN_TEXT
)
annotations = client . analyze_sentiment ( request = { "document" : document })
# Print the results
print_result ( annotations )
if __name__ == "__main__" :
parser = argparse . ArgumentParser (
description = __doc__ , formatter_class = argparse . RawDescriptionHelpFormatter
)
parser . add_argument (
"movie_review_filename" ,
help = "The filename of the movie review you'd like to analyze." ,
)
args = parser . parse_args ()
analyze ( args . movie_review_filename )
This simple application performs the following tasks:
Imports the libraries necessary to run the application
Takes a text file and passes it to the main() function
Reads the text file and makes a request to the service
Parses the response from the service and displays it to the user
We'll go over these steps in more detail below.
Importing libraries
For more information on installing and using the Google Cloud Natural Language Client Library
for Python, see Natural Language API Client Libraries .
import argparse
from google.cloud import language_v1
We import argparse , a standard library, to allow the application to accept
input filenames as arguments.
For using the Cloud Natural Language API, we'll also want to import the
language module from the google-cloud-language library. The types module
contains classes that are required for creating requests.
Running your application
if __name__ == "__main__" :
parser = argparse . ArgumentParser (
description = __doc__ , formatter_class = argparse . RawDescriptionHelpFormatter
)
parser . add_argument (
"movie_review_filename" ,
help = "The filename of the movie review you'd like to analyze." ,
)
args = parser . parse_args ()
analyze ( args . movie_review_filename )
Here, we simply parse the passed argument for the text filename and pass it to
the analyze() function.
Authenticating to the API
Before communicating with the Natural Language API service, you need to
authenticate your service using previously acquired credentials. Within an
application, the simplest way to obtain credentials is to use
Application Default Credentials
(ADC). By default, ADC will attempt to obtain credentials from the
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment file, which should be set to point
to your service account's JSON key file. (You should have set up your service
account and environment to use ADC in the Quickstart . See
Setting Up a Service Account
for more information.)
The Google Cloud Client Library for Python automatically uses the application
default credentials.
Making the request
Now that our Natural Language API service is ready, we can access the service by calling the analyze_sentiment method of the LanguageServiceClient instance.
The client library encapsulates the details for requests and responses to the API. See the
Natural Language API Reference for complete
information on the specific structure of such a request.
For more information on installing and using the Google Cloud Natural Language Client Library
for Python, see Natural Language API Client Libraries .
def analyze ( movie_review_filename ):
"""Run a sentiment analysis request on text within a passed filename."""
client = language_v1 . LanguageServiceClient ()
with open ( movie_review_filename ) as review_file :
# Instantiates a plain text document.
content = review_file . read ()
document = language_v1 . Document (
content = content , type_ = language_v1 . Document . Type . PLAIN_TEXT
)
annotations = client . analyze_sentiment ( request = { "document" : document })
# Print the results
print_result ( annotations )
This code snippet performs the following tasks:
Instantiates a LanguageServiceClient instance as the client.
Reads the filename containing the text data into a variable.
Instantiates a Document object with the contents of the file.
Calls the client's analyze_sentiment method.
Parsing the response
def print_result ( annotations ):
score = annotations . document_sentiment . score
magnitude = annotations . document_sentiment . magnitude
for index , sentence in enumerate ( annotations . sentences ):
sentence_sentiment = sentence . sentiment . score
print ( f "Sentence { index } has a sentiment score of { sentence_sentiment } " )
print ( f "Overall Sentiment: score of { score } with magnitude of { magnitude } " )
return 0
We walk through the response to extract the sentiment score values for each
sentence, and the overall score and magnitude values for the entire review,
and display those to the user.
Run the sample
To run our sample, we'll test it on a set of (fake) movie reviews for the
movie "Bladerunner."
Download the samples from Google Cloud Storage:
gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-samples-tests/natural-language/sentiment-samples.tgz .
To install the latest version of Google Cloud CLI, refer to
gcloud CLI documentation .
Unzip those samples, which will create a " reviews " folder:
gunzip sentiment-samples.tgz
tar -xvf sentiment-samples.tar
Run our sentiment analysis on one of the specified files:
python sentiment_analysis.py reviews/bladerunner-pos.txt
Sentence 0 has a sentiment score of 0.8
Sentence 1 has a sentiment score of 0.9
Sentence 2 has a sentiment score of 0.8
Sentence 3 has a sentiment score of 0.2
Sentence 4 has a sentiment score of 0.1
Sentence 5 has a sentiment score of 0.4
Sentence 6 has a sentiment score of 0.3
Sentence 7 has a sentiment score of 0.4
Sentence 8 has a sentiment score of 0.2
Sentence 9 has a sentiment score of 0.9
Overall Sentiment: score of 0.5 with magnitude of 5.5
The above example would indicate a review that was relatively positive
(score of 0.5 ), and relatively emotional (magnitude of 5.5 ).
Running analysis on the other examples should produce values similar to those
shown below:
python sentiment_analysis.py reviews/bladerunner-neg.txt
...
Overall Sentiment: score of -0.6 with magnitude of 3.3
python sentiment_analysis.py reviews/bladerunner-mixed.txt
...
Overall Sentiment: score of 0 with magnitude of 4.7
python sentiment_analysis.py reviews/bladerunner-neutral.txt
...
Overall Sentiment: score of -0.1 with magnitude of 1.8
Note that the magnitudes are all similar (indicating a relative equal amount
of emotionally significant sentiment) except for the "neutral" case, which
indicates a review with not very much emotional sentiment, either positive or
negative. (For more information
on sentiment scores and magnitude, and how to interpret these values, see
Interpreting Sentiment Analysis Values .)
If you wish to explore sentiment analysis with more data, Stanford provides a
dataset of IMDB movie reviews. To
retrieve these movie reviews:
Download the Large Movie Review
dataset .
Unzip the file into your working directory. The movie reviews are divided
into pos and neg directories within train and test data directories,
with each text file containing one movie review.
Run the sentiment_analysis.py tool on any of the movie review text files.
Congratulations! You've performed your first inference tasks using the Google
Cloud Natural Language API!
