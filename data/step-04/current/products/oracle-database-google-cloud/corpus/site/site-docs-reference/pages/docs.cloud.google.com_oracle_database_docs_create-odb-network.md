Create ODB Network and ODB Subnets
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create an ODB Network and ODB Subnets
in Google Cloud.
An ODB Network provides connectivity between Oracle Database@Google Cloud resources
in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) child site and your Google Cloud
VPC network. The ODB Network maps OCI network resources, such as Virtual Cloud
Networks (VCNs), and their related subnets back to Google Cloud.
When you create an ODB Network, Oracle Database@Google Cloud automatically
provisions all of the underlying components that are required to establish this
connectivity. This includes the VCN, subnets, DNS zones, and the other objects
that maintain the private connection between Google Cloud and the OCI
child site.
Oracle Database@Google Cloud also lets you create up to five ODB Subnets
within an ODB Network for the ease of network management.
Before you begin
Make sure that you have the required Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and
permissions to create an ODB Network and ODB Subnets
as described in Deploy Oracle Database@Google Cloud environment .
Create an ODB Network
An ODB Network must be created in the Google Cloud project that is
associated to the billing account that you used for your marketplace order. In
the case of a Shared VPC deployment, this project is also your host
project and contains the Shared VPC network as well.
You must create the ODB Network in the same region and zone
where you plan to create your Exadata Infrastructure, Exadata VM Cluster, or DB system.
This ensures optimal performance and seamless communication.
To create an ODB Network, do the following:
Console
Go to the ODB Network page.
Go to ODB Network
Click Create .
From the Associated network list, select a VPC network which you want
to associate with the ODB Network.
Select a Region and a GCP Oracle zone .
The region and zone choice is permanent and can't be changed later. If
you aren't sure about which zone to select, you can select Any and
Google Cloud automatically chooses a zone for you.
Enter a name for the ODB network.
Click Create .
gcloud
Use the gcloud oracle-database odb-networks create
command to create an ODB Network.
gcloud oracle-database odb-networks create ODB_NETWORK_ID \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION \
--network=projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ VPC_NETWORK
Replace the following:
ODB_NETWORK_ID : a unique identifier for your
ODB Network.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project in
which to create the ODB Network. If you're using a
Shared VPC, then this is the ID of your host project.
REGION : the region in which to create the
ODB Network.
VPC_NETWORK : the ID of the VPC network which you want to
associate with the ODB Network.
API
To create an ODB Network, run the following curl command:
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://oracledatabase.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /odbNetworks/ ODB_NETWORK_ID "
-d \
'{
"network": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ VPC_NETWORK ",
"gcp_oracle_zone": " GCP_ORACLE_ZONE "
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project in
which to create the ODB Network. If you're using a Shared VPC,
then this is the ID of your host project.
REGION : the region in which to create the ODB Network.
ODB_NETWORK_ID : a unique identifier for your ODB Network.
VPC_NETWORK : the ID of the VPC network which you want to
associate with the ODB Network.
GCP_ORACLE_ZONE : the GCP Oracle zone in which to create the
ODB Network.
After the ODB Network is created, you can create ODB Subnets.
Create an ODB Subnet
You can create two types of ODB Subnets:
Client ODB Subnets to connect to applications.
Backup ODB Subnets to back up database services.
For an ODB Network, you can create up to five ODB Subnets.
A single Client ODB Subnet can be used by both Autonomous AI Databases
and Exadata VM Clusters.
The number of ODB Subnets required depends on which service you
want to use:
A Exadata VM Cluster requires one client subnet and one backup subnet.
An Autonomous AI Database requires one client subnet.
To create a subnet, do the following:
Console
Go to the ODB Network page.
Go to ODB Network
Click the ODB Network for which you want to create the subnet.
On the ODB Network details page, go to the Subnets section,
and click Create .
On Create ODB Subnet page, do the following:
Enter a name for the subnet.
Enter a range for the subnet in CIDR notation.
Select the Subnet type .
Click Create .
gcloud
Use the gcloud oracle-database odb-networks odb-subnets create
command to create an ODB Subnet.
gcloud oracle-database odb-networks odb-subnets create ODB_SUBNET_ID \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION \
--odb-network= ODB_NETWORK_ID \
--cidr-range= CIDR_RANGE \
--purpose= PURPOSE
Replace the following:
ODB_SUBNET_ID : a unique identifier for your
ODB Subnet.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project in
which to create the ODB Network. If you're using a
Shared VPC, then this is the ID of your host project.
REGION : the region in which to create the
ODB Subnet.
ODB_NETWORK_ID : the ID of your ODB Network for
which you're creating the ODB Subnet.
CIDR_RANGE : To create a client subnet, provide the IPv4 address
or address range that can access your cluster. If you're creating a backup
subnet, then provide the IPv4 address or address range that serves as
backup to access your cluster.
Address ranges must use a valid
CIDR notation
(for example, 10.10.10.0/24).
PURPOSE : the type of the ODB Subnet that you want to
create. The accepted values are client_subnet or backup_subnet .
API
To create an ODB Subnet, run the following curl command:
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://oracledatabase.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /odbNetworks/ ODB_NETWORK_ID /odbSubnets/ ODB_SUBNET_ID "
-d \
'{
"cidr_range": " CIDR_RANGE ",
"purpose": " PURPOSE "
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
that contains your ODB Network for which you want to create an
ODB Subnet. If you're using a Shared VPC, then this is the
ID of your host project.
REGION : the region of your ODB Network.
ODB_NETWORK_ID : the ID of your ODB Network for which you're
creating the ODB Subnet.
ODB_SUBNET_ID : a unique identifier for your ODB Subnet.
CIDR_RANGE : To create a client subnet, provide the IPv4 address
or address range that can access your cluster. If you're creating a backup
subnet, then provide the IPv4 address or address range that serves as
backup to access your cluster.
Address ranges must use a valid CIDR notation
(for example, 10.10.10.0/24).
PURPOSE : the type of the ODB Subnet that you want to
create. The accepted values are client_subnet or backup_subnet .
