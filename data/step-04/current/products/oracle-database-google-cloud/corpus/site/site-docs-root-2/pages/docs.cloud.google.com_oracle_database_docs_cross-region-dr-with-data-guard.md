This page describes how you can use Oracle Autonomous Data Guard to set up
cross-region disaster recovery for your Autonomous AI Databases in Google Cloud.
Overview
Cross-region Autonomous Data Guard on Oracle Database@Google Cloud offers a powerful and
streamlined disaster recovery solution for Autonomous AI Database.
Protection is achieved by automatically replicating changes to a standby
Autonomous AI Database in a separate Oracle Database@Google Cloud region. This feature
enhances business continuity by protecting against regional outages and
minimizing data loss. Deploying Autonomous AI Database Serverless with
Autonomous Data Guard technology automates the complex processes involved in
disaster recovery, including setup, management, and monitoring Oracle Data Guard.
Autonomous Data Guard is managed by Oracle, providing the highest levels of data
protection combined with decades of database management experience.
A core benefit of this solution is its ability to minimize Recovery Point
Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). This is achieved through
real-time redo log replication to the standby database, ensuring
near-instantaneous data replication. In the event of a primary database failure,
automated failover capabilities facilitate a rapid transition to the standby
database, minimizing downtime. Furthermore, planned switchovers are supported
for maintenance activities, allowing for seamless transitions between primary
and standby roles. Data consistency is paramount, and this service ensures that
the standby database remains a synchronized, up-to-date copy of the primary
database through continuous redo application.
The architecture of cross-region Autonomous Data Guard is designed for
simplicity and reliability. You can enable this feature and specify the
chosen secondary region for the standby database after provisioning an
Autonomous AI Database on Oracle Database@Google Cloud. Then, Google Cloud and Oracle
automatically provision the standby database and configure the necessary data
replication settings. Operational management is simplified through
Google Cloud's monitoring tools, which let you track the health and status
of the Autonomous Data Guard configuration, including peer lag.
Switchovers, which are planned transitions between primary and standby roles,
can be initiated through the Google Cloud console or API. Failovers are performed
when a disaster leaves the primary database unavailable. Following a failover,
the failed primary database can be automatically reinstated as a standby
database once it is brought back online.
When implementing cross-region Autonomous Data Guard, several considerations are
important, such as the following:
Selecting a geographically distant secondary region to minimize the risk of
correlated failures.
Network latency between regions can impact peer database lag, so careful
planning is necessary.
Regular testing of failover and switchover procedures of both the application
and database tiers is crucial to ensure proper functionality.
Prerequisites
Typically known as standby databases in an on-premises deployment,
Autonomous Data Guard peer databases are added after a primary database has been
provisioned. Following are the prerequisites to create a peer databases with
Autonomous Data Guard:
A primary Autonomous AI Database instance.
A Google Cloud VPC network with global routing configured.
An active subscription to the region where the peer database is to be
provisioned.
Primary and peer databases must use private endpoints for database connectivity.
You can assign custom hostnames and IP addresses for the private endpoints
during peer database creation. If you don't choose to assign a custom hostname
or IP address, then these values are automatically generated.
The display name of the peer database is automatically generated during creation.
You can configure a custom database ID when using the Google Cloud CLI command to
create a peer database.
Example deployment
The following diagram shows an application running in Google Cloud's
us-east4 and us-west3 regions. The application servers run on Google Kubernetes Engine
and communicate with an Autonomous AI Database, named demodb1 .
Autonomous Data Guard, depicted by the green line, has been configured with a
peer database running in the us-west3 region.
Considerations
Consider the following points while setting up peer databases with Autonomous
Data Guard:
Primary and peer databases must be accessible from the same VPC network.
Peer databases in a separate region must use a CIDR range that doesn't overlap
with the CIDR range of the subnets in the associated VPC network or the subnets
used by the primary database.
The standby database is created with the same resource configuration (workload
type, ECPU count, and provisioned storage footprint) as the primary database.
Cross-region failover requires manual intervention - this is due to the complex
nature regional failover activities at the application layer.
Oracle Active Data Guard is not supported - the peer database can't be accessed
by database clients.
Autonomous Data Guard is available with the Lakehouse and Transaction
Processing workload types. Autonomous Data Guard is not available with the
JSON and APEX workload types.

Configuring database clients when Autonomous Data Guard is enabled
Single-region applications versus multi-region applications
Deciding when to run multi-region Oracle AI Database applications hinges on a
careful evaluation of your business requirements. Primarily, the need for
robust disaster recovery and high availability often dictates a multi-region
strategy. If your business can't tolerate significant downtime or data loss,
especially in the face of a regional outage, a multi-region deployment becomes
essential. This decision should be driven by clearly defined Recovery Time
Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
From a technical perspective, the application's architecture must be designed
to support multi-region deployments. This involves careful consideration of data
partitioning, load balancing, and failover mechanisms. Network latency between
regions is a critical factor, and optimizing network connectivity is crucial to
minimize performance impacts. In many cases, the database shouldn't failover
between regions without a corresponding application failover. Because of this,
cross-region failover operations with Autonomous Data Guard must be performed
manually. Thoroughly test failover and failback procedures to ensure the
robustness and predictability of the system during failure scenarios.
Database and application administrators have the option to configure database
clients to connect to an in-region copy of the database or for connectivity to
span regions.
Configure single-region database connectivity
Single-region connectivity can be configured using the same methods as you would
use for a database not protected by Autonomous Data Guard. In the
Example deployment , applications in us-east4 connect to
the database in the corresponding region. When a failover occurs, the applications
failover to the secondary region us-west3 .
You can retrieve your connection strings through the Google Cloud console or
through the gcloud CLI command:
gcloud oracle-database autonomous-databases describe demodb1 \
--location=us-east4 \
--format="json(properties.connectionStrings.profiles)" | \
jq -r '.properties.connectionStrings.profiles[] | select(.tlsAuthentication=="SERVER")'

}
Configuring multi-region database connectivity
Different database hostnames and connection strings are used for each database
in a cross-region configuration. When using mTLS for connectivity, you must
combine the database wallets into a single zip file.
You must manually configure the wallet file if you want to allow applications to
connect across regions through a single connection string.
To manually construct a wallet that contains both the primary and the remote
database connections strings, do the following:
Download the wallets for both the primary and standby databases from the
Google Cloud console.
Extract both wallet files and open the two tnsnames.ora files.
Copy the remote database's connect descriptor into the primary database's
connection string in the primary's tnsnames.ora file using your preferred
retry delays.
Zip the updated primary database wallet folder.
With this updated tnsnames.ora file, your primary database connection strings
in the updated wallet.zip contain both the primary and the standby hostnames,
to support failover.
An application using the updated wallet attempts to connect and retries
connecting to the first listed database hostname, and if that connection fails
due to the database being unavailable, the application then automatically
attempts to connect to the second database hostname.
For example, if your Autonomous Data Guard is setup with the primary in Ashburn
and a cross-region standby in Salt Lake City, Oracle recommends that your
mid-tier applications running in Ashburn use the connection string or wallet
from that of the primary database in Ashburn, and your corresponding applications
running in Phoenix use the connection string or wallet from that of the standby
database in Phoenix. For a regional failover or switchover, Oracle recommends
failing over both your database and your application or mid-tier, for optimum
performance and to minimize any cross-regional latency.
For example, combining the connection details for the demodb1 primary and standby
databases would result in the following connection string for the high
predefined service :
demodb1_high_adg =
(description_list=
(failover=on)
(load_balance=off)
(description=
(retry_count=15)
(retry_delay=3)
(address=
(protocol=tcps)
(port=1521)
(host=demodb1.adb.us-saltlake-2.oraclecloud.com)
)
(connect_data=
(service_name=g24da7e94756f60_demodb1_high.adb.oraclecloud.com)
)
(security=
(ssl_server_dn_match=no)
)
)
(description=
(retry_count=15)
(retry_delay=3)
(address=
(protocol=tcps)
(port=1521)
(host=demodb1.adb.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com)
)
(connect_data=
(service_name=g24da7e94756f60_demodb1_high.adb.oraclecloud.com)
)
(security=
(ssl_server_dn_match=no)
)
)
)
Initiation of applications connections with a multi-region connection string
may take slightly longer to complete. Applications select private endpoint
hostnames serially from the entries in the connection string in the order they
are listed. This does not affect session performance once the connection has
been established.
