Feature
Parameter Manager supports the latest identifier, which lets you fetch the
most recent parameter value without specifying a version ID. When you use the
gcloud CLI or REST API, you can use latest to retrieve the most recent version
of a parameter.
For more information, see Access a parameter version .
February 06, 2026
Feature
Parameter version comparison : You can compare two versions of a parameter to
identify changes in their payload. This feature lets you audit modifications over
time and debug issues related to specific parameter updates.
For more information, see Compare parameter versions .

Feature
Preview: Integrated secret synchronization feature is now available in preview. You can automatically synchronize secrets from Secret Manager into Kubernetes Secret objects within your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. This process allows applications to access secrets from Secret Manager using standard Kubernetes methods, such as environment variables or volume mounts. Applications that are already configured to read secrets from Kubernetes Secret object can now seamlessly read secrets in Secret Manager.
For more information, see Synchronize secrets to Kubernetes Secrets .
September 01, 2025
Feature
Automatic secret rotation with the Secret Manager add-on for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) : You can configure the Secret Manager add-on to automatically rotate secrets so that secrets updated in Secret Manager after initial pod deployment are automatically and periodically pushed to the pod. This feature is now Generally available (GA).
For more information, see Configure automatic rotation of secrets .
July 09, 2025
Feature
Enhanced tagging capabilities for Secret Manager : You can now add tags directly at the time of secret creation. This new feature lets you provide essential metadata for your resources and helps with better organization, cost tracking, and automated policy application from the time a secret is created. In addition to this, tagging for regional secrets is now fully supported, both during secret creation and for existing regional secrets. For more information, see the documentation on tags for global secrets and regional secrets .
Soft-enforced rate limits for modifying secrets and secret versions : We have introduced soft-enforced rate limits for the following operations in Secret Manager:
AddSecretVersion
UpdateSecret
EnableSecretVersion
DisableSecretVersion
DestroySecretVersion
Soft enforcement lets us continue serving requests beyond the defined quota as long as our backend systems can comfortably handle the increased load. For details, see the Quotas and limits documentation.

Feature
Delayed destruction of secret versions is now generally available (GA) . You can set up a duration for delayed destruction at the time of creating or updating a secret. When a destruction delay duration is configured for a secret, destroying a version of that secret will disable the version and prevent its use. However, it won't be immediately destroyed. Instead, it will remain scheduled for destruction for the specified delay duration. After that duration expires, the version will be permanently destroyed. Secret Manager administrators can restore a secret version that is scheduled for destruction by either enabling or disabling it during the delay period.

Feature
Preview: Delayed destruction of secret versions is now available in Preview. By default, secret versions are destroyed immediately upon request. You can enable delayed destruction at the secret level and provide a destruction delay duration such that when a version belonging to this secret is destroyed, the destruction is not immediate. Instead, the secret version is disabled for use and remains scheduled for destruction for the configured delay duration. When the destruction delay duration expires, the version is destroyed. The Secret Manager Admin can restore a secret version that is scheduled for destruction by enabling or disabling the version.
