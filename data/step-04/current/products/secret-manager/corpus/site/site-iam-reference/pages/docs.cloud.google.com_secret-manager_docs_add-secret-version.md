Add a secret version
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Secret data is immutable and most operations take place on secret versions. A
secret version contains the actual secret data, along with state and
metadata about the secret. This page describes how to add a secret version.
For more information about versioning, see this video
on versioning.
Important: To use Secret Manager with workloads running on
Compute Engine or Google Kubernetes Engine, the underlying instance or node must have
the cloud-platform OAuth scope. See
accessing the Secret Manager API
for more information.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to add a secret version,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on a secret:
Secret Manager Secret Version Adder ( roles/secretmanager.secretVersionAdder )
Secret Manager Secret Version Manager ( roles/secretmanager.secretVersionManager )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
IAM roles can't be granted on a secret version.
Add a secret version
To add a secret version, use one of the following methods:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Secret Manager page.
Go to Secret Manager
On the Secret Manager page, locate the secret for which you want
to add the new version.
Click the more_vert Actions
menu associated with that secret, and then click Add new version . The
Add new version dialog appears.
In the Secret value field, enter a value for the secret such as abcd1234 .
Alternatively, you can upload a file containing the secret value.
Click Add new version .
gcloud
Add a secret version from the contents of a file on disk
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
SECRET_ID : the ID of the secret
FILE_PATH : the full path (including file name) to the file containing the version details
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud secrets versions add SECRET_ID --data-file = " FILE_PATH "
Windows (PowerShell)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud secrets versions add SECRET_ID --data-file = " FILE_PATH "
Windows (cmd.exe)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud secrets versions add SECRET_ID --data-file = " FILE_PATH "
The response contains the newly created secret version.
Add a secret version directly on the command line
You can also add a secret version directly on the command line, but this is discouraged because it appears as plaintext in the list of processes and may be captured by other system users. Note that the command with the plaintext will also be in your shell history.
echo -n " SECRET_DATA " | \
gcloud secrets versions add SECRET_ID --data-file=-
Replace the following:
SECRET_DATA : the data that you want to store in the secret version
SECRET_ID : the ID of the secret or fully qualified identifier for the secret
Optional: Add a version from a file's contents when first creating a secret
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
SECRET_ID : the ID of the secret
FILE_PATH : the full path (including file name) to the file containing the version details
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud secrets create SECRET_ID --data-file = " FILE_PATH "
Windows (PowerShell)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud secrets create SECRET_ID --data-file = " FILE_PATH "
Windows (cmd.exe)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud secrets create SECRET_ID --data-file = " FILE_PATH "
The response contains the newly created secret version.
REST
Base64-encode the secret data and save it as a shell variable.
$ SECRET_DATA=$(echo "seCr3t" | base64)
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID
SECRET_ID : the ID of the secret
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://secretmanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /secrets/ SECRET_ID :addVersion
Request JSON body:
{"payload": {"data": "${SECRET_DATA}"}}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://secretmanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /secrets/ SECRET_ID :addVersion"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://secretmanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /secrets/ SECRET_ID :addVersion" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /secrets/ SECRET_ID /versions/1",
"createTime": "2024-03-25T08:24:13.153705Z",
"state": "ENABLED",
"etag": "\"161477e6071da9\""

Secret version states
A secret version can be in one of the following states at any given time:
Enabled - In this state, the secret version can be accessed and described.
This is the default state for a new secret version.
Disabled - In this state, the secret version cannot be accessed, but the
secret's contents still exist. The secret version can be
re-enabled to restore access.
Destroyed - In this state, the secret version's contents are
discarded. The secret version cannot be changed to another state.
You are billed for both enabled and disabled secret versions. You are
not billed for secret versions that are in the destroyed state.
