Enable customer-managed encryption keys for Secret Manager
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
By default, Secret Manager encrypts customer content at
rest. Secret Manager handles encryption for you without any
additional actions on your part. This option is called Google default encryption .
If you want to control your encryption keys, then you can use customer-managed encryption keys
(CMEKs) in Cloud KMS with CMEK-integrated services including
Secret Manager. Using Cloud KMS keys gives you control over their protection
level, location, rotation schedule, usage and access permissions, and cryptographic boundaries.
Using Cloud KMS also lets
you track key usage , view audit logs, and
control key lifecycles.
Instead of Google owning and managing the symmetric
key encryption keys (KEKs) that protect your data, you control and
manage these keys in Cloud KMS.
After you set up your resources with CMEKs, the experience of accessing your
Secret Manager resources is similar to using Google default encryption.
For more information about your encryption
options, see Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) .
Secret Manager provides tools
for storing, managing, and accessing sensitive data in your applications.
Caution: If you temporarily disable or permanently destroy the CMEK,
the data encrypted with that key cannot be decrypted and therefore is
unaccessible.
CMEK with Cloud KMS Autokey
You can either create CMEKs manually to protect your Secret Manager
resources or use Cloud KMS Autokey. With Autokey, key rings and keys are generated on demand to
support resource creation in Secret Manager.
Service agents that use the keys for encrypt and decrypt operations are created if they don't
already exist and are granted the required Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. For more
information, see Autokey overview .
Secret Manager is
only compatible with Cloud KMS Autokey when
creating resources using Terraform or the REST API.
To learn how to use
manually-created CMEKs to protect your Secret Manager resources, see
CMEK with automatic replication and CMEK with user
managed replication on this page.
To learn how to use CMEKs created by
Cloud KMS Autokey to protect your Secret Manager resources,
see Using Autokey with Secret Manager
resources .
How CMEK works in Secret Manager
Before writing a secret version to persistent storage in a particular location,
Secret Manager encrypts the data with a unique data encryption key
(DEK). This DEK is then encrypted with a replica-specific key, called a key
encryption key (KEK) that is owned by the Secret Manager service.
When using CMEK for Secret Manager, the KEK is called a CMEK key and is
a symmetric key you manage within Cloud KMS. The CMEK key must be in
the same Google Cloud location as the secret version replica it encrypts. You can also
use a Cloud EKM key in the CMEK policy for encryption and decryption.
This guide walks through how to configure Secret Manager to use CMEK.
For more information about CMEK in general, including when and why to enable it,
see the Cloud Key Management Service documentation .
Note: Secret Manager uses the primary Cloud KMS key version
for CMEK encryption. CMEK cannot be configured with a specific key version.
Key rotation
When you rotate a Cloud Key Management Service key, the new key version becomes the primary
version. Secret Manager uses the following logic for key rotation:
New secret versions created after the rotation automatically use the new
primary key version for encryption.
Existing secret versions aren't automatically re-encrypted.
Secret Manager can still access secret versions that were encrypted
with previous key versions as long as those key versions remain enabled. For
example, if you add a new version to a CMEK-protected secret and then rotate
the key, the original secret version is encrypted with its original key
version, and the new secret version is encrypted with the new key version.
Both secret versions are accessible.
Limitations
CMEK is available only in the Secret Manager
v1 API and
Google Cloud CLI.
Before you begin
You may choose to store all resources in the same project or to store secrets
and keys in separate projects. Read Cloud KMS Separation of
duties to better
understand this decision.
Complete the following prerequisites to set up Secret Manager and
Cloud KMS:
Secret Manager:
Create or use an existing project to hold your Secret Manager
resources.
If necessary, complete the steps in the
Configuring Secret Manager
section of the Secret Manager quickstart.
Cloud KMS:
Create or use an existing project to hold your Cloud KMS
resources.
If necessary,
enable the Cloud KMS API .
Set the following variables to the project IDs of your Secret Manager
and Cloud KMS projects.
This is an editable variable. Set it to your Secret Manager project ID and the
value will be used in all commands on this page.
SM_PROJECT_ID
This is an editable variable. Set it to your Cloud KMS project ID and the value
will be used in all commands on this page.
KMS_PROJECT_ID
Authenticate to Google Cloud:
gcloud
To use Secret Manager on the command line, first
Install or upgrade to version 378.0.0 or higher of the Google Cloud CLI .
On Compute Engine or GKE, you must
authenticate with the cloud-platform scope .
gcloud auth login
Note: Cloud KMS usage is subject to Cloud HSM and
Cloud EKM
additional quota limitations
depending on the type of CMEK key used. Secret Manager calls
Cloud KMS every time it performs a cryptographic operation. CMEK key
usage is billed to the Cloud KMS project.
Creating a service agent identity
Note: To create a service identity with the required permissions, you must have
resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy permission. This permission is included
in the Project Owner, Project IAM Admin, and Organization Administrator roles.
You need to create a service agent identity for each
project that requires customer-managed encryption keys.
To create a service identity with Google Cloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud
To use Secret Manager on the command line, first
Install or upgrade to version 378.0.0 or higher of the Google Cloud CLI .
On Compute Engine or GKE, you must
authenticate with the cloud-platform scope .
gcloud beta services identity create \
--service "secretmanager.googleapis.com" \
--project " SM_PROJECT_ID "
Which will return a service identity name in the following format:
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-secretmanager.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Save the service identity name:
The following variable is editable. Click on it to update the value, and it will
be reflected throughout this documentation page.
SM_SERVICE_IDENTITY
You will grant this service identity access to the CMEK Cloud KMS keys
used to encrypt and decrypt your secrets.
CMEK with automatic replication
This section covers secrets that are configured via an automatic replication
policy.
For secrets that use the automatic replication policy, your CMEK key must be
located in the global Cloud KMS multi-region. If you're using a
Cloud EKM key, you cannot configure your secret to use automatic
replication because Cloud EKM keys are not available in the global
region. To learn more about using Cloud EKM keys, see
Add a Cloud EKM key to a CMEK policy .
Create a symmetric Cloud KMS key in the global Cloud KMS
region, or use an existing key. This example creates a new key ring called
secret-manager-cmek , then creates a new key called my-cmek-key on it.
gcloud
To use Secret Manager on the command line, first
Install or upgrade to version 378.0.0 or higher of the Google Cloud CLI .
On Compute Engine or GKE, you must
authenticate with the cloud-platform scope .
gcloud kms keyrings create "secret-manager-cmek" \
--project " KMS_PROJECT_ID " \
--location "global"
gcloud kms keys create "my-cmek-key" \
--project " KMS_PROJECT_ID " \
--location "global" \
--keyring "secret-manager-cmek" \
--purpose "encryption"
Grant the service identity for Secret Manager access to encrypt and
decrypt using the CMEK key. This command grants the Cloud KMS Encrypter
/ Decrypter role ( roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter ) on the
my-cmek-key Cloud KMS key to the service identity.
gcloud
To use Secret Manager on the command line, first
Install or upgrade to version 378.0.0 or higher of the Google Cloud CLI .
On Compute Engine or GKE, you must

Create a secret with automatic replication. The resource name of the CMEK key is
stored as metadata on the secret.
gcloud
To use Secret Manager on the command line, first
Install or upgrade to version 378.0.0 or higher of the Google Cloud CLI .

--replication-policy "automatic" \
--kms-key-name "projects/ KMS_PROJECT_ID /locations/global/keyRings/secret-manager-cmek/cryptoKeys/my-cmek-key" \
--project " SM_PROJECT_ID "
API
These examples use curl to demonstrate using the API. You can generate access tokens with gcloud auth print-access-token .
On Compute Engine or GKE, you must
authenticate with the cloud-platform scope .
Set the value of replication.automatic.customerManagedEncryption.kmsKeyName
to the resource name for the CMEK key.
curl "https://secretmanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ ${ SM_PROJECT_ID } /secrets?secretId= SECRET_ID " \
--request "POST" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN " \

}
}
}
EOF
Now, each time a secret version is created in that secret, the secret version's
payload is automatically encrypted using the key before being written to
persistent storage, as long as the service identity has access to the CMEK key.
If the service identity loses access or if the key becomes unavailable, an
attempt to create a new secret version or access an existing one returns an
error.
Add a new secret version. Notice that you don't specify the Cloud KMS
key's resource name; it is read from the secret's metadata.

The secret version is created, even if the caller doesn't have direct access to
use the CMEK key. The service identity for Secret Manager, rather than
the caller, is responsible for encrypting and decrypting secrets when reading or
writing them.
Similarly, you don't need direct access to the CMEK key in order to access the
secret. The service identity accesses the key and encrypts or decrypts the secret
on your behalf.

Warning: Updating the CMEK configuration only applies to new secret versions.
Existing secret versions are not re-encrypted. Existing secret versions can't be
accessed if the CMEK key that encrypted it is unavailable. If a key is
destroyed, the secret data is unrecoverable. Note: Secret Manager does not currently support modifying other
properties of the replication policy other than the CMEK configuration.
CMEK with user managed replication
This section covers secrets that are configured with a user managed replication
policy. With a user managed replication policy, you control the Google Cloud location
where the secret is stored. Secrets are always accessible from every Google Cloud location.
Secrets with a user managed replication policy must use Cloud KMS keys
that map exactly to the locations in which the secret versions are stored. The
examples in this guide store a secret in two separate locations: us-east1, us-
central1. Requests to access the secret are routed to one of these locations.
In each of the two regions, create a key ring and a Cloud KMS key with
the purpose of encryption, or use an existing key. This example creates a new
key ring called "secret-manager-cmek" , then creates a key called
"my-cmek-key" in each region.

Add a Cloud EKM key to a CMEK policy
This section covers adding a Cloud EKM key to a CMEK policy. These
steps enable a Cloud EKM key to be used to encrypt or decrypt secrets.
Since Cloud EKM does not currently support the global multi-region,
Cloud EKM keys can only be used with secrets configured for user
managed replication.
Create a symmetric key in the us-central1 Cloud KMS region (or any
region except for global ). This example creates a new key ring called
secret-manager-cmek-ekm , then creates a new key called my-ekm-key on the key
ring.

Install or upgrade to version 378.0.0 or higher of the Google Cloud CLI .
On Compute Engine or GKE, you must
authenticate with the cloud-platform scope .
Create a new key ring:
gcloud kms keyrings create "secret-manager-cmek-ekm" \
--project " KMS_PROJECT_ID " \
--location "us-central1"
Create a key in that key ring:
gcloud kms keys create "my-ekm-key" \
--keyring "secret-manager-cmek-ekm" \
--location "us-central1" \
--purpose "encryption" \
--protection-level "external" \
--skip-initial-version-creation \
--default-algorithm "external-symmetric-encryption"
Next, create a new version of my-ekm-key using the external URI of the key.
For more information on external URIs for Cloud EKM keys, see Create
an external key .

Grant the service identity for Secret Manager access to encrypt and
decrypt using the external key. This command grants the Cloud KMS
Encrypter / Decrypter role ( roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter ) on
my-ekm-key to the service identity.

Now, each time a secret version is created in my-ekm-secret , the secret version's
payload is automatically encrypted using the Cloud EKM key before being written to
persistent storage, as long as the service identity has access to the key.
If the service identity loses access or if the key becomes unavailable, an
attempt to create a new secret version or access an existing one returns an
error.
Add a new secret version. Notice that the key's resource name is read from the
secret's metadata.

The secret version is created, even if the caller doesn't have direct access to
use the key. The service identity for Secret Manager, rather than the
caller, is responsible for encrypting and decrypting secrets when reading or
writing them.
Access the secret version you just created. This is where the service identity
accesses the key and encrypts or decrypts the secret on your behalf.

API
These examples use curl to demonstrate using the API. You can generate access tokens with gcloud auth print-access-token .
On Compute Engine or GKE, you must
authenticate with the cloud-platform scope .
curl "https://secretmanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ ${ SM_PROJECT_ID } /secrets/ SECRET_ID ?updateMask=replication" \
--request "PATCH" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN " \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data-binary @- <<EOF
{
"replication" : {
"automatic" : {}
}
}
EOF
Warning: Removing CMEK configuration only applies to new secret versions.
Existing secret versions are not affected. Existing secret versions can't be
accessed if the CMEK key that encrypted it is unavailable. If a key is
destroyed, the secret data is unrecoverable.
