Analyze secrets with Cloud Asset Inventory
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to use Cloud Asset Inventory to monitor your secrets, export data for analysis, and
run powerful queries to get the insights that you require.
Overview
Cloud Asset Inventory analyzes your Google Cloud environment and records any changes to your cloud resources,
such as virtual machines, databases, storage buckets, and in this context, your Secret Manager
secrets. The integration between Secret Manager and Cloud Asset Inventory helps you do the following:
Run queries : Search for specific secrets or identify patterns across your secrets.
Set up alerts : Configure Cloud Asset Inventory to send notifications to Pub/Sub when
specific events occur, such as when secrets are created, modified, or deleted.
Export data : Export your secret inventory to BigQuery for in-depth analysis
and reporting.
Manage and analyze your secrets : See all your secrets in one place (across projects
and your entire organization) and identify secrets that might be misconfigured or violate your
organization's security policies. For example, you can find secrets that are not rotated regularly
or lack proper access controls.
This is an advanced task for Secret Manager users. Before reading this page, we recommend
that you read the following:
Secret Manager overview
to understand the key concepts and features of Secret Manager
Cloud Asset Inventory overview to understand
Cloud Asset Inventory and to see its comprehensive asset management features
Querying Secret Manager
To analyze your secrets with SQL-like queries, we recommend that you
export your secret and secret
versions to BigQuery. Secret Manager isn't integrated with
Asset Search or
Policy Analyzer . These queries use the
Google Cloud CLI and BigQuery to search your assets.
Limitations
Using Cloud Asset Inventory to analyze Secret Manager resources has the following limitation:
Cloud Asset Inventory supports exporting and listing snapshots for only the past five weeks.
Monitor asset changes
Cloud Asset Inventory tracks real-time updates and supports monitoring these changes .
You can configure feeds
to send notifications to a set of configured Pub/Sub topics each time there's a modification
to your resources. Additionally, Cloud Asset Inventory supports
configuring conditions on your feeds ,
so that you can monitor specific changes for certain asset types. To learn how to trigger workflows on asset
changes, see the Pub/Sub documentation .
Export assets to BigQuery
Exporting your secrets and secret versions to BigQuery lets you run SQL-like queries over
large amounts of data and produce meaningful insights about your assets. Before you export your assets,
ensure that your dataset and service accounts are configured correctly .
To export your assets, run the following command:
gcloud
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
CONTENT_TYPE : the asset content type ( RESOURCE ).
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project containing the secrets to be analyzed.
SNAPSHOT_TIME : the time
at which to snapshot resources. This may be between the current time and 5 weeks in the past.
BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that the BigQuery table is in.
DATASET_ID : the ID of the BigQuery dataset.
TABLE_NAME : the table you're exporting your metadata to. If it doesn't exist, it's created.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud asset export \
--content-type = CONTENT_TYPE \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--snapshot-time = SNAPSHOT_TIME \
--bigquery-table = projects/ BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID /tables/ TABLE_NAME \
--output-bigquery-force
Windows (PowerShell)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud asset export `
--content-type = CONTENT_TYPE `
--project = PROJECT_ID `
--snapshot-time = SNAPSHOT_TIME `
--bigquery-table = projects/ BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID /tables/ TABLE_NAME `
--output-bigquery-force
Windows (cmd.exe)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud asset export ^
--content-type = CONTENT_TYPE ^
--project = PROJECT_ID ^
--snapshot-time = SNAPSHOT_TIME ^
--bigquery-table = projects/ BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID /tables/ TABLE_NAME ^
--output-bigquery-force
Note: Cloud Asset Inventory doesn't support appending data to an existing table. Data
must be sent to a new table, or overwrite an existing table.
For more information, see Exporting to BigQuery .
