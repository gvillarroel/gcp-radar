JSON Web Token
(JWT) .
AuthReflection
Holder for reflection information generated from google/api/auth.proto
AuthRequirement
User-defined authentication requirements, including support for
JSON Web Token
(JWT) .
Authentication
Authentication defines the authentication configuration for API methods
provided by an API service.
Example:
name: calendar.googleapis.com
authentication:
providers:
- id: google_calendar_auth
jwks_uri: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
issuer: https://securetoken.google.com
rules:
- selector: "*"
requirements:
provider_id: google_calendar_auth
- selector: google.calendar.Delegate
oauth:
canonical_scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.read
AuthenticationRule
Authentication rules for the service.
By default, if a method has any authentication requirements, every request
must include a valid credential matching one of the requirements.
It's an error to include more than one kind of credential in a single
request.
If a method doesn't have any auth requirements, request credentials will be
ignored.

Billing
Billing related configuration of the service.
The following example shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
for billing, consumer_destinations is the only supported destination and
the monitored resources need at least one label key
cloud.googleapis.com/location to indicate the location of the billing
usage, using different monitored resources between monitoring and billing is
recommended so they can be evolved independently:
monitored_resources:
- type: library.googleapis.com/billing_branch
labels:
- key: cloud.googleapis.com/location
description: |
Predefined label to support billing location restriction.
- key: city
description: |

Context
Context defines which contexts an API requests.
Example:
context:
rules:
- selector: "*"
requested:
- google.rpc.context.ProjectContext
- google.rpc.context.OriginContext
The above specifies that all methods in the API request
google.rpc.context.ProjectContext and
google.rpc.context.OriginContext .
Available context types are defined in package
google.rpc.context .
This also provides mechanism to allowlist any protobuf message extension that
can be sent in grpc metadata using “x-goog-ext-<extension_id>-bin” and
“x-goog-ext-<extension_id>-jspb” format. For example, list any service
specific protobuf types that can appear in grpc metadata as follows in your
yaml file:
Example:
context:
rules:
- selector: "google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.CreateBook"
allowed_request_extensions:
- google.foo.v1.NewExtension
allowed_response_extensions:
- google.foo.v1.NewExtension
You can also specify extension ID instead of fully qualified extension name
here.

Distribution
Distribution contains summary statistics for a population of values. It
optionally contains a histogram representing the distribution of those values
across a set of buckets.
The summary statistics are the count, mean, sum of the squared deviation from
the mean, the minimum, and the maximum of the set of population of values.
The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values
that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either
explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing
widths.
Although it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include
non-finite values (infinities or NaNs) in the population of values, as this
will render the mean and sum_of_squared_deviation fields meaningless.
Distribution.Types
Container for nested types declared in the Distribution message type.
Distribution.Types.BucketOptions
BucketOptions describes the bucket boundaries used to create a histogram
for the distribution. The buckets can be in a linear sequence, an
exponential sequence, or each bucket can be specified explicitly.
BucketOptions does not include the number of values in each bucket.
A bucket has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the
values that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket must
be strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets for a
distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more
finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N -
1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i > 0) is the
same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span the whole range
of finite values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is -infinity and the
upper bound of the overflow bucket is +infinity. The finite buckets are
so-called because both bounds are finite.
Distribution.Types.BucketOptions.Types
Container for nested types declared in the BucketOptions message type.
Distribution.Types.BucketOptions.Types.Explicit
Specifies a set of buckets with arbitrary widths.
There are size(bounds) + 1 (= N) buckets. Bucket i has the following
boundaries:
Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1): bounds[i]
Lower bound (1 <= i < N); bounds[i - 1]
The bounds field must contain at least one element. If bounds has
only one element, then there are no finite buckets, and that single
element is the common boundary of the overflow and underflow buckets.
Distribution.Types.BucketOptions.Types.Exponential
Specifies an exponential sequence of buckets that have a width that is
proportional to the value of the lower bound. Each bucket represents a
constant relative uncertainty on a specific value in the bucket.
There are num_finite_buckets + 2 (= N) buckets. Bucket i has the
following boundaries:
Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1): scale * (growth_factor ^ i).
Lower bound (1 <= i < N): scale * (growth_factor ^ (i - 1)).
Distribution.Types.BucketOptions.Types.Linear
Specifies a linear sequence of buckets that all have the same width
(except overflow and underflow). Each bucket represents a constant
absolute uncertainty on the specific value in the bucket.
There are num_finite_buckets + 2 (= N) buckets. Bucket i has the
following boundaries:
Upper bound (0 <= i < N-1): offset + (width * i).
Lower bound (1 <= i < N): offset + (width * (i - 1)).
Distribution.Types.Exemplar
Exemplars are example points that may be used to annotate aggregated
distribution values. They are metadata that gives information about a
particular value added to a Distribution bucket, such as a trace ID that
was active when a value was added. They may contain further information,
such as a example values and timestamps, origin, etc.
Distribution.Types.Range
The range of the population values.

Documentation
Documentation provides the information for describing a service.
Example:
<pre><code>documentation:
summary: >
The Google Calendar API gives access
to most calendar features.
pages:
name: Overview
content: &#40;== include google/foo/overview.md ==&#41;
name: Tutorial
content: &#40;== include google/foo/tutorial.md ==&#41;
subpages:
name: Java
content: &#40;== include google/foo/tutorial_java.md ==&#41;
rules:
selector: google.calendar.Calendar.Get
description: >
...
selector: google.calendar.Calendar.Put
description: >
...
</code></pre>
Documentation is provided in markdown syntax. In addition to
standard markdown features, definition lists, tables and fenced
code blocks are supported. Section headers can be provided and are
interpreted relative to the section nesting of the context where
a documentation fragment is embedded.
Documentation from the IDL is merged with documentation defined
via the config at normalization time, where documentation provided
by config rules overrides IDL provided.
A number of constructs specific to the API platform are supported
in documentation text.
In order to reference a proto element, the following
notation can be used:
<pre><code>&#91;fully.qualified.proto.name]&#91;]</code></pre>
To override the display text used for the link, this can be used:
<pre><code>&#91;display text]&#91;fully.qualified.proto.name]</code></pre>
Text can be excluded from doc using the following notation:
<pre><code>&#40;-- internal comment --&#41;</code></pre>
A few directives are available in documentation. Note that
directives must appear on a single line to be properly
identified. The include directive includes a markdown file from
an external source:
<pre><code>&#40;== include path/to/file ==&#41;</code></pre>
The resource_for directive marks a message to be the resource of
a collection in REST view. If it is not specified, tools attempt
to infer the resource from the operations in a collection:
<pre><code>&#40;== resource_for v1.shelves.books ==&#41;</code></pre>
The directive suppress_warning does not directly affect documentation
and is documented together with service config validation.

Endpoint
Endpoint describes a network address of a service that serves a set of
APIs. It is commonly known as a service endpoint. A service may expose
any number of service endpoints, and all service endpoints share the same
service definition, such as quota limits and monitoring metrics.
Example:
type: google.api.Service
name: library-example.googleapis.com
endpoints:
# Declares network address `https://library-example.googleapis.com`
# for service `library-example.googleapis.com`. The `https` scheme
# is implicit for all service endpoints. Other schemes may be
# supported in the future.
- name: library-example.googleapis.com
allow_cors: false
- name: content-staging-library-example.googleapis.com
# Allows HTTP OPTIONS calls to be passed to the API frontend, for it
# to decide whether the subsequent cross-origin request is allowed
# to proceed.

FieldPolicy
Google API Policy Annotation
This message defines a simple API policy annotation that can be used to
annotate API request and response message fields with applicable policies.
One field may have multiple applicable policies that must all be satisfied
before a request can be processed. This policy annotation is used to
generate the overall policy that will be used for automatic runtime
policy enforcement and documentation generation.
GoSettings
Settings for Go client libraries.
Http
Defines the HTTP configuration for an API service. It contains a list of
[HttpRule][google.api.HttpRule], each specifying the mapping of an RPC method
to one or more HTTP REST API methods.
HttpBody
Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
an HTML page.
This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
the request as well as the response.
It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.
Example:
message GetResourceRequest {
// A unique request id.
string request_id = 1;
// The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;
}
service ResourceService {
rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest)
returns (google.api.HttpBody);
rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody)
returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
}
Example with streaming methods:
service CaldavService {
rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
}
Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are
handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.

HttpRule
gRPC Transcoding
gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or
more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service
that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including Google
APIs ,
Cloud Endpoints , gRPC
Gateway ,
and Envoy proxy support this feature
and use it for large scale production services.
HttpRule defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies
how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. HttpRule is
typically specified as an google.api.http annotation on the gRPC method.
Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long
as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
the URL path.
Example:
service Messaging {
rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
option (google.api.http) = {
get: "/v1/{name=messages/*}"
};
}
}
message GetMessageRequest {
string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
}
message Message {
string text = 1; // The resource content.
}
This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:
HTTP: GET /v1/messages/123456
gRPC: GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")
Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
For example:
service Messaging {
rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
option (google.api.http) = {
get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}"
};
}
}
message GetMessageRequest {
message SubMessage {
string subfield = 1;
}
string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
int64 revision = 2; // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.
SubMessage sub = 3; // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.
}
This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:
HTTP: GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo
gRPC: GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub:
SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))
Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
as ...?param=A&param=B . In the case of a message type, each field of the
message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C .
For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the body field
specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
message resource collection:
service Messaging {
rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
option (google.api.http) = {
patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
body: "message"
};
}
}
message UpdateMessageRequest {
string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
Message message = 2; // mapped to the body
}
The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
protos JSON encoding:
HTTP: PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }
gRPC: UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })
The special name * can be used in the body mapping to define that
every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
request body. This enables the following alternative definition of
the update method:
service Messaging {
rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
option (google.api.http) = {
patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
body: "*"
};
}
}
message Message {
string message_id = 1;
string text = 2;
}
The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
HTTP: PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }
gRPC: UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")
Note that when using * in the body mapping, it is not possible to
have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
defining REST APIs. The common usage of * is in custom methods
which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
the additional_bindings option. Example:
service Messaging {
rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
option (google.api.http) = {
get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
additional_bindings {
get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
}
};
}
}
message GetMessageRequest {
string message_id = 1;
string user_id = 2;
}
This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:
HTTP: GET /v1/messages/123456
gRPC: GetMessage(message_id: "123456")
HTTP: GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456
gRPC: GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id: "123456")
Rules for HTTP mapping
Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
message) are classified into three categories:
Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
Fields referred by the [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body]. They
are passed via the HTTP
request body.
All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
name.
If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is "*", there is no URL
query parameter, all fields
are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is omitted, there is no HTTP
request body, all
fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.
Path template syntax
Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
Segment = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
Verb = ":" LITERAL ;
The syntax * matches a single URL path segment. The syntax ** matches
zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
except the Verb .
The syntax Variable matches part of the URL path as specified by its
template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. {var}
is equivalent to {var=*} .
The syntax LITERAL matches literal text in the URL path. If the LITERAL
contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
before the matching.
If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as "{var}" or
"{var=*}" , when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
side, all characters except [-_.~0-9a-zA-Z] are percent-encoded. The
server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
Discovery
Document as
{var} .
If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as "{var=foo/*}"
or "{var=**}" , when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
client side, all characters except [-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z] are percent-encoded.
The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
unchanged. Such variables show up in the
Discovery
Document as
{+var} .
Using gRPC API Service Configuration
gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
service config is simply the YAML representation of the google.api.Service
proto message.
As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
HttpRule that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
configuration in the proto.
The following example selects a gRPC method and applies an HttpRule to it:
http:
rules:
- selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
Special notes
When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
proto to JSON conversion must follow the proto3
specification .
While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
RFC 6570 Section 3.2.2 Simple String
Expansion, the multi segment variable does not follow RFC 6570 Section
3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
does not expand special characters like ? and # , which would lead
to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
for multi segment variables.
The path variables must not refer to any repeated or mapped field,
because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.
The path variables must not capture the leading "/" character. The reason
is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
no client library can support such complicated mapping.
If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map
the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC
Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.

identifies the actual resource and its attributes according to the schema.
For example, a particular Compute Engine VM instance could be represented by
the following object, because the
[MonitoredResourceDescriptor][google.api.MonitoredResourceDescriptor] for
"gce_instance" has labels
"project_id" , "instance_id" and "zone" :
{ "type": "gce_instance",
"labels": { "project_id": "my-project",
"instance_id": "12345678901234",
"zone": "us-central1-a" }}
MonitoredResourceDescriptor
An object that describes the schema of a
[MonitoredResource][google.api.MonitoredResource] object using a type name
and a set of labels. For example, the monitored resource descriptor for
Google Compute Engine VM instances has a type of
"gce_instance" and specifies the use of the labels "instance_id" and
"zone" to identify particular VM instances.
Different APIs can support different monitored resource types. APIs generally
provide a list method that returns the monitored resource descriptors used
by the API.
MonitoredResourceMetadata
Auxiliary metadata for a [MonitoredResource][google.api.MonitoredResource]
object. [MonitoredResource][google.api.MonitoredResource] objects contain the
minimum set of information to uniquely identify a monitored resource
instance. There is some other useful auxiliary metadata. Monitoring and
Logging use an ingestion pipeline to extract metadata for cloud resources of
all types, and store the metadata in this message.
MonitoredResourceReflection
Holder for reflection information generated from google/api/monitored_resource.proto
Monitoring
Monitoring configuration of the service.
The example below shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
for monitoring. In the example, a monitored resource and two metrics are
defined. The library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count metric is sent
to both producer and consumer projects, whereas the
library.googleapis.com/book/num_overdue metric is only sent to the
consumer project.
monitored_resources:
- type: library.googleapis.com/Branch
display_name: "Library Branch"
description: "A branch of a library."
launch_stage: GA
labels:
- key: resource_container
description: "The Cloud container (ie. project id) for the Branch."
- key: location
description: "The location of the library branch."
- key: branch_id
description: "The id of the branch."
metrics:
- name: library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
display_name: "Books Returned"
description: "The count of books that have been returned."
launch_stage: GA
metric_kind: DELTA
value_type: INT64
unit: "1"
labels:
- key: customer_id
description: "The id of the customer."
- name: library.googleapis.com/book/num_overdue
display_name: "Books Overdue"
description: "The current number of overdue books."
launch_stage: GA
metric_kind: GAUGE
value_type: INT64
unit: "1"
labels:
- key: customer_id
description: "The id of the customer."

- library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
- library.googleapis.com/book/num_overdue
Monitoring.Types
Container for nested types declared in the Monitoring message type.
Monitoring.Types.MonitoringDestination
Configuration of a specific monitoring destination (the producer project
or the consumer project).
MonitoringReflection
Holder for reflection information generated from google/api/monitoring.proto
NodeSettings
Settings for Node client libraries.
OAuthRequirements
OAuth scopes are a way to define data and permissions on data. For example,
there are scopes defined for "Read-only access to Google Calendar" and
"Access to Cloud Platform". Users can consent to a scope for an application,
giving it permission to access that data on their behalf.
OAuth scope specifications should be fairly coarse grained; a user will need
to see and understand the text description of what your scope means.
In most cases: use one or at most two OAuth scopes for an entire family of
products. If your product has multiple APIs, you should probably be sharing
the OAuth scope across all of those APIs.
When you need finer grained OAuth consent screens: talk with your product
management about how developers will use them in practice.
Please note that even though each of the canonical scopes is enough for a
request to be accepted and passed to the backend, a request can still fail
due to the backend requiring additional scopes or permissions.

ProjectProperties
A descriptor for defining project properties for a service. One service may
have many consumer projects, and the service may want to behave differently
depending on some properties on the project. For example, a project may be
associated with a school, or a business, or a government agency, a business
type property on the project may affect how a service responds to the client.
This descriptor defines which properties are allowed to be set on a project.
Example:
project_properties:
properties:
name: NO_WATERMARK
type: BOOL
description: Allows usage of the API without watermarks.
name: EXTENDED_TILE_CACHE_PERIOD
type: INT64
Property
Defines project properties.
API services can define properties that can be assigned to consumer projects
so that backends can perform response customization without having to make
additional calls or maintain additional storage. For example, Maps API
defines properties that controls map tile cache period, or whether to embed a
watermark in a result.
These values can be set via API producer console. Only API providers can
define and set these properties.
Property.Types
Container for nested types declared in the Property message type.
Publishing
This message configures the settings for publishing Google Cloud Client
libraries
generated from the service config.
PythonSettings
Settings for Python client libraries.
PythonSettings.Types
Container for nested types declared in the PythonSettings message type.
PythonSettings.Types.ExperimentalFeatures
Experimental features to be included during client library generation.
These fields will be deprecated once the feature graduates and is enabled
by default.
Quota
Quota configuration helps to achieve fairness and budgeting in service
usage.
The metric based quota configuration works this way:
The service configuration defines a set of metrics.
For API calls, the quota.metric_rules maps methods to metrics with
corresponding costs.
The quota.limits defines limits on the metrics, which will be used for
quota checks at runtime.
An example quota configuration in yaml format:
quota:
limits:
- name: apiWriteQpsPerProject
metric: library.googleapis.com/write_calls
unit: "1/min/{project}" # rate limit for consumer projects
values:
STANDARD: 10000
(The metric rules bind all methods to the read_calls metric,
except for the UpdateBook and DeleteBook methods. These two methods
are mapped to the write_calls metric, with the UpdateBook method
consuming at twice rate as the DeleteBook method.)
metric_rules:
- selector: "*"
metric_costs:
library.googleapis.com/read_calls: 1
- selector: google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.UpdateBook
metric_costs:
library.googleapis.com/write_calls: 2
- selector: google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.DeleteBook
metric_costs:
library.googleapis.com/write_calls: 1
Corresponding Metric definition:
metrics:
- name: library.googleapis.com/read_calls
display_name: Read requests
metric_kind: DELTA
value_type: INT64
- name: library.googleapis.com/write_calls
display_name: Write requests
metric_kind: DELTA
value_type: INT64
QuotaLimit
QuotaLimit defines a specific limit that applies over a specified duration
for a limit type. There can be at most one limit for a duration and limit
type combination defined within a QuotaGroup .
QuotaReflection
Holder for reflection information generated from google/api/quota.proto
ResourceDescriptor
A simple descriptor of a resource type.
ResourceDescriptor annotates a resource message (either by means of a
protobuf annotation or use in the service config), and associates the
resource's schema, the resource type, and the pattern of the resource name.
Example:
message Topic {
// Indicates this message defines a resource schema.
// Declares the resource type in the format of {service}/{kind}.
// For Kubernetes resources, the format is {api group}/{kind}.
option (google.api.resource) = {
type: "pubsub.googleapis.com/Topic"
pattern: "projects/{project}/topics/{topic}"
};
}
The ResourceDescriptor Yaml config will look like:
resources:
- type: "pubsub.googleapis.com/Topic"
pattern: "projects/{project}/topics/{topic}"
Sometimes, resources have multiple patterns, typically because they can
live under multiple parents.
Example:
message LogEntry {
option (google.api.resource) = {
type: "logging.googleapis.com/LogEntry"
pattern: "projects/{project}/logs/{log}"
pattern: "folders/{folder}/logs/{log}"
pattern: "organizations/{organization}/logs/{log}"
pattern: "billingAccounts/{billing_account}/logs/{log}"
};
}
The ResourceDescriptor Yaml config will look like:
resources:
- type: 'logging.googleapis.com/LogEntry'
pattern: "projects/{project}/logs/{log}"
pattern: "folders/{folder}/logs/{log}"
pattern: "organizations/{organization}/logs/{log}"
pattern: "billingAccounts/{billing_account}/logs/{log}"
ResourceDescriptor.Types
Container for nested types declared in the ResourceDescriptor message type.
ResourceExtensions

an API resource.
ResourceReflection

RoutingExtensions
Holder for extension identifiers generated from the top level of google/api/routing.proto
RoutingParameter
A projection from an input message to the GRPC or REST header.
RoutingReflection
Holder for reflection information generated from google/api/routing.proto
RoutingRule
Specifies the routing information that should be sent along with the request
in the form of routing header.
NOTE: All service configuration rules follow the "last one wins" order.
The examples below will apply to an RPC which has the following request type:
Message Definition:
message Request {
// The name of the Table
// Values can be of the following formats:
// - `projects/<project>/tables/<table>`
// - `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/tables/<table>`
// - `region/<region>/zones/<zone>/tables/<table>`
string table_name = 1;
// This value specifies routing for replication.
// It can be in the following formats:
// - `profiles/<profile_id>`
// - a legacy `profile_id` that can be any string
string app_profile_id = 2;
}
Example message:
{
table_name: projects/proj_foo/instances/instance_bar/table/table_baz,
app_profile_id: profiles/prof_qux
}
The routing header consists of one or multiple key-value pairs. Every key
and value must be percent-encoded, and joined together in the format of
key1=value1&key2=value2 .
The examples below skip the percent-encoding for readability.
Example 1
Extracting a field from the request to put into the routing header
unchanged, with the key equal to the field name.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// Take the `app_profile_id`.
routing_parameters {
field: "app_profile_id"
}
};
result:
x-goog-request-params: app_profile_id=profiles/prof_qux
Example 2
Extracting a field from the request to put into the routing header
unchanged, with the key different from the field name.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// Take the `app_profile_id`, but name it `routing_id` in the header.
routing_parameters {
field: "app_profile_id"
path_template: "{routing_id=**}"
}
};
result:
x-goog-request-params: routing_id=profiles/prof_qux
Example 3
Extracting a field from the request to put into the routing
header, while matching a path template syntax on the field's value.
NB: it is more useful to send nothing than to send garbage for the purpose
of dynamic routing, since garbage pollutes cache. Thus the matching.
Sub-example 3a
The field matches the template.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// Take the `table_name`, if it's well-formed (with project-based
// syntax).
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{table_name=projects/*/instances/*/**}"
}
};
result:
x-goog-request-params:
table_name=projects/proj_foo/instances/instance_bar/table/table_baz
Sub-example 3b
The field does not match the template.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// Take the `table_name`, if it's well-formed (with region-based
// syntax).
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{table_name=regions/*/zones/*/**}"
}
};
result:
<no routing header will be sent>
Sub-example 3c
Multiple alternative conflictingly named path templates are
specified. The one that matches is used to construct the header.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// Take the `table_name`, if it's well-formed, whether
// using the region- or projects-based syntax.
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{table_name=regions/*/zones/*/**}"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{table_name=projects/*/instances/*/**}"
}
};
result:
x-goog-request-params:
table_name=projects/proj_foo/instances/instance_bar/table/table_baz
Example 4
Extracting a single routing header key-value pair by matching a
template syntax on (a part of) a single request field.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// Take just the project id from the `table_name` field.
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{routing_id=projects/*}/**"
}
};
result:
x-goog-request-params: routing_id=projects/proj_foo
Example 5
Extracting a single routing header key-value pair by matching
several conflictingly named path templates on (parts of) a single request
field. The last template to match "wins" the conflict.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// If the `table_name` does not have instances information,
// take just the project id for routing.
// Otherwise take project + instance.
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{routing_id=projects/*}/**"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{routing_id=projects/*/instances/*}/**"
}
};
result:
x-goog-request-params:
routing_id=projects/proj_foo/instances/instance_bar
Example 6
Extracting multiple routing header key-value pairs by matching
several non-conflicting path templates on (parts of) a single request field.
Sub-example 6a
Make the templates strict, so that if the table_name does not
have an instance information, nothing is sent.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// The routing code needs two keys instead of one composite
// but works only for the tables with the "project-instance" name
// syntax.
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{project_id=projects/*}/instances/*/**"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "projects/*/{instance_id=instances/*}/**"
}
};
result:
x-goog-request-params:
project_id=projects/proj_foo&instance_id=instances/instance_bar
Sub-example 6b
Make the templates loose, so that if the table_name does not
have an instance information, just the project id part is sent.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// The routing code wants two keys instead of one composite
// but will work with just the `project_id` for tables without
// an instance in the `table_name`.
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{project_id=projects/*}/**"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "projects/*/{instance_id=instances/*}/**"
}
};
result (is the same as 6a for our example message because it has the instance
information):
x-goog-request-params:
project_id=projects/proj_foo&instance_id=instances/instance_bar
Example 7
Extracting multiple routing header key-value pairs by matching
several path templates on multiple request fields.
NB: note that here there is no way to specify sending nothing if one of the
fields does not match its template. E.g. if the table_name is in the wrong
format, the project_id will not be sent, but the routing_id will be.
The backend routing code has to be aware of that and be prepared to not
receive a full complement of keys if it expects multiple.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// The routing needs both `project_id` and `routing_id`
// (from the `app_profile_id` field) for routing.
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{project_id=projects/*}/**"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "app_profile_id"
path_template: "{routing_id=**}"
}
};
result:
x-goog-request-params:
project_id=projects/proj_foo&routing_id=profiles/prof_qux
Example 8
Extracting a single routing header key-value pair by matching
several conflictingly named path templates on several request fields. The
last template to match "wins" the conflict.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// The `routing_id` can be a project id or a region id depending on
// the table name format, but only if the `app_profile_id` is not set.
// If `app_profile_id` is set it should be used instead.
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{routing_id=projects/*}/**"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{routing_id=regions/*}/**"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "app_profile_id"
path_template: "{routing_id=**}"
}
};
result:
x-goog-request-params: routing_id=profiles/prof_qux
Example 9
Bringing it all together.
annotation:
option (google.api.routing) = {
// For routing both `table_location` and a `routing_id` are needed.
//
// table_location can be either an instance id or a region+zone id.
//
// For `routing_id`, take the value of `app_profile_id`
// - If it's in the format `profiles/<profile_id>`, send
// just the `<profile_id>` part.
// - If it's any other literal, send it as is.
// If the `app_profile_id` is empty, and the `table_name` starts with
// the project_id, send that instead.
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "projects/*/{table_location=instances/*}/tables/*"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{table_location=regions/*/zones/*}/tables/*"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "table_name"
path_template: "{routing_id=projects/*}/**"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "app_profile_id"
path_template: "{routing_id=**}"
}
routing_parameters {
field: "app_profile_id"
path_template: "profiles/{routing_id=*}"
}
};
result:

SelectiveGapicGeneration
This message is used to configure the generation of a subset of the RPCs in
a service for client libraries.
Service
Service is the root object of Google API service configuration (service
config). It describes the basic information about a logical service,
such as the service name and the user-facing title, and delegates other
aspects to sub-sections. Each sub-section is either a proto message or a
repeated proto message that configures a specific aspect, such as auth.
For more information, see each proto message definition.
Example:
type: google.api.Service
name: calendar.googleapis.com
title: Google Calendar API
apis:
- name: google.calendar.v3.Calendar
visibility:
rules:
- selector: "google.calendar.v3.*"
restriction: PREVIEW

ServiceReflection
Holder for reflection information generated from google/api/service.proto
SourceInfo
Source information used to create a Service Config
SourceInfoReflection
Holder for reflection information generated from google/api/source_info.proto
SystemParameter
Define a parameter's name and location. The parameter may be passed as either
an HTTP header or a URL query parameter, and if both are passed the behavior
is implementation-dependent.
SystemParameterReflection
Holder for reflection information generated from google/api/system_parameter.proto
SystemParameterRule
Define a system parameter rule mapping system parameter definitions to
methods.
SystemParameters
System parameter configuration
A system parameter is a special kind of parameter defined by the API
system, not by an individual API. It is typically mapped to an HTTP header
and/or a URL query parameter. This configuration specifies which methods
change the names of the system parameters.
TypeReference
A reference to a message type, for use in [FieldInfo][google.api.FieldInfo].
Usage
Configuration controlling usage of a service.
UsageReflection
Holder for reflection information generated from google/api/usage.proto
UsageRule
Usage configuration rules for the service.
NOTE: Under development.
Use this rule to configure unregistered calls for the service. Unregistered
calls are calls that do not contain consumer project identity.
(Example: calls that do not contain an API key).
By default, API methods do not allow unregistered calls, and each method call
must be identified by a consumer project identity. Use this rule to
allow/disallow unregistered calls.
Example of an API that wants to allow unregistered calls for entire service.
usage:
rules:
- selector: "*"
allow_unregistered_calls: true
Example of a method that wants to allow unregistered calls.
usage:
rules:
- selector: "google.example.library.v1.LibraryService.CreateBook"
allow_unregistered_calls: true
Visibility
Visibility restricts service consumer's access to service elements,
such as whether an application can call a visibility-restricted method.
The restriction is expressed by applying visibility labels on service
elements. The visibility labels are elsewhere linked to service consumers.
A service can define multiple visibility labels, but a service consumer
should be granted at most one visibility label. Multiple visibility
labels for a single service consumer are not supported.
If an element and all its parents have no visibility label, its visibility
is unconditionally granted.
Example:
visibility:
rules:
- selector: google.calendar.Calendar.EnhancedSearch
restriction: PREVIEW
- selector: google.calendar.Calendar.Delegate
restriction: INTERNAL
Here, all methods are publicly visible except for the restricted methods
EnhancedSearch and Delegate.
VisibilityExtensions

VisibilityRule
A visibility rule provides visibility configuration for an individual API
element.
Enums
BackendRule.AuthenticationOneofCase
Enum of possible cases for the "authentication" oneof.
BackendRule.Types.PathTranslation
Path Translation specifies how to combine the backend address with the
request path in order to produce the appropriate forwarding URL for the
request.
Path Translation is applicable only to HTTP-based backends. Backends which
do not accept requests over HTTP/HTTPS should leave path_translation
unspecified.
ChangeType
Classifies set of possible modifications to an object in the service
configuration.
ClientLibraryDestination
To where should client libraries be published?
ClientLibraryOrganization
The organization for which the client libraries are being published.
Affects the url where generated docs are published, etc.
Distribution.Types.BucketOptions.OptionsOneofCase
Enum of possible cases for the "options" oneof.
ErrorReason
Defines the supported values for google.rpc.ErrorInfo.reason for the
googleapis.com error domain. This error domain is reserved for Service
Infrastructure .
For each error info of this domain, the metadata key "service" refers to the
logical identifier of an API service, such as "pubsub.googleapis.com". The
"consumer" refers to the entity that consumes an API Service. It typically is
a Google project that owns the client application or the server resource,
such as "projects/123". Other metadata keys are specific to each error
reason. For more information, see the definition of the specific error
reason.
FieldBehavior
An indicator of the behavior of a given field (for example, that a field
is required in requests, or given as output but ignored as input).
This does not change the behavior in protocol buffers itself; it only
denotes the behavior and may affect how API tooling handles the field.
Note: This enum may receive new values in the future.
FieldInfo.Types.Format
The standard format of a field value. The supported formats are all backed
by either an RFC defined by the IETF or a Google-defined AIP.
HttpRule.PatternOneofCase
Enum of possible cases for the "pattern" oneof.
JwtLocation.InOneofCase
Enum of possible cases for the "in" oneof.
