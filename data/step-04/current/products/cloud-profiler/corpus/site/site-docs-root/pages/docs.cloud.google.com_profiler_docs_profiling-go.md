Profiling Go applications
This page describes how to modify your Go application to capture
profiling data and have that data sent to your Google Cloud
project. For general information about profiling, see
Profiling concepts .
Note: If you plan to profile applications that are running outside of
Google Cloud, then you need to perform some configuration steps that
aren't discussed in this document. For example, you must configure the
credentials for the profiling agent and you must link the agent to your
project. For information about these steps, see
Profiling applications running outside Google Cloud .
Profile types for Go:
CPU time
Heap
Allocated heap
Contention (Go mutex)
Threads (Go goroutine)
Supported Go language versions:
All officially maintained Go releases, unless otherwise noted.
For more information, see
Go language release policy .
Supported profiling agent versions:
The most recent release of the agent is supported. In general, releases older
than one year aren't supported. We recommend that you use the most
recently released version of the agent.
Supported operating systems:
Linux. Profiling Go applications is supported for Linux kernels
whose standard C library is implemented with glibc or with musl . For
configuration information specific to Linux Alpine kernels, see
Running on Linux Alpine .
Supported environments:
Compute Engine
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
App Engine flexible environment
App Engine standard environment (requires Go 1.11 or higher)
Outside of Google Cloud (For information on the additional
configuration requirements, see
Profiling applications running outside of Google Cloud .)
Enabling the Profiler API
Before you use the profiling agent, ensure that the underlying
Profiler API is enabled. You can check the status of the API and enable
it if necessary by using either the Google Cloud CLI or
the Google Cloud console:
gcloud CLI
If you have not already installed the Google Cloud CLI on your
workstation, see the Google Cloud CLI documentation .
Run the following command:
gcloud services enable cloudprofiler.googleapis.com
For more information, see
gcloud services .
Google Cloud console
Enable the Cloud Profiler API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
If API enabled is displayed, then the API is already enabled. If not, click the Enable button.
Grant IAM role to service account
If you are deploying your application on Google Cloud resources and if you
are using the default service account and haven't modified the role grants
to that service account, then you can skip this section.
If you do any of the following, then you need to grant the service account
the IAM role of
Cloud Profiler Agent ( roles/cloudprofiler.agent ) :
You are using the default service account but modified its role grants.
You are using a user-created service account.
You are using workload identity ,
grant the Cloud Profiler Agent role to the Kubernetes service account.
You can grant an IAM role to a service account by using the
Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI. For example, you could use the
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding
command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding GCP_PROJECT_ID \
--member serviceAccount: MY_SVC_ACCT_ID @ GCP_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role roles/cloudprofiler.agent
Before you use the previous command, replace the following:
GCP_PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
MY_SVC_ACCT_ID : The name of your service account.
For detailed information, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organization .
Note: If the service account used by the profiling agent doesn't have the
IAM role of Cloud Profiler Agent, then your
Google Cloud project won't have any profile data.
Using Cloud Profiler
In all of the supported environments, you use the Profiler by
importing the package in your application and then initializing the
Profiler as early as possible in your application.
You can enable Mutex-contention profiling (“Contention” in the
interface) by setting the MutexProfiling configuration option to true .
For more information on the Profiler API, including all the
configuration options, see the
public API docs .
Compute Engine
For Compute Engine, in profiler.Config set Service with a
name for the service being profiled and optionally set ServiceVersion with
the service version:
// snippets is an example of starting cloud.google.com/go/profiler.
package main
import (
"cloud.google.com/go/profiler"
)
func main () {
cfg := profiler . Config {
Service : "myservice" ,
ServiceVersion : "1.0.0" ,
// ProjectID must be set if not running on GCP.
// ProjectID: "my-project",
// For OpenCensus users:
// To see Profiler agent spans in APM backend,
// set EnableOCTelemetry to true
// EnableOCTelemetry: true,
}
// Profiler initialization, best done as early as possible.
if err := profiler . Start ( cfg ); err != nil {
// TODO: Handle error.
}
}
If you have dependencies in your source code that are fetched manually,
then you might need to add the following to your
build script or Dockerfile:
go get cloud.google.com/go/profiler
GKE
For GKE, in profiler.Config set Service with a
name for the service being profiled and optionally set ServiceVersion with
the service version:
// snippets is an example of starting cloud.google.com/go/profiler.
package main
import (
"cloud.google.com/go/profiler"
)
func main () {
cfg := profiler . Config {
Service : "myservice" ,
ServiceVersion : "1.0.0" ,
// ProjectID must be set if not running on GCP.
// ProjectID: "my-project",
// For OpenCensus users:
// To see Profiler agent spans in APM backend,
// set EnableOCTelemetry to true
// EnableOCTelemetry: true,
}
// Profiler initialization, best done as early as possible.
if err := profiler . Start ( cfg ); err != nil {
// TODO: Handle error.
}
}
If you have dependencies in your source code that are fetched manually,
then you might need to add the following to your
build script or Dockerfile:
go get cloud.google.com/go/profiler
App Engine
For the App Engine flexible environment and the App Engine
standard environment, the code additions are nearly
identical to those for Compute Engine and GKE.
There is one exception. In both App Engine environments, the
Service and ServiceVersion
parameters are derived from the environment, so you don't have to
specify them.
// appengine is an example of starting cloud.google.com/go/profiler on
// App Engine.
package main
import (
"cloud.google.com/go/profiler"
)
func main () {
// Profiler initialization, best done as early as possible.
if err := profiler . Start ( profiler . Config {
// Service and ServiceVersion can be automatically inferred when running
// on App Engine.
// ProjectID must be set if not running on GCP.
// ProjectID: "my-project",
}); err != nil {
// TODO: Handle error.
}
}
When you run the application locally, set the ProjectID (the ID of your
Google Cloud project) and Service parameters in profiler.Config ,
since they cannot be derived from a local environment. You don't need to set
ServiceVersion .
If you are using App Engine standard environment, see
Migrating your app to Go 1.11 for detailed information on
changes you might need to make to your application. Also, you must use
Google Cloud CLI version 226.0.0 or later. To update the Google Cloud CLI, run the
following command:
gcloud components update
To run your application:
Update the dependencies:
go get cloud.google.com/go/profiler
Deploy the application to your App Engine flexible environment or to
your App Engine standard environment:
gcloud app deploy [ DEPLOYMENT ]
where DEPLOYMENT is the path to your configuration file. For example,
DEPLOYMENT might be main/app.yaml .
For App Engine flexible environment deployment details, see
Testing and deploying your application .
For App Engine standard environment deployment details, see
Testing and deploying your application .
Analyzing data
After Profiler has collected data, you can view and analyze
this data using the Profiler interface.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Profiler page:
Go to Profiler
You can also find this page by using the search bar.
Service name and version arguments
When you load the Profiler agent, you specify a service-name argument and an
optional service-version argument to configure it.
Note: In the App Engine flexible environment, you do not have to specify
these arguments; they are derived from the environment.
The service name lets Profiler collect profiling data for all
replicas of that service. The profiler service ensures a
collection rate of one profile per minute, on average, for each service
name across each combination service versions and zones.
For example, if you have a service with two versions running across
replicas in three zones, the profiler will create an average of 6 profiles
per minute for that service.
If you use different service names for your replicas, then your service will
be profiled more often than necessary, with a correspondingly higher overhead.
When selecting a service name:
Choose a name that clearly represents the service in your application
architecture. The choice of service name is less important if you only run
a single service or application. It is more important if your application
runs as a set of micro-services, for example.
Make sure to not use any process-specific values, like a process ID,
in the service-name string.
The service-name string must match this regular expression:
^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9_.]{0,253}[a-z0-9])?$
A good guideline is to use a static string like imageproc-service as the
service name.
The service version is optional. If you specify the service version,
Profiler can aggregate profiling information from multiple
instances and display it correctly. It can be used to mark different versions
of your services as they get deployed. The Profiler UI lets you
filter the data by service version; this way, you can compare the performance
of older and newer versions of the code.
The value of the service-version argument is a free-form string, but values
for this argument typically look like version numbers, for example,
1.0.0 or 2.1.2 .
Agent logging
The profiling agent can report debug information in its logs. By default,
agent logging is disabled.
To enable agent logging,
set the DebugLogging option to true when starting the agent:
profiler.Start(profiler.Config{..., DebugLogging: true});
Troubleshooting
This section lists issues that are specific to profiling Go applications.
See Troubleshooting
for help with common problems.
Behavior
Cause
Solution
CPU time profiles aren't collected for applications built with
-buildmode=c-archive . Heap, contention, and
thread profiles are collected.
GitHub issue
By default, CPU profiling isn't enabled for Go applications when the
-buildmode flag is c-archive or
c-shared .
Add a call to
signal.Notify(make(
chan os.Signal), syscall.SIGPROF)
before calling profiler.Start .
Response to GitHub issue.
Running with Linux Alpine
The Go profiling agent for Linux Alpine is supported only for
Google Kubernetes Engine configurations.
Authentication error
If you use Docker images that run with
Linux Alpine
(such as golang:alpine or just alpine ),
you might see the following authentication error:
connection error : desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided"
Note that to see the error you must have agent logging enabled.
By default the agent for Go doesn't output any log messages.
The error indicates that the Docker images with Linux Alpine don't have the
root SSL certificates installed by default. Those certificates are necessary for
the profiling agent to communicate with the profiler API. To resolve
this error, add the following apk command to your Dockerfile:
FROM alpine
...
RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates
You then need to rebuild and redeploy your application.
