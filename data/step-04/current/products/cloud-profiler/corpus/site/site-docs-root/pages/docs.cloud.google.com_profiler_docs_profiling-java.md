Profiling Java applications
This page describes how to modify your Java application to capture
profiling data and have that data sent to your Google Cloud
project. For general information about profiling, see
Profiling concepts .
Note: If you plan to profile applications that are running outside of
Google Cloud, then you need to perform some configuration steps that
aren't discussed in this document. For example, you must configure the
credentials for the profiling agent and you must link the agent to your
project. For information about these steps, see
Profiling applications running outside Google Cloud .
Profile types for Java:
CPU time
Heap (requires Java 11 or App Engine standard environment, disabled by default)
Wall time (not available for Java 8 App Engine standard environment)
Supported Java language versions:
HotSpot-based JVMs (including Oracle JDK and some OpenJDK builds) for Java 8, 11 or later.
Supported profiling agent versions:
The most recent release of the agent is supported. In general, releases older
than one year aren't supported. We recommend that you use the most
recently released version of the agent.
Supported operating systems:
Linux. Profiling Java applications is supported for Linux kernels
whose standard C library is implemented with glibc or with musl . For
configuration information specific to Linux Alpine kernels, see
Running on Linux Alpine .
Supported environments:
Compute Engine
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
App Engine flexible environment
App Engine standard environment (requires App Engine SDK version 1.9.64 or later)
Managed Service for Apache Spark (For information, see
Configuring Cloud Profiler for Managed Service for Apache Spark Spark and Hadoop jobs .)
Outside of Google Cloud (For information on the additional
configuration requirements, see
Profiling applications running outside of Google Cloud .)
Enabling the Profiler API
Before you use the profiling agent, ensure that the underlying
Profiler API is enabled. You can check the status of the API and enable
it if necessary by using either the Google Cloud CLI or
the Google Cloud console:
gcloud CLI
If you have not already installed the Google Cloud CLI on your
workstation, see the Google Cloud CLI documentation .
Run the following command:
gcloud services enable cloudprofiler . googleapis . com
For more information, see
gcloud services .
Google Cloud console
Enable the Cloud Profiler API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
If API enabled is displayed, then the API is already enabled. If not, click the Enable button.
Grant IAM role to service account
If you are deploying your application on Google Cloud resources and if you
are using the default service account and haven't modified the role grants
to that service account, then you can skip this section.
If you do any of the following, then you need to grant the service account
the IAM role of
Cloud Profiler Agent ( roles/cloudprofiler.agent ) :
You are using the default service account but modified its role grants.
You are using a user-created service account.
You are using workload identity ,
grant the Cloud Profiler Agent role to the Kubernetes service account.
You can grant an IAM role to a service account by using the
Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI. For example, you could use the
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding
command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding GCP_PROJECT_ID \
--member serviceAccount: MY_SVC_ACCT_ID @ GCP_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role roles/cloudprofiler.agent
Before you use the previous command, replace the following:
GCP_PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
MY_SVC_ACCT_ID : The name of your service account.
For detailed information, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organization .
Note: If the service account used by the profiling agent doesn't have the
IAM role of Cloud Profiler Agent, then your
Google Cloud project won't have any profile data.
Installing the Profiler agent
Compute Engine
Create an installation directory, for example, /opt/cprof , for the
Profiler agent:
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cprof
Download the agent archive from the storage.googleapis.com
repository and extract it into the installation directory:
wget -q -O- https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-profiler/java/latest/profiler_java_agent.tar.gz \
| sudo tar xzv -C /opt/cprof
GKE
Modify the Dockerfile to create an installation directory for the
Profiler agent, download the agent archive,
and then extract the archive into the installation directory.
Linux ( glibc -based C library):
Use the following installation command:
RUN mkdir -p /opt/cprof && \
wget -q -O- https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-profiler/java/latest/profiler_java_agent.tar.gz \
| tar xzv -C /opt/cprof
Linux Alpine ( musl -based C library):
Alpha
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Use the following installation command:
wget -q -O- https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-profiler/java/latest/profiler_java_agent_alpine.tar.gz \
| tar xzv -C /opt/cprof
Flexible Environment
When you use the Google
Java 8 runtime base image or
the Java 9 / Jetty 9 runtime
base image, the Profiler agent is pre-installed, so there
are no additional steps that you need to take to install the agent.
For all other base images, you need to install the agent. For example, the
following Dockerfile contains the instructions to use the
openjdk:11-slim image, to install the Profiler
agent, and it defines the default parameters to be used when starting the
application:
FROM openjdk:11-slim
COPY . .
RUN apt-get update \
&& apt-get install wget \
&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN mkdir -p /opt/cprof && \
wget -q -O- https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-profiler/java/latest/profiler_java_agent.tar.gz \
| tar xzv -C /opt/cprof
CMD [ "java" , "-agentpath:/opt/cprof/profiler_java_agent.so= OPTION1 , OPTION2 " , "-jar" , " PATH_TO_YOUR_JAR_FILE " ]
To use this Dockerfile with App Engine flexible environment, you need to
do the following:
Replace OPTION1 and OPTION2 with the
agent configuration values needed
for your application, and replace PATH_TO_YOUR_JAR_FILE with
the path to your jar file.
Place the Dockerfile in the same directory as your app.yaml file.
Modify your app.yaml file to specify a custom runtime. For more information, see Building Custom Runtimes .
Standard Environment
Note: The Java 8 runtime doesn't support GAE_PROFILER_MODE . To continue using the Profiler agent, you must migrate your application to the latest supported version of Java. To configure the Profiler agent for your second-generation Java application, see Starting your program .
When you use the Java runtime environment ,
the Profiler agent is pre-installed, so there are no
additional steps that you need to take to install the agent.
For Java version 11 and later, it is pre-installed in /opt/cprof .
Outside Google Cloud
Create an installation directory, for example, /opt/cprof , for the
Profiler agent:
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cprof
Download the agent archive from the storage.googleapis.com
repository and extract it into the installation directory:
wget -q -O- https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-profiler/java/latest/profiler_java_agent.tar.gz \
| sudo tar xzv -C /opt/cprof
To list all versions of the agent available for downloading,
run the following command:
gcloud storage ls gs://cloud-profiler/java/cloud-profiler-*
The command response is similar to the following:
gs://cloud-profiler/java/cloud-profiler-java-agent_20191014_RC00.tar.gz
gs://cloud-profiler/java/cloud-profiler-java-agent_20191021_RC00.tar.gz
gs://cloud-profiler/java/cloud-profiler-java-agent_20191028_RC00.tar.gz
To download a specific version of the agent, pass its URL to
the download command. For example, to download the agent built on 28 October
2019, you would use the following statement:
wget -q -O- https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-profiler/java/cloud-profiler-java-agent_20191028_RC00.tar.gz \
| sudo tar xzv -C /opt/cprof
The version of the agent is logged during its initialization.
Loading the Profiler agent
To profile your application, start Java as you normally would to run your
program, but specify the agent-configuration options. You specify the path to
the agent library, and you can pass options to the library.
For the App Engine standard environment, the agent is automatically loaded
and configured. Skip ahead to Starting your program ,
for details on configuring, and starting, your program.
Agent configuration
To configure the profiling agent, include the -agentpath flag when starting
your application:
- agentpath : INSTALL_DIR / profiler_java_agent . so = OPTION1 , OPTION2 , OPTION3
In this expression, INSTALL_DIR is the path to the profiling agent, while
OPTION1 , OPTION2 , and OPTION3 are agent configuration options. For
example, if you replace OPTION1 with -cprof_service= myapp in the previous
expression, then you set the service name to myapp . There is no restriction
on the number of options or their ordering. Supported configuration options
are listed in the following table:
Agent option
Description
-cprof_service
If your application isn't running on App Engine, then you must
use this configuration option to set the service name.
For service name restrictions, see
Service name and version arguments .
-cprof_service_version
When you want the ability to analyze profiling data using the
Profiler UI by the version of the service, use this option
to set the version. For version restrictions, see
Service name and version arguments .
-cprof_project_id
When you are running outside of Google Cloud, use this option to
specify your Google Cloud project ID. For more information,
see Profiling applications running outside of Google Cloud .
-cprof_zone_name
When your application is running on Google Cloud, the profiling agent
determines the zone by
communicating with the
Compute Engine metadata service .
If the profiling agent can't communicate with the metadata service, then you
need to use this option.
-cprof_gce_metadata_server_retry_count
-cprof_gce_metadata_server_retry_sleep_sec
Together, these two options define the retry policy that the profiler
agent uses when it communicates with the
Compute Engine metadata service .
to gather your Google Cloud project ID and zone information.
Default policy is to retry up to 3 times waiting 1 second between
attempts. This policy is sufficient for most configurations.
-cprof_cpu_use_per_thread_timers
For the most accurate CPU time profiles, set this option
to true. Use of this option results in increased per-thread overhead.
Default value is false.
-cprof_force_debug_non_safepoints
By default, the profiling agent forces JVM to generate debugging
information for all just in time (JIT) generated code, in addition
to generating debug information for all safepoints. This results in the
most accurate function and line-level location information for CPU time
and heap profiles at the expense of additional agent overhead. You can
disable the generation of debugging information for JIT code by setting
this option to false.
Default value is true.
-cprof_wall_num_threads_cutoff
By default, wall profiles aren't collected if the total number of threads
in the application exceeds 4096. The limit ensures that during profile
collection, the cost of traversing the stack of threads is minimal.
If your service normally has more than 4096 threads and if you want
to collect profiling data at the expense of additional overhead, use
this flag to increase limit.
Default limit is 4096 threads.
-cprof_enable_heap_sampling
To enable heap profiling for Java 11 and higher, set
-cprof_enable_heap_sampling=true .
Heap profiling isn't supported for Java 10 and lower.
Heap profiling is disabled by default.
When you enable heap profiling, the sampling interval is set to 512 KiB
by default. This interval is sufficient for most applications and incurs
less than 0.5% overhead for the application. Sampling intervals from
256 KiB (262144) to 1024 KiB (1048576) are supported.
For example, to set the sampling interval to 256 KiB, which doubles the
sampling rate, add the agent option:
-cprof_heap_sampling_interval=262144
Similarly, to set the sampling interval to 1024 KiB, which halves the
sampling rate, add the agent option:
-cprof_heap_sampling_interval=1048576
If you enable this profile type, then specify a new service version
when you deploy your application. For more information, see
Why don't I have data for a specific profile type?
Note: Simultaneous use of multiple
heap profilers disables all heap profiling support for Java. This is a
JVM limitation.
Service name and version arguments
When you load the Profiler agent, you specify a service-name argument and an
optional service-version argument to configure it.
Note: In the App Engine flexible environment, you do not have to specify
these arguments; they are derived from the environment.
The service name lets Profiler collect profiling data for all
replicas of that service. The profiler service ensures a
collection rate of one profile per minute, on average, for each service
name across each combination service versions and zones.
For example, if you have a service with two versions running across
replicas in three zones, the profiler will create an average of 6 profiles
per minute for that service.
If you use different service names for your replicas, then your service will
be profiled more often than necessary, with a correspondingly higher overhead.
When selecting a service name:
Choose a name that clearly represents the service in your application
architecture. The choice of service name is less important if you only run
a single service or application. It is more important if your application
runs as a set of micro-services, for example.
Make sure to not use any process-specific values, like a process ID,
in the service-name string.
The service-name string must match this regular expression:
^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9_.]{0,253}[a-z0-9])?$
A good guideline is to use a static string like imageproc-service as the
service name.
The service version is optional. If you specify the service version,
Profiler can aggregate profiling information from multiple
instances and display it correctly. It can be used to mark different versions
of your services as they get deployed. The Profiler UI lets you
filter the data by service version; this way, you can compare the performance
of older and newer versions of the code.
The value of the service-version argument is a free-form string, but values
for this argument typically look like version numbers, for example,
1.0.0 or 2.1.2 .
Starting your program
Compute Engine
Start Java as you normally would to run your program, and add the
the agent-configuration options:
java \
-agentpath:/opt/cprof/profiler_java_agent.so = -cprof_service = myapp ,-cprof_service_version = 1 .0.0 \
JAVA_OPTIONS -jar PATH_TO_YOUR_JAR_FILE PROGRAM_OPTIONS
GKE
Modify the service container Dockerfile to start Java as you normally
would to run your program, and add the agent-configuration options:
CMD [ "java" , \
"-agentpath:/opt/cprof/profiler_java_agent.so=-cprof_service= myapp ,-cprof_service_version=1.0.0" , \
"-jar" , " PATH_TO_YOUR_JAR_FILE " ]
Flexible Environment
Modify the app.yaml configuration file to
set the PROFILER_ENABLE environment variable. Then start
your program as usual:
env_variables:
PROFILER_ENABLE: true
See
Defining environment variables for more information.
Standard Environment
Java 21 runtime environment
If you don't use legacy bundled services, enable the profiler collection by modifying the
app.yaml file to specify the agentpath flag using
either of the following methods:
Set the
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable:
runtime: java21
env_variables:
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: "-agentpath:/opt/cprof/profiler_java_agent.so=-logtostderr,-cprof_enable_heap_sampling=true"
Specify the agentpath using the entrypoint element:
runtime: java21
entrypoint: java \
-agentpath:/opt/cprof/profiler_java_agent.so = -logtostderr,-cprof_enable_heap_sampling = true \
Main.java
If you use legacy bundled services, enable the profiler collection by modifying the
appengine-web.xml file to specify the agentpath flag
using either of the following methods:
Set the
JAVA_USER_OPTS environment variable:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0">
<env-variables>
<env-var name="JAVA_USER_OPTS" value="-agentpath:/opt/cprof/profiler_java_agent.so=-logtostderr,-cprof_enable_heap_sampling=true" />
</env-variables>
</appengine-web-app>
Set the
CPROF_ENABLE environment variable:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0">
<env-variables>
<env-var name="CPROF_ENABLE" value="-agentpath:/opt/cprof/profiler_java_agent.so=-logtostderr,-cprof_enable_heap_sampling=true" />
</env-variables>
</appengine-web-app>
Specify the agentpath using the
entrypoint element:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0">
<entrypoint>
java
-agentpath:/opt/cprof/profiler_java_agent.so=-logtostderr,-cprof_enable_heap_sampling=true
</entrypoint>
</appengine-web-app>
If a new profile type is configured for collection, ensure that you specify a
new service version when you deploy your application. For more information,
see Why don't I have data for a specific profile type?
Agent logging
The profiling agent can report logging information for
App Engine flexible environment, Compute Engine, and
GKE.
The profiling agent supports the following logging levels:
0 : Log all messages. Default logging level.
1 : Log warning, error, and fatal messages.
2 : Log error and fatal messages.
3 : Log only fatal messages and stop the application.
To enable writing logs to standard error with the default logging level,
append -logtostderr to the -agentpath configuration.
To set the logging level to log only error and fatal messages,
append -minloglevel=2 to the -agentpath configuration.
For example, to enable logging of error and fatal messages to standard error,
append -logtostderr and ‑minloglevel=2 to the
-agentpath configuration:
java - agentpath : / opt / cprof / profiler_java_agent . so =- cprof_service = myapp , - logtostderr , - minloglevel = 2 \
- jar myApp . jar
Troubleshooting
This section lists issues that are specific
to profiling Java applications. See Troubleshooting
for help with common problems.
Behavior
Cause
Solution
You've enabled multiple heap profilers and have no profile data.
Simultaneous use of multiple heap profilers disables all heap
profiling support for Java. This is a JVM limitation.
Enable 1 profiler.
Running with Linux Alpine
Alpha
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
The Java profiling agent for Linux Alpine is supported only for
Google Kubernetes Engine configurations.
To install the latest Java profiling agent for Linux Alpine, see
Installing the Profiler agent .
Authentication error
If you use Docker images that run with
Linux Alpine
(such as golang:alpine or just alpine ),
you might see the following authentication error:
connection error : desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided"
Note that to see the error you must have agent logging enabled.
The error indicates that the Docker images with Linux Alpine don't have the
root SSL certificates installed by default. Those certificates are necessary for
the profiling agent to communicate with the profiler API. To resolve
this error, add the following apk command to your Dockerfile:
FROM alpine
...
RUN apk add -- no - cache ca - certificates
You then need to rebuild and redeploy your application.
