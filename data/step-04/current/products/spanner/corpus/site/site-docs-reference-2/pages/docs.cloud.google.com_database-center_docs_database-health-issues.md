Database health issues
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Learn how Database Center helps you monitor and manage health
issues in your database fleet. Database Center organizes health
issues into industry-standard categories, such as cost, performance,
availability, data protection, and security. These categories help you identify
and address health issues. Addressing these health issues helps keep your
applications robust and secure. You can customize which health issues
Database Center displays for your organization.
To help you find health issues in specific areas, health issues are categorized
by the following:
Tier, such as Built-in, Gemini, and Security Command Center
Category, such as cost, data protection, and security
Database product, such as Spanner, and Bigtable.
The
health issues dashboard
displays all health issues in your database fleet. Use the dashboard's filters
to find specific health issues.
Resources and database groups
Database Center health issues are associated with a database
resource . In Google Cloud, resources are the fundamental
components that make up Google Cloud applications. Database resources
include individual units of compute or storage, such as clusters, virtual
machines, and instances, as well as parent resources such as projects and
folders. For example, in Cloud SQL, an instance and a read replica are
resources, and in AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, a cluster is a resource. A
database group refers to the database resources that are used in a
Google Cloud database application. For example, in Cloud SQL, one
database group includes a primary instance and the read replica instances that
are associated with it.
Health issue categories
To help you view the most important aspects of your database fleet health at a
glance, Database Center organizes health issues into
industry-standard categories including cost, performance and capacity,
availability, data protection, security, and industry compliance.
A database health issue is any topic that you want to monitor to ensure that
your fleet is healthy and that your applications are robust and secure.
You can customize which databases and health issues
Database Center displays. When you customize health issues, your
customizations only apply to your view of the organization. Health issue
customizations are saved at the per-user level.
Health issue categories are described as follows:
Health issue category
Description
Availability configuration
Availability issues track resource configurations that affect
durability, fault tolerance, and downtime.
Cost
Cost issues help you optimize your database fleet for
cost-saving opportunities.
Data protection
Data protection issues help you ensure the following:
Your data is properly backed up.
You store backups for a sufficient period of time.
There are no gaps in your overall data protection strategy.
Cloud SQL is protected by Backup and DR Service
Security
Security issues help you perform the following types of
tasks:
Identify security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
Identify and address cyber security risks.
Detect threats to your Google Cloud database resources.
Monitor and manage regulatory compliance.
Note: Database Center doesn't check for
issues that are dependent on Security Command Center unless you have
the Built-in or Premium tier enabled. If Security Command Center isn't
enabled, then all issue checks display as passing in the user
interface.
Industry compliance
Industry compliance issues help you ensure that the database
resources in your organization are compliant with common industry
standards. Database Center helps you monitor compliance for the following industry standards:
CIS Google Cloud Foundation 2.0
CIS Google Cloud Foundation 1.3
CIS Google Cloud Foundation 1.2
CIS Google Cloud Foundation 1.1
CIS Google Cloud Foundation 1.0
NIST 800-53
ISO-27001
PCI-DSS v3.2.1
Performance and capacity
Performance and capacity issues help you determine if your
resource usage is putting your database performance at risk. These
issues highlight the following:
Instances with high CPU or memory utilization.
Instances that are running low on storage capacity.
Databases with a large number of tables or high table utilization
Temporary tables affecting database performance
Other
Other issues include miscellaneous configurations that can help
you with the following:
Query troubleshooting, like "query durations not logged"
Errors and logging scope, like "verbose error logging"
Settings related to connections and users, like "connection
attempts not logged"
Health issue tiers
Supported health issues are in one of three tiers:
Built-in : included by default with Database Center
Gemini : requires you to enable Gemini Cloud Assist.
Security Command Center (SCC) : requires you to enable the Security Command Center
Database Center doesn't check for issues that are
dependent on Security Command Center (SCC) or Gemini Cloud Assist
unless you have the specific tiers enabled. If Security Command Center or
Gemini Cloud Assist aren't enabled, then all issue checks display as
passing in the user interface.
For more information on how to enable the Gemini Cloud Assist or
Security Command Center tiers, see
