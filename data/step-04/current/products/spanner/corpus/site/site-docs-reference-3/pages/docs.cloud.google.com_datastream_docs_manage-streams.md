Manage streams
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In this page, you learn how to use the Datastream API to:
Create streams
Get information about streams and stream objects
Update streams by starting, pausing, resuming, and modifying them, as well as by initiating and stopping backfill for stream objects
Recover permanently failed streams
Enable streaming of large objects for Oracle streams
Delete streams
There are two ways that you can use the Datastream API. You can make REST API calls or you can use the Google Cloud CLI (CLI).
For high-level information about using Google Cloud CLI to manage Datastream streams, see gcloud CLI Datastream streams .
Refer to the Using Datastream APIs tutorial to see an end-to-end walkthrough of how to use Datastream's APIs to create and manage streams.
Create a stream
In this section, you learn how to create a stream that's used to transfer data from your source to a destination. The examples that follow aren't comprehensive, but rather highlight specific features of Datastream. To address your specific use case, use these examples together with the Datastream API reference documentation .
This section covers the following use cases:
Stream from Oracle to Cloud Storage
Stream from MySQL to BigQuery
Stream from PostgreSQL to BigQuery
Define a set of objects to include in the stream
Backfill all objects included in the stream
Exclude objects from the stream
Exclude objects from the backfill
Define CMEK for encrypting data at rest
Define write mode for a stream
Stream to a different project in BigQuery
Stream data to BigLake managed tables
Example 1: Stream specific objects to BigQuery
In this example, you learn how to:
Stream from MySQL to BigQuery
Include a set of objects in the stream
Define write mode for the stream as append-only
Backfill all objects included in the stream
The following is a request to pull all tables from schema1 and two specific
tables from schema2 : tableA and tableC . The events are written to a dataset
in BigQuery.
The request doesn't include the customerManagedEncryptionKey parameter, therefore
the Google Cloud internal key management system is used to encrypt your data
instead of CMEK.
The backfillAll parameter associated with performing the historical
backfill (or snapshot) is set to an empty dictionary ( {} ), which means that
Datastream backfills the historical data from all tables included in the stream.
REST

gcloud
For more information about using gcloud to create a stream, see Google Cloud SDK documentation .
Example 2: Exclude specific objects from a stream with a PostgreSQL source
In this example, you learn how to:
Stream from PostgreSQL to BigQuery
Exclude objects from the stream
Exclude objects from the backfill
The following code shows a request to create a stream that's used to transfer data from a source PostgreSQL database to BigQuery.
When creating a stream from a source PostgreSQL database, you need to specify two additional, PostgreSQL-specific fields in your request:
replicationSlot : a replication slot is a prerequisite for configuring a PostgreSQL database for replication. You need to create a replication slot for each stream.
publication : a publication is a group of tables that you want to replicate changes from. The publication name must exist in the database before starting a stream. At a minimum, the publication has to include the tables specified in the stream's includeObjects list.
The backfillAll parameter associated with performing the historical backfill (or snapshot) is set to exclude one table.

}
}
}
gcloud
For more information about using gcloud to create a stream, see Google Cloud SDK documentation .
Example 3: Specify append-only write mode for a stream
When streaming to BigQuery, you can define the write mode: merge or
appendOnly . For more information, see Configure write mode .
If you don't specify the write mode in your request to create a stream, the default
merge mode is used.
The following request shows how to define the appendOnly mode when you create
a MySQL to BigQuery stream.
REST
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProjectId1/locations/us-central1/ streams?streamId=appendOnlyStream

Example 4: Stream to a different project in BigQuery
If you created your Datastream resources in one project, but want to
stream to a different project in BigQuery, then you can do that using
a request similar to the one that follows.
If you specify sourceHierarchyDatasets for your destination dataset, then
you need to populate the projectId field.
If you specify singleTargetDataset for your destination dataset, then
populate the datasetId field in the projectId:datasetId format.
REST
For sourceHierarchyDatasets :
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProjectId1/locations/us-central1/ streams?streamId=crossProjectBqStream1
{
"displayName" : "My cross-project stream" ,
"sourceConfig" : {

}
]
}
}
},
"destinationConfig" : {
"destinationConnectionProfileName" : "BigQueryCp" ,
"bigqueryDestinationConfig" : {
"sourceHierarchyDatasets" : {
"datasetTemplate" : {
"location" : "us" ,
"datasetIdPrefix" : "prefix_"
},
"projectId" : "myProjectId2"
}
}
},
"backfillAll" : {}
}
For singleTargetDataset :
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProjectId1/locations/us-central1/ streams?streamId=crossProjectBqStream2
{
"displayName" : "My cross-project stream" ,
"sourceConfig" : {

}
}
},
"destinationConfig" : {
"destinationConnectionProfileName" : "BigQueryCp" ,
"bigqueryDestinationConfig" : {
"singleTargetDataset" : {
"datasetId" : "myProjectId2:myDatasetId"
},
}
},
"backfillAll" : {}
}
gcloud
For sourceHierarchyDatasets :
datastream streams create crossProjectBqStream1 --location = us-central1
--display-name = my-cross-project-stream --source = source-cp --mysql-source-config = mysql_source_config.json
--destination = destination-cp --bigquery-destination-config = source_hierarchy_cross_project_config.json
--backfill-none
The contents of the source_hierarchy_cross_project_config.json configuration file:
{ "sourceHierarchyDatasets" : { "datasetTemplate" : { "location" : "us-central1" , "datasetIdPrefix" : "prefix_" }, "projectId" : "myProjectId2" }}
For singleTargetDataset :
datastream streams create crossProjectBqStream --location = us-central1
--display-name = my-cross-project-stream --source = source-cp --mysql-source-config = mysql_source_config.json
--destination = destination-cp --bigquery-destination-config = single_target_cross_project_config.json
--backfill-none
The contents of the single_target_cross_project_config.json configuration file:
{ "singleTargetDataset" : { "datasetId" : "myProjectId2:myDatastetId" }}
For more information about using gcloud to create a stream, see Google Cloud SDK documentation .
Example 5: Stream to a Cloud Storage destination
In this example, you learn how to:
Stream from Oracle to Cloud Storage
Define a set of objects to include in the stream
Define CMEK for encrypting data at rest
The following request shows how to create a stream that writes the events to a bucket in Cloud Storage.
In this example request, the events are written in the JSON output format, and a new file is created every 100 MB or 30 seconds (overriding the default values of 50 MB and 60 seconds).
For the JSON format, you can:
Include a unified types schema file in the path. As a result, Datastream writes two files to Cloud Storage: a JSON data file and an Avro schema file. The schema file has the same name as the data file, with a .schema extension.
Enable gzip compression to have Datastream compress the files that are written to Cloud Storage.
By using the backfillNone parameter, the request specifies that only ongoing changes are streamed into the destination, with no backfill.
The request specifies the customer-managed encryption key parameter which lets you control the keys used to encrypt data at rest within a Google Cloud project. The parameter refers to the CMEK that Datastream uses to encrypt data that's streamed from the source to the destination. It also specifies the key ring for your CMEK.
For more information about key rings, see Cloud KMS resources . For more information about protecting your data using encryption keys, see Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) .

Example 6: Stream to a BigLake managed table
In this example, you learn how to configure a stream to replicate data from a
MySQL database to a BigLake Iceberg table in append-only mode.
Before you create the request, make sure that you've completed the following
steps:
Have a Cloud Storage bucket where you want to store your data
Create a Cloud resource connection
Grant your Cloud resource connection access to the Cloud Storage bucket
You can then use the following request to create your stream:
REST
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProjectId1/locations/us-central1/ streams?streamId=mysqlBigLakeStream

Validate the definition of a stream
Before creating a stream, you can validate its definition. This way, you can ensure that all validation checks pass, and that the stream will run successfully when created.
Validating a stream checks:
Whether the source is configured properly to allow Datastream to stream data from it.
Whether the stream can connect to both the source and the destination.
The end-to-end configuration of the stream.
To validate a stream, add &validate_only=true to the URL preceding the body of your request:
POST "https://datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION / streams?streamId= STREAM_ID &validate_only=true "
After you make this request, you'll see the validation checks that Datastream runs for your source and destination, along with whether the checks pass or fail. For any validation check that doesn't pass, information appears as to why it failed and what to do to rectify the problem.
For example, suppose you have a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) that you want Datastream to use to encrypt data that's streamed from the source to the destination. As part of validating the stream, Datastream will verify that the key exists, and that Datastream has permissions to use the key. If either of these conditions aren't met, then when you validate the stream, the following error message will be returned:
CMEK_DOES_NOT_EXIST_OR_MISSING_PERMISSIONS
To resolve this issue, verify that the key that you provided exists, and that the Datastream service account has the cloudkms.cryptoKeys.get permission for the key.
After making the appropriate corrections, make the request again to ensure that all validation checks pass. For the preceding example, the CMEK_VALIDATE_PERMISSIONS check will no longer return an error message, but will have a status of PASSED .
To learn more about the validation checks that Datastream runs for your source and destination, see Create a stream .
For more information about the customerManagedEncryptionKey parameter, see Create a stream .
Get information about a stream
The following code shows a request to retrieve information about a stream. This information includes:
The stream's name (unique identifier)
A user-friendly name for the stream (display name)

For more information about using gcloud to list objects of a stream, see the Google Cloud SDK documentation .
Start a stream
The following code shows a request to start a stream.
By using the updateMask parameter in the request, only the fields that you specify have to be included in the body of the request. To start a stream, change the value in the state field from CREATED to RUNNING .
When a stream is started, the status first changes to STARTING . This signifies that the stream is in the process of being started and validated.
If the stream is valid, then the status of the stream changes from STARTING to RUNNING .
If the stream isn't valid, then the status of the stream changes from STARTING back to CREATED . There will be errors that you can address to rectify the problems of the stream . For example, if errors are associated with the connectivity information of the stream, then modify the stream definition. After resolving all problems of the stream, start it again, and the status changes to STARTING , and then to RUNNING .
REST
PATCH h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/
LOCATION /s trea ms/ STREAM_ID ?upda te Mask=s tate
{
"state" : "RUNNING"
}
gcloud
For more information about using gcloud to start your stream, see the Google Cloud SDK documentation .
If you want to start a stream without validating it, then add &force=true to the request.
For example: PATCH https://datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProjectId1/locations/
us-central1/streams/myOracleCdcStream?updateMask=state &force=true
Pause a stream
The following code shows a request to pause a running stream.
For this example, the field specified for the updateMask parameter is the state field. By pausing the stream, you're changing its state from RUNNING to PAUSED .
When a stream is paused, Datastream won't pull any new data from the source database into the destination. However, some data may continue to be written to the destination because "in flight" data will continue to flow.
Therefore, after you pause a stream, the status of the stream changes from RUNNING to DRAINING . Draining a stream is the process of emptying the stream so that it doesn't contain any data. After the stream is drained of all data, then the status of the stream changes from DRAINING to PAUSED .
REST
PATCH h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/
LOCATION /s trea ms/ STREAM_ID ?upda te Mask=s tate
{
"state" : "PAUSED"
}
gcloud
For more information about using gcloud to pause your stream, see the Google Cloud SDK documentation .
Resume a stream
The following code shows a request to resume a paused stream.
For this example, the field specified for the updateMask parameter is the state field. By resuming the stream, you're changing its state from PAUSED to RUNNING .
REST
PATCH h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/
LOCATION /s trea ms/ STREAM_ID ?upda te Mask=s tate
{
"state" : "RUNNING"
}
gcloud
For more information about using gcloud to resume your stream, see the Google Cloud SDK documentation .
Recover a stream
You can recover a permanently failed stream using the RunStream method. Each
source database type has its own definition of what stream recovery operations
are possible. For more information, see Recover a stream .
Recover a stream for a MySQL or an Oracle source
The following code samples show requests to recover a stream for a MySQL or an
Oracle source from various log file positions:
REST
Recover a stream from the current position. This is the default option:
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/
LOCATION /s trea ms/ STREAM_ID : ru n
Recover a stream from the next available position:
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/
LOCATION /s trea ms/ STREAM_ID : ru n
{
"cdcStrategy" : {
"nextAvailableStartPosition" : {}
}
}
Recover a stream from the most recent position:
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/
LOCATION /s trea ms/ STREAM_ID : ru n
{
"cdcStrategy" : {
"mostRecentStartPosition" : {}
}
}
Recover a stream from a specific position (MySQL binlog-based replication):
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/
LOCATION /s trea ms/ STREAM_ID : ru n
{
"cdcStrategy" : {
"specificStartPosition" : {
"mysqlLogPosition" : {
"logFile" : " NAME_OF_THE_LOG_FILE "
"logPosition" : POSITION
}
}
}
}
Replace the following:
NAME_OF_THE_LOG_FILE : The name of the log file from which you want
to recover your stream
POSITION : The position in the log file from which you want to
recover your stream. If you don't provide the value, Datastream recovers
the stream from the head of the file.
For example:
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myProjectId1/locations/
us - ce ntral 1 /s trea ms/myS trea mId 1 : ru n
{
"cdcStrategy" : {

Start or resume a stream from a specific position
You can start a stream or resume a paused stream from a specific position for
MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server sources. This might be useful when you want to
perform backfill using an external tool, or start CDC from a position that you
indicate:
For a MySQL source, you need to indicate a binlog position or a GTID set.
For an Oracle source, you need to indicate a system change number (SCN) in
the redo log file.
For a SQL Server source, you need to indicate a log sequence number (LSN) in
a change table.
The following code shows example requests to start or resume an already created
stream from a specific position.
Start or resume a stream from a specific binlog position (MySQL):

gcloud
For more information about using gcloud to modify your stream, see the Google Cloud SDK documentation .
Initiate backfill for an object of a stream
A stream in Datastream can backfill historical data, as well as stream ongoing changes into a destination. Ongoing changes will always be streamed from a source into a destination. However, you can specify whether you want historical data to be streamed.
If you want historical data to be streamed from the source into the destination, then use the backfillAll parameter.
Datastream also lets you stream historical data only for specific database tables. To do this, use the backfillAll parameter, and exclude the tables for which you don't want historical data.
If you want only ongoing changes to be streamed into the destination, then use the backfillNone parameter. If you then want Datastream to stream a snapshot of all existing data from the source to the destination, you must initiate backfill manually for the objects that contain this data.
Another reason for initiating backfill for an object is if data is out of sync between the source and the destination. For example, a user can delete data in the destination inadvertently, and the data is now lost. In this case, initiating backfill for the object serves as a "reset mechanism" because all data is streamed into the destination in one shot. As a result, the data is synced between the source and the destination.
Before you can initiate backfill for an object of a stream, you must retrieve information about the object .
Each object has an OBJECT_ID , which uniquely identifies the object. You use the OBJECT_ID to initiate backfill for the stream.
REST
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/
LOCATION /s trea ms/ STREAM_ID /objec ts / OBJECT_ID : s tart Back f illJob
gcloud
For more information about using gcloud to initiate backfill for an object of your stream, see the Google Cloud SDK documentation .
Stop backfill for an object of a stream
After initiating backfill for an object of a stream , you can stop backfill for the object. For example, if a user modifies a database schema, then the schema or data may be corrupted. You don't want this schema or data to be streamed into the destination, and so you stop backfill for the object.
You can also stop backfill for an object for load balancing purposes. Datastream can run multiple backfills in parallel. This may put an additional load on the source. If the load is significant, stop backfill for each object, and then initiate backfill for the objects, one by one.
Before you can stop backfill for an object of a stream, you must make a request to retrieve information about all objects of a stream . Each object that's returned has an OBJECT_ID , which uniquely identifies the object. You use the OBJECT_ID to stop backfill for the stream.
REST
POST h tt ps : //datastream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/
LOCATION /s trea ms/ STREAM_ID /objec ts / OBJECT_ID : s t opBack f illJob

Change the number of maximum concurrent CDC tasks
Note: This configuration is only available for MySQL and Oracle sources.
The following code shows how to set the number of maximum concurrent change data capture (CDC) tasks for a MySQL stream to 7.
For this example, the field specified for the updateMask parameter is the maxConcurrentCdcTasks field. By setting its value to 7, you're changing the number of maximum concurrent CDC tasks from the previous value to 7. You can use values from 0 to 50 (inclusive). If you don't define the value, or if you define it as 0, the system default of 5 tasks is set for the stream.

The following code shows how to set the number of maximum concurrent backfill tasks for a MySQL stream to 25.
For this example, the field specified for the updateMask parameter is the maxConcurrentBackfillTasks field. By setting its value to 25, you're changing the number of maximum concurrent backfill tasks from the previous value to 25. You can use values from 0 to 50 (inclusive). If you don't define the value, or if you define it as 0, the system default of 16 tasks is set for the stream.

Enable streaming of large objects for Oracle sources
You can enable streaming of large objects, such as binary large objects ( BLOB ),
character large objects ( CLOB ) and national character large objects ( NCLOB )
for streams with Oracle sources. The streamLargeObjects flag lets you include
large objects both in new and existing streams. The flag is set on stream level,
you don't need to specify the columns of large object data types.
The following example shows how to create a stream that lets you stream large
objects.
