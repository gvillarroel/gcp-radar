Stream concurrency controls
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides an overview of stream concurrency controls, such as the maximum
number of concurrent change data capture (CDC) tasks and backfill tasks. You can
control stream performance by increasing or decreasing the values of these parameters.
Concurrency controls overview
By using the concurrency controls, you can either achieve faster backfill and CDC,
or balance the load on the source database. If you require higher throughputs,
and can afford a higher load on the database, then you can increase the concurrency
of CDC and backfill tasks. Conversely, if your database is experiencing a high
load, and you want to protect it from being overloaded, then you can reduce the
values of these parameters.
Note: The maximum number of concurrent CDC and backfill tasks parameters are
independent of each other. Because of the potential impact that the parameters
can have on the source database, we recommend that you modify their values
incrementally to see how your system responds.
Maximum number of CDC tasks
Note: This configuration is only available for MySQL and Oracle sources. CDC in
PostgreSQL and SQL Server is single-threaded. For information about how to
overcome this limitation for PostgreSQL, see
Diagnose issues .
The maxConcurrentCdcTasks parameter lets you control the number of CDC
tasks that a stream runs in parallel. To extend the CDC throughput, increase the
value of this parameter and allow Datastream to process more CDC log files
at the same time.
The key characteristics of the parameter include:
The default value is 5 . You can set this parameter to any value between
1 and 50 , inclusive.
The parameter is applicable only to Oracle and MySQL sources.
The parameter has impact only if there are more database log files available
to read than there are CDC tasks. The log files settings are controlled by
the source database configuration parameters: the maximum log file size and
the maximum log rotation time interval. For more information about these
parameters, refer to Oracle and MySQL documentation.
If you decrease the number of concurrent CDC tasks, Datastream might
lag behind the database logs, which might eventually lead to log position loss
and stream failure.
Maximum number of backfill tasks
The maxConcurrentBackfillTasks parameter lets you control the number of backfill
tasks that a stream can run in parallel. You can increase or decrease this value
to control the backfill throughput.
The key characteristics of the parameter include:
The default value is 15 . You can set this parameter to any value between
1 and 50 , inclusive.
There is a high risk associated with increasing the backfill concurrency,
because backfill tasks have significant impact on the database performance.
Each backfill task runs an unfiltered SELECT query on a table, and for
large tables, such queries return a large number of rows.
If you decrease the backfill concurrency, it has no negative impact on the
source database except for the backfill taking a longer time to complete.
Change the values of concurrency controls
You can change the values of concurrency control parameters using the
Datastream API.
