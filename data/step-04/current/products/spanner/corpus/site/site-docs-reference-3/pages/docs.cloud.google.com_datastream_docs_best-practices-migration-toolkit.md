Datastream BigQuery Migration Toolkit
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes best practices when using Datastream to migrate from
the Dataflow Datastream to BigQuery template
to the Datastream built-in BigQuery replication solution .
Before you begin
The instructions on this page assume the following:
You are familiar with, and have installed Docker .
You know how to clone repositories from services like GitHub.
You know how to run streams in Datastream.
You have installed the Google Cloud CLI .
Migration toolkit overview
The Datastream BigQuery Migration Toolkit is an open source
software offered by Google Cloud. The toolkit lets you migrate off the Dataflow
Datastream to BigQuery template ,
but you can also use it when migrating from other pipelines, as explained in the
Migrate from other pipelines section that follows.
To migrate your BigQuery tables using the toolkit, you need to perform
the following steps:
Create, start and pause a Datastream stream with a BigQuery
destination.
Run the migration on each BigQuery table that needs to be migrated.
Resume the stream.
The toolkit does the following:
Retrieves the source table schema using the Datastream
discover API .
Creates a Datastream-compatible BigQuery table based on the
retrieved schema.
Fetches the schema of the BigQuery table from which you're migrating
to determine the necessary data type conversions.
Copies all existing rows from the original table to the new table, including
appropriate column type casts .
For more information about the way the toolkit is structured, and the arguments
it uses, see the toolkit README.md file .
Set up the migration toolkit
To run the migration toolkit using Docker, perform the following steps:
Clone the repository and change directory into it:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/datastream-bigquery-migration-toolkit &&
cd datastream-bigquery-migration-toolkit
Build the image:
docker build -t migration-service .
Authenticate with your Google Cloud CLI credentials:
docker run -ti \
--name gcloud-config migration-service gcloud auth application-default login
Set your Google Cloud project property:
docker run -ti --volumes-from gcloud-config migration-service \
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the identifier of your Google Cloud
project.
Migrate from Dataflow to the Datastream built-in solution
Create a Datastream stream with a BigQuery destination
Note: When configuring the source, make sure to choose manual backfill
under Choose backfill mode for historical data .
Start the stream, and immediately pause it. This allows Datastream
to capture the position from which it captures changes before the migration starts.
Note: Between starting and pausing, Datastream might processes some
events and create one or more tables in BigQuery. In such a case,
you must manually delete the tables in BigQuery before proceeding
with the migration, otherwise the migration fails.
Drain the Datastream and Dataflow pipeline:
Pause the existing Cloud Storage destination stream.
Check the total latency metric for the stream and wait for at least as long as
the current latency to ensure that any in-flight events are written to the
destination.
Drain the Dataflow job .
Execute the migration:
Run the migration in dry_run mode. The dry_run mode lets you generate
the CREATE TABLE DDL statement and the SQL statement for copying data,
without executing them:
docker run -v output:/output -ti --volumes-from gcloud-config \
migration-service python3 ./migration/migrate_table.py dry_run \
--project-id PROJECT_ID \
--stream-id STREAM_ID \
--datastream-region STREAM_REGION \
--source-schema-name SOURCE_SCHEMA_NAME \
--source-table-name SOURCE_TABLE_NAME \
--bigquery-source-dataset-name BIGQUERY_SOURCE_DATASET_NAME \
--bigquery-source-table-name BIGQUERY_SOURCE_TABLE_NAME
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The unique identifier of your Google Cloud
project.
STREAM_ID : The unique identifier of your BigQuery
destination stream.
STREAM_REGION : The location of your stream, for example us-central1 .
SOURCE_SCHEMA_NAME : The name of the source schema.
SOURCE_TABLE_NAME : The name of the source table.
BIGQUERY_SOURCE_DATASET_NAME : The name of the existing BigQuery
dataset.
BIGQUERY_SOURCE_TABLE_NAME : The name of the existing BigQuery
table.
Inspect the .sql files under output/create_target_table and output/copy_rows .
These are the SQL commands that will be executed in your Google Cloud project:
docker run -v output:/output -ti migration-service find output/create_target_table \
-type f -print -exec cat {} \;
docker run -v output:/output -ti migration-service find output/copy_rows \
-type f -print -exec cat {} \;
To execute the SQL commands, run the migration in full mode. The full
mode lets you create a table in BigQuery and copy all rows from the
existing BigQuery table:
docker run -v output:/output -ti --volumes-from gcloud-config \
migration-service python3 ./migration/migrate_table.py full \
--project-id PROJECT_ID \
--stream-id STREAM_ID \
--datastream-region STREAM_REGION \
--source-schema-name SOURCE_SCHEMA_NAME \
--source-table-name SOURCE_TABLE_NAME \
--bigquery-source-dataset-name BIGQUERY_SOURCE_DATASET_NAME \
--bigquery-source-table-name BIGQUERY_SOURCE_TABLE_NAME
Resume the paused stream.
Open the Google Cloud Logs Explorer, and look for Datastream logs
with the following query:
resource.type = "datastream.googleapis.com/Stream"
resource.labels.stream_id = STREAM_ID
Look for the following log, where %d is a number:
Completed writing %d records into..
This log indicates that the new stream successfully loaded data into BigQuery.
It only appears if there is CDC data to load.
Migrate from other pipelines
The toolkit also lets you migrate from other pipelines to the Datastream
built-in BigQuery solution.
The toolkit can generate CREATE TABLE DDLs for Datastream-compatible
BigQuery tables, based on the source database schema by using the
dry_run mode:
docker run -v output:/output -ti --volumes-from gcloud-config \
migration-service python3 ./migration/migrate_table.py dry_run \
--project-id PROJECT_ID \
--stream-id STREAM_ID \
--datastream-region STREAM_REGION \
--source-schema-name SOURCE_SCHEMA_NAME \
--source-table-name SOURCE_TABLE_NAME \
--bigquery-source-dataset-name BIGQUERY_SOURCE_DATASET_NAME \
--bigquery-source-table-name BIGQUERY_SOURCE_TABLE_NAME
Because the BigQuery table schemas might vary, it is difficult to provide
a universal SQL statement for copying rows. You can use the schemas in the source
table DDL directory ( output/source_table_ddl ) and the destination table DDL
directory ( output/create_target_table ) to create a SQL statement with appropriate
casts on the source
columns.
The following is an example SQL statement format that you can use:
INSERT INTO DESTINATION_TABLE ( DESTINATION_COLUMN1 , DESTINATION_COLUMN2 ...)
SELECT SOURCE_COLUMN1 , SOURCE_COLUMN2
FROM SOURCE_TABLE ;
Replace the following:
DESTINATION_TABLE : The name of your destination table in BigQuery.
DESTINATION_COLUMN : The name of the column in your destination
table.
SOURCE_COLUMN : The name of the column in your source table.
SOURCE_TABLE : The name of your source table.
Limitations
The toolkit has the following limitations:
The column names in the existing and new BigQuery tables need to match
(ignoring metadata columns). The migration fails if you apply Dataflow
user-defined functions
(UDFs) that change the names of the columns in the existing tables (for example,
by adding a prefix or changing case).
Cross-region and cross-project migrations aren't supported.
The migration works on a per-table basis.
Only Oracle and MySQL sources are supported.
