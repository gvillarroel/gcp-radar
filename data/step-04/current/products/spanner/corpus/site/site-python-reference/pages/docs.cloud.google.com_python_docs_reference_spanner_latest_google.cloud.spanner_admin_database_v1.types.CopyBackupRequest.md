Required. The id of the backup copy. The backup_id
appended to parent forms the full backup_uri of the form

Required. The source backup to be copied. The source backup
needs to be in READY state for it to be copied. Once
CopyBackup is in progress, the source backup cannot be
deleted or cleaned up on expiration until CopyBackup is
finished. Values are of the form:
