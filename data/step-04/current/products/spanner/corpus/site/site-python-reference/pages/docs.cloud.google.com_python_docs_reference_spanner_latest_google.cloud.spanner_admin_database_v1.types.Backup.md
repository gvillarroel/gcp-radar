Backup ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
A backup of a Cloud Spanner database.
Attributes
Name
Description
database
str
Required for the
CreateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup]
operation. Name of the database from which this backup was
created. This needs to be in the same instance as the
backup. Values are of the form
projects/ .
version_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
The backup will contain an externally consistent copy of the
database at the timestamp specified by version_time . If
version_time is not specified, the system will set
version_time to the create_time of the backup.
expire_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Required for the
CreateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup]
operation. The expiration time of the backup, with
microseconds granularity that must be at least 6 hours and
at most 366 days from the time the CreateBackup request is
processed. Once the expire_time has passed, the backup
is eligible to be automatically deleted by Cloud Spanner to
free the resources used by the backup.
name
str
Output only for the
CreateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup]
operation. Required for the
UpdateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.UpdateBackup]
operation.
A globally unique identifier for the backup which cannot be
changed. Values are of the form
projects/
The final segment of the name must be between 2 and 60
characters in length.
The backup is stored in the location(s) specified in the
instance configuration of the instance containing the
backup, identified by the prefix of the backup name of the
form projects/ .
create_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. The time the
CreateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup]
request is received. If the request does not specify
version_time , the version_time of the backup will be
equivalent to the create_time .
size_bytes
int
Output only. Size of the backup in bytes.
freeable_size_bytes
int
Output only. The number of bytes that will be
freed by deleting this backup. This value will
be zero if, for example, this backup is part of
an incremental backup chain and younger backups
in the chain require that we keep its data. For
backups not in an incremental backup chain, this
is always the size of the backup. This value may
change if backups on the same chain get created,
deleted or expired.
exclusive_size_bytes
int
Output only. For a backup in an incremental
backup chain, this is the storage space needed
to keep the data that has changed since the
previous backup. For all other backups, this is
always the size of the backup. This value may
change if backups on the same chain get deleted
or expired.
This field can be used to calculate the total
storage space used by a set of backups. For
example, the total space used by all backups of
a database can be computed by summing up this
field.
state
google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.Backup.State
Output only. The current state of the backup.
referencing_databases
MutableSequence[str]
Output only. The names of the restored databases that
reference the backup. The database names are of the form
projects/ .
Referencing databases may exist in different instances. The
existence of any referencing database prevents the backup
from being deleted. When a restored database from the backup
enters the READY state, the reference to the backup is
removed.
encryption_info
google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.EncryptionInfo
Output only. The encryption information for
the backup.
encryption_information
MutableSequence[ google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.EncryptionInfo ]
Output only. The encryption information for the backup,
whether it is protected by one or more KMS keys. The
information includes all Cloud KMS key versions used to
encrypt the backup. The
encryption_status' field inside of each \ EncryptionInfo\`
is not populated. At least one of the key versions must be
available for the backup to be restored. If a key version is
revoked in the middle of a restore, the restore behavior is
undefined.
database_dialect
google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.DatabaseDialect
Output only. The database dialect information
for the backup.
referencing_backups
MutableSequence[str]
Output only. The names of the destination backups being
created by copying this source backup. The backup names are
of the form
projects/ .
Referencing backups may exist in different instances. The
existence of any referencing backup prevents the backup from
being deleted. When the copy operation is done (either
successfully completed or cancelled or the destination
backup is deleted), the reference to the backup is removed.
max_expire_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. The max allowed expiration time of the backup,
with microseconds granularity. A backup's expiration time
can be configured in multiple APIs: CreateBackup,
UpdateBackup, CopyBackup. When updating or copying an
existing backup, the expiration time specified must be less
than Backup.max_expire_time .
backup_schedules
MutableSequence[str]
Output only. List of backup schedule URIs
that are associated with creating this backup.
This is only applicable for scheduled backups,
and is empty for on-demand backups.
To optimize for storage, whenever possible,
multiple schedules are collapsed together to
create one backup. In such cases, this field
captures the list of all backup schedule URIs
that are associated with creating this backup.
If collapsing is not done, then this field
captures the single backup schedule URI
associated with creating this backup.
incremental_backup_chain_id
str
Output only. Populated only for backups in an incremental
backup chain. Backups share the same chain id if and only if
they belong to the same incremental backup chain. Use this
field to determine which backups are part of the same
incremental backup chain. The ordering of backups in the
chain can be determined by ordering the backup
version_time .
oldest_version_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. Data deleted at a time older
than this is guaranteed not to be retained in
order to support this backup. For a backup in an
incremental backup chain, this is the version
time of the oldest backup that exists or ever
existed in the chain. For all other backups,
this is the version time of the backup. This
field can be used to understand what data is
being retained by the backup system.
instance_partitions
MutableSequence[ google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.BackupInstancePartition ]
Output only. The instance partition(s) storing the backup.
This is the same as the list of the instance partition(s)
that the database had footprint in at the backup's
version_time .
Classes
State
State ( value )
Indicates the current state of the backup.
