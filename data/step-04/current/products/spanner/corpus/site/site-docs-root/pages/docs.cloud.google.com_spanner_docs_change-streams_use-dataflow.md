Build change streams connections using Dataflow
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page demonstrates how to create Dataflow pipelines that
consume and forward Spanner change data by using
change streams . You can use the example code on this page to
build custom pipelines.
Core concepts
The following are some core concepts for Dataflow pipelines for
change streams.
Dataflow
Dataflow
is a serverless, fast, and cost-effective service that supports both stream and
batch processing. It provides portability with processing jobs written using the
open source
Apache Beam
libraries and automates infrastructure provisioning and cluster management.
Dataflow provides near real-time streaming when reading from change streams.
You can use Dataflow to consume Spanner change
streams with the SpannerIO
connector , which offers an abstraction
over the Spanner API for querying change streams. With
this connector, you don't have to manage the change streams
partition lifecycle, which is necessary when you use the
Spanner API directly . The connector provides you
with a stream of data change records so that you are free to focus more
on application logic, and less on specific API details and dynamic
change stream partitioning. We recommend using the SpannerIO connector rather
than the Spanner API in most circumstances where you need to read
change stream data.
Dataflow templates are prebuilt Dataflow pipelines
that implement common use cases. See
Dataflow templates for an overview.
Dataflow pipeline
A Spanner change streams Dataflow pipeline is composed
of four main parts:
A Spanner database with a change stream
The SpannerIO connector
User-defined transforms and sinks
An Apache Beam sink I/O writer
Spanner change stream
For details on how to create a change stream, see Create
a change stream .
Apache Beam SpannerIO connector
This is the SpannerIO connector described in the earlier Dataflow section .
It is a source I/O connector that emits a PCollection of data change records
to later stages of the pipeline. The
event time
for each emitted data change record
will be the commit timestamp. Note that the records emitted are
unordered , and that the SpannerIO connector guarantees there will be no
late records .
When working with change streams, Dataflow uses checkpointing.
As a result, each worker might wait for up to the configured checkpoint interval
for buffering changes before sending the changes for further processing.
User-defined transforms
A user-defined transform allows a user to aggregate, transform or modify
processing data within a Dataflow pipeline. Common use
cases for this are the removal of personally identifiable information,
satisfying downstream data format requirements, and sorting. See the
official Apache Beam documentation for the programming guide on
transforms .
Apache Beam sink I/O writer
Apache Beam contains built-in I/O connectors
that can be used to write from a Dataflow pipeline into a data
sink like BigQuery. Most common data sinks are natively supported.
Dataflow templates
Dataflow
templates provide a method to
create Dataflow jobs based on prebuilt Docker images for common
use-cases using the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, or Rest API calls.
For Spanner change streams, we provide three
Dataflow flex templates:
Spanner change streams to BigQuery
Spanner change streams to Google Cloud Storage
Spanner change streams to Pub/Sub
The following restrictions apply when you use the Spanner
change streams to
Pub/Sub template:
Pub/Sub has a 10 MB message size limitation. For more information, see Pub/Sub quotas and limits .
The Spanner change streams to Pub/Sub template doesn't support handling of large messages because of Pub/Sub limitations.
Set IAM Permissions for Dataflow templates
Before creating a Dataflow job with the three flex templates
listed, ensure that you have the
required Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
for the following service accounts:
the
Dataflow service account
the
worker service account
If you don't have the required IAM permissions, then you must
specify a user-managed worker service account
to create the Dataflow job. For more information, see
Dataflow security and permissions .
When you try to run a job from a Dataflow flex template without
all the required permissions, then your job might fail with a
failed to read the result file error
or a
permission denied on resource error .
For more information, see
Troubleshoot Flex Templates .
Build a Dataflow pipeline
This section covers the connector's initial configuration, and provides
samples for common integrations with the Spanner change streams
feature.
To follow these steps, you need a Java development environment
for Dataflow. For more information, see
Create a Dataflow pipeline using Java .
Create a change stream
For details about how to create a change stream, see Create a change stream .
To continue with the next steps, you must have a Spanner database
with a change stream configured.
Grant fine-grained access control privileges
If you expect any fine-grained access control users to run the Dataflow job,
ensure that the users are granted access to a database
role that has the SELECT privilege on the change stream and the EXECUTE
privilege on the change stream's table-valued function. Also ensure that the
principal specifies the database role in the SpannerIO configuration or in
the Dataflow flex template.
For more information, see About fine-grained access control .
Add the SpannerIO connector as a dependency
The Apache Beam SpannerIO connector encapsulates the complexity of consuming the
change streams directly using the Cloud Spanner API, emitting a PCollection of
change stream data records to later stages of the pipeline.
These objects can be consumed in other stages of the user's
Dataflow pipeline. The change stream integration is part of the
SpannerIO connector. To be able to use the SpannerIO connector, the dependency
needs to be added to your pom.xml file:
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.beam</groupId>
<artifactId>beam-sdks-java-io-google-cloud-platform</artifactId>
<version>${beam-version}</version> <!-- available from version 2.38.0 -->
</dependency>
Create a metadata database
The connector needs to keep track of each partition when running the
Apache Beam pipeline. It keeps this metadata in a Spanner
table created by the connector during initialization. You specify the
database in which this table will be created when configuring the
connector.
As described in
Change streams best practices , we
recommend creating a new database for this purpose, rather than allowing the
connector to use your application's database to store its metadata table.
Important: If you expect fine-grained access control users to run Dataflow jobs, you
must create a separate database. For more information, see About fine-grained
access control .
The owner of a Dataflow job that uses the SpannerIO
connector needs to have the following IAM
permissions set with this metadata database:
spanner.databases.updateDdl
spanner.databases.beginReadOnlyTransaction
spanner.databases.beginOrRollbackReadWriteTransaction
spanner.databases.read
spanner.databases.select
spanner.databases.write
spanner.sessions.create
spanner.sessions.get
Configure the connector
The Spanner change streams connector can be configured as follows:
SpannerConfig spannerConfig = SpannerConfig
. create ()
. withProjectId ( "my-project-id" )
. withInstanceId ( "my-instance-id" )
. withDatabaseId ( "my-database-id" )
. withDatabaseRole ( "my-database-role" ); // Needed for fine-grained access control only
Timestamp startTime = Timestamp . now ();
Timestamp endTime = Timestamp . ofTimeSecondsAndNanos (
startTime . getSeconds () + ( 10 * 60 ),
startTime . getNanos ()
);
SpannerIO
. readChangeStream ()
. withSpannerConfig ( spannerConfig )
. withChangeStreamName ( "my-change-stream" )
. withMetadataInstance ( "my-meta-instance-id" )
. withMetadataDatabase ( "my-meta-database-id" )
. withMetadataTable ( "my-meta-table-name" )
. withRpcPriority ( RpcPriority . MEDIUM )
. withInclusiveStartAt ( startTime )
. withInclusiveEndAt ( endTime );
The following are descriptions of the readChangeStream() options:
Spanner Config (Required)
Used for configuring the project, instance and database where the change stream was created and should be queried from.
Also optionally specifies the database role to use when the IAM
principal who is running the Dataflow job is a fine-grained access control user.
The job assumes this database role for access to the change stream. For
more information, see About fine-grained access control .
Change stream name (Required)
This name uniquely identifies the change stream. The name here must be the same as the one used when creating it.
Metadata instance ID (Optional)
This is the instance to store the metadata used by the connector to control the consumption of the change stream API data.
Metadata database ID (Required)
This is the database to store the metadata used by the connector to control the consumption of the change stream API data.
Metadata table name (Optional)
This should only be used when updating an existing pipeline .
This is the pre-existing metadata table name to be used by the
connector. This is used by the connector to store the metadata to
control the consumption of the change stream API data. If this option is
omitted, Spanner creates a new table with a generated
name on connector initialization.
RPC priority (Optional)
The request
priority to be
used for the change stream queries. If this parameter is omitted, high
priority will be used.
InclusiveStartAt (Required)
Changes from the given timestamp are returned to the caller.
InclusiveEndAt (Optional)
Changes up to the given timestamp are returned to the caller. If this parameter
is omitted, changes will be emitted indefinitely.
Add transforms and sinks to process change data
With the previous steps complete, the configured SpannerIO connector is ready
to emit a PCollection of DataChangeRecord objects.
See Example transforms and sinks for several sample
pipeline configurations that process this streamed data in various ways.
Note that change stream records emitted by the SpannerIO connector are unordered.
This is because PCollections don't provide any ordering guarantees. If you need
an ordered stream, you must group and sort the records as transforms in your
pipelines: see Sample: Order by key . You can extend this sample
to sort the records based on any fields of the records, such as by transaction IDs.
Example transforms and sinks
You can define your own transforms and specify sinks to write the data into.
Apache Beam documentation provides a myriad of transforms
that can be applied, as well as ready to use I/O connectors
to write the data into external systems.
Sample: Order by key
This code sample emits data change records ordered by commit timestamp and grouped by primary keys using the Dataflow connector.
pipeline
. apply ( SpannerIO
. readChangeStream ()
. withSpannerConfig ( SpannerConfig
. create ()
. withProjectId ( "my-project-id" )
. withInstanceId ( "my-instance-id" )
. withDatabaseId ( "my-database-id" )
. withDatabaseRole ( "my-database-role" )) // Needed for fine-grained access control only
. withChangeStreamName ( "my-change-stream" )
. withMetadataInstance ( "my-metadata-instance-id" )
. withMetadataDatabase ( "my-metadata-database-id" )
. withInclusiveStartAt ( Timestamp . now ()))
. apply ( ParDo . of ( new BreakRecordByModFn ()))
. apply ( ParDo . of ( new KeyByIdFn ()))
. apply ( ParDo . of ( new BufferKeyUntilOutputTimestamp ()))
// Subsequent processing goes here
This code sample uses states and timers to buffer records for each key, and sets the expiration time of the timer to some user-configured time T in the future (defined in the BufferKeyUntilOutputTimestamp function). When the Dataflow watermark passes time T , this code flushes all records in the buffer with timestamp less than T , orders these records by commit timestamp, and outputs a key-value pair where:
The key is the input key, that is the primary key hashed to a bucket array of size 1000.
The value is the ordered data change records that were buffered for the key.
For each key, we have the following guarantees:
Timers are guaranteed to fire in order of expiration timestamp.
Downstream stages are guaranteed to receive the elements in the same order that they were produced.
For example, with a key of the value 100, the timer fires at T1 and T10 respectively, producing a bundle of data change records at each timestamp. Because the data change records outputted at T1 were produced before the data change records outputted at T10 , the data change records outputted at T1 are also guaranteed to be received by the next stage before the data change records outputted at T10 . This mechanism helps us guarantee strict commit timestamp ordering per primary key for downstream processing.
This process will repeat until the pipeline ends and all data change records have been processed (or it will repeat indefinitely if no end time is specified).
Note that this code sample uses states and timers, instead of windows, to perform ordering per key. The rationale is that windows aren't guaranteed
to be processed in order. This means that older windows can be processed later than more recent windows, which could result in out of order processing.
BreakRecordByModFn
Each data change record may contain several mods. Each mod represents an insert, update, or delete to a single primary key value. This function breaks each data change record into separate data change records, one per mod.
private static class BreakRecordByModFn extends DoFn<DataChangeRecord ,
DataChangeRecord > {
@ProcessElement
public void processElement (
@Element DataChangeRecord record , OutputReceiver<DataChangeRecord>
outputReceiver ) {
record . getMods (). stream ()
. map (
mod - >
new DataChangeRecord (
record . getPartitionToken (),
record . getCommitTimestamp (),
record . getServerTransactionId (),
record . isLastRecordInTransactionInPartition (),
record . getRecordSequence (),
record . getTableName (),
record . getRowType (),
Collections . singletonList ( mod ),
record . getModType (),
record . getValueCaptureType (),
record . getNumberOfRecordsInTransaction (),
record . getNumberOfPartitionsInTransaction (),
record . getTransactionTag (),
record . isSystemTransaction (),
record . getMetadata ()))
. forEach ( outputReceiver :: output );
}
}
KeyByIdFn
This function takes in a DataChangeRecord and outputs a DataChangeRecord keyed by the Spanner primary key hashed to an integer value.
private static class KeyByIdFn extends DoFn<DataChangeRecord , KV<String , DataChangeRecord >> {
// NUMBER_OF_BUCKETS should be configured by the user to match their key cardinality
// Here, we are choosing to hash the Spanner primary keys to a bucket index, in order to have a deterministic number
// of states and timers for performance purposes.
// Note that having too many buckets might have undesirable effects if it results in a low number of records per bucket
// On the other hand, having too few buckets might also be problematic, since many keys will be contained within them.
private static final int NUMBER_OF_BUCKETS = 1000 ;
@ProcessElement
public void processElement (
@Element DataChangeRecord record ,
OutputReceiver<KV<String , DataChangeRecord >> outputReceiver ) {
int hashCode = ( int ) record . getMods (). get ( 0 ). getKeysJson (). hashCode ();
// Hash the received keys into a bucket in order to have a
// deterministic number of buffers and timers.
String bucketIndex = String . valueOf ( hashCode % NUMBER_OF_BUCKETS );
outputReceiver . output ( KV . of ( bucketIndex , record ));
}
}
BufferKeyUntilOutputTimestamp
Timers and buffers are per-key. This function buffers each data change record until the watermark passes the timestamp at which we want to output the buffered data change records.
This code utilizes a looping timer to determine when to flush the buffer:
When it sees a data change record for a key for the first time, it sets the timer to fire at the data change record's commit timestamp + incrementIntervalSeconds (a user-configurable option).
When the timer fires, it adds all data change records in the buffer with timestamp less than the timer's expiration time to recordsToOutput . If the buffer has data change records whose timestamp is greater than or equal to the timer's expiration time, it adds those data change records back into the buffer instead of outputting them. It then sets the next timer to the current timer's expiration time plus incrementIntervalInSeconds .
If recordsToOutput is not empty, the function orders the data change records in recordsToOutput by commit timestamp and transaction ID and then outputs them.
private static class BufferKeyUntilOutputTimestamp extends
DoFn<KV<String , DataChangeRecord > , KV<String , Iterable<DataChangeRecord> >> {
private static final Logger LOG =
LoggerFactory . getLogger ( BufferKeyUntilOutputTimestamp . class );
private final long incrementIntervalInSeconds = 2 ;

}
}
Ordering transactions
This pipeline can be changed to order by transaction ID and commit timestamp. To do so, buffer records for each transaction ID / commit timestamp pair, instead of for each Spanner key. This requires modification of the code in KeyByIdFn .
Sample: Assemble transactions
This code sample reads data change records, assembles all data change records belonging to the same transaction into a single element, and outputs that element. Note that the transactions outputted by this sample code are not ordered by commit timestamp.
This code sample uses buffers to assemble transactions from data change records. Upon receiving a data change record belonging to a transaction for the first time, it reads the numberOfRecordsInTransaction field in the data change record, which describes the expected number of data change records belonging to that transaction. It buffers the data change records belonging to that transaction until the number of buffered records matches numberOfRecordsInTransaction , upon which it outputs the bundled data change records.
pipeline

// Subsequent processing goes here
KeyByTransactionIdFn
This function takes in a DataChangeRecord and outputs a DataChangeRecord keyed by the transaction ID.
private static class KeyByTransactionIdFn extends DoFn<DataChangeRecord , KV<String , DataChangeRecord >> {
@ProcessElement
public void processElement (
@Element DataChangeRecord record ,
OutputReceiver<KV<String , DataChangeRecord >> outputReceiver ) {
outputReceiver . output ( KV . of ( record . getServerTransactionId (), record ));
}
}
TransactionBoundaryFn
TransactionBoundaryFn buffers received key-value pairs of
{TransactionId, DataChangeRecord} from KeyByTransactionIdFn and
buffers them in groups based on TransactionId . When the number of
records buffered is equal to the number of records contained in the
entire transaction, this function sorts the DataChangeRecord objects
in the group by record sequence and outputs a key-value pair of
{CommitTimestamp, TransactionId} , Iterable<DataChangeRecord> .
Here, we are assuming that SortKey is a user-defined class that represents
a {CommitTimestamp, TransactionId} pair. For more information about the
SortKey , see the sample implementation .
private static class TransactionBoundaryFn extends DoFn<KV<String , DataChangeRecord > , KV<SortKey , Iterable<DataChangeRecord> >> {
@StateId ( "buffer" )
private final StateSpec<BagState<DataChangeRecord> > buffer = StateSpecs . bag ();

if ( count == record . getNumberOfRecordsInTransaction ()) {
final List<DataChangeRecord> sortedRecords =

Sample: Filter by transaction tag
When a transaction modifying user data is tagged, the corresponding tag and its type get stored as part of DataChangeRecord . These examples demonstrate how to filter change stream records based on user-defined transaction tags as well as system tags:
User-defined tag filtering for my-tx-tag :
pipeline
. apply ( SpannerIO
. readChangeStream ()
. withSpannerConfig ( SpannerConfig
. create ()
. withProjectId ( "my-project-id" )
. withInstanceId ( "my-instance-id" )
. withDatabaseId ( "my-database-id" )
. withDatabaseRole ( "my-database-role" )) // Needed for fine-grained access control only
. withChangeStreamName ( "my-change-stream" )
. withMetadataInstance ( "my-metadata-instance-id" )
. withMetadataDatabase ( "my-metadata-database-id" )
. withInclusiveStartAt ( Timestamp . now ()))
. apply ( Filter . by ( record - >
! record . isSystemTransaction ()
&& record . getTransactionTag (). equalsIgnoreCase ( "my-tx-tag" )))
// Subsequent processing goes here
System tag filtering/ TTL auditing:
pipeline
. apply ( SpannerIO
. readChangeStream ()
. withSpannerConfig ( SpannerConfig
. create ()
. withProjectId ( "my-project-id" )
. withInstanceId ( "my-instance-id" )
. withDatabaseId ( "my-database-id" )
. withDatabaseRole ( "my-database-role" )) // Needed for fine-grained access control only
. withChangeStreamName ( "my-change-stream" )
. withMetadataInstance ( "my-metadata-instance-id" )
. withMetadataDatabase ( "my-metadata-database-id" )
. withInclusiveStartAt ( Timestamp . now ()))
. apply ( Filter . by ( record - >
record . isSystemTransaction ()
&& record . getTransactionTag (). equals ( "RowDeletionPolicy" )))
// Subsequent processing goes here
Sample: Fetch full row
This example works with a Spanner table named Singer that has the following definition:
CREATE TABLE Singers (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
FirstName STRING ( 1024 ),
LastName STRING ( 1024 )
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId );
Under the default OLD_AND_NEW_VALUES value capture mode of change streams,
when there is an update to a Spanner row, the data change
record received will contain only the columns that were changed. Tracked but
unchanged columns will not be included in the record. The primary key of the
mod can be used to do a Spanner snapshot read at the commit
timestamp of the data change record to fetch the unchanged columns or even
retrieve the full row.
Note that the database retention policy might need to be changed to a value
greater or equal to the change stream retention policy in order for the snapshot
read to succeed.
Also note that using the NEW_ROW value capture type is the recommended and
more efficient way to do this, since it returns all tracked columns of the row
by default and does not require an extra snapshot read into Spanner.
SpannerConfig spannerConfig = SpannerConfig
. create ()
. withProjectId ( "my-project-id" )
. withInstanceId ( "my-instance-id" )
. withDatabaseId ( "my-database-id" )
. withDatabaseRole ( "my-database-role" ); // Needed for fine-grained access control only
pipeline
. apply ( SpannerIO

// Assume we have a change stream "my-change-stream" that watches Singers table.
. withChangeStreamName ( "my-change-stream" )

. withMetadataDatabase ( "my-metadata-database-id" )
. withInclusiveStartAt ( Timestamp . now ()))
. apply ( ParDo . of ( new ToFullRowJsonFn ( spannerConfig )))
// Subsequent processing goes here
ToFullRowJsonFn
This transformation will perform a stale read at the commit timestamp of each
record received, and map the full row to JSON.
public class ToFullRowJsonFn extends DoFn<DataChangeRecord , String > {
// Since each instance of this DoFn will create its own session pool and will
// perform calls to Spanner sequentially, we keep the number of sessions in
// the pool small. This way, we avoid wasting resources.

This code creates a Spanner database client to perform the full
row fetch, and configures the session pool to have just a few sessions,
performing reads in one instance of the ToFullReowJsonFn sequentially.
Dataflow makes sure to spawn many instances of this function,
each with its own client pool.
Note: We recommended adding a re-shuffle stage after a stage which reads the
change stream. This re-distributes data into multiple worker threads, and
increases parallelism.
Sample: Spanner to Pub/Sub
In this scenario, the caller streams records to Pub/Sub as
fast as possible, without any grouping or aggregation. This is a good
fit for triggering downstream processing, as as streaming all new rows
inserted into a Spanner table to
Pub/Sub for further
processing.

Note that the Pub/Sub sink can be configured to assure exactly-once semantics.
Sample: Spanner to Cloud Storage
In this scenario, the caller groups all the records within a given window and saves the group in separate Cloud Storage files. This is a good fit for analytics and point-in-time archival, which is independent from Spanner's retention period.

Note that the Cloud Storage sink provides at-least-once semantics by default. With extra processing , it can be modified to have exactly-once semantics.
We also provide a Dataflow template for this use case: see Connect change streams to Cloud Storage .
Sample: Spanner to BigQuery (ledger table)
Here, the caller streams change records into BigQuery. Each data change record is reflected as one row in BigQuery. This is a good fit for analytics. This code uses the functions defined earlier, in the Fetch full row section, to retrieve the full row of the record and write it into BigQuery.

. set ( "FirstName" , jsonNode . get ( "FirstName" ). asText ())

We also provide a Dataflow template for this use case; see Connect change streams to BigQuery .
Monitor a pipeline
There are two classes of metrics available to monitor a change stream Dataflow pipeline.
Standard Dataflow metrics
Dataflow provides several metrics to make sure your job is healthy, such as data freshness, system lag, job throughput, worker CPU utilization and more. You can find more information in Using Monitoring for Dataflow pipelines .
For change streams pipelines, there are two main metrics that should be taken into account: the system latency and the data freshness .
The system latency will tell you the current maximum duration of time (in seconds) for which an item of data is processed or awaiting processing.
The data freshness will show you the amount of time between now (real time) and the output watermark. The output watermark of time T indicates that all elements with an event time (strictly) before T have been processed for computation. In other words, the data freshness measures how up to date the pipeline is, in regards to processing the events it has received.
If the pipeline is under-resourced, you can see that effect in these two metrics. The system latency will increase, because items need to wait for longer before they are processed. The data freshness will also increase, because the pipeline won't be able to keep up with the amount of data received.
Custom change stream metrics
These metrics are exposed in Cloud Monitoring and include:
Bucketed (histogram) latency between a record being committed in Spanner to it being emitted into a PCollection by the connector. This metric can be used to see any performance (latency) issues with the pipeline.
Total number of data records read. This is an overall indication of the number of records emitted by the connector. This number should be ever-increasing, mirroring the trend of writes in the underlying Spanner database.
Number of partitions that are being read. There should always be partitions being read. If this number is zero, it indicates that an error has occurred in the pipeline.
Total number of queries issued during the execution of the connector. This is an overall indication of change stream queries made to the Spanner instance throughout the execution of the pipeline. This can be used to get an estimate of the load from the connector to the Spanner database.
Update an existing pipeline
It is possible to update a running pipeline that uses the SpannerIO
connector to process change streams if the job compatibility
checks pass. To do
this, you have to explicitly set the metadata table name parameter of
the new job when updating it. Use the value of the metadataTable
pipeline option from the job you are updating.
If you are using a Google-provided Dataflow template, set the
table name using the parameter spannerMetadataTableName . You can also modify
your existing job to explicitly use the metadata table with the method
withMetadataTable( your-metadata-table-name ) in
the connector configuration. After that is done, you can follow the
instructions in Launching your replacement
job from the
Dataflow documentation to update a running job.
Best practices for change streams and Dataflow
The following are some best practices for building change streams connections
by using Dataflow.
Use a separate metadata database
We recommend creating a separate database for the SpannerIO connector to use for
metadata storage, rather than configuring it to use your application database.
For more information, see
Consider a separate metadata database .
Size your cluster
A rule of thumb for an initial number of workers in a
Spanner change streams job is one worker per 1,000 writes per
second. Note that this estimate can vary depending on
several factors, such as the size of each transaction, how many change stream
records are produced from a single transaction and other transformations,
aggregations, or sinks that are being used in the pipeline.
After initial resourcing, it is important to keep track of the metrics mentioned
in Monitor a pipeline ,
to ensure the pipeline is healthy. We recommend experimenting with an initial
worker pool size and monitor how your
pipeline deals with the load, increasing the number of nodes if necessary. The
CPU utilization is a key metric to check if the load is proper and more nodes
are needed.
Known limitations
There are a few known limitations when using Spanner change streams
with Dataflow:
Autoscaling
Autoscaling support for any pipelines that include SpannerIO.readChangeStream
requires Apache Beam 2.39.0 or higher.
If you use an Apache Beam version prior to 2.39.0 , pipelines that include
SpannerIO.readChangeStream need to explicitly specify the autoscaling
algorithm as NONE , as described in Horizontal autoscaling .
To
manually scale a Dataflow pipeline instead of using autoscaling, see
Manually scaling a streaming pipeline .
Runner V2
The Spanner change streams connector requires
Dataflow Runner V2 .
This has to be manually specified during the execution or an error will be
thrown. You are able to specify Runner V2 by configuring your job with
--experiments=use_unified_worker,use_runner_v2 .
Snapshot
The Spanner change streams connector does not support
Dataflow Snapshots .
Draining
The Spanner change streams connector does not support
draining a job .
It is only possible to cancel an existing job.
You can also update an existing pipeline
without needing to stop it.
OpenCensus
To use
OpenCensus
to monitor your pipeline, specify version
0.28.3 or later.
NullPointerException on pipeline start
A bug in Apache Beam version 2.38.0 can cause a NullPointerException when starting the pipeline under certain conditions. This would prevent your job from starting, and display this error message instead:
java . lang . NullPointerException : null value in entry : Cloud Storage_PROJECT_ID = null
To address this issue, either use Apache Beam version 2.39.0 or later, or
manually specify the version of beam-sdks-java-core as 2.37.0 :
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.beam</groupId>
<artifactId>beam-sdks-java-core</artifactId>
<version>2.37.0</version>
</dependency>
