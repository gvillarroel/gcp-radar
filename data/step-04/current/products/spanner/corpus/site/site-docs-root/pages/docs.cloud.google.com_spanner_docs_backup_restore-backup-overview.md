Restore overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can restore a backup of a Spanner database into a new database. The
restored database will have all the data and schema from the original database
at the version_time of the backup, including all database options that are set
with the ALTER DATABASE SET OPTIONS
command. However, the following aren't included in the restored database:
Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions (except for those inherited from the
instance containing the restored database). You must apply appropriate
IAM permissions after the restore completes.
Internal data of any change streams.
Time to live (TTL) defined by a row deletion policy. You must reconfigure
these policies after the restore completes. For more information, see
Backups and TTL .
Split points you created when pre-splitting a database. For more information,
see Pre-splitting overview .
If you need to restore from a backup in a different region or project for
compliance or business continuity reasons, you can
copy the backup to an
instance in a separate region or project, then restore from the copied backup.
You can use restore from a backup in the following ways:
In the Google Cloud console
Using the Google Cloud CLI
Using the client libraries
Using the REST or
RPC
APIs
How database restoration from a backup works
When you restore a Spanner database, you must specify a source
backup and a new target database. You cannot restore to an existing database.
The newly restored database must be in the same project as the backup and be in
an instance with the same
instance configuration and same (or
higher-tier) Spanner edition as
the backup. For example, if a backup is in an instance configured us-west3 and
uses the Enterprise edition, it can be restored to any instance in the
project that is also configured us-west3 and uses the
Enterprise edition. If you restore a backup in an
Enterprise edition instance into a Standard edition
instance, the restore might fail if the database uses
Enterprise edition features. The compute capacity of the
instances doesn't need to be the same.
The restore process is designed for high-availability. You can restore the
database provided that the majority quorum of the regions and zones in the
target instance is available.
To restore a CMEK-enabled backup, both the key and key version must be available
to Spanner. The restored database, by default, uses the same
encryption configurations
as the backup. You can override this behavior by specifying a different
encryption configuration when restoring the database. For more information, see
restore from a CMEK-enabled backup .
You can't restore a backup that uses higher-tier edition features to a
lower-tier edition . For example, if your
instance uses geo-partitioning , then you can't
restore it to the Enterprise edition or Standard edition.
Note: Before restoring a database, make sure your instance is properly
provisioned with enough storage and compute capacity to handle the additional
storage and traffic associated with the restored database. If the target
instance is not properly provisioned, restoring a database could adversely
affect the performance of existing databases in the instance.
Restore a backup to a different region or project
If you need to restore the backup to a different region or project, first,
copy the backup to the
chosen region or project. Copied backups are restorable as soon as the copy
finishes. You can restore the backup to the destination instance if it uses the
same or a higher-tier edition as the source backup instance. Alternatively, you
can restore it to any instance with the same instance configuration and an
edition that is the same or higher-tier than the source instance. Before
restoring, make sure that the destination instance has enough nodes or
processing units provisioned to support the database size according to the 10 TB
per node storage limit. For example, you need at least 2 nodes to restore a
20 TB backup. If you have copied the backup to a different project, and if you
want to restore it there, make sure that your destination project has enough
node quotas required for the restore. Restoring a copied backup works the same
way as a normal restore.
Restoration states
A restored database transitions through three states ,
tracked by two long-running operations .
CREATING : Spanner begins restoring by creating a new
database and mounting files from the backup. During this initial CREATING
state, the restored database is not yet ready for use. This state typically
completes within one hour. Once the CREATING state is complete, your
database is ready to use.
To track the progress of this state, you can query the long-running restore
operation that
Spanner makes available during this process. It returns a
RestoreDatabaseMetadata object.
Note the following caveats regarding the CREATING state:
If you are restoring to a different instance, the restore operation
belongs to the instance containing the restored database, not the instance
containing the backup.
Spanner won't allow you to delete the backup while it is
being restored. You can delete it after the restore completes and the
database enters the READY state.
An instance can have at most ten databases in the CREATING state due to
restoration from backups. You won't be able to restore another backup
to the instance until one of the ten restored databases transitions to
the READY_OPTIMIZING or READY state.
READY_OPTIMIZING : After Spanner mounts the backup, it starts
to copy the backup data into the new database while optimizing its stored
size. Your database is ready for use during this process. This phase of the
restore usually takes a few hours to complete for databases less than 100TB
in size.
While you can use your database as usual during READY_OPTIMIZING , the
following caveats apply:
Read latencies might be slightly higher than usual.
Storage metrics display the size of
the new database, not the backup. Therefore, with the data transfer still
in progress, Spanner storage metrics might show results
that don't reflect the total size of all your data.
As with the CREATING state, Spanner won't allow you to
delete the mounted backup.
Spanner makes another long-running restore operation
available during this state, this time returning a OptimizeRestoredDatabaseMetadata
metadata object.
READY : Once the copy-and-optimize operation completes, the database
transitions to the READY state. The database is fully restored, and no
longer references or requires the backup.
Access control (IAM)
The role spanner.restoreAdmin gives you permission to restore from a backup.
For more information, see Access control with IAM .
The following roles also have access to Spanner restore operations:
spanner.admin : has full access to restore. This role has
complete access to all Spanner resources.
owner : has full access to restore.
editor : has full access to restore.
viewer : has access to view restore and restore operations. This role
can't create, update, delete, or copy a backup.
Pricing
There is no charge for restoring from a backup.
