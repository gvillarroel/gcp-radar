Best practices for using Spanner as a gaming database
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes best practices for using Spanner as the
primary backend database for game state storage. You can use
Spanner
in place of common databases to store player authentication data and inventory
data. This document is intended for game backend engineers working on long-term
state storage, and game infrastructure operators and admins who support those
systems and are interested in hosting their backend database on
Google Cloud.
Multiplayer and online games have evolved to require increasingly complex
database structures for tracking player entitlements, state, and inventory data.
Growing player bases and increasing game complexity have led to database
solutions that are a challenge to scale and manage, frequently requiring the
use of
sharding
or
clustering .
Tracking valuable in-game items or critical player progress typically requires
transactions and is challenging to work around in many types of distributed
databases.
Spanner is the first scalable, enterprise-grade, globally
distributed, and strongly consistent database service built for the cloud to
combine the benefits of relational database structure with non-relational
horizontal scale. Many game companies have found it to be well-suited to replace
both game state and authentication databases in production-scale systems. You
can scale for additional performance or storage by using the
Google Cloud console to add nodes. Spanner can
transparently handle global replication with strong consistency, eliminating
your need to manage regional replicas.
This best practices document discusses the following:

with Spanner.
Terminology
Entitlements
Games, expansions, or in-app purchases belonging to a player.
Personally identifiable information (PII)
In games, information that typically includes email address and payment
account information, such as a credit card number and billing address. In
some markets, this information might include a national ID number.
Game database (game DB)
A database that holds player progress and inventory for a game.
Authentication database (auth DB)
A database that includes player entitlements and the PII that the players
use when making a purchase. The auth DB is also known as the account DB
or player DB. This database is sometimes combined with the game DB, but
they are frequently separated in studios or publishers that have multiple
titles.
Transaction
A database transaction —a
set of write operations that have an all-or-nothing effect.
Either the transaction succeeds and all updates take effect, or the
database is returned to a state that doesn't include any of the updates of
the transaction. In games, database transactions are most critical when
processing payments, and when assigning the ownership of valuable in-game
inventory or currency.
Relational database management system (RDBMS)
A database system based on tables and rows that reference one another.
SQL Server, MySQL, and (less commonly) Oracle® are examples of relational
databases used in games. These are frequently used because they can provide
familiar methodologies and
strong guarantees around transactions .
NoSQL database (NoSQL DB)
Databases that are not structured relationally. These databases are
becoming more popular in games because they have a lot of flexibility
when the data model changes. NoSQL databases include MongoDB and Cassandra.
Primary key
Usually the column that contains the unique ID for inventory items, player
accounts, and purchase transactions.
Instance
A single database. For example, a cluster runs multiple copies of the
database software, but appears as a single instance to the game backend.
Node
For the purposes of this document, a single machine running a copy of the
database software.
Replica
A second copy of a database. Replicas are frequently used for data recovery
and high availability, or to help increase read throughput.
Cluster
Multiple copies of the software running on many machines that together
appear as a single instance to the game backend. Clustering is used for
scalability and availability.
Shard
An instance of a database. Many game studios run multiple
homogeneous database instances, each of which holds a subset of the game
data. Each of these instances is commonly referred to as a shard .
Sharding is typically done for performance or scalability, sacrificing
management efficiency while increasing app complexity.
Sharding in Spanner is implemented using splits .
Split
Spanner divides your data into chunks called splits , where individual
splits can move independently from each other and get assigned to
different servers. A split
is defined as a range of rows in a top-level (in other words,
non-interleaved) table, where the rows are ordered by primary key. The
start and end keys of this range are called "split boundaries".
Spanner automatically adds and removes split boundaries,
which changes the number of splits in the database. Spanner
splits data based on load: it adds split boundaries automatically when it
detects high read or write load spread among many keys in a split.
Hotspot
When a single split in a distributed database like Spanner
contains records receiving a large portion of all the queries going to the
database. This scenario is undesirable because it degrades performance.
Using Spanner for games
In most cases where you are considering an RDBMS for your game,
Spanner is an appropriate choice because it can effectively
replace either the game DB, the auth DB, or in many cases, both.
Game DBs
Spanner can operate as a single worldwide transactional
authority, which makes it an outstanding fit for game inventory systems. Any
in-game currency or item that can be traded, sold, gifted, or otherwise
transferred from one player to another presents a challenge in large-scale game
backends. Often, the popularity of a game can outpace a traditional database's
ability to handle everything in a single-node database. Depending on the type of
game, the database can struggle with the number of operations required to handle
the player load as well as the amount of stored data. This often leads game
developers to shard their database for additional performance, or to store
ever-growing tables. This type of solution leads to operational complexity and
high maintenance overhead.
To help mitigate this complexity, one common strategy is to run completely
separate game regions with no way to move data between them. In this case, items
and currency cannot be traded between players in different game regions, because
inventories in each region are segregated into separate databases. However, this
setup sacrifices the preferred player experience, in favor of developer and
operational simplicity.
On the other hand, you can allow cross-region trades in a geographically
sharded database, but often at a high complexity cost. This setup requires that
transactions span multiple database instances, leading to complex, error-prone
application-side logic. Trying to get transaction locks on multiple databases
can have significant performance impacts. In addition, not being able to rely on
atomic transactions
can lead to player exploits such as in-game currency or item duplication, which
harm the game's ecosystem and community.
Spanner can simplify your approach to inventory and currency
transactions. Even when using Spanner to hold all of your game
data worldwide, it offers read-write transactions with even
stronger than conventional atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID)
properties. With the scalability of Spanner, it means that data
doesn't need to be sharded into separate database instances when more
performance or storage is needed; instead, you can add more nodes.
Additionally, the high availability and data resiliency for which games often
cluster their databases are handled transparently by Spanner,
requiring no additional setup or management.
Auth DBs
Auth DBs can also be well served by Spanner, especially if you
want to standardize on a single RDBMS at your studio or publisher level.
Although auth DBs for games often don't require the scale of
Spanner, the transactional
guarantees and high data availability
can make it compelling. Data replication in Spanner is
transparent, synchronous, and built-in. Spanner has
configurations offering either
99.99% ("four nines") or 99.999% ("five nines") of availability ,
with "five nines" corresponding to less than five and a half minutes of
unavailability in a year. This type of availability makes it a good choice for
the critical authentication path required at the beginning of every player
session.
Best practices
This section provides recommendations for how to use Spanner in
game design. It's important to model your game data to benefit from
the unique features offered by Spanner. Although you can access
Spanner by using relational database semantics, some schema
design points can help you increase your performance. The Spanner
documentation has
detailed schema design recommendations
that you can review, but the following sections are some best practices for game
DBs.
The practices in this document are based on experiences from
customer usage and case studies .
Use UUIDs as player and character IDs
The player table typically has one row for each player and their in-game
currency, progress, or other data that doesn't map easily to discrete inventory
table rows. If your game allows players to have separate saved progress for
multiple characters, like many large persistent massively multiplayer games,
then this table typically contains a row for each character instead. The pattern
is otherwise the same.
We recommend using a globally unique character or player identifier (character
ID) as the primary key of the character table. We also recommend using the
Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) v4 ,
because it spreads the player data across DB nodes and can help you get
increased performance out of Spanner.
Use interleaving for inventory tables
The inventory table often holds in-game items, such as character equipment,
cards, or units. Typically, a single player has many items in their inventory.
Each item is represented by a single row in the table.
Similar to other relational databases, an inventory table in
Spanner has a primary key that is a globally unique identifier
for the item, as illustrated in the following table.
itemID

playerID

In the example inventory table, itemID and playerID are truncated for
readability. An actual inventory table would also contain many other columns
that aren't included in the example.
A typical approach in an RDBMS for tracking item ownership is to use a column
as a foreign key that holds the current owner's player ID. This column is the
primary key of a separate database table. In Spanner, you can use
interleaving ,
which stores the inventory rows near the associated player table row for better
performance. When using interleaved tables, keep the following in mind:
You cannot generate an object without an owner. You can avoid ownerless
objects in the game design provided the limitation is known ahead of time.
Design indexing to avoid hotspots
Many game developers implement indexes on many of the inventory fields to
optimize certain queries. In Spanner,
creating or updating a row with data in that index generates additional write
load proportional to the number of indexed columns. You can improve
Spanner performance by eliminating indexes that aren't used
frequently, or by
implementing these indexes in other ways that don't impact database performance .
In the following example, there is a table for long-term player high-score
records:
CREATE TABLE Ranking (
PlayerID STRING ( 36 ) NOT NULL ,
GameMode INT64 NOT NULL ,
Score INT64 NOT NULL
) PRIMARY KEY ( PlayerID , GameMode )
This table contains the player ID (UUIDv4), a number representing a
game mode, stage, or season, and the player's score.
Note: Storing player scores in the database as shown in this example is not a
suitable approach for maintaining a frequently updated live leaderboard. For
that use case, we recommend an in-memory implementation using Redis, and
periodically saving high scores to long-term storage as necessary.
In order to speed up queries that filter for the game mode, consider the
following index:
CREATE INDEX idx_score_ranking ON Ranking (
GameMode ,
Score DESC
)
If everyone plays the same game mode called 1 , this index creates a hotspot
where GameMode=1 . If you want to get a ranking for this game mode, the index
only scans the rows containing GameMode=1 , returning the ranking quickly.
If you change the order of the previous index, you can solve this hotspot
problem:
CREATE INDEX idx_score_ranking ON Ranking (
Score DESC ,
GameMode
)
This index won't create a significant hotspot from players competing in the
same game mode, provided their scores are distributed across the possible
range. However, getting scores won't be as fast as with the previous index
because the query scans all scores from all modes in order to determine if
GameMode=1 .
As a result, the reordered index solves the previous hotspot on game mode but
still has room for improvement, as illustrated in the following design.
CREATE TABLE GameMode1Ranking (
PlayerID STRING ( 36 ) NOT NULL ,
Score INT64 NOT NULL
) PRIMARY KEY ( PlayerID )
CREATE INDEX idx_score_ranking ON Ranking (
Score DESC
)
We recommend moving the game mode out of the table schema, and use one table
per mode, if possible. By using this method, when you retrieve the scores for a
mode, you only query a table with scores for that mode in it. This table can be
indexed by score for fast retrieval of score ranges without significant danger
of hotspots (provided the scores are well distributed). As of the writing of
this document,
the maximum number of tables per database
in Spanner is 2560, which is more than enough for most games.
Separate databases per tenant
Unlike other workloads, where we
recommend designing for multi-tenancy in Spanner
by using different primary key values, for gaming data, we recommend the more
conventional approach of separate databases per tenant .
Schema changes are common with the release of new game features in live service
games, and isolation of tenants at a database level can simplify schema updates.
This strategy can also optimize the time it takes to backup or restore a
tenant's data, because these operations are performed on an entire database at
once.
Avoid incremental schema updates
Unlike some conventional relational databases, Spanner remains
operational during schema updates. All queries against the old schema are
returned (although they might return less quickly than usual), and queries
against the new schema are returned as they become available. You can design
your update process to keep your game running during schema updates when running on
Spanner, provided you keep the preceding constraints in mind.
However, if you request another schema change while there is one that is being
processed, the new update is queued and won't take place until all previous
schema updates have completed. You can avoid this situation by planning larger
schema updates, instead of issuing many incremental schema updates in a short
period. For more information about schema updates, including how to perform a
schema update that requires data validation ,
see
Spanner schema update documentation
Consider database access and size
When you develop your game server and platform services to use
Spanner, consider how your game accesses the database and how to
size the database to avoid unnecessary costs.
Use built-in drivers and libraries
When you develop against Spanner, consider how your code
interfaces with the database.
Spanner offers built-in client libraries
for many popular languages, which are typically feature-rich and performant.
JDBC drivers are also available, which support
data manipulation language (DML) and data definition language (DDL) statements.
In cases where Spanner is
used in new development, we recommend using the Cloud Client Libraries for
Spanner. Although typical game engine integrations don't have
much flexibility in language selection, for platform services accessing
Spanner, there are cases of gaming customers using
Java or Go. For high throughput applications, select a library where you can use
the same Spanner client for multiple sequential requests.
Size the database to testing and production needs
During development, a single-node Spanner instance is likely
sufficient for most activities, including functional testing.
Warning: We don't recommend a single-node instance in a production environment
with live players. Before you put live traffic in a production environment, see
the section about
sizing considerations for production .
Evaluate Spanner needs for production
When you move from development to testing, and then into production, it's
important that you reevaluate your Spanner needs to insure your
game can handle live player traffic.
Before you move to production, load tests are crucial to verify that your
backend can handle the load during production. We recommend running load tests
with double the load you expect in production in order to be prepared for spikes
in usage and cases where your game is more popular than anticipated.
Run load tests using real data
Running a load test with
synthetic data
isn't sufficient. You should also run load tests using data and access patterns
as close as possible to what is expected in production. Synthetic data might not
detect potential hotspots in
your Spanner schema design. Nothing is better than running a beta
test (open or closed) with real players to verify how Spanner
behaves with real data.
The following diagram is an example player table schema from a game studio that
illustrates the importance of using beta tests to load test.
The studio prepared this data based on trends from a previous game that they had
operated for a couple of years. The company expected the schema to represent the
data in this new game well.
Each player record has some numerical attributes associated with it that
tracks the player's progress in the game (such as rank, and play time). For the
example attribute used in the preceding table, new players are given a starting
value of 50, and this value then changes to a value between 1 and 100 as the
player advances.
The studio wants to index this attribute in order to speed up important queries
during gameplay.
Based on this data, the studio created the following
Spanner table, with a primary key using the PlayerID and a
secondary index on Attribute .
CREATE TABLE Player (
PlayerID STRING ( 36 ) NOT NULL ,
Attribute INT64 NOT NULL
) PRIMARY KEY ( PlayerID )
CREATE INDEX idx_attribute ON Player ( Attribute )
And the index was queried to find up to ten players with Attribute=23 ,
like this:
SELECT PlayerID
FROM Player @ { force_index = idx_attribute }
WHERE Attribute = 23
LIMIT 10
According to the documentation on optimizing schema design , Spanner
stores index data in the same way as tables, with one row per index entry.
In load tests, this model does an acceptable job of distributing the secondary
index read and write load across multiple Spanner splits, as
illustrated in the following diagram:
Although the synthetic data used in the load test is similar to the eventual steady
state of the game where Attribute values are well distributed, the game
design dictates that all players start with Attribute=50 . Because each new
player starts with Attribute=50 , when new players join they are inserted in
the same part of the idx_attribute secondary index. This means updates are
routed to the same Spanner split, causing a hotspot during the
game's launch window. This is an inefficient use of Spanner.
In the following diagram, adding an IndexPartition column to the schema after the launch
resolves the hotspot issue, and players are evenly distributed across the
available Spanner splits. The updated command for creating the
table and index looks like this:
CREATE TABLE Player (
PlayerID STRING ( 36 ) NOT NULL ,
IndexPartition INT64 NOT NULL
Attribute INT64 NOT NULL
) PRIMARY KEY ( PlayerID )
CREATE INDEX idx_attribute ON Player ( IndexPartition , Attribute )
The IndexPartition value needs to have a limited range for efficient querying,
but it should also have range that is at least double the number of splits for
efficient distribution.
In this case, the studio manually assigned every player an IndexPartition
between 1 and 6 in the game application.
Alternative methods could be to assign a random number to each player, or
assigning a value derived from a hash on the PlayerID value.
See What DBAs need to know about Spanner, part 1: Keys and indexes
for more application-level sharding strategies.
Updating the previous query to use this improved index looks like the following:
SELECT PlayerID
FROM Player @ { force_index = idx_attribute }
WHERE IndexPartition BETWEEN 1 and 6
AND Attribute = 23
LIMIT 10
Because no beta test was run, the studio didn't realize they were testing by
using data with incorrect assumptions. Although synthetic load tests are a good
way to validate how many
queries per second (QPS)
your instance can handle, a beta test with real players is necessary to validate
your schema and prepare a successful launch.
Size the production environment to anticipate peak demand
Major games often experience the peak of their traffic at launch. Building up a
scalable backend applies not only to platform services and dedicated game
servers but to databases as well. Using Google Cloud solutions such as
App Engine ,
you can build frontend API services that can scale up quickly. Even though
Spanner offers the flexibility to add and remove nodes online, it
isn't an autoscaling database. You need to provision enough nodes to handle the
traffic spike at launch.
Based on the data you gathered during load testing or from any public beta
testing, you can estimate the number of nodes required to handle requests at
launch. It's a good practice to add a few nodes as buffer in case you get more
players than expected. You should always size the database based on not
exceeding an average CPU usage of 65%.
Warm up the database before game launch
Before you launch your game, we recommend that you warm up your database to take advantage
of the Spanner parallelization features. For more information, see Warming up the database before application launch .
Monitor and understand performance
Any production database requires comprehensive monitoring and performance
metrics. Spanner comes with built-in metrics in
Cloud Monitoring .
Where possible, we recommend incorporating the provided gRPC libraries into
your game backend process because these libraries include
OpenCensus tracing .
OpenCensus tracing lets you see query traces in Cloud Trace as well as
other supported open source tracing tools.
In Monitoring, you can see details on your
Spanner usage, including data storage and CPU usage. For most
cases, we recommend that you base your Spanner scaling decisions
on this CPU usage metric or observed latency. For more information about
suggested CPU usage for optimized performance, see
Best practices .
Spanner offers
query execution plans .
You can review these plans in the Google Cloud console,
and contact support if you need help understanding your query performance.
When you're evaluating performance, keep short cycle testing to a minimum
because Spanner transparently splits your data behind the scenes
to optimize performance based on your data access patterns. You should evaluate
performance by using sustained, realistic query loads.
When removing data, delete rows instead of re-creating tables
When you're working with Spanner, newly created tables haven't
yet had an opportunity to undergo load-based or size-based splitting to improve
performance. When you delete data by dropping a table and then recreating it,
Spanner needs data, queries, and time to determine the correct
splits for your table. If you are planning to repopulate a table with the same
kind of data (for example, when running consecutive performance tests), you can
instead run a DELETE query on the rows containing data you no longer need. For
the same reason, schema updates should use the provided Cloud Spanner API, and
should avoid a manual strategy, such as creating a new table and copying the
data from another table or a backup file.
Select a data locality to meet compliance requirements
Many games must comply with
data locality laws such as GDPR
when played worldwide. To help support your GDPR needs, see the
Google Cloud and the GDPR whitepaper
and select the correct
Spanner regional configuration .
