Concurrency control
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Spanner transactions offer two modes of concurrency control:
pessimistic and optimistic . The choice of concurrency control mode affects
how transactions handle simultaneous reads and writes, influencing performance,
latency, and transaction abort rates. Choose the mode that best suits your
application's performance and consistency requirements.
The default behavior depends on the isolation level
your transaction uses:
Serializable isolation uses
pessimistic concurrency control by default.
Repeatable read isolation ,
uses optimistic concurrency control by default.
Pessimistic concurrency control
Note: Spanner doesn't support using pessimistic concurrency
control with repeatable read isolation.
By default, Spanner uses pessimistic concurrency with
serializable isolation . This mode
assumes that concurrent transactions might contend for the same data.
It acquires locks
proactively on data as it is read or written within a transaction. It also
verifies that locks acquired earlier in the transaction remain held in later
statements. When Spanner detects a lock conflict, it uses the
wound-wait algorithm to resolve the conflict.
In pessimistic concurrency, transactions acquire locks on data during both the
execution and commit phases of the transaction.
For reads: When a transaction reads data, it acquires a
shared read ( ReaderShared ) lock
during the execution phase. These locks are held until the transaction
commits.
For DML and writes:
During execution, for data modified by DML or writes, the transaction
might acquire read locks on row-existence.
At commit time, the transaction attempts to acquire write or
exclusive locks for the written data. Write locks block concurrent
reads, but might not block concurrent writes, especially when they
both use write locks. This means multiple transactions can proceed to
commit, and write-write conflicts are resolved at commit time using
the wound-wait algorithm. All locks are held until the transaction
commits.
Benefits of pessimistic concurrency with serializable isolation
The main benefit of using pessimistic concurrency with serializable isolation
is that, in highly contentious workloads, it helps transactions make progress.
Spanner prioritizes older transactions over newer ones during
conflicts, ensuring that transactions eventually complete while reducing the
amount of repeatedly aborting transactions.
Risks of pessimistic concurrency
Pessimistic concurrency with serializable isolation presents the following risks:
Long-running reads might block latency-sensitive writes.
Transactions that involve user interaction before completion might cause locks
to be held for a long time, potentially blocking other operations.
Use cases for pessimistic concurrency
Pessimistic concurrency is suitable for workloads with high read-write and
write-write contention. It is also appropriate when transaction aborts and
retries are costly. Use this default mode unless your workload has excessive
long lock delays, or is significantly impacted by lock conflicts.
Optimistic concurrency control
Spanner also provides optimistic concurrency control. When you
use repeatable read isolation, the default mode is optimistic concurrency
control. You can also configure serializable isolation to use optimistic
concurrency control.
Optimistic concurrency control assumes that conflicts are rare. Reads and
queries even within a read-write transaction proceed without acquiring locks.
With Spanner's default serializable isolation, reads are
validated at commit time. This ensures that no other concurrently committed
transaction modified the data previously read by the transaction. If you use
repeatable read isolation ,
reads with either a FOR UPDATE or lock_scanned_ranges=exclusive hint are
validated at commit time. If Spanner detects a conflict, it
aborts the transaction.
How optimistic concurrency works
Optimistic concurrency changes how Spanner executes reads,
queries, and commits transactions. It performs lock-free execution during the
read phase and validates consistency at commit.
For reads and queries
Reads and queries are lock-free. All reads and queries within an optimistic
transaction execute at a single, snapshot timestamp. Spanner
chooses this timestamp when the first read or query executes. This ensures that
all subsequent reads and queries within the transaction see writes committed
before the first read or query.
For reads and writes
For an optimistic transaction with reads and writes, Spanner
performs a validation step at commit time. The transaction commits
successfully only if no conflicts are detected and the following conditions are
met:
No concurrently committed writes conflict with the data read by this
transaction; that is, no writes were committed after the read timestamp
but before this transaction commits its own writes.
The schema wasn't modified since the read timestamp.
The isolation level determines the set of reads that are validated. With
serializable isolation, all reads are validated. With repeatable read isolation,
reads with either a FOR UPDATE or lock_scanned_ranges=exclusive hint are
validated at commit time.
Under high contention, optimistic transactions might repeatedly abort. In
contrast, pessimistic transactions resolve read-write conflicts by allowing the
older transaction to commit and retrying the newer transaction.
Benefits of optimistic concurrency
Optimistic concurrency offers the following benefits:
Reads don't acquire locks: Optimistic transactions don't acquire locks for
reads, so long-running reads don't block latency-sensitive writes.
Reduced commit latency for read-only transactions: Because all reads
within an optimistic transaction are based on the same snapshot timestamp,
there's no need to verify consistency during execution or commit for these
reads, which significantly reduces latency.
Risks of optimistic concurrency
Optimistic concurrency introduces risks, particularly under
high read-write contention when used with serializable isolation. Understand
these risks before you use optimistic concurrency control with serializable
isolation for your workload.
Under high read-write contention, optimistic transactions might experience a
high rate of aborts, because concurrent writes might invalidate the reads of
an optimistic transaction.
With persistent high contention, a transaction might be repeatedly
aborted and never commit from transaction starvation.
Use cases for optimistic concurrency
Optimistic concurrency is suitable for transactional workloads with low
read-write contention. For serializable transactions, it also benefits workloads
that can tolerate transaction aborts.
Consider optimistic concurrency for the following workloads:
Low-priority, latency-tolerant workloads with long-running transactions:
Use optimistic concurrency if long-running reads or queries might delay
latency-sensitive writes. This avoids delays caused by read locks. For example,
transactions in mobile clients with slow connections, or low-SLA transactions
holding read locks for many rows or large ranges.
Read latency-sensitive transactional workloads with low read-write contention:
In a multi-region configuration ,
use optimistic concurrency to serve reads regionally, reduce read latencies,
and avoid production issues from spiky read traffic to a hot split.
It also improves read availability during leader overload or unavailability.
Transactional workloads where most transactions are read-only:
Switching to optimistic concurrency reduces commit latency for common
read-only transactions in these workloads. Ensure low read-write contention to
avoid high abort rates for read-write transactions.
Avoid using optimistic concurrency for latency-sensitive transactional workloads
where read-write conflicts are frequent.
Configure concurrency control
You can use the Spanner client libraries, REST, and RPC API to
specify the concurrency mode for read-write transactions.
