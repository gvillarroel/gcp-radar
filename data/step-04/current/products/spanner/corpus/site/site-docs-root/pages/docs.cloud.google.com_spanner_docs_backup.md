Backups overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides an overview of Spanner backups and
backup schedules.
Spanner lets you create full backups of
databases on demand and full or incremental backups using a backup schedule.
Full backups store the entire data of a database, whereas incremental backups
contain only the data that has changed since a previous backup.
You can restore the backups when operator or application errors
cause logical data corruption.
Backups are highly available, encrypted, and can
be retained for up to a year from the time they are created. When you create a
backup, the backup resides in the same instance, region, and project as its
source database. If you need to restore the backup in a different region or
project for compliance or business continuity reasons, you can copy the backup
to an instance in a separate region or project.
Each backup has an associated
createTime and versionTime . The createTime is the
timestamp when Spanner starts creating the backup.
The versionTime is the timestamp when the database contents are captured
in the backup. The backup contains a consistent view of the database at the
versionTime .
For on-demand backups, the createTime and versionTime are the same by
default. If needed, you can specify an older versionTime when creating
an on-demand backup if it's within the
version retention period
of the database.
For scheduled backups, the versionTime is the time you choose when you create
the backup schedule. Spanner starts creating the backup within four hours of
the versionTime , so the createTime falls within this four-hour window.
This is unlike on-demand backups, where Spanner starts creating
the backup when it receives the request.
For example, suppose you create a backup schedule with a frequency of
0 7 * * * UTC or
every day at 7:00 AM UTC. This means that for each backup, the versionTime
is set to 7:00 AM UTC and the createTime is a timestamp within the
four-hour window between 7:00 AM UTC and 11:00 AM UTC.
For more information about using createTime and versionTime using the API,
see Backup API reference .
Key features
Data consistency : Backups of a Spanner database are
transactionally and
externally consistent at the
versionTime of the backup.
Replication : Backups reside in the same instance as their source database
and are replicated in the same geographic locations.
For regional instances ,
the backup is stored in each of the three read-write zones. For
dual-region
and multi-regional instances ,
the backup is stored in all zones that contain either a read-write or
read-only replica. If you need to store the backup of your database in a
different region or project, you can copy the completed backup from the source
instance to a destination instance located in a different region or
project. For more information, see copy a backup .
Automatic expiration : All backups have a user-specified expiration date
which determines when it is automatically deleted.
Spanner deletes expired backups asynchronously, so there might
be a lag between when a backup is expired and when it's actually deleted.
Backup creation
When you create a backup, the backup resides in the same instance,
region, and project as its source database.
A backup contains the following information from the database at the
versionTime of the backup:
A full backup contains all of the data. An incremental backup contains only
the data that has changed since a previous backup.
Schema information, including table names, fields, data types, secondary
indexes, change streams, and the relationships between these entities.
All database options that are set with the
ALTER DATABASE SET OPTIONS
command.
A Spanner backup does not include the following information:
Any modifications to the data or schema after the
versionTime .
Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
Change stream data records. Although the change streams schema is stored,
the change stream data is meant to be streamed out and consumed
near-simultaneously with the changes it describes.
To help ensure external consistency of the backup, Spanner pins
the contents of the database at
versionTime .
This prevents the garbage collection
system from removing the relevant data values for the duration of the backup
operation. Then, every read-write and read-only zone in the instance begins
copying the data in parallel. If any zone is temporarily unavailable, the backup
is not complete until the zone comes back online. Backups are
restorable as soon as the operation is complete. For multi-region instances, all
read-write and read-only zones in all regions must complete their backup
replicas before the backup is marked as restorable.
Backup schedules
Spanner lets you schedule full or
incremental backups for databases. An incremental backup contains only the
data that has changed since a previous backup, whereas full backups store the
entire contents of the database. You can specify the backup
schedule type (full or incremental) and frequency for Spanner
to create backups.
A full backup schedule can create a backup every 12 hours
or more. An incremental backup schedule can create a backup every 4 hours or
more.
Spanner offers incremental backups for your database
through a backup schedule. You can't create an incremental backup on demand.
The backup creation begins within a four-hour window of the scheduled time.
You can have a maximum of four backup schedules per database.
Note: Backup schedules for newly created databases take up to 24 hours to
become active and start creating backups.
Incremental backups
Note: This feature is available with the Spanner Enterprise edition and
Enterprise Plus edition. For more information, see the Spanner editions overview .
Incremental backups form chains between full backups. The first backup
created by an incremental backup schedule is a full backup.
The consecutive backups created in the chain are incremental backups,
each containing only the data that has changed since the previous backup in the
chain.
Spanner permits up to 13 incremental backups per chain, in
addition to the initial full backup. A chain
is identified by the corresponding incrementalBackupChainId value.
When a chain reaches its maximum length,
Spanner creates a new chain, beginning with the initial full
backup.
In some scenarios, Spanner might create a new chain before
the maximum chain length occurs. The following are a few of the scenarios:
The oldest full backup was taken 28 or more days ago.
The newest backup in the chain is deleted.
The incremental backup schedule is modified.
Here are some factors that can help you make a decision
about using incremental backups:
Restoration : Restoring an incremental backup might take longer than
restoring a full backup that contains the same data.
Deletion : If you delete a backup in a chain or it expires,
Spanner might still keep the backup to support newer backups
in the chain, if any exist. Spanner needs all the older backups
in the chain to restore an incremental backup. To delete all the data in a
chain of backups, including that of expired or deleted backups, delete all
the backups in the chain.
Retention : Each backup schedule has the following terms that offer
information about the schedule:
creation_interval : represents the specified schedule frequency for the
backup
schedule.
retention_duration : represents how long the backups created by the
schedule are retained.
For a given chain, the oldest full backup is retained past its original
expiration date if it is needed to support newer backups in the chain.
The total retention duration for the full backup is at most the lower of the
following values:
retention_duration + 28 days
retention_duration + ( creation_interval *14)
Backup copy : When you copy an incremental backup, Spanner
also copies all the older backups in the chain required to restore the copied
backup. If the destination instance
already contains a backup chain ending with an older backup that was copied
from the same source chain, Spanner avoids creating redundant
copies of existing backups. Instead, Spanner copies only the
incremental backup and any older backups not present in the destination chain,
and appends these backups to the existing chain. Spanner
charges you based on the total storage used.
For example, if you set up a daily incremental backup schedule and copy the
latest backup each day, the destination instance maintains a backup chain that
mirrors the source chain. Spanner doesn't duplicate
previously copied backups within the chain during subsequent copy operations.
While Spanner aims to avoid redundant copies, in rare
situations, Spanner might need to copy all the older backups
in the chain, even if previously copied backups already exist in the
destination instance.
For more information about creating incremental backups, see
Create and manage backup schedules .
Default backup schedules
When you create a new Spanner instance, you can specify if you
want Spanner to create a default backup schedule for every new
database in the instance. The default backup schedule creates a full backup
every 24 hours. These backups have a retention period of 7 days. You can edit
or delete the default backup schedule once it's created.
Default backup schedules are automatically enabled for all new instances. You
can enable or disable default backup schedules in an instance when creating
the instance or by editing the instance later.
You can enable default backup schedules for existing instances.
However, default backup schedules don't apply to existing databases in the
instance. Default backup schedules only apply to new databases in the instance.
The default backup schedule takes 24 hours to become active and start creating
backups.
You must delete all backups in an instance before you delete an instance. If you
are creating and deleting instances for testing purposes, you can delete the new
instance within 24 hours to avoid manually deleting its backups.
For instructions on enabling or disabling default backup schedules, see
Edit the default backup schedule type .
Storage costs for full and incremental backups
Each Spanner backup has the following fields that offer
information about storage consumption:
exclusiveSizeBytes : shows the number of bytes required by the backup. This
size represents the billable size of the backup.
freeableSizeBytes : shows the number of bytes that are released if you
delete the backup.
oldestVersionTime : shows the versionTime of the oldest full backup in
the chain, even if that backup has expired. You can use this field to
understand which data is being stored.
Incremental backups can save you storage costs. An incremental backup might
have a significantly smaller exclusiveSizeBytes
field than a full backup as the incremental backup only needs to store the
changes since the previous backup in the chain.
Adding this field value for each backup in the chain
reflects the total number of bytes used by the
backups in the chain.
An incremental backup is dependent on all older backups in the same chain
for restoration.
This means that if a newer incremental backup exists, the data of all older
backups in the chain cannot be deleted from the system and the
freeableSizeBytes field for all older backups in the same chain is zero.
Consider that you created a full backup schedule and an incremental backup
schedule for a database that has a size of 100 GB and increases by
10 GB every day. The following table shows possible storage costs for
these backup schedules:
Day
Full schedule backup size
Incremental schedule backup size
1
100 GB
100 GB
2
110 GB
10 GB
3
120 GB
10 GB
4
130 GB
10 GB
5
140 GB
10 GB
Over 5 days, the full backup schedule uses 600 GB of storage, while the
incremental backup schedule uses about 140 GB of storage.
For an incremental backup schedule, the full backup size is the sum of the sizes
of all backups in the chain, up to that backup and is reflected in the
sizeBytes field.
Comparing backup storage to database storage
The storage size of a backup can be smaller or larger than the storage size of
the source database when the backup was created.
A backup's storage can be smaller than the database's storage because the backup
contains only one version of the data, whereas the live database can contain
multiple versions of data due to ongoing operations. Differences in data format
and compression can also result in a smaller backup size.
Conversely, the storage of a backup can be larger than the database's storage,
depending on the situation of the database and the time when you take the
backup.
For similar reasons, when you restore a database from a backup, the backup's
storage can be larger than the database's storage. This might occur if a large
set of data was deleted and compacted after the backup was taken. Therefore, the
backup size depends on when the backup was taken and the subsequent operations
on the database.
There is no formula to predict the exact ratio of a backup's size relative to
the live database. For a database with a high rate of writes (a hot database ),
the backup is likely smaller than the live database. However, in some rare
situations, the backup size can be larger.
How backup copying works
Spanner lets you copy
a backup of your Spanner database from one instance to another
instance in a different region or project, to provide additional
data protection and compliance capabilities.
You can't copy a backup if the target or source Google Cloud region is down.
To protect your data if there's a region outage, you need to periodically copy
your backups to a location outside of the affected region.
The copied backup has
the same key features as the original
backup. Additionally, you can
restore
a copied backup in the same instance as the copied backup to support
cross-region and cross-project backup and restore use cases.
Where Spanner backups are stored
Backups are resources in Spanner.
Each backup resource is organized
under the same instance as its source database in the
resource hierarchy
and has a resource path that uses the following format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_ID /backups/ BACKUP_NAME
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID.
INSTANCE_ID : the instance ID.
BACKUP_NAME : the backup name.
A backup continues to exist even after its source database has been deleted,
but it can't outlive its parent instance. To prevent accidental deletion of
backups, you can't delete a Spanner instance if it has
backups. If you want to delete the instance, we recommend restoring the
backup, then exporting the restored database , before
deleting the backup and the instance.
Encryption
Spanner backups, like databases, are encrypted by either
Google-owned and Google-managed encryption keys or by
customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) . By default, a
backup uses the same
encryption configuration
as its database, but you can override this behavior by specifying a different
encryption configuration when creating the backup. If the backup is CMEK-enabled,
it is encrypted using the primary version of the KMS key at the time of backup
creation. After the backup is created, its key and key version can't be
modified, even if the KMS key is rotated. For more information, see
create a CMEK-enabled backup .
A copied backup uses the same encryption configuration, either
Google-owned and Google-managed encryption keys or
customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) , as its source
backup encryption.
You can override this behavior by specifying a different encryption
configuration when copying the backup. If you want the copied backup to be
encrypted with CMEK when copying across regions, specify the
Cloud Key Management Service key
key corresponding to the destination region.
You can specify the encryption configuration when creating or modifying
the backup schedule. If you want the backup schedule to create backups that are
encrypted by CMEK keys, you need to specify the key path.
Performance
This section describes optimal backup performance in Spanner.
Performance when backing up
When performing a backup, Spanner creates a backup job to copy
data directly from the database to backup storage, and sizes this job based on
the size of the database. This backup job does not use CPU resources allocated
to the database's instance so it does not affect the instance's performance.
Moreover, compute load on the database's instance does not affect the speed of
the backup operation. To track the progress and completion of a backup
operation, see Show backup progress .
Generally, most backups take 1-4 hours. Some backups might
take longer due to their size or because there is internal queueing for
resources. If a backup is taking longer than usual when no other factors have
changed, it might be due to a delay in scheduling the backup task in a zone.
This can sometimes take up to 30 minutes. We recommend that you do not cancel
and restart the backup, as it's likely you'll encounter the same scheduling
delay with the new backup operation.
Performance when copying a backup
The time it takes to copy a backup depends on factors such as the size of the
source backup and the destination region chosen for the copied backup.
Generally, most copies complete in 1-4 hours. Some copies might take longer
depending on the backup size and destination region. Copying a backup
doesn't have any performance implications on the source instance or database.
You can make multiple, concurrent copies of the source backup to instances in
different regions without any performance implications.
When you copy an incremental backup, Spanner also copies all of
the older backups in the chain required to restore the copied backup. To improve
performance, Spanner copies all the backups simultaneously
instead of sequentially. Spanner also attempts to avoid copying
older backups in the same chain when possible. For more information, see
Incremental backups .
Delete a backup
When you delete a backup in an incremental backup chain, you can't recover
storage if there are newer backups present in the chain. The newer backups
depend on the data present in the deleted backup and the
older backups in the chain. Spanner retains the
data and only releases the storage when all the newer incremental backups
expire. The freeableSizeBytes field shows how much storage space you can
regain if you delete the backup.
Pricing
You are billed based on the amount of storage used by your backups per unit
time. Billing begins after the backup operation is complete and continues
until the backup is deleted. A completed backup is billed for a minimum
of 24 hours. If you create a backup and then delete it soon after it finishes,
you are still billed for 24 hours.
A copy of a backup is subject to the
same storage costs
as an original backup. If you create a copy between two instances that occupy
different regions, then
outbound data transfer costs
apply.
For example, if you copy your database from the source multi-region instance
configuration nam7 to the destination multi-region instance configuration
nam-eur-asia3 , the following charges apply:
No charge for overlapping us-central1 region
No charge for witness us-central2 region
Inter-continental data transfer charge apply twice: once for each new
continent (Europe and Asia)
Data transfer between regions within the same continent charge apply once
for us-east1
Data transfer between regions within the same continent charge apply once
in Europe
Spanner optimizes the copying process to minimize the number of
cross-region transfers. This helps to minimize the data transfer costs while
providing a fast copy backup experience.
Backups are stored and billed separately. Backup storage does not affect
billing for database storage
or database storage limits . For more
information, also see
Storage utilization metrics .
