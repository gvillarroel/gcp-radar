This page explains how to use the Kafka connector to consume
and forward Spanner change streams data.
Core concepts
The following describes core concepts of the Kafka connector.
Debezium
Debezium is an open source project that provides
a low latency data streaming platform for change data capture.
Kafka connector
The Kafka connector provides an abstraction over the Spanner API to
publish Spanner change streams to Kafka. With this connector,
you don't have to manage the change streams partition lifecycle,
which is necessary when you use the Spanner API directly .
The Kafka connector produces a change event for every data change record mod and sends
change event records downstream into a separate Kafka topic for each change stream-tracked table.
A data change record mod represents a single modification (insert, update, or delete) that was captured. A single data change record can contain more than one mod.
Kafka connector output
The Kafka connector forwards change streams records directly
into a separate Kafka topic. The output topic name should be connector_name . table_name .
If the topic doesn't exist, the Kafka connector automatically creates a topic under that name.
You can also configure topic routing transformations to re-route records into topics that you specify. If you want to use topic routing, disable the low watermark functionality.
Record ordering
Records are ordered by commit timestamp per primary key in
the Kafka topics. Records belonging to different primary keys do not have
ordering guarantees. Records with the same primary key are stored in the
same Kafka topic partition. If you want to process whole transactions, you can
also use the data change record's
server_transaction_id and number_of_records_in_transaction fields to
assemble a Spanner transaction.
Change events
The Kafka connector generates a data change event for each INSERT , UPDATE ,
and DELETE operation. Each event contains a key and values for the changed row.
You can use Kafka Connect converters to produce data change events in
Protobuf , AVRO , JSON , or JSON Schemaless formats. If you use a
Kafka Connect converter that produces schemas, the event contains
separate schemas for the key and values. Otherwise, the event only contains
the key and values.
The schema for the key never changes. The schema for the values is an
amalgamation of all the columns the change stream has tracked since the
connector start time.
If you configure the connector to produce JSON events, the output change event
contains five fields:
The first schema field specifies a Kafka Connect schema that describes the Spanner key schema.
The first payload field has the structure described by the previous schema field and contains the key for the row that was changed.
The second schema field specifies the Kafka Connect schema that describes the schema for the changed row.
The second payload field has the structure described by the previous schema field and it contains the actual data for the row that was changed.
The source field is a mandatory field that describes the source metadata for the event.
The following is an example of a data change event:
{
// The schema for the Spanner key.

"type": "struct",

// time.

Low watermark
The low watermark describes the time T at which the Kafka connector is guaranteed to have streamed out and published to a Kafka topic all events with timestamp < T.
You can enable the low watermark in the Kafka connector using the
gcp.spanner.low-watermark.enabled parameter. This parameter is disabled
by default. If the low watermark is enabled, the low_watermark field in the change stream data
change record is populated with the Kafka connector's current low watermark
timestamp.
If there are no records being produced, the Kafka connector sends periodic
watermark "heartbeats" to the Kafka output topics detected by the connector.
These watermark heartbeats are records that are empty except for the
low_watermark field. You can then use the low watermark to perform time-based aggregations.
For example, you can use the low watermark to order events by commit
timestamp across primary keys.
Metadata topics
The Kafka connector, as well as the Kafka Connect framework, creates several
metadata topics to store connector-related information. It is not advisable to
modify either the configuration or the content of these metadata topics.
The following are the metadata topics:
_consumer_offsets : A topic automatically created by Kafka.
Stores consumer offsets for consumers created in the Kafka connector.
_kafka-connect-offsets : A topic automatically created by Kafka Connect. Stores the connector offsets.
_sync_topic_spanner_connector_connectorname : A topic automatically created by the connector. Stores metadata regarding change stream partitions.
_rebalancing_topic_spanner_connector_connectorname : A topic automatically created by the connector. Used to determine connector task aliveness.
_debezium-heartbeat.connectorname : A topic used to process Spanner change stream heartbeats.
Kafka connector runtime
The following describes the Kafka connector runtime.
Scalability
The Kafka connector is horizontally scalable and runs on one or more tasks spread out among multiple Kafka Connect workers.
Message delivery guarantees
The Kafka connector supports at-least-once delivery guarantee.
Fault tolerance
The Kafka connector is tolerant of failures. As the Kafka connector reads changes and
produces events, it records the last commit timestamp processed for each change
stream partition. If the Kafka connector stops for any reason (including
communication failures, network problems, or software failures), upon restart
the Kafka connector continues streaming records where it last left off.
The Kafka connector reads the information schema at the Kafka connector's start
timestamp to retrieve schema information. By default, Spanner cannot
read the information schema at read timestamps before the
version retention period ,
which defaults to one hour. If you want to start the connector from earlier than
one hour into the past, you must increase the database's version retention
period.
Set up the Kafka connector
Create a change stream
For details on how to create a change stream, see Create a change stream . To continue with the next steps, a Spanner instance with a change stream configured is required.
Note that if you want both changed and unchanged columns to be returned on each
data change event, use the value capture type NEW_ROW . For more information, see value capture type .
Install the Kafka connector JAR
With Zookeeper , Kafka , and Kafka Connect installed, the remaining tasks to deploy a Kafka connector are to download
the connector's plug-in archive , extract the JAR files into your Kafka Connect environment, and add the
directory with the JAR files to Kafka Connect's plugin.path .
You then need to restart your Kafka Connect process to pick up the new JAR files.
If you are working with immutable containers, you can pull images from
Debezium's Container images for
Zookeeper, Kafka and Kafka Connect. The Kafka Connect image has the
Spanner connector pre-installed.
For more information on how to install Debezium-based Kafka connector JARs, see
Installing Debezium .
Configure the Kafka connector
The following is an example of the configuration for a Kafka connector
that connects to a change stream called changeStreamAll in the
database users in instance test-instance and project test-project .
"name" : "spanner-connector" ,
"config" : {
"connector.class" : "io.debezium.connector.spanner.SpannerConnector" ,
"gcp.spanner.project.id" : "test-project" ,
"gcp.spanner.instance.id" : "test-instance" ,
"gcp.spanner.database.id" : "users" ,
"gcp.spanner.change.stream" : "changeStreamAll" ,
"gcp.spanner.credentials.json" : "{" client_id ": user@example.com}" ,
"gcp.spanner.database.role" : "cdc-role" ,
"tasks.max" : "10"
}
This configuration contains the following:
The name of the connector when registered with a Kafka Connect service.
The name of this Spanner connector class.
The Project ID.
The Spanner Instance ID.
The Spanner Database ID.
The change stream name.
The JSON object for the service account key.
(Optional) The Spanner database role to use.
The maximum number of tasks.
For a complete list of connector properties, see Kafka connector configuration properties .
Add the connector configuration to Kafka Connect
To start running a Spanner connector:
Create a configuration for the Spanner connector.
Use the Kafka Connect REST API to add that
connector configuration to your Kafka Connect cluster.
You can send this configuration with a POST command to a running Kafka Connect
service. By default, the Kafka Connect service runs on port 8083 .
The service records the configuration and start the connector task
that connects to the Spanner database and streams change event records to
Kafka topics.
The following is an example POST command:
POST /connectors HTTP/1.1
Host: http://localhost:8083
Accept: application/json
{
"name": "spanner-connector"
"config": {
"connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.spanner.SpannerConnector",
"gcp.spanner.project.id": "test-project",
"gcp.spanner.instance.id": "test-instance",
"gcp.spanner.database.id": "users",
"gcp.spanner.change.stream": "changeStreamAll",
"gcp.spanner.credentials.json": "{\"client_id\": \"XXXX\".... }",
"heartbeat.interval.ms": "100",
"tasks.max": "10"
}
}
Example successful response:
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
{
"name": "spanner-connector",
"config": {
"connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.spanner.SpannerConnector",
"gcp.spanner.project.id": "test-project",
"gcp.spanner.instance.id": "test-instance",
"gcp.spanner.database.id": "users",
"gcp.spanner.change.stream": "changeStreamAll",
"gcp.spanner.credentials.json": "{\"client_id\": \"XXXX\".... }",
"heartbeat.interval.ms": "100",
"tasks.max": "10"
},
"tasks": [
{ "connector": "spanner-connector", "task": 1 },
{ "connector": "spanner-connector", "task": 2 },
{ "connector": "spanner-connector", "task": 3 }
]
}
Update the Kafka connector configuration
To update the connector configuration, send a PUT command to the running
Kafka Connect service with the same connector name.
Assume that we have a connector running with the configuration from
the previous section. The following is an example PUT command:
PUT /connectors/spanner-connector/config HTTP/1.1
Host: http://localhost:8083
Accept: application/json
{
"connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.spanner.SpannerConnector",
"gcp.spanner.project.id": "test-project",
"gcp.spanner.instance.id": "test-instance",
"gcp.spanner.database.id": "users",
"gcp.spanner.change.stream": "changeStreamAll",
"gcp.spanner.credentials.json": "{\"client_id\": \"XXXX\".... }",
"heartbeat.interval.ms": "100",
"tasks.max": "10"
}
Example successful response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
"connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.spanner.SpannerConnector",
"tasks.max": "10",
"gcp.spanner.project.id": "test-project",
"gcp.spanner.instance.id": "test-instance",
"gcp.spanner.database.id": "users",
"gcp.spanner.change.stream": "changeStreamAll",
"gcp.spanner.credentials.json": "{\"client_id\": \"XXXX\".... }",
"heartbeat.interval.ms": "100",
"tasks.max": "10"
}
Stop the Kafka connector
To stop the connector, send a DELETE command to the running
Kafka Connect service with the same connector name.
Assume that we have a connector running with the configuration from
the previous section. The following is an example DELETE command:
DELETE /connectors/spanner-connector HTTP/1.1
Host: http://localhost:8083
Example successful response:
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

The following are required configuration properties for the connector:
name : Unique name for the connector. Attempting to register again with the same name causes failure. This property is required by all Kafka Connect connectors.
connector.class : The name of the Java class for the connector. Always use a value of io.debezium.connector.spanner.SpannerConnector for the Kafka connector.
tasks.max : The maximum number of tasks that should be created for this connector.

fine-grained access control. The database role must have the SELECT privilege on the
change stream and the EXECUTE privilege on the change stream's read
function. For more information, see Fine-grained access control for change
streams .
