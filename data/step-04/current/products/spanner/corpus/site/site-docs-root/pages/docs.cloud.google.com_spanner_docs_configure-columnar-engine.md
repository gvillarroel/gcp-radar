— Spanner columnar engine
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Note: This feature is available with the Spanner Enterprise edition and
Enterprise Plus edition. For more information, see the Spanner editions overview .
PostgreSQL interface note:
The examples in this topic are intended for GoogleSQL-dialect databases. This feature doesn't support
PostgreSQL interface.
This page describes how to enable Spanner columnar engine on a
database, table, or index, and accelerate file format generation.
Enable Spanner columnar engine
Spanner columnar engine is enabled using a SET OPTIONS clause
with the columnar_policy option. You can apply this option when you create or
alter DATABASE , TABLE , or INDEX schema objects. SEARCH INDEX and
VECTOR INDEX schema objects are never in columnar format.
Lower levels in a database and table hierarchy inherit the columnar_policy
from its parent. You can change this setting at lower levels.
The columnar_policy option has the following flags:
'enabled' or 'disabled' turns the columnar engine on or off for the
specific schema object.
NULL (default) uses the columnar engine policy from the parent object,
if one exists. NULL clears previous settings on a table object.
You can also omit OPTIONS to inherit the columnar_policy from the parent
object.
The following example shows how to:
Create a database with the columnar policy enabled.
Define a Singers table that inherits the columnar policy from the database
(omit the columnar_policy = NULL for the table option).
Define a Concerts table with the columnar policy explicitly disabled.
CREATE DATABASE Music ;
ALTER DATABASE Music SET OPTIONS ( columnar_policy = 'enabled' );
CREATE TABLE Singers (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
FirstName STRING ( 1024 ),
LastName STRING ( 1024 ),
BirthDate DATE ,
Status STRING ( 1024 ),
LastUpdated TIMESTAMP ,)
PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId );
CREATE TABLE Concerts (
VenueId INT64 NOT NULL ,
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
ConcertDate DATE NOT NULL ,
BeginTime TIMESTAMP ,
EndTime TIMESTAMP ,)
PRIMARY KEY ( VenueId , SingerId , ConcertDate ),
OPTIONS ( columnar_policy = 'disabled' );
You can also use ALTER TABLE with the SET OPTIONS clause to enable or
disable the columnar_policy on a table. The following example shows how to
disable the policy in the Singers table:
ALTER TABLE Singers SET OPTIONS ( columnar_policy = 'disabled' );
Note: Enabling Spanner columnar engine increases the
storage usage of the target database or table (depending on the enabling option
used) by approximately 60%. The exact increase depends on the type of data and
its compressibility properties. It's important to ensure that the
Spanner instance has sufficient storage capacity to accommodate
the increase in storage usage. For more information, see
Database limits .
Columnar file format generation
Spanner generates the columnar file format at compaction time.
Compaction is a background process that typically is spread out over multiple
days, but it might happen sooner if the size of the database grows
substantially. For more information, see
Optimal columnar coverage .
If you create a new database without data and enable columnar engine,
Spanner stores data in columnar format as you insert it and as
compactions occur in the background.
Columnar data format isn't generated for backups.
When you enable Spanner columnar engine on an existing database
that has data in it, Spanner provides a mechanism to manually
trigger compactions. For more information, see
Manually trigger a data compaction .
