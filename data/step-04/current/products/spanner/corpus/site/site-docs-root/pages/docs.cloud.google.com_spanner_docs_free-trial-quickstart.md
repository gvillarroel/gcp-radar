free trial instances overview .
Get started with a free trial instance
A Spanner 90-day free trial instance is available to anyone
with a Google Account who has Cloud Billing enabled in their project. You
aren't charged unless you choose to
upgrade
your free trial instance to a paid instance.
You can create a free trial instance using the Google Cloud console or
Google Cloud CLI.
Note: You can only create one free trial instance per project lifecycle, and a
maximum of five free trial instances per Cloud Billing account.
Before you begin
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Spanner page.
Go to Spanner
Select or create a Google Cloud project if you haven't done so already.
If Cloud Billing is already enabled for your project, proceed to
Create free trial instance
in the next section.
If Cloud Billing is not enabled for your project, link an existing
Cloud Billing account or create a new Cloud Billing account.
Google uses this payment information to verify your identity. We don't
charge your Spanner instance unless you explicitly upgrade
your Cloud Billing account to a paid account ,
and you upgrade your Spanner free trial instance to a paid
instance .
a. Click Go to billing .
b. Then, click Link a billing account .
Note: If you're a new Google Cloud customer, you might also be eligible for
the Google Cloud 90-day, $300 Free Trial
that offers $300 in free Cloud Billing credits to pay for any Google Cloud
resources. The Spanner free trial instance is in addition to
the $300 Free Trial credits offered by the Google Cloud Free Trial, and you
don't need to use any free Cloud Billing credits to create a
free trial instance.
c. Follow the steps to Create billing account , and then link it to your
project.
d. After you enable Cloud Billing for your project, go to the
Spanner page.
Go to Spanner

Create a free trial instance
Google Cloud console
The following steps explain how to create a free trial instance using the
Google Cloud console.
On the Create your free trial instance page, do the following:
Enter the Instance name to display in the Google Cloud console.
The instance must be unique within your Google Cloud project.
Enter the Instance ID to permanantly identify your instance. The
instance ID must also be unique within your Google Cloud project. You
can't change the instance ID later.
Select a configuration location from the Region drop-down menu.
Your instance configuration determines the geographic location where your
instance is stored and replicated. You can create a free trial instance
in any of the Spanner regional instance configurations .
For a full list of all available instance configurations, see
Regional, dual-region, and multi-region configurations .
Click Create free instance .
After you create your free trial instance, Spanner
creates a sample database for you to explore and familiarize yourself with
Spanner features. For more information, see
Free trial instances overview .
gcloud
To create a free trial instance, use the
gcloud spanner instances create
command.
gcloud spanner instances create INSTANCE_ID \
-- instance - type = free - instance -- config = INSTANCE_CONFIG \
-- description = INSTANCE_DESCRIPTION
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_ID : a permanent identifier that is unique within
your Google Cloud project. You can't change the instance ID later.
INSTANCE_CONFIG : a permanent identifier of your instance
configuration, which defines the geographic location of the instance.
You can create a free trial instance in any of the Spanner
regional instance configurations :
INSTANCE_DESCRIPTION : the name to display for the instance in the
Google Cloud console. The instance name must be unique within your
Google Cloud project.
For example, to create a free trial instance named trial-instance with the
display name Trial Instance using the regional instance configuration
regional-us-east5 , run the following:
gcloud spanner instances create trial - instance -- config = regional - us - east5 \
-- instance - type = free - instance -- description = "Trial Instance"
Note: Use the instance ID, not the display name, when referring to an instance
in gcloud CLI commands.
After you create your free trial instance, you are prompted to continue
learning and exploring Spanner by launching a step-by-step
tutorial that teaches you how to create a database using a sample
application. For more information, see
Get started with a sample application .
Get started with a sample database
After you create your free trial instance using the Google Cloud console,
Spanner creates a sample database for you to explore and
familiarize yourself with Spanner features.
You can access the sample database by using the Google Cloud console.
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Spanner Instances page.
Go to the Instances page
Click the name of the free trial instance.
Click the name of the sample database.
You can view the tables and data in the sample database. You can also
access and view saved queries on the Spanner Studio page. The
saved queries showcase different Spanner features and
capabilities.
Get started with a sample application
Spanner also offers an open source
sample application
to help you get started with the Spanner free trial instance.
The sample application consists of a backend gRPC service backed by a
Spanner database and a workload generator that drives traffic to
the service.
You can access the sample application by using the Google Cloud CLI.
gcloud
Complete the steps described in the gcloud set up ,
which covers creating and setting a default Google Cloud project,
enabling the Cloud Spanner API, and setting up OAuth 2.0 to get authentication
credentials to use the Cloud Spanner API.
Run the gcloud auth application-default login
command to set up your local development environment with authentication
credentials.
Run the gcloud spanner samples run
command to download the sample application and start the backend gRPC
service and workload generator for the given sample application:
gcloud spanner samples run APPNAME --instance-id INSTANCE_ID
For more information and a list of other available commands for the
sample application, see the gcloud CLI documentation .
Import your own data
You can import your own data into a Spanner database by using a
CSV file, a MySQL dump file, or a PostgreSQL dump file. You can upload
a local file using Cloud Storage or from a Cloud Storage bucket directly.
Uploading a local file using Cloud Storage might incur charges.
If you choose to use a CSV file, you also need to upload a separate JSON file
that contains the database schema.
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Spanner Instances page.
Go to Spanner instances
Select the instance to create the database in.
Click Import my own data .
Enter the following values:
Select the File type .
Upload the file from your computer or select a Cloud Storage bucket
path to the file.
(Optional) If you choose to use a CSV file, you also need to
upload a separate JSON file that contains the database schema. The JSON
file must use the following structure to define the schema:
{
"name" : " COLUMN_NAME " ,
"type" : " TYPE " ,
"notNull" : NOT_NULL_VALUE ,
"primaryKeyOrder" : PRIMARY_KEY_ORDER
}
Replace the following:
COLUMN_NAME : the name of the column in the table.
TYPE : the data type of the column.
(Optional) NOT_NULL_VALUE : whether the column
can store null values or not. Valid inputs are true or false .
Defaults to false .
(Optional): PRIMARY_KEY_ORDER : determines the
primary key order. Set the value is set to 0 for a non-primary
key column. Set the value to an integer, for example, 1 for a
primary key column. Lower numbered columns appear earlier in a
compound primary key.
The CSV file expects a comma for the field delimiter and a new line for
the line delimiter by default. For more information on using custom
delimiters, see the
gcloud alpha spanner databases import reference.
Select a new or existing database as the destination.
Click Import .
Spanner opens the Cloud Shell and populates a
command that installs the
Spanner migration tool and runs the
gcloud alpha spanner databases import command. Press the ENTER key to import data into your
database.x
