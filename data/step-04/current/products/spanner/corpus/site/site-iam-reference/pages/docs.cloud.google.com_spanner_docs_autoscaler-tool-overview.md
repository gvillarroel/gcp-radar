This page introduces the Autoscaler tool for Spanner (Autoscaler), an
open source tool that you
can use as a companion tool to Spanner. This tool
lets you automatically increase or reduce the compute capacity in one or more
Spanner instances based on how much capacity is in use.
For more information about scaling in Spanner, see
Autoscaling Spanner . For
information about deploying the Autoscaler tool, see the following:
Deploy the Autoscaler tool for Spanner to Cloud Run functions .
Deploy the Autoscaler tool for Spanner to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) .
This page presents the features, architecture, and high-level configuration
of the Autoscaler. These topics guide you through the deployment of the
Autoscaler to one of the supported runtimes in each of the different topologies.
Autoscaler
The Autoscaler tool is useful for managing the utilization and performance of your
Spanner deployments. To help you to balance cost control with
performance needs, the Autoscaler tool monitors your instances and automatically
adds or removes nodes or processing units to help ensure that they stay within
the following parameters:
The recommended maximums for CPU utilization .
The recommended limit for storage per node .
Plus or minus a configurable margin .
Autoscaling Spanner deployments enables your infrastructure to
automatically adapt and scale to meet load requirements with little to no
intervention. Autoscaling also right-sizes the provisioned infrastructure, which
can help you to minimize incurred charges.
Architecture
The Autoscaler has two main components, the Poller and the Scaler .
Although you can deploy the Autoscaler with varying configurations to multiple
runtimes in multiple topologies with varying configurations, the functionality
of these core components is the same.
This section describes these two components and their purposes in more detail.
Poller
The Poller
collects and processes the time-series metrics for one or
more Spanner instances. The Poller preprocesses the metrics data for
each Spanner instance so that only the most relevant data points are
evaluated and sent to the Scaler. The preprocessing done by the Poller also
simplifies the process of evaluating thresholds for regional, dual-region, and
multi-regional Spanner instances.
Scaler
The Scaler
evaluates the data points received from the Poller component, and
determines whether you need to adjust the number of nodes or processing units
and, if so, by how much. The
compares the metric values to the threshold, plus or minus an allowed
margin ,
and adjusts the number of nodes or processing units based on the configured
scaling method. For more details, see
Scaling methods .
Throughout the flow, the Autoscaler tool writes a summary of its recommendations
and actions to
Cloud Logging
for tracking and auditing.
Autoscaler features
This section describes the main features of the Autoscaler tool.
Manage multiple instances
The Autoscaler tool is able to manage multiple Spanner instances across
multiple projects. Multi-regional, dual-region, and regional instances all have
different utilization thresholds that are used when scaling. For example,
multi-regional and dual-region deployments are scaled at 45% high-priority CPU
utilization, whereas regional deployments are scaled at 65% high-priority CPU
utilization, both plus or minus an allowed
margin .
For more information on the different thresholds for scaling, see
Alerts for high CPU utilization .
Independent configuration parameters
Each autoscaled Spanner instance can have one or more polling
schedules. Each polling schedule has its own set of configuration parameters.
These parameters determine the following factors:
The minimum and maximum number of nodes or processing units that control how
small or large your instance can be, helping you to control incurred charges.
The scaling method
used to adjust your Spanner instance specific to your workload.
The cooldown periods
to let Spanner manage data splits.
Scaling methods
The Autoscaler tool provides three different scaling methods for up and down
scaling your Spanner instances: stepwise , linear , and
direct . Each method is designed to support different types of workloads.
You can apply one or more methods to each Spanner instance being
autoscaled when you create independent polling schedules.
The following sections contain further information on these scaling methods.
Stepwise
Stepwise scaling is useful for workloads that have small or multiple peaks. It
provisions capacity to smooth them all out with a single autoscaling event.
The following chart shows a load pattern with multiple load plateaus or steps,
where each step has multiple small peaks. This pattern is well suited for the
stepwise method.
When the load threshold is crossed, this method provisions and removes nodes or
processing units using a fixed but configurable number. For example, three nodes
are added or removed for each scaling action. By changing the configuration, you
can allow for larger increments of capacity to be added or removed at any time.
Linear
Linear scaling is best used with load patterns that change more gradually or
have a few large peaks. The method calculates the minimum number of nodes or
processing units required to keep utilization below the scaling threshold. The
number of nodes or processing units added or removed in each scaling event is
not limited to a fixed step amount.
The sample load pattern in the following chart shows large, sudden increases and
decreases in load. These fluctuations are not grouped in discernible steps as
they are in the previous chart. This pattern might be better handled using
linear scaling.
The Autoscaler tool uses the ratio of the observed utilization over the
utilization threshold to calculate whether to add or subtract nodes or
processing units from the current total number.
The formula to calculate the new number of nodes or processing units is as
follows:
newSize = currentSize * currentUtilization / utilizationThreshold
Direct
Direct scaling provides an immediate increase in capacity. This method is
intended to support batch workloads where a predetermined higher node count is
periodically required on a schedule with a known start time. This method scales
the instance up to the maximum number of nodes or processing units specified in
the schedule, and is intended to be used in addition to a linear or stepwise
method.
The following chart depicts the large planned increase in load, which Autoscaler
pre-provisioned capacity for using the direct method.
Once the batch workload has completed and utilization returns to normal levels,
depending on your configuration, either linear or stepwise scaling is applied to
scale the instance down automatically.
Configuration
The Autoscaler tool has different configuration options that you can use to
manage the scaling of your Spanner deployments. Though the
Cloud Run functions and GKE parameters
are similar, they are supplied differently. For more information on
configuring the Autoscaler tool, see
Configuring a Cloud Run functions deployment
and
Configuring a GKE deployment .
Advanced configuration
The Autoscaler tool has advanced configuration options that let you more finely
control when and how your Spanner instances are managed. The following
sections introduce a selection of these controls.
Custom thresholds
The Autoscaler tool determines the number of nodes or processing units to be
added or subtracted to an instance using the
recommended Spanner thresholds
for the following load metrics:
High priority CPU
24-hour rolling average CPU
Storage utilization
We recommend that you use the default thresholds as described in
Creating alerts for Spanner metrics .
However, in some cases you might want to modify the thresholds used by
the Autoscaler tool. For example, you could use lower thresholds to make the
Autoscaler tool react more quickly than for higher thresholds. This modification
helps to prevent alerts being triggered at higher thresholds.
Custom metrics
While the default metrics in the Autoscaler tool address most performance and
scaling scenarios, there are some instances when you might need to specify your
own metrics used for determining when to scale in and out. For these scenarios,
you define custom metrics in the configuration using the
metrics
property.
Margins
A margin defines an upper and a lower limit around the threshold. The Autoscaler
tool only triggers an autoscaling event if the value of the metric is more than
the upper limit or less than the lower limit.
The objective of this parameter is to avoid autoscaling events being triggered
for small workload fluctuations around the threshold, reducing the amount of fluctuation in Autoscaler actions. The threshold and margin together define the
following range, according to what you want the metric value to be:
[threshold - margin, threshold + margin]
The smaller the margin, the narrower the range, resulting in a higher
probability that an autoscaling event is triggered.
Specifying a margin parameter for a metric is optional, and it defaults to five
percentage points both preceding and below the parameter.
Data splits
Spanner assigns ranges of data called splits to nodes or subdivisions
of a node called processing units. The node or processing units independently
manage and serve the data in the apportioned splits. Data splits are created
based on several factors, including data volume and access patterns. For more
details, see
Spanner - schema and data model .
Note: Spanner charges you each hour for the maximum number of nodes or
processing units that exist during that hour, multiplied by the hourly rate. As
a result, any nodes or processing units that you provision are billed for a
minimum of one hour. We don't recommend that you optimize your Autoscaler
configuration for intra-hour scale-ins. For more information, see the
Spanner pricing overview .
Data is organized into splits and Spanner automatically manages the
splits. So, when the Autoscaler tool adds or removes nodes or processing units,
it needs to allow the Spanner backend sufficient time to reassign and
reorganize the splits as new capacity is added or removed from instances.
The Autoscaler tool uses cooldown periods on both scale-up and scale-down events
to control how quickly it can add or remove nodes or processing units from an
instance. This method allows the instance the necessary time to reorganize the
relationships between compute notes or processing units and data splits. By
default, the scale-up and scale-down cooldown periods are set to the following
minimum values:
Scale-up value: 5 minutes
Scale-down value: 30 minutes
For more information about scaling recommendations and cooldown periods, see
Scaling Spanner Instances .
Pricing
The Autoscaler tool resource consumption is minor in terms of compute, memory,
and storage. Depending on your configuration of the Autoscaler, when deployed
to Cloud Run functions the Autoscaler's resource utilization is usually
in the Free Tier of its
dependent services (Cloud Run functions, Cloud Scheduler,
Pub/Sub, and Firestore).
Note: This analysis doesn't include incurred charges for the
Spanner instances that are managed by the Autoscaler.
These charges include only the components of the Autoscaler. See the
Spanner pricing page
for more information on pricing for Spanner instances.
