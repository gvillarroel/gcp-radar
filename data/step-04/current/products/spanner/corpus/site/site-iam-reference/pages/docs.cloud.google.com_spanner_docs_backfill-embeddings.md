Generate vector embeddings for textual data in bulk using partitioned DML
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document explains how to generate and backfill vector embeddings in bulk
for textual data ( STRING or JSON ) that is stored in
Spanner using SQL and the Vertex AI text embedding models .
Tip: We recommend backfilling your embeddings at a time when you're not making
a large number of updates to the text data that you're generating embeddings
for. This is to minimize lock contention and maintain low latency in your
database.
Prerequisites
You must have a table in your Spanner database that contains
textual data ( STRING or JSON ). For more information about importing data,
see the Spanner import and export overview .
Example use case
Suppose you have a table in Spanner with the following schema.
This table contains millions of records.
GoogleSQL
CREATE TABLE Products (
product_id INT64 NOT NULL ,
name STRING ( MAX ),
description STRING ( MAX )
) PRIMARY KEY ( product_id );
PostgreSQL
CREATE TABLE Products (
product_id INT8 NOT NULL ,
name TEXT ,
description TEXT ,
PRIMARY KEY ( product_id )
);
Your goal is to generate vector embeddings for the description column in this
table to find similar items to recommend to customers to improve their shopping
experience using vector search .
Register an embedding model
GoogleSQL
Register a text embedding model with the
Vertex AI model endpoint
in your Spanner database:
CREATE MODEL MODEL_NAME
INPUT (
content STRING ( MAX )
)
OUTPUT (
embeddings STRUCT<values ARRAY<FLOAT32> >
)
REMOTE OPTIONS (
endpoint = '//aiplatform.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /publishers/google/models/ $MODEL_NAME ' ,
default_batch_size = 5
)
Replace the following:
MODEL_NAME : the name of the Vertex AI text embedding model
PROJECT : the project hosting the Vertex AI endpoint
LOCATION : the location of the Vertex AI endpoint
PostgreSQL
In the PostgreSQL dialect, there is no need to register the model.
You pass the endpoint name directly to the spanner.ML_PREDICT_ROW function call.
For best practices, consider the following:
To maintain isolation of quotas, use an endpoint in a different project to
generate and backfill embeddings than the production endpoint. Reserve the
production endpoint to serve production traffic.
Make sure that the model endpoint supports the value of default_batch_size .
You can override the default_batch_size with the query hint
@{remote_udf_max_rows_per_rpc=NEW_NUMBER} . For information about the
default_batch_size limit for each region, see
Get text embeddings for a snippet of text .
Define the endpoint with a specific model version (e.g. @003 ) instead of
@latest . This is because the embedding vectors generated for the same piece
of text might differ depending on the version of the model that you use; which
is why you want to avoid using different model versions to generate embeddings
in the same dataset. In addition, updating the model version in the model
definition statement doesn't update the embeddings that are already generated
with this model. One way to manage the model version for embeddings is to
create an additional column in the table which stores the model version.
Custom tuned text embedding models aren't supported with
the GoogleSQL ML.PREDICT and PostgreSQL
spanner.ML_PREDICT_ROW functions.
Test the end-to-end integration of the embeddings model
You can execute a query to test that the embedding model is configured successfully,
and embeddings are retrieved. For example, run the following query:
GoogleSQL
SELECT embeddings . values
FROM SAFE . ML . PREDICT (
MODEL MODEL_NAME ,
( SELECT description AS content FROM products LIMIT 10 )
);
Replace the following:
MODEL_NAME : the name of the Vertex AI text embedding model
PostgreSQL
SELECT spanner . ML_PREDICT_ROW (
'projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /publishers/google/models/ $MODEL_NAME ' ,
JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT ( 'instances' , JSONB_BUILD_ARRAY ( JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT ( 'content' , description ))))
FROM Products
LIMIT 10 ;
Replace the following:
PROJECT : the project hosting the Vertex AI endpoint
LOCATION : the location of the Vertex AI endpoint
MODEL_NAME : the name of the Vertex AI text embedding model
Update the source table to include additional columns to store the embeddings
Next, update the source table schema to include an additional column of the
data type ARRAY<FLOAT32> to store the generated embeddings:
GoogleSQL
ALTER TABLE TABLE_NAME
ADD COLUMN EMBEDDING_COLUMN_NAME ARRAY<FLOAT32> ;
Replace the following:
TABLE_NAME : the name of the source table
EMBEDDING_COLUMN_NAME : the name of the column in which you want to add generated embeddings
PostgreSQL
ALTER TABLE TABLE_NAME
ADD COLUMN EMBEDDING_COLUMN_NAME real [];
Replace the following:
TABLE_NAME : the name of the source table
EMBEDDING_COLUMN_NAME : the name of the column in which you want to add generated embeddings
For example, using the products table example, run:
GoogleSQL
ALTER TABLE Products
ADD COLUMN desc_embed ARRAY<FLOAT32> ;
PostgreSQL
ALTER TABLE Products
ADD COLUMN desc_embed real [];
You can add another column to manage the version of the embedding model.
GoogleSQL
ALTER TABLE Products
ADD COLUMN desc_embed_model_version INT64 ;
PostgreSQL
ALTER TABLE Products
ADD COLUMN desc_embed_model_version INT8 ;
Increase the quota for Vertex AI
You might need to increase the Vertex AI API quota for the
region which uses the text embedding model. To request an increase, see
Vertex AI Quota increases .
For more information, see Vertex AI quotas and limits .
Backfill embeddings
Finally, execute the following UPDATE statement using partitioned DML
to generate embeddings for the textual data column and store the embeddings
in your database. You can store the model version along with the embeddings. We
recommend that you execute this query during a low-traffic window in your
database.
GoogleSQL
UPDATE TABLE_NAME
SET
TABLE_NAME . EMBEDDING_COLUMN_NAME = (
SELECT embeddings . values
FROM SAFE . ML . PREDICT (
MODEL MODEL_NAME ,
( SELECT TABLE_NAME . DATA_COLUMN_NAME AS content )
) @{ remote_udf_max_rows_per_rpc = MAX_ROWS }
),
TABLE_NAME . EMBEDDING_VERSION_COLUMN = MODEL_VERSION
WHERE FILTER_CONDITION ;
Replace the following:
TABLE_NAME : the name of the table with the textual data
EMBEDDING_COLUMN_NAME : the name of the column in which you want to add generated embeddings
DATA_COLUMN_NAME : the name of the column with the textual data
MODEL_NAME : the name of the Vertex AI embedding model
MAX_ROWS : the maximum number of rows per RPC
EMBEDDING_VERSION_COLUMN : the column that manages the version of the embedding model used to backfill your embeddings
MODEL_VERSION : the version of the text embedding model
FILTER_CONDITION : a partitionable filter condition that you want to apply
Using SAFE.ML.PREDICT returns NULL for failed requests. You can also use
SAFE.ML.PREDICT in combination with a WHERE embedding_column IS NULL
filter to rerun your query without computing the embeddings for the fields
that are already computed.
PostgreSQL
UPDATE TABLE_NAME
SET
EMBEDDING_COLUMN_NAME = spanner . FLOAT32_ARRAY ( spanner . ML_PREDICT_ROW (
'projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /publishers/google/models/ $MODEL_NAME ' ,
JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT ( 'instances' , JSONB_BUILD_ARRAY ( JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT ( 'content' , DATA_COLUMN_NAME )))
) /*@ remote_udf_max_rows_per_rpc= MAX_ROWS */ - > 'predictions' - > 0 - > 'embeddings' - > 'values' ),
EMBEDDING_VERSION_COLUMN = MODEL_VERSION
WHERE FILTER_CONDITION ;
Replace the following:
TABLE_NAME : the name of the table with the textual data
EMBEDDING_COLUMN_NAME : the name of the column in which you want to add generated embeddings
DATA_COLUMN_NAME : the name of the column with the textual data
PROJECT : the project hosting the Vertex AI endpoint
LOCATION : the location of the Vertex AI endpoint
MODEL_NAME : the name of the Vertex AI embedding model
MODEL_VERSION : the version of the Vertex AI embedding model
MAX_ROWS : the maximum number of rows per RPC
EMBEDDING_VERSION_COLUMN : the column that manages the version of the text embedding model used to backfill your embeddings
FILTER_CONDITION : a partitionable filter condition that you want to apply
An example backfill query for the products table:
GoogleSQL
UPDATE products
SET
products . desc_embed = (
SELECT embeddings . values
FROM SAFE . ML . PREDICT (
MODEL embedding_model ,
( SELECT products . description AS content )
) @{ remote_udf_max_rows_per_rpc = 200 }
),
products . desc_embed_model_version = 3
WHERE products . desc_embed IS NULL ;
PostgreSQL
UPDATE products
SET
desc_embed = spanner . FLOAT32_ARRAY ( spanner . ML_PREDICT_ROW (
'projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /publishers/google/models/ $MODEL_NAME ' ,
JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT ( 'instances' , JSONB_BUILD_ARRAY ( JSONB_BUILD_OBJECT ( 'content' , description )))
) /*@ remote_udf_max_rows_per_rpc=200 */ - > 'predictions' - > 0 - > 'embeddings' - > 'values' ),
desc_embed_model_version = 3
WHERE desc_embed IS NULL ;
For best practices, consider the following:
The default gRPC timeout for the Spanner API is one hour.
Depending on the amount of embeddings you are backfilling, you might need to
increase this timeout to ensure that the UPDATE partitioned DML has
sufficient time to complete. For more information, see
Configure custom timeouts and retries .
Performance and other considerations
Consider the following to optimize performance when backfilling embedding
data.
Number of nodes
Partitioned DML executes the given DML statement on different partitions in
parallel. For instances with a high number of nodes, you might observe quota
errors during the execution of partitioned DML. If the Vertex AI
API requests are throttled due to Vertex AI API quota limits,
then Spanner retries these failures under the
partitioned DML transaction mode
for a maximum of 20 times. If you observe a high rate of quota errors in
Vertex AI, then increase the quota for Vertex AI .
You can also tune the parallelism using the statement-level hint
@{pdml_max_parallelism=DESIRED_NUMBER} while using GoogleSQL. The following
example sets the parallelism to '5':
GoogleSQL
@{ pdml_max_parallelism = 5 } UPDATE products
SET products . desc_embed = (
SELECT embeddings . values
FROM SAFE . ML . PREDICT ( MODEL embedding_model , (
SELECT products . value AS CONTENT
)
)
@{ remote_udf_max_rows_per_rpc = 200 }
),
products . desc_embed_model_version = MODEL_VERSION
WHERE products . desc_embed IS NULL ;
Size of text in the data column
The Vertex AI embedding model has limits on the maximum number of
tokens for each text input. Different model versions have different token
limits. Each Vertex AI request can have multiple input text
fields, but there is a limit on the maximum number of tokens which is present
in a single request. For GoogleSQL databases, if you encounter an
INVALID_ARGUMENT error with a "Request is too large" message, try reducing the
batch size to avoid the error. To do so, you can configure default_batch_size
or use the @{remote_udf_max_outstanding_rpcs} query hint when registering the model.
Number of API requests sent to Vertex AI
You can use the query hint @{remote_udf_max_outstanding_rpcs} to increase or
decrease the number of requests sent to Vertex AI from
Spanner. Be aware that increasing this limit can increase the CPU
and memory usage of the Spanner instance. For GoogleSQL
databases, using this query hint overrides the default_batch_size configured
for your model.
Monitor backfill progress
You can monitor the number of requests, latency, and network bytes sent to
Vertex AI from Spanner using the
system insights dashboard .
