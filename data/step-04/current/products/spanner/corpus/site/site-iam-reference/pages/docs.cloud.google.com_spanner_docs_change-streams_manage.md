Create and manage change streams
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create, modify, and view Spanner change
streams for GoogleSQL-dialect databases and PostgreSQL-dialect databases. To learn more about change streams,
see About change streams .
Because change streams are schema objects, you create and manage them
through the same DDL-driven schema
updates used for any other kind of
database-definition work, such as creating tables or adding indexes.
Spanner begins a long-running
operation after you
submit a schema-changing DDL statement, including those used to create,
alter, or delete change streams. A new or altered change stream
begins to watch the columns or tables specified by its new configuration
upon the completion of this long-running operation.
Create a change stream
To create a change stream, you need to provide its name and the schema objects
it watches: either the entire database, or a list of specific tables and
columns. You can optionally configure a change stream with any of the following:
Specify the data retention period to override the
default, one-day retention period.
Specify the value capture type to override the
default value capture type OLD_AND_NEW_VALUES .
Apply a TTL-based deletes filter to filter out TTL-based
deletes from your change streams.
Apply a table modifications filter to exclude all
INSERT , UPDATE , or DELETE table modifications.
Enable a transaction-level records exclusion to
exclude certain transactions from your change streams.
GoogleSQL
The DDL syntax for creating a change stream using GoogleSQL looks
like this:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME
[ FOR column_or_table_watching_definition [ , ... ] ]
[
OPTIONS (
retention_period = timespan ,
value_capture_type = type ,
exclude_ttl_deletes = boolean ,
exclude_insert = boolean ,
exclude_update = boolean ,
exclude_delete = boolean ,
allow_txn_exclusion = boolean
)
]
PostgreSQL
The DDL syntax for creating a change stream using PostgreSQL looks
like this:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME
[ FOR column_or_table_watching_definition [, ... ] ]
[
WITH (
retention_period = timespan ,
value_capture_type = type ,
exclude_ttl_deletes = boolean ,
exclude_insert = boolean ,
exclude_update = boolean ,
exclude_delete = boolean ,
allow_txn_exclusion = boolean
)
]
A new change stream begins to watch its assigned schema objects as soon
as the long-running operation that created it completes.
The following examples illustrate the creation of change streams with
various configurations.
Watch an entire database
To create a change stream that watches every data change performed
throughout a database's tables, use the ALL keyword:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM EverythingStream
FOR ALL ;
The ALL configuration implicitly
includes all of the database's future data
tables and columns, as soon as they get created. It
doesn't include views, information schema tables, or
other objects aside from normal data tables.
Watch specific tables
To limit a change stream's scope to specific tables, rather
than an entire database, specify a list of one or more
tables:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM SingerAlbumStream
FOR Singers , Albums ;
Spanner automatically updates change
streams that watch whole tables to reflect any schema changes affecting
those tables, such as added or dropped columns.
Watch specific columns
Use the table ( column_1 [, column_2 ,
...]) syntax to watch changes to one or more specific,
non-key columns within tables that you name:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NamesAndTitles
FOR Singers ( FirstName , LastName ), Albums ( Title );
You can't specify primary key columns here because every change stream
always tracks the primary keys of every table it watches. This allows
every data change record to identify the changed row by its primary key.
Watch tables and columns in a single stream
You can combine table-watching and column-watching syntax from the previous two
examples in a single change stream:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NamesAndAlbums
FOR Singers ( FirstName , LastName ), Albums ;
Specify a longer retention period
To specify a change stream data retention period
longer than the default of one day, set the retention_period to a period
of up to thirty days, expressed as either hours ( h ) or days ( d ).
Two examples:
GoogleSQL
CREATE CHANGE STREAM LongerDataRetention
FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( retention_period = '36h' );
CREATE CHANGE STREAM MaximumDataRetention
FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( retention_period = '7d' );
PostgreSQL
CREATE CHANGE STREAM LongerDataRetention
FOR ALL
WITH ( retention_period = '36h' );
CREATE CHANGE STREAM MaximumDataRetention
FOR ALL
WITH ( retention_period = '7d' );
Specify a different value capture type
To specify a change stream value capture type
other than OLD_AND_NEW_VALUES , set the value_capture_type to either
NEW_VALUES or NEW_ROW , as shown in the following examples:
GoogleSQL
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewRowChangeStream
FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( value_capture_type = 'NEW_ROW' );
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewValuesChangeStream
FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( value_capture_type = 'NEW_VALUES' );
PostgreSQL
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewRowChangeStream
FOR ALL
WITH ( value_capture_type = 'NEW_ROW' );
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewValuesChangeStream
FOR ALL
WITH ( value_capture_type = 'NEW_VALUES' );
Filter TTL-based deletes
You can filter TTL-based deletes
from your change stream's scope using the exclude_ttl_deletes filter.
For more information on how this filter work, see
Time to live based deletes filter .
GoogleSQL
To create a change stream with the TTL-based deletes filter, run the
following example:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( exclude_ttl_deletes = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your new
change stream
The following example creates a change stream called NewFilterChangeStream
that excludes all TTL-based deletes:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( exclude_ttl_deletes = true )
PostgreSQL
To create a change stream with the TTL-based deletes filter, run the
following example:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
WITH ( exclude_ttl_deletes = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your new change stream
The following example creates a change stream called NewFilterChangeStream
that excludes all TTL-based deletes:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream FOR ALL
WITH ( exclude_ttl_deletes = true )
To add or remove the TTL-based deletes filter from an existing
change stream, see Modify TTL-based deletes filter .
You can confirm your change stream filters by
viewing definitions of the change stream as DDL .
Filter by table modification type
Filter one or more of these table modifications from your
change stream's scope using the following available filter options:
exclude_insert : exclude all INSERT table modifications
exclude_update : exclude all UPDATE table modifications
exclude_delete : exclude all DELETE table modifications
For more information on how these filters work, see
Table modification type filters .
GoogleSQL
To create a change stream with one or more table modification type
filters, run the following:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your new
change stream
MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME : the filter you
want to add: exclude_insert , exclude_update , or exclude_delete .
If adding more than one filter at a time, separate each with a comma.
The following example creates a change stream called NewFilterChangeStream
that excludes the INSERT and UPDATE table modification types:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( exclude_insert = true , exclude_update = true )
PostgreSQL
To create a change stream with one or more table modification type
filters, run the following:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
WITH ( MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your new
change stream
MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME : the filter you
want to add: exclude_insert , exclude_update , or exclude_delete .
If adding more than one filter at a time, separate each with a comma.
The following example creates a change stream called NewFilterChangeStream
that excludes the INSERT and UPDATE table modification types:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream FOR ALL
WITH ( exclude_insert = true , exclude_update = true )
To add or remove a table modification type filter from an existing
change stream, see Modify filter by table modification type .
You can confirm which table modification type filters exist for your
change stream by
viewing definitions of the change stream as DDL .
Enable exclusion of transaction-level records
You can enable your change streams to exclude records from specified
write transactions by setting the allow_txn_exclusion option when you create a
change stream, or by modifying an existing change stream .
For more information on how this option works, see
Transaction-level records exclusion .
GoogleSQL
To create a change stream that can exclude records from specified
write transactions, run the following:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( allow_txn_exclusion = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of the new change stream
The following example creates a change stream named NewChangeStream
that can exclude records from specified write transactions:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewChangeStream FOR ALL
OPTIONS ( allow_txn_exclusion = true )
PostgreSQL
To create a change stream that can exclude records from specified
write transactions, run the following:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
WITH ( allow_txn_exclusion = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of the new change stream
The following example creates a change stream named NewChangeStream
that can exclude records from specified write transactions,:
CREATE CHANGE STREAM NewChangeStream FOR ALL
WITH ( allow_txn_exclusion = true )
To enable or disable the transaction-level records exclusion from an existing
change stream, see Modify transaction-level records exclusion .
To check the setting of this option, see
view definitions of change streams as DDL .
Specify a write transaction to be excluded from change streams
To specify a write transaction to be excluded from change streams, you must
set the exclude_txn_from_change_streams parameter to true . The following
code samples shows how you can specify a write transaction to be excluded from
change streams using the client library.
Go
import (
"context"
"fmt"
"io"
"cloud.google.com/go/spanner"
)
// readWriteTxnExcludedFromChangeStreams executes the insert and update DMLs on
// Singers table excluded from tracking change streams with ddl option
// allow_txn_exclusion = true.
func readWriteTxnExcludedFromChangeStreams ( w io . Writer , db string ) error {
// db = `projects/<project>/instances/<instance-id>/database/<database-id>`
ctx := context . Background ()
client , err := spanner . NewClient ( ctx , db )
if err != nil {
return fmt . Errorf ( "readWriteTxnExcludedFromChangeStreams.NewClient: %w" , err )
}
defer client . Close ()
_ , err = client . ReadWriteTransactionWithOptions ( ctx , func ( ctx context . Context , txn * spanner . ReadWriteTransaction ) error {
stmt := spanner . Statement {
SQL : `INSERT Singers (SingerId, FirstName, LastName)
VALUES (111, 'Virginia', 'Watson')` ,
}
_ , err := txn . Update ( ctx , stmt )
if err != nil {
return fmt . Errorf ( "readWriteTxnExcludedFromChangeStreams.Update: %w" , err )
}
fmt . Fprintln ( w , "New singer inserted." )
stmt = spanner . Statement {
SQL : `UPDATE Singers SET FirstName = 'Hi' WHERE SingerId = 111` ,
}
_ , err = txn . Update ( ctx , stmt )
if err != nil {
return fmt . Errorf ( "readWriteTxnExcludedFromChangeStreams.Update: %w" , err )
}
fmt . Fprint ( w , "Singer first name updated." )
return nil
}, spanner . TransactionOptions { ExcludeTxnFromChangeStreams : true })
if err != nil {
return err
}
return nil
}
Java
static void readWriteTxnExcludedFromChangeStreams ( DatabaseClient client ) {
// Exclude the transaction from allowed tracking change streams with alloww_txn_exclusion=true.
// This exclusion will be applied to all the individual operations inside this transaction.
client
. readWriteTransaction ( Options . excludeTxnFromChangeStreams ())
. run (
transaction - > {
transaction . executeUpdate (
Statement . of (
"INSERT Singers (SingerId, FirstName, LastName)\n"
+ "VALUES (1341, 'Virginia', 'Watson')" ));
System . out . println ( "New singer inserted." );
transaction . executeUpdate (
Statement . of ( "UPDATE Singers SET FirstName = 'Hi' WHERE SingerId = 111" ));
System . out . println ( "Singer first name updated." );
return null ;
});
}
Modify a change stream
To modify a change stream's configuration, use an ALTER CHANGE STREAM DDL
statement. It uses syntax similar to CREATE CHANGE STREAM . You can
change which columns a stream watches, or the length of its data
retention period. You can also suspend its watching altogether while
retaining its data change records.
Modify what a change stream watches
This example adds the entire Songs table to the NamesAndAlbums
change stream configured earlier:
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NamesAndAlbums
SET FOR Singers ( FirstName , LastName ), Albums , Songs ;
Spanner replaces the named change stream's behavior with
the new configuration upon the completion of the long-running operation
that updates the change stream's definition within the database's
schema.
Modify a change stream's data retention period
To modify the length of time that a change stream retains its internal
records, set the retention_period in an ALTER CHANGE STREAM DDL statement.
This example adjusts the data retention period to the NamesAndAlbums
change stream created previously:
GoogleSQL
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NamesAndAlbums
SET OPTIONS ( retention_period = '36h' );
PostgreSQL
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NamesAndAlbums
SET ( retention_period = '36h' );
Modify a change stream's value capture type
To modify the value capture type of a change stream, set the
value_capture_type clause in an ALTER CHANGE STREAM DDL statement.
This example adjusts the value capture type to NEW_VALUES .
GoogleSQL
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NamesAndAlbums
SET OPTIONS ( value_capture_type = 'NEW_VALUES' );
PostgreSQL
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NamesAndAlbums
SET ( value_capture_type = 'NEW_VALUES' );
Note: Modifying the value capture type of a change stream doesn't cause
columns to backfill. For example, modifying the value capture type from
NEW_VALUES to OLD_AND_NEW_VALUES doesn't cause backfill of old values
for a change stream.
Modify TTL-based deletes filter
To modify the TTL-based deletes filter for a change
stream, set the exclude_ttl_deletes filter in an ALTER CHANGE STREAM DDL
statement. You can use this to add the filter to or remove the filter from
your existing change streams.
For more information on how these filters work, see
Time to live based deletes filter .
Add the TTL-based deletes filter to an existing change stream
GoogleSQL
To add the TTL-based deletes filter to an existing change stream,
run the following to set the filter to true :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
SET OPTIONS ( exclude_ttl_deletes = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your existing
change stream
In the following example, the exclude_ttl_deletes filter is added to an
existing change stream called NewFilterChangeStream that excludes all
TTL-based deletes:
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream FOR ALL
SET OPTIONS ( exclude_ttl_deletes = true )
This excludes all future TTL-based deletes from the change stream.
PostgreSQL
To add the TTL-based deletes filter to an existing change stream,
run the following to set the filter to true :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
SET ( exclude_ttl_deletes = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your existing
change stream
In the following example, the exclude_ttl_deletes filter is added to an
existing change stream called NewFilterChangeStream that excludes all
TTL-based deletes:
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream FOR ALL
SET ( exclude_ttl_deletes = true )
This excludes all future TTL-based deletes from the change stream.
Remove the TTL-based deletes filter from an existing change stream
GoogleSQL
To remove the TTL-based deletes filter to an existing change stream,
run the following to set the filter to false :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
SET OPTIONS ( exclude_ttl_deletes = false )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your new
change stream
In the following example, the exclude_ttl_deletes filter is removed from an
existing change stream called NewFilterChangeStream :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream FOR ALL
SET OPTIONS ( exclude_ttl_deletes = false )
This includes all future TTL-based deletes to the change stream.
You can also set the filter to null to remove the TTL-based deletes filter.
PostgreSQL
To remove the TTL-based deletes filter to an existing change stream,
run the following to set the filter to false :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
SET ( exclude_ttl_deletes = false )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your new
change stream
In the following example, the exclude_ttl_deletes filter is removed from an
existing change stream called NewFilterChangeStream :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream FOR ALL
SET ( exclude_ttl_deletes = false )
This includes all future TTL-based deletes to the change stream.
You can also set the filter to null to remove the TTL-based deletes filter.
Modify filter by table modification type
To modify the table modification type filters for a change stream,
set the filter type in an ALTER CHANGE STREAM DDL statement. You can use this
to add a new filter to or remove an existing filter from your change stream.
Add a table modification type filter to an existing change stream
GoogleSQL
To add one or more new table modification type filters to an existing
change stream, run the following to set the filter to true :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME
SET OPTIONS ( MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : replace with the name of your
existing change stream
MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME : replace with the filter you
want to add: exclude_insert , exclude_update , or exclude_delete .
If adding more than one filter at a time, separate each filter with a
comma.
In the following example, the exclude_delete filter is added to an
existing change stream called NewFilterChangeStream :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream
SET OPTIONS ( exclude_delete = true )
PostgreSQL
To add one or more new table modification type filters to an existing
change stream, run the following to set the filter to true :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME
SET ( MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : replace with the name of your
existing change stream
MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME : replace with the filter you
want to add: exclude_insert , exclude_update , or exclude_delete .

To remove one or more existing table modification type filters in
change stream, run the following to set the filter to false :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME
SET OPTIONS ( MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME = false )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : replace with the name of your
existing change stream
MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME : replace with the filter you
want to remove: exclude_insert , exclude_update , or exclude_delete .
If removing more than one filter at a time, separate each with a comma.
In the following example, the exclude_delete filter is removed from an
existing change stream called NewFilterChangeStream :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream
SET OPTIONS ( exclude_delete = false )
You can also remove a table modification filter by setting the filter
back to default value. To do this, set the filter value to null .
PostgreSQL
To remove one or more existing table modification type filters in
change stream, run the following to set the filter to false :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME
SET ( MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME = false )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : replace with the name of your
existing change stream
MOD_TYPE_FILTER_NAME : replace with the filter you
want to remove: exclude_insert , exclude_update , or exclude_delete .
If removing more than one filter at a time, separate each with a comma.
In the following example, the exclude_delete filter is removed from an
existing change stream called NewFilterChangeStream :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream
SET ( exclude_delete = false )
You can also remove a table modification filter by setting the filter
back to default value. To do this, set the filter value to null .
Modify change stream to allow exclusion of transaction-level records
You can modify your change stream to allow it to exclude records from
specified write transactions. To do this, set the allow_txn_exclusion option
to true in an ALTER CHANGE STREAM DDL statement. If you don't set this
option, or if you set it to false , then the change stream watches all write
transactions.
For more information about how this option works, see
Transaction-level records exclusion .
Enable transaction-level records exclusion for an existing change stream
GoogleSQL
To enable transaction-level records exclusion for an existing change stream,
run the following:
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
SET OPTIONS ( allow_txn_exclusion = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your existing
change stream
In the following example, the allow_txn_exclusion option is enabled on an
existing change stream, NewAllowedChangeStream :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewAllowedChangeStream FOR ALL
SET OPTIONS ( allow_txn_exclusion = true )
This allows the change stream to exclude records from specified write
transactions.
PostgreSQL
To enable transaction-level records exclusion for an existing change stream,
run the following:
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
SET ( allow_txn_exclusion = true )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your existing
change stream
In the following example, the allow_txn_exclusion option is enabled on an
existing change stream, NewAllowedChangeStream :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewAllowedChangeStream FOR ALL
SET ( allow_txn_exclusion = true )
This allows the change stream to exclude records from specified write
transactions.
Disable transaction-level records exclusion for an existing change stream
GoogleSQL
To disable the transaction-level records exclusion on an existing change
stream, run the following:
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
SET OPTIONS ( allow_txn_exclusion = false )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your change stream
In the following example, the allow_txn_exclusion option is disabled on an
existing change stream called NewAllowedChangeStream :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewFilterChangeStream FOR ALL
SET OPTIONS ( allow_txn_exclusion = false )
The change stream watches all write transactions.
PostgreSQL
To disable the transaction-level records exclusion on an existing change
stream, run the following:
ALTER CHANGE STREAM CHANGE_STREAM_NAME FOR ALL
SET ( allow_txn_exclusion = false )
Replace the following:
CHANGE_STREAM_NAME : the name of your change stream
In the following example, the allow_txn_exclusion option is disabled on an
existing change stream called NewAllowedChangeStream :
ALTER CHANGE STREAM NewAllowedChangeStream FOR ALL
SET ( allow_txn_exclusion = false )
The change stream watches all write transactions.
Suspend a change stream
If you want to have a change stream halt its activity but retain its
internal records—at least for the life of its data retention period—you
can alter it so that it watches nothing.
To do this, issue an ALTER CHANGE STREAM DDL statement that replaces
the change stream's definition with the special phrase DROP FOR ALL .
For example:
ALTER CHANGE STREAM MyStream DROP FOR ALL ;
The stream continues to exist in the database, but watches no objects,
and generates no further data change records. Its existing change
records remain intact, subject to the stream's data retention policy.
To resume a suspended stream, issue another ALTER CHANGE STREAM
statement with its previous configuration.
Note: You can create a change stream in a suspended state by omitting the FOR
clause entirely from the DDL: CREATE CHANGE STREAM MyStream; .
Delete a change stream
To permanently delete a change stream, issue a DROP CHANGE STREAM
statement that includes the stream's name:
DROP CHANGE STREAM NamesAndAlbums ;
Spanner immediately stops the stream, removes it from the
database's schema, and deletes its data change records.
List and view change streams
The Google Cloud console provides a web interface for listing and
reviewing a database's change stream definitions. You can also view the
structure of change streams as their equivalent DDL statements, or by
querying the information schema for the database.
View change streams with Google Cloud console
To see a list of a database's change streams and review their definitions:
Visit the Spanner instances page of the
Google Cloud console.
Open the instances page
Navigate to the appropriate instance and database.
Click Change streams in the navigational menu.
This displays a list of all of that database's change streams, and
summarizes the configuration of each one. Clicking a stream's name
reveals further details about the tables and columns that it watches.
View definitions of change streams as DDL
Viewing a database's schema as DDL includes descriptions of all its
change streams, where they appear as CREATE CHANGE STREAM statements.
To do this from the console, click The Show equivalent DDL link on
the database's page in the Google Cloud console.
To do this from the command line, use the ddl describe command of
Google Cloud CLI .
Query the information schema about change streams
You can directly query a database's information
schema about its change streams. The
following tables contain the metadata that defines change streams'
names, the tables and columns that they watch, and their retention
periods:
information_schema.change_streams
information_schema.change_stream_tables
information_schema.change_stream_columns
information_schema.change_stream_options
Change streams best practices
The following are some best practices for configuring and managing change
streams.
Consider a separate metadata database
Change streams use a metadata database to maintain internal state.
The metadata database can be the same as or different from the database that
contains the change streams. We recommend creating a separate database for
metadata storage.
The Spanner change streams connector needs read-write
permissions to the metadata database. You don't need to prepare this
database with a schema; the connector takes care of that.
Using a separate metadata database eliminates complexities that might arise
from allowing the connector to write directly to your application database:
By separating the metadata database from
the production database with the change stream, the connector needs only
read permissions to the production database.
By restricting the traffic of the connector to a separate metadata
database, writes performed by the connector itself are not included
in the production change streams. This is especially relevant for change streams
that watch the entire database.
If no separate database is being used to store the metadata, we recommend
monitoring the CPU impact of the change streams connector on their instances.
Benchmark new change streams and resize if needed
Before adding new change streams to your production instance, consider
benchmarking a realistic workload on a staging instance with change
streams enabled. This lets you determine whether you need to add nodes
to your instance, in order to increase its compute and storage
capacities.
Run these tests until CPU and storage metrics stabilize. Optimally, the
instance's CPU utilization should remain under
the recommended maximums , and
its storage usage shouldn't exceed the instance's storage limit.
Use different regions to load-balance
When using change streams in a
multi-region instance configuration ,
consider running
their processing pipelines in a different region than the default leader
region. This helps to spread the streaming load among non-leader replicas. If
you need to prioritize the lowest possible streaming delay over
load balancing, however, run the streaming load in the leader region.
What's next
Build change streams pipelines with Dataflow .
Use templates
to rapidly connect a change stream to BigQuery, Cloud Storage,
or Pub/Sub.
