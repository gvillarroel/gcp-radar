— Remote Functions in Spanner
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
A Spanner remote function lets you implement your function in languages
other than SQL. Functions must be hosted in
Cloud Run functions or
Cloud Run . Hosting functions in
this manner allows complex business logic to be split out into separate remote
functions.
A typical remote function deployment has the following steps:
Create an HTTPS endpoint in Cloud Run functions or
Cloud Run.
If you are new to remote functions, we recommend using
Cloud Run functions.
Create a remote function in Spanner
pointing to that HTTPS endpoint.
Use the remote function in a query.
Required roles
To ensure that your Spanner agent service account (service- PROJECT_ID @gcp-sa-spanner.iam.gserviceaccount.com) has the necessary
permissions to use Spanner remote functions,
ask your administrator to grant the
Spanner API Service Agent ( roles/spanner.serviceAgent )
IAM role to your Spanner agent service account (service- PROJECT_ID @gcp-sa-spanner.iam.gserviceaccount.com) on the project.
Important: You must grant this role
to your Spanner agent service account (service- PROJECT_ID @gcp-sa-spanner.iam.gserviceaccount.com), not to your user account. Failure to grant the role to the correct principal might result in permission errors.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Your administrator might also be able to give your Spanner agent service account (service- PROJECT_ID @gcp-sa-spanner.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Supported types
Remote functions support the following data types as argument or return types:
ARRAY (of any of the following supported types)
BOOLEAN
BYTES
DATE
JSON
INTEGER
NUMERIC
STRING
TIMESTAMP
Limitations
You cannot create table-valued remote functions.
Remote functions are not supported in generated column expressions.
You might see repeated requests with the same data to your endpoint,
sometimes even after successful responses, due to transient network errors
or Spanner internal restarts.
Running remote functions in fractional Spanner instances is not
supported.
Remote functions are not supported for Cloud Run functions
behind custom domains.
Remote functions are not supported in PostgreSQL dialect.
Create an endpoint
The business logic must be implemented as a Cloud Run function
or Cloud Run. The endpoint must be able to process a batch of
rows in a single HTTPS POST request and return the result for the batch as an
HTTPS response.
If you have created remote functions for
BigQuery , you can reuse them for
Spanner.
See the Cloud Run functions tutorial and
other Cloud Run functions documentation on
how to write, deploy, test and maintain a Cloud Run function.
See the Cloud Run quick
start and other
Cloud Run documentation on how to write,
deploy, test and maintain a Cloud Run service.
We recommend maintaining the default authentication for your
Cloud Run function or Cloud Run service. Avoid configuring
the service to allow unauthenticated invocation.
Input format
Spanner sends HTTPS POST requests with JSON bodies in the following
format:
Field name
Description
Field type
requestId
Request identifier. Unique over multiple requests sent to the endpoint in
a GoogleSQL query.
Always provided. String.
calls
A batch of input data.
Always provided. A JSON array.
Each element is a JSON array that represents a JSON-encoded argument list for a single remote function call.
An example of a request:
// Sample request to a Cloud Run functions to calculate sum of two numbers. This request
// has two calls batched together into a single request.
{
"requestId" : "124ab1c" ,
"calls" : [
[ 1 , 2 ],
[ 3 , 4 ]
]
}
Output format
Spanner expects the endpoint to return an HTTPS response in the
following format; otherwise, Spanner can't consume the response
and the query fails calling the remote function.
Field name
Description
Value Range
replies
A batch of return values.
JSON array.
Each element corresponds to a JSON encoded return value of the external function.
Size of the array must match the size of the JSON array of calls in the HTTPS request. For example, if the JSON array in calls has 4 elements, this JSON array needs to have 4 elements as well. Required for a successful response.
errorMessage
Error message when the HTTPS response code other than 200 is returned. For
non-retryable errors, Spanner returns this error message to the user. Required in failed responses. Typically less than 1 KB.
String.
An example of a successful response:
// Sample response from the Cloud Run functions which has the sum of the two numbers. Note
// that the order of the values within `replies` field matches the `calls` field from
// the request.
{
"replies" : [
3 , // 1 + 2 = 3
7 // 3 + 4 = 7
]
}
An example of a failed response:
{
// The error message returned by your Cloud Run functions to indicate an error.
// In this sample, the error message states that an overflow occurred when summing two numbers.
"errorMessage" : "Overflow detected when calculating sum of two numbers."
}
HTTPS response code
Your endpoint returns a 200 HTTPS code for a successful response. When
Spanner receives any other value, it considers the response a failure,
and retries when the HTTPS response code is 408, 429, 500, 503 or 504 until an
internal limit is met.
Sample code
Cloud Run function
The following sample Python code implements adding all the integer arguments
of the remote function. It handles a request with the arguments for batched
invocations and returns all the results in a response.
"""
Python script which uses Flask framework to spin up a HTTP server to take
integers and return their sum. In case of overflow, it returns the error
as part of the response.
"""
import functions_framework
from flask import jsonify
# Max INT64 value encoded as a number in JSON by TO_JSON_STRING. Larger values are encoded as
# strings.
_MAX_LOSSLESS = 9007199254740992
@functions_framework . http
def batch_add ( request ):
try :
return_value = []
request_json = request . get_json ()
calls = request_json [ 'calls' ]
for call in calls :
return_value . append ( sum ([ int ( x ) if isinstance ( x , str ) else x for x in call if x is not None ]))
replies = [ str ( x ) if x > _MAX_LOSSLESS or x < - _MAX_LOSSLESS else x for x in return_value ]
return_json = jsonify ( { "replies" : replies } )
return return_json
except Exception as e :
return jsonify ( { "errorMessage" : str ( e ) } ), 400
Assuming that the function is deployed in the project PROJECT_ID
in region us-east1 as the function name remote_add , it can
be accessed using the endpoint
https://us-east1- PROJECT_ID .cloudfunctions.net/remote_add .
Cloud Run
The following sample Python code implements a web service, which can be
built and deployed to Cloud Run for the same functionality.
"""
Python script which uses Flask framework to spin up a HTTP server to take
integers and return their sum. In case of overflow, it returns the error
as part of the response.
"""
import os
from flask import Flask , request , jsonify
# Max INT64 value encoded as a number in JSON by TO_JSON_STRING. Larger values are encoded as
# strings.
_MAX_LOSSLESS = 9007199254740992
app = Flask ( __name__ )
@app . route ( "/" , methods = [ 'POST' ])
def batch_add ():
try :
return_value = []
request_json = request . get_json ()
calls = request_json [ 'calls' ]
for call in calls :
return_value . append ( sum ([ int ( x ) if isinstance ( x , str ) else x for x in call if x is not None ]))
replies = [ str ( x ) if x > _MAX_LOSSLESS or x < - _MAX_LOSSLESS else x for x in return_value ]
return jsonify ( { "replies" : replies } )
except Exception as e :
return jsonify ( { "errorMessage" : str ( e ) } ), 400
if __name__ == "__main__" :
app . run ( debug = True , host = "0.0.0.0" , port = int ( os . environ . get ( "PORT" , 8080 )))
To build and deploy the code, see Quickstart: Build and deploy a Python
(Flask) web app to Cloud
Run .
Assuming that the Cloud Run service is deployed in the
project PROJECT_ID in region us-east1 as the
service name remote_add , it can be accessed using the endpoint
https://remote_add-<project_id_hash>-ue.a.run.app .
Create a remote function
To create a remote function:
SQL
Run the following CREATE FUNCTION statement in Spanner:
CREATE FUNCTION REMOTE_FUNCTION_NAME ( x INT64 , y INT64 ) RETURNS INT64 NOT DETERMINISTIC LANGUAGE REMOTE OPTIONS (
endpoint = ` ENDPOINT_URL ` ,
max_batching_rows = MAX_BATCHING_ROWS
);
Replace the following:
REMOTE_FUNCTION_NAME : the name of your remote function. For example,
sum_func .
ENDPOINT_URL : the Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run
endpoint created in the prior step.
MAX_BATCHING_ROWS (optional): the maximum number of rows to be sent as
part of a request. If not specified, Spanner determines the
batch size automatically.
Use remote function in a query
To call the remote function from the previous step within a query, use the
following example:
SELECT REMOTE_FUNCTION_NAME ( 1 , 2 ); -- 1 + 2 = 3
Pricing
Standard Spanner
pricing applies.
Spanner bills for bytes sent to and received from
Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run.
This feature may incur costs from Cloud Run functions and
Cloud Run. Review the
Cloud Run functions and
Cloud Run pricing
pages for details.
