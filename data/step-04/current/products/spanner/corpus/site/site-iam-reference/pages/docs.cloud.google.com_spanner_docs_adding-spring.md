Integrate Spanner with Spring Data
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
PostgreSQL interface note:
The PostgreSQL interface for Spanner doesn't
support Spring Data Spanner. You can use
Spring Data JPA instead.
The Spring Data Spanner module helps you use Spanner in any Java
application that's built with the
Spring Framework .
Like all Spring Data modules,
Spring Data Spanner provides a Spring-based programming model that
retains the consistency guarantees and scalability of Spanner. Its
features are similar to Spring Data JPA and
Hibernate ORM , with annotations designed for
Spanner. For more information about how to use
Spring Data JPA with Spanner, see
Integrate Spanner with Spring Data JPA (GoogleSQL dialect) .
If you're already familiar with Spring, then Spring Data Spanner can
make it easier to work with Spanner in your application and
reduce the amount of code that you need to write.
This page explains how to add Spring Data Spanner to a Java
application. For detailed information about the module, see the
Spring Data Spanner reference .
Install the module
If you use Maven, add the Spring Cloud GCP Bill of
Materials (BOM)
and Spring Data Spanner to your pom.xml file. These dependencies
provide the Spring Data Spanner components to your Spring
ApplicationContext :
<dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-dependencies</artifactId>
<version>3.7.7</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
<version>${spring.boot.version}</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-data-spanner</artifactId>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
You must also create a service account
and use the service account key to authenticate with Google Cloud.
For more information, see the instructions for
setting up a Java development environment . You do not need
to install the Google Cloud Client Library for Java; the Spring Boot starter
installs the client library automatically.
Configure the module
This section describes some of the most commonly used configuration settings for
Spring Data Spanner. For a complete list of settings, see the
reference documentation .
Specify an instance and database
To specify the default instance and database, set the following configuration
properties for your application:
Property
Description
spring.cloud.gcp.spanner.project-id
Optional. The Google Cloud project ID. Overrides the value of spring.cloud.gcp.config.project-id .
spring.cloud.gcp.spanner.instance-id
The Spanner instance ID.
spring.cloud.gcp.spanner.database
The database to connect to.
Model Spanner data
With Spring Data Spanner, you can use plain old Java objects (POJOs) to
model the data you store in your Spanner tables.
For each table in your database, declare an entity that represents a record in
that table. Use annotations to map the entity and its properties to a table and
its columns.
You can use the following annotations to model simple relationships between
entities and tables:
Entity annotations
@Column(name = " columnName ")
Optional. Maps the property to a specific column in the
Spanner table, overriding the naming strategy that
automatically maps the names.
When you omit this property, the default naming strategy for
Spring Data Spanner maps Java camelCase property
names to PascalCase column names. For example, the
property singerId maps to the column name
SingerId .
@Embedded
Indicates that the property is an embedded object that can hold
components of a primary key. If the property is actually used in the
primary key, you must also include the @PrimaryKey
annotation.
@Interleaved
@Interleaved(lazy = true )
Indicates that a property contains a list of rows that are
interleaved
with the current row.
By default, Spring Data Spanner fetches the interleaved rows
at instance creation. To fetch the rows lazily, when you access the
property, use @Interleaved(lazy = true) .
Example: If a Singer entity can have interleaved
Album entries as children, add a
List<Album> property to the Singer
entity. Also, add an @Interleaved annotation to the
property.
@NotMapped
Indicates that a property is not stored in the database and should be
ignored.
@PrimaryKey
@PrimaryKey(keyOrder = N )
Indicates that the property is a component of the primary key, and
identifies the position of the property within the primary key,
starting at 1. The default keyOrder is 1 .
Example: @PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 3)
@Table(name = " TABLE_NAME ")
The table that the entity models. Each instance of the entity
represents a record in the table. Replace
TABLE_NAME with the name of your table.
Example: @Table(name = "Singers")
If you need to model more complex relationships, see the
Spring Data Spanner reference
for details about other annotations that the module supports.
The following examples show one way to model the Singers and Albums tables
for Spring Data Spanner:
For Singer entities, the example includes an albums property, with an
@Interleaved annotation. This property contains a list of albums that are
interleaved with the Singer entity. Spring Data Spanner populates
this property automatically.
For Album entities, the example includes a relatedAlbums property that is
not stored in Spanner.

}
Query and modify data
To query and modify data with Spring Data Spanner, you can acquire a
SpannerTemplate bean, which implements
SpannerOperations . SpannerTemplate
provides methods for performing SQL queries and modifying data
with Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements . You can also use
this bean to access the read API and mutation
API for Spanner.
In addition, you can extend the
SpannerRepository interface to encapsulate
all of the application logic that queries and modifies data in Spanner.
The following sections explain how to work with SpannerTemplate and
SpannerRepository .
Acquire a template bean
Use the @Autowired annotation to acquire a SpannerTemplate bean
automatically. You can then use the SpannerTemplate throughout your class.
The following example shows a class that acquires and uses the bean:
import com.google.cloud.spanner. KeySet ;
import com.google.cloud.spanner. Statement ;
import com.google.cloud.spring.data.spanner.core.SpannerQueryOptions ;
import com.google.cloud.spring.data.spanner.core.SpannerTemplate ;
import java.util.List ;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired ;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component ;
/**
* A quick start code for Spring Data Cloud Spanner. It demonstrates how to use SpannerTemplate to
* execute DML and SQL queries, save POJOs, and read entities.
*/
@Component
public class SpannerTemplateSample {
@Autowired
SpannerTemplate spannerTemplate ;
public void runTemplateExample ( Singer singer ) {
// Delete all of the rows in the Singer table.
this . spannerTemplate . delete ( Singer . class , KeySet . all ());
// Insert a singer into the Singers table.
this . spannerTemplate . insert ( singer );
// Read all of the singers in the Singers table.
List<Singer> allSingers = this . spannerTemplate
. query ( Singer . class , Statement . of ( "SELECT * FROM Singers" ),
new SpannerQueryOptions (). setAllowPartialRead ( true ));
}
}
You can use the SpannerTemplate bean to execute read-only
transactions and read-write
transactions . In addition, you can use the
@Transactional annotation to create declarative
transactions.
Acquire a repository bean
If you use a SpannerRepository , you can use the @Autowired annotation to
acquire a bean that implements your repository's interface. A repository
includes methods for running Java functions as read-only
transactions and read-write
transactions . For lower-level operations, you can
get the template bean that the repository uses.
The following examples show the interface for a repository and a class that
acquires and uses the bean:
import com.google.cloud.spanner. Key ;
import com.google.cloud.spring.data.spanner.repository.SpannerRepository ;
import com.google.cloud.spring.data.spanner.repository.query.Query ;
import java.util.List ;
import org.springframework.data.repository.query.Param ;
/**
* An interface of various Query Methods. The behavior of the queries is defined only by
* their names, arguments, or annotated SQL strings. The implementation of these functions
* is generated by Spring Data Cloud Spanner.
*/
public interface SingerRepository extends SpannerRepository<Singer , Key > {
List<Singer> findByLastName ( String lastName );
int countByFirstName ( String firstName );
int deleteByLastName ( String lastName );
List<Singer> findTop3DistinctByFirstNameAndSingerIdIgnoreCaseOrLastNameOrderByLastNameDesc (
String firstName , String lastName , long singerId );
@Query ( "SELECT * FROM Singers WHERE firstName LIKE '%@fragment';" )
List<Singer> getByQuery ( @Param ( "fragment" ) String firstNameFragment );
}
import java.util.List ;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired ;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component ;
/**
* A quick start code for Spring Data Cloud Spanner.
* It demonstrates how to use a SpannerRepository to execute read-write queries
* generated from interface definitions.
*
*/
@Component
public class SpannerRepositorySample {
@Autowired
SingerRepository singerRepository ;
public void runRepositoryExample () {
List<Singer> lastNameSingers = this . singerRepository . findByLastName ( "a last name" );
int fistNameCount = this . singerRepository . countByFirstName ( "a first name" );
int deletedLastNameCount = this . singerRepository . deleteByLastName ( "a last name" );
}
}
Manage Spanner
To get information about your Spanner databases, update a schema with a
Data Definition Language (DDL) statement, or complete other administrative
tasks, you can acquire a
SpannerDatabaseAdminTemplate
bean.
Use the @Autowired annotation to acquire the bean automatically. You can then
use the SpannerDatabaseAdminTemplate throughout your class.
The following example shows a class that acquires and uses the bean:
import com.google.cloud.spring.data.spanner.core.admin.SpannerDatabaseAdminTemplate ;
import com.google.cloud.spring.data.spanner.core.admin.SpannerSchemaUtils ;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired ;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component ;
/**
* This sample demonstrates how to generate schemas for interleaved tables from POJOs and how to
* execute DDL.
*/
@Component
public class SpannerSchemaToolsSample {
@Autowired
SpannerDatabaseAdminTemplate spannerDatabaseAdminTemplate ;
@Autowired
SpannerSchemaUtils spannerSchemaUtils ;
/**
* Creates the Singers table. Also creates the Albums table, because Albums is interleaved with
* Singers.
*/
public void createTableIfNotExists () {
if ( ! this . spannerDatabaseAdminTemplate . tableExists ( "Singers" )) {
this . spannerDatabaseAdminTemplate . executeDdlStrings (
this . spannerSchemaUtils
. getCreateTableDdlStringsForInterleavedHierarchy ( Singer . class ),
true );
}
}
/**
* Drops both the Singers and Albums tables using just a reference to the Singer entity type ,
* because they are interleaved.
*/
public void dropTables () {
if ( this . spannerDatabaseAdminTemplate . tableExists ( "Singers" )) {
this . spannerDatabaseAdminTemplate . executeDdlStrings (
this . spannerSchemaUtils . getDropTableDdlStringsForInterleavedHierarchy ( Singer . class ),
false );
}
}
}
