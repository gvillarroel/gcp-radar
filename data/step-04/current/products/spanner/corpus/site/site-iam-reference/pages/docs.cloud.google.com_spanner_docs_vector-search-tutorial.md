This tutorial demonstrates how to build a generative AI application using
Spanner and Vertex AI .
This application lets you perform semantic similarity search, enabling you to
find products that match a natural language query. It achieves this by using
embeddings, which are numerical representations of text that capture the meaning
and context of words. You'll use a Vertex AI model to generate these
embeddings, and then store and search the embeddings in Spanner.
This approach is particularly useful for use cases like product search, where
users might describe what they want in natural language instead of specific
keywords.
The following topics help you learn how to:
Create an Google Cloud project
Create a Spanner instance
Create a database
Create an embedding model
Load data into Spanner
Generate embeddings for data
Perform KNN vector similarity search
Scale vector search with a vector index
Clean up resources

Create an instance
When you first use Spanner, you must create an instance ,
which is an allocation of resources that are used by Spanner
databases. This section shows you how to create an instance using
the Google Cloud console.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Spanner page.
Go to Spanner
Select or create a Google Cloud project if you haven't done so already.
Do one of the following:
If you haven't created a Spanner instance before, on the
Welcome to Spanner page, click
Create a provisioned instance .
If you've created a Spanner instance, on the Instances
page, click Create instance .
On the Select an edition page, select Enterprise Plus or
Enterprise .
Spanner vector search is available only in the
Enterprise edition or Enterprise Plus edition. To
compare the different editions, click Compare editions . For more
information, see the Spanner editions overview .
Click Continue .
In Instance name , enter an instance name, for example,
test-instance .
In Instance ID keep or change the instance ID. Your instance ID defaults
to your instance name, but you can change it. Your instance name and
instance ID can be the same or they can be different.
Click Continue .
In Choose a configuration , do the following:
Keep Regional selected.
In Select a configuration , select a region. The region you select is
where your instances are stored and replicated.

In Select unit , select Processing units (PUs) .
In Choose a scaling mode , keep Manual allocation selected and
in Quantity keep 1000 processing units.
Click Create .
The Google Cloud console displays the Overview page for the
instance you created.
Create a database
After your instance starts running, you can create your database. You define
your schema in the database .
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Spanner Instances
page.
Go to Spanner instances
Click the instance you created, for example, test-instance .
In Overview , under the name of your instance, click Create
database .
In Database name , enter a database name. For example, example-db .
In Select database dialect , choose Google Standard SQL.
Spanner vector search isn't available in the
PostgreSQL dialect.
Copy and paste the following schema into the DDL Templates editor tab.
The schema defines a Products table.
CREATE TABLE products (
categoryId INT64 NOT NULL ,
productId INT64 NOT NULL ,
productName STRING ( MAX ) NOT NULL ,
productDescription STRING ( MAX ) NOT NULL ,
productDescriptionEmbedding ARRAY<FLOAT32> ,
createTime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL OPTIONS (
allow_commit_timestamp = true
), inventoryCount INT64 NOT NULL ,
priceInCents INT64 ,
) PRIMARY KEY ( categoryId , productId );
Don't make any changes in Show encryption options .
Click Create . Google Cloud console displays the Overview page
for the database you created.
Create an embedding model
When you use the CREATE MODEL
DDL statement in Spanner, you are registering a reference to the
Vertex AI model's endpoint from your database. After you register
the model, you can use the ML.PREDICT
function to access the model in your queries.
The following example demonstrates how to register a Vertex AI
text embedding model ,
which is then used to perform similarity search to find similar products in a
database.
Note: The following schema uses the us-central1 Vertex AI
endpoint. Change this in the EmbeddingsModel definition if you chose a
different Spanner region when creating the instance.
In the database Overview page, click Spanner Studio .
In the Spanner Studio page, click
add New tab or use the empty
editor tab.
Enter:
CREATE MODEL EmbeddingsModel INPUT (
content STRING ( MAX ),
) OUTPUT (
embeddings STRUCT<values ARRAY<FLOAT32> > ,
) REMOTE OPTIONS (
endpoint = '//aiplatform.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/ TEXT_EMBEDDING_MODEL '
);
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : a permanent identifier that is unique for your
Google Cloud project.
TEXT_EMBEDDING_MODEL : the name of the text embedding model.
For a list of the Vertex AI text embedding models, see Supported models .
Click Run to create the model.
After the model is added successfully, you'll see it displayed in the
Explorer pane.
Load data
To load the Cymbal sample data into the products table, do the following:
In a new tab in Spanner Studio , copy and paste the following insert

Click Run to insert the data.
Generate vector embeddings
After you register a model and load data into Spanner, you can
generate vector embeddings with the product descriptions from your data.
Vector embeddings transform text data into a numerical value that captures the
meaning and context of words. This transformation is crucial for performing a
semantic search.
In this step, you'll populate the productDescriptionEmbedding column
by generating embeddings from the productDescription column using
ML.PREDICT . This lets you perform a vector similarity search in the next step.
In a new tab in Spanner Studio , copy and paste the following update
statement:
UPDATE products p1
SET productDescriptionEmbedding =
( SELECT embeddings . values
FROM ML . PREDICT ( MODEL EmbeddingsModel ,
( SELECT p1 . productDescription as content )
)
)
WHERE categoryId = 1 ;
Click Run to generate the embeddings.
Perform vector similarity search
In the following example, you provide a natural language search request using a
SQL query. The SQL query performs a vector similarity search using the vector
embeddings you generated previously. The query performs the search by doing the
following:
Uses ML.PREDICT to generate an embedding for the given search query ("I'd
like to buy a starter bike for my 3 year old child").
Calculates the COSINE_DISTANCE
between this query embedding and the productDescriptionEmbedding of each
product in the products table to find similar results in your
Cymbal store.
Filters the results to only include products with an inventoryCount
greater than 0.
Orders the results by the calculated distance and returns the top five
closest matches, along with the productName , productDescription , and
inventoryCount .
In a new tab in Spanner Studio , copy and paste the following query:
SELECT productName , productDescription , inventoryCount ,
COSINE_DISTANCE (
productDescriptionEmbedding ,
(
SELECT embeddings . values
FROM
ML . PREDICT (
MODEL EmbeddingsModel ,
( SELECT "I'd like to buy a starter bike for my 3 year old child" AS content ))
)) AS distance
FROM products
WHERE inventoryCount > 0
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 5 ;
Click Run to return the products that best match your search text.

Scale vector search to use approximate nearest neighbors
The previous vector search example uses exact,
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) vector search .
The KNN vector distance functions (cosine distance, euclidean distance, and dot
product) are helpful when you can query a specific subset of your
Spanner data. Because KNN search calculates the exact distance
between a query vector and all vectors in the database, it is efficient when you
can partition the data. If your query needs to compare the query vector to all
vectors in your database without any specific filters, and you can't divide the
query into independent subqueries, you might experience performance bottlenecks
if you use KNN. Approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) vector search becomes useful
in these situations. For more information, see Find approximate nearest
neighbors .
If your workloads aren't partitionable, and you have a large amount of data, you
can use ANN vector search to increase query performance for larger datasets.
To scale and use ANN vector search in Spanner, do the following:
Create a vector index
Modify your query to use an ANN distance function
Create a vector index
Spanner accelerates ANN vector searches by using a specialized
vector index that leverages Google Research's
Scalable Nearest Neighbor (ScaNN) .
To create a vector index in your dataset, you need to modify the
productDescriptionEmbeddings column to define a vector_length annotation.
The vector_length annotation indicates the dimension of each vector. The
following DDL statements drops the productDescriptionEmbedding
column, and re-creates it with the vector_length . The maximum
length (dimension) of the vector varies depending on the
embedding model
you've chosen.
In a new tab in Spanner Studio , copy and paste the following DDL
statement to re-create the productDescriptionEmbedding column:
ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN productDescriptionEmbedding ;
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN productDescriptionEmbedding ARRAY<FLOAT32> ( vector_length = > VECTOR_LENGTH_VALUE );
Replace VECTOR_LENGTH_VALUE with the maximum output
dimensions of the embedding model you've chosen.
Click Run .
Copy and paste the following insert statement to re-generate the vector
embeddings:
UPDATE products p1
SET productDescriptionEmbedding =
( SELECT embeddings . values from ML . PREDICT ( MODEL EmbeddingsModel ,
( SELECT p1 . productDescription as content )))
WHERE categoryId = 1 ;
Click Run .
Copy and paste the following DDL statement to create the vector index:
CREATE VECTOR INDEX ProductDescriptionEmbeddingIndex
ON products ( productDescriptionEmbedding )
WHERE productDescriptionEmbedding IS NOT NULL
OPTIONS (
distance_type = 'COSINE'
);
Click Run .
Note: In a production environment, instead of dropping the original embedding
column first, we recommend that you add a new column with the new
vector_length definition. Then, re-generate the embeddings in the new column.
Finally, modify your applications to use the new column before dropping the
original column.
Use ANN vector distance function
To use ANN vector search in Spanner, modify the following in your
SQL query:
Generate the prompt embedding separately, instead of within the SQL query.
Copy the results of the embeddings into the query.
Use the FORCE_INDEX hint to reference the new vector index: @{force_index=ProductDescriptionEmbeddingIndex}
Use the APPROX_COSINE_DISTANCE vector distance function instead of
COSINE_DISTANCE . The JSON '{"num_leaves_to_search": num_leaves }' option is required.
In a new tab in Spanner Studio , copy and paste the following query to
generate the prompt embedding and perform vector search:
-- Generate the prompt embedding
WITH embedding AS (
SELECT embeddings . values
FROM ML . PREDICT (
MODEL EmbeddingsModel ,
( SELECT "I'd like to buy a starter bike for my 3 year old child" as content )
)
)
-- Use embedding to find the most similar entries in the database
SELECT productName , productDescription , inventoryCount ,
( APPROX_COSINE_DISTANCE ( productDescriptionEmbedding ,
embedding . values ,
options = > JSON '{"num_leaves_to_search": 10}' )) as distance
FROM products @{ force_index = ProductDescriptionEmbeddingIndex } , embedding
WHERE productDescriptionEmbedding IS NOT NULL AND inventoryCount > 0
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 5 ;
Click Run .
Example output:
/*-----------------+--------------------+----------------+--------------------*
| productName | productDescription | inventoryCount | distance |
+------------------+--------------------+----------------+--------------------+
