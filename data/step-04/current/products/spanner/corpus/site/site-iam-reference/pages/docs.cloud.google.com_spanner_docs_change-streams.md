Change streams overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A change stream watches and streams out a Spanner
database's data changes —inserts, updates, and deletes—in near
real-time.
This page offers a high-level overview of Spanner change
streams: what they do, and how they work. To learn how to create and
manage change streams in your database and connect them with other
services, follow the links in What's Next .
Purpose of change streams
Change streams provide a flexible, scalable way to stream data
changes to other services. Common use cases include:
Replicating Spanner data changes to a data warehouse, such as
BigQuery , for analytics.
Triggering application logic based on data changes sent to a message
queue, such as Pub/Sub .
Storing data changes in Cloud Storage , for compliance
or archival purposes.
Change stream configuration
Spanner treats change streams as schema objects, much
like tables and indexes. As such, you create, modify, and delete change
streams using DDL statements , and you can view a database's
change streams just like other DDL-managed schema
objects.
You can configure a change stream to watch data changes across an
entire database, or limit its scope to specific tables and columns. A
database can have multiple change streams, and a particular table or
column can have multiple streams watching it, within
limits .
You can optionally configure a change stream with the following:
Specify the data retention period to override the
default, one-day retention period.
Specify the value capture type to override the
default value capture type OLD_AND_NEW_VALUES .
Apply a TTL-based deletes filter to filter out TTL-based
deletes from your change streams.
Apply a table modifications filter to exclude all
INSERT , UPDATE , or DELETE table modifications.
Enable transaction-level records exclusion
to exclude certain transactions from your change streams.
Issuing the DDL that creates a change stream starts a long-running
operation . When it
completes, the new change stream immediately begins to watch the tables
and columns assigned to it.
Implicitly watching tables and columns
Change streams that watch an entire table implicitly watch all the
columns in that table, even when that table definition is updated. For
example, when you add new columns to that table, the change stream
automatically begins to watch those new columns, without requiring any
modification to that change stream's configuration. Similarly, the
change stream automatically stops watching any columns that are dropped
from that table.
Whole-database change streams work the same way. They implicitly watch
every column in every table, automatically watching any tables or
columns added after the change stream's creation, and ceasing to watch
any tables or columns dropped.
Explicitly watching tables and columns
If you configure a change stream to watch only particular columns in a
table, and you later add columns to that table, the change stream will
not begin to watch those columns unless you reconfigure that change
stream to do so.
The database's schema treats change streams as dependent objects of any
columns or tables that they explicitly watch. Before you can drop any
such column or table, you must manually remove it from the configuration
of any change stream explicitly watching it.
Types of data changes that change streams watch
The data changes that a change stream watches include all inserts,
updates, and deletes made to the tables and columns that it watches. These
changes can come from:
DML statements
Mutations
Cascading deletes on interleaved child
tables
Deletes resulting from
time to live rules
Change streams can watch data changes only in user-created
columns and tables. They don't watch indexes, views, other change streams,
or system tables such as the information schema or statistics tables. Change
streams don't watch generated columns unless the column is part of the
primary key. Primary key columns are always tracked.
Furthermore, change streams don't watch schema changes or any data
changes that directly result from schema changes, other than backfills
for default values . For
example, a change stream watching an entire database doesn't consider
and record a table deletion as a data change, even though this action
deletes all of that table's data from the database.
How Spanner writes and stores change streams
Every time Spanner detects a data change in a column being
watched by a change stream, it writes a data change record to
its internal storage .
The data change write and the data change record are written within the same
transaction. Spanner co-locates both of these writes so they are
processed by the same server, minimizing write processing. The transaction is
then replicated across the database's replicas, subjecting it to storage and
replication costs.
For more information, see Spanner pricing .
Content of a data change record
Every data change record written by a change stream includes the
following information about the data change:
The name of the affected table
The names, values, and data types of the primary keys identifying the
changed row
The names and data types of the changed row's columns that were
captured based on the change stream definition.
The old values of the row's columns. The availability of the old values
and the content they track, which can be either the modified columns only or
the entire tracked row, depends on the user-configured value capture type .
The new values of the row's columns. The availability of the new values
and the content they track depends on the user-configured value capture type .
The modification type (insert, update, or delete)
The commit timestamp
The transaction ID
The record sequence number
The data change record's value capture type.
For a deeper look at the structure of data change records, see Data change records .
Note: A change stream's value capture type configuration option
controls the way that it records a changed row's values.
OLD_AND_NEW_VALUES is this option's default setting. For more information,
see value capture type .
Data retention
A change stream retains its data change records for a period of time
between one and thirty days. You can use DDL to
specify a data-retention limit other than the one-day default when
initially creating a change stream, or adjust it at any future time.
Note that reducing a change stream's data retention limit will make all
historical change data older than the new limit immediately and
permanently unavailable to that change stream's readers.
This data retention period presents a trade-off; a longer retention
period carries greater storage demands on
the stream's database.
Value capture type
A change stream's value capture type configuration option
controls the way that it stores a changed row's values. You can use DDL
to specify one of the following value capture types for a change stream:
OLD_AND_NEW_VALUES : Captures both old and new values of a row's modified
columns.
NEW_VALUES : Captures only the new values of the non-key columns, but no old
values.
NEW_ROW : Captures all new values of watched columns, both modified and
unmodified, whenever any of those columns change. No old values are captured.
NEW_ROW_AND_OLD_VALUES : Captures all new values for both modified and
unmodified columns, and old values for modified columns.
Exclude time-to-live based deletes
In Spanner, time-to-live (TTL) lets you
set policies to periodically delete data from Spanner tables.
By default, change streams include all TTL-based deletes. You can use
exclude_ttl_deletes to set your change stream to exclude TTL-based deletes.
When you set this filter to exclude TTL-based deletes, only future TTL-based
deletes are excluded from your change stream.
The default value for this filter is false . To exclude TTL-based deletes,
set the filter to true . You can either
add the filter when you create a change stream
or
modify an existing change stream to include the filter .
Table modification type
By default, change streams include all table modifications, such as inserts,
updates, and deletes.
You can filter one or more of these table modifications from your
change stream's scope using the following available filter options:
exclude_insert : exclude all INSERT table modifications
exclude_update : exclude all UPDATE table modifications
exclude_delete : exclude all DELETE table modifications
The default value for these filters is false . To exclude a specific type of
table modification, set the filter to true . You can set one or more
filters at the same time.
You can add a filter for a table modification type
when you create a change stream or
modify the filter for a table modification type
for an existing change stream.
Transaction-level records exclusion
By default, a change stream watches all write transactions in the database
because the allow_txn_exclusion DDL option is set to false . You can set the
allow_txn_exclusion option to true to enable your change stream to
ignore records from specified write transactions. If you don't set this option
to true , then all write transactions are watched, even if you use the
exclude_txn_from_change_streams parameter in your write transaction.
You can either enable this option when you create a change stream
or modify an existing change stream .
Exclude write transaction from change streams
To exclude a write transaction from change streams, you must set the
exclude_txn_from_change_streams parameter to true . This parameter is
part of the
TransactionOptions and
BatchWriteRequest
methods. The default value for this parameter is false . You can set this
parameter with the RPC API, REST API, or using the client libraries. For more
information, see Specify a write transaction to be excluded from change streams .
You can't set this parameter to true for read-only transactions. If you do
this, then the API returns an invalid argument error.
For change streams monitoring columns modified by transactions, when
exclude_txn_from_change_streams is set to true , two scenarios are possible:
If the DDL option allow_txn_exclusion is set to true , then the updates
made within this transaction aren't recorded in the change stream.
If you don't set the DDL option allow_txn_exclusion or if it's set to
false , then the updates made within this transaction are recorded in the
change stream.
If you don't set the exclude_txn_from_change_streams option or if it's set to
false , then any change streams monitoring columns modified by transactions
will capture the updates made within that transaction.
Reading change streams
Spanner offers multiple ways to read a change stream's data:
Through Dataflow, using the Apache Beam SpannerIO connector.
This is our recommended solution for most change stream applications.
Google also provides Dataflow templates for common use cases.
Directly, using the Spanner API. This trades away the
abstraction and capabilities of Dataflow pipelines for maximum
speed and flexibility.
Through using the Debezium-based Kafka connector for Spanner
change streams. This connector streams change records directly into Kafka topics.
Using Datastream to directly stream your changes to BigQuery,
BigLake Iceberg tables, or Cloud Storage.
You can provide partial isolation for change streams reads by using directed
reads. Directed reads can help to minimize impact on transactional workloads in
your database. You can use the Spanner API to route change
streams reads to a specific replica type or region within a multi-region
instance configuration or a custom regional configuration with optional
read-only region(s). For more information, see directed reads .
Using Dataflow
Use the Apache Beam SpannerIO connector
to build Dataflow pipelines that read from change streams. After
you configure the connector with details
about a particular change stream, it automatically outputs new data
change records into a single, unbounded
PCollection
data set, ready for further processing by subsequent transforms in the
Dataflow pipeline.
Dataflow uses windowing functions to divide unbounded collections into
logical components, or windows. As a result, Dataflow provides
near real-time streaming when
reading from change streams.
Google provides templates that let you rapidly build
Dataflow pipelines for common change stream use cases,
including sending all of a stream's data changes to a
BigQuery dataset, or copying them to a
Cloud Storage bucket .
For a more detailed overview of how change streams and Dataflow
work together, see Build change streams connections with Dataflow .
Using the API
As an alternative to using Dataflow to build change stream
pipelines, you can instead write code that uses the
Spanner API to read a change stream's records directly. This
lets you read data change records in the same way that the SpannerIO
connector does, by providing the lowest possible latencies when reading change
stream data instead of providing the flexibility of Dataflow.
To learn more, see Query change streams . For a more detailed
discussion on how to query change streams and interpret the records
returned, see Change streams partitions, records, and queries .
Using the Kafka connector
The Kafka connector directly outputs change stream records into a Kafka topic.
It abstracts away the details of querying change streams using
the Spanner API.
To learn more about how change streams and the Kafka connector work
together, see Build change streams connections with the Kafka connector .
Using Datastream
Use Datastream, a serverless and easy-to-use change data capture (CDC)
and replication service available in Google Cloud. Datastream supports
Spanner change streams, and lets you read from and stream your change
data into various destinations.
To learn more about how Datastream supports Spanner for
reading and streaming change data, see Spanner as a source .
Limits
There are several limits on change streams, including the maximum number
of change streams a database can have, and the maximum number of streams
that can watch a single column. For a full list, see Change stream
limits .
Permissions
Change streams uses the following:
Creating, updating, or dropping change streams requires
spanner.databases.updateDdl .
Reading a change stream's data requires spanner.databases.select .
If using the SpannerIO connector, then the owner of the
Dataflow job that reads change stream data requires additional
Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions, either on your application database or on a separate
metadata database; see Create a metadata database .
