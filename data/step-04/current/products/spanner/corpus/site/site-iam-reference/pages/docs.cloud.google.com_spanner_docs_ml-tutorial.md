Generate ML predictions using SQL
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows how to generate machine learning (ML) predictions from a
Spanner database. ML predictions work with both
GoogleSQL-dialect databases and PostgreSQL-dialect databases.
Spanner Vertex AI integration gives you the ability to generate predictions using your
SQL code by calling the
ML.PREDICT
function for GoogleSQL or the
spanner.ML_PREDICT_ROW
function for PostgreSQL. For more information about
Spanner Vertex AI integration, see Spanner Vertex AI integration overview .
Before you begin
Before you can generate predictions from a Spanner instance,
you must prepare your database and select a model.
Configure access for Spanner Vertex AI integration to Vertex AI endpoints
Spanner creates the service agent and grants the necessary permissions
automatically when Spanner executes the first MODEL DDL statement. If
both the Spanner database and the Vertex AI endpoint are in
the same project, no additional setup is required.
If the Spanner service agent account doesn't exist for your
Spanner project, create it by running the
following command:
gcloud beta services identity create --service = spanner.googleapis.com --project ={ PROJECT } `
Follow the steps described in the Grant a single role to
grant the Spanner API Service Agent role to the
Spanner service agent account
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-spanner.iam.gserviceaccount.com on your
Vertex AI project.
Select a model
When you use the ML.PREDICT (for GoogleSQL) or the
spanner.ML_PREDICT_ROW (for PostgreSQL) function, you must specify the location
of the ML model. Your selected model can be one of the following:
A model running in the
Vertex AI Model Garden .
A Vertex AI model with an active endpoint that your
Spanner service agent has IAM permission to access.
To learn more about Spanner Vertex AI integration, see
How does Spanner Vertex AI integration work? .
Generate predictions
Depending on the type of your selected model, the steps to generating
your predictions will differ.
Use a model in the Vertex AI Model Garden
To generate a prediction using a model from the Vertex AI Model Garden,
select a model from the Model Garden .
GoogleSQL
Before you use a model with ML.PREDICT() , you need to register the model
using the CREATE MODEL statement.
CREATE MODEL ' MODEL_NAME '
INPUT ( INPUT_COLUMN_NAME INPUT_COLUMN_TYPE )
OUTPUT ( OUTPUT_COLUMN_NAME OUTPUT_COLUMN_TYPE )
REMOTE
OPTIONS (
endpoint = '//aiplatform.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /publishers/google/models/ model_id '
);
Replace the following:
MODEL_NAME : the name you want to give your model
INPUT_COLUMN_NAME : the name of your input column. For example,
if using the gemini-pro model, the input column name is prompt .
INPUT_COLUMN_TYPE : the data type for INPUT_COLUMN_NAME
OUTPUT_COLUMN_NAME : the name of your output column. For example,
if using the gemini-pro model, the output column name is content .
OUTPUT_COLUMN_TYPE : the data type for OUTPUT_COLUMN_NAME
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
REGION_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud region that the model is
located in—for example, us-central1
MODEL_ID : the ID of the ML model you want to use—for example, gemini-pro
For more information about models, see
Model API reference for Generative AI .
Use the ML.PREDICT
GoogleSQL function with the model selected
from the Model Garden to generate your prediction.
SELECT * FROM ML . PREDICT (
MODEL ` MODEL_NAME ` ,
` INPUT_RELATION ` [ , ` PARAMETERS ` ] )
Replace the following:
MODEL_NAME : the name you want to give your model
For more information about models, see
Model API reference for Generative AI .
INPUT_RELATION : either TABLE table_name or a subquery the table or subquery supplying data
to run the ML prediction on.
PARAMETERS : a STRUCT value that contains parameters
supported by model_id .
You can also use SAFE.ML.PREDICT to return null instead of an error in
your predictions. This is helpful in cases when running large queries
where some failed predictions are tolerable.
PostgreSQL
Use the ML_PREDICT_ROW PostgreSQL function with the model selected
from the Model Garden to generate your prediction.
SELECT spanner . ml_predict_row (
'projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION_ID /publishers/google/models/ MODEL_ID ' :: text ,
'{
"instances": [ INSTANCES ],
"parameters": { PARAMETERS }
}' :: jsonb );
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
REGION_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud region that the model is
located in—for example, us-central1
MODEL_ID : the ID of the ML model you want to use—for example, gemini-pro
For more information about models, see
Model API reference for Generative AI .
INSTANCES : the inputs for the prediction call, in JSON format
PARAMETERS : optional parameters for the prediction call, in JSON format
This query produces a JSON response. For more information about the
model's JSON response messages, see PredictResponse .
Use a Vertex AI model endpoint
To use a trained or downloaded model with Spanner Vertex AI integration, you need to deploy the model
to Vertex AI. For more information on how
to deploy a model to an endpoint in Vertex AI, see
Deploy a model to an endpoint .
GoogleSQL
Use the ML.PREDICT GoogleSQL function with the model in a
Vertex AI endpoint to generate your prediction. Before you use a
model with ML.PREDICT() , you need to register the model using
the CREATE MODEL
statement. Each deployed model has its own unique
schema. The following is an example schema from
Classification and regression Overview
CREATE MODEL MyClassificationModel
INPUT (
length FLOAT64 ,
material STRING ( MAX ),
tag_array ARRAY<STRING ( MAX ) >
)
OUTPUT (
scores ARRAY<FLOAT64> ,
classes ARRAY<STRING ( MAX ) >
)
REMOTE
OPTIONS (
endpoint = '//aiplatform.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /endpoints/ ENDPOINT_ID '
)
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
LOCATION : the ID of the Google Cloud region that the model is
located in—for example, us-central1
ENDPOINT_ID : the ID of the ML model you want to use—for example, gemini-pro
For more information about models, see
Model API reference for Generative AI .
Use the ML.PREDICT
GoogleSQL function with the model selected
from the Model Garden to generate your prediction.
SELECT * FROM ML . PREDICT (
` MODEL_ID ` ,
` INPUT_RELATION ` [ , ` PARAMETERS ` ] )
Replace the following:
MODEL_ID : the ID of the ML model you want to use.
INPUT_RELATION : the table or subquery that you want
to run the ML prediction on.
PARAMETERS : a STRUCT value that contains parameters
supported by model_name .
This query produces a relation containing all output columns of the model and
all columns of the input relation.
PostgreSQL
Use the ML.PREDICT PostgreSQL function with the model in a
Vertex AI endpoint to generate your prediction.
SELECT spanner . ml_predict_row (
'projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION_ID /endpoints/ ENDPOINT_ID ' :: text ,
'{
"instances": [ INSTANCES ],
"parameters": { PARAMETERS }
}' :: jsonb );
```
Replace the following :
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project that the model is
located in
REGION_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud region the model is
located in—for example, us-central1
ENDPOINT_ID : the ID of the model endpoint
INSTANCES : the inputs to the prediction call, in JSON format
PARAMETERS : optional parameters to the prediction call, in JSON format
This query produces a JSON response. For more information about the
model's JSON response messages, see PredictResponse .
