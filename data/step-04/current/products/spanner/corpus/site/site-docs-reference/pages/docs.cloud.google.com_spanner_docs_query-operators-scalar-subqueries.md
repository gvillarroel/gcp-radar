Scalar subqueries
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A scalar subquery is a SQL sub-expression that's part of a scalar expression.
Spanner attempts to remove scalar subqueries whenever possible.
However, in certain scenarios, plans explicitly contain scalar subqueries.
PostgreSQL interface note:
The examples in this topic are intended for GoogleSQL-dialect databases. This feature doesn't support
PostgreSQL interface.
Database schema
The queries and execution plans on this page are based on the following database
schema:
CREATE TABLE Singers (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
FirstName STRING ( 1024 ),
LastName STRING ( 1024 ),
SingerInfo BYTES ( MAX ),
BirthDate DATE
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId );
CREATE INDEX SingersByFirstLastName ON Singers ( FirstName , LastName );
CREATE TABLE Albums (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
AlbumId INT64 NOT NULL ,
AlbumTitle STRING ( MAX ),
MarketingBudget INT64
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId , AlbumId ),
INTERLEAVE IN PARENT Singers ON DELETE CASCADE ;
CREATE INDEX AlbumsByAlbumTitle ON Albums ( AlbumTitle );
CREATE INDEX AlbumsByAlbumTitle2 ON Albums ( AlbumTitle ) STORING ( MarketingBudget );
CREATE TABLE Songs (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
AlbumId INT64 NOT NULL ,
TrackId INT64 NOT NULL ,
SongName STRING ( MAX ),
Duration INT64 ,
SongGenre STRING ( 25 )
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId , AlbumId , TrackId ),
INTERLEAVE IN PARENT Albums ON DELETE CASCADE ;
CREATE INDEX SongsBySingerAlbumSongNameDesc ON Songs ( SingerId , AlbumId , SongName DESC ), INTERLEAVE IN Albums ;
CREATE INDEX SongsBySongName ON Songs ( SongName );
CREATE TABLE Concerts (
VenueId INT64 NOT NULL ,
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
ConcertDate DATE NOT NULL ,
BeginTime TIMESTAMP ,
EndTime TIMESTAMP ,
TicketPrices ARRAY<INT64>
) PRIMARY KEY ( VenueId , SingerId , ConcertDate );
You can use the following Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements to add
data to these tables:
INSERT INTO Singers ( SingerId , FirstName , LastName , BirthDate )
VALUES ( 1 , "Marc" , "Richards" , "1970-09-03" ),
( 2 , "Catalina" , "Smith" , "1990-08-17" ),
( 3 , "Alice" , "Trentor" , "1991-10-02" ),
( 4 , "Lea" , "Martin" , "1991-11-09" ),
( 5 , "David" , "Lomond" , "1977-01-29" );
INSERT INTO Albums ( SingerId , AlbumId , AlbumTitle )
VALUES ( 1 , 1 , "Total Junk" ),
( 1 , 2 , "Go, Go, Go" ),
( 2 , 1 , "Green" ),
( 2 , 2 , "Forever Hold Your Peace" ),
( 2 , 3 , "Terrified" ),
( 3 , 1 , "Nothing To Do With Me" ),
( 4 , 1 , "Play" );
INSERT INTO Songs ( SingerId , AlbumId , TrackId , SongName , Duration , SongGenre )
VALUES ( 2 , 1 , 1 , "Let's Get Back Together" , 182 , "COUNTRY" ),
( 2 , 1 , 2 , "Starting Again" , 156 , "ROCK" ),
( 2 , 1 , 3 , "I Knew You Were Magic" , 294 , "BLUES" ),
( 2 , 1 , 4 , "42" , 185 , "CLASSICAL" ),
( 2 , 1 , 5 , "Blue" , 238 , "BLUES" ),
( 2 , 1 , 6 , "Nothing Is The Same" , 303 , "BLUES" ),
( 2 , 1 , 7 , "The Second Time" , 255 , "ROCK" ),
( 2 , 3 , 1 , "Fight Story" , 194 , "ROCK" ),
( 3 , 1 , 1 , "Not About The Guitar" , 278 , "BLUES" );
Note: You can run queries and retrieve execution plans even if the tables have
no data.
The following query demonstrates a scalar expression operator:
SELECT firstname ,
IF ( firstname = 'Alice' , ( SELECT Count ( * )
FROM songs
WHERE duration > 300 ), 0 )
FROM singers ;
/*-----------+----+
| FirstName | |
+-----------+----+
| Alice | 1 |
| Catalina | 0 |
| David | 0 |
| Lea | 0 |
| Marc | 0 |
+-----------+----*/
The execution plan appears as follows:
The execution plan displays a scalar subquery as Scalar Subquery
above an aggregate operator.
Spanner sometimes converts scalar subqueries into another
operator such as a join or cross apply, to possibly improve performance.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT *
FROM songs
WHERE duration = ( SELECT Max ( duration )
FROM songs );
/*----------+---------+---------+---------------------+----------+-----------+
| SingerId | AlbumId | TrackId | SongName | Duration | SongGenre |
+----------+---------+---------+---------------------+----------+-----------+
| 2 | 1 | 6 | Nothing Is The Same | 303 | BLUES |
+----------+---------+---------+---------------------+----------+-----------*/
The execution plan appears as follows:
The execution plan excludes a scalar subquery because Spanner
converted the scalar subquery to a cross apply.
Properties and execution statistics
A property of an operator describes a trait that is used when the operator is
executed. An execution statistic is a value collected during query execution
to help you assess performance of the operator.
Properties
Name
Description
Execution method
In Row execution, the operator processes one row at a time.
In Batch execution, the operator processes a batch of rows at once.
Execution statistics
Name
Description
Latency
Elapsed time of all the executions done in the operator.
Cumulative latency
The total time of the current operator and its descendants.
CPU time
Sum of CPU time spent executing the operator.
Cumulative CPU time
The total CPU time spent executing the operator and its descendants.
Execution time
The total amount of time taken to run the query and process results.
Rows returned
The number of rows output by this operator
Number of executions
The number of times the operator was executed. Some executions can run
in parallel.
