Information schema for GoogleSQL-dialect databases
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The information schema is a built-in schema that's common to every
Spanner database. You can run SQL queries against tables in the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA to fetch schema metadata for a database.
For example, the following query fetches the names of all user-defined tables in
a database:
SELECT
table_schema ,
table_name
FROM
information_schema . tables
WHERE
table_schema NOT IN ( 'information_schema' , 'SPANNER_SYS' )
AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
Fine-grained access control users see filtered results for some INFORMATION_SCHEMA
tables depending on their database role. For more information, see About
fine-grained access control .
Usage
INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables are available only through SQL interfaces, for
example:
The executeQuery API
The gcloud spanner databases execute-sql command
The Spanner Studio page of a database in the Google Cloud console)
Other single read methods don't support INFORMATION_SCHEMA .
Some additional INFORMATION_SCHEMA usage notes:
Queries against the INFORMATION_SCHEMA can be used in a read-only
transaction , but not in a
read-write transaction .
Queries against the INFORMATION_SCHEMA can use strong, bounded staleness,
or exact staleness timestamp bounds .
If you are using a PostgreSQL-dialect database, see Information schema for
PostgreSQL-dialect databases .
If you are a fine-grained access control user,
INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables are filtered to only show schema elements that
you have access to.
Row filtering in information_schema tables
Principals with database-level IAM permissions and principals who
have been granted access to the spanner_info_reader system
role (or to members of that role) can see all rows in all
information_schema tables. For other principals, for some tables, rows are
filtered based on the current database role. The table and view descriptions in
the following sections indicate how row filtering is applied for each table and
view.
