( 2 , 3 , 1 , "Fight Story" , 194 , "ROCK" ),
( 3 , 1 , 1 , "Not About The Guitar" , 278 , "BLUES" );
Note: You can run queries and retrieve execution plans even if the tables have
no data.
Aggregate
An aggregate operator implements GROUP BY SQL statements and aggregate
functions (such as COUNT ). The input for an aggregate operator is logically
partitioned into groups arranged on key columns (or into a single group if
GROUP BY isn't present). For each group, zero or more aggregates are computed.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT s . singerid ,
Avg ( s . duration ) AS average ,
Count ( * ) AS count
FROM songs AS s
GROUP BY singerid ;
/*----------+---------+-------+
| SingerId | average | count |
+----------+---------+-------+
| 3 | 278 | 1 |
| 2 | 225.875 | 8 |
+----------+---------+-------*/
The query groups by SingerId and performs an AVG aggregation and a COUNT
aggregation.
The execution plan segment appears as follows:
Aggregate operators can be stream-based or hash-based . The previous
execution plan shows a stream-based aggregate. Stream-based aggregates read from
pre-sorted input (if GROUP BY is present) and compute the group
without blocking. Hash-based aggregates build hash tables to maintain
incremental aggregates of multiple input rows simultaneously. Stream-based
aggregates are faster and use less memory than hash-based aggregates, but
require the input to be sorted (either by key columns or secondary
indexes ).
For distributed scenarios, the aggregate operator splits into a
local-global pair. Each remote server performs the local aggregation on its
input rows, and then returns its results to the root server. The root server
performs the global aggregation.
Properties and execution statistics
A property of an operator describes a trait that is used when the operator is
executed. An execution statistic is a value collected during query execution
to help you assess performance of the operator.

Apply mutations
An apply mutations operator applies the mutations from a Data Manipulation
Language (DML) statement to the table. It's the top operator in
a query plan for a DML statement.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
DELETE FROM singers
WHERE firstname = 'Alice' ;
/*
4 rows deleted This statement deleted 4 rows and did not return any rows.
*/
The execution plan appears as follows:

Create batch
A create batch operator batches its input rows into a sequence. A create batch
operation usually occurs as a part of a distributed cross
apply operation. The input rows can be re-ordered
during the batching. The number of input rows that get batched in each execution
of the batch operator varies.
See the distributed cross apply operator for an
example of a create batch operator in an execution plan.

Compute struct
A compute struct operator creates a variable for a structure that contains
fields for each of the input columns.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT FirstName ,
ARRAY ( SELECT AS STRUCT song . SongName , song . SongGenre
FROM Songs AS song
WHERE song . SingerId = singer . SingerId )
FROM singers AS singer
WHERE singer . SingerId = 3 ;
/*-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| FirstName | Unspecified |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Alice | [["Not About The Guitar","BLUES"]] |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------*/
The execution plan appears as follows:
In the execution plan, the array subquery operator receives input from a compute
struct operator. The compute struct operator creates a structure from the
SongName and SongGenre columns in the Songs table.

Rows returned
The number of rows output by this operator
Number of executions
The number of times the operator was executed. Some executions can run

Filter
A filter operator reads all rows from its input, applies a scalar predicate on
each row, and then returns only the rows that satisfy the predicate.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT s . lastname
FROM ( SELECT s . lastname
FROM singers AS s
LIMIT 3 ) s
WHERE s . lastname LIKE 'Rich%' ;
/*----------+
| LastName |
+----------+
| Richards |
+----------*/
The execution plan appears as follows:
Spanner implements the predicate for singers whose last name starts with Rich as a
filter. The filter receives input from an index scan and outputs rows where LastName starts with Rich .

Rows returned
The number of rows output by this operator
Number of executions
The number of times the operator was executed. Some executions can run
in parallel.
Limit
A limit operator constrains the number of rows returned. An optional OFFSET
parameter specifies the starting row to return. In distributed scenarios, the
limit operator splits into a local-global pair. Each remote server
applies the local limit for its output rows, and then returns its results to the
root server. The root server aggregates the rows sent by the remote servers and
then applies the global limit.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT s . songname
FROM songs AS s
LIMIT 3 ;
/*----------------------+
| SongName |
+----------------------+
| Not About The Guitar |
| The Second Time |
| Starting Again |
+----------------------*/
The execution plan appears as follows:
The local limit is the limit for each remote server. The root server aggregates
the rows from the remote servers and then applies the global limit.

Execution time
The total amount of time taken to run the query and process results.
Rows returned
The number of rows output by this operator
Number of executions
The number of times the operator was executed. Some executions can run
in parallel.
Random ID assign
A random ID assign operator produces output by reading its input rows and
adding a random number to each row. It works with a Filter or Sort operator
to achieve sampling methods. Supported sampling methods are
Bernoulli
and Reservoir .
For example, the following query uses Bernoulli sampling with a sampling rate of
10 percent.
SELECT s . songname
FROM songs AS s TABLESAMPLE bernoulli ( 10 PERCENT );
/*----------------+
| SongName |
+----------------+
| Starting Again |
+----------------*/
Because the result is a sample, the result could vary each time the
query is run even though the query is the same.
In this execution plan, the Random Id Assign operator receives its input from
a distributed union operator, which receives its input
from an index scan . The operator returns the rows with random ids and
the Filter operator then applies a scalar predicate on the random ids and
returns approximately 10 percent of the rows.
The following example uses Reservoir
sampling with a sampling rate of 2 rows.
SELECT s . songname
FROM songs AS s TABLESAMPLE reservoir ( 2 rows );
/*------------------------+
| SongName |
+------------------------+
| I Knew You Were Magic |
| The Second Time |
+------------------------*/
Because the result is a sample, the result could vary each time the
query is run even though the query is the same.
This is the execution plan:
In this execution plan, the Random Id Assign operator receives its input from
a distributed union operator, which receives its input
from an index scan . The operator returns the rows with random ids and
the Sort operator then applies the sort order on the random ids and applies
LIMIT with 2 rows.

Rows returned
The number of rows output by this operator
Number of executions
The number of times the operator was executed. Some executions can run
in parallel.
Local split union
A local split union operator finds table splits stored on the local
server, runs a subquery on each split, and then creates a union that combines
all results.
A local split union appears in execution plans that scan a placement
table. Placements can increase the number of splits in a table, making it more
efficient to scan splits in batches based on their physical storage locations.
For example, suppose the Singers table uses a placement key to partition
singer data:
CREATE TABLE Singers (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
SingerName STRING ( MAX ) NOT NULL ,
...
Location STRING ( MAX ) NOT NULL PLACEMENT KEY
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId );
Now, consider this query:
SELECT BirthDate FROM Singers ;
This is the execution plan:
The distributed union sends a subquery to each batch of
splits physically stored together in the same server. On each server, the local
split union finds splits storing Singers data, executes the subquery on each
split, and returns the combined results. In this way, the distributed union and
local split union work together to efficiently scan the Singers table. Without
a local split union, the distributed union would send one RPC per split instead
of per split batch, resulting in redundant RPC round trips when there's more
than one split per batch.

Serialize result
A serialize result operator is a special case of the compute struct operator
that serializes each row of the final result of the query, for returning to the
client.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT array
(
select as struct so . songname ,
so . songgenre
FROM songs AS so
WHERE so . singerid = s . singerid )
FROM singers AS s ;
/*------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Unspecified |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| [] |
| [[Let's Get Back Together, COUNTRY], [Starting Again, ROCK]] |
| [["Not About The Guitar", "BLUES"]] |
| [] |
| [] |
+------------------------------------------------------------------*/
The execution plan appears as follows:
The serialize result operator creates a result that contains, for each row of
the Singers table, an array of SongName and SongGenre pairs for the songs
by the singer.

returns the sorted results.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT s . songgenre
FROM songs AS s
ORDER BY songgenre ;
/*--------------------------+
| SongGenre |
+--------------------------+
| BLUES |
| BLUES |
| BLUES |
| BLUES |
| CLASSICAL |
| COUNTRY |
| ROCK |
| ROCK |
| ROCK |
+--------------------------*/
The execution plan appears as follows:
In this execution plan, the sort operator receives its input rows from a
distributed union operator, sorts the input rows, and
returns the sorted rows to a serialize result operator.
To constrain the number of rows returned, a sort operator can optionally have
LIMIT and OFFSET parameters. For distributed scenarios, a sort operator with
a LIMIT or OFFSET operator splits into a local-global pair. Each
remote server applies the sort order and the local limit or offset for its input
rows, and then returns its results to the root server. The root server
aggregates the rows sent by the remote servers, sorts them, and then applies the
global limit/offset.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT s . songgenre
FROM songs AS s
ORDER BY songgenre
LIMIT 3 ;
/*--------------------------+
| SongGenre |
+--------------------------+
| BLUES |
| BLUES |
| BLUES |
+--------------------------*/
The execution plan appears as follows:
The execution plan shows the local limit for the remote servers and the global
limit for the root server.

the same number of rows as input. It can also be a generator that returns more
rows or a filter that returns fewer rows.
The following query demonstrates this operator:

Cumulative latency
The total time of the current operator and its descendants.
CPU time
Sum of CPU time spent executing the operator.
Cumulative CPU time
The total CPU time spent executing the operator and its descendants.
Execution time
The total amount of time taken to run the query and process results.
Rows returned
The number of rows output by this operator
Number of executions
The number of times the operator was executed. Some executions can run
in parallel.
Union input
A union input operator returns results to a union all operator.
See the union all operator for an example of a union input
operator in an execution plan.
Properties and execution statistics
A property of an operator describes a trait that is used when the operator is
executed. An execution statistic is a value collected during query execution
to help you assess performance of the operator.
The Filter operator has additional distinct properties.
Properties
Name
