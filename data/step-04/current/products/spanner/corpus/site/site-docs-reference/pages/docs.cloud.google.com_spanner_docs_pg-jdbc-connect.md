Connect JDBC to a PostgreSQL-dialect database
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can use either the PostgreSQL JDBC driver or the
Spanner JDBC driver with a Spanner PostgreSQL-dialect database. This page
explains how to connect to your database with these drivers.
PostgreSQL JDBC driver
This section explains how to connect the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to a
PostgreSQL-dialect database in Spanner. JDBC is the standard Java driver for
PostgreSQL.
If you use the PostgreSQL JDBC driver, you must use PGAdapter
to translate between the PostgreSQL network protocol and the
Spanner network protocol. You can add PGAdapter as a
dependency and run it in-process with your application.
Add PGAdapter and the PostgreSQL JDBC driver as dependencies
to your application.
<dependency>
<groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
<artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
<version>0.54.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>google-cloud-spanner-pgadapter</artifactId>
<version>0.54.0</version>
</dependency>
Start PGAdapter in-process with your application.
OptionsMetadata . Builder builder =
OptionsMetadata . newBuilder ()
. setProject ( " PROJECT_NAME " )
. setInstance ( " INSTANCE_NAME " )
. setPort ( PORT );
ProxyServer server = new ProxyServer ( builder . build ());
server . startServer ();
server . awaitRunning ();
Replace the following:
PORT : the port number where PGAdapter is
running. Set to 5432 in most cases or 0 to
use a dynamically assigned port.
Make sure the PostgreSQL JDBC driver driver is loaded.
Class . forName ( "org.postgresql.Driver" );
try ( Connection connection =
DriverManager . getConnection ( "jdbc:postgresql:// APPLICATION_HOST : PORT / DATABASE_NAME " )) {
try ( ResultSet resultSet =
connection . createStatement (). executeQuery ( "select 'Hello world!' as hello" )) {
while ( resultSet . next ()) {
System . out . printf (
"Greetings from Cloud Spanner PostgreSQL: %s\n" , resultSet . getString ( 1 ));
}
}
}
Replace the following:
APPLICATION_HOST : the hostname or IP address of
the machine where PGAdapter is running. If running locally,
use localhost .
The PGAdapter GitHub repository contains a
sample application.
Unix domain sockets
This section explains how to use Unix domain sockets to connect
PostgreSQL JDBC driver to a PostgreSQL-dialect database. Use Unix domain sockets for the
lowest possible latency.
To use Unix domain sockets, PGAdapter must be running on the
same host as the client application.
// Make sure the PG JDBC driver is loaded.
Class . forName ( "org.postgresql.Driver" );
try ( Connection connection = DriverManager . getConnection ( "jdbc:postgresql:// APPLICATION_HOST / DATABASE_NAME "
+ "?socketFactory=org.newsclub.net.unix.AFUNIXSocketFactory$FactoryArg"
+ "&socketFactoryArg= DIRECTORY_NAME .s.PGSQL. PORT " )) {
try ( ResultSet resultSet = connection . createStatement (). executeQuery ( "select 'Hello world!' as hello" )) {
while ( resultSet . next ()) {
System . out . printf ( "Greeting from Cloud Spanner PostgreSQL: %s\n" , resultSet . getString ( 1 ));
}
}
}
Replace the following:
APPLICATION_HOST : the hostname or IP address of
the machine where PGAdapter is running. If running locally,
use localhost .
command-line argument. For example, /tmp .
PORT : the port number where PGAdapter is
running. Change this in the connection string if PGAdapter is
running on a custom port. Otherwise, use the default port,
5432 .
Spanner JDBC driver
This section explains how to use the Spanner JDBC driver to
connect to a PostgreSQL-dialect database database.
Add the Spanner JDBC driver as a dependency to your application.
<dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>libraries-bom</artifactId>
<version>26.76.0</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>google-cloud-spanner-jdbc</artifactId>
<exclusions>
<exclusion>
<groupId>com.google.api.grpc</groupId>
<artifactId>proto-google-cloud-spanner-executor-v1</artifactId>
</exclusion>
</exclusions>
</dependency>
Use a Spanner JDBC connection URL to connect to the
PostgreSQL-dialect database.
// Make sure the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is loaded.
Class . forName ( "org.postgresql.Driver" );
try ( Connection connection = DriverManager . getConnection (
"jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/ PROJECT_NAME /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME /databases/ DATABASE_NAME " )) {
try ( ResultSet resultSet =
connection . createStatement (). executeQuery ( "select 'Hello world!' as hello" )) {
while ( resultSet . next ()) {
System . out . printf (
"Greetings from Cloud Spanner PostgreSQL: %s\n" , resultSet . getString ( 1 ));
}
}
}
The driver automatically detects the SQL dialect of the specified
database. A dialect parameter in the connection URL is not required.
