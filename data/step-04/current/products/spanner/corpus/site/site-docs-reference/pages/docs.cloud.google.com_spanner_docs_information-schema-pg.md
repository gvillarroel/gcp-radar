Information schema for PostgreSQL-dialect databases
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The information schema is a built-in schema that's common to every
PostgreSQL database. You can run SQL queries against tables in the
information_schema to fetch schema metadata for a database.
For example, the following query fetches the names of all user-defined tables in
a database:
SELECT
table_schema ,
table_name
FROM
information_schema . tables
WHERE
table_schema NOT IN ( 'pg_catalog' , 'information_schema' , 'SPANNER_SYS' )
AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
Usage
information_schema tables are available only through SQL interfaces, for
example:
The executeQuery API
The gcloud spanner databases execute-sql command
The Query page of a database in the Google Cloud console.
Other single read methods don't support information_schema .
Queries against the information_schema can use strong, bounded staleness,
or exact staleness timestamp bounds .
If you are using a GoogleSQL-dialect database, see Information schema for GoogleSQL-dialect databases .
Differences from information_schema for PostgreSQL
The tables in the information_schema for PostgreSQL-dialect databases include columns from
the tables in the information_schema for open source PostgreSQL and in
some cases also include columns from Spanner. In these tables,
the open source PostgreSQL columns come first and in the same order as
they do for a open source PostgreSQL database, and any distinct columns
for Spanner are appended afterwards. Queries written for the
open source PostgreSQL version of information_schema should work without
modification when using PostgreSQL-dialect databases in Google Cloud CLI.
Note: Queries against the information_schema for PostgreSQL-dialect databases that use
select * and reference columns by offset might not work the same as they do
against open source PostgreSQL databases. The GoogleSQL-specific
columns can shift in position if PostgreSQL adds new columns to an
information_schema table.
Other notable differences in the information_schema for PostgreSQL-dialect databases are:
Some of the table columns for open source PostgreSQL are available,
but not populated in PostgreSQL-dialect databases.
PostgreSQL-dialect databases use public for the default schema name.
Automatically generated constraint names use a different format than
open source PostgreSQL databases.
Tables related to open source PostgreSQL features that are not
supported in PostgreSQL-dialect databases are not available.
Some tables that are available with Spanner but not
open source PostgreSQL, such as database_options , index_columns ,
indexes , and spanner_statistics are available.
Row filtering in information_schema tables and views
Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and
principals who have been granted access to the spanner_info_reader system
role (or to members of that role) can see all
rows in all information_schema tables and views. For other principals,
Spanner filters rows based on the current database role. The
table and view descriptions in the following sections indicate how
Spanner filters rows for each table and view.
Tables in information_schema for PostgreSQL-dialect databases
The tables and views in the information_schema are compatible with the tables
and views in the information_schema of open source PostgreSQL.
The following sections describe the tables and views in the information_schema
for PostgreSQL-dialect databases.
applicable_roles
This row-filtered view lists all role memberships that are explicitly granted to
all database roles. Principals that have database-level IAM
permissions and principals who have been granted access to the
spanner_info_reader system role or to members of that role can see all rows in
this view. All other principals can see only the role memberships that are
granted to the current database role or to a role of which the current database
role is a member.
Because all database roles are members of the public
role , the results omit records for
implicit membership in the public role.

spanner_state

The current creation state of the table.
A table can go through multiple states during creation, if bulk

foreign key that requires backfilling of its referenced index. Possible
states are:
ADDING_FOREIGN_KEY : Adding the table's foreign keys
WAITING_FOR_COMMIT : Finalizing the schema change
COMMITTED : The schema change to create the table has
been committed. You cannot write to the table until the change is
committed.
NULL : Tables or views that are not base tables.
interleave_type
character varying
Whether there exists a parent-child relationship between this table and
the table it is interleaved in. Possible values are:
IN : An INTERLEAVE IN table that has
no parent-child
relationship. A row in this table can exist regardless of the
existence of its parent table row.
IN PARENT : An INTERLEAVE IN PARENT table
that has a
parent-child relationship. A row in this table requires the existence
of its parent table row.
