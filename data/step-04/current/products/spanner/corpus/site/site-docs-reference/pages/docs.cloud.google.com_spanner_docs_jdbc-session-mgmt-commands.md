JDBC session management commands (GoogleSQL)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Spanner JDBC driver (Java Database Connectivity) supports session
management statements, which let you modify the state of your connection,
execute transactions, and efficiently execute batches of statements.
The following commands apply to GoogleSQL-dialect databases.
Note: You can use session management statements only with the
Spanner JDBC driver. Session management statements don't work in the
client libraries, the Google Cloud CLI, or the JDBC driver created by Simba.
Connection statements
The following statements make changes to or display properties of the current
connection.
READONLY
A boolean indicating whether or not the connection is in read-only mode. The
default is false .
SHOW VARIABLE READONLY
SET READONLY = { true | false }
You can change the value of this property only while there is no active
transaction.
Example: Read-only transaction (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to use this property to execute read-only
transactions in Spanner.
SET READONLY = TRUE ;
-- This transaction is a read-only transaction.
BEGIN TRANSACTION ;
-- The following two queries both use the read-only transaction.
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
SELECT Title
FROM Albums
ORDER BY Title ;
-- This shows the read timestamp that was used for the two queries.
SHOW VARIABLE READ_TIMESTAMP ;
-- This marks the end of the read-only transaction. The next statement starts
-- a new read-only transaction.
COMMIT ;
AUTOCOMMIT
A boolean indicating whether or not the connection is in autocommit mode. The
default is true .
SHOW VARIABLE AUTOCOMMIT
SET AUTOCOMMIT = { true | false }
You can change the value of this property only when there is no active
transaction.
When AUTOCOMMIT is set to false, a new transaction is initiated automatically
after you execute COMMIT or ROLLBACK . The first statement that you execute
starts the transaction.
Example: Autocommit (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to use the `autocommit` property.
-- The default value for AUTOCOMMIT is true.
SHOW VARIABLE AUTOCOMMIT ;
-- This insert statement is automatically committed after it is executed, as
-- the connection is in autocommit mode.
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b ) VALUES ( 1 , 100 , 1 );
-- Turning off autocommit means that a new transaction is automatically started
-- when the next statement is executed.
SET AUTOCOMMIT = FALSE ;
-- The following statement starts a new transaction.
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b ) VALUES ( 2 , 200 , 2 );
-- This statement uses the same transaction as the previous statement.
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b ) VALUES ( 3 , 300 , 3 );
-- Commit the current transaction with the two INSERT statements.
COMMIT ;
-- Transactions can also be executed in autocommit mode by executing the BEGIN
-- statement.
SET AUTOCOMMIT = TRUE ;
-- Execute a transaction while in autocommit mode.
BEGIN ;
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b ) VALUES ( 4 , 400 , 4 );
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b ) VALUES ( 5 , 500 , 5 );
COMMIT ;
RETRY_ABORTS_INTERNALLY
A boolean indicating whether the connection automatically retries aborted
transactions. The default is true .
SHOW VARIABLE RETRY_ABORTS_INTERNALLY
SET RETRY_ABORTS_INTERNALLY = { true | false }
You can change the value of this property only after a transaction has started
(see BEGIN TRANSACTION ) and before
any statements are executed within the transaction.
When you set RETRY_ABORTS_INTERNALLY to true, the connection keeps a
checksum of all data that the connection returns to the client application. This
is used to retry the transaction if it is aborted by Spanner.
The default value is true . We recommend setting this value to false if your
application already retries aborted transactions.
AUTOCOMMIT_DML_MODE
A STRING property indicating the autocommit mode for
Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.
SHOW VARIABLE AUTOCOMMIT_DML_MODE
SET AUTOCOMMIT_DML_MODE = { 'TRANSACTIONAL' | 'PARTITIONED_NON_ATOMIC' }
The possible values are:
In TRANSACTIONAL mode, the driver executes DML statements as separate atomic
transactions. The driver creates a new transaction, executes the DML
statement, and either commits the transaction upon successful execution or
rolls back the transaction in the case of an error.
In PARTITIONED_NON_ATOMIC mode, the driver executes DML statements as
partitioned update statements . A partitioned
update statement can run as a series of many transactions, each covering a
subset of the rows impacted. The partitioned statement provides
weakened semantics in exchange for better scalability and performance.
The default is TRANSACTIONAL .
Example: Partitioned DML (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to execute
[Partitioned DML](/spanner/docs/dml-partitioned) using the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Change autocommit DML mode to use Partitioned DML.
SET AUTOCOMMIT_DML_MODE = 'PARTITIONED_NON_ATOMIC' ;
-- Delete all singers that have been marked as inactive.
-- This statement is executed using Partitioned DML.
DELETE
FROM singers
WHERE active = false ;
-- Change DML mode back to standard `TRANSACTIONAL`.
SET AUTOCOMMIT_DML_MODE = 'TRANSACTIONAL' ;
STATEMENT_TIMEOUT
A property of type STRING indicating the current timeout value for statements.
SHOW VARIABLE STATEMENT_TIMEOUT
SET STATEMENT_TIMEOUT = { '<INT64>{ s | ms | us | ns }' | NULL }
The INT64 value is a whole number followed by a suffix indicating the time
unit. A value of NULL indicates that there is no timeout value set. If a
statement timeout value has been set, statements that take longer than the
specified timeout value will cause a java.sql.SQLTimeoutException error and
invalidate the transaction.
The supported time units are:
s : seconds
ms : milliseconds
us : microseconds
ns : nanoseconds
The default is NULL , which means no timeout value is set.
A statement timeout during a transaction invalidates the transaction, all
subsequent statements in the invalidated transaction (except ROLLBACK ) fail,
and the Spanner JDBC driver throws a java.sql.SQLTimeoutException .
READ_ONLY_STALENESS
A property of type STRING indicating the current
read-only staleness setting that
Spanner uses for read-only transactions and queries in AUTOCOMMIT
mode.
SHOW VARIABLE READ_ONLY_STALENESS
SET READ_ONLY_STALENESS = staleness_type
staleness_type :
{ 'STRONG'
| 'MIN_READ_TIMESTAMP timestamp '
| 'READ_TIMESTAMP timestamp '
| 'MAX_STALENESS <INT64>{ s | ms | us | ns }'
| 'EXACT_STALENESS <INT64>{ s | ms | us | ns }' }
The read-only staleness value applies to all
subsequent read-only transactions and for all queries in AUTOCOMMIT mode.
The default is STRONG .
The timestamp bound options are as follows:
STRONG tells Spanner to perform a
strong read .
MAX_STALENESS defines the time interval Spanner uses to perform a
bounded staleness read ,
relative to now() .
MIN_READ_TIMESTAMP defines an absolute time Spanner uses to perform
a bounded staleness read .
EXACT_STALENESS defines the time interval Spanner uses to perform an
exact staleness read ,
relative to now() .
READ_TIMESTAMP defines an absolute time Spanner uses to perform an
exact staleness read.
Timestamps must use the following format:
YYYY - [M]M - [D]D T [[H]H:[M]M:[S]S[.DDDDDD]][timezone]
The supported time units for setting MAX_STALENESS and EXACT_STALENESS
values are:
s : seconds
ms : milliseconds
us : microseconds
ns : nanoseconds
You can modify the value of this property only while there is no active
transaction.
Note: You can use the values MIN_READ_TIMESTAMP and MAX_STALENESS only for
queries in AUTOCOMMIT mode.
Example: Read-only staleness (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to execute queries using a custom staleness
value with the Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Set the read-only staleness to MAX_STALENESS 10 seconds.
SET READ_ONLY_STALENESS = 'MAX_STALENESS 10s' ;
-- Execute a query in auto-commit mode. This returns results that are up to
-- 10 seconds stale.
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- Read-only staleness can also be applied to read-only transactions.
-- MAX_STALENESS is only allowed for queries in autocommit mode.
-- Change the staleness to EXACT_STALENESS and start a read-only transaction.
SET READ_ONLY_STALENESS = 'EXACT_STALENESS 10s' ;
BEGIN ;
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
SELECT Title , SingerId
FROM Albums
ORDER BY Title ;
COMMIT ;
-- Set the read staleness to an exact timestamp.
SET READ_ONLY_STALENESS = 'READ_TIMESTAMP 2024-01-26T10:36:00Z' ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
OPTIMIZER_VERSION
A property of type STRING indicating the
optimizer version . The version is
either an integer or ' LATEST '.
SHOW VARIABLE OPTIMIZER_VERSION
SET OPTIMIZER_VERSION = { 'version' | 'LATEST' | '' }
Sets the version of the optimizer to be used for all the following statements on
the connection. If the optimizer version is set to '' (the empty string), then
Spanner uses the latest version. If no optimizer version is set,
Spanner uses the optimizer version that is set at the database
level.
The default is '' .
Example: Optimizer version (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to execute queries using a specific
[optimizer version](/spanner/docs/query-optimizer/versions) with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Set the optimizer version to 5 and execute a query.
SET OPTIMIZER_VERSION = '5' ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- Execute the same query with the latest optimizer version.
SET OPTIMIZER_VERSION = 'LATEST' ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- Revert back to using the default optimizer version that has been set for the
-- database.
SET OPTIMIZER_VERSION = '' ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS_PACKAGE
A property of type STRING indicating the current
optimizer statistics package
that is used by this connection.
SHOW VARIABLE OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS_PACKAGE
SET OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS_PACKAGE = { 'package' | '' }
Sets the optimizer statistics package to use for all following statements on
the connection. <package> must be a valid package name. If no optimizer
statistics package is set, Spanner uses the optimizer statistics
package that is set at the database level.
The default is '' .
Example: Optimizer statistics package (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to execute queries using a specific
[optimizer statistics package](/spanner/docs/query-optimizer/versions) with
the Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Show the available optimizer statistics packages in this database.
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . SPANNER_STATISTICS ;
-- Set the optimizer statistics package and execute a query.
SET OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS_PACKAGE = 'auto_20240124_06_47_29UTC' ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- Execute the same query with the default optimizer statistics package.
SET OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS_PACKAGE = '' ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
RETURN_COMMIT_STATS
A property of type BOOL indicating whether statistics should be returned for
transactions on this connection. You can see returned statistics by executing
the SHOW VARIABLE COMMIT_RESPONSE command.
SHOW VARIABLE RETURN_COMMIT_STATS
SET RETURN_COMMIT_STATS = { true | false }
The default is false .
Example: Commit statistics (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to view commit statistics for a transaction
with the Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Enable the returning of commit stats.
SET RETURN_COMMIT_STATS = true ;
-- Execute a transaction.
BEGIN ;
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b )
VALUES ( 1 , 100 , 1 ), ( 2 , 200 , 2 ), ( 3 , 300 , 3 );
COMMIT ;
-- View the commit response with the transaction statistics for the last
-- transaction that was committed.
SHOW VARIABLE COMMIT_RESPONSE ;
RPC_PRIORITY
A property of type STRING indicating the relative priority for
Spanner requests. The priority acts as a hint to the
Spanner scheduler and doesn't guarantee order of execution.
SHOW VARIABLE RPC_PRIORITY
SET RPC_PRIORITY = { 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW' | 'NULL' }
'NULL' means that no hint should be included in the request.
The default is 'NULL' .
You can also use a statement hint to specify the RPC priority:
@ { RPC_PRIORITY = PRIORITY_LOW } SELECT * FROM Albums
For more information, see Priority .
Tags
The following statements manage request and transaction tags .
STATEMENT_TAG
A property of type STRING that contains the request tag for the next
statement.
SHOW VARIABLE STATEMENT_TAG
SET STATEMENT_TAG = 'tag-name'
Sets the request tag for the next statement to be executed. Only one
tag can be set per statement. The tag doesn't span multiple statements; it
must be set on a per statement basis. A request tag can be removed by setting it
to the empty string ( '' ).
The default is '' .
You can set both transaction tags and statement tags for the same statement.
You can also use a statement hint to add a statement tag:
@ { STATEMENT_TAG = 'my-tag' } SELECT * FROM Albums
For more information, see
Troubleshoot with request tags and transaction tags .
Example: Statement tags (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to set statement tags with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Set the statement tag that should be included with the next statement.
SET STATEMENT_TAG = 'tag1' ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- The statement tag property is cleared after each statement execution.
SHOW VARIABLE STATEMENT_TAG ;
-- Set another tag for the next statement.
SET STATEMENT_TAG = 'tag2' ;
SELECT Title
FROM Albums
ORDER BY Title ;
-- Set a statement tag with a query hint.
@ { STATEMENT_TAG = 'tag3' }
SELECT TrackNumber , Title
FROM Tracks
WHERE AlbumId = 1 AND SingerId = 1
ORDER BY TrackNumber ;
TRANSACTION_TAG
A property of type STRING that contains the transaction tag for the next
transaction.
SHOW VARIABLE TRANSACTION_TAG
SET TRANSACTION_TAG = 'tag-name'
Sets the transaction tag for the current transaction to be executed. Only one
tag can be set per transaction. The tag doesn't span multiple transactions; it
must be set on a per transaction basis. A transaction tag can be removed by
setting it to the empty string ( '' ). The transaction tag must be set before
any statements have been executed in the transaction.
The default is '' .
You can set both transaction tags and statement tags for the same statement.
For more information, see
Troubleshoot with request tags and transaction tags .
Example: Transaction tags (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to set transaction tags with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
BEGIN ;
-- Set the transaction tag for the current transaction.
SET TRANSACTION_TAG = 'transaction-tag-1' ;
-- Set the statement tag that should be included with the next statement.
-- The statement will include both the statement tag and the transaction tag.
SET STATEMENT_TAG = 'select-statement' ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- The statement tag property is cleared after each statement execution.
SHOW VARIABLE STATEMENT_TAG ;
-- Set another tag for the next statement.
SET STATEMENT_TAG = 'insert-statement' ;
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b )
VALUES ( 1 , 100 , 1 );
COMMIT ;
-- The transaction tag property is cleared when the transaction finishes.
SHOW VARIABLE TRANSACTION_TAG ;
Transaction statements
The following statements manage and commit Spanner transactions.
READ_TIMESTAMP
SHOW VARIABLE READ_TIMESTAMP
Returns a result set with one row and one column of type TIMESTAMP containing
the read timestamp of the most recent read-only transaction. This statement
returns a timestamp only when either a read-only transaction is still active and
has executed at least one query, or immediately after a read-only transaction is
committed and before a new transaction starts. Otherwise, the result is NULL .
Example: Read timestamp (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to view the last read timestamp for a
read-only operation with the Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Execute a query in autocommit mode using the default read-only staleness
-- (strong).
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- Show the read timestamp that was used for the previous query.
SHOW VARIABLE READ_TIMESTAMP ;
-- Set a non-deterministic read-only staleness and execute the same query.
SET READ_ONLY_STALENESS = 'MAX_STALENESS 20s' ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- Show the read timestamp that was used for the previous query. The timestamp
-- is determined by Spanner, and is guaranteed to be no less than
-- 20 seconds stale.
SHOW VARIABLE READ_TIMESTAMP ;
-- The read timestamp of a read-only transaction can also be retrieved.
SET READ_ONLY_STALENESS = 'STRONG' ;
BEGIN ;
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- Show the read timestamp of the current read-only transaction. All queries in
-- this transaction will use this read timestamp.
SHOW VARIABLE READ_TIMESTAMP ;
SELECT Title
FROM Albums
ORDER BY Title ;
-- The read timestamp is the same as for the previous query, as all queries in
-- the same transaction use the same read timestamp.
SHOW VARIABLE READ_TIMESTAMP ;
COMMIT ;
COMMIT_TIMESTAMP
SHOW VARIABLE COMMIT_TIMESTAMP
Returns a result set with one row and one column of type TIMESTAMP containing
the commit timestamp of the last read-write transaction that
Spanner committed. This statement returns a timestamp only when
you execute it after you commit a read-write transaction and before you execute
any subsequent SELECT , DML , or schema change statements. Otherwise, the
result is NULL .
Example: Commit timestamp (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to view the last commit timestamp for a
write operation with the Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Execute a DML statement.
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b )
VALUES ( 1 , 100 , 1 ), ( 2 , 200 , 2 ), ( 3 , 300 , 3 );
-- Show the timestamp that the statement was committed.
SHOW VARIABLE COMMIT_TIMESTAMP ;
COMMIT_RESPONSE
SHOW VARIABLE COMMIT_RESPONSE
Returns a result set with one row and two columns:
COMMIT_TIMESTAMP (type= TIMESTAMP ) indicates when the most recent
transaction was committed.
MUTATION_COUNT (type= INT64 ) indicates how many mutations were applied in
the committed transaction. This value is always empty when executed on the
emulator.
The mutation count is available only if SET RETURN_COMMIT_STATS was
set to true prior to the transaction commit.
Example: Commit response (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to view the last commit response for a
write operation with the Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Enable returning commit stats in addition to the commit timestamp.
SET RETURN_COMMIT_STATS = true ;
-- Execute a DML statement.
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b )
VALUES ( 1 , 100 , 1 ), ( 2 , 200 , 2 ), ( 3 , 300 , 3 );
-- Show the timestamp that the statement was committed.
SHOW VARIABLE COMMIT_RESPONSE ;
BEGIN [TRANSACTION]
BEGIN [ TRANSACTION ]
Starts a new transaction. The keyword TRANSACTION is optional.
Use COMMIT or ROLLBACK to terminate a transaction.
If you have enabled AUTOCOMMIT mode , this statement
temporarily takes the connection out of AUTOCOMMIT mode. The connection
returns to AUTOCOMMIT mode when the transaction ends.
The transaction mode is determined by the current READONLY setting for this
connection. This value is set by using the SET READONLY = {TRUE | FALSE}
command.
The transaction mode can be changed by executing SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY
or SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE directly after executing
BEGIN [TRANSACTION] .
You can execute this statement only while there is no active transaction.
Example: BEGIN TRANSACTION (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to start different types of transactions with
the Spanner JDBC driver.
-- This starts a transaction using the current defaults of this connection.
-- The value of READONLY determines whether the transaction is a
-- read-write or a read-only transaction.
BEGIN ;
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b )
VALUES ( 1 , 100 , 1 );
COMMIT ;
-- Set READONLY to TRUE to use read-only transactions by default.
SET READONLY = TRUE ;
-- This starts a read-only transaction.
BEGIN ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
COMMIT ;
-- Execute 'SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE' or 'SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY' directly
-- after the BEGIN statement to override the current default of the connection.
SET READONLY = FALSE ;
BEGIN ;
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
COMMIT ;
COMMIT [TRANSACTION]
COMMIT [ TRANSACTION ]
Commits the current transaction. The keyword TRANSACTION is optional.
Committing a read-write transaction makes all updates of this transaction
visible to other transactions and releases all of the transaction's locks on
Spanner.
Committing a read-only transaction ends the current read-only transaction. Any
subsequent statement starts a new transaction. There is no semantic difference
between COMMIT and ROLLBACK for a read-only transaction.
You can execute this statement only while there is an active transaction.
Example: COMMIT TRANSACTION (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to commit a transaction with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Execute a regular read-write transaction.
BEGIN ;
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b )
VALUES ( 1 , 100 , 1 );
COMMIT ;
-- Execute a read-only transaction. Read-only transactions also need to be
-- either committed or rolled back in the Spanner JDBC driver in order
-- to mark the end of the transaction.
BEGIN ;
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
COMMIT ;
ROLLBACK [TRANSACTION]
ROLLBACK [ TRANSACTION ]
Performs a ROLLBACK of the current transaction. The keywords TRANSACTION is
optional.
Performing a ROLLBACK of a read-write transaction clears any buffered
mutations, rolls back the transaction on Spanner, and releases
any locks the transaction held.
Performing a ROLLBACK of a read-only transaction ends the current read-only
transaction. Any subsequent statements start a new transaction. There is no
semantic difference between COMMIT and ROLLBACK for a read-only
transaction on a connection.
You can execute this statement only while there is an active transaction.
Example: ROLLBACK TRANSACTION (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to rollback a transaction with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Use ROLLBACK to undo the effects of a transaction.
BEGIN ;
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b )
VALUES ( 1 , 100 , 1 );
-- This ensures that the insert statement is not persisted in the database.
ROLLBACK ;
-- Read-only transactions also need to be either committed or rolled back in the
-- Spanner JDBC driver in order to mark the end of the transaction.
-- There is no semantic difference between rolling back or committing a
-- read-only transaction.
BEGIN ;
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
ROLLBACK ;
SET TRANSACTION
SET TRANSACTION { READ ONLY | READ WRITE }
Sets the transaction mode for the current transaction.
You can execute this statement only when AUTOCOMMIT is false , or if you have
started a transaction by executing BEGIN [TRANSACTION] and have not yet
executed any statements in the transaction.
This statement sets the transaction mode for the current transaction only. When
the transaction commits or rolls back, the next transaction uses the default
mode for the connection (see SET READONLY ).
Note: You can't set the transaction mode to READ WRITE if the connection is
in READ ONLY mode.
Example: SET TRANSACTION (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to set transaction characteristics with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Start a transaction and set the transaction mode to read-only.
BEGIN ;
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY ;
SELECT FirstName , LastName
FROM Singers
ORDER BY LastName ;
-- Commit the read-only transaction to mark the end of the transaction.
COMMIT ;
-- Start a transaction and set the transaction mode to read-write.
BEGIN ;
SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE ;
INSERT INTO T ( id , col_a , col_b )
VALUES ( 1 , 100 , 1 );
COMMIT ;
Batch statements
The following statements manage batches of DDL statements and send those batches
to Spanner.
START BATCH DDL
START BATCH DDL
Starts a batch of DDL statements on the connection. All subsequent statements
during the batch must be DDL statements. The DDL statements are buffered locally
and sent to Spanner as one batch when you execute RUN BATCH .
Executing multiple DDL statements as one batch is typically faster than running
the statements separately.
You can execute this statement only while there is no active transaction.
Example: DDL batch (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to execute a DDL batch with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Start a DDL batch. All following statements must be DDL statements.
START BATCH DDL ;
-- This statement is buffered locally until RUN BATCH is executed.
CREATE TABLE Singers (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
FirstName STRING ( MAX ),
LastName STRING ( MAX )
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId );
-- This statement is buffered locally until RUN BATCH is executed.
CREATE TABLE Albums (
AlbumId INT64 NOT NULL ,
Title STRING ( MAX ),
SingerId INT64 ,
CONSTRAINT fk_albums_singers FOREIGN KEY ( SingerId ) REFERENCES Singers ( SingerId )
) PRIMARY KEY ( AlbumId );
-- This runs the DDL statements as one batch.
RUN BATCH ;
RUN BATCH
RUN BATCH
Sends all buffered DDL statements in the current DDL batch to the database,
waits for Spanner to execute these statements, and ends the
current DDL batch.
If Spanner cannot execute at least one DDL statement, RUN BATCH
returns an error for the first DDL statement that Spanner cannot
execute. Otherwise, RUN BATCH returns successfully.
Note: If a DDL statement in the batch returns an error, Spanner
might still have applied the preceding DDL statements in the same batch to the
database.
ABORT BATCH [TRANSACTION]
Clears all buffered DDL statements in the current DDL batch and ends the batch.
You can execute this statement only when a DDL batch is active. You can use
ABORT BATCH regardless of whether or not the batch has buffered DDL
statements. All preceding DDL statements in the batch will be aborted.
Example: Abort DDL batch (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to abort a DDL batch with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Start a DDL batch. All following statements must be DDL statements.
START BATCH DDL ;
-- The following statements are buffered locally.
CREATE TABLE Singers (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
FirstName STRING ( MAX ),
LastName STRING ( MAX )
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId );
CREATE TABLE Albums (
AlbumId INT64 NOT NULL ,
Title STRING ( MAX ),
SingerId INT64 ,
CONSTRAINT fk_albums_singers FOREIGN KEY ( SingerId ) REFERENCES Singers ( SingerId )
) PRIMARY KEY ( AlbumId );
-- This aborts the DDL batch and removes the DDL statements from the buffer.
ABORT BATCH ;
START BATCH DML and RUN Batch
The following statements batch the two DML statements together and send these in
one call to the server. A DML batch can be executed as part of a transaction or
in autocommit mode.
START BATCH DML ;
INSERT INTO MYTABLE ( ID , NAME ) VALUES ( 1 , 'ONE' );
INSERT INTO MYTABLE ( ID , NAME ) VALUES ( 2 , 'TWO' );
RUN BATCH ;
Example: DML batch (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to execute a DML batch with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Start a DML batch. All following statements must be a DML statement.
START BATCH DML ;
-- The following statements are buffered locally.
INSERT INTO MYTABLE ( ID , NAME ) VALUES ( 1 , 'ONE' );
INSERT INTO MYTABLE ( ID , NAME ) VALUES ( 2 , 'TWO' );
-- This sends the statements to Spanner.
RUN BATCH ;
-- DML batches can also be part of a read/write transaction.
BEGIN ;
-- Insert a row using a single statement.
INSERT INTO MYTABLE ( ID , NAME ) VALUES ( 3 , 'THREE' );
-- Insert two rows using a batch.
START BATCH DML ;
INSERT INTO MYTABLE ( ID , NAME ) VALUES ( 4 , 'FOUR' );
INSERT INTO MYTABLE ( ID , NAME ) VALUES ( 5 , 'FIVE' );
RUN BATCH ;
-- Rollback the current transaction. This rolls back both the single DML
-- statement and the DML batch.
ROLLBACK ;
Data Boost and partitioned query statements
The partitionQuery
API divides a query into smaller pieces, or partitions, and uses multiple
machines to fetch the partitions in parallel. Each partition is identified by a
partition token. The PartitionQuery API has higher latency than the standard
query API, because it is only intended for bulk operations such as exporting or
scanning the whole database.
Data Boost for Spanner
lets you execute analytics queries and data exports with near-zero
impact to existing workloads on the provisioned Spanner instance.
Data Boost only supports partitioned queries .
You can enable Data Boost with the SET DATA_BOOST_ENABLED statement.
The Spanner JDBC driver supports three alternatives for executing
partitioned queries:
SET AUTO_PARTITION_MODE = true
RUN PARTITIONED QUERY sql
PARTITION sql followed by multiple RUN PARTITION 'partition-token'
Each of these methods are described in the following sections.
DATA_BOOST_ENABLED
A property of type BOOL indicating whether this connection should use
Data Boost for partitioned queries. The default
is false .
SHOW VARIABLE DATA_BOOST_ENABLED
SET DATA_BOOST_ENABLED = { true | false }
Example: Execute a query using Data Boost (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to a query using Data Boost with the
Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Enable Data Boost on this connection.
SET DATA_BOOST_ENABLED = true ;
-- Execute a partitioned query. Data Boost is only used for partitioned queries.
RUN PARTITIONED QUERY SELECT FirstName , LastName FROM Singers ;
For a full example, see DataBoostExample.
AUTO_PARTITION_MODE
A property of type BOOL indicating whether the connection automatically uses
partitioned queries for all queries that are executed.
SHOW VARIABLE AUTO_PARTITION_MODE
SET AUTO_PARTITION_MODE = { true | false }
Set this variable to true if you want the connection to use
partitioned query for all queries that are executed.
Also set DATA_BOOST_ENABLED to true if you want the
connection to use Data Boost for all
queries.
The default is false .
Example: Execute (Click to expand)
This example executes two queries with the Spanner JDBC driver using
[Data Boost](/spanner/docs/databoost/databoost-overview)
SET AUTO_PARTITION_MODE = true
SET DATA_BOOST_ENABLED = true
SELECT FirstName , LastName FROM Singers
SELECT SingerId , Title FROM Albums
For a full example, see
AutoPartitionModeExample.
RUN PARTITIONED QUERY
RUN PARTITIONED QUERY < sql >
Executes a query as a partitioned query on Spanner. Ensure that
DATA_BOOST_ENABLED is set to true to execute the query with
Data Boost :
SET DATA_BOOST_ENABLED = true
RUN PARTITIONED QUERY SELECT FirstName , LastName FROM Singers
The Spanner JDBC driver internally partitions the query and executes
partitions in parallel. The results are merged into one result set and returned
to the application. The number of worker threads executing partitions can be set
with the variable MAX_PARTITIONED_PARALLELISM .
For a full example, see
RunPartitionedQueryExample.
PARTITION <SQL>
PARTITION < sql >
Creates a list of partitions to execute a query against Spanner
and returns these a list of partition tokens. Each partition token can be
executed on a separate connection on the same or another client using the
RUN PARTITION 'partition-token' command.
Example: Partition query (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to partition a query and then execute each
partition separately using the Spanner JDBC driver.
-- Partition a query. This returns a list of partition tokens that can be
-- executed either on this connection or on any other connection to the same
-- database.
PARTITION SELECT FirstName , LastName FROM Singers ;
-- Run the partitions that were returned from the previous statement.
RUN PARTITION 'partition-token-1' ;
RUN PARTITION 'partition-token-2' ;
For a full example, see
PartitionQueryExample.
RUN PARTITION 'partition-token'
RUN PARTITION 'partition-token'
Executes a query partition that has previously been returned by the PARTITION
command. The command can be executed on any connection that is connected to
the same database as the database that created the partition tokens.
MAX_PARTITIONED_PARALLELISM
A property of type INT64 indicating the number of worker threads the
Spanner JDBC driver uses to execute partitions. This value is used for:
AUTO_PARTITION_MODE = true
RUN PARTITIONED QUERY sql
SHOW VARIABLE MAX_PARTITIONED_PARALLELISM
SET MAX_PARTITIONED_PARALLELISM = < INT64 >
Sets the maximum number of worker threads that the Spanner JDBC driver
can use to execute partitions. Setting this value to 0 instructs the
Spanner JDBC driver to use the number of CPU cores on the client
machine as the maximum.
The default is 0 .
Directed read statements
A property of type STRING that sets the directed read option for the following
statements.
SHOW VARIABLE DIRECTED_READ
SET DIRECTED_READ = '{"includeReplicas":{"replicaSelections":[{"location":"<location-name>"}]}}'
For more information, see
Directed reads .
Savepoint commands
The following statements enable and disable emulated
savepoints
in transactions. You can create a savepoint by calling the
java.sql.Connection#setSavepoint()
method.
The Spanner JDBC driver emulates savepoints to support frameworks that
rely on these for nested transactions. Savepoints are emulated by keeping track
of a running checksum for the results that have been returned by statements in
the transaction. When rolling back to a savepoint, the
Spanner JDBC driver rolls back the transaction, and then retries the
transaction up to the point where the savepoint was set. The checksum of the
retry is compared to the checksum of the initial transaction to verify that the
same results were returned.
SAVEPOINT_SUPPORT
SHOW VARIABLE SAVEPOINT_SUPPORT
SET SAVEPOINT_SUPPORT = { 'DISABLED' | 'FAIL_AFTER_ROLLBACK' | 'ENABLED' }
A property of type STRING indicating the current SAVEPOINT_SUPPORT
configuration. Possible values are:
DISABLED : All savepoint commands are disabled and will fail.
FAIL_AFTER_ROLLBACK : Savepoint commands are enabled. Rolling back to a
savepoint rolls back the entire transaction. The transaction fails if you try
to use the transaction after rolling back to a savepoint.
ENABLED : All savepoint commands are enabled. Rolling back to a savepoint
will rollback the transaction and retry is performed to the savepoint. This
operation fails with an AbortedDueToConcurrentModificationException error if
the underlying data that has been used by the transaction up to the savepoint
has changed.
The default value is FAIL_AFTER_ROLLBACK .
You can change the value of this variable only while there is no active
transaction.
Example: Savepoint support (Click to expand)
The following example shows how to enable and disable savepoints support in
the Spanner JDBC driver.
try ( Connection connection =
DriverManager . getConnection (
String . format (
"jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/%s/instances/%s/databases/%s" ,
"my-project" , "my-instance" , "my-database" ))) {
// Savepoints can only be used when AutoCommit=false.
connection . setAutoCommit ( false );
// Disables setting a savepoint.
connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SAVEPOINT_SUPPORT='DISABLED'" );
// The following statement fails because savepoints have been disabled.
connection . setSavepoint ( "my_savepoint1" );
// Enables setting a savepoint and releasing a savepoint.
// Rolling back to a savepoint is disabled.
connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SAVEPOINT_SUPPORT='FAIL_AFTER_ROLLBACK'" );
Savepoint mySavepoint2 = connection . setSavepoint ( "my_savepoint2" );
connection . createStatement (). execute ( "insert into my_table (id, value) values (1, 'One')" );
connection . releaseSavepoint ( mySavepoint2 );
connection . commit ();
// Enables setting, releasing and rolling back to a savepoint.
connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SAVEPOINT_SUPPORT='ENABLED'" );
Savepoint mySavepoint3 = connection . setSavepoint ( "my_savepoint3" );
connection . createStatement (). execute ( "insert into my_table (id, value) values (2, 'Two')" );
connection . rollback ( mySavepoint3 );
}
