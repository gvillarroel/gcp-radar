Use the open-source R2DBC driver
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
R2DBC
is a specification for non-blocking access to relational databases, based on
Reactive Streams .
Your application can make use of the reactive database connectivity with
Spanner by using the Spanner R2DBC driver.
Add dependencies
Spring Data users should use the Spring Data R2DBC dialect for
Spanner; all other users should bring in the
Spanner R2DBC driver only.
Use the Spanner R2DBC driver
To add only the Spanner R2DBC driver to your application, add the
following dependency:
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>cloud-spanner-r2dbc</artifactId>
<version>1.3.0</version>
</dependency>
For more information, see the Spanner R2DBC
driver GitHub repository
and the sample code .
Use the Spring Data R2DBC dialect for Spanner
For users of the Spring Framework, Spring Data provides familiar abstractions
to simplify interaction with common database operations.
To use Spring Data R2DBC features
with Spanner, add the following dependency to your project. The
driver is a transitive dependency of the dialect.
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>cloud-spanner-spring-data-r2dbc</artifactId>
<version>1.2.2</version>
</dependency>
To learn how to use its template and repositories, see the
Spring Data R2DBC reference .
To see which objects are automatically configured for your, see the Spring Boot reference .
For more information, see the Spanner Spring Data R2DBC
GitHub repository .
Spring Boot configuration
Regardless of which R2DBC dependency you use, if your application is based on
Spring Boot, the framework will attempt to automatically configure and provide a
connection factory for you.
Provide a spring.r2dbc.url property to let autoconfiguration take care of
R2DBC connection factory configuration. The format is shown in the following
sample application.properties entry:
spring.r2dbc.url = \
r2dbc:cloudspanner://spanner.googleapis.com:443/projects/${project}/instances/${instance}/databases/${database}
