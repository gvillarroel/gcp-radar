Database schema
The queries and execution plans on this page are based on the following database
schema:
CREATE TABLE Singers (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
FirstName STRING ( 1024 ),
LastName STRING ( 1024 ),
SingerInfo BYTES ( MAX ),
BirthDate DATE
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId );
CREATE INDEX SingersByFirstLastName ON Singers ( FirstName , LastName );
CREATE TABLE Albums (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
AlbumId INT64 NOT NULL ,
AlbumTitle STRING ( MAX ),
MarketingBudget INT64
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId , AlbumId ),
INTERLEAVE IN PARENT Singers ON DELETE CASCADE ;
CREATE INDEX AlbumsByAlbumTitle ON Albums ( AlbumTitle );
CREATE INDEX AlbumsByAlbumTitle2 ON Albums ( AlbumTitle ) STORING ( MarketingBudget );
CREATE TABLE Songs (
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
AlbumId INT64 NOT NULL ,
TrackId INT64 NOT NULL ,
SongName STRING ( MAX ),
Duration INT64 ,
SongGenre STRING ( 25 )
) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId , AlbumId , TrackId ),
INTERLEAVE IN PARENT Albums ON DELETE CASCADE ;
CREATE INDEX SongsBySingerAlbumSongNameDesc ON Songs ( SingerId , AlbumId , SongName DESC ), INTERLEAVE IN Albums ;
CREATE INDEX SongsBySongName ON Songs ( SongName );
CREATE TABLE Concerts (
VenueId INT64 NOT NULL ,
SingerId INT64 NOT NULL ,
ConcertDate DATE NOT NULL ,
BeginTime TIMESTAMP ,

) PRIMARY KEY ( VenueId , SingerId , ConcertDate );
You can use the following Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements to add
data to these tables:
INSERT INTO Singers ( SingerId , FirstName , LastName , BirthDate )
VALUES ( 1 , "Marc" , "Richards" , "1970-09-03" ),
( 2 , "Catalina" , "Smith" , "1990-08-17" ),
( 3 , "Alice" , "Trentor" , "1991-10-02" ),
( 4 , "Lea" , "Martin" , "1991-11-09" ),
( 5 , "David" , "Lomond" , "1977-01-29" );
INSERT INTO Albums ( SingerId , AlbumId , AlbumTitle )
VALUES ( 1 , 1 , "Total Junk" ),
( 1 , 2 , "Go, Go, Go" ),
( 2 , 1 , "Green" ),
( 2 , 2 , "Forever Hold Your Peace" ),
( 2 , 3 , "Terrified" ),
( 3 , 1 , "Nothing To Do With Me" ),
( 4 , 1 , "Play" );
INSERT INTO Songs ( SingerId , AlbumId , TrackId , SongName , Duration , SongGenre )
VALUES ( 2 , 1 , 1 , "Let's Get Back Together" , 182 , "COUNTRY" ),

( 2 , 3 , 1 , "Fight Story" , 194 , "ROCK" ),
( 3 , 1 , 1 , "Not About The Guitar" , 278 , "BLUES" );
Note: You can run queries and retrieve execution plans even if the tables have
no data.
Array unnest
An array unnest operator flattens an input array into rows of elements. Each
resulting row contains up to two columns: the value from the array and the
optional zero-based position in the array.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT a , b FROM UNNEST ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) a WITH OFFSET b ;
/*---+---+
| a | b |
+---+---+
| 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 |
+---+---*/
The query flattens the array [1,2,3] in column a and shows the array
position in column b .
The execution plan appears as follows:

Scan
A scan operator scans a source of rows and returns them. These are the types
of scan operators:
Table scan : Scans a table.
Index scan : Scans an index.
Batch scan : Scans occur on intermediate tables created by other
relational operators (for example, a table created by a
distributed cross apply ).
Whenever possible, Spanner applies predicates on keys as part of
a scan. Scans execute more efficiently when Spanner applies
predicates, because the scan does not need to read the entire table or index.
Predicates appear in the execution plan as:
Seekable condition: The seekable condition applies if Spanner
can determine a specific row to access in the table. In general, this
happens when the filter is on a prefix of the primary key. For example, if
the primary key consists of Col1 and Col2 , then a WHERE clause that
includes explicit values for Col1 , or Col1 and Col2 is seekable. In
that case, Spanner reads data only within the key range.
If a query must look up all rows in a table, a full scan occurs, which appears
in the execution plan as full scan: true .
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT s . lastname
FROM singers @{ FORCE_INDEX = SingersByFirstLastName } as s
WHERE s . firstname = 'Catalina' ;
/*----------+
| LastName |
+----------+
| Smith |
+----------*/
The execution plan segment appears as follows:
In the execution plan, the top-level distributed union
operator sends subplans to remote servers. Each subplan has a
serialize result
operator and an index scan operator. The predicate
Key Predicate: FirstName = 'Catalina' restricts the scan to rows in the index
SingersByFirstLastname that have FirstName equal to Catalina . The index
scan returns the output to the serialize result operator.
Spanner tightly couples scans with Filter Scan
and considers them a single operator. If there is no Seek Condition , the
operator shows as Full Scan.
Properties and execution statistics
A property of an operator describes a trait that is used when the operator is
executed. An execution statistic is a value collected during query execution
to help you assess performance of the operator.
The Scan operator has additional distinct properties and execution statistics.
Properties
Name
Description
Scan method
Can be Row , Batch , or
Automatic . In Row execution, the operator processes one
row at a time. In Batch execution, the operator processes a batch of rows
at once. In Automatic execution, the operator starts scanning using the
Row method but can change to Batch
when needed.
Seek condition
A predicate on the primary key used to perform efficient lookups of a
table. This property means that the entire table doesn't need to be
scanned to produce the wanted set of rows. This property is only
applicable to Table Scans and Index Scans .
Variable assignment
List of the columns read from the table.
Execution method
In Row execution, the operator processes one row at a time.
In Batch execution, the operator processes a batch of rows at once.
Execution statistics
Name
Description
Scanned rows
The number of rows read during scan.
Seek count
The number of look-ups or seeks performed by this Scan Operator.
Latency
Elapsed time of all the executions done in the operator.
Cumulative latency
The total time of the current operator and its descendants.
CPU time
Sum of CPU time spent executing the operator.
Cumulative CPU time
The total CPU time spent executing the operator and its descendants.
Execution time
The total amount of time taken to run the query and process results.
Rows returned
The number of rows output by this operator
Number of executions
The number of times the operator was executed. Some executions can run
in parallel.
Filter scan
A filter scan operator always appears on top of a table or index scan .
It works with the scan to reduce the number of rows read from the database, and
the resulting scan is typically faster than with a
filter .
Spanner applies the filter scan in certain conditions:
Residual condition: Any other condition where Spanner can
evaluate the scan to limit the amount of data read.
The following query demonstrates this operator:
SELECT lastname
FROM singers
WHERE singerid = 1
/*----------+
| LastName |
+----------+
| Richards |
+----------*/
The execution plan appears as follows:
