Spanner client libraries
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows how to get started with the Cloud Client Libraries for the
Cloud Spanner API. Client libraries make it easier to access
Google Cloud APIs from a supported language. Although you can use
Google Cloud APIs directly by making raw requests to the server, client
libraries provide simplifications that significantly reduce the amount of code
you need to write.
Read more about the Cloud Client Libraries
and the older Google API Client Libraries in
Client libraries explained .
Spanner provides client libraries for popular programming languages,
including C++, C#, Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. The client
libraries connect to the Spanner service using gRPC over a
TLS-encrypted HTTP/2 connection, so you don't need to manually configure SSL or
TLS.
The Spanner client libraries are supported on Compute Engine,
App Engine flexible environment, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Cloud Run functions.
The Spanner client library for Java is also supported on
App Engine standard environment with Java 8.
If you are using the App Engine standard environment with Go, PHP, or
Python, use the REST interface to access
Spanner.
Note: Additional client libraries are available for Java
applications.
Install the client library
C++
For more information about installing the C++ library,
see the Setting up a C++ development environment guide.
C#
To install the Google.Cloud.Spanner.Data client library in Visual Studio,
do the following:
Right-click your solution in Visual Studio and select
Manage Nuget packages for solution .
Select the Include prerelease checkbox.
Search for and install the package named Google.Cloud.Spanner.Data .
For more information, see Setting Up a C# Development Environment .
Go
go get cloud.google.com/go/spanner/...
For more information, see Setting Up a Go Development Environment .
Java
Note: If your application uses the Spring Framework, a
Spring Data module is also available.
If you are using Maven , add
the following to your pom.xml file. For more information about
BOMs, see The Google Cloud Platform Libraries BOM .
< dependencyManagement >
< dependencies >

If you are using Gradle ,
add the following to your dependencies:
implementation platform ( ' com . google . cloud : libraries - bom : 26.78.0 ' )
implementation ' com . google . cloud : google - cloud - spanner '
If you are using sbt , add
the following to your dependencies:
libraryDependencies += "com.google.cloud" % "google-cloud-spanner" % "6.113.0"
If you're using Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ, you can add client libraries to your
project using the following IDE plugins:
Cloud Code for VS Code
Cloud Code for IntelliJ
The plugins provide additional functionality, such as key management for service accounts. Refer
to each plugin's documentation for details.
Note: Cloud Java client libraries do not currently support Android.
For more information, see Setting Up a Java Development Environment .
Node.js
npm install @google-cloud/spanner
For more information, see Setting Up a Node.js Development Environment .
PHP
composer require google/cloud-spanner
Note: The Spanner Client Library requires that you install and enable
the gRPC extension for PHP.
For more information, see Using PHP on Google Cloud .
Python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-spanner
For more information, see Setting Up a Python Development Environment .
Ruby
gem install google-cloud-spanner
For more information, see Setting Up a Ruby Development Environment .
Set up authentication
To authenticate calls to Google Cloud APIs, client libraries support
Application Default Credentials (ADC) ;
the libraries look for credentials in a set of defined locations and use those credentials
to authenticate requests to the API. With ADC, you can make
credentials available to your application in a variety of environments, such as local
development or production, without needing to modify your application code.
For production environments, the way you set up ADC depends on the service
and context. For more information, see Set up Application Default Credentials .
For a local development environment, you can set up ADC with the credentials
that are associated with your Google Account:
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
A sign-in screen appears. After you sign in, your credentials are stored in the
local credential file used by ADC .
Use the client library
The following example shows how to use the client library.
