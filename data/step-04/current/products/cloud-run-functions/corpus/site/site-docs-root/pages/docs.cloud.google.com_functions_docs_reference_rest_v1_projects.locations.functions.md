maxInstances
integer
The limit on the maximum number of function instances that may coexist at a given time.
In some cases, such as rapid traffic surges, Cloud Functions may, for a short period of time, create more instances than the specified max instances limit. If your function cannot tolerate this temporary behavior, you may want to factor in a safety margin and set a lower max instances value than your function can tolerate.
See the Max Instances Guide for more details.
minInstances
integer
A lower bound for the number function instances that may coexist at a given time.
vpcConnector
string
The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to. It can be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name of the network connector resource. The format of this field is projects/*/locations/*/connectors/*
This field is mutually exclusive with network field and will eventually replace it.
See the VPC documentation for more information on connecting Cloud projects.

It must match the pattern projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{key_ring}/cryptoKeys/{crypto_key} .
If specified, you must also provide an artifact registry repository using the dockerRepository field that was created with the same KMS crypto key.
The following service accounts need to be granted the role 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter (roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter)' on the Key/KeyRing/Project/Organization (least access preferred).
Google Cloud Functions service account (service-{project_number}@gcf-admin-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com) - Required to protect the function's image.
Google Storage service account (service-{project_number}@gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com) - Required to protect the function's source code. If this service account does not exist, deploying a function without a KMS key or retrieving the service agent name provisions it. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects#service-agents and https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-service-agent#gsutil .
Google Cloud Functions delegates access to service agents to protect function resources in internal projects that are not accessible by the end user.

Fields
eventType
string
Required. The type of event to observe. For example: providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change and providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish .
Event types match pattern providers/*/eventTypes/*.* . The pattern contains:
namespace: For example, cloud.storage and google.firebase.analytics .
resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type object .
action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for a Google Cloud Storage Object is 'change'. These parts are lower case.
resource
string
Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for example, projects/_/buckets/myBucket .
Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For example:
The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the same project as the CloudFunction .
The resource type must match the pattern expected for an eventType . For example, an EventTrigger that has an eventType of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.
Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an EventTrigger . These will always be returned in the normalized "long" format.
See each service's documentation for supported formats.

secret
string
Name of the secret in secret manager (not the full resource name).
version
string
Version of the secret (version number or the string 'latest'). It is recommended to use a numeric version for secret environment variables as any updates to the secret value is not reflected until new instances start.
SecretVolume
Configuration for a secret volume. It has the information necessary to fetch the secret value from secret manager and make it available as files mounted at the requested paths within the application container. Secret value is not a part of the configuration. Every filesystem read operation performs a lookup in secret manager to retrieve the secret value.

"secret" : string ,
"versions" : [
{
object ( SecretVersion )
}
]
}

Configuration for a single version.
JSON representation
{
"version" : string ,
"path" : string
}
Fields
version
string
Version of the secret (version number or the string 'latest'). It is preferable to use latest version with secret volumes as secret value changes are reflected immediately.
path
string
Relative path of the file under the mount path where the secret value for this version will be fetched and made available. For example, setting the mountPath as '/etc/secrets' and path as /secret_foo would mount the secret value file at /etc/secrets/secret_foo .
