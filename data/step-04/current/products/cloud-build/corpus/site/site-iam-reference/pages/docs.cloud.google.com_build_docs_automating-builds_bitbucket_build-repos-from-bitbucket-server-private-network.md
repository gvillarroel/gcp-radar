Build repositories from Bitbucket Server in a private network
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud Build enables you to create triggers to build from
repositories hosted on Bitbucket Server , allowing you to execute builds
in response to events such as commit pushes or pull requests associated with your Bitbucket Server repository.
This page explains how you can enable trigger functionality on a
Bitbucket Server instance if your instance is hosted in a private network.
Before you begin
Enable the Cloud Build, Secret Manager, Compute Engine, and Service Networking APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
If you have not created a private pool, follow the instructions in
Create and manage private pools
to create a private pool. You will need a private pool to
build in a private network.
Building repositories from Bitbucket Server in a private network
If your Bitbucket Server instance is hosted in a private network
and not reachable over a public internet connection,
you must create a private connection between
your VPC
network and the service producer network . You
also need a private pool to build in a private network.
To create a Bitbucket Server trigger to build in a private network:
Create a private connection between the VPC network
and your service producer network by completing the following steps:
Create a new VPC network or select an existing VPC network .
Note: You must configure your VPC network to have access to your Bitbucket Server instance in a private network.
Allocate a named IP range in the VPC network for your peered network.
Allocate an internal IP range in the VPC that the Cloud Build
producer network can use to allocate to VMs maintaining a connection
with private repositories.
To use the VPC network with Cloud Build, your
prefix length must be /23 or lower, such as /22 or /21 . This is to
accommodate, at a minimum, both your triggers and your worker pools,
because each service connection tries to claim an IP range with a prefix
length of /24 .
You can specify the range using the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
routing notation in the format STARTING_IP/SUBNET_PREFIX_SIZE . For example,
192.0.2.0/24 has a prefix length of 24. The first 24 bits of the IP range
are used as the subnet mask ( 192.0.2.0 ) while the possible hosts addresses
range from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 .
Note: The value of your prefix length must not exceed /29 . If no
value is specified for the range, a default value of /24 is automatically
assigned. If no value is specified for the prefix length, IP addresses
are automatically assigned within the peered VPC network.
Establish a VPC network private connection between your VPC network and Google Cloud. To learn more, see Creating a private connection .
If you have DNS configured for your Bitbucket Server instance, you need to manually peer your DNS zone to our service provider. To learn
more, see the Sharing private DNS zones with service producers .
[OPTIONAL] If you do not want to create a private connection from your Cloud project,
you can set up a Shared VPC and have your Cloud project use that network instead if your project is part of an organization. You will still need the Shared VPC to be peered to the network.
Use private pools
to run your builds. If you have not created a private pool,
see create a new private pool .
Connect a Bitbucket Server host .
Connect a Bitbucket Server repository .
Create a Bitbucket Server trigger
to build repositories hosted on a Bitbucket Server instance.
Your Bitbucket Server trigger will now automatically invoke builds on
your Bitbucket Server instance based on your configuration. To learn how to run builds using a private pool, see Running builds in a private pool .
