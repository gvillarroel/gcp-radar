Speed up builds with cache images
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can take advantage of buildpacks
cache images
to reuse results from a previous build. This reduces the overall duration of time
when you build images with Google Cloud's buildpacks, including when you
build images in ephemeral environments such as Cloud Build.
The following steps in this guide focus on remote builds with Cloud Build.
For local builds, refer to both the
cache image
instructions and
pack command reference
page.
Using cache images with Cloud Build
You must create a
build configuration file ,
for example cloudbuild.yaml , to enable buildpacks cache images in
Cloud Build. Your build configuration file instructs the pack CLI to
publish a build image to a specified remote repository. This build image then
gets used as your "cache image" for subsequent builds.
Note that the first build that you run with your new build configuration file
uses the pack command to create and then push the initial build image cache
to your repository. Your build performance improvements are seen only after the
initial cache image is available to your builds.
Creating a build configuration file
To define a Cloud Build configuration file you must write a YAML
file with a build step that uses the pack CLI create your image.
In the following example cloudbuild.yaml , the build creates an image for your
application or function using buildpacks, creates the initial build
cache image, and pushes it to a repository:
options :
logging : CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
pool : {}
projectId : PROJECT_ID
steps :
- name : gcr.io/k8s-skaffold/pack
entrypoint : pack
args :
- build
- LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPO_NAME / IMAGE_NAME
- --builder
- gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:latest
- --cache-image
- LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPO_NAME / CACHE_IMAGE_NAME :latest
- --publish
Replace:
LOCATION with the region name of your container repository. Example:
us-west2
PROJECT_ID with the ID of your Google Cloud project.
REPO_NAME with the name of your Docker repository.
IMAGE_NAME with the name of your application or function container image.
CACHE_IMAGE_NAME with the name of your build cache image.
Also see the other supported aurgements that you can define in your build
configuration file in the
pack build command reference .
Building remotely with cache images
To run a build, you include the --config command flag and specify your
configuration file. For example, to use a file named cloudbuild.yaml you
might run:
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml --pack image=example-docker.pkg.dev/my-project-id/repo/example-image
