Create Cloud Tasks queues
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create Cloud Tasks queues. When tasks
are added to a queue, the queue dispatches them and makes sure they are reliably
processed by a service, also known as a worker .
Note the following:
Queue names consist of three parts: a project ID, a location, and a queue ID.
You must have a Google Cloud project
which provides the project ID.
If you are using App Engine target tasks, you must also have an
App Engine application
which is located in a specific region and which is
where your queue and your handlers run. Note the region when you add the app.
Note: Two locations, called europe-west and
us-central in App Engine commands, are called, respectively,
europe-west1 and us-central1 in
Cloud Tasks commands.
Using HTTP Target tasks doesn't require an App Engine app. You select
a Google Cloud location when you create your queue.
Create a queue
You can create a queue in the following ways:
In the Google Cloud console
By using the Google Cloud CLI in either your terminal or Cloud Shell
By sending a direct request to the Cloud Tasks API
Note: If you are configuring routing for an App Engine queue and you don't
explicitly set the target service
that contains the appropriate worker, the
default service
is used. For more information, see
Configure Cloud Tasks queues .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Tasks
> Queues page.
Go to Queues
Click
add_box
Create queue .
Enter a Queue name —for example, my-queue .
In the Region list, select a supported location
where the queue will run—for example, asia-south1 .
If your organization
restricts resource location
and you want to create your queue in either us-central1 or us-central2 ,
the organization policy must allow queue creation in both us-central1
and us-central2 (even if you only need a queue in one of those regions).
Optionally, you can further
configure your queue .
Click Create .
gcloud
Use the gcloud tasks queues create
command to create your queue:
gcloud tasks queues create QUEUE_ID \
--location= LOCATION
Replace the following:
QUEUE_ID : the identifier you assign to your
queue—for example, my-queue .
LOCATION : a supported region
where the queue will run—for example, asia-south1 .
If your organization
restricts resource location
and you want to create your queue in either us-central1 or us-central2 ,
the organization policy must allow queue creation in both us-central1
and us-central2 (even if you only need a queue in one of those regions).
Other flags for the gcloud CLI command let you configure rate
limits, retry options, queue types, and more.
REST API
To create a queue, use the
projects.locations.queues.create
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : a supported
region where the queue will run—for
example, asia-south1 .
If your organization
restricts resource location
and you want to create your queue in either us-central1 or us-central2 ,
the organization policy must allow queue creation in both us-central1 and
us-central2 (even if you only need a queue in one of those regions).
QUEUE_ID : the identifier you assign
to your queue—for example, my-queue .
Other configurable properties for the
Queue
resource include rate limits, retry options, queue types, and more.
Request JSON body:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues/ QUEUE_ID "
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
cat > request.json PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues/ QUEUE_ID "
}
EOF
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://cloudtasks.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
@'
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues/ QUEUE_ID "
}
'@ | Out-File -FilePath request.json -Encoding utf8
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://cloudtasks.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues" | Select-Object -Expand Content
APIs Explorer (browser)
Copy the request body and open the
method reference page .
The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page.
You can interact with this tool to send requests.
Paste the request body in this tool, complete any other required fields, and click Execute .
If successful, the response body contains a newly created instance of
Queue :
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues/ QUEUE_ID ",
"rateLimits": {
"maxDispatchesPerSecond": 500,
"maxBurstSize": 100,
"maxConcurrentDispatches": 1000
},
"retryConfig": {
"maxAttempts": 100,
"minBackoff": "0.100s",
"maxBackoff": "3600s",
"maxDoublings": 16
},
"state": "RUNNING"
}
It can take a few minutes for a newly created queue to be available.
Describe your queue
You can confirm that your queue was created successfully in the following ways:
In the Google Cloud console
By using the gcloud CLI in either your terminal or Cloud Shell
By sending a direct request to the Cloud Tasks API
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Tasks
> Queues page.
Go to Queues
A green checkmark
check_circle
should indicate that your queue is running.
For more details, click the name of the queue, and then click the
Configuration tab.
gcloud
Use the gcloud tasks queues describe
command to verify that your queue was created successfully:
gcloud tasks queues describe QUEUE_ID \
--location= LOCATION
Replace the following:
QUEUE_ID : the queue ID (its short name)
LOCATION : the location of the queue
The output should be similar to the following:
name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues/ QUEUE_ID
rateLimits:
maxBurstSize: 100
maxConcurrentDispatches: 1000
maxDispatchesPerSecond: 500.0
retryConfig:
maxAttempts: 100
maxBackoff: 3600s
maxDoublings: 16
minBackoff: 0.100s
state: RUNNING
REST API
To retrieve a queue, use the
projects.locations.queues.get
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : the
region in which the queue is deployed—for
example, us-central1 .
QUEUE_ID : the
short ID of the queue—for example, my-queue .
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://cloudtasks.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues/ QUEUE_ID "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://cloudtasks.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues/ QUEUE_ID " | Select-Object -Expand Content
APIs Explorer (browser)
Open the
method reference page .
The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page.
You can interact with this tool to send requests.
Complete any required fields and click Execute .
If successful, the response body contains an instance of
Queue :
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues/ QUEUE_ID ",
"rateLimits": {
"maxDispatchesPerSecond": 500,
"maxBurstSize": 100,
"maxConcurrentDispatches": 1000
},
"retryConfig": {
"maxAttempts": 100,
"minBackoff": "0.100s",
"maxBackoff": "3600s",
"maxDoublings": 16
},
"state": "RUNNING"
}
Troubleshoot creating a queue
Note: Logging for your queue is not enabled by default. For information on
enabling logging, see
Use Cloud Logging with queues .
If you don't see the expected output, you can try the following:
Wait at least one minute for the queue to initialize.
Make sure a queue with the same ID does not already exist. You can view the
queues in your project by using the
gcloud tasks queues list command:
gcloud tasks queues list \
--location= LOCATION
To search multiple locations you need to make multiple requests.
Check if you've reached your queue quota :
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API/Service Details
page for the Cloud Tasks API.
Go to API/Service Details
Click the Quotas & System limits tab.
To increase a quota, in the row for the quota, click the ellipsis icon
more_vert >
Edit quota .
For more information, see
Request a quota adjustment .
Re-run the commands to create your queue and ensure that each step is
completed correctly.
