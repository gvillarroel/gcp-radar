Configure Cloud Tasks queues
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can configure your Cloud Tasks queue when you create the queue
or anytime afterwards. The configuration is applied to all tasks in that queue.
Note: The
gcloud tasks queues create
command has a set of optional flags identical to those of the
gcloud tasks queues update
command described in this document.
There are three basic aspects to configuring your queues:
Routing
Rate limits
Retry parameters
Configure queue-level routing
Configuring routing at the queue level overrides routing set at the task level.
This is useful if you want to use Cloud Tasks as a buffer in front
of your target service, or if you need to change the routing for all tasks in a
queue.
Queue-level routing applies to:
Tasks that are in the queue
Tasks that are added to the queue after queue-level routing has been set
Limitations
Queue-level routing is not compatible with Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS)
customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK). If CMEK is enabled, you can't do the
following:
Create tasks on a queue that has queue-level routing
Apply queue-level routing
Configure queue-level routing for HTTP tasks
You can configure a queue to override task-level routing either when creating
the queue or when updating the queue. To configure queue-level routing, set the
queue's
uriOverride
parameter to your preferred route.
If you are applying queue-level routing as an update to an existing queue, pause
the queue before applying the changes and wait one minute after applying the
changes to resume the queue.
Pause the queue
by running the following command:
gcloud tasks queues pause QUEUE_ID
Replace QUEUE_ID with the ID of your queue.
Update or remove queue-level routing.
To update queue-level routing, set the
uriOverride
parameter to your updated route.
To remove queue-level routing using either the REST or RPC API:
REST API: Send a
patch
request for the queue with an empty payload and the updateMask parameter
set to httpTarget .
RPC API: Send an
updateQueueRequest
for the queue with an empty payload and the update_mask parameter set to
http_target .
The following example uses the REST API to update the host that tasks are
routed to:
curl -X PATCH -d @- -i \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://cloudtasks.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /queues/ QUEUE_ID ?updateMask=httpTarget.uriOverride" << EOF
{
"httpTarget" : { "uriOverride" : { "host" : " NEW_HOST " }}
}
EOF
Replace the following:
ACCESS_TOKEN : your access token. You can get this by
running the following in your terminal:
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project.
You can get this by running the following in your terminal:
gcloud config get-value project
LOCATION : the location of your queue.
NEW_HOST : the new host you want your queue to route
to.
Wait one minute.
It can take up to one minute for the new configuration to take effect. Waiting
to resume the queue helps to prevent tasks from dispatching with the old
configuration.
Resume the queue by running the following command:
gcloud tasks queues resume QUEUE_ID
Configure queue-level routing for App Engine tasks
To configure queue-level routing for App Engine tasks, set the queue's
appEngineRoutingOverride
parameter to your preferred App Engine service and version.
Set up queue-level routing and override any task-level routing:
gcloud tasks queues update QUEUE_ID \
--routing-override = service: SERVICE ,version: VERSION
Replace the following:
QUEUE_ID : the queue ID (its short name).
SERVICE : the App Engine worker service
responsible for task handling.
VERSION : the app version.
For example, if you set up a worker service to handle all tasks in a queue,
you can route to that service and the default version:
gcloud tasks queues update QUEUE_ID \
--routing-override = service: SERVICE
Verify your queue was configured successfully by running the following
command:
gcloud tasks queues describe QUEUE_ID --location = LOCATION
Replace LOCATION with the location of the queue.
The output should be similar to the following:
appEngineRoutingOverride :
host : SERVICE . PROJECT_ID .appspot.com
service : SERVICE
name : projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /queues/ QUEUE_ID
rateLimits :
maxBurstSize : 100
maxConcurrentDispatches : 1000
maxDispatchesPerSecond : 500.0
retryConfig :
maxAttempts : 100
maxBackoff : 3600s
maxDoublings : 16
minBackoff : 0.100s
state : RUNNING
To remove queue-level routing, run the following command:
gcloud tasks queues update QUEUE_ID \
--clear-routing-override
When queue-level routing is removed, task-level routing is applied to tasks
in the queue and tasks added to the queue in the future.
Define rate limits
The rate limit determines the maximum rate at which tasks can be dispatched by a
queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry.
Set the maximum rate and number of concurrent tasks that can be dispatched by
a queue by running the following command:
gcloud tasks queues update QUEUE_ID \
--max-dispatches-per-second = DISPATCH_RATE \
--max-concurrent-dispatches = MAX_CONCURRENT_DISPATCHES
Replace the following:
QUEUE_ID : the queue ID (its short name).
DISPATCH_RATE : the dispatch rate. This is
the rate at which tokens in the bucket are refreshed. In
conditions where there is a relatively steady flow of tasks, this is the
equivalent of the rate at which tasks are dispatched.
MAX_CONCURRENT_DISPATCHES : the maximum number of
tasks in the queue that can run at once.
For example, if you created a queue without setting any parameters, you can
update the maximum number of concurrent tasks by running the following command:
gcloud tasks queues update QUEUE_ID \
--max-concurrent-dispatches = MAX_CONCURRENT_DISPATCHES
Verify your queue was configured successfully by running the following
command:
gcloud tasks queues describe QUEUE_ID --location = LOCATION
Replace LOCATION with the location of the queue.
The output should be similar to the following:
name : projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /queues/ QUEUE_ID
rateLimits :
maxBurstSize : 100
maxConcurrentDispatches : MAX_CONCURRENT_DISPATCHES
maxDispatchesPerSecond : 500.0
retryConfig :
maxAttempts : 100
maxBackoff : 3600s
maxDoublings : 16
minBackoff : 0.100s
state : RUNNING
Methods to define queue processing rates
You can define queue processing rates using either the Cloud Tasks API or by
uploading a queue.yaml file. Both methods result in queues that use the same
underlying mechanism.
Caution: While either method can be used to create queues, it is strongly
recommended that you use either a queue.yaml file or the Cloud Tasks API
to configure your queues, but not both. For more information, see
Use Queue Management or queue.yaml .
In both cases, the queue uses the token bucket
algorithm to control the rate of task execution. Each named queue has a bucket
that holds its tokens.
Each time your application executes a task, a token is removed from the bucket.
The queue continues processing tasks until its bucket runs out of tokens. The
system refills the bucket with new tokens continuously based on the
max_dispatches_per_second rate that you specify for the queue. If your queue
contains tasks to process, and the queue's bucket contains tokens, the system
simultaneously processes as many tasks as there are tokens, up to the
max_concurrent_dispatches value you have set.
An uneven load can allow the number of tokens in the bucket to grow
significantly, which can lead to bursts of processing when a burst of requests
comes in. In this case, your queue might experience an actual dispatch rate that
exceeds your max_dispatches_per_second rate, consuming system resources and
competing with user-serving requests. In cases where you are using queues to
manage dispatch rates based on relatively slow SLAs for downstream services,
this can lead to errors like HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) or HTTP 503
(Service Unavailable).
When you use any Cloud Tasks API method, you have two fields to define the
queue dispatch rate:
max_dispatches_per_second
max_concurrent_dispatches
A third field, max_burst_size , is calculated by the system based on the value
you set for max_dispatches_per_second . For more information, see
RateLimits messages .
When you use the
queue.yaml method ,
you can set all three elements:
max_concurrent_requests , which is equivalent to max_concurrent_dispatches
rate , which is equivalent to max_dispatches_per_second
bucket_size , which is equivalent to max_burst_size
In most cases, using the Cloud Tasks API method and letting the system set
max_burst_size produce a very efficient rate for managing request bursts. In
some cases, however, particularly when the rate needed is relatively slow,
either using the queue.yaml method to manually set bucket_size to a small
value, or setting your max_concurrent_dispatches to a small value using
the Cloud Tasks API, can give you more control.
Set retry parameters
If a task doesn't complete successfully, Cloud Tasks will retry the
task with an exponential backoff according to the parameters you have set.
Tip: To debug your retry parameters, you can log the status code for each
invocation of a task by
using Cloud Logging with your queues
and by setting a log sampling ratio to specify what fraction of operations to
write to Cloud Logging.
Specify the maximum number of times to retry failed tasks in the queue,
set a time limit for retry attempts, and control the interval between attempts
by running the following command:
gcloud tasks queues update QUEUE_ID \
--max-attempts = MAX_ATTEMPTS \
--max-retry-duration = MAX_RETRY_DURATION \
--min-backoff = MIN_INTERVAL \
--max-backoff = MAX_INTERVAL \
--max-doublings = MAX_DOUBLINGS
Replace the following:
QUEUE_ID : the queue ID (its short name).
MAX_ATTEMPTS : the maximum number of attempts for a
task, including the first attempt. You can allow unlimited retries by setting
this flag to -1 . Note that if MAX_ATTEMPTS is set to
-1 , MAX_RETRY_DURATION is still applied.
MAX_RETRY_DURATION : the maximum amount of time for
retrying a failed task measured from when the task was first attempted. The
value must be a string that ends in "s," such as 5s . If set to 0 , the task
age is unlimited. Note that if MAX_RETRY_DURATION is
set to 0 , MAX_ATTEMPTS is still applied.
Note: If MAX_ATTEMPTS is set to a value other than -1 and
MAX_RETRY_DURATION is greater than zero, then Cloud Tasks stops
retrying when MAX_ATTEMPTS and MAX_RETRY_DURATION are both satisfied. When
the task has been attempted MAX_ATTEMPTS times and the MAX_RETRY_DURATION
time has passed, no further attempts are made, and the task is deleted. If
MAX_ATTEMPTS is set to -1 and MAX_RETRY_DURATION is set to 0 , then
the task is retried infinitely.
MIN_INTERVAL : the minimum amount of time to wait
between retry attempts. The value must be a string that ends in "s," such as 5s .
MAX_INTERVAL : the maximum amount of time to wait
between retry attempts. The value must be a string that ends in "s," such as 5s .
MAX_DOUBLINGS : the maximum number of times that the
interval between failed task retries will be doubled before the increase becomes
constant. A task's retry interval starts at MIN_INTERVAL ,
then doubles MAX_DOUBLINGS times, then increases
linearly, and finally retries at intervals of MAX_INTERVAL
up to MAX_ATTEMPTS times.
For example, if MIN_INTERVAL is 10s ,
MAX_INTERVAL is 300s , and
MAX_DOUBLINGS is 3 , the retry interval will
double 3 times, increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s, and then retry at
intervals of MAX_INTERVAL until the task has been
attempted MAX_ATTEMPTS times: 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s,
160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, and so forth.
For more parameter details, see the
RetryConfig settings for the Queue resource .
Verify your queue was configured successfully by running the following
command:
gcloud tasks queues describe QUEUE_ID --location = LOCATION
Replace LOCATION with the location of the queue.
The output should contain the retry parameters that you set.
