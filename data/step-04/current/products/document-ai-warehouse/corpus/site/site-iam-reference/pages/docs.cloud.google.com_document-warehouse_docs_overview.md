Document AI Warehouse overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Caution : Document AI Warehouse is deprecated and will no longer be available on Google Cloud
after January 16, 2025. To safeguard your data, migrate any documents currently saved in Document AI Warehouse to an alternative like Cloud Storage.
Verify that your data migration is completed before the discontinuation date to prevent any data loss. See Deprecations for details.
Conceptual Overview
Document AI Warehouse is an integrated, cloud-based platform to store, search,
organize, govern and analyze documents and their structured metadata (called
Properties). Documents include structured (e.g. forms, invoices) and
unstructured (e.g. contracts, research papers) and their Properties (metadata)
includes AI-extracted data from documents and manually or AI-assigned tags (for example,
account number, loan ID, document type).
Key Benefits and Features
Document AI Warehouse offers several advantages over legacy repositories. Following
are some features and benefits:
API-first: single integrated API to manage documents and their
properties (extracted or tagged metadata), that integrates into your
workflows and applications.
Metadata Management : to manage extracted and tagged metadata.
Governance : integrated with IAM and corporate directories
Fine-grained Access Control (permissions) at the document and folder
levels can be assigned to users and groups to view, edit, manage (share,
delete) documents.
Document AI Warehouse is integrated with IAM (Cloud Identity), so that users
and groups can be provisioned into Cloud Identity
Users/groups can also be federated/synced into Cloud Identity from an
enterprise LDAP / identity provider such Azure AD, Active Directory and
Keycloak.
Search : the product supports rich semantic search, including the
following features:
Full-text search
Filtering search results by Properties (date, numeric, enum, text).
Filters can be combined with AND and OR operators
Semantic search - support common synonyms and misspellings, stemmings.
Quotes (" ") may be used in the query to specify exact matching keywords
Custom synonyms - industry-specific or company-specific terms, for
example.
Search within a root-folder hierarchy
Operators for search keywords: "" exact match, | or, + and, -
exclude
Organization : Flexible Folder management
Documents can be cataloged into one or more folders, based on
application (for example, an ID card is placed in a KYC folder, Loan
folder, Bank Account folder), without replicating the document.
These folders have their own Properties and Access Control, independent
from Document properties and access control.
The folders can be nested in one or more hierarchies [for example,
AllLoans->State->Branch->Loans or LoanTypes->Loans].
Users can search for documents within a folder hierarchy e.g. search
within AllLoans->State
UI * - the product includes Web-accessible
UI with the following features:
Doc Explorer: search documents, filter search results, select documents
to bulk-update properties or delete
Doc Viewer: view documents, view/update its properties,assign ACLs, add
to folders
Upload: upload documents and run them through a
DocAI ** extractor (either OCR or a
supported specialized parser such as Invoice DocAI).
Folder Explorer: add documents to one or more folders, explore folder
hierarchy.
Embeddable UI: the Doc Explorer and the Doc Viewer (for PDFs) components
can be integrated in customer's applications
Connectors *** to common on-premise
and cloud repositories: We provide a Cloud Storage to Document AI Warehouse
connector (as a separate template based on
Google Workflows ) that can be
customized/extended to other repositories. We also work with partners to
provide out-of-box connectors to repositories such as Sharepoint, Amazon S3,
IBM FileNet and others, to ingest and index documents.
Migrate vs Federate flexibility : The product supports a flexible
architecture such that your document content can be migrated to
Document AI Warehouse or stay-in-place if there are constraints in migrating
content (we simply index the content and metadata)
Integrated with Document Workflows - this integrates with Google
Workflows and other document processing workflows by supporting:
Properties - that represent the state of a document in a workflow
and APIs that workflows can use to update the state of documents
Doc Explorer interface - to track the progress of documents through
a workflow pipeline, enabling a human to inspect, manage failures and
stalled documents in the workflow pipeline.
Conditional Notifications - where documents meeting a certain
conditions can trigger/notify a workflow via a Pub/Sub topic or
a Web API call: for example, Trigger: OnUpdate; Condition:
(DocType=Invoice and TotalAmount>$1000) -> send Pub/Sub
Notification
Policy Management and Compliance Enforcement : conditional notifications
and scheduled notifications can be used to trigger workflows that enforce
policies (for example, records management, retention and disposition, legal
holds) on specific documents in Document AI Warehouse.
Files supported - Text PDFs, Images (scanned PDFs, TIFF files, JPEG
files), Office (DOCX, PPTX, XLSX) files - run through OCR and indexed.
Note - while the product focus is documents, it is also used to manage
associated images (e.g. in verticals such as Insurance, Engg,
Construction, Research, etc).
Integrated with DocAI : Document AI Warehouse is integrated with Document AI
processors at several levels:
Document AI processing in UI : Document AI Warehouse UI enables
users to upload either scanned PDFs/TIFFs or special document types,
both of which are automatically extracted by Document AI OCR or
specialized processors respectively before the document is indexed into
Document AI Warehouse.
Managing batch Document AI
pipelines *** : Document AI Warehouse
integrates with Workflows to provide templates that process
batch pipelines of documents through Document AI extraction and
classification. This is non-trivial because it entails long-running
(LRO) operations and asynchronous API calls that need to be managed for
failures and retries. The Workflows template orchestrates such
pipelines. Document AI Warehouse UI may be used to search and track the
document flow through such pipelines, visualize the Document AI
output for failures in each step of the pipeline and take action on
stalled/failed documents.
* The UI is in Preview and expected to go GA soon.
** OCR and other document extractors are available in
Document AI products but not included in Document AI Warehouse.
*** These features are not part of
Document AI Warehouse. These features are enabled by external open source components
and scripts that customers can deploy or customize and are not implemented
within Document AI Warehouse.

Terminology
Following are terms used in Document AI Warehouse.
Terms, Concepts
Definition, Examples
Document
A record in Document AI Warehouse that users can search, manage, and enforce access control on. It comprises the raw document and some associated metadata.
[Images stored in Document AI Warehouse are also referred to as "Documents"]
Raw Document [Content]
The raw content file (pdf/image/binary/blob) of the Document.
Schema [Document Type]
Each document is of a certain document type and is specified by a schema. E.g. an Invoice contains the following schema: Supplier Name, Vendor Name, Invoice Amount, etc.
Property [Metadata]
Fields of the Document Schema that may either be extracted from the document or enriched (labeled) by users. Currently Metadata includes the following types: Free Text values, Enum, Numeric, Date, Map (a JSON hierarchy of key-value pairs). We plan to support Boolean, Money, and other types going forward.
Doc extractors (DocAI and others)
Documents may be extracted by an AI pipeline, so that the extractions can be ingested and managed in Document AI Warehouse (as Metadata) along with the Raw Document. The extraction can be done by
Document AI Specialized parsers (for Procurement forms, Lending forms, others)
OCR, AutoML, Forms parser (for images such as TIFF/PNG/etc.)
Other custom models
Text extracting tools for specialized document formats such as PDFs, Office documents and others.
Note that Document AI Warehouse can work with any extraction pipeline that calls Document AI Warehouse APIs to ingest/update documents.
Folders
A folder is a virtual collection of documents (virtual because the same document can be contained in one or more folders). It has a "Document Type/Schema" and contains metadata and Access Control Lists just like documents.
A user needs Edit permission to the Folder and View permission to the Document), in order to add a Document to a Folder
Links
Links are used to add documents to folders or to link related documents together. Links do not have a "Link Type"
Related Documents
Documents can be related by directional links from one document to another.
Link Permissions
A user needs Edit permission to the Link-from object (e.g. Folder) and View permission to the Link-To object (e.g. Document), in order to add a Document to a Folder
Policy
A policy evaluated when a document/folder is created/updated, and is used to validate or update document metadata, ACLs or add/move/remove docs from folders. A policy comprises:
A Trigger, for example, upon DocUpdate/DocCreate
Condition, for example, Invoice.Amount <$1000
Action, for example, Update Doc Metadata, Return Condition Evaluation, Add Doc to Folder, etc.
A policy is typically associated with a Document Type.
It is expressed in a low-code Common Expression Language (JSON format, specified later)
Notification Policy
Is a special type of policy where the Action is publishing a message to a Pub/Sub} Topic when a certain condition is met. Consuming applications / workflows may consume the message to trigger actions on the documents or other parts of a business workflow.
Policy Engine, Policy APIs
Engine: The server that evaluates policies and takes actions
API: Admin API used to create/update/read/delete policies.
Faceted Search
A Facet is a metadata filter used in a search query. For example, search for Bank Statements from "Month = March 2021" and "Branch State = CA" filters the Search results by these 2 facets.
Facet is typically an enumerated field.. We will support Date and Numeric facets in future releases.
Facets for a Document type are specified in the Document Schema by Admins (via Admin API)
Semantic Search
Semantic search supports synonyms or "semantically related" terms in the search query. E.g. "Driver license" returns "driver permit".
Search Histogram
Histogram is a search API feature that returns the distribution (counts) of search results by facet. For example, the Search results for Driver License returns the histogram "CA 500, NV 150, …"
Universal Access vs Doc-level Access Control
Two access modes are supported in Document AI Warehouse for each project
Universal access - any user can access any document in the project. The API is access-controlled to user accounts or service accounts but no document-level permissions
Doc-level ACL - users are granted document-level permissions. Each document has R/U/D permissions assigned to users/groups.
