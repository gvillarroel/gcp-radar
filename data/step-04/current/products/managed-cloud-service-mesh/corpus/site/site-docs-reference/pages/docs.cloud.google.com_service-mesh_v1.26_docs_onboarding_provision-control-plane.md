Provision a managed Cloud Service Mesh control plane on GKE
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
Cloud Service Mesh is a Google-managed service mesh that you simply enable.
Google handles reliability, upgrades, scaling, and security for you.
This page shows you how to use the
fleet API to set up managed
Cloud Service Mesh using Istio APIs.
Prerequisites
As a starting point, this guide assumes that you have:
A Cloud project
A Cloud Billing account
Obtained the required permissions
to provision Cloud Service Mesh
Enabled
Workload Identity
on your clusters and node pools.
Requirements
One or more clusters with a
supported version of GKE ,
in one of the supported regions .
Note that managed Cloud Service Mesh uses GKE release
channels to balance between stability and upgrade speed. New changes to
Cloud Service Mesh in-cluster components (including CNI, MDPC, proxies, and
Istio CRDs) will rollout to clusters that subscribe GKE rapid
channel first. They will then be promoted to GKE regular
channel, and finally the GKE stable channel, once they
demonstrate enough stability.
Best practice is to provision a subset of your fleet clusters in an earlier
GKE release channel to ensure they receive updates to the
Cloud Service Mesh components first.
Managed Cloud Service Mesh doesn't support changing GKE
release channels.
If you do change the GKE release channel,
Cloud Service Mesh won't prevent the operation.
Cloud Service Mesh automatically updates the in-cluster
components (CNI, MDPC, default injected proxy version and Istio CRDs) to
align with the current GKE release channel.
Ensure that your cluster has enough capacity for the required components that
managed Cloud Service Mesh installs in the cluster.
The mdp-controller deployment in kube-system namespace requests cpu:
50m, memory: 128Mi.
The istio-cni-node daemonset in kube-system namespace requests cpu: 100m,
memory: 100Mi on each node.
Ensure that the organizational policy constraints/compute.disableInternetNetworkEndpointGroup is disabled.
If the policy is enabled, ServiceEntry may not work.
Ensure that the client machine that you provision managed Cloud Service Mesh from has
network connectivity to the API server.
Your clusters must be registered to a fleet .
This is included in the instructions if it's not already registered prior to the
provision.
Your project must have the Service Mesh fleet feature enabled. This is
included in the instructions if you haven't enabled it yet.
GKE Autopilot is only supported with GKE version
1.21.3+.
Cloud Service Mesh can use multiple GKE clusters in a
single-project single-network environment or a multi-project single-network
environment.
If you join clusters that are not in the same project, they must be
registered to the same
fleet host project ,
and the clusters must be in a shared VPC
configuration together on the same network.
For a single-project multi-cluster environment, the fleet project can be
the same as the cluster project. For more information about fleets, see
Fleets Overview .
For a multi-project environment, we recommend that you host the fleet in a
separate project from the cluster projects. If your organizational
policies and existing configuration allow it, we recommend that you use
the shared VPC project as the fleet host project. For more information,
see
Setting up clusters with Shared VPC .
Roles required to install Cloud Service Mesh
The following table describes the roles that are required to install managed
Cloud Service Mesh.
Role name
Role ID
Grant location
Description

(Note 2)
Roles required to run Cloud Service Mesh
The following table describes the roles that are required by the service account
to run managed Cloud Service Mesh. If your network or cluster projects differ
from the fleet host project, you need to give the service account in the fleet
project access to these roles in the other projects.
Role name
Role ID
Grant location
Description
Anthos Service Mesh Service Agent
roles/anthosservicemesh.serviceAgent
Fleet project
Mesh Managed Control Plane Service Agent (legacy)
roles/meshcontrolplane.serviceAgent
Fleet project
This is a legacy role that was part of older installations of
Cloud Service Mesh. If your installation has this service role,
you can leave it as is. New installations don't need this role.
Limitations
Caution: Note the following fleet-specific limitations:
- All clusters in a particular Cloud Service Mesh must be registered to the
same fleet. The clusters cannot be registered to different fleets.
- All clusters in a project that includes a Cloud Service Mesh cluster must
be registered to the same fleet.
We recommend that you review the list of
Cloud Service Mesh supported features and limitations .
In particular, note the following:
Workload pods running with hostNetwork: true
are not supported.
The IstioOperator API isn't supported since its main purpose is to control
in-cluster components.
Note: You can still enable optional features without using the IstioOperator API,
see Enabling optional features on managed Cloud Service Mesh .
You can also use the migration tool included with asmcli to automatically
convert other IstioOperator optional features to be compatible with
managed control plane. For more information, see
Migrate from IstioOperator .
Using Certificate Authority Service (CA Service) requires configuring Cloud Service Mesh per cluster ,
and is not supported when using the fleet-default configuration
in GKE Enterprise.
For GKE Autopilot clusters, cross-project setup is only
supported with GKE 1.23 or later.
For GKE Autopilot clusters, in order to adapt to the
GKE Autopilot resource limit ,
the default proxy resource requests and limits are set to 500m CPU and 512 Mb
memory. You can override the default values using
custom injection .
For GKE Autopilot clusters, there may be warnings for
Cloud Service Mesh components "DaemonSet has no nodes selected" until the
clusters' NodePool scales.
During the provisioning process for a managed control plane, Istio CRDs are
provisioned in the specified cluster. If there are existing Istio CRDs in the
cluster, they will be overwritten.
Istio CNI
and Traffic Director are not compatible with GKE Sandbox. Therefore,
managed Cloud Service Mesh with the TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR implementation does
not support clusters with GKE Sandbox enabled.

networkservices.googleapis.com , and/or
networksecurity.googleapis.com causes managed
Cloud Service Mesh control plane to stop working. If the fleet does not
use managed Cloud Service Mesh on any cluster, then these APIs can be
disabled.
Configure managed Cloud Service Mesh
The steps required to provision managed Cloud Service Mesh using the fleet API depend
on whether you prefer to enable by
default for new fleet clusters or
enable it per cluster .
Configure for your fleet
You must have
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Enterprise edition enabled to
enable managed Cloud Service Mesh as a default configuration for your fleet.
This means that every new GKE on Google Cloud cluster
registered during cluster creation
will have managed Cloud Service Mesh enabled on the cluster. You can find out
more about fleet default configuration in Manage fleet-level
features .
Enabling managed Cloud Service Mesh as a default configuration for your fleet and registering
clusters to the fleet during cluster creation only supports
Mesh CA . If you want to use
Certificate Authority Service, we recommend that you enable it per cluster .
To enable fleet-level defaults for managed Cloud Service Mesh, complete the
following steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Feature Manager page.
Go to Feature Manager
In the Service Mesh pane, click Configure .
Review the settings that are inherited by all new clusters that you
create in the Google Cloud console and register to the fleet.
Note: These settings are GKE settings that are prerequisites
for using Cloud Service Mesh.
To apply these settings, click Configure .
In the confirmation dialog, click Confirm .
Optional: Sync existing clusters to the default settings:
In the Clusters in the fleet list, select the clusters that you want
to sync. You can only select clusters that have Cloud Service Mesh installed.
Click Sync to fleet settings and click Confirm in the
confirmation dialog that appears. This operation can take a few minutes
to complete.
gcloud
To configure fleet-level defaults using the Google Cloud CLI, you must
establish the following settings:
Fleet-level settings
Create a mesh.yaml file that only contains the single line
management: automatic :
echo "management: automatic" > mesh.yaml
Enable Cloud Service Mesh for your fleet:
gcloud container fleet mesh enable --project FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
--fleet-default-member-config mesh.yaml
If you see the following error, then you need to
enable GKE Enterprise .
ERROR: (gcloud.container.fleet.mesh.enable) FAILED_PRECONDITION: The
[anthos.googleapis.com] service is required for this operation and is not
enabled for the project [PROJECT_NUMBER]. Please use the Google Developers
Console to enable it.: failed precondition
Network-level settings
If your network's project differs from your fleet host project (for example
you are using a shared VPC ), you must allow
Cloud Service Mesh service accounts in the fleet project to access the
network project. You only need to do this once for the network project.
Grant service accounts in the fleet project permission to access the
network project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding " NETWORK_PROJECT_ID " \
--member "serviceAccount:service- FLEET_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-servicemesh.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role roles/anthosservicemesh.serviceAgent
Cluster-level settings
When you're ready to create clusters to use with Cloud Service Mesh, create and
register them in a single step with Google Cloud CLI to use the default
configuration. For example:
gcloud container clusters create-auto CLUSTER_NAME \
--fleet-project FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
--location = LOCATION
You can get the project number for your fleet project by running the
following command:
gcloud projects list --filter = " FLEET_PROJECT_ID " --format = "value(PROJECT_ID)"
The --location flag is the compute zone or region (such as
us-central1-a or us-central1 ) for the cluster.
If your cluster's project differs from your fleet host project, you must
allow Cloud Service Mesh service accounts in the fleet project to access the
cluster project, and enable required APIs on the cluster project. You only
need to do this once for each cluster project.
Grant service accounts in the fleet project permission to access the
cluster project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding " CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID " \
--member "serviceAccount:service- FLEET_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-servicemesh.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role roles/anthosservicemesh.serviceAgent
Enable the Mesh API on the cluster's project:
gcloud services enable mesh.googleapis.com \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID
Replace CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID with the unique identifier of
your cluster project. If you created your cluster in the same project
as your fleet, then the CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID is the same as
the FLEET_PROJECT_ID .
Proceed to
Verify the control plane has been provisioned .
Configure per cluster
Use the following steps to configure managed Cloud Service Mesh for each
cluster in your mesh individually.
Enable the Cloud Service Mesh fleet feature
Enable the mesh feature on the fleet project. Note that if you plan to
register multiple clusters, enabling the Cloud Service Mesh fleet feature
happens at the fleet-level so you only have to run this command once.
gcloud container fleet mesh enable --project FLEET_PROJECT_ID
Register clusters to a fleet
Register a GKE cluster
using fleet workload identity. The --location flag is the compute zone or
region (such as us-central1-a or us-central1 ) for the cluster.
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location CLUSTER_LOCATION \
--fleet-project FLEET_PROJECT_ID
Verify your cluster is registered:
gcloud container fleet memberships list --project FLEET_PROJECT_ID
Example output:
NAME EXTERNAL_ID LOCATION
cluster-1 1d8e255d-2b55-4df9-8793-0435461a2cbc us-central1
Make note of the MEMBERSHIP_NAME , as you will need it when you
enable automatic management .
If your cluster's network's project differs from your fleet host project
(for example you are using a shared VPC ), you must allow
Cloud Service Mesh service accounts in the fleet project to access the
network project. You only need to do this once for the network project.
Grant service accounts in the fleet project permission to access the
network project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding " NETWORK_PROJECT_ID " \
--member "serviceAccount:service- FLEET_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-servicemesh.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role roles/anthosservicemesh.serviceAgent
If your cluster's project differs from your fleet host project, you must allow
Cloud Service Mesh service accounts in the fleet project to access the cluster
project, and enable required APIs on the cluster project.
You only need to do this once for each cluster project. If you previously
configured managed Cloud Service Mesh for this combination of cluster and
fleet projects, then these changes have already been applied and you don't
have to run the following commands.
Grant service accounts in the fleet project permission to access the cluster
project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding " CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID " \
--member "serviceAccount:service- FLEET_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-servicemesh.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role roles/anthosservicemesh.serviceAgent
Enable the Mesh API on the cluster's project:
gcloud services enable mesh.googleapis.com \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID
Configure Certificate Authority Service (Optional)
If your service mesh deployment requires Certificate Authority Service (CA Service),
then follow Configure Certificate Authority Service for managed Cloud Service Mesh
to enable it for your fleet. Make sure to complete all steps before proceeding
to the next section.
Enable automatic management
Run the following command to enable automatic management:
Note: You can apply this change to multiple clusters at a time by passing a
comma-separated list of membership names as the --memberships parameter.
gcloud container fleet mesh update \
--management automatic \
--memberships MEMBERSHIP_NAME \
--project FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
--location MEMBERSHIP_LOCATION
where:
MEMBERSHIP_NAME is the membership name listed when you verified
that your cluster was registered to the fleet.
MEMBERSHIP_LOCATION is the location of your membership (either a
region, or global ).
If you recently created the membership using the command in this guide, this
should be the region of your cluster. If you have a zonal cluster, use the
region corresponding to the cluster's zone. For example, if you have a zonal
cluster in us-central1-c , then use the value us-central1 .
This value may be global if you registered prior to May 2023, or if you
specified the global location when registering the membership. You can
check your membership's location with
gcloud container fleet memberships list --project FLEET_PROJECT_ID .
Terraform support
Cloud Service Mesh supports provisioning via Terraform through
the GKEHub feature membership module .
Please see the
Provision managed service mesh tutorial
for detailed instructions.
Verify the control plane has been provisioned
After a few minutes, verify that the control plane status is ACTIVE :
gcloud container fleet mesh describe --project FLEET_PROJECT_ID
The output is similar to:
...

Take note of the control plane displayed in the implementation field, either
ISTIOD or TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR . See
Cloud Service Mesh supported features
for control plane differences and supported configurations, and for how the
control plane implementation is selected.
Configure kubectl to point to the cluster
The following sections involve running kubectl commands against each one of
your clusters. Before proceeding through the following sections, run the
following command for each of your clusters to configure kubectl to point to
the cluster.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--location CLUSTER_LOCATION \
--project CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID
Note that an ingress gateway isn't automatically deployed with the control
plane. Decoupling the deployment of the ingress gateway and control plane
lets you manage your gateways in a production environment.
If you want to use an Istio ingress gateway or an egress gateway, see
Deploy gateways . If you want to use
the Kubernetes Gateway API, see
Prepare Gateway for Mesh . To enable
other optional features, see
Enabling optional features on Cloud Service Mesh .
Managed data plane
If you use managed Cloud Service Mesh, Google fully manages upgrades of
your proxies.
With the managed data plane feature enabled, the sidecar proxies and injected
gateways are actively and automatically updated in conjunction with the managed
control plane by restarting workloads to re-inject new versions of the proxy.
This starts after the control plane has been upgraded and normally completes
within 2 weeks after starting.
Note that the managed data plane relies on the GKE release
channel. If you change the GKE release channel while the managed
data plane is enabled, managed Cloud Service Mesh will update the proxies of
all existing workloads like an managed data plane rollout.
If disabled , proxy management is
done passively - driven by the natural lifecycle of the pods in the cluster and
must be manually triggered by the user to control the update rate.
The managed data plane upgrades proxies by evicting pods that are running
earlier versions of the proxy. The evictions are done gradually, honoring the
pod disruption budget and controlling the rate of change.
Note: If the cluster has a
GKE maintenance window
defined, pod evictions will commence at the start of the next available
maintenance window and continue without pause until all managed pods have been
updated (usually 12 hours). Maintenance window is not observed for CVE related
rollouts.

1 Cloud Service Mesh active updates automatically replace Pods
in Workloads, except for StatefulSets , Jobs , DaemonSets , and manually injected
Pods . Cloud Service Mesh active updates honor Pod disruption budgets.
Low-priority active updates coincide with GKE maintenance
windows.
High-priority active updates can happen as soon as Cloud Service Mesh
makes them available to your cluster, without respect to GKE
maintenance windows. High-priority active updates usually have at least
one associated CVE.
Enable the managed data plane if you don't want to manage the lifecycle of the
Cloud Service Mesh data plane yourself, and your Workloads can tolerate Pods
being replaced at any time.
Disable the managed data plane if you'd like full control over the time of all
Cloud Service Mesh data plane updates.
Limitations
The managed data plane doesn't manage the following:
Uninjected pods
Manually injected pods
Jobs
StatefulSets
DaemonSets
Disable the managed data plane (optional)
If you are provisioning managed Cloud Service Mesh on a new cluster, then you can
disable the managed data plane completely, or for individual namespaces or pods.
The managed data plane will continue to be disabled for existing clusters where
it was disabled by default or manually.
To disable the managed data plane at the cluster level and revert back to
managing the sidecar proxies yourself, change the annotation:
kubectl annotate --overwrite controlplanerevision -n istio-system \
mesh.cloud.google.com/proxy='{"managed":"false"}'
To disable the managed data plane for a namespace:
kubectl annotate --overwrite namespace NAMESPACE \
mesh.cloud.google.com/proxy='{"managed":"false"}'
To disable the managed data plane for a pod:
kubectl annotate --overwrite pod POD_NAME \
mesh.cloud.google.com/proxy='{"managed":"false"}'
Enable maintenance windows for the managed data plane
If you have a GKE maintenance window configured, active
upgrades will commence at the start of the next available maintenance window and
continue without pause until all managed pods have been updated (usually 12
hours). The maintenance window is not observed for CVE related rollouts.
Cloud Service Mesh uses the
GKE maintenance window
to align with GKE.
Enable maintenance notifications for the managed data plane
You can request to be notified about upcoming managed data plane maintenance up
to a week before maintenance is scheduled. Maintenance notifications are not
sent by default. You must also
Configure a GKE maintenance window
before you can receive notifications. When enabled, notifications are sent at
least two days before the upgrade operation.
Note: If an upgrade occurs outside of a maintenance window (for example, for a
CVE rollout), a notification won't be sent. In those cases, you should rely on
updates published in the release notes.
To opt in to managed data plane maintenance notifications:
Go to the Communication page.
Go to the Communication page
In the Cloud Service Mesh Upgrade row, under the Email column, select the
radio button to turn maintenance notifications ON .
Each user who wants to receive notifications must opt in separately. If you want
to set an email filter for these notifications, the subject line is:
Upcoming upgrade for your Cloud Service Mesh cluster " CLUSTER_LOCATION / CLUSTER_NAME " .
The following example shows a typical managed data plane maintenance
notification:
Subject Line: Upcoming upgrade for your Cloud Service Mesh cluster " <location/cluster-name> "
Dear Cloud Service Mesh user,
The Cloud Service Mesh components in your cluster ${instance_id} (https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/clusters/details/${instance_id}/details?project=${project_id}) are scheduled to upgrade on ${scheduled_date_human_readable} at ${scheduled_time_human_readable}.
You can check the release notes (https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/v1.26/docs/release-notes) to learn about the new update.
In the event that this maintenance gets canceled, you'll receive another email.
Sincerely,
The Cloud Service Mesh Team
(c) 2023 Google LLC 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043
You have received this announcement to update you about important changes to Google Cloud Platform or your account.
You can opt out of maintenance window notifications by editing your user preferences: https://console.cloud.google.com/user-preferences/communication?project=${project_id}
Configure endpoint discovery (only for multi-cluster installations)
If your mesh has only one cluster, skip these multi-cluster steps and proceed to
Deploy applications or
Migrate applications .
Before you continue, ensure that Cloud Service Mesh is configured on each
cluster.
Note: For more information on endpoint discovery, refer to
Endpoint discovery with multiple control planes .
Enabling Cloud Service Mesh with the fleet API will enable endpoint discovery for
this cluster. However, you must
open firewall ports .
To disable endpoint discovery for one or more clusters, see the instructions
to disable it in
Endpoint discovery between clusters with declarative API .
For an example application with two clusters, see
HelloWorld service example .
Note: The HelloWorld service example uses Docker Hub . In a private
cluster, the container runtime can pull container images from Artifact Registry
by default. The container runtime cannot pull images from any other container
image registry on the internet. You can download the image and push to Artifact Registry or use Cloud NAT to provide outbound internet access for certain private nodes. For
more information, see Migrate external containers
and Creating a private cluster .
Deploy applications
If you have more than one cluster in the fleet using managed Cloud Service Mesh, then
ensure endpoint discovery or firewall ports are configured as intended before
proceeding and deploying applications.
Enable the namespace for injection. The steps depend on your control plane implementation .
Managed (TD)
Apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
Managed (Istiod)
Recommended: Run the following command to apply the default injection
label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
If you are an existing user with the Managed Istiod control plane:
We recommend that you use default injection, but revision-based injection is
supported. Use the following instructions:
Run the following command to locate the available release channels:
kubectl -n istio-system get controlplanerevision
The output is similar to the following:
NAME AGE
asm-managed-rapid 6d7h
NOTE: If two control plane revisions appear in the list above, remove one. Having multiple control plane channels in the cluster is not supported.
In the output, the value under the NAME column is the revision label that corresponds to the available release channel for the Cloud Service Mesh version.
Apply the revision label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev = REVISION_LABEL --overwrite
Validate that the namespace label is applied correctly using the following command.
kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection
Example output:
NAME STATUS AGE ISTIO-INJECTION
default Active 5m9s enabled
At this point, you have successfully configured managed Cloud Service Mesh. If you
have any existing workloads in labeled namespaces, then restart them so they get
proxies injected.
If you deploy an application in a multi-cluster setup, replicate the
Kubernetes and control plane configuration in all clusters, unless
you plan to limit that particular config to a subset of clusters. The
configuration applied to a particular cluster is the source of truth for that
cluster.
Customize injection (optional)
You can override default values and customize injection settings but this can
lead to unforeseen configuration errors and resulting issues with sidecar
containers. Before you customize injection, read the information after the
sample for notes on particular settings and recommendations.
Per-pod configuration is available to override these options on individual pods.
This is done by adding an istio-proxy container to your pod. The sidecar
injection will treat any configuration defined here as an override to the
default injection template.
For example, the following configuration customizes a variety of settings,
including lowering the CPU requests, adding a volume mount, and adding a
preStop hook:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
metadata :
name : example
spec :
containers :
- name : hello
image : alpine
- name : istio-proxy
image : auto
resources :
requests :
cpu : "200m"
memory : "256Mi"
limits :
cpu : "200m"
memory : "256Mi"
volumeMounts :
- mountPath : /etc/certs
name : certs
lifecycle :
preStop :
exec :
command : [ "sleep" , "10" ]
volumes :
- name : certs
secret :
secretName : istio-certs
In general, any field in a pod can be set. However, care must be taken for
certain fields:
Kubernetes requires the image field to be set before the injection has run.
While you can set a specific image to override the default one, we recommend
that you set the image to auto , which will cause the sidecar injector
to automatically select the image to use.
Some fields in containers are dependent on related settings. For example,
must be less than or equal to the CPU limit. If both fields are not properly
configured, the pod may fail to start.
Kubernetes lets you set both requests and limits for resources in your
Pod spec . GKE Autopilot only considers requests . For more
information, see Setting resource limits in Autopilot .
Additionally, certain fields are configurable by annotations on the Pod,
although it is recommended to use the above approach to customizing settings.
Take additional care for the following annotations:
For GKE Standard, if sidecar.istio.io/proxyCPU is set, make
sure to explicitly set sidecar.istio.io/proxyCPULimit . Otherwise the sidecar's
CPU limit will be set as unlimited.
For GKE Standard, if sidecar.istio.io/proxyMemory is set,
make sure to explicitly set sidecar.istio.io/proxyMemoryLimit . Otherwise the
sidecar's memory limit will be set as unlimited.
For GKE Autopilot, configuring resource requests and limits
using annotations might overprovision resources. Use the image template approach
to avoid. See Resource modification examples in Autopilot .
For example, see the below resources annotation:
spec :
template :
metadata :
annotations :
sidecar.istio.io/proxyCPU : "200m"
sidecar.istio.io/proxyCPULimit : "200m"
sidecar.istio.io/proxyMemory : "256Mi"
sidecar.istio.io/proxyMemoryLimit : "256Mi"
Migrate applications to managed Cloud Service Mesh
Warning: During the migration process, Istio CRDs are installed in the specified
cluster. If there are existing Istio CRDs in the cluster, they will be
overwritten.
To migrate applications from in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh to managed Cloud Service Mesh,
perform the following steps:
Note: Ensure you have provisioned managed Cloud Service Mesh by following all of the
preceding sections of this guide.
Replace the current namespace label. The steps depend on your control plane implementation .
Managed (TD)
Apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
Managed (Istiod)
Recommended: Run the following command to apply the default injection
label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
If you are an existing user with the Managed Istiod control plane:
We recommend that you use default injection, but revision-based injection is
supported. Use the following instructions:
Run the following command to locate the available release channels:
kubectl -n istio-system get controlplanerevision
The output is similar to the following:
NAME AGE
asm-managed-rapid 6d7h
NOTE: If two control plane revisions appear in the list above, remove one. Having multiple control plane channels in the cluster is not supported.
In the output, the value under the NAME column is the revision label that corresponds to the available release channel for the Cloud Service Mesh version.
Apply the revision label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev = REVISION_LABEL --overwrite
Perform a rolling upgrade of deployments in the namespace:
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
Test your application to verify that the workloads function correctly.
If you have workloads in other namespaces, repeat the previous steps for
each namespace.
If you deployed the application in a multi-cluster setup, replicate the
Kubernetes and Istio configuration in all clusters, unless there is a
desire to limit that configuration to a subset of clusters only. The
configuration applied to a particular cluster is the source of truth for
that cluster.
If you are satisfied that your application works as expected, you can remove the
in-cluster istiod after you switch all namespaces to the managed control
plane, or keep them as a backup - istiod will automatically scale down to use
fewer resources. To remove, skip to
Delete old control plane .
If you encounter problems, you can identify and resolve them by using
the information in
Resolving managed control plane issues
and if necessary, roll back to the previous version.
Delete old control plane
After you install and confirm that all namespaces use the Google-managed control
plane, you can delete the old control plane.
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
If you used istioctl kube-inject instead of automatic injection, or if
you installed additional gateways, check the metrics for the control plane,
and verify that the number of connected endpoints is zero.
Roll back
Perform the following steps if you need to roll back to the previous control
plane version:
Update workloads to be injected with the previous version of the
control plane. In the following command, the revision value asm-191-1 is
used only as an example. Replace the example value with the
revision label of your previous control plane.
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio-injection- istio.io/rev=asm-191-1 --overwrite
Restart the Pods to trigger re-injection so the proxies have the
previous version:
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
The managed control plane will automatically scale to zero and not use any
resource when not in use. The mutating webhooks and provisioning will remain
and do not affect cluster behavior.
The gateway is now set to the asm-managed revision. To roll back, re-run
the Cloud Service Mesh install command, which will re-deploy gateway pointing back
to your in-cluster control plane:
kubectl -n istio-system rollout undo deploy istio-ingressgateway
Expect this output on success:
deployment.apps/istio-ingressgateway rolled back
Uninstall Cloud Service Mesh
Managed control plane auto-scales to zero when no namespaces are using it. For
detailed steps, see Uninstall Cloud Service Mesh .
