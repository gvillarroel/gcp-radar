Plan an installation
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
This page provides information to help you plan a new installation
of in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh for Kubernetes workloads off Google Cloud.
Note: If you need to install Cloud Service Mesh from a private or custom container
registry, see
Install Cloud Service Mesh from a custom container registry .
Customize the control plane
The features that Cloud Service Mesh supports differ between platforms. We recommend
that you review the Supported features to
learn which features are supported on your platform. Some features are enabled
by default, and others you can optionally enable by creating an IstioOperator
overlay file. When you run asmcli install , you can customize the control plane
by specifying the --custom_overlay
option with the overlay file. As a best practice, we recommend that you save
the overlay files in your version control system.
The
asmcli directory
in GitHub contains many overlay files. These files contain common customizations
to the default configuration. You can use these files as they are, or you can
make additional changes to them as needed. Some of the files are required to
enable optional Cloud Service Mesh features .
The anthos-service-mesh package is downloaded when you run asmcli to
validate your project and cluster .
When you install Cloud Service Mesh using asmcli install , you
can specify one or more overlay files with the --option or --custom_overlay .
If you don't need to make any changes to the files in the anthos-service-mesh
repository, you can use --option , and the script fetches the file from GitHub
for you. Otherwise, you can make changes to the overlay file, and then use the
--custom_overlay option to pass it to the asmcli .
Choose a Certificate Authority
Depending on your use case and platform, you can choose one of the following as
the certificate authority (CA) for issuing
mutual TLS (mTLS)
certificates:
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority
Certificate Authority Service
Istio CA
This section provides high-level information about each of these CA options and
their use cases.
Mesh CA
Unless you require a custom CA, we recommend that you use
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority for the following reasons:
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority is a highly reliable and scalable service that is
optimized for dynamically scaled workloads.
With Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, Google manages the security and availability
of the CA backend.
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority lets you rely on a single root of trust across
clusters.
Certificates from Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority include the following data about
your application's services:
The Google Cloud project ID
The GKE namespace
The GKE service account name
Important: The certificates issued by Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority should only be used to enable
secure service-to-service communication within your service mesh, and not be
used for any other purpose. These certificates are sent whenever services
attempt to communicate with each other using mutual TLS. Make sure that you
don't inadvertently expose confidential information by using these certificates
when communicating outside your service mesh.
CA Service
Platform note: CA Service is only supported on the
following platforms: GKE clusters on Google Cloud,
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware, and Distributed Cloud. If you run
asmcli install and specify --ca gcp_cas on other
platforms, the installation appears successful, but your workloads will fail
to start.
In addition to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority ,
you can configure Cloud Service Mesh to use
Certificate Authority Service . This
guide provides you an opportunity to integrate with CA Service,
which is recommended for the following use cases:
If you need different certificate authorities to sign workload certificates
on different clusters.
If you need to back your signing keys in a Cloud HSM .
If you are in a highly regulated industry and are subject to compliance.
If you want to chain up your Cloud Service Mesh CA to a custom enterprise root
certificate to sign workload certificates.
The cost of Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority is included in the
Cloud Service Mesh pricing . The
CA Service isn't included in the base Cloud Service Mesh price and is
charged separately . Additionally,
CA Service comes with an
explicit SLA , but the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority does not.
Istio CA
We recommend that you use Istio CA if you meet the following criteria:
Your mesh already uses Istio CA and you do not require the benefits enabled by
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority or CA Service.
You require a custom root CA.
You have off-Google Cloud workloads where a
Google Cloud-managed CA service is not acceptable.
Prepare gateway configuration
Cloud Service Mesh gives you the option to deploy and manage gateways as part of your
service mesh. A gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the
mesh receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. Gateways are Envoy
proxies that provide you with fine-grained control over traffic entering and
leaving the mesh.
asmcli doesn't install the istio-ingressgateway . We recommend that you
deploy and manage the control plane and gateways separately. For more
information, see Installing and upgrading gateways .
