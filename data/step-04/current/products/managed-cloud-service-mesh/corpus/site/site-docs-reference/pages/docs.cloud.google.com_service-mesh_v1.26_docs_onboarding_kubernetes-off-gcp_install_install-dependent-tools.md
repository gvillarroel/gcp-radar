Install dependent tools and verify cluster
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
This page shows you how to prepare your environment and cluster to install
in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh for Kubernetes workloads off Google Cloud.
Install required tools
You can run asmcli on Cloud Shell
or on your local machine running Linux. Cloud Shell pre-installs all
the required tools.
Note: macOS isn't supported.
If you are running asmcli locally, make sure you have the following tools
installed:
The Google Cloud CLI
The standard command-line tools: awk , curl , grep , sed , and tr
git
kubectl
jq
(Optional, in order to test connectivity) netcat ( nc )
Configure gcloud
Do the following steps even if you are using Cloud Shell.
Authenticate with the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud auth login --project PROJECT_ID
Update the components:
gcloud components update
Set the current context to your user cluster:
Set your kubectl context to point to your off-Google Cloud cluster, according
to platform-specific instructions.
Note: You can also use service account impersonation by configuring your gcloud
config before running the tool. Run the command gcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account SA-NAME @ GCP-PROJECT .iam.gserviceaccount.com . To unset the impersonation after you've installed
Cloud Service Mesh, run gcloud config unset auth/impersonate_service_account . For
more information, see gcloud config .
Download asmcli
This section describes how to download the asmcli .
Download the version that installs Cloud Service Mesh 1.26.8 to
the current working directory:
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/csm-artifacts/asm/asmcli_1.26 > asmcli
Note: We recommend that you always download the latest version of
asmcli when installing Cloud Service Mesh. The command in the previous
step downloads the latest version.
Expected output:
% Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current
Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed
100 167k 100 167k 0 0 701k 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 701k
Make the script executable:
chmod +x asmcli
Grant cluster admin permissions
Ensure you have set the context to your user cluster:
Note: To check existing contexts, run kubectl config get-contexts .
kubectl config use-context CONTEXT
Grant cluster admin permissions to your user account (your Google Cloud login
email address). You need these permissions to create the necessary
role based access control (RBAC)
rules for Cloud Service Mesh:
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
--clusterrole=cluster-admin \
--user= USER_ACCOUNT
Validate project and cluster
You can run asmcli validate to make sure that your project and cluster are
setup as required to install Cloud Service Mesh. With this option, asmcli
doesn't make any changes to your project or cluster, and it doesn't install
Cloud Service Mesh.
asmcli validates that:
Your environment has the
required tools .
The cluster meets the
minimum requirements .
You have the required permissions
on the specified project.
The project has all the
required Google APIs
enabled.
By default, asmcli downloads and extracts the installation file and
downloads the
asm
configuration package from GitHub to a temp directory. Before exiting,
asmcli outputs a message that provides the name of the temp directory.
We recommend that you specify a directory for the downloads with the
--output_dir DIR_PATH option. The --output_dir
option makes it convenient for you to use the istioctl command-line tool. You
might need istioctl for
troubleshooting configuration issues .
Additionally, the configuration files to enable optional features using asmcli
are included in the asm/istio/options directory.
Run the following command to validate your configuration and download the
installation file and asm package to the OUTPUT_DIR
directory.
Use the following command to run asmcli validate on the following platforms:
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware, Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for bare metal, GKE on AWS (deprecated),
GKE on Azure (deprecated), Amazon EKS (deprecated), and Microsoft AKS (deprecated).
Caution: GKE on Azure
and GKE on AWS
are deprecated and will shut down on March 17, 2027.
Cloud Service Mesh support for
attached clusters , including Amazon EKS clusters and Microsoft AKS clusters,
is deprecated and will shut down March 17, 2027.
Set the current context to your user cluster:
kubectl config use-context CLUSTER_NAME
Run the following command to validate your configuration and download the
installation file and asm package to the OUTPUT_DIR
directory:
./asmcli validate \
--kubeconfig KUBECONFIG_FILE \
--fleet_id FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
--output_dir DIR_PATH \
--platform multicloud
--kubeconfig The path to the kubeconfig
You can specify either a relative path or a full path. The environment
variable $PWD doesn't work here.
--fleet_id The project ID of the
fleet host project .
asmcli validate checks that the cluster is registered to the specified
fleet.
--output_dir Include this option to specify a directory
where asmcli downloads the asm package and extracts the
installation file, which contains istioctl , samples, and manifests.
Otherwise asmcli downloads the files to a tmp directory.
You can specify either a relative path or a full path. The environment
variable $PWD doesn't work here.
--platform multicloud Specifies that the platform is something
other than Google Cloud, such as on-premises or multi-cloud.
On success, asmcli outputs the following:
asmcli: Setting up necessary files...
asmcli: Using asm_kubeconfig as the kubeconfig...
asmcli: Checking installation tool dependencies...
asmcli: Fetching/writing GCP credentials to kubeconfig file...
asmcli: Verifying connectivity (10s)...
asmcli: kubeconfig set to asm_kubeconfig
asmcli: using context gke_example-project-12345_us-central1_cluster-2
asmcli: Getting account information...
asmcli: Downloading ASM..
asmcli: Downloading ASM kpt package...
fetching package "/asm" from "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-service-mesh-packages" to "asm"
asmcli: Checking required APIs...
asmcli: Checking for project example-project-12345...
asmcli: Reading labels for us-central1/cluster-2...
asmcli: Checking for istio-system namespace...
asmcli: Confirming node pool requirements for example-project-12345/us-central1/cluster-2...
asmcli: Checking Istio installations...
asmcli: [WARNING]: There is no way to validate that the meshconfig API has been initialized.
asmcli: [WARNING]: This needs to happen once per GCP project. If the API has not been initialized
asmcli: [WARNING]: for example-project-12345, please re-run this tool with the --enable_gcp_components
asmcli: [WARNING]: flag. Otherwise, installation will succeed but Anthos Service Mesh
asmcli: [WARNING]: will not function correctly.
asmcli: Successfully validated all requirements to install ASM.
If one of the tests fails the validation, asmcli outputs an error message.
For example, if your project doesn't have all of the required Google APIs
enabled, you see the following error:
ERROR: One or more APIs are not enabled. Please enable them and retry, or run
`asmcli` with the '--enable_gcp_apis' flag to allow `asmcli` to enable them
on your behalf.
If you got an error message about needing to run asmcli with an
enablement flag ,
you have the following options:
Include the specific flag from the error message or the --enable_all
flag when running asmcli to do the actual installation.
If you prefer, you can update your project and cluster yourself before
running asmcli as described in
Set up your project and GKE cluster yourself .
Note that asmcli validate doesn't allow any enablement flags because it only
validates that your project and cluster are ready for installation.
Inspect cluster install and upgrade requirements
Before upgrading you should check that your configuration is compatible with
the new version of Cloud Service Mesh.
Change to the directory that you specified in --output_dir .
Run the following command to inspect the Kubernetes cluster for install and
upgrade requirements. Make sure you use the version of istioctl distributed
with the new Cloud Service Mesh version.
istioctl experimental precheck
