Request proxy logs
The Cloud Service Mesh pages provide links to two different types of logs in
Cloud Logging:
Access logs (also known as Envoy logs) and
Traffic logs (also
known as Google Cloud Observability access logs).
Access logs
Enable access logs
The steps required to enable access logs depend on your Cloud Service Mesh type,
either managed or in-cluster:
Managed
Follow the instructions to
enable access logs in managed Cloud Service Mesh .
In-cluster
Follow the instructions to
enable access logs in in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh .
View access logs
To view access logs in the
Logs Explorer :
Navigate to the Logs Explorer:
Go to the Logs Explorer
Select the appropriate Google Cloud project.
Run the following query:
resource . type = "k8s_container" \
resource . labels . container_name = "istio-proxy"
resource . labels . cluster_name = " CLUSTER_NAME " \
resource . labels . namespace_name = " NAMESPACE_NAME " \
resource . labels . pod_name = " POD_NAME "
Traffic logs
Enable traffic logs
Traffic logs are enabled by default,
unless Cloud Service Mesh is installed on Google Distributed Cloud with Istio CA (previously known as Citadel) .
To enable traffic logs on Google Distributed Cloud with Istio CA
when installing in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh ,
then use the flag --option stackdriver . Alternatively, you can enable traffic
logs on Google Distributed Cloud with Istio CA
after installing in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh .
View traffic logs
View traffic logs in the Logs Explorer
To view traffic logs in the
Logs Explorer :
Navigate to the Logs Explorer:
Go to the Logs Explorer
Select the appropriate Google Cloud project.
Run the following query depending on whether you are viewing client or server
access logs:
Server logs
resource.labels.cluster_name=" CLUSTER_NAME " logName="projects/ PROJECT_NAME /logs/server-accesslog-stackdriver"
Client logs
resource.labels.cluster_name=" CLUSTER_NAME " logName="projects/ PROJECT_NAME /logs/client-accesslog-stackdriver"
View traffic logs in the Anthos Service Mesh page
To view traffic logs in the Cloud Service Mesh page for a Service during a specified
time span, follow these steps:
In Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Service Mesh page.
Go to the Cloud Service Mesh page
Under Services , select the name of the Service you want to inspect.
Go to the Metrics page.
Specify a time span from the Time Span dropdown menu or
set a custom span with the timeline .
Click View traffic logs .
The traffic log is named as server-accesslog-stackdriver and is attached to
the corresponding monitored resource
( k8s_container or
gce_instance ) your service is
using. The traffic log contains the following information:
HTTP request properties, such as ID, URL, size, latency, and common headers.
Source and destination workload information, such as name, namespace,
identity, and common labels.
If tracing is enabled, trace information, such as sampling, trace ID, and
span ID.
An example log entry looks like the following:
{
insertId: "1awb4hug5pos2qi"

Interpret Anthos Service Mesh telemetry
The following sections explain how to check the status of your mesh and review
the various telemetries that contain helpful details to assist your troubleshooting.
Interpret control plane metrics
When installing Cloud Service Mesh with the in-cluster control plane, istiod
exports metrics to Google Cloud Observability for monitoring, by default.
istiod prefixes these metrics with istio.io/control and give insights into
the control plane state, such as number of proxies connected to each control
plane instance, configuration events, pushes and validations.
Observe or troubleshoot the control plane, using the following steps.
Load a sample dashboard:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/monitoring-dashboard-samples && cd monitoring-dashboard-samples/dashboards && git checkout servicemesh
Install the Cloud Service Mesh dashboard:
gcloud monitoring dashboards create --config-from-file=dashboards/servicemesh/anthos-service-mesh-control-plane-monitoring.json
Look for a dashboard named Istio Control Plane Dashboard in the list.
For more information, see
Viewing the installed dashboard .
For the full list of metrics available, see
Exported metrics .
Diagnose configuration delays
The following steps explain how to use the pilot_proxy_convergence_time metric
to diagnose a delay between a configuration change and all proxies converging.
Run a shell command in a pod:
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=pilot -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}' -n istio-system) -n istio-system -c istio-proxy -- curl -s
Access localhost:15014 and grep for convergence in metrics:
curl http://localhost:15014/metrics | grep convergence
Interpret Google Cloud Observability access logs
The following information explains how to use the Google Cloud Observability
access logs to troubleshoot connection problems. Google Cloud Observability
access/traffic logs are enabled by default.
Cloud Service Mesh exports data into Google Cloud Observability access logs that can
help you debug the following types of problems:
Traffic flow and failures
End-to-end request routing
Google Cloud Observability access logs are enabled by default for Cloud Service Mesh
installations on Google Kubernetes Engine. You can enable Google Cloud Observability
access logs by re-running asmcli install . Use the same options that you
originally installed but omit the custom overlay that disabled Stackdriver.
There are two types of access logs:
Server access logs give a server-side view of requests. They are located
under server-accesslog-stackdriver , attached to the k8s_container monitored
resource. Use the following URL syntax to
display server-side access logs:
https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer?advancedFilter=logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/server-accesslog-stackdriver"&project= PROJECT_ID
Client access logs give a client-side view of requests. They are located under
client-accesslog-stackdriver , attached to the k8s_pod monitored resource.
Use the following URL syntax to display client-side access logs:
https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer?advancedFilter=logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/client-accesslog-stackdriver"&project= PROJECT_ID
Access logs contain the following information:
HTTP request properties, such as ID, URL, size, latency, and common headers.
Source and destination workload information, such as name, namespace, identity, and common labels.
Source and destination canonical service and revision information.
If tracing is enabled, the logs contain trace information, such as sampling, trace ID, and span ID.
The information displayed in the Google Cloud Observability access logs
originates from Envoy access logs, when you enable them in the Istio
configuration. They contain the following headers:
route_name
upstream_cluster
X-Envoy-Original-Path
X-Envoy-Original-Host
This is an example log entry:

}
You can use this log in various ways:
Integrate with Cloud Trace, which is an optional feature in Cloud Service Mesh.
Export traffic logs to BigQuery, where you can run queries like
selecting all requests take more than 5 seconds.
Create log-based metrics.
Troubleshoot 404 and 503 errors
Troubleshoot 404 and 503 errors
The following example explains how to use this log to troubleshoot when a
request fails with a 404 or 503 response code.
In the client access log, search for an entry like the following:
httpRequest: {
requestMethod: "GET"
requestUrl: ":// IP_ADDRESS /src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php"
requestSize: "2088"
status: 404
responseSize: "75"
remoteIp: "10.168.0.26:34165"
serverIp: "10.36.3.149:8080"
latency: "0.000371440s"
protocol: "http"
}
Navigate to the labels in the access log entry. Find
the response_flag field that looks like the following:
response_flag: "NR"
The NR value is an acronym for NoRoute , which means no route was found for the
destination or there was no matching filter chain for a downstream
connection. Similarly, you can use the response_flag label to troubleshoot
503 errors also.
If you see 503 errors in both the client and server access logs, check that
the port names set for each service match the name of the protocol in use
between them. For example, if a golang binary client connects to a golang server
using HTTP, but the port is named http2 , the protocol will not auto-negotiate
correctly.
For more information, see
response flags .
Interpret access logs
The following steps explain how to use the access logs (also known as Envoy
proxy logs) to show traffic between both ends of a connection for
troubleshooting purposes.
Access logs are useful for diagnosing issues like:
Traffic flow and failures
End-to-end request routing
Access logs are not enabled by default in Cloud Service Mesh and can only be enabled
globally across the entire mesh.
Note: The
Google Cloud Observability logs are the preferred
logs for most troubleshooting scenarios. However, if the issue persists, enable
access logs to troubleshoot further.
You can troubleshoot connection/request failures by generating activity in your
application that triggers an HTTP request, then inspecting the associated request
in the source or destination logs.
If you trigger a request appears and it appears in the source proxy logs, it
indicates that iptables traffic redirection is working correctly and the Envoy
proxy is handling traffic. If you see errors in the logs, generate an Envoy
configuration dump and check the Envoy cluster configuration to ensure it is
correct. If you see the request but the log has no errors, check the destination
proxy logs instead.
If the request appears in the destination proxy logs, it indicates that the mesh
itself is working correctly. If you see an error instead, run an Envoy
configuration dump and verify the correct values for the traffic port set in
the listener configuration.
If the problem persists after performing the previous steps, Envoy might be
unable to auto-negotiate the protocol between the sidecar and its application
pod. Ensure that the Kubernetes service port name, for example http-80 ,
matches the protocol that the application uses.
Use Logs Explorer to query logs
You can use the Logs Explorer interface
to query specific access logs. For example, to query all requests that have
MULTUAL_TLS enabled and use protocol grpc , append following to the server
access logs query:
labels.protocol="grpc" labels.service_authentication_policy="MULTUAL_TLS"
Set an access log policy
To configure proxy logging for managed Cloud Service Mesh, see
Envoy access logs .
To set an access log policy for Cloud Service Mesh with the in-cluster control
plane:
Create an IstioOperator custom overlay file that includes the applicable
AccessLogPolicyConfig
values for your scenario.
Pass this file to asmcli using the --custom_overlay option to update
the in-cluster control plane configuration. For information on running
asmcli install with a custom overlay file, see
Install with optional features .
Caution: If you customized the previous installation, you need the same
customizations when you reinstall the control plane to include the file
with the AccessLogPolicyConfig settings. Omitting an overlay file results
in a successful installation; however, your service mesh has a different
configuration than you intended because the omitted values are reset back to
the defaults when the control plane is redeployed.
View service or workload-specific information
If you have an issue with a specific service or workload rather than a mesh-wide
problem, inspect the individual Envoy proxies and gather relevant information
from them. To gather information about a particular workload and its proxies,
you can use pilot-agent :
kubectl exec POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE_NAME -c istio-proxy -- pilot-agent request GET SCOPE
In the example, SCOPE is one of the following:
certs - Certificates within the Envoy instance
clusters - Clusters with Envoy configured
config_dump - Dumps the Envoy configuration
listeners - Listeners with Envoy configured
logging - View and change logging settings
stats - Envoy statistics
stats/prometheus - Envoy statistics as Prometheus records
Note: config_dump and stats are the options that are most likely to produce
actionable information.
View proxy socket states
You can directly examine the state of Envoy proxy sockets by using the following
process.
Display a list of established sockets, including sockets in the TIME_WAIT
state, which can negatively affect scalability if their count is high:
kubectl exec POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE_NAME -c istio-proxy -- ss -anopim
Display a summary of socket statistics:
kubectl exec POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE_NAME -c istio-proxy -- ss -s
For more information, see An Introduction to the ss Command .
istio-proxy and istio-init logs
In addition, retrieve the istio-proxy logs and review its contents for any
errors that might suggest the cause of the problem:
kubectl logs POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE_NAME -c istio-proxy
You can do the same for the init container:
kubectl logs POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE_NAME -c istio-init
