Automate TLS certificate management for Cloud Service Mesh
ingress gateway using Certificate Authority Service
This tutorial shows platform operators how to use the
Certificate Authority Service (CA Service) issuer for the cert-manager tool
to automate TLS certificate management for the Cloud Service Mesh ingress gateway.
The certificates enable the ingress gateway to terminate HTTPS and other TLS and
mTLS traffic originating from clients in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) but
outside the service mesh. The tutorial assumes basic familiarity with Kubernetes
and TLS certificates.
Introduction
Cloud Service Mesh provisions TLS certificates to every workload in the service mesh.
These certificates enable encrypted and
mutually authenticated TLS (mTLS)
communication between workloads in the service mesh. One of the supported CAs
issues and signs the certificates.
However, Cloud Service Mesh doesn't automatically provision certificates to the
ingress gateway for traffic entering the service mesh.
A common solution is to use the open source cert-manager
tool to automate the management of ingress gateway certificates.
The cert-manager tool requests certificates from an issuer ,
which represents a certificate authority (CA) .
CA Service is a
Google Cloud service that enables you to create your own private CA. The
cert-manager tool can request certificates from CA Service by
using the open source
external issuer for CA Service .
A private CA can issue TLS certificates that authenticate and encrypt traffic
inside an internal network. Cloud Service Mesh ingress gateways are often set
up to allow incoming traffic from clients that are inside your
VPC but outside the service mesh. For internal network traffic,
you can use a private CA in CA Service to issue certificates for
the ingress gateway.
This tutorial shows you how to set up the cert-manager tool and the
CA Service issuer to automate TLS certificate provisioning and
renewal for the ingress gateway. the cert-manager tool provisions certificates
as
Kubernetes Secret resources of type TLS .
When the cert-manager tool renews a certificate, it updates the Secret resource
with a new certificate. The ingress gateway runs the
Envoy Proxy , and it supports
Envoy's secret discovery service (SDS) .
SDS enables the ingress gateway to start using a new certificate without
requiring an administrator to restart or reload the process.
Sidecar proxies that are part of the mesh can obtain TLS certificates from
either CA Service or Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority. In this
tutorial, you use CA Service for both sidecar proxy and ingress
gateway certificates. This enables you to use one root CA for all TLS
certificates.
The following diagram shows the resources you provision in this tutorial.
You provision an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer for the ingress gateway. The
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer is not a proxy, so it
doesn't terminate TCP connections or perform TLS handshakes. Instead, it routes
connections to the pods of the istio-ingressgateway deployment.
The hello-example-com-credential Secret contains a certificate and a private
key. The hello gateway configures the pods of the istio-ingressgateway
deployment to use this certificate and private key to perform TLS handshakes for
requests with the hostname hello.example.com .
The pods of the google-cas-issuer deployment in the cert-manager namespace
request certificates from the CA that you create in CA Service. You create a
Identity and Access Management policy binding that allows the ca-service-isser pods
to impersonate a Google service account using
Workload Identity Federation for GKE . You
grant this Google service account permission to request certificates from your
CA in CA Service by creating an IAM policy binding
on your CA pool.

Costs
This tutorial uses the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Cloud Service Mesh
CA Service
Compute Engine
GKE
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage, use the
pricing calculator . New Google Cloud users
might be eligible for a free trial.
When you finish this tutorial, you can avoid ongoing billing by deleting the
resources you created. For more information, see Clean up .
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console,
go to the project selector page ,
and then select or create a project.
Note: If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this
tutorial, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After
you finish this tutorial, you can delete the project, removing all resources
associated with the project.
Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
In the Google Cloud console, go to Cloud Shell .
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a Cloud Shell session
opens and displays a command-line prompt. You use Cloud Shell to run
all the commands in this tutorial.
Set the Google Cloud console project you want to use for this tutorial:
gcloud config set core/project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the project ID of your Cloud
project.
In the Authorize Cloud Shell dialog, click Authorize . By
clicking Authorize , you allow gcloud commands that you run in
Cloud Shell to use your user credentials to authenticate to Google APIs.
Enable the Resource Manager, GKE, GKE Hub,
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, and CA Service APIs:
gcloud services enable \
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
container.googleapis.com \
gkehub.googleapis.com \
meshca.googleapis.com \
privateca.googleapis.com
Note: Enabling the APIs can take up to a minute to complete.
Configure CA Service
In this section, you create a root CA and two subordinate CAs in
CA Service. One subordinate CA issues certificates to the ingress
gateway, and the other subordinate CA issues certificates to sidecar proxies in
the mesh.
For simplicity, you use the same project for the GKE cluster and
the root and subordinate CAs in this tutorial. In your own environment, you can
use a different project for the GKE cluster and the CAs.
Note: In your own environment, you can create a subordinate CA in
CA Service from an existing root CA in your organization.
If you use an existing root CA, you do not need to create a root CA in
CA Service. We recommend you consult the documentation on how to
create a subordinate CA from an external CA .
In Cloud Shell, create a CA pool to use for the root CA:
gcloud privateca pools create ROOT_CA_POOL \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--tier enterprise
ROOT_CA_POOL is the name of the CA pool. For example,
root-ca-pool-tutorial .
CA_LOCATION is the location of the CA pool. For
example, us-central1 .
You can list the available CA Service locations using this
command: gcloud privateca locations list
Create and enable a root CA:
gcloud privateca roots create ROOT_CA \
-- auto - enable \
-- key - algorithm ec - p384 - sha384 \
-- location CA_LOCATION \
-- pool ROOT_CA_POOL \
-- subject "CN=Example Root CA, O=Example Organization" \
-- use - preset - profile root_unconstrained
ROOT_CA is the name you want to use for the root
CA. For example, root-ca-tutorial .
Create a CA pool to use for the subordinate CA that issues certificates to
the ingress gateway:
gcloud privateca pools create SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--tier devops
SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS is the name of the
CA pool. For example, subordinate-ca-mtls-pool-gateways-tutorial .
Create and enable the subordinate CA that issues certificates to the ingress
gateway:
gcloud privateca subordinates create SUBORDINATE_CA_GATEWAYS \
--auto-enable \
--issuer-location CA_LOCATION \
--issuer-pool ROOT_CA_POOL \
--key-algorithm ec-p256-sha256 \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--pool SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS \
--subject "CN=Example Gateway mTLS CA, O=Example Organization" \
--use-preset-profile subordinate_mtls_pathlen_0
SUBORDINATE_CA_GATEWAYS is the name you want to
use for the subordinate CA. For example,
subordinate-ca-mtls-gateways-tutorial .
The --use-preset-profile flag configures the subordinate CA to use the
Subordinate mTLS
certificate profile. This profile enables the subordinate CA to issue both
client and server TLS certificates for mTLS.
If you want your ingress gateway to use simple TLS instead of mTLS, your
subordinate CA only needs to issue server TLS certificates. In this case, you
can use the Subordinate server TLS
( subordinate_server_tls_pathlen_0 ) certificate profile instead.
Create a certificate issuance policy :
cat << EOF > policy . yaml
baselineValues :
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
digitalSignature : true
keyEncipherment : true
extendedKeyUsage :
serverAuth : true
clientAuth : true
caOptions :
isCa : false
identityConstraints :
allowSubjectPassthrough : false
allowSubjectAltNamesPassthrough : true
celExpression :
expression : subject_alt_names . all ( san , san . type == URI && san . value . startsWith ( "spiffe:// PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog/ns/" ) )
EOF
This issuance policy constrains CAs to only issue certificates for workloads
in the mesh.
Create a CA pool to use for the subordinate CA that issues certificates to
the sidecar proxies in the mesh. Apply the issuance policy to the CA pool:
gcloud privateca pools create SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_SIDECARS \
--issuance-policy policy.yaml \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--tier devops
SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_SIDECARS is the name of the
CA pool. For example, subordinate-ca-mtls-pool-sidecars-tutorial .
Create and enable the subordinate CA that issues certificates to the sidecar
proxies in the mesh:
gcloud privateca subordinates create SUBORDINATE_CA_SIDECARS \
--auto-enable \
--issuer-location CA_LOCATION \
--issuer-pool ROOT_CA_POOL \
--key-algorithm ec-p256-sha256 \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--pool SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_SIDECARS \
--subject "CN=Example Sidecar mTLS CA, O=Example Organization" \
--use-preset-profile subordinate_mtls_pathlen_0
SUBORDINATE_CA_GATEWAYS is the name you want to
use for the subordinate CA. For example,
subordinate-ca-mtls-sidecars-tutorial .
Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster
In Cloud Shell, create a GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
-- enable - ip - alias \
-- num - nodes 4 \
-- release - channel regular \
-- scopes cloud - platform \
-- workload - pool PROJECT_ID . svc.id.goog \
-- zone ZONE
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name you want to use for
the cluster. For example, asm-ingress-cert-manager-ca-service .
Replace ZONE with the zone you want to use for the
cluster. For example, us-central1-f .
Note the following about the command:
The --release-channel flag selects the
GKE release channel
for the cluster.
Both Cloud Service Mesh and the CA Service issuer for the
cert-manager tool require that you set the cloud-platform scope on the
cluster nodes.
The --workload-pool argument enables Workload Identity Federation for GKE, which
allows the CA Service issuer Kubernetes service account to
impersonate a Google service account. This impersonation means that the
CA Service issuer pods can access the
CA Service API without downloading a key file
for the Google service account.
Grant cluster administrator permissions
to your user account:
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
--clusterrole cluster-admin \
--user $(gcloud config get-value core/account)
You need the permissions provided by the Kubernetes cluster-admin
ClusterRole to create the role-based access control (RBAC)
rules for Cloud Service Mesh, and to install the cert-manager tool.
Install the Anthos Service Mesh control plane
In this tutorial, you install managed Cloud Service Mesh
for a GKE cluster on Google Cloud, with all resources in
one project. In your own environment, you can apply the solution described in
this document using either managed Cloud Service Mesh or an
in-cluster control plane .
Cloud Service Mesh provides a range of installation options for different scenarios.
After completing this tutorial, we recommend that you review the
installation guide
to select the option that best fits your environment.
In Cloud Shell, download the asmcli
installation tool:
curl --location --output asmcli https://storage.googleapis.com/csm-artifacts/asm/asmcli_1.28
chmod +x asmcli
You use asmcli to install the Cloud Service Mesh control plane.
Install the Cloud Service Mesh control plane:
. / asmcli install \
-- ca gcp_cas \
-- ca_pool projects / PROJECT_ID / locations / CA_LOCATION / caPools / SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_SIDECARS \
-- cluster_location ZONE \
-- cluster_name CLUSTER_NAME \
-- enable_all \
-- enable_registration \
-- fleet_id PROJECT_ID \
-- managed \
-- output_dir asm - files \
-- project_id PROJECT_ID \
-- verbose
The --ca gcp_cas and --ca_pool flags configures the Cloud Service Mesh
control plane to
use the sidecar CA pool in CA Service to issue certificates to sidecar proxies in the mesh .
The --enable_registration flag
registers the GKE cluster
to the fleet in the project
specified by the --fleet_id flag. In this tutorial, the
GKE cluster and the fleet use the same project.
The --managed flag sets up a
managed Cloud Service Mesh control plane .
The --output_dir flag specifies a directory that asmcli uses to
download files and configurations necessary for installing Cloud Service Mesh.
You use these files later in the tutorial.
Note: To view all the available asmcli options, run
./asmcli --help --verbose .
Installation takes several minutes. When the installation is complete, you
see the following output:
asmcli: Successfully installed ASM.
Install the ingress gateway
In Cloud Shell, create a Kubernetes namespace for the ingress
gateway:
kubectl create namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
GATEWAY_NAMESPACE is the name of the
namespace you want to use for the ingress gateway. For example,
istio-ingress .
Reserve a static internal IP address
to use for the ingress gateway internal passthrough Network Load Balancer:
LOAD_BALANCER_IP = $ ( gcloud compute addresses create \
asm - ingress - gateway - ilb \
-- region REGION \
-- subnet default \
-- format ' value ( address ) ' )
Replace REGION with the region that contains the
zone or zones that your GKE cluster nodes use. For example,
if your cluster uses the us-central1-f zone, replace
REGION with us-central1 .
This command reserves an IP address from the default subnet in the region you
specify.
Create an operator manifest
for the ingress gateway:
cat << EOF > ingressgateway - operator . yaml
apiVersion : install . istio . io / v1alpha1
kind : IstioOperator
metadata :
name : ingressgateway - operator
annotations :
config . kubernetes . io / local - config : "true"
spec :
profile : empty
revision : asm - managed
components :
ingressGateways :
- name : istio - ingressgateway
namespace : GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
enabled : true
k8s :
overlays :
- apiVersion : apps / v1
kind : Deployment
name : istio - ingressgateway
patches :
- path : spec . template . metadata . annotations
value :
inject . istio . io / templates : gateway
- path : spec . template . metadata . labels . sidecar \ . istio \ . io / inject
value : "true"
- path : spec . template . spec . containers [ name : istio - proxy ]
value :
name : istio - proxy
image : auto
service :
loadBalancerIP : $ LOAD_BALANCER_IP
serviceAnnotations :
networking . gke . io / load - balancer - type : Internal
networking . gke . io / internal - load - balancer - allow - global - access : "true"
EOF
Note the following about the operator manifest :
The revision field specifies the managed Cloud Service Mesh release channel to
use for the data plane. Change the value of this field if you use the
Rapid or Stable release channels
for the control plane.
The annotation , label , and image specified in the overlays section
enable
auto-injection of proxy configuration for the ingress gateway deployment .
The loadBalancerIP field specifies
the IP address to use for the load balancer .
If you remove this field from the manifest, the load balancer uses an
ephemeral IP address .
The service annotation
networking.gke.io/load-balancer-type: Internal
on the ingress gateway means that GKE provisions an
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer in front of the
ingress gateway pods. If you remove this annotation, GKE
instead provisions an
external passthrough Network Load Balancer .
The optional service annotation
networking.gke.io/internal-load-balancer-allow-global-access: "true"
allows clients from any region in your VPC to access the
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer. If you remove this annotation, the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
only accepts traffic from clients in the same region in your
VPC.
Create the ingress gateway installation manifest using the operator manifest
and the istioctl
tool that the asmcli script downloaded when you installed the control plane:
./asm-files/istioctl manifest generate \
--filename ingressgateway-operator.yaml \
--output ingressgateway
Install the ingress gateway :
kubectl apply --recursive --filename ingressgateway/
Install the cert-manager tool
In Cloud Shell, download and apply the cert-manager tool
installation manifest:
CERT_MANAGER_VERSION = v1 . 5.4
curl -- location -- output cert - manager . yaml "https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/${CERT_MANAGER_VERSION}/cert-manager.yaml"
kubectl apply -- filename cert - manager . yaml
Installing the cert-manager tool takes about a minute to complete.
Install the CA Service issuer controller
The CA Service issuer controller
enables the cert-manager tool to request certificates using
CA Service. The controller uses the cert-manager tool
external issuer
extension mechanism.
In Cloud Shell, create a Google service account :
gcloud iam service-accounts create CAS_ISSUER_GSA \
--display-name "CA Service issuer for cert-manager"
CAS_ISSUER_GSA is the name of the Google service
account. For example, cert-manager-ca-service-issuer .
The Certificate Authority Service issuer controller uses this Google service
account to authenticate to the Certificate Authority Service APIs .
Create an Identity and Access Management policy binding that allows the
Certificate Authority Service issuer controller Google service account to request
certificates from the CA pool that contains your subordinate CA:
gcloud privateca pools add - iam - policy - binding SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--member "serviceAccount: CAS_ISSUER_GSA @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role roles/privateca.certificateRequester
Download the Certificate Authority Service issuer controller installation manifest:
CAS_ISSUER_VERSION = v0 . 5.3
curl -- location -- output ca - service - issuer . yaml "https://github.com/jetstack/google-cas-issuer/releases/download/${CAS_ISSUER_VERSION}/google-cas-issuer-${CAS_ISSUER_VERSION}.yaml"
Create an IAM policy binding to allow the
ksa-google-cas-issuer Kubernetes service account in the cert-manager
namespace to impersonate the Google service account (GSA) using
Workload Identity Federation for GKE :
gcloud iam service - accounts add - iam - policy - binding \
CAS_ISSUER_GSA @ PROJECT_ID . iam.gserviceaccount.com \
-- member "serviceAccount: PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog[cert-manager/ksa-google-cas-issuer]" \
-- role roles / iam . workloadIdentityUser
The CA Service issuer controller pods use the
ksa-google-cas-issuer Kubernetes service account.
Install the CA Service issuer controller in your
GKE cluster:
kubectl apply --filename ca-service-issuer.yaml
Add the Workload Identity Federation for GKE annotation iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account to
the Kubernetes service account used by the CA Service issuer
controller pods:
kubectl annotate serviceaccount ksa - google - cas - issuer --namespace cert-manager \
"iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account= CAS_ISSUER_GSA @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com"
This annotation informs GKE that the Kubernetes service
account can impersonate the Google service account to access Google APIs.
Create a certificate issuer
In Cloud Shell, create and apply a GoogleCASIssuer
manifest:
cat << EOF > gateway-cas-issuer.yaml
apiVersion: cas-issuer.jetstack.io/v1beta1
kind: GoogleCASIssuer
metadata:
name: gateway-cas-issuer
namespace: GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
spec:
caPoolId: SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS
location: CA_LOCATION
project: PROJECT_ID
EOF
kubectl apply --filename gateway-cas-issuer.yaml
The issuer enables the cert-manager tool to provision certificates from your
subordinate CA pool in your ingress gateway namespace
Note: You can create a cluster-scoped issuer
instead of a namespace-scoped issuer. A cluster-scoped issuer can provision
certificates for any namespace in the Kubernetes cluster.
Deploy a sample application
In this section, you verify that the cert-manager tool can use the
CA Service issuer to obtain certificates from
CA Service. To verify, you deploy a sample application with
request routing configuration and a certificate for the ingress gateway.
In Cloud Shell, create a namespace for the sample application
resources:
cat << EOF > sample-app-namespace.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
name: APP_NAMESPACE
annotations:
mesh.cloud.google.com/proxy: '{"managed":"true"}'
labels:
istio.io/rev: asm-managed
EOF
kubectl apply --filename sample-app-namespace.yaml
APP_NAMESPACE is the name of the namespace for
the sample application. For example, sample-app .
The annotation mesh.cloud.google.com/proxy enables the
managed data plane
for the namespace.
The label istio.io/rev: asm-managed selects the
Regular release channel
for the managed data plane in the sample application namespace. Change the
value of this label if you use the
Rapid or Stable release channels .
Create a Deployment resource for the sample application:
cat << EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: hello
namespace: APP_NAMESPACE
labels:
app: hello
spec:
replicas: 1
selector:
matchLabels:
app: hello
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: hello
spec:
containers:
- image: gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
name: hello-app
ports:
- containerPort: 8080
EOF
kubectl apply --filename deployment.yaml
Create a Service resource for the sample application:
cat << EOF > service . yaml
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
name : SERVICE_NAME
namespace : APP_NAMESPACE
spec :
ports :
- name : http - hello
port : 8080
selector :
app : hello
type : ClusterIP
EOF
kubectl apply -- filename service . yaml
SERVICE_NAME is the name of the service. For
example, hello .
Create a Certificate resource for the domain name hello.example.com using
the certificate issuer:
cat << EOF > certificate.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
name: hello-example-com-certificate
namespace: GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
spec:
secretName: hello-example-com-credential
commonName: hello.example.com
dnsNames:
- hello.example.com
duration: 24h
renewBefore: 8h
issuerRef:
group: cas-issuer.jetstack.io
kind: GoogleCASIssuer
name: gateway-cas-issuer
EOF
kubectl apply --filename certificate.yaml
The Certificate namespace must match the ingress gateway namespace.
Typically, only platform administrators can change resources in this
namespace, since changes can affect the entire service mesh. the cert-manager
tool creates the Secret resource for the TLS certificate in the same
namespace. This means that application administrators do not need to have
access to the ingress gateway namespace.
You can add additional hostnames in the dnsNames list in the Certificate.
These hostnames are included in the certificate as
Subject Alternate Names (SANs) .
Create a Gateway
resource for the sample application:
cat << EOF > gateway.yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
name: GATEWAY_NAME
namespace: GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
spec:
selector:
istio: ingressgateway
servers:
- hosts:
- APP_NAMESPACE /hello.example.com
port:
name: https-hello
number: 443
protocol: HTTPS
tls:
credentialName: hello-example-com-credential
mode: MUTUAL
EOF
kubectl apply --filename gateway.yaml
GATEWAY_NAME is the gateway name. For example,
hello .
The credentialName field in the Gateway matches the secretName field in
the Certificate. the cert-manager tool creates a Kubernetes Secret with the
TLS certificate from CA Service. This certificate enables
the ingress gateway to terminate TLS traffic destined to hello.example.com .
The Gateway manifest specifies MUTUAL
TLS (mTLS). If you want to configure the gateway for regular TLS, set the TLS
mode of the Gateway to SIMPLE instead.
Create a VirtualService resource for the sample application:
cat << EOF > virtual-service.yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: hello
namespace: APP_NAMESPACE
spec:
hosts:
- hello.example.com
gateways:
- GATEWAY_NAMESPACE / GATEWAY_NAME
http:
- route:
- destination:
host: SERVICE_NAME
port:
number: 8080
EOF
kubectl apply --filename virtual-service.yaml
The Gateway and VirtualService use different namespaces. This common pattern
restricts changes to host-based routing in the Gateway to platform
administrators who have permissions to change resources in the ingress
gateway namespace.
Application administrators with permissions to edit the VirtualService in the
sample application namespace can change routing by other request fields, such
as URL path, without coordinating with platform administrators.
If you want to explore other configuration options, read the API documentation
for the Certificate ,
Gateway ,
and VirtualService
resources.
You can apply authentication and authorization policies to traffic entering the
service mesh through the ingress gateway. To do so, read the documentation for
the Istio PeerAuthentication
and AuthorizationPolicy
APIs.
Verify the solution
In this section, you verify that you can send HTTPS requests using mTLS to the
sample application from outside the service mesh. To verify, you create a
Compute Engine VM instance, request a client TLS certificate from
CA Service, and use this certificate to authenticate the request
to the sample application.
You need SSH access to the VM instance. The default network
includes a
firewall rule that allows SSH access .
If you don't have SSH access, follow the
firewall rules documentation to create a firewall
rule that allows incoming TCP connections on port 22.
Note: If you don't want to create a VM instance with a public IP address, you
can use TCP forwarding with Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) .
This feature enables authenticated and authorized SSH access from outside the
VPC to VM instances that do not have public IP addresses. If you
use this feature, add the --tunnel-through-iap flag to the gcloud compute scp
and gcloud compute ssh commands in this section.
In Cloud Shell, create a Google service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create CLIENT_VM_GSA \
--display-name "CA Service tutorial VM instance service account"
CLIENT_VM_GSA is the name of the Google service
account. For example, cas-tutorial-client .
You assign this Google service account to the Compute Engine VM
instance.
Grant the CA Service Certificate Requester
role on the gateways subordinate CA pool to the Google service account:
gcloud privateca pools add - iam - policy - binding SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--member "serviceAccount: CLIENT_VM_GSA @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role roles/privateca.certificateRequester
This role provides permissions to request certificates from the CA pool.
Create a Compute Engine VM instance in the same VPC as
the GKE cluster:
gcloud compute instances create cas - tutorial - client \
--scopes cloud-platform \
--service-account CLIENT_VM_GSA @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--zone ZONE
The VM instance requires the cloud-platform scope to access the
CA Service API .
Save the IP address of the ingress gateway internal passthrough Network Load Balancer to a file:
kubectl get services istio - ingressgateway \
-- namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE \
-- output jsonpath = '{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' > ilb - ip . txt
Save the public key certificate of your root CA to a file:
gcloud privateca roots describe ROOT_CA \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--pool ROOT_CA_POOL \
--format 'value(pemCaCertificates)' > root-ca-cert.pem
Note: You do not need to treat this certificate as a secret credential. It
contains only the public key of the root CA, not the private key. All clients
using your service receive a copy of this certificate as part of the TLS
handshake.
Copy the root CA certificate and the file containing the IP address of the
ingress gateway internal passthrough Network Load Balancer to the VM instance:
gcloud compute scp root-ca-cert.pem ilb-ip.txt cas-tutorial-client:~ \
--zone ZONE
Connect to the VM instance using SSH:
gcloud compute ssh cas-tutorial-client --zone ZONE
Run the rest of the commands in this section from the SSH session.
Install the ca-certificates and coreutils packages, and the curl ,
openssl , and jq
command-line tools:
sudo apt-get update --yes
sudo apt-get install --yes ca-certificates coreutils curl jq openssl
Create a key pair for the client TLS certificate:
openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem
Query the metadata server to get the email
address of the Google service account identity attached to the VM instance:
GSA_EMAIL=$(curl --silent --header "Metadata-Flavor: Google" http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/email)
Create a JSON file that you use as the request body when
requesting a client TLS certificate from the Certificate Authority Service API :
cat << EOF > request.json
{
"config": {
"publicKey": {
"format": "PEM",
"key": "$(base64 --wrap 0 public-key.pem)"
},
"subjectConfig": {
"subject": {
"commonName": "$(hostname --short)",
"organization": "Example Organization"
},
"subjectAltName": {
"dnsNames": [
"$(hostname --fqdn)"
],
"emailAddresses": [
"$GSA_EMAIL"
]
}
},
"x509Config": {
"caOptions": {
"isCa": false
},
"keyUsage": {
"baseKeyUsage": {
"digitalSignature": true,
"keyEncipherment": true
},
"extendedKeyUsage": {
"clientAuth": true
}
}
}
},
"lifetime": "86400s"
}
EOF
To learn more about the fields in the config section, see the
CertificateConfig
type in the CA Service API documentation.
Request an OAuth 2.0 access token
from the metadata server :
TOKEN=$(curl --silent --header "Metadata-Flavor: Google" http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token | jq --raw-output ".access_token")
This access token provides the permissions granted to the Google service
account that is attached to the VM instance.
Request a client TLS certificate from the CA Service API and
store the response body in a file:
curl --silent --request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data @request.json \
--output response.json \
"https://privateca.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ CA_LOCATION /caPools/ SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS /certificates"
The command uses the access token to authenticate the API request.
Save the client certificate and certificate chain to a file:
jq --raw-output --join-output ".pemCertificate , .pemCertificateChain[]" response.json > client-cert-chain.pem
Use curl to send an HTTPS request from the VM instance to the sample
application:
curl --cert client-cert-chain.pem --key private-key.pem \
--cacert root-ca-cert.pem \
--resolve hello.example.com:443:$(cat ilb-ip.txt) \
--silent https://hello.example.com | head -n1
The output looks like this:
Hello, world!
This response shows that curl successfully sent the HTTPS request using
mTLS. The sample application responded with the message you see in the
terminal output.
The curl command does the following:
The --cert and --key flags instruct curl to use the client TLS
certificate and private key to authenticate the request. The client
certificate file contains the full chain of certificates, from the client
certificate to the root CA.
The --cacert flag instructs curl to verify that the root CA you created
in this tutorial, or one of its subordinate CAs, issued the server
certificate.
If you omit this flag, curl attempts to verify the server certificate
using the default CA bundle of your operating system, such as the
ca-certificates
package on Debian. Verification fails because the default CA bundle does
not include the root CA you created in this tutorial.
The --resolve flag instructs curl to use the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer IP
address as the destination for requests to host hello.example.com on
port 443.
If you omit this flag, curl attempts to use DNS to resolve the
hello.example.com hostname. DNS resolution fails because there is no DNS
entry for this hostname.
In your own environment, we recommend that you create a
DNS A record that points
to the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer IP address ( $LOAD_BALANCER_IP ). Create this
record using Cloud DNS , by following the
documentation on managing records .
The --silent flag suppresses response download progress reporting in the
terminal output.
The command pipes the curl output to head -n1 . The result is that the
output in the terminal only includes the first line of the response body.
Leave the SSH session:
exit
In this section, you requested a client TLS certificate directly from the
CA Service API. In the situation where the client is the egress
gateway of another service mesh in a separate Kubernetes cluster, you can use
the cert-manager tool and the Certificate Authority Service issuer with the same root CA
to provide client certificates to the egress gateway.
In other situations you can use tools such as Hashicorp Vault, Terraform, or
gcloud to request client TLS certificates for workloads outside the service
mesh. For more information, see the CA Service documentation for
sample solutions , and the
gcloud documentation for CA Service.
(Optional) Add CA certificates to trust store
This optional section shows how to add CA certificates to the store of trusted
CA certificates for the Debian distribution of Linux. These instructions also
apply to distributions derived from Debian, such as Ubuntu.
Adding your CA certificates to this store means that you don't need to specify
the location of trusted CA certificates when sending HTTPS requests using curl ,
Python, Go, and Ruby.
Connect to the VM instance using SSH:
gcloud compute ssh cas-tutorial-client --zone ZONE
Run the rest of the commands in this section from the SSH session.
Copy the root CA certificate to the directory
/usr/local/share/ca-certificates , and ensure the file has the extension
.crt :
sudo cp root-ca-cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cas-rootca.crt
Set the file permissions so all users can read the root CA certificate file:
sudo chmod 644 /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cas-rootca.crt
Run the update-ca-certificates
script:
sudo update-ca-certificates
This script adds the certificate to the set of trusted certificates in the
directory /etc/ssl/certs , and to the file
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt .
The output is the following:
Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
1 added, 0 removed; done.
Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...
done.
Use curl to send an HTTPS request from the VM instance to the sample
application:
curl --cert client-cert-chain.pem --key private-key.pem \
--resolve hello.example.com:443:$(cat ilb-ip.txt) \
--silent https://hello.example.com | head -n1
The output looks like this:
Hello, world!
This response shows that curl successfully sent the HTTPS request using
mTLS, and validated the server TLS certificate from the ingress gateway using
the default CA certificate store.
Leave the SSH session:
exit
Troubleshoot
If the CA Service issuer controller doesn't create the TLS
certificate secret, view the logs of the CA Service issuer
controller:
kubectl logs deployment/google-cas-issuer --namespace cert-manager

Clean up
To avoid incurring continuing charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used in this tutorial, you can either delete the project or delete
the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution: Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project
for this tutorial, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost. When you created this project, you might
have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future.
To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com URL,
delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole
project.
In Cloud Shell, delete the project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete the resources
If you want to keep the Google Cloud project you used in this tutorial,
delete the individual resources:
In Cloud Shell, unregister the GKE cluster from
GKE Hub:
gcloud container hub memberships unregister CLUSTER_NAME \
-- gke - cluster ZONE / CLUSTER_NAME
Delete the GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete CLUSTER_NAME \
--zone ZONE --async --quiet
Delete the IAM policy bindings on the subordinate CA pool:
gcloud privateca pools remove - iam - policy - binding SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--member "serviceAccount: CAS_ISSUER_GSA @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role roles/privateca.certificateRequester
gcloud privateca pools remove - iam - policy - binding SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--member "serviceAccount: CLIENT_VM_GSA @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role roles/privateca.certificateRequester
Disable and schedule deletion of the subordinate CAs and the root CA:
gcloud privateca subordinates disable SUBORDINATE_CA_GATEWAYS \
--location CA_LOCATION \
--pool SUBORDINATE_CA_POOL_GATEWAYS \
