Installing and upgrading gateways
Cloud Service Mesh gives you the option to deploy and manage gateways as part of
your service mesh. A gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of
the mesh receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. Gateways are Envoy
proxies that provide you with fine-grained control over traffic entering and
leaving the mesh. Gateways are primarily used to manage ingress
traffic, but you can also configure gateways to manage other types of traffic.
For example:
Egress gateways: An egress gateway lets you configure a dedicated exit node
for the traffic leaving the mesh, letting you limit which services can or should
access external networks, or to enable secure control of egress traffic to add
security to your mesh, for example.
East-west gateways: A proxy for
east-west traffic
to allow service workloads to communicate across cluster boundaries in a
multi-primary mesh on different networks. By default, this gateway will be
public on the Internet.
This page describes best practices for deploying and upgrading the gateway
proxies as well as examples of configuring your own istio-ingressgateway and
istio-egressgateway gateway proxies.
Things like traffic splitting, redirects, and retry logic are possible by
applying a
Gateway
configuration to the gateway proxies. Then instead of adding application-layer
traffic routing (L7) to the same API resource, you bind a
Virtual Service
to the Gateway. This lets you manage gateway traffic like any other data plane
traffic in the service mesh.
You can deploy gateways in different ways and you can choose to use more than
one topology within the same cluster. Refer to
Gateway deployment topologies
in the Istio documentation to learn more about these topologies.
Best practices for deploying gateways
The best practices for deploying gateways depend on whether you are using the
managed data plane or the
unmanaged data plane .
Best practices for managed data plane
Enable the
managed data plane .
Add a managed revision label to a
namespace.
Deploy and manage the control plane and gateways separately.
As a security best practice, we recommended that you deploy gateways in
a different namespace from the control plane.
Use
automatic sidecar injection
(auto-injection) to inject the proxy configuration for the gateways similar
to how you would inject the sidecar proxies for your services.
These best practices:
Ensure your managed gateways are automatically kept up-to-date with the latest
enhancements and security updates.
Offloads management and maintenance of gateway instances to Cloud Service Mesh
managed data plane.
Best practices for unmanaged data plane
Deploy and manage the control plane and gateways separately.
As a security best practice, we recommended that you deploy gateways in
a different namespace from the control plane.
Use
automatic sidecar injection
(auto-injection) to inject the proxy configuration for the gateways similar
to how you would inject the sidecar proxies for your services.
These best practices:
Let your namespace administrators manage gateways without needing
elevated privileges to your entire cluster.
Let your administrators use the same deployment tooling or mechanism
that they use to manage Kubernetes applications to deploy and manage
gateways.
Give administrators full control over the gateway Deployment, and also
simplify operations. When a new upgrade is available or a configuration
has changed, administrators update gateway Pods by simply restarting them.
This makes the experience of operating a gateway Deployment the same as
operating sidecar proxies for your services.
Deploy gateways
To support users with existing deployment tools, Cloud Service Mesh supports the
same ways to deploy a gateway as
Istio :
IstioOperator , Helm, and Kubernetes YAML. Each method produces the same
result. Although you can choose the method you are most familiar with, we
recommend that you use the Kubernetes YAML method because it is easier to
modify and you can store hydrated manifests in source control.
Create a namespace for the gateway if you don't already have one.
Replace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE with the name of your
namespace.
kubectl create namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
To enable auto-injection, you label your namespaces with the
default injection labels
if the default tag is set up, or with the
revision label to your namespace.
The label that you add also depends on whether you deployed
managed Cloud Service Mesh
or installed the in-cluster control plane. The label is used by the sidecar
injector webhook to associate injected sidecars with a particular control
plane revision.
Select the tab below according to your installation type (either managed or
in-cluster).
Managed
Use the following command to locate the available release channels:
kubectl -n istio-system get controlplanerevision
The output is similar to the following:
NAME AGE
asm-managed 6d7h
asm-managed-rapid 6d7h
In the output, the value under the NAME column is the revision label
that corresponds to the available
release channel
for the Cloud Service Mesh version.
In-cluster
For in-cluster control planes, the istiod Service and Deployment typically
have a revision label similar to istio.io/rev=asm-1285-9 , where
asm-1285-9 identifies the Cloud Service Mesh version. The revision
becomes part of the istiod Service name, for example:
istiod-asm-1285-9.istio-system
Use the following command to locate the revision label on istiod for the
in-cluster control plane:
kubectl get deploy -n istio-system -l app=istiod \
-o=jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.labels.istio\.io\/rev}''{"\n"}'
Enable the namespace for injection. Replace and
REVISION with the value for the revision label.
Note: You can substitute istio.io/rev with the
istio-injection=enabled label if the
default tag
is configured. Verify the default tag exists by running istioctl tag list
with the istioctl from OUTPUT_DIR .
kubectl label namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE istio-injection- istio.io/rev= REVISION --overwrite
If you installed Cloud Service Mesh using asmcli , change to the directory that
you specified in --output_dir , then cd to the samples directory.
Important: To ensure you are in the correct samples directory, run the ls
command to list the directory contents and confirm there is a gateways
directory (which you will access in the next step) and an online-boutique
directory.
If you
didn't install using asmcli , copy the configuration files for the gateways
from the
anthos-service-mesh repository .
You can deploy the example gateway configuration located in the
samples/gateways/ directory as is, or modify it as needed.
Ingress
kubectl apply -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE -f gateways/istio-ingressgateway
Egress
kubectl apply -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE -f gateways/istio-egressgateway
After you create the deployment, verify that the new services are working
correctly:
kubectl get pod,service -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
Verify the output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
pod/istio-ingressgateway-856b7c77-bdb77 1/1 Running 0 3s
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
service/istio-ingressgateway LoadBalancer 10.24.5.129 34.82.157.6 80:31904/TCP 3s
Important: Your gateway resources should be managed like any other Kubernetes
application. The samples in the anthos-service-mesh-packages repository are
meant for guidance and a quickstart and you should customize them according to
your needs.
Gateway selectors
You apply a
Gateway
configuration to the istio-ingressgateway and istio-egressgateway proxies to
manage inbound and outbound traffic for your mesh, letting you specify which
traffic you want to enter or leave the mesh. The labels on a gateway
deployment's Pods are used by Gateway configuration resources, so it's important
that your Gateway selector matches these labels.
For example, in the above deployments, the istio=ingressgateway label is set
on the gateway Pods. To apply a Gateway configuration to these deployments, you
need to select the same label:
apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind : Gateway
metadata :
name : gateway
spec :
selector :
istio : ingressgateway
...
For an example of a Gateway configuration and Virtual Service,
see frontend.yaml
in the Online Boutique sample application.
Upgrade gateways
In-place upgrades
For most use cases, you should upgrade your gateways following the in-place
upgrade pattern. Because gateways utilize Pod injection, new gateway Pods that
are created will automatically be injected with the latest configuration, which
includes the version.
If you would like to change the control plane revision in use by the gateway,
you can set the istio.io/rev label on the gateway Deployment, which will also
trigger a rolling restart.
Managed control plane
Since Google manages the control plane upgrades for the managed control plane,
you can simply restart the gateway Deployment and the new pods will
automatically be injected with the latest configuration and version.
kubectl rollout restart deployment istio-ingressgateway \
-n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
In-cluster control plane
To apply the same pattern to your gateways when you have the in-cluster control
plane, you will need to change the control plane revision in use by the gateway.
Set the istio.io/rev label on the gateway Deployment which will trigger a
rolling restart. The steps required depend on whether you need to update the
revision label on namespace and/or the gateway pod.
If you labeled the namespace for injection, set the istio.io/rev label on
the namespace to the new revision value:
kubectl label namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev= REVISION \
--overwrite
If you enabled injection only for the gateway pod, set the istio.io/rev
label on the Deployment to the new revision value like the following
Kubernetes YAML file:
cat <<EOF > gateway-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: istio-ingressgateway
namespace: GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
istio: ingressgateway
template:
metadata:
annotations:
# This is required to tell Anthos Service Mesh to inject the gateway with the
# required configuration.
inject.istio.io/templates: gateway
labels:
istio: ingressgateway
istio.io/rev: REVISION
spec:
containers:
- name: istio-proxy
image: auto # The image will automatically update each time the pod starts.
EOF
kubectl apply -f gateway-deployment.yaml
Note: If the image does not automatically update with the actual
Cloud Service Mesh proxy image, then the container will not be found and an error
will occur. See Troubleshoot gateways for next
steps.
Canary upgrades (advanced)
If you are using the in-cluster control plane and would like to more slowly
control the rollout of a new control plane revision, you can follow the canary
upgrade pattern. You can run multiple versions of a gateway Deployment and
ensure everything works as expected with a subset of your traffic. For example,
if you want to roll out a new revision, canary, create a copy of your gateway
Deployment with the istio.io/rev= REVISION label set to the
new revision and a new name, for example istio-ingressgateway-canary :
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : istio-ingressgateway-canary
namespace : GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
istio : ingressgateway
template :
metadata :
annotations :
inject.istio.io/templates : gateway
labels :
istio : ingressgateway
istio.io/rev : REVISION # Set to the control plane revision you want to deploy
spec :
containers :
- name : istio-proxy
image : auto
Note: If the image does not automatically update with the actual Cloud Service Mesh
proxy image, then the container will not be found and an error will occur. See
Troubleshoot gateways for next steps.
When this Deployment is created, you will then have two versions of the
gateway, both selected by the same Service:
kubectl get endpoints \
-o "custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,PODS:.subsets[*].addresses[*].targetRef.name" \
-n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
The output is similar to the following:
NAME PODS
istio-ingressgateway istio-ingressgateway-788854c955-8gv96,istio-ingressgateway-canary-b78944cbd-mq2qf
Note: Unlike application services deployed inside the mesh, you cannot use
Istio traffic shifting to distribute the traffic between the gateway versions
because their traffic is coming directly from external clients that Istio does
not control. Instead, you can control the distribution of traffic by the number
of replicas of each Deployment. If you use another load balancer in front of
Istio, you may also use that to control the traffic distribution.
If you are satisfied that your applications are working as expected, run this
command to transition to the new version by deleting the Deployment with the old
istio.io/rev label set:
kubectl delete deploy/istio-ingressgateway -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
If you encountered an issue when testing your application with the new version
of the gateway, run this command to transition back to the old version by
deleting the Deployment with the new istio.io/rev label set:
kubectl delete deploy/istio-ingressgateway-canary -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
Advanced configuration
Configure gateway minimum TLS version
For Cloud Service Mesh version 1.14 and later, the default minimum TLS version for
gateway servers is 1.2. You can configure the minimum TLS version using the
minProtocolVersion field. For more information, see
ServerTLSSettings .
Troubleshoot gateways
Failed to update gateway image from auto
When you deploy or upgrade a gateway, Cloud Service Mesh inserts auto as a
placeholder in the image field. After the call to mutating webhook,
Cloud Service Mesh automatically replaces this placeholder with the actual
Cloud Service Mesh proxy image. If the call to mutating webhook fails, the auto
placeholder remains, and the container will not be found. This is typically
caused by an incorrect namespace label. Ensure you have configured the correct
namespace and then deploy or upgrade the gateway again.
