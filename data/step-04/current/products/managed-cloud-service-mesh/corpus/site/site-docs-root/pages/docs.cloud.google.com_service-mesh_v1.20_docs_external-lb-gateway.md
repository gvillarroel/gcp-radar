Expose an ingress gateway using an external load balancer
Overview
With Cloud Service Mesh you can deploy and manage ingress gateways as part of your
service mesh. You can further configure load balancing for your cluster with
Cloud Service Mesh by using external load balancers (physical or software load
balancers outside of the cluster) to send traffic to the ingress gateway.
This page shows you how to configure an external load balancer with Cloud Service Mesh.
Alternatively, you can
set up ingress with multiple backend configs .
Before you begin
To complete the steps in this document you need the following resources:
A Kubernetes cluster with Cloud Service Mesh installed.
An external load balancer that can access the nodes where your cluster is
running. You will configure this external load balancer to front the ingress
gateway of your cluster via the External IP Address .
Set up your environment
Run the following commands from a workstation that can access the cluster you
intend to use. Make sure that the kubectl tool is configured to use the
cluster context specific to your cluster.
Set the environment variables.
export ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE = asm-ingressgateway
export ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_DEPLOYMENT_NAME = asm-ingressgateway
export ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME = asm-ingressgateway
export ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NODE_LABEL = asm-ingressgateway
Set the IP address of the external load balancer.
export EXTERNAL_LB_IP_ADDRESS = EXTERNAL_LB_IP_ADDRESS
[Optional] Label the ingress gateway nodes. This ensures that the gateway
gets deployed to specific nodes in the cluster.
kubectl label nodes INGRESSGATEWAY_NODE_IP ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NODE_LABEL } =
INGRESSGATEWAY_NODE_IP : is the node(s) in your Kubernetes
cluster that hosts the ingress gateway. Run this kubectl command for as
many ingress nodes you have.
Create the ingress gateway
Create the namespace. This namespace will be used to deploy the ingress
gateway.
kubectl create namespace ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE }
Enable the namespace for injection. The steps depend on your Cloud Service Mesh type (either managed or in-cluster).
Managed
Use the following command to locate the available release channels:
kubectl -n istio-system get controlplanerevision
The output is similar to the following:
NAME AGE
asm-managed 6d7h
asm-managed-rapid 6d7h
In the output, the value under the NAME column is the revision label that corresponds to the available release channel for the Cloud Service Mesh version.
Apply the revision label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE } \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev= REVISION_LABEL --overwrite
In-cluster
Use the following command to locate the revision label on istiod :
kubectl get deploy -n istio-system -l app=istiod -o \
jsonpath={.items[*].metadata.labels.'istio\.io\/rev'}'{"\n"}'
Apply the revision label to the namespace. In the following command,
REVISION is the value of the istiod revision
label that you noted in the previous step.
kubectl label namespace ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE } \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev= REVISION --overwrite
Apply the ingress gateway manifest file .
kubectl --namespace ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE } apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-service-mesh-samples/main/docs/ingress-gateway-external-lb/ingress-gateway.yaml
Expected output:
serviceaccount/asm-ingressgateway created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/asm-ingressgateway created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/asm-ingressgateway created
deployment.apps/asm-ingressgateway created
service/asm-ingressgateway created
poddisruptionbudget.policy/asm-ingressgateway created
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/asm-ingressgateway created
Patch the ingressgateway service with the external load balancer IP address.
cat <<EOF > asm-external-ip-patch.yaml
spec:
externalIPs:
- ${ EXTERNAL_LB_IP_ADDRESS }
loadBalancerIP: ${ EXTERNAL_LB_IP_ADDRESS }
EOF
kubectl --namespace ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE } patch service/ ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME } --patch " $( cat asm-external-ip-patch.yaml ) "
[Optional] Patch the ingressgateway deployment for the ingress gateway
nodes label affinity.
cat <<EOF > asm-ingress-node-label-patch.yaml
spec:
template:
spec:
affinity:
nodeAffinity:
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
nodeSelectorTerms:
- matchExpressions:
- key: ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NODE_LABEL }
operator: Exists
EOF
kubectl --namespace ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE } patch deployment/ ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_DEPLOYMENT_NAME } --patch " $( cat asm-ingress-node-label-patch.yaml ) "
Set up the external load balancer
In this section, you will configure the external load balancer to connect with
the ingress gateway from the cluster.
Fetch ingress gateway Service port information
Get the NodePorts .
export HTTP_INGRESS_PORT = $( kubectl --namespace ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE } get service/ ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME } --output jsonpath = '{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].nodePort}' )
export HTTPS_INGRESS_PORT = $( kubectl --namespace ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE } get service/ ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME } --output jsonpath = '{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="https")].nodePort}' )
export STATUS_PORT = $( kubectl --namespace ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_NAMESPACE } get service/ ${ ASM_INGRESSGATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME } --output jsonpath = '{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="status-port")].nodePort}' )
Display the NodePorts .
echo HTTP_INGRESS_PORT = ${ HTTP_INGRESS_PORT }
echo HTTPS_INGRESS_PORT = ${ HTTPS_INGRESS_PORT }
echo STATUS_PORT = ${ STATUS_PORT }
Configure the external load balancer
Use the NodePorts displayed in the previous step to configure connectivity
between the external load balancer and the ingress gateway.
Configure the health check in your load balancer configuration.
hosts: CLUSTER_NODE_IP
Protocol: HTTP
Port: STATUS_PORT
Path: /healthz/ready
CLUSTER_NODE_IP : is the IP address of the nodes in your
Kubernetes cluster that hosts the ingress gateway. This IP address must be
reachable from your external load balancer. You may have to set up this
configuration multiple times, once per cluster node.
STATUS_PORT : is the NodePort via which the ingress
gateway's health status API is exposed. You can copy this information from
the previous step. It will be the same for every node in the cluster.
Configure node pools in your load balancer for routing HTTP and HTTPS
traffic. Use the following IP:PORT configuration for traffic on port 80
( HTTP ) and port 443 ( HTTPS ).
80 -> CLUSTER_NODE_IP : HTTP_INGRESS_PORT
443 -> CLUSTER_NODE_IP : HTTPS_INGRESS_PORT
CLUSTER_NODE_IP : is the IP address of the nodes in your
Kubernetes cluster that hosts the ingress gateway. This IP address must be
reachable from your external load balancer. You may have to set up this
configuration multiple times, once per cluster node.
HTTP_INGRESS_PORT : is the NodePort via which the
ingress gateway's HTTP traffic is exposed. You can copy this information
from the previous step. It will be the same for every node in the cluster.
HTTPS_INGRESS_PORT : is the NodePort via which the
ingress gateway's HTTPS traffic is exposed. You can copy this information
from the previous step. It will be the same for every node in the cluster.
To verify your set up, ensure that the health checks on your load balancer are
passing.
