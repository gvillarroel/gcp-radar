Troubleshoot managed CNI
This page explains common managed CNI problems with Cloud Service Mesh and
how to resolve them. If you need additional assistance, see
Getting support .
Unsupported managed CNI enabled configuration
Managed Cloud Service Mesh with the TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR control plane
implementation requires managed CNI and does not support disabling it. You may
see the CNI_CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED code in the feature state message if the
mesh.cloud.google.com/managed-cni-enabled label exists but does not have the
value true in the control plane revision (CPR) custom resource (CR) or if the
CNI entry in the asm-options configmap exists but does not have the value on .
To resolve this error message, you must remove any attempts to disable managed
CNI.
Case 1: Remove the managed CNI Enabled label in the CPR CR in the cluster.

CNI Pod unschedulable
You may see this error if the managed CNI Daemonset cannot schedule Pods in any
one of the nodes in the cluster.
Note that in-cluster resources require at least memory: 100Mi on each node.
For more information see
Cloud Service Mesh requirements .
If your cluster already has sufficient memory allocated, see
Pod unschedulable
for additional troubleshooting steps.
