Resolving sidecar proxy/webhook issues in Cloud Service Mesh
This section explains common Cloud Service Mesh problems and how to resolve
them. If you need additional assistance, see
Getting support .
Note: These instructions are only applicable to in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh.
Cloud Service Mesh contains two
webhooks :
The validating webhook ensures applied Istio configuration is valid.
The mutating webhook sets automatic sidecar injection on new pods.
A configuration issue in one of these webhooks might cause new pods to fail
start up, or kubectl apply generating error messages.
Sidecar injection problems
If you have provisioned managed Cloud Service Mesh, then
contact support .
Sidecar injection is not working correctly if you see any of the following:
pods that are scheduling without sidecars
pods that should have sidecars injected never appear when using
kubectl get pods , but the corresponding replica set from
kubectl get replicaset exists.
Use the following steps to troubleshoot sidecar injection problems.
Verify that your namespace or pod has the correct injection label.
If you are running single-revision Istio (the default), verify that your
namespace or pod spec have the istio-injection=enabled label.
If you are running multiple-revision Istio (for zero-downtime migrations,
multiple control planes, etc), verify that your namespace or pod spec have
the appropriate istio.io/rev= REVISION label, where
REVISION is the Cloud Service Mesh revision number on istiod
that corresponds with your selected Cloud Service Mesh version. For more
information about revision labels, see Injecting sidecar proxies .
Verify that your istio sidecar injection webhook is present and has a CA bundle.
The sidecar injector webhook (which is used for automatic sidecar injection)
requires a CA bundle to establish secure connections with the API server and
istiod . This CA bundle is patched into the configuration by istiod , but
can sometimes be overwritten (for example, if you reapply the webhook
configuration).
You can verify the presence of the CA bundle using the following command. The
command includes istio-sidecar-injector-asm-1215-34 , which is
specific to this version of Cloud Service Mesh. Ensure you use your actual
revision if it differs.
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io istio-sidecar-injector-asm-1215-34 -o=jsonpath='{.webhooks[0].clientConfig.caBundle}'
If the output is not empty, the CA bundle is configured. If the CA bundle is
missing, restart istiod to cause it to rescan the webhook and
reinstall the CA bundle.
Check for sidecar injection failures.
If you have injection enabled, but are not seeing pods scheduling, check the
status of the next higher level of abstraction. For example, if you are
running a deployment but no pods are scheduling, check the status of the
corresponding replica sets using the following command:
kubectl -n my-namespace describe replicaset your-deployment-name
If the replica set is present, check the events log at the bottom of the
description for errors. If the error relates to sidecar injection, check the
istiod logs for an indication of what is causing the error.
If the problem persists, the issue might be any of the following:
Bad configuration passed to the injector
Firewall configuration problems
A problem in the Istio code itself
See Troubleshooting Istio
for additional diagnostic steps.
Envoy proxies don't receive configuration from istiod
There are several issues that can prevent proxies from receiving configuration
from istiod .
istiod will not push configuration to the envoy proxies if it has problems,
such as an RBAC issue preventing it from reading its configuration resource.
Discovery address is incorrect ('no healthy upstream' errors)
The discovery address provided to the sidecar injector being incorrect. If
you see logs that mention gRPC config stream closed, no healthy upstream ,
check that the discovery address in the mesh
ProxyConfig
is correct and points to your istiod service.
Invalid configuration being pushed to the proxy. In this case, configuration
is successfully pushed to the proxy, but the configuration is invalid. You will
see repeating messages similar to the following:
Envoy proxy is NOT ready: config not received from Pilot (is Pilot running?): cds updates: 1 successful, 0 rejected; lds updates: 0 successful, 1 rejected
In this example, cds is the Cluster Discovery Service (which reports 1
update pushed from istiod ), and lds is the Listener Discovery Service
(which reports 1 update rejected from istiod ). Often you will see an
earlier error message that explains the reason for the rejection, which
usually starts with a warning about envoy configuration or similar.
To fix the issue, investigate the cause of the rejected configuration. One
common cause is bad EnvoyFilter resources. If no reason is obvious,
submit a bug report with a configuration dump of the proxy.
Pod creation fails
If you observe that pods are not being created successfully, look for error
messages that might give clues to the root problem, using the following command:
kubectl describe replicaset YOUR_REPLICA_SET
Common webhook error messages
Error messages output by the kubectl apply command can provide a hint about
their root cause. See the following table for common error messages, their
causes and potential resolutions.
Error message
Cause
Resolution
net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
This might be a network connectivity issue.
Ensure that your firewall rules provide connectivity to `istiod` on port 15017.
no endpoints available for service 'istiod'
This can occur if the `istiod` pod is not available or not ready.
Check the `istiod` pods to ensure they are running and ready.
Service "istiod" not found
This can occur if the `istiod` service does not exist.
Verify that your Istio installation was successful and correct.
x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
This might be a webhook certificate issue.
Check that caBundle is correctly set on the webhook.
Failed to update validatingwebhookconfiguration
istio-validator-asm-[version-n]-istio-system (failurePolicy=Fail,
resourceVersion=[version]): Operation cannot be fulfilled on
validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io
"istio-validator-asm-[version-n]-istio-system": the object has been
modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try
again.
A validating webhook from an old version of Istio or
Cloud Service Mesh that has been uninstalled may be interfering with an
upgrade or install.
Check that all webhooks still in the cluster and remove any webhook(s)
that reference versions which are no longer installed.
Error from server (InternalError): Internal error occurred: failed
calling webhook "rev.namespace.sidecar-injector.istio.io": Post "https://istiod-asm-1122-0.istio-system.svc:443/inject?timeout=10s": context deadline exceeded
For private clusters, port 15017 must be open. This error message
indicates that port 15017 may not be open.
Ensure that your firewall rules provide connectivity to Istiod on port
15017. For more information, see
Opening a port on a private cluster .
