Resolving workload startup issues in Cloud Service Mesh
This document explains common Cloud Service Mesh problems and how to resolve
them. If you need additional assistance, see
Getting support .
Connection Refused when reaching a Cloud Service Mesh endpoint
You might intermittently experience connection refused ( ECONNREFUSED ) errors
with communication from your clusters to your endpoints, for example
Memorystore Redis, Cloud SQL, or any external service your application
workload needs to reach.
This can occur when your application workload initiates faster than the
istio-proxy ( Envoy ) container and tries to reach an external endpoint. Because
at this stage istio-init ( initContainer ) has already executed, there are
iptables rules in place redirecting all outgoing traffic to Envoy . Since
istio-proxy is not ready yet, the iptables rules will redirect traffic to a
sidecar proxy that is not yet started and therefore, the application gets the
ECONNREFUSED error.
The following steps detail how to check if this is the error you are
experiencing:
Check the stackdriver logs with the following Filter to identify which pods
had the problem.
The following example shows a typical error message:
Error: failed to create connection to feature-store redis, err=dial tcp 192.168.9.16:19209: connect: connection refused
[ioredis] Unhandled error event: Error: connect ECONNREFUSED
Search for an occurrence of the problem. If you are using legacy Stackdriver,
then use resource.type="container" .
resource.type="k8s_container"
textPayload:"$ERROR_MESSAGE$"
Expand the latest occurrence to obtain the name of the pod and then make note
of the pod_name under resource.labels .
Obtain the first occurrence of the issue for that pod:
resource.type="k8s_container"
resource.labels.pod_name="$POD_NAME$"
Example output:
E 2020-03-31T10:41:15.552128897Z
post-feature-service post-feature-service-v1-67d56cdd-g7fvb failed to create
connection to feature-store redis, err=dial tcp 192.168.9.16:19209: connect:
connection refused post-feature-service post-feature-service-v1-67d56cdd-g7fvb
Make note of the timestamp of the first error for this pod.
Use the following filter to see the pod startup events.
resource.type="k8s_container"
resource.labels.pod_name="$POD_NAME$"
Example output:
I 2020-03-31T10:41:15Z spec.containers{istio-proxy} Container image "docker.io/istio/proxyv2:1.3.3" already present on machine spec.containers{istio-proxy}
I 2020-03-31T10:41:15Z spec.containers{istio-proxy} Created container spec.containers{istio-proxy}
I 2020-03-31T10:41:15Z spec.containers{istio-proxy} Started container spec.containers{istio-proxy}
I 2020-03-31T10:41:15Z spec.containers{APP-CONTAINER-NAME} Created container spec.containers{APP-CONTAINER-NAME}
W 2020-03-31T10:41:17Z spec.containers{istio-proxy} Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503 spec.containers{istio-proxy}
W 2020-03-31T10:41:26Z spec.containers{istio-proxy} Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503 spec.containers{istio-proxy}
W 2020-03-31T10:41:28Z spec.containers{istio-proxy} Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503 spec.containers{istio-proxy}
W 2020-03-31T10:41:31Z spec.containers{istio-proxy} Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503 spec.containers{istio-proxy}
W 2020-03-31T10:41:58Z spec.containers{istio-proxy} Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503 spec.containers{istio-proxy}
Use the timestamps of errors and istio-proxy startup events to confirm the
errors are happening when Envoy is not ready.
If the errors occur while the istio-proxy container is not ready yet, it is
normal to obtain connection refused errors. In the preceding example, the pod
was trying to connect to Redis as soon as 2020-03-31T10:41:15.552128897Z
but by 2020-03-31T10:41:58Z istio-proxy was still failing readiness probes.
Even though the istio-proxy container started first, it is possible that it
did not become ready fast enough before the app was already trying to connect
to the external endpoint.
If this is the problem you are experiencing, then continue through the
following troubleshooting steps.
Annotate the config at the pod level. This is only available at the pod
level and not at a global level.
annotations:
proxy.istio.io/config: '{ "holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts": true }'
Modify the application code so that it checks if Envoy is ready before it
tries to make any other requests to external services. For example, on
application start, initiate a loop that makes requests to the istio-proxy
health endpoint and only continues once a 200 is obtained. The istio-proxy
health endpoint is as follows:
http://localhost:15020/healthz/ready
Race condition during sidecar injection between Vault and Cloud Service Mesh
When using vault for secrets management, sometimes vault injects sidecar
before istio , causing that Pods get stuck in Init status. When this happens,
the Pods created get stuck in Init status after restarting any deployment or
deploying a new one. For example:
E 2020-03-31T10:41:15.552128897Z
post-feature-service post-feature-service-v1-67d56cdd-g7fvb failed to create
connection to feature-store redis, err=dial tcp 192.168.9.16:19209: connect:
connection refused post-feature-service post-feature-service-v1-67d56cdd-g7fvb
This issue is caused by a race condition, both Istio and vault inject the
sidecar and Istio must be the last doing this, the istio proxy is not running
during init containers. The istio init container sets up iptables rules to
redirect all traffic to the proxy. Since it is not running yet, those rules
redirect to nothing, blocking all traffic. This is why the init container must
be last, so the proxy is up and running immediately after the iptables rules are
set up. Unfortunately, the order is not deterministic, so if Istio is injected
first it breaks.
To troubleshoot this condition, allow the IP address of vault so the traffic
going to the Vault IP is not redirected to the Envoy Proxy which is not ready
yet and therefore blocking the communication. To achieve this, a new annotation
named excludeOutboundIPRanges should be added.
For managed Cloud Service Mesh, this is only possible at Deployment or Pod
level under spec.template.metadata.annotations , for example:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
...
...
spec:
template:
metadata:
annotations:
traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges:
For in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh, there is an option to set it as a global
one with an IstioOperator under spec.values.global.proxy.excludeIPRanges , for
example:
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
spec:
values:
global:
proxy:
excludeIPRanges: ""
After adding the annotation, restart your workloads.
