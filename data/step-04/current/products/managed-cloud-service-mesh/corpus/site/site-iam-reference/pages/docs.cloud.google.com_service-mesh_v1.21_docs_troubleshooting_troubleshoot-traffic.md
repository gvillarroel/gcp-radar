Resolving traffic management issues in Cloud Service Mesh
This section explains common Cloud Service Mesh problems and how to resolve
them. If you need additional assistance, see
Getting support .
API server connection errors in istiod logs
Istiod cannot contact the apiserver if you see errors similar to the following:
error k8s.io/client-go@v0.18.0/tools/cache/reflector.go:125: Failed to watch *crd.IstioSomeCustomResource`…dial tcp 10.43.240.1:443: connect: connection refused
You can use the regular expression string /error.*cannot list resource/ to
find this error in the logs.
This error is usually transient and if you reached the proxy logs using
kubectl , the issue might be resolved already. This error is usually caused
by events that make the API server temporarily unavailable, such as when an API
server that is not in a high availability configuration reboots for an upgrade
or autoscaling change.
The istio-init container crashes
This problem can occur when the pod iptables rules are not applied to the pod
network namespace. This can be caused by:
An incomplete istio-cni installation
Insufficient workload pod permissions (missing CAP_NET_ADMIN permission)
If you use the Istio CNI plugin, verify that you followed the instructions
completely. Verify that the istio-cni-node container is ready, and check the
logs. If the problem persists, establish a secure shell (SSH) into the host node
and search the node logs for nsenter commands, and see if there are any errors
present.
If you don't use the Istio CNI plugin, verify that the workload pod has
CAP_NET_ADMIN permission, which is automatically set by the sidecar injector.
Connection refused after pod starts
When a Pod starts and gets connection refused trying to connect to an
endpoint, the problem might be that the application container started before
the isto-proxy container. In this case, the application container sends the
request to istio-proxy , but the connection is refused because istio-proxy
isn't listening on the port yet.
In this case, you can:
Modify your application's startup code to make continuous requests to the
istio-proxy health endpoint until the application receives a 200 code. The
istio-proxy health endpoint is:
http://localhost:15020/healthz/ready
Add a retry request mechanism to your application workload.
Listing gateways returns empty
Symptom: When you list Gateways using kubectl get gateway --all-namespaces
after successfully creating a Cloud Service Mesh Gateway, the command returns
No resources found .
This problem can happen on GKE 1.20 and later because the GKE Gateway controller
automatically installs the GKE Gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 resource
in clusters. To workaround the issue:
Check if there are multiple gateway custom resources in the cluster:
kubectl api-resources | grep gateway
Example output:
gateways gw networking.istio.io/v1beta1 true Gateway
gatewayclasses gc networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 false GatewayClass
gateways gtw networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 true Gateway
If the list shows entries other than Gateways with the apiVersion
networking.istio.io/v1beta1 , use the full resource name or the
distinguishable short names in the kubectl command. For example, run
kubectl get gw or kubectl get gateways.networking.istio.io instead of
kubectl get gateway to make sure istio Gateways are listed.
For more information on this issue, see
Kubernetes Gateways and Istio Gateways .
