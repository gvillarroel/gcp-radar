Resolving observability and telemetry issues in Cloud Service Mesh
This section explains common Cloud Service Mesh problems and how to resolve
them. If you need additional assistance, see
Getting support .
In Cloud Service Mesh telemetry, the Envoy proxies call the
Google Cloud Observability APIs periodically to report telemetry data. The type of the
API call determines its frequency:
Logging : every ~10 seconds
Metrics : every ~1 minute
Edges (Context API/Topology view) : incremental reports every ~1 minute,
with full reports every ~10 minutes.
Traces : determined by the sampling frequency you configure (typically, one
out of every 100 requests).
Important: Full telemetry might be delayed 1-2 minutes while clusters start.
The telemetry dashboards gather data from both Confluence and
Google Cloud Observability to display the various service-focused dashboards.
Verify that there is at most one Istio telemetry API configuration
This section only applies to managed Traffic Director control plane.
Note: Cloud Service Mesh with a managed Traffic Director control plane only
supports a cluster-wide telemetry API configuration, specifically, a single
Istio telemetry API CR in the root namespace. Don't deploy multiple Istio
telemetry API CRs in a cluster. If you deploy multiple Istio telemetry API
CRs in a cluster, only the first one takes effect.
If you already have an existing Istio telemetry API CR, to preserve your
previous customization settings in your existing Istio telemetry CR, you
must include them within your new Istio telemetry API CR.
To list the telemetry API configurations, run the following command. Verify that
there is at most one Istio telemetry API configuration.
kubectl -n istio-system get telemetry
Services dashboard is missing a service
The dashboard only displays HTTP(S)/gRPC services. If your service should be in
the list, verify that Cloud Service Mesh telemetry identifies it as an HTTP
service.
If your service remains missing, verify that a
Kubernetes service configuration
exists in your cluster.
Review the list of all Kubernetes services:
kubectl get services --all-namespaces
Review the list of Kubernetes services in a specific namespace:
kubectl get services -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
Missing or incorrect metrics for services
If there are missing or incorrect metrics for services in the Services
dashboard, see the following sections for potential resolutions.
Verify Sidecar proxies exist and have been injected properly
Note: You must have access to the cluster to troubleshoot missing or incorrect
metrics.
The namespace might not have a label for automatic injection, or
manual injection has failed. Confirm that the pods in the namespace have at
least two containers and that one of those containers is the istio-proxy
container:
kubectl -n YOUR_NAMESPACE get pods
Verify that telemetry configuration exists
To confirm that the Google Cloud Observability filter is configured,
gather a configuration dump from each proxy and look for the presence of the
Google Cloud Observability filter:
kubectl debug --image istio/base --target istio-proxy -it YOUR_POD_NAME -n YOUR_NAMESPACE curl localhost:15000/config_dump
In output of the previous command, look for the Google Cloud Observability filter,
which looks like the following:
"config": {
"root_id": "stackdriver_inbound",
"vm_config": {
"vm_id": "stackdriver_inbound",
"runtime": "envoy.wasm.runtime.null",
"code": {
"local": {
"inline_string": "envoy.wasm.null.stackdriver"
}
}
},
"configuration": "{....}"
}
Verify that Cloud Service Mesh identifies an HTTP service
Metrics won't show up in the user interface if the service port for the
Kubernetes service is not named http or any name with an http- prefix.
Confirm that the service has the proper names for its ports.
Verify the Cloud Monitoring API is enabled for the project
Confirm that the Cloud Monitoring API is enabled in the APIs & Services dashboard in
Google Cloud console, which is the default.
Verify no errors reporting to the Cloud Monitoring API
In the Google Cloud console API & Services dashboard, open the
Traffic By Response Code graph URL:
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/monitoring.googleapis.com/metrics?folder=&organizationId=&project= YOUR_PROJECT_ID
If you see error messages, it might be an issue that warrants further
investigation. In particular, look for a large number of 429 error messages,
which indicates a potential quota issue. See the next section for
troubleshooting steps.
Verify correct quota for the Cloud Monitoring API
In the Google Cloud console, open the IAM & Admin menu and verify there is a
Quotas
option. You can access this page directly using the URL:
https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?project= YOUR_PROJECT_ID
This page shows the full set of quotas for the project, where you can search for
Cloud Monitoring API .
Verify no error logs in Envoy proxies
Review the logs for the proxy in question, searching for error message instances:
kubectl -n YOUR_NAMESPACE logs YOUR_POD_NAME -c istio-proxy
However, ignore the warning messages like the following, which are normal:
[warning][filter] [src/envoy/http/authn/http_filter_factory.cc:83]
mTLS PERMISSIVE mode is used, connection can be either plaintext or TLS,
and client cert can be omitted. Please consider to upgrade to mTLS STRICT mode
for more secure configuration that only allows TLS connection with client cert.
See https://istio.io/docs/tasks/security/mtls-migration/ [warning][config]
[bazel-out/k8-opt/bin/external/envoy/source/common/config/_virtual_includes/grpc_stream_lib/common/config/grpc_stream.h:91]
gRPC config stream closed: 13
Verify that metric.mesh_uid is set correctly
Open
Metrics Explorer
and run the following MQL query:
fetch istio_canonical_service
| metric 'istio.io/service/server/request_count'
| align delta ( 1m )
| every 1m
| group_by [ metric.destination_canonical_service_namespace, metric.destination_canonical_service_name, metric.mesh_uid ]
Verify that all expected services are reporting metrics, and that their
metric.mesh_uid is in the format proj-<Cloud Service Mesh fleet project number> .
Note: For multi-project meshes, the project number must be the fleet
project, rather than the host project.
If metric.mesh_uid has any other value, the Cloud Service Mesh dashboard
won't display metrics. metric.mesh_uid is set when Cloud Service Mesh is
installed on the cluster, so investigate your installation method to see if
there's a way to set it to the expected value.
Missing or incorrect telemetry data for services
By default, Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging are enabled in your
Google Cloud project when you install Cloud Service Mesh. To report telemetry data,
each sidecar proxy that is injected into your service pods calls the
Cloud Monitoring API and the Cloud Logging API. After deploying workloads, it takes
about one or two minutes for telemetry data to be displayed in the
Google Cloud console. Cloud Service Mesh automatically keeps the service dashboards
up to date:
For metrics, the sidecar proxies call the Cloud Monitoring API approximately
every minute.
To update the Topology graph, the sidecar proxies send incremental reports
approximately every minute and full reports about every ten minutes.
For logging, the sidecar proxies call the Cloud Logging API approximately every
ten seconds.
For tracing, you have to enable Cloud Trace. Traces are reported
according to the sampling frequency that you have configured (typically, one
out of every 100 requests).
Metrics are displayed only for HTTP services on the Cloud Service Mesh
Metrics page. If you don't see any metrics, verify that all the pods in the
namespace for your application's services have sidecar proxies injected:
kubectl get pod -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --all
In the output, notice that the READY column shows two containers for each of
your workloads: the primary container and the container for the sidecar proxy.
Additionally, the Services dashboard only displays server metrics, so telemetry
data may not appear if the client is not in the mesh or if it is configured to
report only client metrics (such as ingress gateways).
