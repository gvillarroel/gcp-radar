Preview
Note: This document and the software it is documenting are part of a
preview release. Apigee does not warranty the software or the procedures in
this preview. The documentation and software are subject to change without notice.
This document is intended for the Apigee operator persona (users who
install/manage/administer Apigee hybrid installations). Experience in
installing Apigee hybrid on one of the supported Kubernetes platforms is a
prerequisite for following the instructions in this document. It is
recommended you create an evaluation Apigee org to try the steps below.
Feedback
Please send feedback on this process to Apigee-hybrid-install-preview@google.com .
Overview
The new Apigee hybrid installation experience installs Apigee components using kubectl and integrates installation and management of Apigee Hybrid with Kubernetes configuration orchestration tools like Kustomize . The enhanced validations and visibility of the components being installed provides better debuggability and improves the overall install process.
An install script, apigee-hybrid-setup.sh , provides an easy tool for basic installation. You can use that to create your hybrid installation and then modify it to fit your needs with kubectl , or you can create your hybrid installation from scratch using kubectl .
All Apigee hybrid configuration properties are stored in yaml files, one for each major component. This allows much more granular control of your hybrid installation on your Kubernetes environment. You can find the configuration files and installation scripts in the repository in GitHub .
Changes in the new installation process
Apigee is changing the process of installing Apigee hybrid for the following reasons:
The new method of installing Apigee hybrid can be integrated with existing
Kubernetes CI/CD tools like Argo, Flux or Anthos Config Management which do not
use an
overrides.yaml
configuration file.
Apigee hybrid has provided
apigeectl ,
a custom templating tool that generates Kubernetes manifests (amongst other
things) to install and manage Apigee hybrid in Kubernetes clusters. The new
installation and management process provides an experience similar to that from
other software vendors.
The new process enables basic installation quickly by automatically creating
service accounts with the requisite permissions, TLS certificates,
pre-populating defaults and other necessary foundational elements.
Prerequisites
Before using this preview installation, you must meet the following prerequisites:
Preview version
This preview is intended to work with
Apigee hybrid version 1.8.x .
Later versions of Apigee hybrid are not supported.
Apigee hybrid setup
Before proceeding with the actual installation of Apigee Hybrid, you are expected to have completed the following instructions listed in the following sections of the documentation:
Project and Org setup

Common variables used in this guide
This guide uses the following environment variables in several steps. You can define them at the command line or with a script, or you can replace the text in the commands when you enter them.
APIGEE_NAMESPACE : Your Apigee namespace. By default this is apigee .
However, you can use a different namespace.
CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the cluster where you are installing Apigee hybrid.
This is the cluster you create in
Step 1: Create a Cluster
CLUSTER_LOCATION : The region of your cluster. The procedures in this guide
assume you are using a regional cluster. If you are using a zonal cluster,
see the instructions in
Step 1: Create a Cluster
ENV_GROUP : The name of the environment group for your Apigee hybrid
installation. This is the environment group you create in
Step 3: Create an environment group .
You can create multiple environment groups.
ENV_NAME : The name of the environment group for your Apigee hybrid
installation. This is the environment group you create in Step 3: Create an
environment group .
You can create multiple environment groups.
INSTALL_DIR : The directory where you install Apigee hybrid. By default,
this is the apigee-hybrid-install/ subdirectory of the directory where
you download the installer, for example: /myhybrid/apigee-hybrid-install/ .
This is the root directory for the file structure documented in Apigee
Hybrid Setup Folder Structure .
INSTANCE_DIR : The directory for a specific Apigee hybrid instance. By
default, the first instance is named instance-1 . The instance dir is
a subdirectory of ${INSTALL_DIR}/overlays/instances/ . You can specify any
name for your hybrid instances. See Multi Instance
Installation .
ORG_NAME : The name of your Apigee hybrid organization. This must
be the same as your Google Cloud project ID. See: Step 2: Create an
organization .
Basic Apigee hybrid installation
To quickly install Apigee Hybrid without heavy customization, you can use the following two-step procedure.
Note: A basic installation has the following configuration:
A single environment
A single environment group
A single Google Cloud service account is created and used for all the individual components
Default values for all encryption keys and passwords.
Download setup files
Run setup
Download setup files
Download and prepare the setup files by cloning the GitHub repository at https://github.com/apigee/apigee-hybrid-install/releases/tag/preview-1 :
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/apigee/apigee-hybrid-install.git
Navigate to the directory for the cloned repository:
cd apigee-hybrid-install
Create a branch from the preview-1 tag:
git branch preview-1 preview-1
git checkout preview-1
Make the setup script executable:
chmod + x ./ tools / apigee - hybrid - setup . sh
The cloned repository will have a structure resembling the one described in Apigee Hybrid Setup Folder Structure :
Run setup
Run the apigee-hybrid-setup.sh shell script located inside the tools/ folder.
./ tools / apigee - hybrid - setup . sh -- cluster - name $ CLUSTER_NAME -- cluster - region $ CLUSTER_LOCATION -- org $ ORG_NAME -- setup - all
Note: Running the script with these arguments uses the Apigee Organization, Environment, and Environment group you created in Prerequisites .
If you encounter errors try running the script a second time.
Additional options you may want to use are:
--env $ENV_NAME specifies the name of the Apigee environment.
--envgroup $ENV_GROUP specifies the environment group.
--ingress-domain $HOSTNAME specifies the hostname you supplied for your environment group.
--gcp-project-id $PROJECT_ID specifies the id of your Google Cloud project.
For more options, refer to Understanding the script .
Any errors during the execution will be printed to standard output.
Once the script completes successfully, you will have completed the basic hybrid installation. You can test your installation by creating a sample proxy as detailed in Create and deploy a new API proxy .
Customized Apigee Hybrid installation
For more advanced users who would like fine grained control over the installation, you can follow the these sequence of steps (for many of the steps given below, you can choose to either perform the step manually, or use the shell script to automate that individual step):
Note: These steps require a basic understanding of kubernetes concepts. Refer to the Concepts section or Kubernetes Documentation for more details.
Download setup files
Download and prepare the setup files:
Clone the GitHub repository at https://github.com/apigee/apigee-hybrid-install/
The cloned repository will have a structure resembling the one described in Apigee Hybrid Setup Folder Structure :
cd into the apigee-hybrid-install/ directory
Make the setup script executable:
chmod + x ./ tools / apigee - hybrid - setup . sh
Create namespace
Create a kubernetes namespace in your cluster which will contain all the Apigee cluster components.
kubectl create namespace apigee
Note: Apigee is the default name for the namespace. You can use a different name.
If you choose another name for the namespace, then you can choose to follow one of the three options below:
(Recommended) Use --namespace={YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME} while prefilling values in Edit resource yamls .
Run the two following commands:
Use kpt to specify the Apigee namespace:
kpt fn eval " ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/" \
--image gcr.io/kpt-fn/apply-setters:v0.2.0 -- \
APIGEE_NAMESPACE=" ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } "
# This is for replacing the namespace in istio discoveryAddress which cannot be
# achieved with kpt
Use sed to replace the namespace in istio discoveryAddress:
sed -i -E -e "s/(discoveryAddress: apigee-ingressgateway-manager\.).*(\.svc:15012)/\1 ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } \2/" " ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/controllers/istiod/apigee-istio-mesh-config.yaml"
As an alternative, you can manually change the resources individually to be created in the namespace of your choice.
Using docker images from private repositories (optional)
You can choose to not use the publicly hosted images, and can use images from your own private repositories:
The first step is to push all the images to your private repo, which can be done by following the steps in apigee-pull-push | Apigee X . By default, images are tagged with the Apigee Hybrid version which they correspond to, and it is recommended that you do not edit these tags. We also recommend that you not edit the image names either so that the final image path can be constructed as explained in Image Hub .
Set the value of imageHub field present inside file apigee-hybrid-config.yaml to the private repo host path. (Refer to Image Hub for details).
imageHub: "your.private.repo/apigee/hybrid"
This will ensure that all the Apigee hybrid components use the images from your private repo.
In addition to this, you may also want to use a private image for the controller and Apigee ingress gateway, for which, you will have to edit the apigee-controller-deployment.yaml and apigee-ingressgateway-manager-deployment.yaml files and replace all the image fields with the image from their private repo.
Note: If you are pulling images from a private repository, then most likely you'll need to authenticate in order to pull those images. The credentials required for this authentication are specified as imagePullSecrets , which has been discussed in detail in Configuring imagePullSecrets (optional) .
Configuring imagePullSecrets (optional)
Create a kubernetes secret containing the credentials to authenticate with the private repositories. Refer Pull an Image from a Private Registry to understand how the secret has to be created.
Once the secret is created, all that's left is to refer to that secret, which can be done by editing the file apigee-hybrid-config.yaml and setting the value of the imagePullSecret field to the name of the secret created previously, and enable the imagePullSecret component in the corresponding kustomization.yaml file.
Note: If you are using private images for the controller as well, then you may also need to add imagePullSecret s fields in the deployment spec present in the apigee-controller-deployment.yaml and apigee-ingressgateway-manager-deployment.yaml files.
If in case you do specify the imagePullSecrets in both the places, the one present inside apigee-controller-manager.yaml file will take precedence.
Configuring forward proxy (optional)
Forward proxies can be configured by adding the forwardProxy field to the apigee-hybrid-config.yaml file. For example:
forwardProxy: |
scheme: HTTP
host: 10.12.0.47
port: 3128
Specifying ingress TLS certificates
Using the script
./ tools / apigee - hybrid - setup . sh -- create - ingress - tls - certs
Refer - Understanding the script for more details about this flag.
Manual
You are expected to provide TLS certificates which will be used for istio ingress gateway. You can:
either use certificates signed by a known authority using the steps mentioned in Obtain TLS certificates: An example | Apigee X
or generate self signed certificates.
Here we'll use self signed certificates as an example. Self signed certificates can be generated using (assuming DOMAIN has been properly set and should match the hostname set in your envgroup):
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout ./tls.key -out ./tls.crt -subj '/CN='$DOMAIN'' -days 3650
This will create two files named tls.key and tls.crt .
You then need to create a secret having the following format You can use kubectl create or kubectl apply as explained in Using custom certificate/key pair for certificate signing authority (optional):
apiVersion : v1
kind : Secret
metadata :
name : "{ORG_NAME}-{ENV_GROUP_NAME}"
namespace : { $ APIGEE_NAMESPACE }
type : Opaque
data :
cert : |
{ BASE64_ENCODED_TLS_CRT }
key : |
{ BASE64_ENCODED_TLS_KEY }
---
Example of creating the secret using kubectl create :
kubectl create secret tls {ORG_NAME}-{ENV_GROUP_NAME} \
--cert="tls.crt" \
--key="tls.key" \
-n {$APIGEE_NAMESPACE}
Note: If you change the name of the secret above, you'll need to make a corresponding change in apigee-route-config.yaml by changing the value of secretNameRef to YOUR_SECRET_NAME
Update ingress deployment
To create/modify ingress deployments - you need to modify the spec.components.ingressGateways field in the ApigeeOrganization Custom Resource in bases/initialization/crds/customresourcedefinition-apigeeorganizations.apigee.cloud.google.com.yaml .
By default, we create one ingress deployment with default parameters(default values will be shown in the CR reference docs ):
ingressGateways:
- name: "prod-1"
Examples:
A. Overriding ingress service fields
ingressGateways :
- name : "prod-1"
serviceSpec :
annotations :
{ KEY }: $ { VALUE }
loadBalancerIP : $ { IP }
B. Change replica Min/Max
ingressGateways:
- name: "prod-1"
​​autoScaler:
minReplicas: 4
maxReplicas: 10
C. Adding new Ingress Deployment
ingressGateways:
- name: "prod-1"
- name: "prod-2"
Configuring custom Google Cloud service accounts
Note: One of Configuring custom Google Cloud service accounts or Using workload
identities is mandatory)
Using the script
./ tools / apigee - hybrid - setup . sh -- create - gcp - sa - and - secrets -- namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE
Where APIGEE_NAMESPACE is your custom namespace. The default namespace is apigee .
Refer to Understanding the script for more details about the flags.
Manual
Google Cloud service account keys need to be stored as secrets in the cluster. The secret yaml should have the following structure:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Secret
metadata :
name : "{NAME}"
namespace : { APIGEE_NAMESPACE }
type : Opaque
data :
client_secret . json : |
{ BASE64_ENCODED_SA_KEY }
For more details about what all service accounts are required and the names of the secrets, refer to the Google Cloud service accounts section.
You are free to choose a different name for the secrets but then you'll have to make a corresponding change in the component where that secret name was used. For example, if you decide to change the name of the runtime service account secret from apigee-runtime-svc-account-${ORG_NAME}-${ENV_NAME} to my-runtime-svc , you will have to make a corresponding change in the apigee-environment.yaml for that environment
Note: The secrets which contain the service account keys can be sourced from external secret management tools like Vault. Refer Storing service account keys in external vaults section for details on how to do that.
Using workload identities
Note: Workload identities can only be used with GKE clusters in Google Cloud.
One of Configuring custom Google Cloud service accounts or Using workload identities is mandatory.
Prerequisites
Before using workload identities, make sure that your GKE cluster has the support enabled. Refer Updating Node Pools | Apigee X for details.
Enabling workload-identity
Refer Workload identities section under Kustomize and Components for details on how you can enable workload identities before installation.
Edit resource yamls
Some places in the component yamls require the correct organization, environment and environment group names to be present. You can set these values either manually, or use the shell script to automatically fill these values.
Using the script
./ tools / apigee - hybrid - setup . sh -- fill - values
Create initialization resources and controller
#Additional steps for openshift
kubectl apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/openshift
//apigee datastore
kubectl apply -f ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /datastore/components/openshift-scc/scc.yaml
//telemetry
kubectl apply -f ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /telemetry/components/openshift-scc/scc.yaml
#Create Apigee initialization kubernetes resources
kubectl apply -f ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/certificates
kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/crds
kubectl apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/webhooks
kubectl apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/rbac
kubectl apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/ingress
# Create controller config and controller
kubectl apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/controllers
# Wait for the controllers to be available
kubectl wait deployment/apigee-controller-manager deployment/apigee-ingressgateway-manager -n " ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } " --for=condition=available --timeout=2m
# Create the datastore and redis secrets first and then the rest of the secrets.
kubectl apply -f ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /datastore/secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -f ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /redis/secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -f ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /environments/ ${ ENV_NAME } /secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -f ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /organization/secrets.yaml
Give permissions to Synchronizer service account to interact with Control Plane
Follow the steps in Step 8: Enable Synchronizer access ,
replacing name of the service account, either apigee-non-prod or apigee-synchronizer , with
apigee-all-sa , the name of the service account created by the new install process.
★ Important: Make sure to change the service account name in the instructions under
Enable synchronizer access .
Otherwise enabling access for synchronizer will fail.
Create Apigee data plane components
If you had changed the names of any of the resources in the previous steps, you'll need to make a corresponding change in other YAML files where that resource was referenced. Once that's done, use the commands in the following example:
# Create the rest of the resources.
kubectl apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR }
to install all the components.
Wait for resources to start
kubectl wait "apigeedatastore/default" \
"apigeeredis/default" \
"apigeeenvironment/ ${ ORG_NAME } - ${ ENV_NAME } " \
"apigeeorganization/ ${ ORG_NAME } " \
"apigeetelemetry/apigee-telemetry" \
-n " ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } " --for="jsonpath=.status.state=running" --timeout=15m
Customize installation for cert-manager in a custom namespace
Customize the namespace where cert-manager is running with the following procedure.
If cert-manager is installed in your cluster in a namespace other than cert-manager
you will need to update the namespace used to create the Apigee root certificate.
Edit the customization.yaml file for the certificate creation: $INSTALL_DIR/overlays/initialization/certificates/kustomize.yaml
Add the following to the end of the file.
- patch: |-
- op: replace
path: /metadata/namespace
value: "gk-cert-manager"
target:
group: cert-manager.io
version: v1
kind: Certificate
name: apigee-root-certificate
Save the file
Kustomize and Components
Overview
The new Hybrid Installation inherits the Kustomize ideology of structuring yamls in the form of Bases and Overlays
Bases are files supplied by Apigee, which might change between each new Hybrid release. You are not expected to modify these files. These files hold some default values that are supplied by Apigee. All files under the top level bases/ folder contain these Bases
Overlays hold user configuration and serve as the means through which you can modify default values specified in the Bases. All files under the top level overlays/ folder contain these Overlays
Note: For a better understanding of Kustomize and how overlays have been used to modify bases, it is strongly recommended that you go through Kustomize Patches .
How to use Components
The subfolders within the top level overlays/ directory have been structured in such a way that you can enable (or disable) a certain additional feature by commenting (or uncommenting) certain lines in the kustomization.yaml files.
For example, this is what the overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/telemetry folder structure looks like:
telemetry
├── components
│ ├── http - proxy
│ ├── imagepullsecret
│ ├── logger
│ ├── metrics
│ ├── nodeselector
│ ├── openshift - scc
│ ├── workload - identity - logger
│ └── workload - identity - metrics
├── apigee - telemetry . yaml
└── kustomization . yaml
Here's how the telemetry/kustomization.yaml files would probably look like by default:
resources :
- apigee - telemetry . yaml
components :
- ./ components / metrics
# - ./components/workload-identity-metrics
# - ./components/logger
# - ./components/workload-identity-logger
# - ./components/http-proxy
# - ./components/nodeselector/
# - ./components/imagepullsecret
# - ./components/openshift-scc
We can see that the ./components/logger has been commented out, which simply means that we've not enabled uGoogle Clod logger by default. In order to enable that, you can simply uncomment that line like so:
components:
- ./components/logger
Similarly, to disable metrics, you can comment out the ./components/metrics line:
...
components:
...
# - ./components/metrics
…
The following sections will talk about all such various components, when they can be used, and how they can be configured.
OpenShift
For users who wish to install Apigee Hybrid in an OpenShift cluster, you might need to enable a few components/resources before performing the install . (This is required if you don't use the script to perform the installation). The files which need to be modified are:
overlays/initialization/openshift/kustomization.yaml .
Under resources: section, uncomment:
# - ../../../bases/initialization/openshift/
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/datastore/kustomization.yaml
Uncomment:
# - ./components/openshift-scc
and uncomment the " components: " field if it is still commented out.
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/telemetry/kustomization.yaml
Uncomment:
# - ./components/openshift-scc
and uncomment the " components: " field if it is still commented out.
You can then proceed with the installation steps.
imagepullsecret
This component can be enabled when you have images stored in your private repository. To pull images from a private repository, you can create a kubernetes secret which will have your authentication details and can then reference this secret inside. See Configuring imagePullSecrets (optional) for instructions. Refer to Pull an Image from a Private Registry | Kubernetes in the Kubernetes documentation for more information.
Available in:
overlays/controllers/apigee-controller
overlays/controllers/istiod
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/datastore
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/environments/{ENV_NAME}
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/organization
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/redis
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/telemetry
Enabling:
Uncomment the " ./components/imagepullsecret/ " line in the respective kustomization.yaml files wherever required.
Modifications to be made:
components/imagepullsecret/patch.yaml
REQUIRED Add relevant secret names to the list in spec.template.spec.imagePullSecrets
Usage:
If you have not yet installed Apigee Hybrid, you can continue with the installation steps and these changes will get applied in the process
If you already have Apigee Hybrid installed, you will need to apply these new changes using:
kubectl apply -k overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}
nodeselector
This component allows you to schedule pods for an Apigee resource on specific nodes. Refer to Assigning Pods to Nodes | Kubernetes for additional information.
Available in:
overlays/controllers/apigee-controller
overlays/controllers/istiod
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/datastore
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/environments/{ENV_NAME}
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/organization
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/redis
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/telemetry
Enabling:
Uncomment the " ./components/nodeselector " line in the respective kustomization.yaml files wherever required.
Modifications to be made:
components/nodeselector/patch.yaml
OPTIONAL Change the value of the node selector label from apigee-runtime or apigee-data to the desired one.
Usage:
If you have not yet installed Apigee Hybrid, you can continue with the installation steps and these changes will get applied in the process
If you already have Apigee Hybrid installed, you will need to apply these new changes using:
kubectl apply -k overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}
workload-identity
Various containers in the Apigee Hybrid ecosystem require permissions to make certain API calls to the Apigee Control Plane / Management Plane. Workload identity is one of granting the pods (and the containers within) these permissions. Useful resources to read more about this include:
- Introducing Workload Identity: Better authentication for your GKE applications | Google Cloud Blog
- Use Workload Identity | Kubernetes Engine Documentation | Google Cloud
Available in:
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/datastore
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/environments/{ENV_NAME}
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/organization
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/redis
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/telemetry
Prerequisite:
Before you are able to make use of workload identity, you'll need to grant the relevant permissions within you Google Cloud project using:
gcloud iam service - accounts add - iam - policy - binding \
-- role roles / iam . workloadIdentityUser \
-- member "serviceAccount:${ORG_NAME}.svc.id.goog[${APIGEE_NAMESPACE}/${KSA_NAME}]" \
$ { GSA_NAME } @ $ { ORG_NAME } . iam.gserviceaccount.com
where:
- ${ORG_NAME} - The name of your Apigee Organization.
- ${APIGEE_NAMESPACE} - The kubernetes namespace where Apigee components have been installed. This would usually be apigee unless explicitly changed by the user during the installation
- ${KSA_NAME} - The name of the kubernetes namespace. You will need to run this command for each kubernetes service account mentioned in Kubernetes service accounts
- ${GSA_NAME} - The name of the Google Cloud service account. If you have not made any changes during installation, this will have the value apigee-all-sa . If you set up multiple Google Cloud service accounts for individual components, you'll need to match the KSA_NAME with the corresponding GSA_NAME. You can compare the tables in Google Cloud service accounts with Kubernetes service accounts to find the equivalents.
Enabling:
Uncomment the ./components/workload-identity line in the respective kustomization.yaml files wherever required. Note that within telemetry, we have separate workload identity addons for metrics and logger components which can be enabled individually.
Usage:
If you have not yet installed hybrid, you can simply enable the workload-identity as mentioned in the previous section and continue with the installation which will then automatically use workload-identity.
If you already have Apigee Hybrid installed, you will need to apply these new changes using:
kubectl apply -k overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}
http-proxy
You can configure a proxy server in each of the following components so that traffic for that component goes through the http proxy configured for that component. You can configure the proxy for each Apigee component individually.
Available in:
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/datastore
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/environments/{ENV_NAME}
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/organization
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/telemetry
Enabling:
Uncomment the " ./components/http-proxy/ " line in the respective kustomization.yaml files wherever required.
Modifications to be made:
components/http-proxy/patch.yaml
Following parameters can be configured under the spec.httpForwardProxy
scheme : REQUIRED One of HTTP or HTTPS
host : REQUIRED The Host address of your proxy
port : REQUIRED The port number
username : OPTIONAL The username associated with your proxy
password : OPTIONAL The password for accessing the proxy
Usage:
If you have not yet installed Apigee Hybrid, you can continue with the installation steps and these changes will get applied in the process
If you already have Apigee Hybrid installed, you will need to apply these new changes using:
kubectl apply -k overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}
logger and metrics
You can individually enable or disable logger or metrics within overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/telemetry. By default, logger is disabled and metrics are enabled. Enabling or disabling them is simply uncommenting or commenting their lines in the telemetry/kustomization.yaml
gcs-backup and gcs-restore
This kustomize component can be used to perform a backup and restore for the cassandra database to Google Cloud Storage.
Available in:
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/datastore
Prerequisite:
Download the Google Cloud service accounts keys for an account which has the Storage Object Admin role.
If you used the script to perform the installation and did not use workload-identities you can reuse the downloaded keys available under the service-accounts folder which gets created by the script.
You could also use the create-service-account.sh script to create a new service account and download its keys:
./ tools / create - service - accounts =. sh -- env prod -- profile apigee ‑ cassandra
Once the keys have been downloaded, you need to create a kubernetes secret with the name apigee-cassandra-backup-and-restore-gcp-sa-key which can be done using the command:
kubectl create secret generic "apigee-cassandra-backup-and-restore-gcp-sa-key" \
--from-file="dbbackup_key.json= ${ PATH_TO_SA_KEY } " \
-n " ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } "
Where:
${PATH_TO_SA_KEY} - Path to the file containing the service account keys.
${APIGEE_NAMESPACE} - The kubernetes namespace where Apigee
components have been installed. This would usually be apigee unless, explicitly changed during the installation
Alternatively, you can use the template file templates/secret-apigee-cassandra-backup-and-restore-gcp-sa-key.yaml to create this secret.
Enabling:
If you want to enable backup, uncomment the "./components/gcs-backup" line in the datastore kustomization.yaml file.
If you want to restore a backup, uncomment the "./components/gcs-restore" line in the datastore kustomization.yaml file.

Performing the restore:
For background information about restoring backups, see
Restoring backups | Apigee X | Google Cloud
Create a new Kubernetes cluster with a new namespace in which to restore the hybrid runtime deployment. You cannot use the same cluster and namespace that you used for the original hybrid installation.
Install Hybrid into the new cluster with the above configured settings in addition to any other settings that you desire:
You can either use the Basic install and install hybrid in the new namespace:
./ tools / apigee - hybrid - setup . sh \
-- cluster - name $ CLUSTER_NAME \
-- cluster - region $ CLUSTER_LOCATION \
-- namespace $ { NEW_APIGEE_NAMESPACE }
Or follow the Customized Apigee Hybrid installation to configure things as per your choice.
Once the restoration is complete, all resources in the old namespace could be deleted and switched over to the new namespace.
For more information, see Restoring backups .
non-gcs-backup and non-gcs-restore
This kustomize component can be used to perform a backup and restore for the cassandra database to Google Cloud Storage.
Available in:
overlays/instances/{INSTANCE_NAME}/datastore
Prerequisite:
Steps from the already existing documentation for Set up the server and SSH can be utilized.
From the above steps, you'll need to use the SSH private key which is available in the file "ssh_key" generated by following the previous steps. We'll then create a kubernetes secret by the name apigee-cassandra-backup-and-restore-gcp-sa-key which contains this SSH Private key.
Note: Ensure that your SSH private key file has a new line at the end.
The kubernetes secret can be created using the following command:
kubectl create secret generic "apigee-cassandra-backup-and-restore-key-file" \
--from-file="key= ${ PATH_TO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY } " \
-n " ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } "
Where:
${PATH_TO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY} - Path to the file containing the SSH private key
${APIGEE_NAMESPACE} - The kubernetes namespace where Apigee components have been installed. This would usually be apigee unless, explicitly changed during the installation
Alternatively, you can use the template file templates/secret-apigee-cassandra-backup-and-restore-key-file.yaml to create this secret.

multi-region
This component can be used while configuring a multi-region cassandra deployment.
For more information, see Multi-region deployment on GKE and GKE on-prem
Enabling:
Uncomment the " ./components/multi-region " line in the datastore/kustomization.yaml file
Modifications to be made:
components/multi-region/cassandra-data-replication.yaml
REQUIRED source.region The source Cassandra datacenter name that will be used to replicate data from. Can be identified by using the following command in the source cluster:
kubectl get apigeedatastore -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } -o=jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.components.cassandra.properties.datacenter}'
components/multi-region/patch.yaml
REQUIRED spec.components.properties.multiRegionSeedHost The Pod IP of any of the source cassandra pods. We can use:
kubectl get pods -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } -o wide
To list all the pods and get the IP of any cassandra pod, use the following command:
kubectl get pods -o wide -n apigee
Your output should look something like the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE
apigee-cassandra-default-0 1/1 Running 0 5d 10.0.0.11 gke-k8s-dc-2-default-pool-a2206492-p55d

apigee-cassandra-default-2 1/1 Running 0 5d 10.0.3.5 gke-k8s-dc-2-default-pool-e589awq3-kjch
For more information, see Prerequisites for GKE in "Multi-region deployment on GKE, GKE on-prem, and AKS" :
Usage:
The use of this component mostly makes sense when you are setting up Apigee Hybrid in a new cluster and you already have another working setup of Apigee Hybrid.
Both the new and the existing cluster need to be using the same TLS certificates to ensure proper communication between the Cassandra pods. So we'll need to copy the apigee-root-certificate secret from the existing cluster and use it in the newer one as well:
Run:
kubectl config get-contexts
To get a list of all the kubernetes contexts and then run
kubectl config use-context SOURCE_CLUSTER_CONTEXT
where SOURCE_CLUSTER_CONTEXT is the name of the source kubernetes cluster context.
Store the root certificate secret in a file:
kubectl get secret/apigee-root-certificate -n cert-manager -o yaml > apigee-root-certificate.yaml
Switch the cluster context to the new cluster where you are installing Apigee Hybrid.
kubectl config use-context ${ NEW_CLUSTER_CONTEXT }
Create the root secret in the new cluster:
kubectl -n cert-manager apply -f apigee-root-certificate.yaml
Disable the creation of a new root certificate. This will ensure that we don't create a new apigee-root-certificate and end up overwriting the one that we created in the previous step.
Uncomment the following lines in the overlays/initialization/certificates/kustomization.yaml file:
# components:
# - ./components/disable-apigee-root-certificate-generation
Continue with the rest of the Apigee Hybrid installation either using the
Basic Apigee Hybrid Installation
or the Customized Apigee Hybrid installation .
For example, following the
Basic Apigee Hybrid Installation , you can execute:
./ tools / apigee - hybrid - setup . sh -- cluster - name $ CLUSTER_NAME -- cluster - region $ CLUSTER_LOCATION
Verify the rebuild status using the following command.
Note: The rebuild operation can take up to several hours depending on the data size.
kubectl -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } get apigeeds -o json | jq ".items[].status.cassandraDataReplication"
Verify the rebuild processes from the logs. Also, verify the data size using the nodetool status command:
kubectl logs apigee - cassandra - default - 0 - f - n $ { APIGEE_NAMESPACE }
kubectl exec apigee - cassandra - default - 0 - n $ { APIGEE_NAMESPACE } -- nodetool - u $ { JMX_USER } - pw $ { JMX_PASSWORD } status
Verify the rebuild status using the following command.
Note: The rebuild operation can take up to several hours depending on the data size.
kubectl -n apigee get apigeeds -o json | jq ".items[].status.cassandraDataReplication"
The results should look something like:
{
"rebuildDetails": {
"apigee-cassandra-default-0": {
"state": "complete",
"updated": 1623105760
},
"apigee-cassandra-default-1": {

Concepts
Image Hub
Docker container images are generally specified in the format:
${ REGISTRY_HOST_PATH } / ${ IMAGE_NAME } : ${ IMAGE_TAG }
or ones that use a digest look like:
${ REGISTRY_HOST_PATH } / ${ IMAGE_NAME } @ ${ DIGEST }
Apigee uses the concept of "Image Hub", which in the above formats refers to the ${REGISTRY_HOST_PATH} . The default value of the Image Hub is gcr.io/apigee-release/hybrid/ .
(Images which utilize DIGEST will need to be individually set in each subcomponent)
Apigee constructs the final image path by combining the value of following:
"Image Hub" which can be overridden in apigee-hybrid-config.yaml (refer to Using docker images from private repositories section for detailed steps on how to override Image Hub).
The value of the IMAGE_TAG is obtained from the version field, which is present inside the yaml file for each of the individual components (for example, apigee-organization.yaml ). Apigee tags the images with the Apigee Hybrid version - meaning IMAGE_TAG is 1.8 for Apigee Hybrid version 1.8
IMAGE_NAME is implicitly determined from the name of the container where the image will be used. For example, for the apigee-runtime container, the IMAGE_NAME will be apigee-runtime.
Thus, a complete example of an image path would be gcr.io/apigee-release/hybrid/apigee-runtime:1.8.0
In this way, the final image path is constructed, which would then be used inside each of the containers in their respective pods.
Google Cloud service accounts
Google Cloud service accounts are accounts used by applications to make authorized calls to Google APIs. Google Cloud service account keys can be downloaded which can then be used for authentication purposes. Apigee expects the user to provide service account keys by creating secrets. The following are the names of the components and the default name of the secret where it looks for service account keys:
Component

Default kubernetes secret name containing service account key
organization

telemetry
metrics
apigee-metrics-gcp-sa-key
containerLogs
apigee-logger-gcp-sa-key
Kubernetes service accounts
Kubernetes service accounts provide identities to pods in your cluster. By default, Apigee controller creates these for you. But, if you'd like to override the creation (for example, when you are using Workload identities ), then you can do so by specifying the podServiceAccountName field in the various sub components.
List of components and their respective sub components where the kubernetes service account can be specified along with the default name of the k8s service account when you enable the workload identity patch for them.

Adding a new environment is as simple as:
Creating a new folder inside the environments directory (or however you have structured your folders)
Copying the apigee-environment.yaml file from any existing environment to the new folder.
If you wish to create new service account and encryption keys for the new environment, copy the secrets.yaml into the new folder and rename the secrets appropriately to distinguish them from the other existing environments (this is usually done by adding the name of the environment as a suffix)
Making appropriate changes to the apigee-environment.yaml , like:
Changing the name of the environment
If new service accounts and encryption keys are going to be created, they need to be correctly referenced in the yaml.
Applying the yaml s:
kubectl apply -f components/environments/new-env-name/secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -f components/environments/new-env-name/apigee-environment.yaml
Using force delete in Apigee Datastore
If datastore delete is not progressing because of any reason, now apigee datastore can be force deleted using the following commands irrespective of the current state of the cluster.
Note: Using force delete will also delete the PVCs. So, if the current Apigee Hybrid deployment is single reason, take a backup before proceeding.
Note: Using force delete in multi region clusters requires manual cleanup in other regions after datastore delete is complete to keep the cassandra in healthy state. Refer to the troubleshooting guide on how to do manual cleanup.
Delete apigeeds in the apigee namespace:
Kubectl delete -n apigee apigeeds default
If this step becomes stuck, you can get out of that using CTRL + C.
Edit a new apigeeds :
Kubectl edit -n apigee apigeeds default
Add/update forceDelete field in apigee datastore spec
spec:
forceDelete: true
Save the file and exit.
Now wait for the datastore to be deleted. It can take a few minutes to delete all the cassandra resources.
Understanding the script
apigee-hybrid-setup.sh script performs some basic validations and helps automate the steps which you would otherwise have to do if you want more detailed customization as documented in Customized Apigee Hybrid installation . Even with the customized installation, you can still partially use the script to help with certain tasks.
You can run ./tools/apigee-hybrid-setup.sh --help to see a list of flags supported and get some extra help with the script. The following flags are supported at the moment:
--namespace By default, the script installs all the components in the apigee namespace. You can change this behavior by specifying the name of the namespace using this flag.
--org Used to provide the name of the Apigee organization. If not specified, defaults to the Google Cloud project currently selected in gcloud
--envgroup Used to provide the name of the environment group inside your organization. If not specified, an attempt is made to query the control plane APIs to determine the name of the environment group. If multiple environment groups are found, error is returned and the script exits.
--env Used to provide the name of the environment inside your organization. If not specified, an attempt is made to query the control plane APIs to determine the name of the environment. If multiple environments are found or the environment is not part of the environment group, error is returned and the script exits.
--cluster-name The Kubernetes cluster name.
--cluster-region The region in which the kubernetes cluster is located
--gcp-project-id The Google Cloud project ID where the kubernetes cluster exists
--ingress-domain Specifies the hostname/domain-name that will be used to generate the self signed TLS certificates for istio ingress-gateway. If none is specified, an attempt is made to determine the value by querying the control plane APIs to get the value from the envgroup. If there were some problems with determining the envgroup or there were multiple hostnames configured for the envgroup, then error is returned and the script exits.
--generate-internal-tls-certs This will generate a kubernetes secret named apigee-ca that contains a certificate and key pair generated by us.
--create-ingress-tls-certs This will generate a secret named {ORG_NAME}-{ENV_GROUP_NAME} (derived from the org and envgroup name) inside the istio-system namespace that will contain a certificate and key pair that will be used for TLS communication. The domain name used to generate these certificates are derived from the value found in the envgroup configuration. In case of conflicts (like when we find multiple domains), appropriate error messages will be shown.
--create-gcp-sa-and-secrets Creates a single Google Cloud service account in the Google Cloud project, downloads the keys, and then creates the kubernetes secrets containing the key. The names of the secrets can be found in Google Cloud service accounts .
--fill-values Replaces the values of the org, env, envgroup and other names wherever they are required in the various yamls.
--apply-configuration This will create the certificate issuers, custom resource definitions, webhooks, roles and the controller resource. Resources will be created in the correct order and command will block until all are healthy.
-- rename-directories Rename the environment and environment group to the names of the correct environment and environment group.
--verbose Shows detailed output for debugging.
--help Display usage information.
--setup-all This will execute all the tasks that can be performed by this script

A version of the above files can be found in the preview-1 tag of the github repository at: https://github.com/apigee/apigee-hybrid-install/releases/tag/preview-1 .
The above folder contains Kubernetes manifests for Apigee hybrid runtime and uses Kustomize for configuration management. The manifests are organized based on the concept of Kustomize bases & overlays . The bases folder contains the minimal required configuration for every apigee component. The overlays folder contains multiple additional features(configurations) that are defined as components .
A component can be by uncommenting the component reference in the kustomization.yaml
Example : To enable the gcs-backup for apigee datastore, the gcs-backup component has been uncommented in the below customization.yaml.
Path : ${INSTALL_DIR}/overlays/instances/${INSTANCE_DIR}/datastore/kustomization.yaml
namespace : "apigee" # kpt-set: ${APIGEE_NAMESPACE}
resources :
- apigee - datastore . yaml
components :
# - ./components/http-proxy
# - ./components/nodeselector/
# - ./components/imagepullsecret
# - ./components/workload-identity
# - ./components/openshift-scc
- ./ components / gcs - backup ( uncommented )
# - ./components/gcs-restore
# - ./components/non-gcs-backup
# - ./components/non-gcs-restore
Any value that requires customisations will have to be set in the corresponding patch.yaml for gcs-backup.
In the below file, the value of CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET_PATH has to be set by the user
Path: $INSTALL_DIR/overlays/instances/$INSTANCE_DIR/datastore/components/gcs-backup/cron-patch.yaml

Likewise, any feature/configuration that requires customizations can be enabled by uncommenting the component in the apigee component's kustomization.yaml. Also, as required the corresponding values for the fields in the component's patch.yaml need to be set accordingly.
Brief explanation of the folders and files:

Storing service account keys in external vaults
Vault (by Hashicorp) is a popular secret management system that has several integrations with secret stores provided by Google, Azure, AWS and others. Hashicorp Vault allows you to fetch secrets from an external source and then use them within kubernetes resources. There are several ways in which one can use Vault to source secrets. The following steps will serve as a basic example about how to use the Vault CSI Provider to mount Google Cloud service account keys stored in some secret engine provided by Vault.
Note: In this example, we are installing Vault in dev mode for testing purposes. For an actual production system, you'd want to install helm one of the other modes listed here . For detailed steps about installing Vault for production use cases, kindly refer Vault on Kubernetes Deployment Guide | Vault .
We'll be using Helm to install Vault related resources in your cluster. Follow the steps in Installing Helm on how to set up helm in your system.
Follow the steps in Install the Vault Helm chart , namely:
Adding the Hashicorp repo to helm
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
Update helm repos
helm repo update
Installing Vault
helm install vault hashicorp/vault \
--set "server.dev.enabled=true" \
--set "injector.enabled=false" \
--set "csi.enabled=true"
Now we'll store the secret inside Vault.
Get a shell inside the vault dev pod
kubectl exec -it vault-0 -- /bin/sh
```
We'll use the key/value secret engine for storing data in this example.
vault kv put secret/runtime-gcp-sa-key key=" ${ BASE_64_ENCODED_KEY } "
To verify that the key was stored successfully, use:
vault kv get secret/runtime-gcp-sa-key
Setup authentication to allow the runtime pod to pull the key. As discussed in Kubernetes service accounts , kubernetes service accounts provide identity to pods and allow them to authenticate with other systems.
Get a shell inside the vault dev pod
kubectl exec -it vault-0 -- /bin/sh
Enable kubernetes authentication method
vault auth enable kubernetes
Write the auth config
vault write auth / kubernetes / config \
issuer = "https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local" \
token_reviewer_jwt = "$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)" \
kubernetes_host = "https://$KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR:443" \
kubernetes_ca_cert = @ / var / run / secrets / kubernetes . io / serviceaccount / ca . crt \
disable_iss_validation = true
Create the auth policy
vault policy write apigee-runtime-app - <<EOF
path "secret/data/runtime-gcp-sa-key" {
capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF
Bind the policy with the service account
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/apigee-runtime-role \
bound_service_account_names=apigee-runtime-sa \
bound_service_account_namespaces= ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } \
policies=apigee-runtime-app \
ttl=20m
Here, we assume that the service account is inside the apigee namespace. If you've some other namespace for installing apigee, you'll be using that name.
Exit the shell inside vault-0
exit
Install secrets store CSI driver
# Add repo to helm
helm repo add secrets-store-csi-driver https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver/master/charts
# Install driver in cluster
helm install csi secrets-store-csi-driver/secrets-store-csi-driver
Create SecretProviderClass kubernetes resource that references the secret that you created inside vault
cat > spc-vault.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
name: vault-apigee-runtime-gcp-sa-key
spec:
provider: vault
parameters:
vaultAddress: "http://vault.default:8200"
roleName: "apigee-runtime-role"
objects: |
- objectName: "client_secret.json"
secretPath: "secret/data/runtime-gcp-sa-key"
secretKey: "key"
EOF
Apply the yaml
kubectl apply -f spc-vault.yaml
Create the kubernetes service account to which we assigned the permissions in step (4.e)
kubectl create serviceaccount -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } apigee-runtime-sa
Modify the apigee-environment.yaml file for the environment and add the following lines:
apiVersion: apigee.cloud.google.com/v1alpha2
kind: ApigeeEnvironment
# existing content
spec:
name: {ENV_NAME}
organizationRef: {ORG_NAME}
components:
runtime:
# existing content
pod
containers:
- name: apigee-runtime
podServiceAccountName: apigee-runtime-sa
# existing content
volumeMounts:
- name: secrets-store-inline
mountPath: "/opt/apigee/sa"
readOnly: true
volumes:
- name: secrets-store-inline
csi:
driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
readOnly: true
volumeAttributes:
secretProviderClass: "vault-apigee-runtime-gcp-sa-key"
Apply the changes:
kubectl apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /environments/ $ENV_NAME
Apigee Hybrid Upgrade
Note: - This procedure covers upgrades between hybrid versions that are supporting the new installation model. It does not cover migration from apigeectl experience to the new installation model.
You should have completed all the requirements mentioned in Prerequisites . Also, it is recommended you do a rolling restart of all the components to check if the cluster is healthy. The order of restarts will be Cassandra, Redis, ApigeeOrganization and ApigeeEnvironment.
Create Backup
Create a backup copy of the current hybrid setup. Backup will be needed in case you need to rollback the upgrade back to the current version.
tar -czvf apigee-hybrid-install.v-X.Y.Z.tar.gz $HYBRID_INSTALL_BASE_DIR
Create backup of cassandra database. Cassandra backups are an important measure of protection against disaster scenarios.
Upgrade your Kubernetes platform if needed
This step is not required every time but you will need to upgrade your Kubernetes platform like kubernetes, openshift and components like cert-manager, cassandra etc version if it is no longer supported by newer version of apigee hybrid. Documentation will contain supported versions of platforms and components.
Download setup files
Download the repository and replace the bases and tools folder in the existing apigee hybrid setup with a newer one:
Clone the GitHub repository preview-1 tag at https://github.com/apigee/apigee-hybrid-install/releases/tag/preview-1
The cloned repository will have a structure resembling the one described in Apigee Hybrid Setup Folder Structure :
replace initialization, tools and controller folder in the existing apigee hybrid setup.
export HYBRID_INSTALL_HOME = PATH_TO_PREVIOUS_HYBRID_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
mv - f bases $ HYBRID_INSTALL_HOME / bases
mv - f tools $ HYBRID_INSTALL_HOME / tools
Update service account permissions if needed
This step is also not required every time but you will need to create a new service account or update permissions of existing service accounts if needed. Upgrade guide will provide the details about which service accounts need to be modified or created and what are the roles needed to be added.
If you need to modify permissions of existing service accounts, use the appropriate gcloud command. The upgrade guide will have detailed commands and roles that need to be added.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
--member="serviceAccount:apigee-component@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role="roles/$NEW_ROLE"
If the newer apigee hybrid version might require an additional service account for new / existing components then you need to create those. You can use the apigee-create-service-account.sh script shipped within the tool folder to create new service accounts. Since the script will be already updated as part of step 4 it will have details and a new profile needed for a new service account that needs to be created.
The newly created service account name has to be referenced in the corresponding component CR.
./ tools / create - service - account -- env prod -- profile apigee - component
Upgrade controller
Change the version fields for the components listed in ${INSTALL_DIR}/overlays/instances/$INSTANCE_DIR/kustomization.yaml to the relevant hybrid version.
Here is a sample $INSTALL_DIR/overlays/instances/$INSTANCE_DIR/kustomization.yaml file. The value of the version field has to be updated to the relevant version
resources:
- datastore/
- environments/
- organization/
- redis/
- route-config/
- telemetry/
patches:
- target:
group: apigee.cloud.google.com
version: v1alpha1
kind: ApigeeDatastore
patch: |-
- op: add
path: /spec/version
value: 1-6-1 (Modify the version)
- target:
group: apigee.cloud.google.com
version: v1alpha2
kind: ApigeeEnvironment
patch: |-
- op: add
path: /spec/version
value: 1-6-1 (Modify the version)
Follow the same set of steps provided in Create initialization resources and controller in apigee hybrid installation workflow. you can use script or can follow provided manual steps to upgrade initialization resources and controller.
Update Apigee Kubernetes components
You will need to make the following changes:
- In case of any architectural changes or introduction of new fields or deprecation of old fields, you will have to modify the CRs with appropriate changes as per the instructions provided in upgrade guide.
- At minimum you need to update the version fields within CRs (which will denote the version of apigee hybrid installed) to the newer apigee hybrid version.
Apply the changes for apigee CRs. For non-prod environment, you can apply all changes to apigee components simultaneously
kubectl apply -f ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR }
Apigee Hybrid Rollback
Restore apigee-hybrid-setup
Move to the directory that contains the previous version of apigee hybrid setup. If not available, restore it from the zip file created in step 1[link] during apigee hybrid upgrade.
Rollback Kubernetes components
Apply the changes for apigee CRs
kubectl apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR }
Rollback controller
Follow the same set of steps provided create initialization resources and controller in apigee hybrid installation workflow. you can use a script or can follow provided manual steps to rollback initialization resources and controller.
Cleanup
You will need to clean up any new additional resources created during upgrade like new components or service accounts introduced in the newer version of hybrid. What all resources need to be cleaned up and steps to clean them up will be provided in the upgrade guide.
Deleting an environment
Caution: If you have multiple environments, make sure whatever secrets you are deleting are not referenced in the other environments. To check that, do kubectl get env -n ${APIGEE_NAMESPACE} ${ENV_RESOURCE_NAME} -o yaml and then grep for whatever resource you plan on deleting.
Following are the steps to delete all resources related to an environment from your kubernetes cluster:
Get the name of the environment CR. This can be done by getting all the environments:
kubectl get env -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE }
Store the resource name in APIGEE_ENV environment variable.
Delete the environment encryption keys. For example, if you had not change the name of the encryption keys, then you can delete them by using:
kubectl delete secret -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } $APIGEE_ENV -encryption-keys
Delete Google Cloud service account secrets:
kubectl delete secret -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } $(kubectl get env $APIGEE_ENV -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } -o=jsonpath='{.spec.components.*.appServiceAccountSecretName}')
Delete kubernetes service accounts:
kubectl delete secret -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } $(kubectl get env $APIGEE_ENV -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } -o=jsonpath='{.spec.components.*.podServiceAccountName}')
Delete the Apigee environment custom resource:
kubectl -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } delete env $APIGEE_ENV
Deleting a hybrid setup
Caution: This is how the steps will appear for normal apigee hybrid installation, steps will slightly differ for advanced cases like having second organization within same cluster etc.
Following are the steps to delete all resources related to apigee hybrid from your kubernetes cluster:
You will need to delete apigee user setup and schema setup jobs.
# To list all jobs in ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE }
kubectl -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } get jobs
# To delete all jobs in ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE }
kubectl -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } delete jobs $(kubectl -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } get jobs -o custom-columns=':.metadata.name')
You will need to delete the deployed apigee hybrid dataplane components. Use the following command to delete all components:
kubectl delete -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ $INSTANCE_NAME
This step is only required if you have not relied on the default name for kubernetes service account secrets, Google Cloud service account secrets etc. If you have relied on default names then it would be deleted in next step otherwise you will need to delete them manually using following commands:
kubectl delete secret -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } $(kubectl get ${ APIGEE_COMPONENT } ${ APIGEE_COMPONENT_NAME } -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } -o=jsonpath='{.spec.components.*.appServiceAccountSecretName}')
kubectl delete secret -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } $(kubectl get ${ APIGEE_COMPONENT } ${ APIGEE_COMPONENT_NAME } -n ${ APIGEE_NAMESPACE } -o=jsonpath='{.spec.components.*.podServiceAccountName}')
In case of OpenShift, you will need to delete scc (Security Context Constraints) created during installation of apigee hybrid.
kubectl delete scc ${ SECURITY_CONTEXT_CONSTRAINTS_NAME }
Run the below command to delete roles, rolebindings, CRDs, controller deployments etc.
kubectl delete -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/ingress
kubectl delete -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/rbac
kubectl delete -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/webhooks
kubectl delete -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/crds
kubectl delete -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/certificates
Run the below command to delete apigee namespace
kubectl delete -f ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/initialization/namespace.yaml
Alternatively, use the command:
kubectl delete $APIGEE_NAMESPACE
Multi Instance Installation
Multi instance setup refers to the hybrid setup that can span across multiple regions or within the same regions too. Apigee recommends organizing the configurations of the 2nd instance in a separate directory structure as the environment configurations (replicas,etc) are invariably different between instances. Configurations of every instance are decoupled and are organized independently in their respective folder structures.
For example - For an Active-Passive setup in a multi region scenario, you may want to configure a 2nd region in a warm standby with different sizings, configs.
In the folder structure below, you can make a copy of instance1 directory called instance2 and modify the datastore and ingress configurations as needed.

Multi Instance setup on GKE
Prerequisites
Before configuring multiple instances of hybrid, you are expected have completed the following prerequisites:
Set up Kubernetes clusters in multiple regions(same or different) with different CIDR blocks
Set up cross-region communication
Open Cassandra ports 7000 and 7001 between Kubernetes clusters across all regions (7000 may be used as a backup option during troubleshooting). See also Configure ports .
Note: Apigee recommends that you ensure that your servers' times are
synchronized. Several features such as expiration and token revocation rely on
accurate system times. If you host the runtime components in different
datacenters, then be sure that the system times are synchronized.
You can use a tool such as ntpdate to verify that server times are synchronized.
Configure the multi-region seed host
Make a copy of the $INSTANCE_NAME folder from your existing instance and add it under instances folder.
Modify the value of the namespace field if it differs from instance1 namespace.
Follow the steps specified in Specifying ingress TLS certificates to modify the ingress configuration for the other instance.
Refer to the Managing Apigee ingress gateway for information on configuring the load balancer ip for the other instance
Note: It is recommended not to modify the configurations of the rest of the components except the ones listed out in the upcoming steps.
Set the kubectl context to the original cluster before retrieving the seed name
kubectl config use-context original-cluster-name
Run the following kubectl command to identify a seed host address for Cassandra in the current region.
kubectl get pods -o wide -n apigee -l app=apigee-cassandra
Any of the Pod IPs returned from the previous command can be considered as the multi-region seed host.
In the 2nd instance, configure the value of multiRegionSeedHost in the apigee datastore CR under ${INSTALL_DIR}/overlays/instances/${INSTANCE_DIR}/datastore/apigee-datastore.yaml
Set up the new instance
Set the context to the existing cluster
kubectl config use-context existing-cluster-name
Export the apigee-ca secret to a file
kubectl -n cert-manager get secret apigee-root-certificate -o yaml > apigee-root-certificate.yaml
Set the context to the new region's cluster name:
kubectl config use-context NEW_CLUSTER_NAME
Import the secret to the new cluster
kubectl -n cert-manager apply -f apigee-root-certificate.yaml
Install hybrid in the new instance (region) by following the steps outlined in Create initialization resources and controller .
Set up Cassandra on all the pods in the new data centers. Get apigeeorg from the cluster with the following command:
kubectl get apigeeorg -n apigee -o json | jq ".items[].metadata.name"
Create a cassandra data replication custom resource (YAML) file. The file can have any name. In the following examples the file will have the name datareplication.yaml.
The file must contain the following
apiVersion: apigee . cloud . google . com / v1alpha1
kind: CassandraDataReplication
metadata:
name: REGION_EXPANSION
namespace: NAMESPACE
spec:
organizationRef: APIGEEORG_VALUE
force : false
source:
region: SOURCE_REGION
Where:
REGION_EXPANSION is the name you are giving this metadata. You can choose a name like "cassandra-data-replication"
NAMESPACE is the same namespace that was chosen for the 2nd instance. This is usually "apigee".
APIGEEORG_VALUE is the value output from the kubectl get apigeeorg -n apigee -o json | jq ".items[].metadata.name" command in the previous step.
SOURCE_REGION is the value of the value of cassandra datacenter from the nodetool status from the source cluster.
Apply the CassandraDataReplication with the following command:
kubectl apply -f datareplication.yaml
Verify the rebuild status using the following command.
Note: The rebuild operation can take up to several hours depending on the data size.
kubectl -n apigee get apigeeds -o json | jq ".items[].status.cassandraDataReplication"
The result should look something like
{
"rebuildDetails": {
"apigee-cassandra-default-0": {
"state": "complete",
"updated": 1623105760
},
"apigee-cassandra-default-1": {
"state": "complete",
"updated": 1623105765
},
"apigee-cassandra-default-2": {
"state": "complete",
"updated": 1623105770
}
},
"state": "complete",
"updated": 1623105770
}
Verify the rebuild processes from the logs. Also, verify the data size using the nodetool status command:
kubectl logs apigee-cassandra-default-0 -f -n apigee
Refer the datastore/secrets.yaml for the JMX_user and JMX_password
kubectl exec apigee - cassandra - default - 0 - n apigee -- nodetool - u JMX_user - pw JMX_password status
Remove multiRegionSeedHost from the apigee datastore CR and run the below command to apply the change
kubectl apply k apply -k ${ INSTALL_DIR } /overlays/instances/ ${ INSTANCE_DIR } /datastore
Check the Cassandra cluster status
The following command is useful to see if the cluster setup is successful in two data centers. The command checks the nodetool status for the two regions.
kubectl exec apigee - cassandra - default - 0 - n apigee -- nodetool - u JMX_user - pw JMX_password status

Manual Cleanup after using forceDelete in multi Region Apigee Hybrid setup
In the following example, there are 2 regions - us-east1 and us-west1 .
In the us-west1 region, apigee datastore was deleted using force delete.
In the us-east1 region, cassandra is still up and running.
Verify apigeeds is deleted using command
kubectl get apigeeds -n apigee
No resources found in apigee namespace.
Change the kubectl context to the other region where the cassandra cluster is still up and running (here us-east1 ) region.
Verify datastore is in running state
kubectl get apigeeds -n apigee
NAME STATE AGE
default running 23h
Exec into one of cassandra pods in up region (here us-east1 ) region
kubectl exec - it - n apigee apigee - cassandra - default - 0 -- bash
apigee @apigee - cassandra - default - 0 : ~ $
Check nodetool status, it will show all nodes down in the deleted region (here us-west1 ) region
apigee @ apigee - cassandra - default - 0 : ~$ nodetool - u $ { APIGEE_JMX_USER } - pw $ { APIGEE_JMX_PASSWORD } status
