Organizing client app ownership

This page describes tools and strategies used to organize client app ownership.
Using AppGroups to organize app ownership
This section provides an overview of AppGroups and how to manage them.
What are AppGroups?
An AppGroup represents a relationship between one or more apps that are managed by the same
set of people.
An AppGroup is associated with another system that is responsible for managing the roster of
people who share responsibility for these apps, such as a portal. Both Apigee apps and
Apigee developers are associated to the AppGroup.
Important: AppGroups provide an abstraction to manage grouped
developers as a single entity for the purposes of app ownership and management. Since API
access is managed at the credential level for each app, a group of
developers that are members of an AppGroup can manage and own AppGroup apps as a single entity.
Note that permissions and API key management are handled at the app level, separately from
AppGroup membership.
AppGroups provide:
A method of organizing and viewing app ownership and associations.
The ability to create a roster for a portal or API storefront of workers who are
responsible for an app. For example, you might set up different AppGroups for billing
purposes.
Flexibility for tracking app ownership by partner, business unit, product line, division,
or other corporate entities.
A potentially multi-level structure for tracking how apps are logically related to app
owners and developers.
Monetization integration. Manage subscriptions for groups of app developers by using
AppGroups to subscribe to API products with rate plans. For information, see
Use AppGroups to manage API product subscriptions .
IAM roles and permissions
To control permissions required for AppGroup management, you can view and grant permissions or
roles using the permissions panel on the IAM & Admin > IAM
page in your Google Cloud project.
Go to IAM & Admin
The following table lists the permissions required to create and manage AppGroups resources.
You can grant the permissions individually or through an Apigee role including the permissions.
See Users and
roles for information on Apigee user and role management.
Description
Permissions
Manage AppGroups and associated apps and keys.
apigee.appgroups.list
apigee.appgroups.get
apigee.appgroups.create
apigee.appgroups.update
apigee.appgroups.delete
Manage AppGroup apps.
apigee.appgroupapps.list
apigee.appgroupapps.get
apigee.appgroupapps.create
apigee.appgroupapps.manage
apigee.appgroupapps.delete
Manage app keys for AppGroups:
apigee.appkeys.get
apigee.appkeys.create
apigee.appkeys.manage
apigee.appkeys.delete
Manage AppGroup subscriptions and monetization configurations.
apigee.appgroupbalances.adjust
apigee.appgroupbalances.get
apigee.appgroupbalances.update
apigee.appgroupmonetizationconfigs.get
apigee.appgroupmonetizationconfigs.update
apigee.appgroupsubscriptions.create
apigee.appgroupsubscriptions.get
apigee.appgroupsubscriptions.list
apigee.appgroupsubscriptions.update
Viewing and managing AppGroups
This section shows how to view and manage AppGroups. You can manage
AppGroups and AppGroup apps
via the Apigee APIs and
Drupal portals .
Note: AppGroup management in Apigee UI in Cloud console will
be considered in a future release.
Note: To manage the Display Name and Notes of an App associated with an AppGroup, you should use the DisplayName and Notes attribute in the
organizations.appgroups.apps.update method .
Note: We recommend that you avoid making concurrent update requests for the same resource. Near-simultaneous writes to the same entity can result in conflicts and unexpected behavior. Ensure operations are sequential when modifying a single resource.
AppGroup settings
AppGroups include these settings:
Setting
Description
Name
Required. The AppGroup name. AppGroup names must be unique across an
organization. Allowed characters are alphanumeric characters and any
of these special characters: ._\-$ %.
AppGroup Id
Created automatically and not editable. Created in the form
"OrgName@@@AppGroupName". For example, with an Apigee org name XYZDev and
AppGroup name ABCMarketing , the AppGroup Id is
XYZDev@@@ABCMarketing .
Display Name
Optional. A friendly display name for the AppGroup.
channelId
Optional. Identifies the system responsible for creating and managing the AppGroup.
This could be a storefront or marketplace. Multiple AppGroups might share the
same channelId.
channelUri
Optional. Reference to the group of people who share responsibility for the
AppGroup. Often the channelUri links to or refers to a group or team in a
developer portal or other system such as Apigee's Drupal Teams module.
Managing AppGroups using Drupal-based portals
Apigee's Team module for Drupal works with AppGroups in Apigee X and hybrid and is the primary
interface for managing AppGroups. For information on
Drupal-based portals, see
Building your Portal using Drupal .
Managing AppGroups using the Apigee APIs
Use these APIs to manage AppGroups in your orgs:

Migrating from Apigee Edge for Drupal users
Migrating a company-developer and its role involves creating an AppGroup representing the
company, and adding the company-developer and its role(s) as custom Attributes of the AppGroup.
The expected syntax to store this is:
[{
"developer":"<developer email>",
"roles":[
"<role(s)>"
]
},
...
]
Using developer-app association to organize app ownership
A less comprehensive and flexible method of tracking app ownership than AppGroups is tracking
apps by developer association.
For information on managing developer-app associations, see
Registering app developers
for information on registering developers and associated apps.
