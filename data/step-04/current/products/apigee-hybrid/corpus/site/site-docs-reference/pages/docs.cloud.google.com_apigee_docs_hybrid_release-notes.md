v1.16.0
Announcement
hybrid v1.16.0
On December 19, 2025 we released an updated version of the Apigee hybrid software, 1.16.0.
For information on upgrading, see Upgrading Apigee hybrid to version v1.16 .
For information on new installations, see The big picture .
Note: This is a minor release: The container images used in minor releases are integrated with the Apigee hybrid Helm charts. Upgrading to a minor via the Helm chart automatically updates the images. No manual image changes are typically needed. For information on container image support in Apigee hybrid releases, see Apigee release process .
v1.16.0
Feature
Seccomp Profiles
Apigee Hybrid now offers the capability to apply Seccomp Profiles to your runtime components, significantly enhancing the security posture of your deployment.
This feature allows Apigee administrators and security teams to restrict the system calls (syscalls) a containerized process can make to the host's kernel. By limiting a container to only the necessary syscalls, you can:
Enhance Security: Mitigate the risk of container breakouts and privilege escalation.
Enforce Least Privilege: Ensure components only have access to the exact system calls required for their operation.
Meet Compliance: Provide a critical control for meeting stringent security compliance requirements.
Seccomp profiles are not enabled by default. To enable the feature, see Configure Seccomp profiles for pod security .
v1.16.0
Feature
apigee-guardrails service account
In v1.16.0, Apigee Hybrid introduces an apigee-guardrails Google IAM service account. This is used by the apigee-operator chart during initial installation to check that all needed APIs are enabled in your project.
Note: The apigee-guardrails service account is required for both upgraded and new installations. See Upgrading to Apigee hybrid to version 1.16: Set up the apigee-guardrails service account for upgrade instructions.
See:
Diagnosing issues with guardrails

Upgrading to Apigee hybrid to version 1.16
Installation Part 2: Step 4: Create service accounts
Installation Part 2: Step 5: Set up service account authentication
v1.16.0
Change
UDCA component removed
In Apigee hybrid v1.16, the Unified Data Collection Agent (UDCA) component has been removed. The responsibilities of sending analytics, trace, and deployment status data to the Apigee control plane are now handled using a Google Cloud Pub/Sub based data pipeline. Using the Pub/Sub based data pipeline has been the default data collection mechanism since Apigee hybrid v1.14.0 .
v1.16.0
Change
Support for cert-manager release 1.18 and 1.19
Apigee hybrid v1.16 supports cert-manager release 1.18 and 1.19.
Note: cert-manager release 1.18 introduces a change to the default certificate Spec.PrivateKey.RotationPolicy value that can impact traffic on upgraded Apigee hybrid installations. This does not affect new installations of Apigee Hybrid. See Known issue 465834046 .

v1.15.1
Announcement
hybrid v1.15.1
On October 10, 2025 we released an updated version of the Apigee hybrid software, 1.15.1.
For information on upgrading, see Upgrading Apigee hybrid to version 1.15 .
For information on new installations, see The big picture .
Note: This is a patch release: The container images used in patch releases are integrated with the Apigee hybrid Helm charts. Upgrading to a patch via the Helm chart automatically updates the images. No manual image changes are typically needed. For information on container image support in Apigee hybrid releases, see Apigee release process .
v1.15.1
Feature
Recurring, top-up, and setup fees for Apigee hybrid monetization
Apigee hybrid now supports recurring, top-up, and setup fees for monetization. For information see Enabling monetization for Apigee hybrid .
v1.15.1
Feature
Apigee policies for LLM/GenAI workloads
Apigee hybrid now supports the following Apigee policies with support for LLM/GenAI workloads.
SemanticCacheLookup policy
SemanticCachePopulate policy
SanitizeUserPrompt
SanitizeModelResponse
The Apigee semantic caching policies enable intelligent response reuse based on semantic similarity. Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can minimize redundant backend API calls, reduce latency, and lower operational costs. With this release, the semantic caching policies support URL templating, enabling the use of variables for AI model endpoint values.
The Model Armor policies protect your AI applications by sanitizing user prompts to and responses from large language models (LLMs). Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can mitigate the risks associated with LLM usage by leveraging Model Armor to detect prompt injection, prevent jailbreak attacks, apply responsible AI filters, filter malicious URLs, and protect sensitive data.
Note: In Apigee hybrid, this feature has the following limitations:
Support for these policies is limited to installations on Google Cloud Platform.
Apigee hybrid does not support forward proxy with these policies.
For more information on using these policies in your Apigee API proxies, see:
Get started with semantic caching policies
Get started with Apigee Model Armor policies

v1.15.0
Announcement
hybrid v1.15.0
On June 4, 2025 we released an updated version of the Apigee hybrid software, 1.15.0.
For information on upgrading, see Upgrading Apigee hybrid to version 1.15 .
For information on new installations, see The big picture .
Note: This is a minor release: The container images used in minor releases are integrated with the Apigee hybrid Helm charts. Upgrading to a minor via the Helm chart automatically updates the images. No manual image changes are typically needed. For information on container image support in Apigee hybrid releases, see Apigee release process .
v1.15.0
Feature
Large message payload support in Apigee hybrid
Apigee now supports message payloads up to 30MB. You configure support for large message payloads in Apigee hybrid for individual environments or for your whole installation. See Configure large message payload support in Apigee hybrid .

1.14.2-hotfix.1
Announcement
hybrid 1.14.2-hotfix.1
On May 16, 2025 we released an updated version of the Apigee hybrid software, 1.14.2-hotfix.1.
Important: If your installation is already on Apigee hybrid v1.14.2, use the following procedure to apply this hotfix. If your installation is on 1.14.1 or older, follow the instructions in Upgrading Apigee hybrid to version 1.14 .
Apply this hotfix with the following steps:
Download the apigee-org and apigee-env charts with the 1.14.2-hotfix.1 version tag:
export CHART_REPO=oci://us-docker.pkg.dev/apigee-release/apigee-hybrid-helm-charts
export CHART_VERSION=1.14.2-hotfix.1
helm pull $CHART_REPO/apigee-env --version $CHART_VERSION --untar
helm pull $CHART_REPO/apigee-org --version $CHART_VERSION --untar
Optional : Perform this step if you need to allow use of the allOf combinator along with setting additionalProperties: true in your OAS spec. See fixed bug 393615439 .
Add the following stanza to your overrides.yaml :
runtime:
cwcAppend:
conf_message-processor-communication_oas.disable.resolve.combinator: true
Install the hotfix release:
Update the apigee-env chart with the helm upgrade command and your current overrides file for each environment in your Apigee org:
Dry run:
helm upgrade ENV_RELEASE_NAME apigee-env/ \
--namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \
--set env= ENV_NAME \
--atomic \
-f OVERRIDES_FILE \
--dry-run=server
ENV_RELEASE_NAME is a name used to keep track of installation and upgrades of the apigee-env chart . This name must be unique from the other Helm release names in your installation. Usually this is the same as ENV_NAME . However, if your environment has the same name as your environment group, you must use different release names for the environment and environment group, for example dev-env-release and dev-envgroup-release . For more information on releases in Helm, see Three big concepts in the Helm documentation.
APIGEE_NAMESPACE is your installation's namespace. The default is apigee .
ENV_NAME is the name of the environment you are upgrading.

1.14.2-hotfix.1
Fixed
Bug ID
Description
393615439
OASValidation behavior for allOf with additionalProperties: true .
Issue
The OASValidation policy in Apigee Hybrid versions 1.12 and later may incorrectly reject requests when validating against an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) that uses combinator keywords ( allOf , oneOf , anyOf ) and allows additional properties ( additionalProperties: true ) within the combined schema. This occurs because the default behavior resolves combinators into an aggregated schema before validation, but an underlying issue in the parser library can cause the additionalProperties definition to be handled incorrectly during this resolution. This behavior differs from Apigee Edge and older Apigee Hybrid versions.
Resolution
A configuration flag has been introduced to control this behavior. By setting this flag, you can disable the pre-validation combinator resolution step, reverting to the behavior consistent with Apigee Edge and older Hybrid versions.
Validation errors in Apigee hybrid
If you encounter the validation errors described above, particularly for specs that worked correctly in Apigee Edge or Hybrid versions prior to 1.12, you can revert to the previous validation behavior by setting the following flag for the apigee-runtime container:
conf_message-processor-communication_oas.disable.resolve.combinator = true
Note: Reverting to the older behavior (by setting the flag to true) reintroduces the older limitation: When using allOf , the additionalProperties keyword must be explicitly set to true if you intend to make the inheritance work correctly. The older behavior does not correctly handle schema validation with allOf when additionalProperties is set to false or is undefined. Customers migrating from Edge/OPDK or older hybrid versions should already be working around this limitation.

Announcement
hybrid 1.11.2-hotfix.3
On April 14, 2025 we released an updated version of the Apigee hybrid software, 1.11.2-hotfix.3.
Apply this hotfix with the following steps:
In your overrides file, update the image.url and image.tag properties of ao and runtime :
runtime:
image:
url: "gcr.io/apigee-release/hybrid/apigee-runtime"
tag: "1.11.2-hotfix.3"
Install the hotfix release:
For Helm-managed releases, update the apigee-env chart with the helm upgrade command and your current overrides files:
For each environment in your Apigee org:
helm upgrade ENV_RELEASE_NAME apigee-env/ \
--namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \
--set env=ENV_NAME \
--atomic \
-f OVERRIDES_FILE
ENV_RELEASE_NAME is a name used to keep track of installation and upgrades of the apigee-env chart . This name must be unique from the other Helm release names in your installation. Usually this is the same as ENV_NAME . However, if your environment has the same name as your environment group, you must use different release names for the environment and environment group, for example dev-env-release and dev-envgroup-release . For more information on releases in Helm, see Three big concepts in the Helm documentation.
APIGEE_NAMESPACE is your installation's namespace. The default is apigee .
ENV_NAME is the name of the environment you are upgrading.
OVERRIDES_FILE is your edited overrides file.
For apigeectl -managed releases:
Install the hotfix release with apigeectl init using your updated overrides file:
${ APIGEECTL_HOME } /apigeectl init -f OVERRIDES_FILE --dry-run=client
Followed by:
${ APIGEECTL_HOME } /apigeectl init -f OVERRIDES_FILE
Apply the hotfix release with apigeectl apply :
${ APIGEECTL_HOME } /apigeectl apply -f OVERRIDES_FILE --all-envs --dry-run=client

Manage process ID limits
The procedure to manage the process ID limits in your clusters has been added to the documentation.
A Process ID limit is a Kubernetes resource constraint on nodes and pods to prevent excessive process creation, which can impact node stability.

Rotating Cassandra credentials in Vault: Rolling back a rotation
Rotating Cassandra credentials in Kubernetes secrets: Rolling back a rotation
v1.14.0
Feature
Enable and disable metrics-based scaling with customAutoscaling.enabled
Starting in version v1.14, you can enable and disable metrics-based auto-scaling with the customAutoscaling.enabled configuration property. See:
Scale and autoscale runtime services: Metrics-based scaling
customAutoscaling.enabled
v1.14.0
Feature
Guardrails checks to ensure backups before upgrade
Starting in version 1.14 new guardrails checks have been added to ensure a backup is enabled and has been made before proceeding with an upgrade. See:
Upgrading Apigee hybrid to version v1.14
Diagnosing issues with guardrails
v1.14.0
Feature
Forward Proxy allowlist access
Starting in version v1.14, forward proxies pass through access to allowlisted URLs. Therefore you only need to configure allowlists to googleapis.com URLs on the server on which the forward proxy is configured. See:
Google Cloud URLs to allow for Hybrid
Using Data Residency with Apigee hybrid: URL allowlisting
Configure forward proxying for API proxies
v1.14.0
Feature
Enhanced Per-environment Proxy Limits in Apigee Hybrid
Starting in version v1.14, new Apigee hybrid organizations can be provisioned with the ability to deploy more than 50 proxies per environment enabled. This feature is already available for Apigee X .
Starting with Apigee hybrid version 1.14, the limits for Apigee hybrid organizations have increased:
The maximum number of deployed API proxies and shared flows per organization is 6000.
The maximum number of proxy deployment units per Apigee instance is 6000.
The maximum number of API base paths per Apigee organization is 3000.
When more than 50 proxies are deployed in an environment, Apigee will automatically partition the environment into several distinct replica sets, each containing a subset of proxies deployed in the environment. These replica subsets are equivalent in behavior and infrastructure resource usage to a single environment in the way it loads and runs a set of proxies and other environment resources. This will be transparent to the user, and you can continue to use the environment as you would a single environment.
Note: Enhanced per-environment proxy limits are only available for new hybrid organizations with the entitlement for the feature included in Subscription 2024 . Enhanced per-environment proxy limits are not available in upgraded organizations.
See:
Enhanced per-environment proxy limits

For information on upgrading, see Upgrading Apigee hybrid to version v1.13.0 .
For information on new installations, see The big picture .
v1.13.0
Feature
Improved backup and restore
Starting in version v1.13.0, Apigee hybrid introduces a new backup and restore system. The new system removes the need for pod exec permission and use of a Kubernetes ClusterRole, and requires fewer Kubernetes Service Accounts when using Workload Identity. The new system replaces use of the apigee-cassandra-backup-utility image by using the apigee-hybrid-cassandra-client image. The apigee-cassandra-backup-utility image will no longer be provided starting with this release.
To use the new functionality if you are overriding the image used, update your overrides.yaml file.
Replace:
repo.sample.com/gcr-docker/apigee-release/hybrid/apigee-cassandra-backup-utility
with
repo.sample.com/gcr-docker/apigee-release/hybrid/apigee-hybrid-cassandra-client
under cassandra.backup.image.url and cassandra.restore.image.url .
See Scheduling backups in a remote server for more information.
v1.13.0
Feature
Leader election enabled for apigee-watcher component
Starting in version v1.13.0, leader election is enabled for the apigee-watcher component. For proper functioning of the leader election, make sure that the apigee-watcher component uses only one replica set.
v1.13.0
Feature
Apigee Operator now runs in the Apigee Kubernetes namespace
Starting in version v1.13, apigee-operator runs in the same name space as the other Apigee hybrid components instead of the apigee-system namespace. You can use apigee or your own custom Apigee namespace. See Upgrading Apigee hybrid to version v1.13.0 and Step 3: Create the apigee namespace .
v1.13.0
Feature
Storing additional secrets in an external secret store
Starting in version v1.13, You can now store AX Hash Salt, Redis password, and Encryption keys in an external secret store like Hashicorp Vault. See Storing Secrets in Vault .

Announcement
hybrid 1.11.2-hotfix.2
On July 31, 2024 we released an updated version of the Apigee hybrid software, 1.11.2-hotfix.2.
Note: This release reflects a change to the component images and not the Helm chart templates. If your hybrid installation is currently on Apigee hybrid v1.11.2, Apply this hotfix with the following steps:
In your overrides file, update the image.url and image.tag properties of ao and runtime :
ao:
image:
url: "gcr.io/apigee-release/hybrid/apigee-operators"
tag: "1.11.2-hotfix.2"
runtime:
image:
url: "gcr.io/apigee-release/hybrid/apigee-runtime"
tag: "1.11.2-hotfix.2"
Install the hotfix release:
For Helm-managed releases, update the apigee-operator with the helm upgrade command and your current overrides files:
helm upgrade operator apigee-operator/ \
--namespace apigee-system \
--atomic \
-f overrides.yaml
For each environment in your Apigee org:
helm upgrade ENV_RELEASE_NAME apigee-env/ \
--namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \
--set env=ENV_NAME \
--atomic \
-f overrides.yaml
ENV_RELEASE_NAME is a name used to keep track of installation and upgrades of the apigee-env chart . This name must be unique from the other Helm release names in your installation. Usually this is the same as ENV_NAME . However, if your environment has the same name as your environment group, you must use different release names for the environment and environment group, for example dev-env-release and dev-envgroup-release . For more information on releases in Helm, see Three big concepts in the Helm documentation.
APIGEE_NAMESPACE is your installation's namespace. The default is apigee .
ENV_NAME is the name of the environment you are upgrading.
For apigeectl -managed releases:
install the hotfix release with apigeectl init using your updated overrides file:
${ APIGEECTL_HOME } /apigeectl init -f OVERRIDES_FILE --dry-run=client
Followed by:
${ APIGEECTL_HOME } /apigeectl init -f OVERRIDES_FILE
Apply the hotfix release with apigeectl apply :
${ APIGEECTL_HOME } /apigeectl apply -f OVERRIDES_FILE --all-envs --dry-run=client
Followed by:

Announcement
hybrid v1.11.0
On November 17, 2023 we released an updated version of the Apigee hybrid software, v1.11.0.
For information on upgrading, see Upgrading Apigee hybrid to version v1.11.0 .
For information on new installations, see The big picture .
v1.11.0
Feature
Helm charts management for Apigee hybrid
Starting in version v1.11.0, you have the choice of installing and managing your clusters with either Helm or apigeectl . You cannot manage a cluster with both. Apigee recommends using Helm for new hybrid installations. See Apigee hybrid Helm charts reference .
v1.11.0
Feature
Apigee Advance API Security Actions for Apigee hybrid
Advanced API Security's new Security Actions feature is now available in Apigee hybrid.
v1.11.0
Feature
With this release, the HeaderName element is available as a child element of Authentication . This element appears in the ServiceCallout and ExternalCallout policies, and in the TargetEndpoint proxy configuration .
By default, when an Authentication configuration is present, Apigee generates and injects a bearer token into the Authorization header, in the message sent to the target system. The new HeaderName element allows you to specify the name of a different header to hold that bearer token.
v1.11.0
Feature
Vault integration for Cassandra credentials (preview)
Starting in version v1.11.0, you can store Cassandra credentials in Hashicorp Vault. Note: Using Vault requires Helm management of your Apigee installation. See Storing Cassandra credentials in Hashicorp Vault .
Vault integration is in preview as of the Apigee hybrid 1.11.0 release.

Bug ID
Description
259738092
Intermittent 404's were seen at the Apigee Ingress Gateway due to an inconsistent configuration delivery mechanism.
255677576
In fresh installations with Apigee Ingress (instead of user-installed Anthos Service Mesh), the Apigee UI would sometimes show red (not working) status. This is because in certain circumstances Watcher did not send the correct deployment status due to using the wrong selector for the Apigee Ingress Gateway.
218567150
The ingress gateway is now configured to consistently preserve UUID in the x-request-id header. This applies to both Apigee Ingress gateway and to the Istio ingress gateway when are using customer-installed Anthos Service Mesh. Note: This setting does have some impact on tracing in the ingress gateway. For more information, see pack_trace_reason in the "UUID (proto)" page in the envoy documentation .

preview
Announcement
hybrid new installation experience public preview
On September 30, 2022 we released the public preview of the new Apigee hybrid installation experience.
Overview
The new Apigee hybrid installation experience provides a Kubernetes way of installing Apigee components using kubectl . The enhanced validations and visibility of the components being installed provides better debuggability and improves the overall install process.
An install script, apigee-hybrid-setup.sh , provides an easy tool for basic installation. You can use that to create your hybrid installation and then modify it to fit your needs with kubectl , or you can create your hybrid installation from scratch using kubectl . All Apigee hybrid configuration properties are stored in yaml files, one for each major component. This allows much more granular control of your hybrid installation on your Kubernetes environment.
