You can scale most services running in Kubernetes from the
command line or in a configuration override. You can set scaling
parameters for Apigee hybrid runtime services in the
overrides.yaml file .
Service
Implemented As
Scaling
Cassandra
ApigeeDatastore (CRD)
See Scaling Cassandra .
Ingress/LoadBalancer
Deployment
Cloud Service Mesh uses Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPAs).
Logger
DaemonSet
DaemonSets manage replicas of a pod on all nodes, so they scale
when you scale the pods themselves.
MART
Apigee Connect
Watcher
ApigeeOrganization (CRD)
To scale via configuration, increase the value of the
Deployment's replicaCountMin configuration property
for the mart , watcher , and/or connectAgent stanzas.
For example:
mart:
replicaCountMax: 2
replicaCountMin: 1
watcher:
replicaCountMax: 2
replicaCountMin: 1
connectAgent:
replicaCountMax: 2
replicaCountMin: 1
These Deployments use a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for autoscaling. Set
the Deployment object's targetCPUUtilizationPercentage
property to the threshold for scaling up; when this value is
exceeded, Kubernetes adds pods up to the value of
replicaCountMax .
For more information on setting configuration properties, see
Manage runtime plane components .
Runtime
Synchronizer
UDCA
ApigeeEnvironment (CRD)
To scale via configuration, increase the value of the
replicaCountMin property for the udca , synchronizer ,
and/or runtime
stanzas in the overrides file. For example:
synchronizer:
replicaCountMax: 10
replicaCountMin: 1
runtime:
replicaCountMax: 10
replicaCountMin: 1
udca:
replicaCountMax: 10
replicaCountMin: 1
Note: These changes apply to ALL environments in the overrides file.
If you wish to customize scaling for each environment see Advanced configurations below.
These deployments use a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for
autoscaling. Set the Deployment object's
targetCPUUtilizationPercentage property to the
threshold for scaling up; when this value is exceeded, Kubernetes
adds pods up to the value of replicaCountMax .
For more information on setting configuration properties, see
Manage runtime plane components .
Advanced configurations
In some scenarios, you may need to use advanced scaling options. Example scenarios include:
Setting different scaling options for each environment. For example, where env1 has
a minReplica of 5 and env2 has a minReplica of 2.
Setting different scaling options for each component within an environment. For example,
where the udca component has a maxReplica of 5 and the
synchronizer component has a maxReplica of 2.
The following example shows how to use the kubernetes patch command to change
the maxReplicas property for the runtime component:
Create environment variables to use with the command:
export ENV_NAME= my-environment-name
export ENV_RELEASE_NAME= $ENV_NAME # the Helm release name for the environment
export APIGEE_NAMESPACE= apigee #the namespace where Apigee is deployed
export COMPONENT=runtime #can be udca or synchronizer
export MAX_REPLICAS=2
export MIN_REPLICAS=1
Apply the patch. Note that this example assumes that kubectl is in your PATH :
kubectl patch apigeeenvironment -n $APIGEE_NAMESPACE \
$(kubectl get apigeeenvironments -n $APIGEE_NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.spec.name == "'$ENV'" )]..metadata.name}') \
--patch "$(echo -e "spec:\n components:\n $COMPONENT:\n autoScaler:\n maxReplicas: $MAX_REPLICAS\n minReplicas: $MIN_REPLICAS")" \
--type merge
Verify the change:
kubectl get hpa -n $APIGEE_NAMESPACE
Environment-based scaling
By default, scaling is described at the organization level. You can
override the default settings by specifying environment-specific scaling
in the overrides.yaml file as shown in the following example:
envs:
# Apigee environment name
- name: ENV_NAME >
components:
# Environment-specific scaling override
# Otherwise, uses scaling defined at the respective root component
runtime:
replicaCountMin: 2
replicaCountMax: 20
Metrics-based scaling
With metrics-based scaling, the runtime can use CPU and application metrics to scale the apigee-runtime pods.
The Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) API ,
uses the hpaBehavior field to configure the scale-up and scale-down behaviors of the target service.
Metrics-based scaling is not available for any other components in a hybrid deployment.
Note: The behavior and meaning of each of the individual fields in the
YAML examples in this section are not unique to Apigee hybrid. These
concepts come directly from
Kubernetes scaling policies .
Note : An internal connection between Prometheus and the Prometheus-Adapter on port 6443 must be open in order
to receive metrics data and enable scaling. For more information on required ports, see Internal connections .
Scaling can be adjusted based on the following metrics:
Metric
Measure
Considerations
serverMainTaskWaitTime
Average wait time (in ms) of processing queue in runtime instances for proxy requests to process policies.
This metric measures the impact of complexity in the policies attached to the proxy request flow.
serverNioTaskWaitTime
Average wait time (in ms) of processing queue in runtime instances for proxy requests at the http layer.
This metric measures the impact of the number and payload size of proxy requests and responses.
The following example from the runtime stanza in the overrides.yaml
illustrates the standard parameters (and permitted ranges) for scaling apigee-runtime pods in a hybrid implementation:
runtime:
# the following parameters configure metrics-based scaling
hpaMetrics:
serverMainTaskWaitTime: 400M # (range: 300M to 450M)
serverNioTaskWaitTime: 400M # (range: 300M to 450M)
targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 75
hpaBehavior:
scaleDown:
percent:
periodSeconds: 60 # (range: 30 - 180)
value: 20 # (range: 5 - 50)
pods:
periodSeconds: 60 # (range: 30 - 180)
value: 2 # (range: 1 - 15)
selectPolicy: Min
stabilizationWindowSeconds: 120 # (range: 60 - 300)
scaleUp:
percent:
periodSeconds: 60 # (range: 30 - 120)
value: 20 # (range: 5 - 100)
pods:
periodSeconds: 60 # (range: 30 - 120)
value: 4 # (range: 2 - 15)
selectPolicy: Max
stabilizationWindowSeconds: 30 # (range: 30 - 120)
Apply these settings by updating the apigee-runtime chart for each environment. For example:
helm upgrade $ENV_RELEASE_NAME apigee-runtime/ \
--namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \
--atomic \
--set env= $ENV_NAME \
-f overrides .yaml
Enable or disable metrics-based scaling
Metrics-based scaling is enabled by default. You can enable or disable metrics-based scaling by setting the customAutoscaling.enabled property to true or false . Apply changes to the customAutoscaling.enabled property by updating the apigee-telemetry chart. For example:
helm upgrade telemetry apigee-telemetry/ \
--namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \
--atomic \
-f overrides .yaml
Configure more aggressive scaling
Increasing the percent and pods values of the scale-up policy will result in a more aggressive
scale-up policy. Similarly, increasing the percent and pods values in scaleDown
will result in an aggressive scale-down policy. For example:
runtime:
# ...
hpaMetrics:
serverMainTaskWaitTime: 400M
serverNioTaskWaitTime: 400M
targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 75
hpaBehavior:
scaleDown:
percent:
periodSeconds: 60
value: 20
pods:
periodSeconds: 60
value: 4
selectPolicy: Min
stabilizationWindowSeconds: 120
scaleUp:
percent:
periodSeconds: 60
value: 30
pods:
periodSeconds: 60
value: 5
selectPolicy: Max
stabilizationWindowSeconds: 30
In the above example, the scaleDown.pods.value is increased to 5 , the scaleUp.percent.value
is increased to 30 , and the scaleUp.pods.value is increased to 5 .
Note : The value of periodSeconds should not go below 30.
Configure less aggressive scaling
The hpaBehavior configuration values can also be decreased to implement less aggressive scale-up and scale-down policies. For example:
runtime:
# ...
hpaMetrics:
serverMainTaskWaitTime: 400M
serverNioTaskWaitTime: 400M
targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 75
hpaBehavior:
scaleDown:
percent:
periodSeconds: 60
value: 10
pods:
periodSeconds: 60
value: 1
selectPolicy: Min
stabilizationWindowSeconds: 180
scaleUp:
percent:
periodSeconds: 60
value: 20
pods:
periodSeconds: 60
value: 4
selectPolicy: Max
stabilizationWindowSeconds: 30
In the above example, the scaleDown.percent.value is decreased to 10 , the scaleDown.pods.value
is decreased to 1 , and the scaleUp.stablizationWindowSeconds is increased to 180 .
For more information about metrics-based scaling using the hpaBehavior field, see
Scaling policies .
Troubleshooting
This section describes troubleshooting methods for common errors you may encounter while configuring scaling and auto-scaling.
HPA shows unknown for metrics values
If metrics-based scaling does not work and the HPA shows unknown
for metrics values, use the following command to check the HPA output:
kubectl describe hpa HPA_NAME
When running the command, replace HPA_NAME with the name of the HPA you wish to view.
The output will show the CPU target and utilization of the service, indicating that CPU scaling will work
in the absence of metrics-based scaling. For HPA behavior using multiple
parameters, see Scaling on multiple metrics .
