What is a Java Callout?
Apigee provides a range of policies that address common API management requirements such
as security, data transformation, traffic management, and others.
However, there are some cases where your API requires custom behavior that is not implemented
in a standard policy. In these cases, Apigee provides several options that enable you to script
or code customized API behavior. One approach is to implement the desired behavior in Java.
Supported Java versions include: Oracle JDK 11 and OpenJDK 11.
Note: Important: If you are developing JavaCallout
policies, you need to know which permission policies are in effect in the Apigee JVM and how they
will affect your code. See Java
permission reference . .
How do I use Java code in a proxy?
The JavaCallout policy lets you call Java code from within an executing proxy flow. Your Java
code needs to implement certain Apigee-specific Java interfaces that allow the code to interact
with the executing proxy. For example, Java methods exist for getting and setting headers, query
parameters, flow variables, and other entities within the current flow context of the proxy.
When should I use the JavaCallout policy?
Let's look at situations where the JavaCallout policy is useful, and situations where you should
consider other approaches.
First, consider
alternative approaches
Before using the JavaCallout policy, note that there may be alternative approaches that you can use
instead. For example:
For lightweight operations, such as HTTP API calls to remote services, consider using the
ServiceCallout policy. See Service Callout policy .
For relatively simple interactions with message content, such as modifying or extracting
HTTP headers, parameters, or message content, you can use
JavaScript or
PythonScript policies.
What you can do in Java code
The JavaCallout policy supports these basic operations:
Examining or manipulating request or response messages
Getting and setting flow variables. You can use Java methods to access Apigee flow variables.
If you want to access Key Value Map (KVM) information, use a KVM policy,
assign KVM values to flow variables, and then you can access the flow variables from
within the JavaCallout policy.
Calling external services
Raising faults
Manipulating error messages and status codes
What you cannot do in Java
code
Most system calls are disallowed. You cannot :
Make internal file system reads or writes. This means that you cannot use any of the
Java packages to read/write into internal file systems; however, you can make external
remote calls.
Get information about the current process, the process list, or CPU/memory utilization on
the machine.
Access the source code in expressions-1.0.0.jar and message-flow-1.0.0.jar .
Although some such calls may work, they are unsupported and liable to be actively disabled at
any time. Avoid making such calls in your code.
Do not use or rely on Java libraries that are included with Apigee. Those libraries are
for Apigee product functionality only, and there's no guarantee that a library will be available
from release to release. If you use such libraries, use them in non-production demonstrations
only.
Hello JavaCallout
Let's go through a basic hello world a JavaCallout policy example. In this example, we create a
simple proxy with JavaCallout that returns a "hello world" response. The proxy can return one
of two possible responses:
If you pass in a "username" header with a "name" value, the proxy returns:
Hello , < name > !
If you omit the header, the proxy just returns:
"Hello, Guest!"
Download the starter project
To make things simple, we have a basic project prepared for you on GitHub in the Apigee
api-platform-samples repository.
Download or clone api-platform-samples to your system. If you
already have api-platform-samples on your system, do a pull to make sure
you have the latest version.
In a terminal or code editor of your choice, go to the
api-platform-samples/doc-samples/java-hello project.
Write the Java code
Open the Java source file: java-hello/callout/src/main/java/HelloJava.java .
This file is a skeleton version of the main Java class that we will implement. The imported
packages are required for Apigee JavaCallout code. These classes provide methods that allow you
to access the proxy execution context. We'll walk through the steps for compiling and deploying
this code shortly.
package com.apigeesample ;
import com.apigee.flow.execution.ExecutionContext ;
import com.apigee.flow.execution.ExecutionResult ;
import com.apigee.flow.execution.spi.Execution ;
import com.apigee.flow.message.MessageContext ;
public class HelloJava implements Execution {
public ExecutionResult execute ( MessageContext messageContext , ExecutionContext executionContext ) {
try {
// Your code here.
return ExecutionResult . SUCCESS ;
} catch ( Exception e ) {
return ExecutionResult . ABORT ;
}
}
}
Replace the commented line // Your code here with the following code:
String name = messageContext . getMessage (). getHeader ( "username" );
if ( name != null && name . length () > 0 ) {
messageContext . getMessage (). setContent ( "Hello, " + name + "!" );
messageContext . getMessage (). removeHeader ( "username" );
} else {
messageContext . getMessage (). setContent ( "Hello, Guest!" );
}
Note: Note: The MessageContext
object lets you access entities inside the flow where the JavaCallout policy executes. Let's
say the JavaCallout policy is attached to the Proxy Endpoint Response flow. The code listed
above gets the HTTP Message object for that flow context. The Message
object, in turn, gives you access to headers, query parameters, body content, and flow
variables.
Save the file.
Compile your code with Maven
Note: The POM file and configuration for the Maven compile should
work, but are offered in the Git repository as an example only. You may need to make adjustments
for your environment. If you make changes to the sample code, you may also need to adjust the
Maven configuration.
Be sure that you have Maven installed:
mvn - version
Install the required JAR dependencies in your local Maven repo using one of the following methods:
Add the following snippet to the pom.xml file to downoad the required JAR dependencies from
Artifact Registry :
<repositories>
<repository>
<id>artifact-registry</id>
<url>https://us-maven.pkg.dev/apigee-release/apigee-java-callout-dependencies</url>
</repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.apigee.gateway.libraries</groupId>
<artifactId>message-flow</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0</version>
<scope>compile</scope>
<type>jar</type>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.apigee.infra.libraries</groupId>
<artifactId>expressions</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0</version>
<scope>compile</scope>
<type>jar</type>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
Use the following curl calls to download the required JAR dependencies from
Artifact Registry :
curl "https://us-maven.pkg.dev/apigee-release/apigee-java-callout-dependencies/com/apigee/gateway/libraries/message-flow/1.0.0/message-flow-1.0.0.jar" - v - L - o message - flow - 1.0 - 0. jar
curl "https://us-maven.pkg.dev/apigee-release/apigee-java-callout-dependencies/com/apigee/infra/libraries/expressions/1.0.0/expressions-1.0.0.jar" - v - L - o expressions - 1.0.0 . jar
Execute the script java-hello/buildsetup.sh . This script downloads the required JAR
dependencies from the Apigee GitHub repository .
cd to the java-hello/callout directory.
Execute Maven:
mvn clean package
Note: If you get a Maven error, be sure that you are in the
java-hello/callout directory.
If you wish, verify that the JAR file edge-custom-policy-java-hello.jar was
copied to java-hello/apiproxy/resources/java . This is the required location for
JAR files that you wish to deploy with a proxy.
Deploy and call the proxy
Follow these steps to deploy and test the API proxy:
Change to the java-hello directory.
Zip the API proxy bundle:
zip apiproxy - bundle . zip - r apiproxy - x \ * . \ *~
The simplest way to deploy the proxy is to bundle it in a zip file and upload the proxy
bundle to an environment in your Apigee organization. See Creating an API proxy .
Be sure to use the Upload Proxy Bundle option. See also
Tips and tricks for uploading API proxy in a proxy bundle in the Apigee community.
When the proxy is deployed, try calling it:
curl https : //$HOSTNAME/java-hello -H "username:Will"
Which returns "Hello, Will!
About the proxy
Let's quickly examine the policies used in this proxy. Pay attention to where the policies are
positioned in the proxy flow and why.
The Assign message policy
An Assign message policy is attached to the ProxyEndpoint request flow . It
copies the username header from the request and assigns it to the response. This operation allows
the JavaCallout policy, which is attached to the response flow, to access the username header
and build a custom response body using the value of that header.
< AssignMessage async = "false" continueOnError = "false" enabled = "true" name = "CopyHeader" >
< DisplayName>CopyHeader < / DisplayName >
< Copy source = "request" >
< Headers >
< Header name = "username" / >
< / Headers >
< / Copy >
< IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true < / IgnoreUnresolvedVariables >
< AssignTo createNew = "false" transport = "http" type = "response" / >
< / AssignMessage >
The JavaCallout policy
The JavaCallout policy is attached to the response flow . This is because the
custom Java code makes changes to the response headers and message. The policy's ClassName
element specifies the main class that is executed by the policy. The ResourceURL element is the
name of the JAR file that you built and added to the resources/java directory of the
proxy.
< JavaCallout name = "hello-java" >
< ClassName>com . apigeesample . HelloJava < / ClassName >
< ResourceURL>java : //edge-custom-policy-java-hello.jar</ResourceURL>
< / JavaCallout >
What you need to know about the JavaCallout policy
Important things to note about implementing the JavaCallout policy are:
Imports classes from the com.apigee.flow.execution and
com.apigee.flow.message packages. These packages must be included in the JAR file
that is packaged and deployed. You can upload your Java JAR through the Management UI proxy
editor, or you can include it in the /resources/java directory in API proxies that
you develop locally.
Implements the Execution interface. Any Java code that is executed within an API proxy must
implement Execution.
JavaCallout policy contains no actual code. Instead, the policy references a
Java 'resource', which you must package in a JAR.
Package names to avoid: Do not use io.apigee or
com.apigee as package names in JavaCallout policies. Those are reserved and used by
other Apigee modules.
If your JavaCallout policy relies on additional third-party libraries packaged as independent JAR
files, then place those JAR files in the /resources/java directory as well to
ensure that they are loaded correctly at runtime.
If there are multiple JARs, simply add them as additional resources. You do not need to
modify the policy configuration to refer to additional JAR files. Putting them in
/resources/java is sufficient.
For additional information on uploading Java JARs, see Resource files .
