Customize migration plan for WebSphere workloads
Before you begin
This document assumes that you've already
created a migration
and have the migration plan file.
Edit the migration plan
After you have copied the file system and analyzed it, you can find the
migration plan in the new directory that is created in the specified output
path: ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH / config.yaml .
Edit the migration plan as necessary and save the changes.
Review your migration plan details and guiding comments to add information as
needed.
Specifically, consider edits around the following sections.
Migration plan structure
The migration plan for WebSphere workloads has the following structure,
which you can customize as described in the following sections.

port : 9443
protocol : TCP
# Specify whether discovered keystores are automatically converted to
# Kubernetes secrets. Defaults to true.
enableSecrets : true
Exclude applications
To exclude applications from the migration, remove them from the applications list.
applications:
# Exclude app1.war:
# - path: app1.war
# ...
- path: app2.war
Control application files
To control which application files are included or excluded from the migration,
update the configurations and resources fields.
applications:
- path: app.war
resources:
keystores:
# Exclude key1.p12:
# - key1.p12
# Include key2.p12:
- key2.p12
additionalResources:
# Exclude resource1.xml:
# - resource1.xml
# Include resource2.xml:
- resource2.xml
Customize the target Java runtime
To customize the target Java runtime for the application, update the targetJavaRuntime field.
applications :
- path : app . war
targetJavaRuntime :
se : SE
ee : EE
vendor : VENDOR
Replace the following:
SE : the Java SE version. Format: [SE8|SE11|SE17].
EE : the Java EE or Jakarta EE version. Format: [EE7|EE8|EE9|EE10].
VENDOR : the Java vendor. Format: [IBM Corporation|Oracle Corporation].
Customize the target application server
To customize the target application server for the application, update the targetApplicationServer field.
applications:
- path: app.war
targetApplicationServer:
profile: PROFILE
version: VERSION
edition: EDITION
Replace the following:
PROFILE : the WebSphere profile. Format: [Liberty|Traditional].
TARGET_VERSION : the WebSphere version.
TARGET_EDITION : the WebSphere edition. Format: [Base|Core|Open|ND].
Customize the target container
To customize the target container to be used for the application, update the targetContainer field.
applications:
- path: app.war
targetContainer:
baseImage: BASE_IMAGE
home: HOME
server: SERVER
user: USER
group: GROUP
Customize Kubernetes secrets
By default, files listed under the keystores field are migrated to Kubernetes
secrets. To migrate these files as is, you can disable this feature.
applications:
- path: app.war
resources:
keystores:
- key.p12
targetContainer:
# Do not migrate keystores to Kubernetes secrets:
enableSecrets: false
Customize Kubernetes ports
To control which ports are exposed by Kubernetes Pods and Services, update the ports field.
applications:
- path: app.war
targetContainer:
ports:
# Exclude http-tcp-9080:
# - name: http-tcp-9080
# port: 9080
# protocol: TCP
# Include https-tcp-9443:
- name: https-tcp-9443
port: 9443
