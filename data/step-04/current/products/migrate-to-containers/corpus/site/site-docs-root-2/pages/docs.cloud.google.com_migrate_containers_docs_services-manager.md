New enhanced runtime
The original Linux service manager for Migrate to Containers relied
on sysv init and systemd . The simplified Linux service manager
replaces it with a simplified, container friendly alternative.
This simplified Linux service manager adds functionality that lets you deploy
your migrated container workloads to:
GKE Autopilot clusters
Cloud Run
The simplified Linux service manager also resolves compatibility issues with Kubernetes plugins.
For example, the simplified Linux service manager removes the requirement of defining a hostpath
for /sys/fs/cgroup in the deployment_spec.yaml file and the need to create
privileged containers.
Before you begin
Migrate to Containers supplies a tool that you run on a VM workload to determine
the fit of the workload for migration to a container. For more information, see Using the fit assessment tool .
About GKE Autopilot clusters
Autopilot is a mode of operation in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Autopilot is designed to
reduce the operational cost of managing clusters, optimize your clusters for production,
and yield higher workload availability. In Autopilot mode, GKE
provisions and manages the underlying infrastructure of the cluster, including nodes and
node pools, giving you an optimized cluster with an automated experience.
Note: Autopilot is supported for GKE clusters but is not
supported for GKE Enterprise clusters.
See Autopilot overview for more details.
About Cloud Run
Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables you to
run stateless containers that are invokable by web requests or Pub/Sub events.
The simplified Linux service manager lets you deploy your migrated container workloads on Cloud Run.
Note: The container workload must be stateless to be deployed on Cloud Run.
See Developing your service for more information,
including the complete list of requirements for deploying containers on Cloud Run.
Using workload identity with Migrate to Containers and GKE
Migrate to Containers and GKE let you deploy your
migrated workloads to Google Distributed Cloud .
Sometimes, you might use the same cluster as both the processing cluster and the deployment cluster.
If you have enabled workload identity on your deployment cluster, ensure that you configure your deployment environment to support Migrate to Containers and GKE.
Also, you must ensure that any services started as part of the init
process are configured correctly for workload identity. The steps you perform depend on
the service manager for your cluster.
See Deploying a Linux workload to a target cluster
for the configuration steps.
Changes from the existing runtime
To use the simplified Linux service manager, you should be aware of the following
changes and limitations from the existing runtime.
New services-config.yaml artifact file added
If you enable the simplified Linux service manager, Migrate to Containers creates a new artifact file,
services-config.yaml , when you generate the migration artifacts. Use this file to control
application initialization on a deployed container. See Using services-config.yaml
for more information.
Note: The services-config.yaml is only created when you perform a new migration
using Migrate to Containers version 1.15.0. It is not created
when you convert an existing migration from a previous version to version 1.15.0.
Readiness probes
When using the current runtime, Migrate to Containers adds a readiness probe in
the deployment_spec.yaml file. When you enable the simplified Linux service manager,
no readiness probe is added.
If you want to add a readiness probe, we recommend that you use an HTTP readiness probe.
See Define readiness probes
for more information.
Note: You can add the simplified Linux service manager readiness probe to your Service definition:
readinessProbe:
exec:
command:
- /.m4a/gamma status
However, this probe might return a false negative result.
syslog support
The simplified Linux service manager creates a Unix socket at /dev/log to support the syslog.
The simplified Linux service manager forwards these log messages to stdout so that they are
recorded by Kubernetes as container logs.
Limitations
You should be aware of the following limitations when using the simplified
Linux service manager.
Workload limitations
The simplified Linux service manager works best with the following types of workloads:
Image
Operating system
Services
Compute Engine Ubuntu 12.04
Ubuntu 12.04
apache2
Compute Engine Ubuntu 14.04
Ubuntu 14.04

Compute Engine Marketplace Erpnext
Debian 10.9
nginx, redis-server, supervisor, mariadb
Compute Engine Marketplace wildfly
Debian 10.10
wildfly, cron
systemd limitations
If you're using systemd as your init system, be aware of the following limitations:
systemd service types
of simple , exec , and notify are treated as exec service. That means the
service is considered started, when exec succeeds.
Notify sockets are supported for
sd_notify()
for READY=1 messages only.
If needed, you can provide other readiness checks. For example, HTTP check
or other types of check.
Socket type unit files are not supported. Sockets are not created and no environment variables are created.
Updates for version 1.9.0
The simplified Linux service manager for version 1.9.0 contains the following updates:
The Linux service manager has been released for general availability, and is no longer
in Public Preview.
The procedure to Convert existing container workloads to support Autopilot
has been changed. You now need to edit both the Dockerfile and the
deployment_spec.yaml file for an existing migration to convert it.
The config.yaml file has been renamed to services-config.yaml .
Updates for version 1.8.1
The simplified Linux service manager was originally released in Public Preview as part of
Migrate to Containers version 1.8. The simplified Linux service manager for version 1.8.1
contains the following updates:
You no longer set an annotation in the migration plan to enable the simplified
Linux service manager. Instead, you now set v2kServiceManager .
See Deploy containers to Autopilot clusters
for more.
The environment variable HC_GAMMA_RUNTIME has been renamed to HC_V2K_SERVICE_MANAGER .
The prestart and poststart entries in the services-config.yaml file now automatically populated.
See Using services-config.yaml
for more.
Added support to the services-config.yaml file that lets you specify environment variables
at the global level or at the application level.
See Using services-config.yaml
for more.
Added logging support that lets you customize log data written to Cloud Logging.
See Customize log data written to Cloud Logging
for more.
