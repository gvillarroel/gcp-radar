Using services-config.yaml
When you use the simplified Linux service manager to perform a migration, Migrate to Containers
creates a new artifact file, services-config.yaml .
Use this file to control application initialization on a deployed container.
Note: The services-config.yaml is only created when you perform a new migration
using Migrate to Containers version 1.15.0. It is not created
when you convert an existing migration from a previous version to version 1.15.0.
For example, after you migrate the container, edit the services-config.yaml file to control
application initialization to:
Remove applications from the file
Add applications to the file
Edit the initialization properties of an application
Shown below is an example services-config.yaml file:
version : v1beta1
env :
- name : KEY1
value : VALUE1
- name : KEY2
value : VALUE2
applications :
- name : nginx
type : forking
envfile : /path/to/file.txt
env :

In this file:
env : Specifies environment variables at the global level or at the application level.
If you specify the same environment variable at both the global and application levels,
then the environment variable at the application level takes precedence.
For environment variables set at the global level, use env to specify a name / value pair.
Names can contain ASCII letters, digits, and the underscore character.
Names cannot start with a digit.
For environment variables set at the application level, use env to specify a name / value pair.
Or, use envfile to specify the path to a text file containing lines in the form:
# Comments allowed
KEY = VALUE
If the text file contains an environment variable definition that duplicates one
specified by env , then the one specified by env takes precedence.
applications : Specifies the list of applications to be started when you
deploy the container and sets the application's initialization properties.
name : Specifies the name of the application.
type specifies the type of the application, as one of the following:
forking : Run the file specified by start without forking.
The service executable is expected to fork. We recommend that you also set pidfile .
exec : Fork to run the service. The service is considered started after exec
has been called on the executable.
simple - Same as exec . A simple service behaves differently from
the systemd definition because it waits for both fork and exec instead of for fork .
notify : Same as exec except that for systemd the NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variable
is not set so sd_notify systemd calls do not work.
oneshot : The service is considered started after exec is called on the executable.
The status is error if the service exits with an error code not equal to 0.
prestart , start , poststart , and status commands for the service.
To start a service, Migrate to Containers executes the prestart commands (if any),
then the start command, and finally the poststart commands (if any). If a
command fails, and you have not configured the command to use ignore_errors ,
then the service is stopped and you see an error message in the service's status.
The commands used to perform specific operations on the application have the form:
command-type :
cmd : command
shell : /bin/sh
ignore_errors : false
ignore_environment_variables : false
Where:
command-type : Specifies the command type as either prestart ,
start , poststart , or status .
For start , you can have a single command unless the type is oneshot .
If type=forking or type=oneshot , the poststart commands are
executed after the start command forks. Otherwise, they are executed
immediately after executing the start command.
command : Specifies the command to run to perform the operation.
Note: Not everything supported by /bin/sh is supported.
Only basic environment substitution is supported.
shell (Optional): By default, all commands are executed
in the /bin/sh shell. You can optionally set shell to /bin/bash .
ignore_errors (Optional): If true , an exit code
from the command normally considered a failure is recorded, but the command
is considered to have succeeded. The default value is false .
By default, Migrate to Containers sets ignore_errors to true for any
systemd executable that includes the "-" prefix.
ignore_environment_variables (Optional): If true ,
environment variable substitution is not applied.
The default value is false .
By default, Migrate to Containers sets ignore_environment_variables to true
for any systemd executable that includes the ":" prefix.
pidfile : Specifies the pid file containing the process ID of
the service which is used to check if the process is still running.
chdir : Specifies the working directory of the started process.
user : Specifies the user name under which the new process is started.
group : Specifies the group name under which the new process is started.
timers : Specifies the list of timers of the application. The
application will be activated whenever any of the specified timers
elapse.
version : v1beta1
env : []
Applications :
- name : service_name
type : service_type
start :
- cmd : service_exec_command
timers :
- name : timer_name
on_calendar :
- cron : realtime_time
on_startup :
- duration : monotonic_time
on_service_start :
- duration : monotonic_time
on_service_stop :
- duration : monotonic_time
name : Specifies the name of the timer.
on_calendar : Specifies the list of calendar events for the
timer.
cron : A specified time using cron format. For example:
cron : 0 0 * * *
cron : @ daily
on_startup : Specifies a list of durations (relative to
when you deploy your container).
duration : A specified time using duration format. For example:
duration : 30m
duration : 1sec
on_service_start : Specifies a list of durations, relative to
when your application's status changes to active.
duration : A specified time using duration format.
on_service_stop : Specifies a list of durations, relative to
when your application's status changes to inactive.
duration : A specified time using duration format.
Use the following properties to specify paths to directories that are created
before starting the service:
runtime_directories : Specifies the list of paths to directories
created in /run/ .
state_directories : Specifies the list of paths to directories
created in /var/lib/ .
cache_directories : Specifies the list of paths to directories
created in /var/cache/ .
logs_directories : Specifies the list of paths to directories
created in /var/log/ .
configuration_directories : Specifies the list of paths to directories
created in /etc/ .
Each of these properties takes the following options:
mode : Specifies the file mode. The default is 0755, corresponding
to read and execute access for everyone, and write access for the owner.
preserve : If false the directory is cleaned up when the service is stopped.
The default is true .
Add or remove a service to your services.yaml file
You can add or remove a service from your services.yaml file by manually
editing it. Whenever you add a new service, you must populate the following
fields:
name
type
start
For more information about the mandatory and optional fields for a service, see
the services.yaml definition above.
Note: When working with .yaml documents, you should be mindful about your
indentation and spacing as they can cause warnings and errors.
Add a service
To add a service to your services.yaml file, follow these steps:
Open your services.yaml file in a text editor for modification.
In services.yaml , navigate to the applications attribute:
version : v1beta1
env :
- name : KEY1
...
applications :
Add your desired service on the line below the applications attribute
starting with the name field, followed by the other mandatory and optional
fields appropriate to your application:
version : v1beta1
env :
- name : KEY1
...
applications :
- name :
type :
start :
- cmd :
...
If your services.yaml file already has service definitions under the
applications attribute, you can add a new service starting with the
name field on the line below the last entry of the previous service:
version : v1beta1
env :
- name : KEY1
...
applications :
- name :
type :
start :
- name :
type :
start :
...
Save your services.yaml file.
Remove a service
To remove a service from your services.yaml file, follow these steps:
Open your services.yaml file in a text editor for modification.
In services.yaml , navigate to the applications attribute:
version : v1beta1
env :
- name : KEY1
...
applications :
...
Remove your desired service starting with the name field, followed by
the other mandatory and optional fields appropriate to your application.
For example:
Before the service has been removed:
version : v1beta1
env :
- name : KEY1
...
applications :
- name :
type :
start :
- cmd :
- name :
...
After the service has been removed:
version : v1beta1
env :
- name : KEY1
...
applications :
- name :
...
Save your services.yaml file.
