Review compatible OS, workloads, and Kubernetes versions
This document lists operating systems, supported workloads, and Kubernetes versions
that have been tested with Migrate to Containers CLI.
To learn how to determine a virtual machine (VM) instance workload's fit for
migration to a container, see
Offline assessment overview .
Supported workloads
Migrate to Containers CLI supports modernization of workloads listed in the following
table:
Workload Type (if applicable) Supported versions
Linux VM container VMs running 64-bit Linux-based operating systems
Linux-based workloads Tomcat Apache Tomcat version 8.5 - 10.0
Apache Apache HTTP Server version 2.4
JBoss WildFly (formerly known as JBoss Application Server) version 8.1.0 - 26.1.1
JBoss Enterprise Application Platform version 7.0 - 7.4
WebSphere WebSphere Application Server traditional version 8.55 and 9.05
All versions of WebSphere Application Server Liberty
WordPress sites WordPress version 4.0 or later running on Apache HTTP Server version 2.4
Windows IIS application Microsoft Internet Information Services version 7 or later
Note: For workloads that use a Java-based plugin, Migrate to Containers CLI only supports
Java SE version 8 or later. If your workload relies on an earlier version of
Java, then you need to create a custom Docker image
to execute the migration.

Linux-based workloads
For Linux-based workloads, Migrate to Containers CLI supports all Linux-based operating
systems.
Windows IIS application
Migrate to Containers CLI supports the Windows operating systems listed in the following table:
OS
Compute Engine
Windows
Microsoft Windows Server 2008R2 or later
ASP.NET and .NET Framework version 3.5 or later
Warning: Dynamic disks have been deprecated
by Microsoft, and have severe limitations with snapshots. Use caution
when using these, especially in tandem with using snapshots for backup purposes.
Local machine operating system
Linux local machine
Migrate to Containers CLI supports migrations using local machines with all 64-bit
Linux operating systems.
Windows local machine
Migrate to Containers CLI supports migrations using local machines with 64-bit Windows
Server 2019 LTSC operating systems.
Local machine storage
The local machine must have several GB of free storage available to create a
copy of the source machine file system. The free storage required on you local
machine depends on the size of the source machine file system that you want to
copy and on the filters that you apply.
Note: It is recommended to avoid running the Migrate to Containers CLI in
Cloud Shell where the provisioned disk has only 5 GB of storage.
Workload cluster operating systems
Linux VM container
For Linux VM containers, Migrate to Containers CLI supports all versions of Ubuntu-based
nodes.
Linux-based workloads
For Linux-based workloads, Migrate to Containers CLI supports all versions of Linux-based
nodes.
Windows IIS application
For Windows IIS applications, Migrate to Containers CLI supports all versions of
Windows-based nodes.
Note: If you build the container image locally, then the resulting container
runs only on nodes with the same operating system as the machine where you
build the container image. However, if you're using Cloud Build to
build the container image, then the resulting container runs on any
Windows-based node.
