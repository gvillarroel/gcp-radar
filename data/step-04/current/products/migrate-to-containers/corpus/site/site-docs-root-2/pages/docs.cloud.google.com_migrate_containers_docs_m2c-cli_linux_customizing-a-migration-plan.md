Customize migration plan for Linux VMs
Before executing a migration plan, you should review and optionally customize it.
The details of your migration plan are used to extract the workload's container
artifacts from the source VM, and also to generate Kubernetes deployment files
that you can use to deploy the container image to other clusters, such as a
production cluster.
This page describes the migration plan's contents and the kinds of
customizations you might consider before you execute the migration and generate
deployment artifacts.
Before you begin
This topic assumes that you've already created a migration plan
and have the resulting migration plan file.
Edit the migration plan
After you have copied the file system and analyzed it, you can find the
migration plan in the new directory that is created in the specified output
path: ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH / config.yaml .
Edit the migration plan as necessary and save the changes.
Review your migration plan details and guiding comments to add information
as needed.
Specifically, consider edits around the following sections.
Specify content to exclude from the migration
By default, Migrate to Containers excludes typical VM content that isn't
relevant in the context of GKE. You can customize that filter.
The filters field value lists paths that should be excluded from migration
and will not be part of the container image.
The field's value lists rsync filter rules that specify which files to transfer
and which to skip. Preceding each path and file with a minus sign specifies that
the item in the list should be excluded from migration. The list is processed
according to the order of lines in the YAML, and exclusions/inclusions are
evaluated accordingly.
Learn more about
rsync filter rules .
Files that are too large to be included in the Docker image are listed
in the YAML file.
This will flag files that are larger than 1 GB for your consideration.
Docker images that are too large, or greater than 15 GB, are at risk
of failure during migration.
You can edit the YAML list to add or remove paths. See an example YAML below,
which includes example exclusions, as well as notifications for large
and sparse files. Follow the inline guidance to perform one of the following
actions:
Exclude the detected folders by uncommenting them and placing them under the
global filters section.
Move the detected folders to to a persistent volume by uncommenting them and
placing them under the data folder section.
You can also exclude or move the detected sparse files in the same manner.
global :
# Files and directories to exclude from the migration, in rsync format.
filters :
- "- *.swp"
- "- /etc/fstab"
- "- /boot/"
- "- /tmp/*"
- "- /var/log/*.log*"
- "- /var/log/*/*.log*"
- "- /var/cache/*"
## The data folders below are too large to be included in the docker image.
## Consider uncommenting and placing them under either the global filters
## or the data folder section.
# - '- /a' # (1.8GB, last access 2022-02-02 10:50:30, last modified 2020-02-02 10:50:30)
# - '- /a/c' # (1.8GB, last access 2022-02-02 10:50:30, last modified 2020-02-02 10:50:30)
## Sparse files will fail the run of a docker image. Consider excluding the below
## detected files and any other sparse files by uncommenting and placing them in
## the global filters section, or export them to a persistent volume by specifying
## them in the data folder section.
# - '- /a/b' # (1.8GB, last access 2022-02-02 10:50:30, last modified 2020-02-02 10:50:30)
# - '- /a/d' # (1.8GB, last access 2022-02-02 10:50:30, last modified 2020-02-02 10:50:30)
Set the name of the container image
The name field value in the image section defines the name of the image
created from a migrated VM that is used for the container. You can change this
value if you prefer to use a different name.
image:
# Review and set the name for runnable container image.
name: linux-system
Customize the services list
By default, Migrate to Containers disables unneeded services
on a VM when you migrate it to a container. These services can sometimes cause
issues with the migrated container, or are not needed in a container context.
Along with the services automatically disabled by Migrate to Containers, you can
optionally disable other services:
Migrate to Containers automatically discovers services that you can optionally
disable and lists them in the migration plan. These services, such as ssh
or a web server, might not be required in your migrated workload but it is
up to you to make that decision. If necessary, edit the migration plan to disable these services.
Migrate to Containers does not list all services running on the source VM.
For example, it omits operating-system related services. You can optionally
edit the migration plan to add your own list of services to disable in the migrated container.
The systemServices field specifies the list of services discovered by Migrate to Containers.
For example:
systemServices :
- enabled : true|false
name : service-name
probed : true|false
- enabled : true|false
name : service-name
probed : true|false
...
To disable a service, set enabled to false .
Migrate to Containers does not list all services running on the source VM, such as
operating-system related services. You can also add additional services to the list.
For example, to disable service2 and the cron service:
systemServices :
- enabled : true
name : service1
probed : false
- enabled : false
name : service2
probed : false
- enabled : false
name : cron
probed : false
When you execute a migration to generate
the migration artifacts, Migrate to Containers creates the blocklist.yaml file.
This file lists the container services to disable based on your settings in the migration plan.
For example:
service_list :
- name : disabled-services
services :
# Because you used systemServices above to disabled service2 and cron:
- service2
- cron
To later modify the list of disabled services:
Edit the list of services in the migration plan.
Execute the migration
to regenerate the migration artifacts, including an updated blocklist.yaml .
Alternatively, after you execute a migration to generate the migration
artifacts, you can edit the blocklist.yaml file directly, and then build
and deploy the container image using Skaffold .
Customize service endpoints
The migration plan includes the endpoints array that defines
the ports and protocols used to create the Kubernetes Services provided by the migrated workload.
You can add, edit, or delete endpoint definitions to customize the migration plan.
To retrieve the endpoints ports, check the programs that are listening ports:
sudo netstat --programs --listening --tcp --udp [--sctp]
For each Service endpoint, add the following definition
to the migration plan:
endpoints :
- port : PORT_NUMBER
protocol : PORT_PROTOCOL
name : PORT_NAME
Where:
PORT_NUMBER specifies the container port number to which requests to
the service are routed.
PORT_PROTOCOL specifies the port protocol, such as HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP.
See Supported protocols
for the complete list of protocols.
PORT_NAME specifies the name used to access the Service endpoint.
Migrate to Containers generates a unique PORT_NAME for each generated endpoint definitions.
For example, Migrate to Containers detects the following endpoints:
endpoints :
- port : 80
protocol : HTTP
name : backend-server-nginx
- port : 6379
protocol : TCP
name : backend-server-redis
To set the value of the name property, Migrate to Containers combines the source VM name,
backend-server in this example, with the program name of the Service.
The generated names are compatible with Kubernetes naming conventions, and are unique
within the migration plan. For example, the migration plan above creates a Service
that targets Nginx on port 80 over HTTP.
For any duplicate names, Migrate to Containers appends a counter suffix. For example,
if Nginx is associated with two ports, it adds the -2 suffix to the name
in the second definition:
endpoints :
- port : 80
protocol : HTTP
name : backend-server-nginx
- port : 8080
protocol : HTTPS
name : backend-server-nginx-2
- port : 6379
protocol : TCP
name : backend-server-redis
When you execute a migration to generate the migration artifacts, Migrate to Containers
creates a Service
definition in the deployment_spec.yaml file for each endpoint.
For example, shown below is a Service definition in the deployment_spec.yaml file:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
creationTimestamp : null
name : backend-server-nginx
spec :
ports :
- port : 80
protocol : HTTP
targetPort : 80
selector :
app : backend-server
status :
loadBalancer : {}
Customize NFS mounts
Migrate to Containers includes NFS mounts in the generated migration plan.
This information is collected from the fstab file and written to the
nfsMounts array in the migration plan. You can add or edit
NFS mount point definitions to customize the migration plan.
Note: The entries in nfsMounts array are disabled by default. You must enable them
if you want Migrate to Containers to generate entries in the
deployment_spec.yaml file for each NFS mount.
When generating the migration plan, Migrate to Containers:
Ignores NFS mounts for /sys and /dev .
Ignores NFS mounts with a type other than nfs or nfs4 .
Each NFS mount in the migration plan includes the server's IP address and local mount path in the form:
nfsMounts :
- mountPoint : MOUNT_POINT
exportedDirectory : DIR_NAME
nfsServer : IP
mountOptions :
- OPTION_1
- OPTION_2
enabled : false|true
Where:
MOUNT_POINT specifies the mount point obtained from fstab .
DIR_NAME specifies the name of the shared directory.
IP specifies the IP address of the server hosting the mount point.
OPTION_N specifies any options extracted from the fstab for the mount point.
For example, for the following entry in fstab :
< file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
10.49.232.26:/vol1 /mnt/test nfs rw,hard 0 0
Migrate to Containers generates the following entry in the migration plan:
nfsMounts :
- mountPoint : /mnt/test
exportedDirectory : /vol1
nfsServer : 10.49.232.26
mountOptions :
- rw
- hard
enabled : false
To configure Migrate to Containers to process entries in the nfsMounts array,
set enabled to true for the mountPoint entry. You can enable one, some,
or all mountPoints entries, edit the entries, or add your own entries.
When you execute a migration to generate the migration artifacts, Migrate to Containers
creates a volumes and volumeMounts
definition and a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim
definition in the deployment_spec.yaml file for each enabled NFS mount.
Note: Migrate to Containers requires that NFS servers be accessible from the
deployment cluster hosting the migrated container workload. However, Migrate to Containers
does not validate that connectivity. A migrated container with a connectivity issue
cannot be started and you might have to edit the deployment_spec.yaml file
to fix the issue. See Access Filestore instances with the Filestore CSI driver
for more information.
For example, shown below is a volumeMounts definition in the deployment_spec.yaml file:
spec :
containers :
- image : gcr.io/myimage-1/image-name
name : some-app
volumeMounts :
- mountPath : /sys/fs/cgroup
name : cgroups
- mountPath : /mnt/test
name : nfs-pv
Where the value of name is a unique identifier generated by Migrate to Containers.
Shown below is an example PersistentVolumeClaim and PersistentVolume definitions
in the deployment_spec.yaml file:
apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolumeClaim
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteOnce
resources :
requests :
storage : 1Mi
storageClassName : ""
volumeName : nfs-pv
apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolume
metadata :
name : nfs-pv
spec :
mountOptions :
- rw
- hard
nfs :
path : /vol1
server : 10.49.232.26
Customize log data written to Cloud Logging
Typically a source VM writes information to one or more log files. As part of migrating
the VM, you can configure the migrated workload to write that log information to
Cloud Logging .
Note: Previous releases of Migrate to Containers supported customizing
logging by using a ConfigMap on your target workload cluster, as described in
Configuring logging to Cloud Logging .
This section describes how to use the logs.yaml file to configure logging.
If the logs.yaml file exists, logging settings defined by a ConfigMap are ignored.
When you generate the migration plan, Migrate to Containers automatically searches
for log destination files on the source VM. Migrate to Containers then writes
information about those detected files to the logPaths area of the migration plan:
deployment :
...
logPaths :
- appName : APP_NAME
globs :
- LOG_PATH
For example:
deployment :
...
logPaths :
- appName : tomcat
globs :
- /var/log/tomcat*/catalina.out
When you generate the migration artifacts, Migrate to Containers generates the
logs.yaml file from the migration plan. This file contains the list of log files
detected on the source VM. For example, from the logsPath definition above,
logs.yaml contains:
logs :
tomcat :
- /var/log/tomcat*/catalina.out
In this example, when you deploy the migrated workload, log information written
to catalina.out is automatically written to Cloud Logging.
Entries each appear on a line in the log in the following form:
DATE TIME APP_NAME LOG_OUTPUT
The following example illustrates the form with an entry from Tomcat:
2019 - 09 - 22 12 : 43 : 08.681193976 + 0000 UTC to mcat log - output
To configure logging, you can either:
Edit the migration plan before you generate the migration artifacts to
add, remove, or edit logPaths entries. When you generate the migration artifacts,
these edits are reflected in the logs.yaml file.
Edit logs.yaml after you generate the migration artifacts to add, remove, or
edit logs entries.
The advantage to editing the migration plan is that your edits are reflected in
logs.yaml every time you generate the artifacts. If you edit logs.yaml directly,
then regenerate the artifacts for some reason, you have to reapply your edits to logs.yaml .
Set Linux v2kServiceManager health probes
You can monitor the downtime and ready status of your managed containers by specifying
probes in your Tomcat web server's migration plan. Health
probe monitoring can help reduce the downtime of migrated containers and provide better monitoring.
Unknown health states can create availability degradation, false-positive availability monitoring,
and potential data loss. Without a health probe, kubelet can only assume the health of a container and may send
traffic to a container instance that is not ready. This can cause traffic loss. Kubelet
may also not detect containers that are in a frozen state and will not restart them.
A health probe functions by running a small scripted statement when the container starts.
The script checks for successful conditions, which are defined by the type of probe
used, every period. The period is defined in the migration plan by a periodSeconds field.
You can run or define these scripts manually.
To learn more about kubelet probes, see Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes in the
Kubernetes documentation.
There are two types of probes available to configure, both probes are probe-v1-core defined in
probe-v1-core reference
and share the same function as the corresponding fields of container-v1-core
Liveness probe - Liveness probes are used to know when to restart a container.
Note: If a process in your container is able to crash on its own when it encounters an issue,
or becomes unhealthy, you do not necessarily need a liveness probe. The kubelet
will automatically perform the correct action in accordance with the Pod's restartPolicy .
Readiness probe - Readiness probes are used to know when a container is
ready to start accepting traffic. To start sending traffic to a Pod only when a
probe succeeds, specify a readiness probe. A readiness probe may act similarly to a liveness probe,
but a readiness probe in the specifications indicates that a Pod will start without
receiving any traffic and only start receiving traffic after the probe succeeds.
After discovery, the probe configuration is added to the migration plan. The probes
can be used in their default configuration as shown below. To disable probes, remove the
probes section from the yaml.
deployment :
probes :
livenessProbe :
exec :
command :
- /ko-app/service-manager-runtime
- /probe
readinessProbe :
exec :
command :
- gamma
- /probe
initialDelaySeconds : 60
periodSeconds : 5
image :
# Disable system services that do not need to be executed at the migrated workload containers.
# Enable the 'probed' property to include system services in the container health checks.
systemServices :
- enabled : true
name : apache2
probed : true
- enabled : true
name : atd
probed : false
By default, all service probing is disabled. You must define which subset of services
will be monitored.
Note: Not all services support probing and may cause a container to
fail to start up.
There are four pre-defined ways to check a container using a probe. Each probe must
define exactly one of these four mechanisms:
exec - Executes a specified command inside the container.
Execution is considered successful if the exit status code is 0.
grpc - Performs a remote procedure call using `gRPC`. `gRPC` probes are an alpha feature.
httpGet - Performs an HTTP GET request against the Pod's IP address on a specified port and path.
The request is considered successful if the status code is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 400.
tcpSocket - Performs a TCP check against the Pod's IP address on a specified port.
The diagnostic is considered successful if the port is open.
By default, a migration plan enables the exec probing method. Use manual
configuration for your migration plan to enable another method.
To add external dependencies for the readiness probe, while using the default
liveness probe, define an exec readiness probe and a script that implements the logic.
