Discover, collect, and assess VMware VMs for migration
Learn how to download the Migration Center discovery client CLI and use it to remotely
discover, collect, and assess virtual machine (VM) instances running on VMware
for migration and containerization.
Note: The mcdc CLI can discover, collect, and assess up
to 10,000 VMs in a single deployment.
You can generate offline assessment reports in a user-friendly HTML format.
These reports display the results for each of the migration targets and outlines
actions to take to eliminate blockers and risks.
Before you begin
Provision a Linux machine to download and run the
mcdc CLI. The Linux machine must have the
following minimum requirements:
glibc version 2.25 or later
4 GB RAM and 10 GB disk space
Network connectivity to vCenter and ESX hosts
Ensure that you have a vSphere user with the following permissions:
Read privileges to VMs
Read privileges to all the ESX hosts
Guest operation modifications
Guest operation program execution
Guest operation queries
Ensure that you have a user with administrator or root rights to all the
target guest VMs.
Download mcdc CLI
Connect to the Linux machine:
ssh MACHINE_IP
Replace MACHINE_IP with the IP address of your Linux machine.
Download the latest version of the mcdc CLI and make it
executable:
curl -O "https://mc-release.storage.googleapis.com/mcdc/ $( curl -s https://mc-release.storage.googleapis.com/mcdc/latest ) /mcdc"
chmod +x mcdc
Perform VMware inventory discovery
Run the inventory discovery:
./mcdc discover vsphere -u USERNAME --url https:// VSPHERE_URL
Replace the following:
USERNAME : your vCenter username
VSPHERE_URL : the URL for your vCenter Server
instance or the vSphere Client
The output of the discover command looks like the following:
[+] Found 13 VMs
Collecting data...
13 / 13 [---------------------------------------------------] 100.00% 5 p/s
[✓] Collection completed.
Perform guest discovery on all discovered VMs
Run the guest discovery:
./mcdc discover vsphere guest all --url https:// VSPHERE_URL \
-u VCENTER_USER --vm-user VM_USER
Replace the following:
VCENTER_USER : the vCenter server user
VM_USER : the VM user
When prompted, enter the password for the VCENTER_USER
and VM_USER .
Generate reports to visualize the assessment
Generate a summary report:
./mcdc report --format html > Summary_Report.html
Generate a detailed report:
./mcdc report --format html --full > Detailed_Report.html
HTML files named Summary_Report.html and Detailed_Report.html are
created. Open the reports in a browser.
Clean up
There are no charges associated with running the mcdc CLI.
However, you can delete the collected data from the local database.
Delete the mcdc CLI data:
./mcdc discover purge-db -db DATABASE_NAME
Replace DATABASE_NAME with the path to the database where the
collected data is stored. Typically, it is in the same directory where you
downloaded the mcdc CLI.
