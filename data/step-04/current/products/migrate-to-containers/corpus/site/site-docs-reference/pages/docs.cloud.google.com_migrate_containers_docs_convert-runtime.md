Upgrade container workloads for enhanced runtime
If you have existing container workloads created using Migrate to Containers
versions 1.7.x and 1.8.x, you can convert them to use the simplified Linux service manager.
This conversion lets you then run these containers on GKE Autopilot clusters.
Note: Converting a container workload created by using Migrate to Containers
versions previous to 1.7.0 is not supported.
To perform the conversion, edit the Dockerfile and the deployment_spec.yaml file
created when you performed the original migration. Once edited, you can then
deploy the container workload on Autopilot clusters.
About converting container workloads
The procedure for converting existing workloads depends on whether you are converting
a stateless workload or stateful workload.
A stateful workload is one that maintains or stores state information. For stateful workloads,
you often mount additional volumes by using the StatefulSet in spec.containers.volumeMounts .
Make sure to retain the volumeMounts definitions while also
removing them for /sys/fs/cgroup .
See Mounting External Volumes for more information.
The general process of converting an existing workload requires you to edit the:
Dockerfile
Set the Migrate to Containers version to 1.15.0.
Insert two ADD commands to copy the logs.yaml file to the container image.
Insert a RUN command for the servicemanager_generate_config utility.
deployment_spec.yaml file to:
Delete the hostPath and volumeMounts definitions for /sys/fs/cgroup .
Delete the securityContext definition.
Delete the readinessProbe definition.
You can leave the mountPath and configMap definitions for logs-config ,
however logging does not currently work with the simplified Linux service manager.
For the specific conversion process, see the sections below:
Convert a stateless workload
Convert a stateful workload
Convert a stateless workload
The following example show how to convert a stateless container workload:
Locate the directory containing your existing migration artifacts, including
the deployment_spec.yaml file.
Edit the Dockerfile to set the product version, to copy the logs.yaml file,
and to run the servicemanager_generate_config utility:
...
# Set the product version to 1.15.0:
FROM anthos-migrate.gcr.io/v2k-run-embedded: v1.15.0 as migrate-for-anthos-runtime
...
ADD blocklist.yaml /.m4a/blocklist.yaml
# Insert the ADD commands to copy the `logs.yaml` file to the container image :
ADD logs.yaml /code/config/logs/logsArtifact.yaml
ADD logs.yaml /code/config/logs/logs.yaml
# Insert the RUN command for servicemanager_generate_config:
RUN /servicemanager_generate_config build-all -o /.m4a/
# Migrate to Containers image includes entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT [ "/.v2k.go" ]
Open the deployment_spec.yaml file in an editor. For example:
vi deployment_spec.yaml
Locate the following section in the file and delete the indicated lines:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
creationTimestamp : null
name : IMAGE_NAME
…
spec :
containers :
- image : gcr.io/ PROJECT_NAME / IMAGE_NAME : LABEL
name : IMAGE_NAME
# Delete the following lines:
readinessProbe :
exec :
command :
- /code/ready.sh
resources : {}
securityContext :
privileged : true
volumeMounts :
- mountPath : /sys/fs/cgroup
name : cgroups
- mountPath : /code/config/logs
name : logs-config
volumes :
- hostPath :
path : /sys/fs/cgroup
type : Directory
name : cgroups
- configMap :
name : suitecrm-crddefault-logs
name : logs-config
# Stop the delete here.
Add the lines below to set the HC_V2K_SERVICE_MANAGER environment variable.
Caution: If you are using Migrate to Containers 1.10 or later, skip this
step.
spec :
containers :
- image : gcr.io/ PROJECT_NAME / IMAGE_NAME : LABEL
name : IMAGE_NAME
# Add the following lines:
env :
- name : HC_V2K_SERVICE_MANAGER
value : "true"
Save the file.
Ensure that the target cluster has read access to the Docker image registry
as described in Ensure the target cluster has read access to the Docker image registry .
Build the updated image and push to Container Registry with an updated version
tag, ensuring you allow enough time for the build to finish. In the
following example, the image is in the current directory:
gcloud builds submit --timeout 4h --tag gcr.io/ PROJECT_NAME / IMAGE_NAME : LABEL .
Deploy the container:
kubectl apply -f deployment_spec.yaml
If you apply the deployment spec to an Autopilot cluster without the necessary
changes in deployment_spec.yaml , you see an error message in the form:
"Trying to run without root privileges is not possible. Did you try to use the new runtime?
In that case please pass the environment variable HC_V2K_SERVICE_MANAGER=true to the pod"
View the pods that are being deployed to the cluster.
Note: Loading the nodes and pulling the image might take a few minutes.
kubectl get pods
Convert a stateful workload
The following example show how to convert a stateful container workload:
Locate the directory containing your existing migration artifacts, including
the deployment_spec.yaml file.
Edit the Dockerfile to set the product version and run the
servicemanager_generate_config utility:
...
# Set the product version to 1.15.0:
FROM anthos-migrate.gcr.io/v2k-run-embedded: v1.15.0 as migrate-for-anthos-runtime
...
ADD blocklist.yaml /.m4a/blocklist.yaml
# Insert the ADD commands to copy the `logs.yaml` file to the container image :
ADD logs.yaml /code/config/logs/logsArtifact.yaml
ADD logs.yaml /code/config/logs/logs.yaml
# Insert the RUN command for servicemanager_generate_config:
RUN /servicemanager_generate_config build-all -o /.m4a/
# Migrate to Containers image includes entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT [ "/.v2k.go" ]
Open the deployment_spec.yaml file in an editor. For example:
vi deployment_spec.yaml
Locate the following three sections in the file and delete the indicated lines:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : StatefulSet
...
spec :
containers :
- image : gcr.io/ PROJECT_NAME / IMAGE_NAME : LABEL
name : IMAGE_NAME
# Delete the following lines:
readinessProbe :
exec :
command :
- /code/ready.sh
resources : {}
securityContext :
privileged : true
# Stop the delete here.
volumeMounts :
# Delete the following lines:
- mountPath : /sys/fs/cgroup
name : cgroups
# Stop the delete here.
- mountPath : /opt/suitecrm-7.10.5-0/mysql/data
name : data-pvc-0-1b12-d0af-48b3-9f5e-6c25fa5
subPath : opt/suitecrm-7.10.5-0/mysql/data
volumes :
# Delete the following lines:
- hostPath :
path : /sys/fs/cgroup
type : Directory
name : cgroups
# Stop the delete here.
- name : data-pvc-2-d0af-48b3-9f5e09c25fa5
persistentVolumeClaim :
claimName : data-pvc-0-1a2-d0af-48b3-9f5e-605fa5
Notice that you only remove the volumeMounts and volumes
definitions for cgroups and leave the remaining definitions.
Add the following lines to set the HC_V2K_SERVICE_MANAGER environment variable:
Caution: If you are using Migrate to Containers 1.10 or later, skip this
step.
spec :
containers :
- image : gcr.io/ PROJECT_NAME / IMAGE_NAME : LABEL
name : IMAGE_NAME
# Add the following lines:
env :
- name : HC_V2K_SERVICE_MANAGER
value : "true"
# Stop the add here.
volumeMounts :
- mountPath : /opt/suitecrm-7.10.5-0/mysql/data
name : data-pvc-0-1b12-d0af-48b3-9f5e-6c25fa5
subPath : opt/suitecrm-7.10.5-0/mysql/data
volumes :
- name : data-pvc-2-d0af-48b3-9f5e09c25fa5
persistentVolumeClaim :
claimName : data-pvc-0-1a2-d0af-48b3-9f5e-605fa5
Save the file.

Post conversion tasks
After you convert an existing migration to use the simplified Linux service manager,
you might want to modify it to:
Update the services used by the migrated workload.
Add new services.
For both scenarios, you must edit the Dockerfile, then rebuild the
container image.
Update services
In this section, you edit the Dockerfile to update the services-config.yaml file
in the container based on changes made in /etc/systemd on the migrated workload.
To update the container image for a change to an existing service:
Add the servicemanager_generate_config command in the Dockerfile:
Note: Add the servicemanager_generate_config command directly to the Dockerfile.
Do not try to run it inside the container workload.
...
FROM anthos-migrate.gcr.io/v2k-run-embedded: v1.15.0 as migrate-for-anthos-runtime
...
ADD blocklist.yaml /.m4a/blocklist.yaml
# Use the update command for servicemanager_generate_config to update the configuration :
RUN /servicemanager_generate_config update -u /.m4a/
# Migrate to Containers image includes entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT [ "/.v2k.go" ]
Build the updated image and push to Container Registry with an updated version
tag, ensuring you allow enough time for the build to finish. In the
following example, the image is in the current directory:
gcloud builds submit --timeout 4h --tag gcr.io/ PROJECT_NAME / IMAGE_NAME : LABEL .
Deploy the newly built image:
kubectl set image deployment/myWorkload my-app=gcr.io/ PROJECT_NAME / IMAGE_NAME : LABEL --record
Add services
To add a service to the container image:
Add the servicemanager_generate_config command in the Dockerfile:
Note: Add the servicemanager_generate_config command directly to the Dockerfile.
Do not try to run it inside the container workload.
...
FROM anthos-migrate.gcr.io/v2k-run-embedded: v1.15.0 as migrate-for-anthos-runtime
...
ADD blocklist.yaml /.m4a/blocklist.yaml
# This example adds the redis-server service.
# Add the following lines to install redis-server.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install redis-server
# Use the servicemanager_generate_config add command to add
# redis-server to the configuration :
RUN /servicemanager_generate_config add redis-server -u /.m4a/
# Migrate to Containers image includes entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT [ "/.v2k.go" ]
Build the updated image and push to Container Registry with an updated version
tag, ensuring you allow enough time for the build to finish. In the
following example, the image is in the current directory:
gcloud builds submit --timeout 4h --tag gcr.io/ PROJECT_NAME / IMAGE_NAME : LABEL .
Deploy the newly built image:
kubectl set image deployment/myWorkload my-app=gcr.io/ PROJECT_NAME / IMAGE_NAME : LABEL --record
servicemanager_generate_config syntax
The servicemanager_generate_config utility takes the following options:
build-all -o /.m4a/ : Rebuilds the migration and writes
the configuration to the m4a directory. Do not change the name of the directory.
Use this form of the command when you first convert your migration to use the
simplified Linux service manager.
update -u /.m4a/ : Update the list of existing services in the m4a directory.
Do not change the name of the directory.
add SERVICE_NAME -u /.m4a/ : Add service name to the migration
and writes the configuration to the m4a directory. Do not change the name of the directory.
To add multiple services, add multiple RUN /servicemanager_generate_config commands,
one per service.
