Create a migration plan
After creating a copy of the source machine's file system on your local machine,
the next step is to analyze the file system to prepare a migration plan. The
migration plan can then be used to generate migration artifacts.
This page describes the steps required to prepare a migration plan for
different workloads.
Create a migration plan for a Linux VM container
To perform the analysis, run the following command:
./m2c analyze \
-s PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM \
-p linux-vm-container \
-o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH \
[ -r skip_size_checks= SKIP_SIZE_CHECKS ] \
[ -r big_files_threshold_mb= SIZE_IN_MB ]
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM : the path to copied file system
directory.
ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH : the path to the folder where you
want the analysis output to be created.
SKIP_SIZE_CHECKS : this is an optional parameter.
By default, this is set to false and Migrate to Containers CLI checks the image
layers to ensure that the size doesn't exceed 15 GB. If the
total size of the image layers exceeds 15 GB, then the artifact generation
fails and Migrate to Containers CLI displays an error message. To skip
this size check, set this parameter to true .
SIZE_IN_MB : this is an optional parameter. Specify a
file size threshold, in MB, to check for files that exceed a
specific size. If Migrate to Containers CLI detects a file with a size that exceeds
the specified size threshold, then Migrate to Containers CLI adds a comment in the
generated migration plan with a suggestion to exclude the detected file
from the container image.
After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified
output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
Create a migration plan for Tomcat workloads
For Tomcat app components, this process requires the
catalina-home and catalina-base paths as inputs.
To retrieve these values, check the running Tomcat server process:
ps aux | grep catalina
To perform the analysis, run the following command:
./m2c analyze \
-s PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM \
-p tomcat-container \
-o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH \
-r catalina-home= PATH_TO_CATALINA_HOME \
-r catalina-base= PATH_TO_CATALINA_BASE \
-r java-version= JAVA_VERSION
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM : the path to copied file system
directory
ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH : the path to the folder where you
want the analysis output to be created
PATH_TO_CATALINA_HOME : path to the root of the Tomcat
installation
PATH_TO_CATALINA_BASE : path to the root of the runtime
configuration of the Tomcat instance that you're migrating.
Multiple bases should be separated using colon
JAVA_VERSION : Java version of the container in X.Y
format. The default Java version is 11.0 .
After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified
output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
Create a migration plan for WebSphere workloads
Optional: Set up the binaryAppScanner.jar
Note: If you want to migrate Liberty workloads and maintain their Java environment,
you don't need to set up the binaryAppScanner.jar .
If you want to migrate WebSphere traditional workloads, or perform a migration
between different Java environments, you can set up the binaryAppScanner.jar .
Migrate to Containers CLI automates the use of the binaryAppScanner.jar to generate
new WebSphere configurations and facilitate Java runtime modernization.
To set up the binaryAppScanner.jar :
Download the installer file, binaryAppScannerInstaller.jar , from
IBM Support .
You must accept the license agreement as part of the download.
Extract the binaryAppScanner.jar file and accept the license agreement:
java -jar binaryAppScannerInstaller.jar --acceptLicense --verbose INSTALL_LOCATION
Replace the following:
INSTALL_LOCATION : the target directory for extraction.
For example, if you specify /tmp as the target directory, after the
installation is complete, binaryAppScanner.jar is available at
/tmp/wamt/binaryAppScanner.jar .
Perform the analysis
To perform the analysis, run the following command:
./m2c analyze \
-s PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM \
-p websphere-container \
-o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH \
-r websphere-profile= WEBSPHERE_PROFILE \
-r websphere-home= WEBSPHERE_HOME \
-r websphere-java-home= WEBSPHERE_JAVA_HOME \
-r target-profile= TARGET_PROFILE \
-r target-version= TARGET_VERSION \
-r target-edition= TARGET_EDITION \
-r target-se= TARGET_SE \
-r target-ee= TARGET_EE \
-r target-vendor= TARGET_VENDOR \
-r target-base-image= TARGET_BASE_IMAGE \
--volume PATH_TO_BINARYAPPSCANNER :/binaryAppScanner.jar
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM : the path to copied file
system directory.
ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH : the path to the folder where you
want the analysis output to be created.
WEBSPHERE_PROFILE : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the WebSphere profile used in the source VM.
Format: [Liberty|Traditional].
WEBSPHERE_HOME : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the path to the application server installation in the source VM.
WEBSPHERE_JAVA_HOME : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the path to the Java installation in the source VM.
TARGET_PROFILE : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the WebSphere profile to use in the target container.
Format: [Liberty|Traditional]. Defaults to the source profile.
TARGET_VERSION : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the WebSphere version to use in the target container.
Defaults to the source version.
TARGET_EDITION : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the WebSphere edition to use in the target container.
Format: [Base|Core|Open|ND]. Defaults to the source edition.
TARGET_SE : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the Java SE version to use in the target container.
Format: [SE8|SE11|SE17]. Defaults to the source Java SE.
TARGET_EE : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the Java EE or Jakarta EE version to use in the target container.
Format: [EE7|EE8|EE9|EE10]. Defaults to the source Java EE or Jakarta EE.
TARGET_VENDOR : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the Java vendor to use in the target container.
Format: [IBM Corporation|Oracle Corporation].
Defaults to the source Java vendor.
TARGET_BASE_IMAGE : this is an optional parameter.
Specify a base image to use for the target container.
PATH_TO_BINARYAPPSCANNER : this is an optional parameter.
Specify the path to the binaryAppScanner.jar file on your local machine.
After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified
output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
Create a migration plan for WebSphere traditional workloads
Important: The websphere-traditional plugin is now deprecated. For
existing customers, this plugin is still supported till December 2023, after
which it will no longer be available. If you're new to WebSphere workload
modernization, then use the websphere-container plugin with the
Migrate to Containers CLI instead.
Set up the binaryAppScanner.jar
Download the latest version of the binaryAppScanner.jar file.
If you've already installed the binaryAppScanner.jar file, check the current
version:
java -jar binaryAppScanner.jar --version
Then, compare your current version to the version shown in the IBM license
that appears when you click Migration Toolkit for Application Binaries
to download the file. If they differ, download the latest version of the
binaryAppScanner.jar file.
Migrate to Containers CLI automates the use of the binaryAppScanner.jar , available
as part of the IBM WebSphere Application Server Migration Toolkit for Application Binaries ,
to extract configuration information and files for WebSphere Application Server
applications in the source VM.
Before you can perform a migration, you must accept the license agreement and download the IBM WebSphere Application Server Migration Toolkit for Application Binaries , and then extract the binaryAppScanner.jar file.
To set up binaryAppScanner.jar :
Download the installer file, binaryAppScannerInstaller.jar , from
IBM Support .
You must accept the license agreement as part of the download.
Run the following command to extract the binaryAppScanner.jar file and to
accept the License Agreement:
java -jar binaryAppScannerInstaller.jar --acceptLicense --verbose
Specify the target directory for the extraction. For example, if
you specify /tmp as the target directory, after the installation is complete,
binaryAppScanner.jar is available at /tmp/wamt/binaryAppScanner.jar .
Retrieve WAS_HOME
The WAS_HOME environment variable specifies where WebSphere Application Server
traditional is installed, such as /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/ . Migrate to Containers CLI uses
this value to correctly locate and analyze the WebSphere traditional configuration.
To retrieve this value, check the running WebSphere Application Server traditional process:
ps aux | grep WAS_HOME
Run the analysis
To perform the analysis, run the following command:
./m2c analyze \
-s PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM \
-p websphere-traditional-container -o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH \
-r was-home= PATH_TO_WAS_HOME \
--volume PATH_TO_BINARYAPPSCANNER :/binaryAppScanner.jar
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM : the path to copied file system
directory.
ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH : the path to the folder where you
want the analysis output to be created.
PATH_TO_WAS_HOME : path to the WebSphere Application
Server traditional installation.
PATH_TO_BINARYAPPSCANNER : path to the
binaryAppScanner.jar file. For example, if you specified /tmp as your
target directory, then binaryAppScanner.jar is available at
/tmp/wamt/binaryAppScanner.jar .
After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified
output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
Create a migration plan for JBoss workloads
For JBoss app components, creating a migration plan requires the
JBOSS_HOME variable as an input.
To retrieve this value, check the running JBoss server process:
ps aux | grep jboss.home.dir
To perform the analysis, run the following command:
./m2c analyze \
-s PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM \
-p jboss-container \
-o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH \
-r jboss-home= PATH_TO_JBOSS_HOME
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM : the path to copied file system
directory
ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH : the path to the folder where you
want the analysis output to be created
PATH_TO_JBOSS_HOME : path to the JBoss installation
After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified
output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
Create a migration plan for Apache workloads
To perform the analysis, run the following command:
./m2c analyze \
-s PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM \
-p apache-container \
-o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM : the path to copied file system
directory
ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH : the path to the folder where you
want the analysis output to be created
After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified
output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
Create a migration plan for WordPress workloads
To perform the analysis, run the following command:
./m2c analyze \
-s PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM \
-p wordpress-container \
-o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_COPIED_FILESYSTEM : the path to copied file system
directory
ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH : the path to the folder where you
want the analysis output to be created
After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified
output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
Create a migration plan for Windows IIS services
To perform the analysis, run the following command:
./m2c analyze -s PATH_TO_IMAGE -p windows-iis-container -o ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH
Replace the following:
PATH_TO_IMAGE : the path to source machine disk
image. You can specify more than one disk image at a time using multiple -s
flags. For example, -s PATH_TO_IMAGE_1 -s PATH_TO_IMAGE_2 ...-s PATH_TO_IMAGE_N .
ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH : the path to the folder where you
want the analysis output to be created.
After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified
output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
