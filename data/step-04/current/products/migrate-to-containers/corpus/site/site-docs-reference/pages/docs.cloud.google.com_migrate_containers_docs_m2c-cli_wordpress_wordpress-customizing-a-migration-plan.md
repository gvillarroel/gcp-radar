Customize migration plan for WordPress sites
You should review the migration plan file that resulted from creating a migration.
Customize the file before executing the migration. The details of
your migration plan are used to extract the workload container artifacts from the source.
This section describes the contents of the migration and the kinds of
customizations you might consider before you execute the migration and generate
deployment artifacts.
Before you begin
Ensure that you've already created a migration
and have the migration plan file.
If your WordPress site relies on a database connection, then ensure that the
database is accessible
from the target cluster as Migrate to Containers doesn't automatically migrate
it.
Note: To change the site's URL as part of the migration, you need to
update the database contents .
Edit the migration plan
After you have copied the file system and analyzed it, you can find the
migration plan in the new directory that is created in the specified output
path: ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH / config.yaml .
Edit the migration plan as necessary and save the changes.
Review your migration plan details and guiding comments to add information as
needed. Specifically, consider edits around the following sections.
Migration plan structure
The migration plan for a WordPress workload has the following structure, which
you can customize as described in the following sections.
sites :
- # Image name. Edit this to change the artifacts naming.
imageName : wordpress
# Parent WordPress image for the generated container image.
fromImage : wordpress : 6.1 - php7 . 4 - apache
# WordPress root directory.
rootDirectory : / var / www / html /
# Database connection values.
databaseValues :
- name : DB_NAME
value : database_name_here
- name : DB_USER
value : username_here
- name : DB_PASSWORD
value : password_here
- name : DB_HOST
value : host_here
To add information as needed, review your migration plan details and guiding
comments.
Specifically, consider edits around the following sections.
Specify the Docker image
In the migration plan, generate a Docker community image tag based on the
WordPress version.
If you want to change the Docker community image, or provide your own docker image,
you can modify the fromImage tag in your migration plan using the following format:
# Parent WordPress image for the generated container image.
fromImage : wordpress:6.1-php7.4-apache
Specify the database connection configuration
The databaseValues section contains the database connection configuration
extracted from the VM. Modify these values to change the database connection.
These values are passed to the migrated pod.
Data migration plan structure
The data migration plan for a WordPress workload has the following structure:
volumes :
- deploymentPvcName : wordpress - pvc
folders :
- / var / www / html / wp - content
newPvc :
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteOnce
resources :
requests :
storage : 10 G
The uploaded content, plugins, and themes that reside in the wp-content
folder in your WordPress VM are
exported to a persistent volume claim (PVC). The PVC is attached and mounted to
the migrated pod.
