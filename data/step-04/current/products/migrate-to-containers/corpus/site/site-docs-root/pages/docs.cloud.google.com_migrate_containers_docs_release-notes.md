Announcement
On March 27, 2023 we released version 1.1.0 of the Migrate to Containers modernization plugins.
Learn how to Upgrade Migrate to Containers plugins .
v1.14.1
Feature
Introduced the following features for JBoss migration:
Support for JBoss versions has been extended and Migrate to Containers now supports migration of JBoss EAP versions 7.0 - 7.4 to equivalent Wildfly community based container images, besides migrations of Wildfly versions 8.1.0 - 26.1.1.
Secrets are now automatically created from extracted security realms configuration and key-stores. This new feature fixes potential security risks and lets you update secrets without having to recreate images.
The targetImageHome property has been added to the migration plan to allow users to specify an alternative container image with a different JBOSS_HOME location.
The ExcludeFiles property has been added to the migration plan, which lets you explicitly exclude files and directories from the container image.
The data migration feature now automates the creation and mounting of a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) for the $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/data directory. This directory is available for use by services that require storing content in the file system.
v1.14.1
Feature
Preview : Added support for refactoring WordPress Servers running on Apache2 Linux to containers, which lets you deploy WordPress sites as containers on GKE, GKE Autopilot clusters, Anthos clusters, and Cloud Run.
For more information, see Migrate a WordPress site .
v1.14.1
Fixed
Filtering out files located at /tmp when discovering Tomcat application dependencies.
v1.14.1
Issue
Docker images may contain broken symlinks. Ensure that the tar archive artifacts added to dockerfile don't contain symlinks that don't resolve to another file in the archive. If they do, either retrieve the files from the source VM and add them to the dockerfile manually, or replace the symlinks in the source VM and perform extraction again.
March 20, 2023
v1.14.1
Announcement
On March 20, 2023 we released Migrate to Containers 1.14.1.
v1.14.1
Feature
Migrate to Containers now supports Workforce identity federation .
v1.14.1
Announcement
Documentation restructured to provide better visibility of high-level tasks.
v1.14.1
Deprecated
Using Anthos for VMware processing clusters for containerisation of VMware sources is now deprecated and is planned to be supported till July 2023.
v1.14.1
Issue
The following are open issues:
migctl migration status sometimes prints an error message before the migration table. This message does not indicate a concrete problem and can be ignored.
The UI fails when performing "Processing Cluster Add" having Resource Location Org Policy. To overcome that the processing cluster installation should be done using migctl and the target region should be provided using --gcp-region .
Creation of multiple source providers at the same time might cause timeouts. If this happens, delete and recreate source provider objects that failed to be created.
Replicated VM deletion might hang depending on other object deletion. To prevent this from happening, delete the Migrate to Virtual Machines (M2VM) source after deleting the corresponding Migration objects. Otherwise, if this happens, delete the M2VM replications manually.
Generated Kubernetes deployment specifications might contain invalid (non-DNS1123 compliant) container names when such names appear in the source VM. To prevent this from happening, go over the migration plan before generating artifacts and change the names to be DNS1123 compliant.
v1.14.1
Fixed
The following issues were fixed:
migctl setup uninstall failure - source snapshot is not deleted . This is happening when the corresponding source provider was already deleted.
Starting a migration from the UI page "Sources & Candidates" might get stuck on a "retrying" step.
December 06, 2022
v1.14.0
Announcement
On Dec 6, 2022 we released Migrate to Containers 1.14.0.
v1.14.0
Feature
Enhanced control on the verbosity of backend logs. You can now use the migctl logging set-verbosity <verbosity> command, where verbosity 0 corresponds to info logs only and verbosity 1 shows debug logs. See migctl reference .
v1.14.0
Feature
Support for refactoring Apache 2 Linux based applications to containers, which lets you deploy Apache 2 application components as containers on GKE, GKE Autopilot clusters, Anthos clusters, and Cloud Run, released for Public Preview. See Migrate Apache 2 Servers .

Feature
Support for refactoring applications running on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or WildFly application platform to containers, which lets you deploy the application as containers on GKE, GKE Autopilot clusters, Anthos clusters, and Cloud Run, released for Public Preview. See Migrate JBoss Servers .
v1.14.0
Deprecated
Containerization from AWS, Azure, and local vSphere (Anthos on vSphere) sources and local processing in AWS clusters are now deprecated and planned to be supported until April 2023.
v1.14.0
Fixed
The following issues were fixed:
Windows IIS modernization - In case IIS files are not accessible to BUILTIN/Administrators, the discovery phase of IIS modernization will fail.
Support migration of Windows IIS sites where Administrator user has no permissions to access the IIS configuration files.
On Linux migrations, if the migration plan YAML is missing the Image section, the task will fail with a panic instead of an indicative message.
v1.14.0
Issue
The following are open issues:
migctl migration status sometimes prints an error message before the migration table. This message does not indicate a concrete problem and can be ignored.
UI fails when performing "Processing Cluster Add" having Resource Location Org Policy. To overcome that, the processing cluster installation should be done using migctl and the target region should be provided using --gcp-region .
Two migrations from different M2VM sources on the same VM can affect each other. When using M2VM sources, users should avoid creating multiple Migration objects from different sources at the same time for the same VM.
Creation of multiple source providers at the same time may cause timeouts. If this happens users should delete and recreate source provider objects that failed to be created.
Replicated VM deletion can hang depending on other object deletion. To prevent this from happening users should delete M2VM source after deleting the corresponding Migration objects. Otherwise, if this happens users should delete the M2VM replications manually.
migctl setup uninstall failure - source snapshot is not deleted. This is happening when the corresponding source provider was already deleted. If this happens users should recreate the corresponding source provider and after migrations are removed to proceed with uninstalling.
Starting a migration from the UI page "Sources & Candidates" might get stuck on a "retrying" step. If this happens users should create a Migration using the VM name as input.
September 20, 2022
v1.13.0
Announcement
On Sep 20, 2022 we released Migrate to Containers 1.13.0
v1.13.0
Feature
Support for refactoring Tomcat applications to containers, which lets you deploy Tomcat application components as containers on GKE, GKE Autopilot clusters, Anthos clusters and Cloud Run, has moved from the Public Preview stage to General Availability.
v1.13.0
Feature
Added Kubevirt UEFI support. Virtual machines with UEFI firmware can now be migrated without user interaction. Migrations to Anthos VM Runtime that previously failed due to this limitation will need to be recreated.
v1.13.0
Feature
Added periodic health checks for migration sources to assure migration source availability and health. Migrate for Containers periodically checks the status of the source providers to reflect potential problems such as missing service accounts or lack of permissions. This enhancement helps ensure smooth operation and alerts you of failure cases.
v1.13.0
Feature
New progress indication to Migrate to Containers CLI tool - Running migctl migration status displays the progress of snapshot creation stage, upload progress of generate artifact stage, and for Linux migration, the progress of packing the image file.
v1.13.0
Feature
Windows IIS Application modernization:
Added support for Windows services. This allows you to specify Windows services that should be part of the migrated Windows IIS application. With this new capability you can migrate Windows IIS applications that are dependent on other windows services.
Added support for generation of Kubernetes health probes. Health probe monitoring can help reduce the downtime of your application and provide better service monitoring. Migrate for Containers creates the required probes section in the deployment YAML. The Windows IIS health probes are enabled by default and can be disabled or modified while customizing the migration plan.
Added support for automated COM object registration. Windows DLLs that contain COM objects are copied to the target image and are automatically registered as a COM object.
v1.13.0
Fixed
The following issues were fixed:
Removed support for Windows SAC images following Microsoft announcement concerning Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel end of servicing.
Propagate discovery failures into the migration status.
Don't show the warning skipping setup of default image and artifact repositories because either --json-key, --gcp-project or --gcp-region weren't specified when all parameters are given on Anthos on Bare Metal installations.
The v2k-websphere image is now up-to-date (the promoted one).
Separated the logic of creating a source and validating its status. When creating an unhealthy source, the create command would succeed with an indication that there is a problem in the source.
v1.13.0
Issue
The following are open issues:
If IIS files are not accessible to BUILTIN/Administrators, the discovery phase of IIS modernization will fail.
Support migration of Windows IIS sites where Administrator user has no permissions to access the IIS configuration files.
On Linux migrations, if the migration plan YAML is missing the Image section, the task will fail with a panic instead of an indicative message.
On Migrate for Compute Engine, source creation can fail because it's unable to find a secret caused by a race issue of the reconciler and the secret creation.
Workaround: reconciler should be updated of the new secret after a few minutes. Error: Source mysrc was created with an error: Secret <some_secret> not found
On Tomcat, if path X is defined on excludeFiles, and its ancestor directory is defined on additionalFIles, we will migrate X instead of excluding it.
When using Migrate for Compute Engine 5 as a migration source, if two Migrate To Container sources were created referring to the same Migrate for Compute Engine source, migrations created from both sources may interfere with each other.
Workaround: delete one of the sources.
July 13, 2022

v1.12.0
Feature
Modernize VMs to run Anthos for VMs (A4VM)
Migrate to Containers has added a new modernization feature, which enables traditional VMs to run on Anthos for VMs. Anthos for VMs extends Anthos on bare metal (now known as Google Distributed Cloud Virtual) to let you run and manage containers and VMs on a unified, Google Cloud-connected platform in your data center or at the edge. For more information on this feature, see About Anthos for VMs .
v1.12.0
Announcement
Improved migration flow and task APIs
A new structured method for generalizing the Migrate to Containers containerization process is available. The new structure provides more flexibility and more granular control of the automated containerization process. The new structure enables users to customize the process and enables support for additional software framework modernization. The following containerization tasks elements are available:
AppXGenerateArtifactsTask
AppXGenerateArtifactsFlow
The following migration types are now deprecated and planned to be removed in version 1.13. The corresponding AppX objects and parameters can be used to perform migration for these workload types:

May 17, 2022
v1.11.1
Feature
Tomcat improvements
On the migration plan fromImage field, in case the tool did not automatically discover the Tomcat version used on original VM, a placeholder text (example: tomcat:<TomcatVersion>-jre11-openjdk ) was added that would need to be populated by the user. If the information is not populated a blocking warning will be surfaced on Artifacts generation step, requiring the user to provide the Tomcat version details.
Renaming catalinaHome.tar.gz artifact to tomcatServer.tar.gz .
bin and lib directories are filtered from the tomcatServer.tar.gz file.

v1.7.5
Fixed
185975192: Webhook certificates no longer expire after one month. An expired certificate caused API requests to fail.
v1.7.5
Change
Following the Microsoft decision to end support for the Windows 10, version 1909 architecture, the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) team removed support for this architecture on its GKE and Anthos clusters. This change means that you must update all Windows containers built for this architecture.
When migrating Windows workloads, you have to perform the following:
If you have existing Windows containers that you created using Migrate for Anthos version 1.7 or earlier, then you have to rebuild the containers to create containers capable of running on supported Windows architectures.
If you are currently using Migrate for Anthos to migrate Windows workloads, you must update your Migrate for Anthos processing clusters to use version 1.7.5 and update the node pools to use the supported Windows architecture.
Rebuild deployed Windows containers
If you have existing Windows containers created using Migrate for Anthos version 1.7 or earlier, rebuild the container to use a supported Windows architecture. You require the generated artifacts folder generated for the container to make this change:
At the top of the Dockerfile in the generated artifacts folder, edit the FROM command to update the image.
For example, for the following FROM command:
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore:1909
Replace the image as shown below:
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:latest
The following table shows the existing image and the image used to replace it:
Existing image name
New image name
mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:1909
mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:latest
mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore-1909
mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:latest
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:3.5-windowsservercore-1909
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:3.5
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.8-windowsservercore-1909
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.8
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf:4.8-windowsservercore-1909
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf:latest
Rebuild the container images as described at Building the container image .
Update your Migrate for Anthos processing clusters
If you are currently using Migrate for Anthos to migrate new Windows workloads, you must update your version of Migrate for Anthos to 1.7.5 and update your processing cluster to use a node pool of type WINDOWS_LTSC . Node pools of type WINDOWS_SAC are no longer supported.
To update your processing cluster:
Update your version of Migrate for Anthos to 1.7.5 .
On your processing cluster, replace the WINDOWS_SAC node pool with WINDOWS_LTSC .
Add the WINDOWS_LTSC new pool:
-- project = project - name -- zone = gcp - zone -- cluster = cluster - name \
-- image - type = WINDOWS_LTSC -- num - nodes = 1 -- scopes = "cloud-platform" \
-- machine - type = n1 - standard - 4 ```
Delete the WINDOWS_SAC node pool:
Note: You can determine the name of the node pool that each node in your cluster belongs to, as well as the name of the node s architecture, by running kubectl describe nodes` command while authenticated to the cluster.
--project=project-name --zone=gcp-zone --cluster=cluster-name```

By default, Migrate for Anthos automatically disables unneeded services on a VM when you migrate it to a container. You can now edit the migration plan to optionally disable additional services on the container, either services discovered by Migrate for Anthos or your own list of services. See Customizing a migration plan for more.
v1.7.0
Issue
183082390: The collection script used by the Linux discovery tool uses service --status-all to query system V services. Depending on the services installed on the VM, service --status-all might call custom routines. In some cases, this call might take an arbitrary amount of time depending on the services installed.
v1.7.0
Issue
182208300: When building a Docker image for a Windows container, examine the logs. Sometimes an internal step can fail, even when the build command shows that the build was successful.

migctl setup upgrade --json-key key
Where key is the JSON key for the service account required for migctl installation. See Configuring service accounts .
v1.6.0
Feature
Previous releases of Migrate for Anthos required that you used Google Container Registry (GCR) and Google Cloud Storage for data repositories. This release adds support for additional repositories, including ECR, S3, and Docker registries that support basic authentication. See Defining data repositories for more.
v1.6.0
Issue
If you try to mount a secret on a deployed pod you will not be able to access it in /run/secrets . This is typically an issue when giving workload identity permissions to the pod (where a secret is added by Kubernetes to hold the workload identity credentials).
The contents of the secrets directory are in /kubernetes-info/secrets .
Workaround : Run the following command on the deployed pod:
ln -s /kubernetes-info/secrets /run/secrets
If the /run mount gets deleted (by a process in the pod, or by a pod reset), you might have to run the command again.
v1.6.0
Feature
Support added for using Anthos clusters on AWS as processing clusters to perform migrations of AWS workloads. This feature is in preview . See Prerequisites for migrating Linux VMs on AWS for more.

Feature
Support for migrating Windows VM workloads has moved from the Beta stage to general availability.
This release adds full support for migrating Windows VM workloads to the Google Cloud Console, including the ability to create a Windows migration source. See Migrating a Windows VM for more.
v1.5.0
Feature
Migrate for Anthos provides tools that you run on a Linux or Windows VM workload to determine the workload's fit for migration to a container. See Using the Linux discovery tool and Using the Windows discovery tool for more.
v1.5.0
Feature
Custom Services Blocklist support added which lets you define a list of services to disable in a migrated container. See Custom Services Blocklist for more.
v1.5.0
Issue
170706786 : The Linux Discovery Tool might return exit code 0 even when all information was collected successfully.
Workaround: Make sure you run the tool as a 'root' user or as a user with full sudo access.
v1.5.0
Feature
The image field value of the GenerateArtifactsFlow CRD defines the names and locations of two images created from a migrated VM. In previous releases, the names contained a predefined tag.
To ensure that the tag value is unique, the format of the tag has changed for this release to specify the timestamp of the migration.
You can also explicitly set the tag if you prefer to another value. See Setting the name of the container image for more.
v1.5.0
Issue
167656057 : Installation on a GKE cluster with ACM might fail. Indication of the error can be seen in the Migrate for Anthos upgrade job, in the v2k-system namespace.
For example:
kubectl logs -n v2k-system controllers-upgrade-fzlmz
Shows this error:
failed to validate admission controller - admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" does not support dry run
Workaround :
gatekeeper is an ACM component.
Manually deleting the upgrader job fixes the issue.
For example:
kubectl delete job -n v2k-system controllers-upgrade
v1.5.0
Issue
171123825 : In some cases, migration process might fail, and Cloud Logging indicate errors such as:
"failed to load map, error 6"
or:
"failed in domap for addition of new path sdd"
Workaround : Delete the migration and restart it.
In rare cases, a re-installation of the product is required.
v1.5.0
Issue
170627229 : Migrated workload of a JBoss application might fail at startup. Cloud Logging indicates an error in the form:
ERROR [org.jboss.as.server] (Controller Boot Thread) ...:
Caught exception during boot: java.lang.IllegalStateException: ...:
Could not rename /opt/jboss-7.1.1/standalone/configuration/.../standalone_xml_history/current to
/opt/jboss-7.1.1/standalone/configuration/.../standalone_xml_history/...
Workaround : Update your Dockerfile to remove the directory by adding a line in the form:
RUN rm -rf jboss-location/standalone/configuration/standalone_xml_history/current
Where jboss-location is a path such as /usr/local/share/jboss or
/opt/jboss-7.1.1 .
v1.5.0
Feature
When you deploy your migrated Windows containers to a cluster, you can now use a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) to execute the container under a specific service account identity. See Configuring gMSA for more.
v1.5.0
Issue
144896313 : Migrated workloads do not support SELinux. However, if the source VM had SELinux enabled at the time of migration, and you then check the status of SELinux on the migrated workload, SELinux will appear to be enabled. This issue has no affect on migrated workloads.
v1.5.0
Issue
157062328 : In some cases, adding a service to the blocklist using a configmap will not actually stop that service from running on the deployed workload.
Workaround :
Disable the service using in the Dockerfile (rather than a config-map), and rebuild the image.
v1.5.0
Issue
171714535 : In a GKE on-prem environment configured to use an egress HTTP/HTTPS proxy,
the migration process might get stuck.
Workaround :
Please contact support for more information.

In previous releases, you used a command in the form: migctl source create ce my-ce-src --project my-project --zone zone to create a migration for Compute Engine. The --zone option has been removed when creating a Compute Engine migration. Using the --zone option in this release causes an error.
v1.4.0
Feature
You can use Migrate for Anthos to migrate Windows VMs to workloads on GKE. This process clones your Compute Engine VM disks and uses the clone to generate artifacts (including a Dockerfile and a zip archive with extracted workload files and settings) you can use to build a deployable GKE image. See Adding a Windows migration source .
v1.4.0
Issue
161214397: In case of a missing service-account to upload container images to the Container Registry, the migration might get stuck.
Workaround: Add the service-account. If you are using the Migrate for Anthos CRD API, delete the GenerateArtifactsTask and recreate it. If using the migctl CLI tool, delete the migration and recreate it. You can first download the migration YAML using migctl migration get to back up any customizations you have made.
v1.4.0
Feature
Added the new --json-key sa.json option to the migctl source create ce command to create a migration for Compute Engine, where sa.json specifies a service account. See Optionally creating a service account when using Compute Engine as a migration source for more.
v1.4.0
Issue
161135630: Attempting multiple migrations of the same remote VM (from VMware, AWS or Azure) simultaneously, might result in a stuck migration process.
Workaround: Delete the stuck migration.
v1.4.0

v1.4.0
Issue
161110816: migctl migration create with a source that doesn't exist fails with a non-informative error message: request was denied .
v1.4.0
Fixed
GKE on-prem preview: If a source was created with migctl source create using the wrong credentials, you could not delete the migration with migctl migration delete . This issue has been fixed in the GA release of on-prem support.
v1.4.0
Deprecated
The migctl migration logs command has been removed. You now use the Google Console to view logs.
v1.4.0
Issue
160858543, 160836394, 160844377, 154430477, 154403665, 153241390, 153239696, 152408818, 151516642, 132002453: Unstable network in Migrate for Anthos infrastructure, or a GKE node restart, might cause migration to get stuck.
Workaround: Delete the migration and re-create it. If recreating the migration does not solve the issue, please contact support .
v1.4.0
Issue
160523841, 159106543: For Anthos GKE on-prem, in rare cases of high load, vSphere may report a failure when creating a resource even though the resource was correctly created. This may cause a snapshot or cloned VM resource leak when deleting the migration operation. The VMs or snapshots can then be manually deleted in vSphere.
v1.4.0
Deprecated
In version 1.4, by default Migrate for Anthos installs to and performs migrations
in the v2k-system namespace. In previous release, you could specify the namespace. The option to specify a namespace has been removed.
v1.4.0
Issue
157890913, 160082702, 161125635, 159693579 : A migration might continue to indicate that it is running, while an issue encountered prevents further processing.
Workaround : Check event messages on the migration object using the verbose migctl status command: migctl migration status migration_name -v . You might be able to correct the issue to allow the migration to continue or the migration should be deleted and recreated if an Error event is listed without further retries.
An example is when creating a Windows migration on a cluster with no Windows nodes. In this case the event message will show: Warning FailedScheduling 10s Pod discover-xyz 0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) didn't match node selector.
v1.4.0
Feature
The Google Cloud Console
provides a web-based, graphical user interface that you can use to manage your
Google Cloud Console projects and resources. Migrate for Anthos now supports the migration of workloads by using the Google Cloud Console.
In this release, the Migrate for Anthos on the Cloud Consoledoes not support migrations for Windows or for on-prem, including monitoring Windows or on-prem migrations.
v1.4.0
Feature
Changed the default settings on the Cloud processing cluster for migrating Linux workloads:
You no longer have to specify the --scopes "cloud-platform" option when creating the processing cluster.
You now must create a service account, with the necessary permissions, to:
Install Migrate for Anthos
Use Compute Engine as the migration source
If you currently have a processing cluster that uses the --scopes "cloud-platform" option, your cluster will continue to work. However, for new processing clusters, you should use the new procedure. See Enabling Google services and configuring service accounts for more.
v1.4.0
Issue
155051522: CSI health-check events are reported to their matching StorageClass object, and are not propagated to their matching SourceProvider object.

v1.3.0
Issue
152194161: Your migrated workload container fails when running a cluster with GKE nodes of type "COS". When you run the command kubectl logs [podname] , you might see the following:
apparmor . go : 385 ] Couldn ' t set label to lxc - container - default - write / proc / 1 / attr / current : no such file or directory
This is an indication that the required AppArmor profiles are not installed on the GKE nodes. To solve this, run migctl setup install --cos-runtime .
v1.3.0
Issue
151505531, 150052607: In some cases, migration can be stuck with no progress. When running migctl migration status migration-name --verbose , you might see an event such as this:
