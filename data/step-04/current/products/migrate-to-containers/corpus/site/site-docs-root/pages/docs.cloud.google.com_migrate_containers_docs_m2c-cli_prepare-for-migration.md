Set up for migration
Before you start the modernization process, you need to check whether your
application component is compatible for modernization and prepare your setup
for modernization.
This page describes how to prepare your source and local machines for
modernization.
Set up the Linux source machine
Note: If you're going to migrate Windows IIS applications, you don't need to
perform the steps to set up the Windows source machine for migration.
Install rsync :
On Debian:
sudo apt install rsync
On Fedora:
sudo dnf install rsync
Ensure that rsync is available in the PATH setting.
Set up the Linux local machine
Install Docker and
ensure that it is available in the PATH .
Note: To avoid issues that might occur while using Snap version of Docker ,
ensure that you install Docker without using Snap.
If the user running Migrate to Containers CLI is a non-root user, then
allow the non-root user to run containers .
Download or upgrade Migrate to Containers CLI
Download or upgrade the Migrate to Containers CLI on a Linux machine:
curl -O "https://m2c-cli-release.storage.googleapis.com/$(curl -s https://m2c-cli-release.storage.googleapis.com/latest)/linux/amd64/m2c"
chmod +x ./m2c
This downloads the latest version of the Migrate to Containers CLI and
Migrate to Containers plugins.
Check connectivity
Ensure that you can access the source machine from the local machine using
either direct SSH or the gcloud compute ssh command.
Note: The user used for SSH connection must be either a sudoer or root. If
the user used to perform SSH can't act as root, then Migrate to Containers CLI might
not be able to examine files and directories relevant to the modernization
process.
Optional: Set up for offline migration
If you want to perform migration on your local network without pulling
resources from the internet, then you can complete the following steps to
prepare your local machine for offline migrations.
After you've downloaded Migrate to Containers CLI, perform the
following steps:
Download the offline Migrate to Containers CLI plugins bundle:
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/modernize-plugins-prod/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/modernize-plugins-prod/latest)/m2c-offline-bundle-linux.tar
If required, copy the Migrate to Containers CLI and offline Migrate to Containers CLI
plugins bundle to the offline environment.
Unpack the offline Migrate to Containers CLI plugins bundle:
./m2c plugins unpack -i m2c-offline-bundle-linux.tar
To add support for offline data migration, specify a container registry
that is available in your local network:
./m2c plugins unpack -i m2c-offline-bundle-linux.tar --registry HOSTNAME
Replace HOSTNAME with the container registry hostname.
Your local machine is set up for offline migration. To upgrade the offline
Migrate to Containers CLI plugins bundle, upgrade Migrate to Containers CLI
to the latest version, and then repeat the steps to download and unpack the
plugins bundle.
If you want to turn off the offline mode later, then you can use the
config set command to set the offline option to false .
Set up the Windows local machine
You must be able to run as administrator on the local machine.
Install Docker .
Download or upgrade Migrate to Containers CLI
