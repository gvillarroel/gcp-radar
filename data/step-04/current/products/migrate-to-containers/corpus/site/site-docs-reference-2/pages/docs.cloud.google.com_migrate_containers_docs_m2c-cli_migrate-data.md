Migrate data
This page describes how to run a data migration that copies files from the
local machine to a persistent volume claim (PVC) in the target cluster.
This is an optional step.
Customize your data migration configuration
When you complete an analysis ,
Migrate to Containers CLI might create a data configuration file named dataConfig.yaml
in the specified analysis output directory. This indicates that to complete the
migration, you need to perform data migration.
You can also create this data configuration file manually for data migration,
and provide information about your target data volume or data claim.
Following is an example of a data configuration file:
volumes :
- deploymentPvcName : my-pvc1
existingPvc :
name : my-pvc1
folders :
- /bin
- /opt
- deploymentPvcName : my-pvc2
newPvc :
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteOnce
resources :
requests :
storage : 10G
folders :
- /bin
- /opt
Where:
deploymentPvcName : The PVC name to be used by Migrate to Containers
in your deployed workload to access this volume.
Note: In case you've already executed the migration ,
if you change this PVC name in the data configuration file, ensure that
you make the same change in the other migration artifacts, or execute the
migration again to update the generated artifacts.
existingPvc :
name : Name of an existing persistent volume claim (PVC). Define if you
want to migrate data volumes to an existing PVC.
newPvc : Define if you want to migrate your data volumes to a new PVC. You
can define your PVC using the standard PVC spec syntax.
For more information about Kubernetes PVC spec, see the Kubernetes
documentation.
Note: You can migrate a data volume to either an existing PVC or a new
PVC. Therefore, you must only define one of the two parameters, existingPvc
or newPvc , per volume.
folders : the folder you want to migrate from the VM to PVC. These folders are
copied to the PVC in the same path.
You can edit your data configuration file for several data migration use cases,
including:
Using an existing PVC
Creating new volumes on your migrated VM
Migrating multiple PVCs with multiple file paths
Use an existing PVC
If you've already allocated the storage for your migrated data, and have a
PVC to store your data, you can migrate your data using an existing PVC.
Define an existing PVC in your data configuration file dataConfig.yaml
by passing your existing volume in the existingPvc field. In this case, your
data configuration file would look like this:
volumes :
- deploymentPvcName : my-pvc
existingPvc :
name : my-pvc
subpath : /subpath
folders :
- /bin
- /opt
In the previous sample, the existingPvc entry can contain an optional
subPath to migrate data to the subpath of the PVC, as shown.
Note: The PVC has to be in the same namespace as the target namespace on the
deployment cluster.
Create new data volumes on your migrated VMs
If you've not allocated storage ahead of time, and you want your storage to be
created during the migration process, you can pass an empty existingPvc field
and specify the storage you would like to be created in the newPvc field:
volumes :
- deploymentPvcName : my-pvc
newPvc :
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteOnce
resources :
requests :
storage : 10G
folders :
- /bin
- /opt
Note: If you don't want to worry about the specifics of your backing storage,
use an empty string for the storage class, as shown in the preceding yaml.
Migrate multiple PVCs with multiple file paths
You can specify the set of directories under the folders list field of each
entry in the volume list for each PVC listed in your data configuration file
dataConfig.yaml :
volumes :
- deploymentPvcName : my-pvc1
existingPvc :
name : my-pvc1
folders :
- /bin
- /opt
- deploymentPvcName : my-pvc2
newPvc :
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteOnce
resources :
requests :
storage : 10G
folders :
- /bin
- /opt
The paths you list under folders in the data configuration file are copied to
the same paths in the target PVCs.
Execute the data migration
After you've customized your data configuration file dataConfig.yaml , to
migrate the data volumes to a PVC in the target cluster, run the following
command:
./m2c migrate-data -i ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH -n NAMESPACE
Replace the following:
ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH : the path where you saved the analysis
output that
contains the file dataConfig.yaml
NAMESPACE : the target Kubernetes cluster namespace of
the deployed network
