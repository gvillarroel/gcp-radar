Customize migration plan for Windows IIS services
Review the migration plan file that was populated during the creation of the
migration. You can customize it before proceeding to execute the migration.
The details of your migration plan are used to extract the workload container
artifacts from the source VM.
This section describes the contents of the migration plan and the kinds of
customizations that you might consider before you execute the migration, and
generate deployment artifacts.
Before you begin
This document assumes that you've already created a migration plan
and have the resulting migration plan file.

The globalSettings section
The globalSettings section describes basic requirements for pods running IIS
sites from this VM. The discovery process searches for general configurations
in the source VM, and uses them to populate this section. These configurations
contain fields present in the specific image configurations as described in
the following section, and affects all images at the same time.
The image section
The image section following globalSettings describes the list of
Windows features
to install on the pods. The discovery process populates this section with all
Windows features which exist on the original VM, and can be installed on a
Windows container.
Note: Not all Windows features can be
installed on Windows containers. Therefore, manually editing this section might
cause build errors.
The msvcRuntimes section
When migrating an application, it might have a dependency on a specific version
or versions of the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime (MSVCRT). Migrate to Containers
automatically detects the runtimes installed on the source VM and included them
in the migration plan.
You can modify the list of runtimes in the migration plan by adding or
removing members of msvcRuntimes :
The complete list of possible values are:
(The 2015 runtime also includes support for 2017, 2019, and 2022)
msvcRuntimes :
- MSVC2012_x64
- MSVC2013_x64
- MSVC2015_x64
- MSVC2012_x86
- MSVC2013_x86
- MSVC2015_x86
The pathEnvVarAdditionalEntries section
Windows IIS applications might have non-default PATH environment variable
entries, which are automatically detected on the source VM and included in the
migration plan. You can modify the PATH environment variables by editing the
members of pathEnvVarAdditionalEntries :
pathEnvVarAdditionalEntries :
- "C:\\myDllsFolder"
- "C:\\ProgramData\\SomeSoftware"
Edit the image section
You might want to edit the image section in the following cases:
Some suggested features are not be required by the migrated sites. This
happens if the source VM has usages other than hosting IIS sites.
You modified the IIS sections in the migration plan, and added
configurations that depend on additional Windows features. (For example,
Windows authentication depends on the Window authentication feature).
The target section
The target section specifies which base Windows image you're using (for
example 1909). You should rarely need to edit this field.
The images section
Each subitem of the images section specifies a single output image.
In the artifacts zip, each such image has a separate subdirectory, with its own Dockerfile and deployment_spec.yaml (see Deploying the container image ).
The name field
The name field describes the image name.
It affects the name of the image subdirectory and the deployment_spec.yaml
file in the artifacts.
The probes field
The probes field describes the health probe configuration of the image. To
learn more about kubelet probes, see
Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes .
Edit IIS health probes
Health probes can monitor the downtime and ready status of your managed
containers. Health probe monitoring can help reduce the downtime of migrated
containers and provide better monitoring.
Unknown health states can create availability degradation, false-positive
availability monitoring, and potential data loss. Without a health probe,
kubelet can only assume the health of a container and might send traffic to a
container instance that is not ready. If the instance is not ready, it can
cause traffic loss. Kubelet might also not detect containers that are in a
frozen state and doesn't restart them.
A health probe functions by running a small scripted statement when the
container starts. The script checks for successful conditions, which are
defined by the type of probe used, every period. The period is defined in the
migration plan by a periodSeconds field. You can define these probes manually
when you customize the migration plan.
There are three types of probes available to configure. All probes are
probe v1 core defined in probe v1 core reference
and share the same function as the corresponding fields of container v1 core .
* Liveness probe: Liveness probes are used to know when to restart a
container.
Note: If a process in your container is able to crash on its own when it
encounters an issue, or is unhealthy, you don't necessarily need a liveness
probe. The kubelet automatically performs the correct action in
accordance with the restartPolicy of the Pod.
Readiness probe: Readiness probes are used to know when a container is
ready to start accepting traffic. To start sending traffic to a pod only when
a probe succeeds, specify a readiness probe. A readiness probe might act
similarly to a liveness probe. However, a readiness probe indicates that a
pod starts without receiving any traffic and only start receiving traffic
after the probe succeeds.
Startup probe: The kubelet uses startup probes to know when a container
application has started. If such a probe is configured, it disables liveness
and readiness checks until it succeeds, making sure that those probes don't
interfere with the application startup.
After discovery, the probe configuration is added to the migration plan. The
probes can be used in their default configuration as shown in the following
example. The default configuration uses exec command for the liveness and
readiness probes. Both are using a PowerShell script called probe.ps1 that
calls IIS command-line tool appcmd to check the status of the IIS sites.
The probes are disabled by default, to enable the probes, set the enabled flag to true .

The windowsServices section
Windows containers created during a migration run and monitor a single Windows
IIS service. However, some workloads might require running additional services
(including a database, logging mechanism, proxy, and more) in order to function
correctly.
To run additional services in the migrated container, add entries to the
windowsServices section, and copy the necessary binaries in the
useractions section .
version: v1
globalSettings:
target:
…
globalIIS:
…
images:
- name: migrated-image-zgwb2
workloads:
sites:
site:
- applications:
...
bindings:
- port: 80
protocol: http
name: Default Web Site
…
windowsServices:
- MyService
useractions:
files:
- source: C:\Program Files\MyService
target: C:\Program Files\MyService
registry:
currentcontrolset:
- key: services\MyService
The useractions section
The useractions section specifies additional files and registry keys that you
might want to migrate.
For example:
useractions :
files :
- source : DRIVE :\ FOLDER-OR-FILE-PATH
target : DRIVE :\ FOLDER-OR-FILE-PATH
- source : C:\myfolder
target : C:\myfolder
- source : D:\myfile
target : D:\myfile
- source : D:\myfile
target : C:\myfile
...
registry :
currentcontrolset :
- path : KEY
...
software :
- path : KEY
...
The paths specified for currentcontrolset and software are to keys in the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet registry hive
or in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software registry hive.
Edit the useractions section
By default the only files copied to the image are the virtual directories of
sites in the specified image.
If your code or configurations import files from outside this directory, you
should add them to the useractions section.
Also, any registry values that your code depends on should be added by editing
the useractions registry section.
Settings related specifically to IIS
The IIS related settings are divided into settings related to specific sites,
which are part of the image specification, and settings related to all sites,
which are following the gloabalIis section.
Note: The IIS sections in the migration
plan are purposefully structured similarly to the IIS configuration files. They
must be readable to people with IIS background.
The sites section
The sites section describes the sites that are migrated
to a specific image. It's possible for several images to contain the same site.
If you want to use
Cloud Load Balancing, Ingress, or Cloud Service Mesh to handle the SSL configuration , then you need to set protocol to
http :
sites :
site :
- applications :
- path : /
virtualdirectories :
- path : /
physicalpath : '%SystemDrive%\inetpub\wwwroot'
bindings :
- port : 8080
protocol : http
name : Default Web Site
Note: Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are allowed in the protocol setting.
All protocols other than HTTP/HTTPS are skipped and not processed.
The apppools section
The apppools section describes the Application Pools created on the migrated pods.
The identitytype field specifies the IIS identity of an application pool as
either ApplicationPoolIdentity (default), NetworkService , LocalSystem , or
LocalService .
For more information, see Understanding identities in IIS
and Application Pool Identities .
The following is an example migration plan containing identitytype :
migrationPlan :
applications :
iis :
applicationhost :
apppools :
- name : DefaultAppPool
# Allowed values include: ApplicationPoolIdentity (default), NetworkService, LocalSystem, LocalService
identitytype="NetworkService"
- managedruntimeversion : v4.0
name : .NET v4.5 Classic
- managedruntimeversion : v4.0
name : .NET v4.5
When you execute the migration plan to generate the container artifacts,
Migrate to Containers automatically adds the necessary Dockerfile directives
according to the identitytype field setting.
For example, if you set identitytype to NetworkService the directive is in
the form:
RUN c:\windows\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set apppool \"DefaultAppPool\" \"/-processModel.identityType:NetworkService\";
Migrate to Containers automatically adds read ACL directives to the
site's folders according to the target identitytype , and for the IUSR
built-in user.
This is automatically done for application file system items where the original
application account was specified either by inheritance or explicitly.
For more information, see Set ACLs .
The enablegmsa field
The enablegmsa field is syntactic sugar in the migration plan. It's a
shortcut for overwriting the identity field of the application pool.
The supported values for enablegmsa field are:
auto (default): Convert the migrated container to use gMSA if
Migrate to Containers determines that its current configuration is not
allowed.
all : Always convert the migrated container to use gMSA and ignore the
setting of identitytype . In this case, identitytype is always
interpreted as being set to NetworkService .
The following is an example migration plan containing enablegmsa :
migrationPlan :
applications :
iis :
# Allowed values include: auto (default), all
enablegmsa : auto|all
To learn more, see
Configure your app to use a gMSA .
Connection strings
Connection strings
define a connection from the migrated container workload to a .NET Framework
data provider.
Migrate to Containers supports connection strings at the site and global scope.
To add a connection string to a site, edit the site definition in the
migration plan to set the connectionstrings property:
sites :
site :
# Add the site connection strings here.
connectionstrings :
- name : connectionname1
providername : System.Data.SqlClient
connectionstring : Database=connectedDB1;Password=Welcome1;User=admin;
- name : connectionname2
providername : System.Data.OleDb
connectionstring : Database=connectedDB2;Password=Welcome2;User=admin;
- applications :
- path : /
virtualdirectories :
...
To add a connection string to the global scope (making it accessible to all
sites), edit the connection strings directly following globalIis :
globalIis :
enablegmsa : auto
connectionStrings :
connectionstring :
- name : connectionname3
providername : System.Data.SqlClient
connectionstring : Database=connectedDB3;Password=Welcome3;User=admin;
applicationhost :
...
Where:
name specifies the connection name.
providername optionally specifies the data provider type. Migrate to Containers
only supports a value of System.Data.SqlClient .
supports the .NET Framework data provider:
System.Data.SqlClient
System.Data.OleDb
System.Data.Odbc
System.Data.OracleClient
connectionstring specifies the
Connection Strings
used to connect to the data provider.
Edit the connection strings sections
Migrate to Containers automatically copies connection strings detected in the
migrated VM to the migration plan.
Some connection strings might not be detected and should be added by editing
the migration plan as shown preceding. (For example, if the connection
strings are in an encrypted section of the applicationhost.config file).
For guidance on determining which connection strings to add to your migration
plan, see Retrieving Connection Strings at Run Time
in the Microsoft documentation.
Connection string external dependencies
Connection strings can contain dependencies, such as a reference to a file
at or to a Windows user associated with the site.
You can add custom user actions to the migration plan to copy an extra file
in the file system. Manually edit the Dockerfile to add a Windows user.
Connection strings can contain dependencies, such as a reference to an external data source.
These dependencies must be migrated manually to ensure that the migrated container
workload has access to the data source.
The security section
The security sections contain the authentication and authorization subsections.
Windows authentication verifies Active Directory users.
Windows authorization is the mechanism for specifying
which users are allowed which types of access to an IIS website. The access
types are the HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
Similar to connection strings, to set authorization or authentication for all
sites, edit globalIis as in the following example. To set authorization or
authentication for a specific site, edit the site element.
globalIis :
security :
authentication :
windowsAuthentication :
providers :
- NTLM
authorization :
- add :
user:John
access :
role :
- remove :
user:Jane
access : GET
role :
...
Where:
providers specifies the provider of your security protocols.
user species the username.
access species the permissions of the user. The access types are the HTTP
verbs (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
role species a specific permission role.
