Batching guest discovery and data collection
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial walks you through the process of discovering and collecting data
on a batch of VMware virtual machine (VM) instances using the
Migration Center discovery client CLI guest discovery. Large batches of VMs may be difficult
to monitor and troubleshoot. We recommend batching into smaller groups of less
than 1,000.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
Download the mcdc CLI.
Run a VMWare inventory discovery.
Generate a CSV file with all the discovered VMs.
Split the CSV file into multiple CSV files containing a subset of the VMs.
Run guest discovery on all the VMs in a CSV file.
Generate an offline assessment report.
Costs
This tutorial uses on-premises resources and incurs no Google Cloud
costs.
Before you begin
Prepare a Linux machine to install and run the
mcdc CLI. The Linux machine must have the
following minimum requirements:
glibc version 2.25 or later
4 GB RAM and 10 GB disk space
Network connectivity to vCenter and ESX hosts
Ensure that you have a vSphere user with the necessary permissions:
Read privileges to VMs
Read privileges to all the ESX hosts
Guest operation modifications
Guest operation program execution
Guest operation queries
Download the mcdc CLI
Connect to the Linux machine:
ssh MACHINE_IP
Replace MACHINE_IP with the IP address of your Linux machine.
Download the latest version of the mcdc CLI and make it executable:
curl -O "https://mc-release.storage.googleapis.com/mcdc/ $( curl -s https://mc-release.storage.googleapis.com/mcdc/latest ) /mcdc"
chmod +x mcdc
Add the mcdc CLI to your shell path:
PATH = $PATH : ` pwd `
Perform a VMware inventory discovery
Run the inventory discovery:
./mcdc discover vsphere -u USERNAME --url https:// VSPHERE_URL
Replace the following:
USERNAME : your vCenter username
VSPHERE_URL : the URL for your vCenter Server
instance or the vSphere Client
The output of the discover command looks like the following:
[+] Found 528 VMs
Collecting data...
528 / 528 [---------------------------------------------------] 100.00% 5 p/s
[✓] Collection completed.
Generate a CSV file with all the discovered VMs
To generate a CSV file, use the export script from the Migrate to Containers
repository on GitHub.
vms = $( mcdc report --format csv | tail -n +2 | awk -F ',' '{; print $2";"$3";"$4";;;"}' )
printf "%s\n" "Name;Platform VM ID;OS Family;IP;USERNAME;PASSWORD"
printf "%s\n" " $vms "
The script uses the report command to generate a CSV file containing all the
VMs that were discovered in the previous step.
Download the script:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/migrate-to-containers/main/scripts/mcdc/mcdc_discovery_export_guest_tools.sh
chmod +x mcdc_discovery_export_guest_tools.sh
Run the script and save the output to a file:
./mcdc_discovery_export_guest_tools.sh > VMS_CSV_FILE
Replace VMS_CSV_FILE with the name you want for the CSV file.
Split the CSV file into multiple CSV files with a subset of the VMs
To split the large CSV file into smaller CSV files, use the splitter script
from the Migrate to Containers repository on GitHub.
tail -n +2 $1 | split -d -l $num_of_lines - $2
for file in $2 *
do
head -n 1 $1 > tmp_file
cat " $file " >> tmp_file
mv -f tmp_file " $file "
done
Download the script:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/migrate-to-containers/main/scripts/mcdc/csv_splitter.sh
chmod +x csv_splitter.sh
Run the script:
./csv_splitter.sh VMS_CSV_FILE CSV_FILES_PREFIX LINES_PER_FILE VMS_CSV_FILE CSV_FILES_PREFIX
Replace the following:
VMS_CSV_FILE : the input CSV file to split.
CSV_FILES_PREFIX : the prefix for the generated CSV
files.
LINES_PER_FILE : the number of lines per generated
CSV file. The default value is 10 .
The script generates various CSV files.
View the list of generated CSV files:
ls -lrt CSV_FILES_PREFIX *
Run guest discovery on all the VMs in a CSV files
To run the guest discovery for the VMs in a CSV file, use the
collection script from the Migrate to Containers GitHub repository.
Repeat this step for each CSV file generated in the previous step.
url_regex = '^https?://[-A-Za-z0-9\+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-A-Za-z0-9\+&@#/%=~_|]\.[-A-Za-z0-9\+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-A-Za-z0-9\+&@#/%=~_|]$'
read -r -p "CSV file name: " CSV_FILE
if [[ ! -r " $CSV_FILE " ]] ; then
echo "The file $CSV_FILE does not exist or can not be accessed."
exit 1
fi
read -r -p "vSphere URL: " VSPHERE_URL
if ! [[ $VSPHERE_URL = ~ $url_regex ]] ; then
echo "vSphere URL $VSPHERE_URL IS not a valid URL"
exit 1
fi
read -r -p "vSphere username: " VSPHERE_USER
read -r -s -p "vSphere password: " VSPHERE_PASSWORD
echo ""
read -r -p "Default username: " DEFAULT_USER
read -r -s -p "Default password: " DEFAULT_PASSWORD
echo ""
# CSV fields
#NAME;PLATFORM VM ID;OS;IP;USERNAME;PASSWORD
while IFS = ";" read -r vm_name vm_id os ip username password
do
if [ -z " $username " ]
then
username = $DEFAULT_USER
fi
if [ -z " $password " ]
then
password = $DEFAULT_PASSWORD
fi
if [ ! -z " $vm_id " ]
then
# Note that the below only works for VMWare VMs
# vm_id after the last slash if prefixed by vSphere IP
mod_vm_id = $( echo " $vm_id " | sed 's/.*\///' )
mcdc discover vsphere guest --url $VSPHERE_URL -u $VSPHERE_USER -p $VSPHERE_PASSWORD --vm-user $username --vm-password $password $mod_vm_id
else
echo "Skipping VM: $vm_name because it has no VM ID"
fi
done < < ( tail -n +1 $CSV_FILE )
The script uses the discover vsphere guest command to upload and execute the
guest collection script on the VM.
It's best to execute this script in the background and direct the output to a
log file. To do so, you need to create a text file which is passed as input to
the script.
Create the text file:
cat <<EOF >> INPUT_FILE
CSV_FILES_PREFIX CSV_FILE_SUFFIX
VSPHERE_URL
VSPHERE_USER
VSPHERE_PASSWORD
VM_USER
VM_PASSWORD
EOF
Replace the following:
INPUT_FILE : input filename
CSV_FILES_PREFIX : CSV filename prefix
CSV_FILE_SUFFIX : CSV filename suffix
VSPHERE_URL : the URL for your vCenter Server
instance or the vSphere Client
VSPHERE_USER : vCenter username
VSPHERE_PASSWORD : vCenter password
VM_USER : VM username
VM_PASSWORD : VM password
Run the guest collection script:
nohup ./mcdc_collect_vms_guest_tools.sh < INPUT_FILE > /tmp/mcdc.out 2>&1 &
Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each CSV file generated in the previous step.
Generate an offline assessment report
After all the data is collected, you can produce a detailed HTML report:
./mcdc report --format html --full > REPORT_NAME .html
