Debugging an instance
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: This guide is applicable to all runtimes in the flexible environment except for .NET.
You can enable debug mode for a VM. In debug mode, principals who have the
Owner, Editor, and App Engine Admin roles on the project have root access to the
VM. While debug mode is turned on, the automatic rollout of operating system
updates and security patches is disabled. However, the VM is still part of the
load balancer pool, and continues to receive external requests.
Whenever you enable or disable debugging, a "VM instance debugging enable/disable"
event appears in the Google Cloud console and the event will be logged in the VM's
/var/log/syslog.log file.
Important: Any changes you make to the VM while in debug mode are temporary;
you will lose your changes when you disable debug mode. VMs that are being
debugged restart periodically, which can make it difficult to debug long running
tasks.
Enabling and disabling debug mode
You can use gcloud to enable and disable debug mode for an
instance. In order to debug an instance, your role must contain the
appengine.instances.enableDebug permission.
Note: To enable debug mode in the Google Cloud console, you must connect using SSH .
To enable and disable debug mode in gcloud :
Use the gcloud
app instances enable-debug command to debug the VMs for a particular
instance and version, as follows:
gcloud app --project PROJECT-ID instances enable-debug
Replace PROJECT-ID with your own project ID, and follow the prompts to
specify the instance version to debug.
When finished debugging, disable debug mode as follows:
gcloud app --project PROJECT-ID instances disable-debug
Follow the prompts to specify the instance version
When you disable debug mode, the VM is stopped and a new instance of
your app is started, running on a clean, new VM.
Connecting to the instance
Console
Note: If OS Login is enabled
in project metadata, use the gcloud CLI to connect to the
instance.
To connect to an instance in the console:
Visit the Google Cloud console instances page for your project:
Go to the instances page
Click SSH in the far right of the row containing the instance you
want to access:
This puts the instance into debug mode, and opens an SSH session for the
instance in a terminal window.
You can also select different options to start an SSH session from the
drop-down list.
At this point you are in the instance host, which has several
containers running in
it. See Understanding common containers
next for more information about these.
In the terminal window, list the containers running in the instance:
sudo docker ps
The output of the sudo docker ps command lists each
container by row; locate the row that contains your project ID: this is
the container running your code. Note the NAME of this container.
Optionally, list logging information for your application by invoking:
sudo docker logs CONTAINER-NAME
Start a shell in the container that is running your code:
sudo docker exec -it CONTAINER-NAME /bin/bash
When finished debugging, enter exit to exit the container,
then exit again to exit the SSH session.
Disable debugging for your instance to allow it to resume normal
operation.
gcloud
To connect to an instance using gcloud:
With the instance enabled for debugging ,
invoke the command:
gcloud beta app instances --project PROJECT-ID ssh INSTANCE-NAME --service SERVICE --version VERSION
At this point you are in the instance host, which has several
containers running.
See Understanding common containers next for more information about these.
In the terminal window, list the containers running in the instance:
sudo docker ps
The output of the sudo docker ps command lists each
container by row; locate the row that contains your project ID: this is
the container running your code. Note the NAME of this container.
Optionally, list logging information for your application by invoking:
sudo docker logs CONTAINER-NAME
Start a shell in the container that is running your code:
docker exec -it CONTAINER-NAME /bin/bash
When finished debugging, enter exit to exit the container,
then exit again to exit the SSH session.
Disable debugging for your instance to allow it to resume normal
operation.
Understanding common containers
In addition to the container running your application code, your instance may
also have the following containers:
Container and Source Code
Description
cloud-sql
Ensures secure connections to your Cloud SQL instance.
fluentd_logger
Logging agent.
nginx_proxy
Proxies requests to the application.
opentelemetry-collector
Receives, processes, and exports telemetry data.
stackdriver-monitoring-agent
Collects, stores, and monitors system information.
Note that these sidecar containers are subject to change without notice.
