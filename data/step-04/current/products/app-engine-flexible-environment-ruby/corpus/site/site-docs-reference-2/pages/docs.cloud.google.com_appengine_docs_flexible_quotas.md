Region ID
The REGION_ID is an abbreviated code that Google assigns
based on the region you select when you create your app. The code does not
correspond to a country or province, even though some region IDs may appear
similar to commonly used country and province codes. For apps created after
February 2020, REGION_ID .r is included in
App Engine URLs. For existing apps created before this date, the
region ID is optional in the URL.

This document lists the quotas and system limits that apply to
App Engine.
Quotas have default values, but you can typically request
adjustments.
System limits are fixed values that can't be changed.
Google Cloud uses quotas to help ensure fairness and reduce
spikes in resource use and availability. A quota restricts how much of a
Google Cloud resource your Google Cloud project can use. Quotas
apply to a range of resource types, including hardware, software, and network
components. For example, quotas can restrict the number of API calls to a
service, the number of load balancers used concurrently by your project, or the
number of projects that you can create. Quotas protect the community of
Google Cloud users by preventing the overloading of services. Quotas also
help you to manage your own Google Cloud resources.
The Cloud Quotas system does the following:
Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services
Restricts your consumption of those resources
Provides a way to
request changes to the quota value
and automate quota adjustments
In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota
allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that
you're trying to perform fails.
Quotas generally apply at the Google Cloud project
level. Your use of a resource in one project doesn't affect
your available quota in another project. Within a Google Cloud project, quotas
are shared across all applications and IP addresses.
For more information, see the
Cloud Quotas overview .
There are also system limits on App Engine resources.
System limits can't be changed.
An App Engine application can consume resources up to certain quotas.
You can view your application's daily consumption on the Google Cloud console
Quota Details page .
Types of quotas
The following types of quotas apply to App Engine applications:
Free quotas give your application an amount of each resource for free. The
details on free quotas can be found under the resources section on this
page. After your application exceeds a free quota, you will be billed
for any additional use of that resource.
Only the App Engine standard environment provides free quotas.
Daily quotas protect the integrity of the App Engine
system by ensuring that no single app over-consumes a resource to the detriment of other apps.
If you go above these limits, you'll get an error. Daily quotas are refreshed daily at midnight
Pacific time.
Per-minute quotas protect your application from consuming all of its
resources in very short periods of time, and prevent other applications from monopolizing a given
resource. If your application consumes a resource too quickly and depletes a per-minute quota,
the word "Limited" appears next to the appropriate quota on the Quotas page in
the Google Cloud console. Requests for resources that reach their per-minute maximum are denied.
Project owners and billing administrators
can
enable billing for a project.
For details about what happens when a quota is exceeded and how to handle
quota overage conditions, see
When a resource is depleted .
Tip: The maximum per-minute quotas accommodate high
traffic levels, enough to handle a spike in traffic from your site getting
mentioned in news stories. If you believe a particular quota does not meet
this requirement, submit
feedback in the issue tracker . Note that filing feedback is not a
request for increasing your quota, but it will help us understand which quota
is potentially too low for general use
cases. If you're expecting extremely high traffic levels, or for some
reason your app requires particularly high quotas (for example, because of a
significant product launch or large load tests), we recommend that you sign up for a
support package .
How resources are replenished
App Engine tracks your application's resource usage against system quotas.
App Engine resets all resource measurements at the beginning of each calendar day (except
for Stored Data, which always represents the amount of datastore storage in use).
Daily quotas are replenished daily at midnight Pacific time. Per-minute quotas are refreshed
every 60 seconds.
When a resource is depleted
When an application consumes all of an allocated resource, the resource becomes unavailable until
the quota is replenished. This may mean that your application will not work until the quota is
replenished.
For resources that are required to initiate a request, when the resource is
depleted, App Engine by default returns an HTTP 403 or
503 error code for the request instead of calling a request
handler. This behavior applies to the Instance hours
resource.
Tip: You can configure your application to serve a custom error page
when your application exceeds a quota. For details, see the configuration file
reference for Python ( 2.7 , 3 ),
Java ,
Go , PHP ( 5.5 , 7 ), or
Node.js
.
For all other resources, when the resource is depleted, an attempt in the application to consume
the resource results in an exception. This exception can be caught by the application and handled,
such as by displaying a friendly error message to the user. In the Python API, this exception is
apiproxy_errors.OverQuotaError . In the API for Java, this exception is
com.google.apphosting.api.ApiProxy.OverQuotaException . In the Go API, the
appengine.IsOverQuota function reports whether an error represents an API call failure
due to insufficient available quota.
The following example illustrates how to catch the OverQuotaError , which may be
raised by the SendMessage() method if an email-related quota has been exceeded:
try:
mail.SendMessage ( to = 'test@example.com' , from = 'admin@example.com' ,
subject = 'Test Email' , body = 'Testing' )
except apiproxy_errors.OverQuotaError, message:
# Log the error. logging.error(message)
# Display an informative message to the user.
self.response.out.write ( 'The email could not be sent. '
'Please try again later.' )
Is your app exceeding the default limits?
You can contact
Cloud Customer Care to request higher throughput limits. If you need a
higher mail quota, you can use SendGrid to send
email .
Quotas for the App Engine flexible environment
When you deploy an application to the App Engine flexible environment, some Google Cloud
resources are consumed. You might not be able to modify these resources; however, these resources
count against your quota.
For example, you can find your services' instance resource usage
under the Compute Engine Resource quotas page .
Resources
An application may use the following resources, subject to quotas. Resources measured against
billable limits are indicated with "(billable)." Resource amounts represent an allocation over a 24
hour period.
The cost of additional resources is listed on the Pricing page.
Services, versions, and instances
There are limits to the number of services, versions, and instances (for
services with manual scaling) for each application. Both the
standard environment and the flexible environment share the same limits for
services and versions. For example, if you have standard versions and flexible
versions in the same app, those versions count towards the same limit.
Description
Limit
Maximum services per application
210
Maximum versions per application
210 *
Maximum instances per version with manual scaling
20
* Backend services, such as a backend service that is used by an
external HTTP load balancer, can count towards your maximum versions limit.
There is also a limit to the number of characters in the URL of your
application.
Description
Limit
Maximum characters in Project URL for
VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT_ID URL
63
Not all projects have the above limits. As your use of Google Cloud Platform
expands over time, your limits might increase accordingly. If you expect a
notable upcoming increase in usage, you can proactively request adjustments from
the App Engine Quotas page in the
Google Cloud console .
Default Cloud Storage bucket
The Default Cloud Storage bucket has a free quota for daily usage as shown below. You
create this free default bucket in the Google Cloud console
App Engine settings page for your project.
The following quotas apply specifically to use of the default bucket.
See

Firestore in Datastore mode (Datastore)
The Stored Data (billable) quota refers to all data stored for the application in
Datastore and Blobstore. Other quotas in the "Datastore" section of the Quota
Details screen in the Google Cloud console refer specifically to the Datastore service.
Stored data (billable) The total amount of data stored in datastore entities
and corresponding indexes and the Blobstore.
It's important to note that data stored in the datastore may incur significant overhead. This
overhead depends on the number and types of associated properties, and includes space used by
built-in and custom indexes. Each entity stored in the datastore requires the following
metadata:
The entity key, including the kind, the ID or key name, and the keys of the
entity's ancestors.
The name and value of each property. Since the datastore is
schemaless, the name of each property must be stored with the property value for any given
entity.
Any built-in and custom index rows that refer to this entity. Each row contains
the entity kind, any number of property values depending on the index definition, and the entity
key.
Number of indexes
The number of Datastore indexes that exist for the application. This
includes indexes that were created in the past and no longer appear in the
application's configuration but have not been deleted. See the Datastore limits page
for additional details about limits.
Write operations
The total number of Datastore write operations.
Read operations
The total number of Datastore read operations.
Small operations The total number of Datastore small operations. Small
operations include calls to allocate Datastore IDs or keys-only queries.
Resource
Default limit

Small Operations
Unlimited
Note: Datastore operations generated by the Datastore
Admin and Datastore
Viewer count against your application quota.
Deployments
In each App Engine application, you can deploy up to 10,000 times per day.
When you deploy, Cloud Build builds a container image, and stores the image in the
Artifact Registry . You will incur charges if the
total storage space consumed by the images exceeds the
free tier .
Caution: Container Registry is deprecated. Effective March 18, 2025,
Container Registry is shut down, and writing images to Container Registry is unavailable. For
details on the deprecation and how to migrate to Artifact Registry, see
Container Registry deprecation .
Files
The following quota applies to the total number of app deployment files.
Files
Maximum
Default files per app
10,000 files Contact Support to request an increase.
Instance hours
Instance usage is billed by instance uptime, at a given hourly rate.
There are separate free quotas for "F" and "B"
instance classes (also known as
"frontend" and "backend" instance classes). Note that when you use App Engine
Services , the service's instance class determines
which quota applies.
Resource
Free Quota
F1 instances
28 free instance hours per day
B1 instances
9 free instance hours per day
Accrual of instance hours begins when an instance starts and ends as described
below, depending on the
type of scaling
you specify for the instance:
Basic or automatic scaling: accrual ends fifteen minutes after an instance finishes
processing its last request.
Manual scaling: accrual ends fifteen minutes after an instance shuts down.
If the number of idle instances created by App Engine exceeds the maximum you specify
in the Performance Settings tab of the Google Cloud console, the excess instances do not accrue
instance hours.
Important: When you view your bill , you will not see the names of the
individual instance classes in your billing line items. Instead, you see instance hours from the
"B" classes reported as "Backend Instances", and instance hours from the "F" classes reported as
"Frontend Instances". The bill will apply the appropriate multiple of instance hours for each
instance class you use. For example, if you use an F4 instance for one hour, you see
"Frontend Instance" billing for four instance hours at the F1 rate.
Logs
The Logs API is metered when log data is retrieved.
The logs ingestion allotment refers to request logs and application logs data for an
application. Logging for App Engine apps is provided by Google Cloud Observability. See Google Cloud Observability pricing for more information on rates and
limits.
Mail
Mail API consumption is available to view at
the IAM Quotas page .
Note: To view an application's quota consumption on the IAM Quotas page, ensure that the App Engine Reporting Service is enabled for the project. If you can't enable the service, please check your permissions and the constraints/serviceuser.services org policy constraint.
Note: You can follow the steps outlined in this page to request higher limits.
App Engine bills for email use "by message," counting each email
to each recipient. For example, sending one email to ten recipients counts as 10 messages.
Messages sent to non-admins
The total number of messages sent by the application to non-application admins.
Messages sent to admins
The total number of messages to application admins that have been sent by the application.
The total size limit for each admin email, including headers, attachments, and body is 16KB.
Message body data sent
The amount of data sent in the body of email messages.
Attachments sent
The total number of attachments sent with email messages.

If your app needs higher quotas for sending mail, you can use a third-party mail provider, such as
SendGrid ,
Mailjet , or Mailgun .
Memcache
You can view Memcache API consumption on
the IAM Quotas page .
Memcache API consumption is specified in centi Memcache compute units (MCU) , which are 1/100ths of an MCU. You can use up to millions of centi-MCUs.

Requests
Outgoing bandwidth (billable)
The amount of data sent by the application in response to requests.
This includes:
data served in response to both secure requests and non-secure requests by application
servers, static file servers, or the Blobstore
data sent in email messages
data in outgoing HTTP requests sent by the URL fetch service.
Incoming bandwidth
The amount of data received by the application from requests. Each incoming HTTP request can
be no larger than 32MB.
This includes:
data received by the application in secure requests and non-secure requests
uploads to the Blobstore
data received in response to HTTP requests by the URL fetch service
Secure outgoing bandwidth
The amount of data sent by the application over a secure connection in response to requests.
Secure incoming bandwidth
The amount of data received by the application over a secure connection from requests.
Note: Outgoing bandwidth is a billable resource, which
includes HTTP/HTTPS requests. The first 1 GB of outgoing bandwidth
per day is free. There is no daily limit or maximum quota for both outgoing or incoming bandwidth.
Search
Free quotas for Search are listed in the table below. Refer to the
Java ,
Python , and Go
documentation for a detailed description of each type of Search call.
Search API resources are charged according to the rates on the
pricing schedule .
Resource or API call
Free Quota
Total storage (documents and indexes)
0.25 GB
Queries
1000 queries per day
Adding documents to indexes
0.01 GB per day
The application console quota section displays a raw count of API requests.
Note that when indexing multiple documents in a single
call, the call count is increased by the number of documents.
The Search API imposes these limits to ensure the reliability of the service:
100 aggregated minutes of query execution time per minute,
within an app and an index .
15,000 Documents added/deleted per minute
In addition, there is a limit of 10GB storage per
index. When an app tries to exceed this amount, an insufficient quota error is returned.
This limit may be increased to up to 200GB by submitting a request from the
Google Cloud console App Engine Search page.
Note: Although these limits are enforced by the minute,
the Google Cloud console displays the daily totals for each. Customers with
Standard,
Enhanced, or Premium support can request higher throughput limits by contacting
their support representative.
