Create a product set and search for products
This quickstart demonstrates how to create and use the three types of
Vision API Product Search resources: a product set which contains a
group of products , and reference images associated with those products.
In this quickstart you will create a product set, products, and their
reference images in a single step by batch import.
After the product set has been indexed , you can query the product
set using Vision API Product Search.
This quickstart steps you through the process of:
Using a CSV and bulk import to create a product set , products , and
reference images .
Making a request to the Vision API Product Search with an image stored in a
Cloud Storage bucket.
Before you begin
If you haven't done so already, set up your project as explained below.
Set up your project
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Vision API:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable vision.googleapis.com
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/storage.objectViewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.

role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable vision.googleapis.com
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/storage.objectViewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Using a dataset
In this quickstart you use a dataset of ~100 apparel-v2 product category
entries. This publicly available dataset is located in a public
Cloud Storage bucket at:
gs://cloud-samples-data/vision/product_search/product_catalog.csv
The CSV format is as follows:
gs://cloud-ai-vision-data/product-search-tutorial/images/filename1.jpg,image0,product_set0,product_id0,apparel-v2,,"style=women,category=shoe",
gs://cloud-ai-vision-data/product-search-tutorial/images/filename2.jpg,image1,product_set0,product_id1,apparel-v2,,"style=men,category=shoe",
gs://cloud-ai-vision-data/product-search-tutorial/images/filename3.jpg,image2,product_set0,product_id2,apparel-v2,,"style=women,category=dress",
Note: This sample CSV omits the optional columns product-display and
bounding-poly . For more information about CSV requirements, see
the Formatting a bulk import CSV how-to topic.
Use bulk import to create a product set, products, and reference images
Use the following curl command to create a new product set with products and
reference images. This set is named product_set0 , a value declared in
the import CSV.
First create a request JSON file called import_request.json and save it in
your current working directory:
import_request.json
{
"inputConfig": {
"gcsSource": {
"csvFileUri": "gs://cloud-samples-data/vision/product_search/product_catalog.csv"
}
}
}
After creating the request JSON file, send the request:
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-d @import_request.json \
https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /productSets:import
Replace the following:
LOCATION_ID : The location that will run your
tutorial, for example, us-east1 . Valid location identifiers are: us-west1 , us-east1 ,
europe-west1 , and asia-east1
.
A successful response contains a long-running operation object:
{
"name": "locations/ LOCATION_ID /operations/ 0a0aec86192599fa "
}
The response also contains a relative operation ID (for example,
0a0aec86192599fa ) that can be used to get the status of the operation.
Get import operation status
You can use the OPERATION_ID returned from the import operation
to check the status of the bulk import operation:
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/locations/ LOCATION_ID /operations/ OPERATION_ID
A successful response looks like:
{

}
}
Indexing
The Product Search index of products is updated
approximately every day. When images are added or deleted, the change won't be
reflected in your Product Search responses until the index is next updated.
To make sure that indexing has completed successfully, check the
indexTime field
of a product set.
List product sets and check indexing
You can list all your product sets and use the indexTime field to verify that
indexing has completed successfully:
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /productSets
A successful response lists all your product sets, including a product set ID
(for example, product_set0 ) as well as the indexTime field indicating
when indexing completed:
{
"productSets": [
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /productSets/ product_set0 ",
"displayName": " ",
" indexTime ": "2019-11-30T18:33:40.093508652Z",
"indexError": {}
}
]
}
List products
You can use the PRODUCT_SET_ID returned from the list of product sets
to list all products in your product set:
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /productSets/ PRODUCT_SET_ID /products?pageSize=15
A successful response lists product details.
In this request you use the optional query parameter
pageSize to set the result list to 15 products. The
nextPageToken in the response also indicates there are more
products to list. You can use the token listed to retrieve further results. For
more information on using a pageToken , see
Getting and listing resources .

Search for matching products with Vision API Product Search
After indexing is complete, you can search for products that match a sample
image. In this quickstart you use an image stored in a Google
Cloud Storage bucket such as the following image.
Note: You can also search using a
base64 encoded local image. For code samples
using a local image, see Searching for products .
gs://cloud-ai-vision-data/product-search-tutorial/images/468f782e70ba11e8941fd20059124800.jpg
Search using a remote image
Use the following request to search using the image stored in a public
Cloud Storage bucket.
First create a request JSON file called search_request.json and save it in
your current working directory. Change the following values in the request
JSON to match your project's information:
PROJECT_ID
LOCATION_ID
PRODUCT_SET_ID
search_request.json
{
"requests": [
{
"image": {
"source": {
"gcsImageUri": "gs://cloud-ai-vision-data/product-search-tutorial/images/468f782e70ba11e8941fd20059124800.jpg"
}
},
"features": [
{
"type": "PRODUCT_SEARCH"
}
],
"imageContext": {
"productSearchParams": {
"productSet": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /productSets/ PRODUCT_SET_ID ",
"productCategories": [
"apparel-v2"
],
"filter": "style=womens OR style=women"
}
}
}
]
}
After creating the request JSON file, send the request:
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-d @search_request.json \
https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate
A successful request returns a list of matching products, indicated by their
product ID. These results are further broken down by individual products
identified by bounding boxes if there are multiple products in a single image.
For an example of single-product detection and multi-detection of products in an
image, see
Understanding search responses & multi-detection .
A field score is returned as well. This field indicates the
confidence at which the service feels the product matches the supplied image,
on a scale of 0 (no confidence) to 1 (full confidence).
The indexTime field shows which version of the index is being searched. Image
changes made after this time are not reflected in the results.

Clean up
Optional: Revoke credentials from the gcloud CLI.
gcloud auth revoke
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
