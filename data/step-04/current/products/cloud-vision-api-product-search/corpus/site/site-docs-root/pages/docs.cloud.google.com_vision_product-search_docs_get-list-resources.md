Getting and listing resources
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
At any time, you can list and get any product set, product, or reference image
resources you have.
Listing product sets
This section describes how to retrieve a list of all your product sets.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION_ID : A valid location identifier. Valid location identifiers are: us-west1 , us-east1 ,
europe-west1 , and asia-east1 .
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /productSets
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: project-id " \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /productSets"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " project-id " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /productSets" | Select-Object -Expand Content

The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: project-id " \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to

Listing all products in a product set
The following example shows how to list products in a specific product set.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION_ID : A valid location identifier. Valid location identifiers are: us-west1 , us-east1 ,
europe-west1 , and asia-east1 .
PRODUCT_SET_ID : The ID for the product set you want
to run the operation on.
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /productSets/ product-set-id /products
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: project-id " \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /productSets/ product-set-id /products"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " project-id " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /productSets/ product-set-id /products" | Select-Object -Expand Content
If the request is successful, the server returns a 200 OK HTTP status code and the
response in JSON format.
You should see output similar to the following. Note that the number of products returned is
limited to 10 at a time, and a nextPageToken is provided if there are more
pages.

Listing reference images
A product can have multiple associated reference images. The following example
describes how to obtain all reference images linked to a single product.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION_ID : A valid location identifier. Valid location identifiers are: us-west1 , us-east1 ,
europe-west1 , and asia-east1 .
PRODUCT_ID : The ID for the product that is
associated with a reference image. This ID is either randomly set or specified by the user
at product creation time.
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: project-id " \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " project-id " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages" | Select-Object -Expand Content
If the request is successful, the server returns a 200 OK HTTP status code and the
response in JSON format.
You should see output similar to the following. The default number of images returned is
10 at a time, and a nextPageToken is provided if there are more
pages.
The below response is for a product with two reference images. One of these images has
associated bounding box, while the other image does not have a bounding polygon.
Response
{
"referenceImages": [
{
"name": "projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages/ image-id1 ",
"uri": "gs:// storage-bucket / filename1 .jpg",
"boundingPolys": [
{
"normalizedVertices": [

"uri": "gs:// storage-bucket / filename2 .jpg"
}
]
}
If the response contains a nextPageToken , there are more results. You can
repeat the request, adding a pageToken parameter with the value of
nextPageToken (for example, 1LqhSgZfM_uWKOxvog ):

Getting a single reference image
You can also get a single reference image linked to a product.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION_ID : A valid location identifier. Valid location identifiers are: us-west1 , us-east1 ,
europe-west1 , and asia-east1 .
PRODUCT_ID : The ID for the product that is
associated with a reference image. This ID is either randomly set or specified by the user
at product creation time.
IMAGE_ID : The ID of the target image resource.
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages/ image-id
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: project-id " \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages/ image-id "
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " project-id " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages/ image-id " | Select-Object -Expand Content
If the request is successful, the server returns a 200 OK HTTP status code and the
response in JSON format.
You should see output similar to the following. The example reference image has associated
bounding boxes specified.
Response
{
"name": "projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages/ image-id ",
"uri": "gs:// storage-bucket / filename .jpg",
