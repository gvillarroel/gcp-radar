Deleting resources
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can delete reference image, product, or product set resources created by the
API.
Individual resource deletion
Deleting a reference image
You can delete a reference image associated with a product.
After the operation request the images are marked for deletion, but will remain
in the product until the next time it is indexed.
The actual image files in Cloud Storage are NOT deleted by this
operation. Only the reference to the image is removed from the product.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION_ID : A valid location identifier. Valid location identifiers are: us-west1 , us-east1 ,
europe-west1 , and asia-east1 .
PRODUCT_ID : The ID for the product that is
associated with a reference image. This ID is either randomly set or specified by the user
at product creation time.
IMAGE_ID : The ID of the target image resource.
HTTP method and URL:
DELETE https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages/ image-id
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init

.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X DELETE \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: project-id " \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products/ product-id /referenceImages/ image-id "

Deleting a product set
You can also delete a product set.
Deleting a product set immediately removes the product set from results.
However, deleting a product set will not remove individual products in the
set, as a product may belong to several different sets. You do
not need to wait for the next index for the change to take effect.
The actual image files in Cloud Storage are NOT deleted by this
operation. ReferenceImage resources created by the API are not removed.

Batch resource deletion
You can now batch delete products. Product batch deletion is available for the
following product types:
All products in a specific product set
All products that belong to no product set
To avoid concurrent operation errors, wait to delete the product set after
this batch product delete operation has completed. If reusing the emptied
product set, also wait until batch deletion is finished before importing new
products.
These considerations are similar for individual products; you should avoid
acting on any individual products involved in batch deletion. For example, you
shouldn't add any of these products to another product set, as they will
eventually be deleted.
Batch deletion ( purge ) cannot be
undone . You should keep a CSV for batch import with the products to
be deleted if you need to re-import the data.
Delete products in a product set
You can delete all products in a given product set by specifying the product
set ID in the request.
All products in the product set will be deleted regardless of if they belong
to other product sets .
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:

Delete orphan products
You can delete all products not in a product set by specifying this option
in the request.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION_ID : A valid location identifier. Valid location identifiers are: us-west1 , us-east1 ,
europe-west1 , and asia-east1 .
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products:purge
Request JSON body:
{
"force": "true",
"deleteOrphanProducts": "true"
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: project-id " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products:purge"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " project-id " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /products:purge" | Select-Object -Expand Content
This request starts a long-running operation. The JSON response contains information
about this long-running operation:
{
"name": "projects/ project-id /locations/ location-id /operations/ bc4e1d412863e626 "
}
In this case, the operation-id is bc4e1d412863e626 .
You can track the progress of this operation using the operation-id .

Getting the status of an operation
You can use the operation-id of a long-running operation (such as
purge product set, or purge orphan products) to get
its status.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION_ID : A valid location identifier. Valid location identifiers are: us-west1 , us-east1 ,
europe-west1 , and asia-east1 .
OPERATION_ID : The ID of your operation. The ID is the last element of the name
of your operation. For example:
operation name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /operations/ bc4e1d412863e626
operation id: bc4e1d412863e626
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/locations/ location-id /operations/ operation-id
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: project-id " \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/locations/ location-id /operations/ operation-id "
PowerShell

the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
