Certificate Authority Service overview
Certificate Authority Service (CA Service) is a highly scalable
Google Cloud service that lets you simplify and automate the
deployment, management, and security of private certificate authorities (CA).
Private CAs issue digital certificates that include entity identity, issuer identity,
and cryptographic signatures. Private certificates are one of the most common
ways to authenticate users, machines, or services over networks. Private
certificates are often used in DevOps environments to protect
containers, microservices, virtual machines, and service accounts.
Using CA Service, you can do the following:
Create custom root and subordinate CAs.
Define the subject, key algorithm, and location of the CA.
Select a subordinate CA's region independent of its root CA's region.
Create reusable and parameterized templates for common certificate issuance scenarios.
Bring your own root CA and configure other CAs to chain up to the existing root
CA running on-premises or anywhere else outside Google Cloud.
Store your private CA keys using Cloud HSM , which is FIPS
140-2 Level 3 validated and available in several regions across the Americas,
Europe, and Asia Pacific.
Obtain logs and gain visibility into who did what, when, and where with
Cloud Audit Logs .
Define granular access controls with Identity and Access Management (IAM) and
virtual security perimeters with VPC Service Controls .
Manage high volumes of certificates knowing that CA Service
supports issuing up to 25 certificates per second per CA (DevOps tier), which
means that each CA can issue millions of certificates. You can create multiple
CAs behind one issuance endpoint called a CA pool and distribute the incoming
certificate requests across all the CAs. Using this feature, you can effectively
issue up to 100 certificates per second.
Manage, automate, and integrate private CAs in whichever way is most
convenient for you: using APIs, the Google Cloud CLI, the Google Cloud console, or
Terraform .
Certificate use cases
You can use your private CAs to issue certificates for the following use cases:
Software supply chain integrity and code identity : Code signing, artifact
authentication, and application identity certificates.
User identity : Client authentication certificates used as user identity
for zero trust networking, VPN, document signing, email, smartcard, and more.
IoT and mobile device identity : Client authentication certificates used
as device identity and authentication, for example, wireless access.
Intraservice identity : mTLS certificates used by microservices.
Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) channels : Code
signing certificates used throughout the CI/CD build to improve code integrity and
security.
Kubernetes and Istio : Certificates to secure connections between the
Kubernetes and Istio components.
Why choose a private PKI
In a typical Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), millions of clients across the
world trust a set of independent certificate authorities (CAs) to assert identities
(such as domain names) in certificates. As part of their responsibilities, CAs commit
to only issuing certificates when they have independently validated the identity
in that certificate. For example, a CA typically needs to verify that
somebody requesting a certificate for the domain name example.com actually
controls the said domain before they issue a certificate to them. Since those CAs
can issue certificates for millions of customers where they might not have an
existing direct relationship, they are limited to asserting identities that are
publicly verifiable. Those CAs are limited to certain well-defined verification
processes that are consistently applied across the Web PKI.
Unlike Web PKI, a private PKI often involves a smaller CA hierarchy, which is
directly managed by an organization. A private PKI sends certificates only to clients
that inherently trust the organization to have the appropriate controls (for
example, machines owned by that organization). Since the CA admins often have
their own ways of validating identities for which they issue certificates (for
example, issuing certificates to their own employees), they aren't limited by
the same requirements as for Web PKI. This flexibility is one of the main advantages
of private PKI over Web PKI. A private PKI enables new use cases such as securing
internal websites with short domain names without requiring unique ownership of
those names, or encoding alternative identity formats (such
as SPIFFE IDs ) into
a certificate.
In addition, the Web PKI requires all CAs to log every certificate they've
issued to public Certificate Transparency
logs, which may not be required for organizations issuing certificates to their
internal services. Private PKI allows organizations to keep their internal
infrastructure topology, such as the names of their network services or
applications, private from the rest of the world.
