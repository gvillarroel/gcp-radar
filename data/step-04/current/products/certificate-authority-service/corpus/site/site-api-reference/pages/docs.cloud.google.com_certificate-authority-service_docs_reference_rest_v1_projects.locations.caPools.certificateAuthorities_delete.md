Delete a CertificateAuthority .
HTTP request
DELETE https://privateca.googleapis.com/v1/{name=projects/*/locations/*/caPools/*/certificateAuthorities/*}
The URL uses gRPC Transcoding syntax.
Path parameters
Parameters
name
string
Required. The resource name for this CertificateAuthority in the format projects/*/locations/*/caPools/*/certificateAuthorities/* .
Authorization requires the following IAM permission on the specified resource name :
privateca.certificateAuthorities.delete
Query parameters
Parameters
requestId
string
Optional. An ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.
For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
ignoreActiveCertificates
boolean
Optional. This field allows the CA to be deleted even if the CA has active certs. Active certs include both unrevoked and unexpired certs.
skipGracePeriod
boolean
Optional. If this flag is set, the Certificate Authority will be deleted as soon as possible without a 30-day grace period where undeletion would have been allowed. If you proceed, there will be no way to recover this CA.
ignoreDependentResources
boolean
Optional. This field allows this CA to be deleted even if it's being depended on by another resource. However, doing so may result in unintended and unrecoverable effects on any dependent resources since the CA will no longer be able to issue certificates.
Request body
The request body must be empty.
Response body
If successful, the response body contains an instance of Operation .
Authorization scopes
Requires the following OAuth scope:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
