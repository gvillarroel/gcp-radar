Issue certificates that attest to third-party identity
This tutorial demonstrates how you can issue certificates that attest to a
third-party identity using
identity reflection
and workload identity pools .
You can use identity reflection to create certificates that match the verified
identity of a certificate requester. Using identity reflection, you can limit an
unprivileged certificate requester to requesting only certificates with a
subject alternative name (SAN) corresponding to the identity in their
credential.
Objectives
This tutorial provides information about how you can use CA Service
with workload identity pools to federate a third-party identity and obtain a
certificate that attests to this identity.
Before you begin
Before you begin, make sure that you understand the following concepts:
Workload identity pools : Workload identity pools let you manage third-party
identity providers. For more information, see
Manage workload identity pools and providers .
Workload identity federation : Workload identity federation leverages
workload identity pools to give third-party identities access to Google Cloud
services. For more information, see Workload identity
federation .
Security Token Service (STS) : The Security Token Service lets you exchange
third-party credentials for first-party (Google Cloud) tokens. For more
information, see Security Token Service .
Identity reflection : The identity reflection feature lets the verified
identity of a certificate requester go on to the requested certificate. For
more information, see Identity
reflection .
Make sure that you have the following IAM
roles :
Note: Grant the following IAM roles with caution. The permissions
associated with the following roles grant access to security critical
Google Cloud controls. If you plan to use the same project later for production,
we recommend reviewing these permissions again and reducing access wherever
possible.
To manage certificate authorities (CAs) and CA pools , and request
certificates, you must have the CA Service Operation Manager
( privateca.caManager ) role. For more information about IAM
roles for CA Service, see
Access control with IAM .
To manage workload identity pools and providers, you must have the
Workload Identity Pool Admin ( iam.workloadIdentityPoolAdmin ) role.
To create a service account, you must have the Service Account Admin
( iam.serviceAccountAdmin ) role.
For information about granting IAM roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and
organizations . You can grant the
required IAM roles to a Google Account, a service account, a
Google group, a Google Workspace account, or a Cloud Identity domain.
Set up a workload identity pool and provider
This tutorial explains how you can use a Google OpenID Connect (OIDC)
provider combined with a service account to act as a third-party identity. The
Google Accounts OIDC provider acts as a third-party identity provider (IDP) and
the Google Cloud service account is a sample third-party identity asserted by this IDP.
Workload identity pools support a variety of identity providers,
including Microsoft Azure/On-premises Active Directory, AWS, and SAML-based
identity providers.
To set up a workload identity pool and provider, do the following:
To represent a trusted set of federated identities, create a workload
identity pool:
gcloud iam workload - identity - pools create IDENTITY_POOL_ID -- location global -- display - name "tutorial-wip"
Replace the following:
IDENTITY_POOL_ID : The unique identifier of the new workload
identity pool.
Create a workload identity pool provider for your third-party identity
provider:
gcloud iam workload - identity - pools providers create - oidc PROVIDER_ID -- location global -- workload - identity - pool IDENTITY_POOL_ID -- display - name "tutorial-oidc" -- attribute - mapping "google.subject=assertion.sub" -- issuer - uri = "https://accounts.google.com"
Replace the following:
PROVIDER_ID : The unique identifier of the identity provider
that you want to create in the workload identity pool.
You can customize the following flags to your use case:
attribute-mapping : This flag sets the mapping between the third-party
claims to the Google principal claim, google.subject . google.subject
is a required mapping that you can set to any claims or combination of
claims using a CEL
expression. For more information, see Define an attribute mapping and
condition .
issuer-uri : For OIDC providers, this flag is a publicly accessible
endpoint that Google reaches out to for verification of third-party
tokens. For more information, see Preparing an external identity
provider .
For more information about setting up a workload identity
provider, see Configuring workload identity
federation .
Create a CA pool and an issuing CA
This section explains how you can create a CA pool and add a root
CA to it. You can use this CA pool to issue identity-reflected
certificates. If you want to use an existing CA pool and CA, you can skip this
section.
Instead of a root CA, you can also choose to create a subordinate CA. Creating
a root CA helps shorten the procedure.
Create a CA pool in the DevOps tier :
gcloud privateca pools create CA_POOL_ID --location LOCATION --tier devops
Replace the following:
CA_POOL_ID - The ID of the CA Service CA pool that
issues certificates.
LOCATION - The location of the CA pool.
For more information about creating CA pools, see
Create a CA pool .
Create a root CA:
gcloud privateca roots create CA_ID --pool CA_POOL_ID --location LOCATION --subject "CN=test,O=test-org"
Replace the following:
CA_ID - The ID of certificate authority that issues certificates.
CA_POOL_ID - The ID of the CA Service CA pool that
issues certificates.
LOCATION - The location of the CA pool.
For more information about creating a root CA, see
Create a root CA .
Enable identities federated from the workload identity pool to issue
certificates from the CA Pool. Identity reflection requires the
CA Service Workload Certificate Requester
( roles/privateca.workloadCertificateRequester ) IAM role for
the requesters of CreateCertificate .
You can represent workload identity pool principals in various granularities,
ranging from a single subject to all identities in the pool across providers.
For more information, see the principals or principal sets that are available (use the Google Cloud CLI tab) to best suit your use case.
Note: You don't need to impersonate a service account to reach out to
CA Service.
gcloud privateca pools add - iam - policy - binding CA_POOL_ID -- location LOCATION -- role roles / privateca . workloadCertificateRequester -- member "principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ IDENTITY_POOL_ID /*"
Replace the following:
CA_POOL_ID : The ID of the CA Service CA pool that
issues certificates.
LOCATION : The location of the CA pool.
PROJECT_NUMBER : The project number of the project in which you created the workload identity pool.
IDENTITY_POOL_ID : The unique identifier of the new workload identity pool.
Create a service account that represents a third-party identity
The following procedure assumes that a service account represents a
third-party. This section shows how you can use the
GenerateIdToken
IAM endpoint to retrieve a third-party identity in the form of
an OIDC token. Depending on your use case, you might need different steps to
obtain the third-party identity token of your choosing.
gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT - The ID of the service account that represents the
third-party identity.
Issue a certificate attesting to a third-party identity
Before you begin, make sure that you have the Service Account Token Creator
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) IAM role. You need this
IAM role to call the GenerateIdToken API.
To obtain a certificate that attests to a third-party identity, do the
following:
Obtain a third-party identity token from your third-party identity provider.
curl
Note: To perform this command, you need the python3
CLI.
export ID_TOKEN=`curl -d '{"audience":"//iam.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ IDENTITY_POOL_ID /providers/ PROVIDER_ID "}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com:generateIdToken | python3 -c "import sys;import json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['token'])"`
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID - The Google Cloud project id for the project you
want to create resources in.
Client libraries
Note: This flow requires the Python-based client libraries for
CA Service. For information about installing the Python-based
client libraries, see Python client for
CA Service
To access the third-party token programmatically, you can obtain a token from a
file-sourced credential or a url-sourced credential. For more information,
see Authenticating by using client libraries, the gcloud CLI,
or Terraform .
In this tutorial, we follow a file-source credential workflow.
Load your credential into a path readable by your certificate
requester:
curl - d '{"audience":"//iam.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ IDENTITY_POOL_ID /providers/ PROVIDER_ID "}' - H 'Content-Type: application/json' - H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" https : // iamcredentials . googleapis . com / v1 / projects /-/ serviceAccounts / SERVICE_ACCOUNT @ PROJECT_ID . iam.gserviceaccount.com : generateIdToken | python3 - c "import sys;import json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['token']) > /tmp/oidc_token.txt
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The project ID of the project you
want to create resources in.
Exchange your third-party token for a federated OAuth token using the STS
token endpoint:
curl
export STS_TOKEN=`curl -L -X POST 'https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"grant_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange",
"audience": "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ IDENTITY_POOL_ID /providers/ PROVIDER_ID ",
"requested_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token",
"scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform",
"subject_token": "'$ID_TOKEN'",
"subject_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt"
}' | python3 -c "import sys;import json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])"`
Client libraries
Create a credential
configuration file named oidc_token.txt that the certificate
requesting code can read to perform a token exchange.
gcloud iam workload - identity - pools create - cred - config projects / PROJECT_NUMBER / locations / global / workloadIdentityPools / IDENTITY_POOL_ID -- output - file =/ tmp / cred_config . json -- credential - source - file =/ tmp / oidc_token . txt
Read the oidc_token.txt file to set the authorization mechanism in the client
library:
python
import json
from google.auth import identity_pool
with open ( '/tmp/cred_config.json' , 'r' ) as f :
json_config_info = json . loads ( f . read ())
credentials = identity_pool . Credentials . from_info ( json_config_info )
scoped_credentials = credentials . with_scopes (
[ 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform' ])
Make a request to CA Service with the
REFLECTED_SPIFFE subject request mode:
curl
Optional: If you don't have a CSR, create a CSR by executing the
following command.
Note: The following command creates a CSR with no subject.
CA Service will add a subject that reflects the certificate requester's
identity.
export TUTORIAL_CSR=$(openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -subj / -keyout tutorial_do_not_use.key)
Request a certificate with the CSR, a lifetime, and a reflected
subject request mode:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(echo $STS_TOKEN)" https://privateca.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/ CA_POOL_ID /certificates\?alt\=json -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H 'Accept: application/json' --data '{"lifetime": "100s", "pemCsr": "'$TUTORIAL_CSR'", "subjectMode": "REFLECTED_SPIFFE"}'
Client libraries
To forward the first-party token to CA Service, you must
create a credentialed client. You can then use this credentialed client
to make certificate requests:
Initiate a credentialed CA Service client:
python
caServiceClient = privateca_v1.CertificateAuthorityServiceClient(credentials=scoped_credentials)
Request a certificate.
Note: Make sure to update the caServiceClient variable in the
following example to use the credentialed version described in the
previous step.
Python
To authenticate to CA Service, set up Application Default Credentials.

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the
CA Service resources you created following this document, perform
the following operations using the Google Cloud CLI:
Delete the CA you created.
Disable the CA:
gcloud privateca roots disable CA_ID --pool CA_POOL_ID --location LOCATION
Replace:
CA_ID : The unique identifier of the CA.
CA_POOL_ID : The unique identifier of the CA pool.
LOCATION : The location of the CA pool.
Delete the CA:
gcloud privateca roots delete CA_ID --pool CA_POOL_ID --location LOCATION --ignore-active-certificates
Replace:
CA_ID : The unique identifier of the CA.
CA_POOL_ID : The unique identifier of the CA pool.
LOCATION : The location of the CA pool.
Delete the CA pool you created.
Note: You can't delete a CA pool until you have permanently deleted all the
CAs within it. The default expiration time of a CA is 30 days.
gcloud privateca pools delete CA_POOL_ID --location LOCATION
Replace:
CA_POOL_ID : The unique identifier of the CA pool.
LOCATION : The location of the CA pool.
For more information about the gcloud privateca pools delete command, see
gcloud privateca pools delete .
Delete the workload identity pool you created:
gcloud iam workload - identity - pools delete IDENTITY_POOL_ID -- location global
Replace:
IDENTITY_POOL_ID : The unique identifier of the workload
identity pool.
Delete the service account that you created:
gcloud iam service - accounts delete SERVICE_ACCOUNT @ PROJECT_ID . iam.gserviceaccount.com
Replace:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT : The unique identifier of the workload
identity pool.
PROJECT_ID : The project that owns the service account.
The CA Service Workload
Certificate Requester ( privateca.workloadCertificateRequester )
IAM role restricts the subject of the issued certificate to only
the identity of the requester. Ensure that users or workloads using the identity
reflection feature are only granted the CA Service
Workload Certificate Requester ( privateca.workloadCertificateRequester )
IAM role. To abide by the principle of least privilege, you can
avoid granting the CA Service Certificate Requester
( privateca.certificateRequester ) IAM role.
