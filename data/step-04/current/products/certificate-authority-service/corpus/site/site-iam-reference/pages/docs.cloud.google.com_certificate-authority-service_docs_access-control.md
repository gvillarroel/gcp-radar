Access control with IAM
This page describes the IAM roles for Certificate Authority Service.
CA Service uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles
for access control. With IAM, you control access by defining who
(identity) has what access (role) for which resource. IAM roles
contain a set of permissions that lets users perform specific actions on Google Cloud
resources. By following the principle of least privilege while granting IAM
roles, you can protect the integrity of Certificate Authority Service resources and manage
the security of the CA pool, and of the overall public key infrastructure (PKI)
itself.
To learn how to assign IAM roles to a user or service account,
read Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources
in the IAM documentation.
Predefined roles
The following table lists the predefined IAM roles and the permissions associated with each of them:
Role
Permissions
Description
CA Service Auditor roles/privateca.auditor
privateca.caPools.get
privateca.caPools.getIamPolicy
privateca.caPools.list
privateca.certificateAuthorities.list
privateca.certificateAuthorities.get

privateca.operations.list
privateca.certificateRevocationLists.list
privateca.certificateRevocationLists.get
privateca.certificateRevocationLists.getIamPolicy
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
The CA Service Auditor role has read-only access to all CA Service resources, and can retrieve and list properties of the CA pool, CA, certificates, revocation lists, IAM policies, and projects. We recommend that you assign this role to individuals who are accountable for validating security and operations of the CA pool, and don't have any daily responsibilities assigned to administer the service.
CA Service Certificate Requester roles/privateca.certificateRequester
privateca.certificates.create
A CA Service Certificate Requester role can submit certificate requests to a CA pool. We recommend that you grant this role to trusted individuals who are allowed to request certificates. A user with this role can request arbitrary certificates subject to the issuance policy. Unlike the CA Service Certificate Manager role, this role does not allow the user to get or list the newly issued certificate, or to get any information about the CA pool.
CA Service Workload Certificate Requester roles/privateca.workloadCertificateRequester
privateca.certificates.createForSelf
A CA Service Workload Certificate Requester can request certificates from CA Service with caller's identity.
CA Service Certificate Manager roles/privateca.certificateManager
All permissions from roles/privateca.auditor , plus:
privateca.certificates.create
A CA Service Certificate Manager can submit certificate issuance requests to a CA pool like the CA Service Certificate Requester. In addition, this role also inherits the permissions of the CA Service Auditor role. We recommend that you assign this role to individuals accountable for creating, tracking, and reviewing certificate requests on a CA pool, such as a manager or a lead engineer.
CA Service Certificate Template User roles/privateca.templateUser
privateca.certificateTemplates.get
privateca.certificateTemplates.list
privateca.certificateTemplates.use
A CA Service Certificate Template User can read, list, and use certificate templates.
CA Service Operation Manager roles/privateca.caManager
All permissions from roles/privateca.auditor , plus:
privateca.certificates.update
privateca.caPools.create
privateca.caPools.delete
privateca.caPools.update
privateca.certificateAuthorities.create
privateca.certificateAuthorities.delete
privateca.certificateAuthorities.update
privateca.certificateRevocationLists.update
privateca.certificateTemplates.create
privateca.certificateTemplates.delete
privateca.certificateTemplates.update
privateca.certificates.update
privateca.operations.cancel
privateca.operations.delete
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
storage.buckets.create
A CA Service Operation Manager can create, update, and delete CA pools and CAs. This role can also revoke certificates and create Cloud Storage buckets. It also includes the same abilities as the CA Service Auditor. In this role, individuals are responsible for configuring and deploying CA pools in the organization, along with configuring the CA pool's issuance policy. This role does not allow creating certificates. To do that, use the CA Service Certificate Requester, CA Service Certificate Manager, or CA Service Admin roles.
CA Service Pool Reader roles/privateca.poolReader
privateca.caPools.get
A user with the CA Service Pool Reader role can read CA pools in CA Service.
CA Service Admin roles/privateca.admin
All permissions from roles/privateca.certificateManager ,
and roles/privateca.caManager , plus:
privateca.*.setIamPolicy
privateca.caPools.use
privateca.operations.cancel
privateca.operations.delete
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
storage.buckets.create
The CA Service Admin role inherits permissions from the CA Service Operation Manager and CA Service Certificate Manager roles. This role can perform all actions within CA Service. A CA Service Admin can set IAM policies for the CA pool and create Cloud Storage buckets. We recommend that you rarely assign this role once the service is established. In this role, individuals can perform all aspects of administration including assigning rights to others and managing certificate requests in CA Service. We recommend that you implement a special control and access to this role account to prevent unauthorized access or use.
CA Service Service Agent role
When providing existing Cloud KMS keys or
Cloud Storage buckets, the CA Service
Service Agent service account
( service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-privateca.iam.gserviceaccount.com ) must be
granted access to the respective resource.
For Cloud KMS, roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier is required to use the
signing key and read the public key. roles/viewer is required to monitor
the key for Cloud Monitoring integration.
For Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) used for encrypting data at rest,
the role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter is required. This allows
the service agent to encrypt and decrypt data at rest.
For Cloud Storage, roles/storage.objectAdmin is required to write the
CA certificate and CRLs to a bucket. roles/storage.legacyBucketReader is
required to monitor the bucket for Cloud Monitoring integration. For more
information, see IAM roles for Cloud Storage .
Note: When accessing the service through the Google Cloud CLI or
Google Cloud console, these roles are automatically bound during CA pool creation.
When accessing the service through the API, execute the following commands.
Create a service account with the Service Agent role.
gcloud
gcloud beta services identity create --service = privateca.googleapis.com --project = PROJECT_ID
Where:
PROJECT_ID is the unique identifier of the project where the CA pool is created.
Grant your service account the required roles by using the following gcloud command.
If existing Cloud KMS keys are provided:
gcloud
For Cloud KMS signing keys:
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding ' KEY_NAME ' \
--keyring = ' KEYRING_NAME ' \
--location = ' LOCATION ' \
--member = 'serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-privateca.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--role = 'roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier'
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding ' KEY_NAME ' \
--keyring = ' KEYRING_NAME ' \
--location = ' LOCATION ' \
--member = 'serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-privateca.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--role = 'roles/viewer'
For Cloud KMS encryption keys:
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding ' KEY_NAME ' \
--keyring = ' KEYRING_NAME ' \
--location = ' LOCATION ' \
--member = 'serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-privateca.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--role = 'roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter'
Where:
' KEY_NAME ' is the name of your key.
' KEYRING_NAME ' is the name of your key ring.
' LOCATION ' is the Cloud KMS location where you created your key ring.
' PROJECT_NUMBER ' is project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the key.
Grant your service account roles/storage.objectAdmin and
roles/storage.legacyBucketReader roles by using the following gcloud
command.
If existing Cloud Storage buckets are provided:
gcloud
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// BUCKET_NAME \
--member = serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-privateca.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/storage.objectAdmin
Where:
BUCKET_NAME is the name of your Cloud Storage bucket.
PROJECT_NUMBER is the unique identifier of your service account.
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// BUCKET_NAME \
--member = serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-privateca.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/storage.legacyBucketReader
