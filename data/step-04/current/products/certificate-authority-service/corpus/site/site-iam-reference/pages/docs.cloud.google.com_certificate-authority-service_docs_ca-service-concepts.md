Certificate Authority Service concepts
This page explains some of the key concepts in Certificate Authority Service (CA Service).
Resources
CA Service consists of the following resources:
Certificate authority pool
A certificate authority pool (CA pool) is the primary resource in
CA Service. A CA pool is the container for certificate
authorities and certificates. Identity and Access Management
conditions, issuance policies, and other configurations are set on the CA pool.
Certificate issuance also occurs through the CA pool, which distributes the certificate
request load across the CAs in the CA pool.
Certificate authority
A certificate authority (CA) resource represents the individual certificate
authority that is used to sign certificates. In CA Service, you
can create both root CAs and subordinate CAs. The root CA has a self-signed
certificate and is at the top of the certificate chain. For a subordinate CA,
the signer of the CA certificate could either be another CA created in
CA Service or an external CA. In the latter case, CA Service
generates a certificate signing request (CSR) that must be signed by the external
CA. You can use either the Google Cloud CLI or the Google Cloud console
to activate the new CA by uploading the signed PEM-encoded certificate chain.
Certificate
A certificate is a signed X.509 certificate issued by the certificate
authority.
Certificate revocation list
A certificate revocation list (CRL) contains the serial numbers of certificates
that have been revoked and should no longer be trusted. CRLs exist as a cloud
resource nested under CAs, but can also be published in PEM or DER encodings to a
Cloud Storage bucket with a publicly-accessible HTTP-based URL.
Certificate template
A certificate template is a top-level resource that defines a distinct
certificate issuance scenario. Certificates issued using a certificate template
inherit pre-configured X.509 extensions like key usage and path length
restrictions from the certificate template. A certificate template lets you
define which extensions to keep and which ones to ignore from a certificate
request. You can use certificate templates to define identity constraints to
limit certificate identities. A certificate template can be used with one or
more CA pools.
CA signing keys
CA Service is automatically configured to use Cloud Key Management Service
for generating, storing, and utilizing CA signing keys. In CA Service,
a Cloud KMS key version is used to sign certificates and CRLs. You can create
your own Cloud KMS key and subsequently create a CA which uses this key. Or you
can specify the algorithm of the Cloud KMS key that you want to use for a CA,
and CA Service will create and configure this key on your behalf.
Cloud KMS keys can either be software or hardware backed. When CA Service
creates the key on your behalf, it always creates a hardware-backed key.
Cloud Storage buckets
CAs created in CA Service publish their artifacts such as CA certificates
and CRLs in a Cloud Storage bucket in the same location as the deployed CA.
Similar to the Cloud KMS keys, the Cloud Storage buckets can either be a
Google-managed resource or a customer-managed resource.
CA tier
The tier of a certificate authority indicates its supported features and
billing SKU. CA Service provides the following two operational
service tiers for each CA pool created:
DevOps: Provides issuance of certificates at a higher certificate
issuance rate or throughput, which is helpful in high-volume scenarios.
Certificates issued by DevOps CAs are not tracked in the CA database
and subsequently can't be revoked. DevOps CAs only support Google-owned and Google-managed encryption keys.
They don't support customer-managed Cloud KMS keys.
Enterprise: Provides a lower certificate issuance throughput but supports
CA operations such as tracking certificates and revoking certificates. This makes the CAs
in this tier better suited for long-lived certificate issuance. Enterprise CAs
support both customer-managed Cloud KMS signing keys and Google-owned and Google-managed encryption keys.
Policy controls
Policy controls let you control the type of certificates that your CA pool can
issue. Policy controls are one of two types:
Coarse-grained policy controls such as issuance policies. A certificate issuance
policy defines the types of certificates that the CAs in that CA pool can issue.
For example, a user could restrict that their CA pool can only issue certificates
that have the correct extended key usage fields set for client TLS, and that it
cannot issue CA certificates.
Fine-grained policy controls represented using templates that determine the
operations that a particular user can perform on a CA pool. Certificate templates
can be used in conjunction with IAM conditions to effectively
create different policy controls for different users on the same CA pool.
You can enforce policy controls in CA Service in the following ways:
Adding a baseline for certificate issuance from an entire CA pool.
Using reusable and parameterized templates for common issuance scenarios.
Enforcing fine-grained control over IAM bindings with conditions.
Simplifying workload certificate provisioning using
identity reflection .
