Create a certificate template
This page describes the attributes of a certificate template and explains how you
can create a certificate template. To learn more about certificate templates,
see About certificate templates .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create a certificate template,
ask your administrator to grant you the
CA Service Operation Manager ( roles/privateca.caManager )
IAM role on the project, folder, or organization.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create a certificate template
To create a certificate template, use one of the following methods:
Console
Go to the Certificate Authority Service page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Certificate Authority Service
Click the Template manager tab, and then click Create template .
Select a location for the certificate template using the Region list. This
must be the same location as the CA pool that you intend to use with
the certificate template.
Enter a unique identifier for the certificate template in the Certificate template ID
field. Optionally, provide a description for the certificate template.
Click Next .
If you want to configure default x.509 values for certificates that use this
template, click the
Include predefined values in certificates issued using this certificate template
toggle. Then, click Configure predefined values .
Set up the predefined values using the following information:
Define base key usage
This setting refers to the Key Usage field within a digital
certificate. It specifies how the certificate's private key can be used,
such as for key encipherment, data encipherment, certificate signing, and CRL signing.
For more information, see Key usage .
To select the base key usages, click the Specify base key usages for certificates issued from this CA pool toggle,
and then select from the options listed.
Click Next .
Define extended key usage
This setting refers to the Extended Key Usage (EKU) field in a digital
certificate. It provides more specific and refined restrictions on how the key
can be used such as for server authentication, client authentication, code signing, email
protection, and more. For more information, see
Extended key usage .
Extended key usages are defined using object identifiers (OIDs). If you don't
configure the extended key usages, all key usage scenarios are allowed.
To select the extended key usages, click the Write extended key usages for
certificates issued from this CA pool toggle, and then select from the options
listed.
Click Next .
Define policy identifiers
The certificate policies extension in the certificate expresses the policies
that the issuing CA pool follows. This extension can include information about how
identities are validated before certificate issuance, how certificates are
revoked, and how the CA pool's integrity is ensured. This extension helps you
verify the certificates that the CA pool issues and see how the certificates
are used.
For more information, see Certificate policies .
To specify the policy that defines the certificate usage, do the following:
Optional: Add the policy identifier in the Policy identifiers field.
Click Next .
Add Authority information access (AIA) OCSP servers
The AIA extension in a certificate provides the following information:
Address of the OCSP servers from where you can check the revocation status
of the certificate.
The access method for the issuer of the certificate.
For more information, see Authority information access .
Adding OCSP servers is optional. To add the OCSP servers that appear in
the AIA extension field in the certificates, do the following:
Click Add item .
In the Server URL field, add the URL of the OCSP server.
Click Done .
Click Next .
CA options
The CA options field within a certificate template defines how the
resulting certificate can be used in a Certificate Authority (CA) hierarchy.
It essentially determines if a certificate can be used to sign other certificates,
and if so, any restrictions on the certificates it issues.
Choose from the following options:
Include the configs to describe the CA X.509 extensions : Specify
the settings within a certificate template that control the X.509 extensions.
Restrict issued certificates to be used only for CAs : This option
appears only if you select the checkbox mentioned in the previous step. This
boolean value indicates whether the certificate is a CA certificate.
If set to true , the certificate can be used to sign other certificates. If
false , it's an end-entity certificate and cannot sign other certificates.
If you click this toggle, you are further prompted to define name constraints
for the extension in CA certificates.
Include the configs to describe the path length restriction X.509 extensions :
Specify the settings that control how long a chain of certificates can be,
stemming from a particular certificate.It specifies the maximum number of CAs
that can be chained up to this CA certificate. If the max issuer path length
is set to 0 , then the CA can only issue end-entity certificates. If it's
set to 1 , then the chain beneath this CA certificate can include only one
subordinate CA. If a value isn't declared, then the number of subordinate CAs
in the chain beneath this CA is unbounded.
Click Next .
Configure additional extensions
Optional: You can configure additional custom extensions to include in the
certificates issued by the CA pool. Do the following:
Click Add item .
In the Object identifier field, add a valid object identifier that
is formatted as dot-separated digits.
In the Value field, add the base64-encoded value for the identifier.
If the extension is critical, select Extension is critical .
To save all the predefined values, click Done .
Next, go to the Configure extension constraints section. Select any one of the following options:
Copy all the extensions from certificate requests to the certificate
Drop all extensions from certificate requests
Copy specific extensions from certificate requests to the certificate
If you choose to copy specific extensions, you can do the following:
Click the Known certificate extensions field, and clear the unrequired extensions from the list.
In the Custom extensions field, add the object identifiers for extensions you want to be included in the certificates that the CA pool issues.
Click Next , and go to the Configure identity constraints section.
To configure constraints on the subject and SANs in the certificates that the
CA pool issues, select one or both of the following options:
Copy subject from the certificate requests to the certificate
Copy subject alternative names (SAN) from the certificate requests to the certificate
Optional: In the Configure identity constraints section, add a Common Expression Language (CEL) expression to define restrictions on certificate subjects. For more information, see Using CEL .
Click Next , and then click, Done .
gcloud
gcloud privateca templates create TEMPLATE_ID \
--copy-subject \
--copy-sans \
--identity-cel-expression <expr> \
--predefined-values-file FILE_PATH \
--copy-all-requested-extensions \
--copy-extensions-by-oid <1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8> \
--copy-known-extensions <ext1,ext2>
Replace the following:
TEMPLATE_ID : the unique identifier of the certificate template.
FILE_PATH : the YAML file that describes the X.509 values set by the certificate template.
The --copy-sans flag allows the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension from the certificate request to be copied into the signed certificate. You can alternatively specify --no-copy-sans to drop any caller specified SANs from the certificate request.
The --copy-subject flag allows the Subject from the certificate request to be copied into the signed certificate. You can alternatively specify --no-copy-subject to drop any caller specified subjects from the certificate request.
Note: If you want to ensure that a template must be used with identity
reflection, specify the --no-copy-subject and --no-copy-sans flags
together. For more information about identity reflection, see
Identity reflection .
The --identity-cel-expression flag takes a CEL expression that is evaluated against the Subject and Subject Alternative Name of the certificate before it is issued, and returns a boolean signifying whether the request should be allowed. For information about using a Common Expression Language (CEL) expression for a certificate template, see Using CEL for certificate templates .
The --predefined-values-file flag specifies the path to a YAML file describing any predefined X.509 values set by this template. The provided extensions are copied over to any certificate requests that use this template, taking precedence over any allowed extensions in the certificate request. If you update any part of the predefined X.509 values, the update replaces the entire set of the predefined X.509 values.
If the --copy-all-requested-extensions flag is set, all the extensions specified in the certificate request are copied into the signed certificate.
If the --copy-extensions-by-oid flag is set, specific OIDs are copied from the
certificate request into the signed certificate.
If the --copy-known-extensions flag is set, specific extensions are copied from
the certificate request into the signed certificate. These known extensions
can be one of the following: base-key-usage , extended-key-usage , ca-options , policy-ids ,
or aia-ocsp-servers .
Note: The tag --copy-all-requested-extensions flag is mutually exclusive from --copy-known-extensions and --copy-extensions-by-oid flags.
Remove the --copy-all-requested-extensions flag to ignore all X.509 extensions in the certificate request, but still keep predefined values defined in this template.
Note: If you delete resources such as CA pools, certificate authorities, and
certificate templates, you will not be able to create a new resource of that
type with the same name in the same project and location.
Here's a sample certificate template configuration:
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
digitalSignature : true
keyEncipherment : true
contentCommitment : false
dataEncipherment : false
keyAgreement : false
certSign : false
crlSign : false
encipherOnly : false
decipherOnly : false
extendedKeyUsage :
serverAuth : true
clientAuth : false
codeSigning : false
emailProtection : false
timeStamping : false
ocspSigning : false
caOptions :
isCa : true
maxIssuerPathLength : 1
policyIds :
- objectIdPath :
- 1
- 2
- 3
additionalExtensions :
- objectId :
objectIdPath :
- 1
- 2
- 3
critical : false
value : "base64 encoded extension value"
Values not specified in the YAML are either omitted or defaulted to false .
The following extensions are omitted if a value isn't specified:
keyUsage
policyIds
additionalExtensions
maxIssuerPathLength field in the caOptions extension
The following extensions default to false if a value isn't specified:
isCa field in the caOptions extension
Create a certificate template for common scenarios
This section provides gcloud commands for creating a certificate template for common use cases.
DNS server TLS certificates for any domain
To create a certificate template for issuing server TLS certificates that allow
any domain, use the following instructions:
Create a file with the name leaf_server_tls_values.yaml and add the following end-entity server TLS configuration to it:
leaf_server_tls_values.yaml
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
digitalSignature : true
keyEncipherment : true
extendedKeyUsage :
serverAuth : true
caOptions :
isCa : false
To only allow certificates with DNS -type SANs, execute following gcloud command:
gcloud
gcloud privateca templates create server - tls \
-- predefined - values - file leaf_server_tls_values . yaml \
-- copy - sans -- no - copy - subject \
-- identity - cel - expression "subject_alt_names.all(san, san.type == DNS)"
For more information about the gcloud privateca templates create command, see gcloud privateca templates create .
DNS server TLS certificates with only test domains
To create a certificate template for issuing server TLS certificates with DNS
SANs limited to test domains, use the following gcloud command:
gcloud
gcloud privateca templates create server - tls \
-- predefined - values - file leaf_server_tls_values . yaml \
-- copy - sans -- no - copy - subject \
-- identity - cel - expression "subject_alt_names.all(san, san.type == DNS && san.value.endsWith('.test.example.com'))"
The contents of the leaf_server_tls_values.yaml file must be the same as the previous example.
For more information about using CEL expressions to ensure DNS names start or end with a particular string, see CEL example expressions .
Workload identity certificates
To create a certificate template for issuing mutual TLS (mTLS) certificates, use
the following instructions:
Create a file with the name leaf_mtls_values.yaml and add the following
end-entity mutual TLS configuration to it.
leaf_mtls_values.yaml
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
digitalSignature : true
keyEncipherment : true
extendedKeyUsage :
serverAuth : true
clientAuth : true
caOptions :
isCa : false
To only allow certificates with SPIFFE URI SANs, use the
following gcloud command:
gcloud
gcloud privateca templates create workload - spiffe \
-- predefined - values - file leaf_mtls_values . yaml \
-- copy - sans -- no - copy - subject \
-- identity - cel - expression "subject_alt_names.all(san, san.type == URI && san.value.startsWith('spiffe://'))"
For more information about the gcloud privateca templates create command, see gcloud privateca templates create .
For more information about using CEL expressions to ensure DNS names start or end with a particular string, see CEL example expressions .
Grant access to the certificate template
You can use a certificate template if you have the CA Service Certificate Template User ( roles/privateca.templateUser ) role. We recommend that the authors of a certificate template grant the CA Service Certificate Template User role to the members in the organization who might use that certificate template.
To grant the CA Service Certificate Template User ( roles/privateca.templateUser ) role to everyone in the example.com domain, use the following gcloud command:
gcloud
gcloud privateca templates add-iam-policy-binding TEMPLATE_ID \
--member "domain:example.com" \
--role "roles/privateca.templateUser"
Replace the following:
TEMPLATE_ID : the unique identifier of the certificate template.
For more information about the gcloud privateca templates add-iam-policy-binding command, see gcloud privateca templates add-iam-policy-binding .
For more information about IAM roles for CA Service,
and their associated permissions, see Access control with IAM .
