Apply workload updates
This page describes how to enable, view, and apply workload updates for
Assured Workloads folders. Assured Workloads regularly updates
its control packages with new
settings and general improvements, such as updated organization policy
constraint values. This feature lets you evaluate your current
Assured Workloads folder configuration against the latest available
configuration, and choose to apply any proposed updates.
By default, this feature is automatically enabled for new
Assured Workloads folders. For existing folders, we strongly recommend
that you follow the steps to enable workload updates .
Important: If you choose not to enable workload updates for existing folders,
you won't be automatically notified when new updates are available for your
workloads, nor be able to update their configuration.
This feature does not incur any additional charges, nor does it affect the
behavior of
Assured Workloads monitoring ;
you will still be alerted when your folder falls out of compliance with its
current configuration, regardless of whether updates to its configuration are
available.
Workload updates overview
When you create a new Assured Workloads folder, the
control package type you
select—such as FedRAMP Moderate—determines the various configuration
settings that are applied on your workload. Some of these settings are
externally visible in the form of organization policy constraints, although
others are only applicable to Google's internal systems.
Assured Workloads uses an internal configuration versioning system to
maintain changes for each control package type.
When a new internal configuration version becomes available,
Assured Workloads compares your workload's configuration to the new
internal version. Any differences are analyzed, and the resulting enhancements
become available as an update that you can apply to your workload's
configuration. When such enhancements include support for a new service, any
organization policy constraints required for that service might also be applied
on your workload.
Available Assured Workloads updates have been verified by Google to
be compliant with the requirements of your workload's control package. However,
it's still your responsibility to review each available update to verify that it
meets your organization's regulatory or compliance requirements. See
Shared responsibility in Assured Workloads
for more information.
Note: If a workload update becomes available, but you choose to manually change
your workload's organization policy before applying that update, you will be
unable to apply it. To apply the update, you either must restore the previous
organization policy settings (prior to your manual changes), or wait until the
next workload update becomes available. In this scenario, we recommend that you
restore your previous organization policy settings and apply the workload
update, since a new update might not be available for some time.
Supported update types
This feature supports viewing and applying the following types of updates on an
Assured Workloads folder:
Organization policy constraints : Any organization policy constraints that
are applicable to your workload and enforced by Assured Workloads
can be included in a workload update, with the following exceptions:
gcp.resourceLocations
gcp.restrictCmekCryptoKeyProjects
Note: gcp.restrictServiceUsage updates are available in the Google Cloud console
but are not available when using the Assured Workloads API. For
example, you won't receive gcp.restrictServiceUsage updates when calling the
updates method as described in the View workload updates section.
Control package launch stages : This feature only supports viewing and
applying updates when a given
control package is in the same
launch stage as
when you first deployed it. For example, if you deploy a workload for a
control package when it's in the Preview launch stage and that control package
later becomes generally available, you must first redeploy your workload using
the GA version before you can apply updates. If you don't redeploy your
workload, you may encounter errors or compliance violations after attempting
to apply updates.
Before you begin
Identify the resource IDs for the Assured Workloads folders for
which to enable updates.
Assign or verify IAM permissions on the target
Assured Workloads folders and workloads.
Required IAM permissions
To enable, view, or apply workload updates, the caller must be granted
IAM permissions using either a
predefined role that includes a
wider set of permissions, or a
custom role that is restricted to the minimum
necessary permissions. Note that the required orgpolicy.policy.set permission
is unavailable for use in custom roles.
The following permissions are required:
assuredworkloads.workload.update on the target workload to enable updates.
This permission is included in the
Assured Workloads Editor ( roles/assuredworkloads.editor )
and
Assured Workloads Admin ( roles/assuredworkloads.admin )
predefined roles.
assuredworkloads.updates.list on the target workload to view available
updates. This permission is included in the
Assured Workloads Reader ( roles/assuredworkloads.reader ) ,
Assured Workloads Editor ( roles/assuredworkloads.editor ) ,
and
Assured Workloads Admin ( roles/assuredworkloads.admin )
predefined roles.
assuredworkloads.updates.update on the target workload to apply available
updates. This permission is included in the
Assured Workloads Editor ( roles/assuredworkloads.editor ) ,
and
Assured Workloads Admin ( roles/assuredworkloads.admin )
predefined roles.
assuredworkloads.operations.get on the target workload to get the status and
results of an update operation. This permission is included in the
Assured Workloads Reader ( roles/assuredworkloads.reader ) ,
Assured Workloads Editor ( roles/assuredworkloads.editor ) ,
and
Assured Workloads Admin ( roles/assuredworkloads.admin )
predefined roles.
orgpolicy.policy.get on the target folder to apply available updates. This
permission is included in the
Organization Policy Viewer ( roles/orgpolicy.policyViewer )
and
Organization Policy Administrator ( roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin )
predefined roles.
orgpolicy.policy.set on the target folder to apply available updates. This
permission is not supported in custom roles, but it's included in the
Organization Policy Administrator ( roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin )
predefined role.
resourcemanager.folders.getIamPolicy and
resourcemanager.folders.setIamPolicy on the target folder to enable updates.
These permissions are included in the
Folder IAM Admin ( roles/resourcemanager.folderIamAdmin )
role and other highly permissive predefined roles.
Enable workload updates
When you enable workload updates, the
Assured Workloads Service Agent
is created. This service agent is then granted the
Assured Workloads Service Agent ( roles/assuredworkloads.serviceAgent )
role on the target Assured Workloads folder. This role enables the
service agent to check for any available updates on the folder.
To enable workload updates, complete the following steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Assured Workloads
page.
Go to Assured Workloads
At the top of the page in the Introducing Compliance Updates pane,
click Enable compliance updates .
When prompted to Enable compliance updates? , click Enable .
Workload updates are now enabled for all Assured Workloads folders
in your organization.
REST
The
enableComplianceUpdates
method enables Assured Workloads to notify you of updates for a
single Assured Workloads folder.
HTTP method, URL, and query parameters:
PUT https:// [ ENDPOINT_URI ] /v1/organizations/ [ ORGANIZATION_ID ] /locations/ [ LOCATION_ID ] /workloads/ [ WORKLOAD_ID ] :enableComplianceUpdates
Replace the following placeholder values with your own:
ENDPOINT_URI : The Assured Workloads
service endpoint URI .
This URI must be the endpoint matching the location of the destination
workload, such as https://us-west1-assuredworkloads.googleapis.com for a
regionalized workload in the us-west1 region and
https://us-assuredworkloads.googleapis.com for a multi-region workload in
the US.
ORGANIZATION_ID : The organization ID for the
Assured Workloads folder—for example, 919698201234 .
LOCATION_ID : The location of the Assured Workloads
folder—for example, us-west1 or us . It corresponds to the
data region value of the workload.
WORKLOAD_ID : The ID of the Assured Workloads workload

Apply workload updates
Applying a workload update to a workload is a long-running operation. If your
workload configuration changes after starting the operation and before it's
complete, an error might occur.
Additionally, workload updates are periodically re-evaluated against the latest
available configuration. In this case, additional updates might be available
immediately after you've applied an update.
To apply workload updates, complete the following steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Assured Workloads
page.
Go to Assured Workloads
In the Name column, click the name of the Assured Workloads
folder for which you want to view updates. Alternatively, if updates are
available for the folder, click the link in the Updates column.
Under Available updates , click Review available updates .
If available, organization policy updates are shown in the
Organization policy tab. Review the affected organization policy
constraint and click View update to preview the updated constraint
settings.
Note: If gcp.restrictServiceUsage updates are available, any required
service-specific organization policy constraints for a service won't
appear in the list of available updates. However, if you choose to apply a
gcp.restrictServiceUsage update, these required constraints (such as
compute.disableGlobalCloudArmorPolicy for EU Data Boundary) will be
applied to your workload.
Click Update organization policy to apply the update.
The long-running update operation starts, and the folder's new organization
policy settings will be applied.
REST
The
organizations.locations.workloads.updates.apply
method applies the specified update for an Assured Workloads
workload.
HTTP method, URL, and query parameters:
POST https:// [ ENDPOINT_URI ] /v1/organizations/ [ ORGANIZATION_ID ] /locations/ [ LOCATION_ID ] /workloads/ [ WORKLOAD_ID ] /updates/ [ UPDATE_ID ] :apply
Replace the following placeholder values with your own:
ENDPOINT_URI : The Assured Workloads
service endpoint URI .
This URI must be the endpoint matching the location of the destination
workload, such as https://us-central1-assuredworkloads.googleapis.com for
a regionalized workload in the us-central1 region and
https://us-assuredworkloads.googleapis.com for a multi-region workload in
the US.
ORGANIZATION_ID : The organization ID for the
Assured Workloads folder—for example, 919698201234 .
LOCATION_ID : The location of the Assured Workloads
folder—for example, us-central1 or us . It corresponds to the
data region value of the workload.
WORKLOAD_ID : The ID of the Assured Workloads workload
for which to list available updates—for example,
00-701ea036-7152-4780-a867-9f5 .
UPDATE_ID : The ID of the update to apply, selected from the list
of available updates returned by the
organizations.locations.workloads.updates.list
method—for example, edb84871-833b-45ec-9c00-c9b5c19d2d87 .
Request body:
{
"name" : "organizations/ [ORGANIZATION_ID] /locations/ [LOCATION_ID] /workloads/ [WORKLOAD_ID] /updates/ [UPDATE_ID] " ,
"action" : "APPLY"
}
For example:
POST https://us-central1-assuredworkloads.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/919698298765/locations/us-central1/workloads/00-701ea036-7152-4781-a867-9f5/updates/edb84871-833b-45ec-9c00-c9b5c19d2d87:apply
{
"name" : "organizations/919698298765/locations/us-central1/workloads/00-701ea036-7152-4781-a867-9f5/updates/edb84871-833b-45ec-9c00-c9b5c19d2d87" ,
"action" : "APPLY"
}
If successful, you will receive a JSON response similar to the following
example:
{
"name" : "organizations/919698298765/locations/us-central1/operations/647b1c77-b9a5-45d2-965e-70a1e867fe5b" ,

"create_time" : "2024-10-01T14:34:30.290896Z" ,
"action" : "APPLY"
}
}
To get the status of a long-running update operation, use the operation ID
in the name value from the JSON response. Using the previous example, the
operation ID is 647b1c77-b9a5-45d2-965e-70a1e867fe5b . Then make the
following request, replacing the placeholder values with your own:
GET https:// [ ENDPOINT_URI ] /v1/organizations/ [ ORGANIZATION_ID ] /locations/ [ LOCATION_ID ] /operations/ [ OPERATION_ID ]
For example:
GET https://us-central1-assuredworkloads.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/919698298765/locations/us-central1/operations/647b1c77-b9a5-45d2-965e-70a1e867fe5b
