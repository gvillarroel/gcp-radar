Migrate a workload
This page describes how to perform a compliance analysis before migrating an
existing project to an Assured Workloads folder. This analysis compares
the source project and the destination Assured Workloads folder to
determine what changes might be required before or after you initiate the
migration. For example, if you have a project that you want to move to an
Assured Workloads folder configured for FedRAMP Moderate, you can
proactively address any potential compliance violations that might occur before
moving the project.
The following types of findings are returned by the move analysis:
The source project uses unsupported products or services.
The source project contains resources that are located in a disallowed
location.
The source project is configured with organization policy constraint values
that are incompatible with the destination Assured Workloads folder.
These findings are important to discover before attempting a move. By default,
an Assured Workloads folder can only contain resource types for the
services that are supported by
the folder's control package. If your project contains resources for a
service that is not supported by the folder's control package, you may need
to redeploy or remove those resources.
Although you can change the default list of supported services for an
Assured Workloads folder by changing its
resource usage restriction organization policy
—thus allowing non-compliant services to be deployed in your folder—
the non-compliant service and its resources will be ignored by background
compliance checks. Therefore, by enabling an unsupported service, you are
choosing to accept the risk that it may cause your workload to fall out of
compliance.
Note: After performing a migration analysis and addressing any findings, the
steps for moving a project to an Assured Workloads folder are the same
as when moving any project in Google Cloud. See
Moving a project in the
Resource Manager documentation.
Migrating Assured Workloads folders and projects
If you're migrating Assured Workloads folders or projects, only migrate
them to a folder that uses the same control package. Otherwise, you can incur
additional billing fees and undermine your compliance status.
Before you begin
Gather the resource IDs for both the source project and the destination
Assured Workloads folder.
Assign or verify IAM permissions on both the
source project and the destination Assured Workloads folder to
ensure that the caller is authorized to perform the migration.
Required IAM permissions
To perform a migration analysis, the caller must be granted IAM
permissions using either a
predefined role that includes a
wider set of permissions, or a
custom role that is restricted to
the minimum necessary permissions.
The following permissions are required:
assuredworkloads.workload.get on the destination
workload
cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources on the source project
orgpolicy.policy.get on the source project and destination
Assured Workloads folder
Performing a migration analysis
When performing an analysis on the source project and the destination
Assured Workloads folder, you should address any findings before moving
the project to the destination. Although the findings don't prevent you from
moving the project, they may result in compliance violations in the destination
Assured Workloads folder.
These findings are of two different types:
Warning : A warning result occurs when the source project is potentially
incompatible with the destination, and may result in a compliance violation.
Warnings should be investigated to verify that the incompatibility is either
acceptable or should be addressed before the move.
Blocker : A blocker result occurs when a compliance violation is detected
between the source project and the destination. Blockers must be addressed
before proceeding with a move.
The following types of findings are reported:
Resource locations : Many control packages enforce location restrictions
for resources to adhere to compliance requirements, such as if your source
project contains resources that are located in a disallowed location.
To resolve this issue, move the affected resources to allowed locations,
delete them, or modify the target's gcp.resourceLocations organization
policy constraint setting.
Unsupported products/services : Each control package supports a
specific list of Google Cloud products and services. If your project uses a
service that is unsupported by the destination Assured Workloads
folder's control package, this will be listed as a finding.
Warning: We recommend that you don't migrate a project that uses unsupported
products or services without first disabling them. However, if you choose to
accept the risk and proceed with the migration, be sure to
disable resource usage restrictions
on the destination folder or update it to allow the unsupported services.
Organization Policy constraints : Your source project may be configured
with organization policy constraint values that differ from the destination
Assured Workloads folder's effective policy, or are not compliant
with the target control package. This analysis is performed only for
constraints that are relevant to the destination Assured Workloads
folder's control package; all of the project's constraint values are not
evaluated. Several outcomes are possible, such as the following issues:
Your project and the destination's effective policy are incompatible.
Your project has organization policy constraint values that aren't set
on the destination, or the other way around.
Your project has organization policy constraint values that aren't
compliant with the target control package.
If a blocker is found for an organization policy constraint, the response
includes the expected values that are compliant with the target control
package. You can use these expected values to make changes to your project
before you perform a migration.
To resolve this issue, determine which organization policy constraint needs to
be modified, and
make the required changes .
Unsupported finding types
The migration analysis doesn't support the following types of findings:
Resource-level incompatibilities for organization policy constraints other
than gcp.resourceLocations . For example, some control packages are
configured with the global gcp.restrictCmekCryptoKeyProjects constraint or
the Compute Engine-specific compute.disableNestedVirtualization
constraint; incompatibilities with these constraints between the source and
destination are not analyzed or reported.
Service-specific features that may be disabled for a given control package.
For example,
Cloud Monitoring's uptime checks
are disabled for IL4 folders and
BigQuery's remote functions
are disabled for ITAR folders; if your source project uses such disabled
features, these incompatibilities are not analyzed or reported.
Analyzing moving a project to an Assured Workloads folder
The
analyzeWorkloadMove
method performs an analysis of moving the source project to the destination
Assured Workloads folder.
In the request example below, replace the following parameters with your own:
ENDPOINT_URI : The Assured Workloads
service endpoint URI .
This URI must be the endpoint matching the location of the destination
workload, such as https://us-west1-assuredworkloads.googleapis.com for a
regionalized workload in the us-west1 region and
https://us-assuredworkloads.googleapis.com for a multi-region workload in
the US.
DESTINATION_ORGANIZATION_ID : The organization ID for the
destination workload to which the source project will be migrated. For
example: 919698201234
DESTINATION_LOCATION_ID : The location of the destination
workload. For example: us-west1 or us . It corresponds to the
data region value of the workload.
DESTINATION_WORKLOAD_ID : The ID of the destination
Assured Workloads folder where the source project will be migrated.
For example:
00-701ea036-7152-4780-a867-9f5
SOURCE_PROJECT_ID : Query parameter for the ID of the source
project to be migrated. For example: my-project-123
ASSET_TYPES : Optional. One
asset type per query
parameter that will filter the findings to only the specified type(s).
For example:
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project
PAGE_SIZE : Optional. Query parameter for the number of results to
return per page, up to a maximum of 50. For example: 5
PAGE_TOKEN : Optional. Query parameter for the token to continue
paginated results. For example: CiAKGjBpNDd2Nmp2Zml2cXRwYjBpOXA
HTTP method, URL, and query parameters:
GET https:// [ ENDPOINT_URI ] /v1/organizations/ [ DESTINATION_ORGANIZATION_ID ] /locations/ [ DESTINATION_LOCATION_ID ] /workloads/ [ DESTINATION_WORKLOAD_ID ] :analyzeWorkloadMove?project = projects/ SOURCE_PROJECT_ID &page_size = PAGE_SIZE &page_token = PAGE_TOKEN
For example:
GET https://us-west1-assuredworkloads.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/919698298765/locations/us-west1/workloads/00-701ea036-7152-4781-a867-9f5:analyzeWorkloadMove?project = projects/my-project-123&page_size = 5&page_token = CiAKGjBpNDd2Nmp2Zml2cXRwYjBpOXA
