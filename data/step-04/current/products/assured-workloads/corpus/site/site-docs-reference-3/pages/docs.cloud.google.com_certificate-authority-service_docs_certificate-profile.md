Certificate profiles
This topic provides certificate profiles that you can use for various certificate issuance scenarios. You can reference these certificate profiles when creating a certificate or a certificate authority (CA) using the Google Cloud CLI or the Google Cloud console.
Use the gcloud references specified in this document along with the --use-preset-profile flag to utilize the certificate profile that fits your needs.
Unconstrained
Unconstrained certificate profiles add no constraints or limits.
Root unconstrained
Accessible as : root_unconstrained
The following certificate profile has neither extended key usage nor path-length constraints.
This CA can issue any type of certificate, including subordinate CAs. These values are appropriate for a self-signed root CA but you can also use them for an unconstrained subordinate CA.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
certSign : true
crlSign : true
caOptions :
isCa : true
Subordinate unconstrained with path length of zero
Accessible as : subordinate_unconstrained_pathlen_0
You can use the following certificate profile to configure a CA that has no Extended Key Usage (EKU) constraints, but has a path-length restriction that doesn't allow the issuing of any subordinate CAs. These values are appropriate for CAs issuing end-entity certificates.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
certSign : true
crlSign : true
caOptions :
isCa : true
maxIssuerPathLength : 0
Mutual TLS
Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) certificates can be used for server TLS, client TLS, or mutual TLS authentication.
Subordinate mTLS
Accessible as : subordinate_mtls_pathlen_0
You can use the following certificate profile to configure a CA that can issue end-entity certificates usable for server TLS, client TLS, or mutual TLS authentication. This certificate profile has a path-length restriction that does not allow further subordinate CAs. These values are appropriate for a subordinate CA but they can also be used for a self-signed CA that directly issues end-entity certificates.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
certSign : true
crlSign : true
extendedKeyUsage :
serverAuth : true
clientAuth : true
caOptions :
isCa : true
maxIssuerPathLength : 0
End-entity mTLS
Accessible as : leaf_mtls
You can use the following certificate profile to configure end-entity certificates that are compatible with client TLS, server TLS, or mTLS. For example, SPIFFE certificates.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
digitalSignature : true
keyEncipherment : true
extendedKeyUsage :
serverAuth : true
clientAuth : true
caOptions :
isCa : false
Note: The keyEncipherment field is required only when the accompanying public key uses the RSA encryption algorithm, and the TLS handshake uses an RSA key exchange.
Client TLS
Client TLS certificates are used to authenticate a client.
Subordinate client TLS
Accessible as : subordinate_client_tls_pathlen_0
You can use the following certificate profile to configure a CA that can issue end-entity certificates usable for client TLS. This certificate profile has a path-length restriction that does not allow further subordinate CAs. These values are appropriate for a subordinate CA but they can also be used for a self-signed CA that directly issues end-entity certificates.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
certSign : true
crlSign : true
extendedKeyUsage :
clientAuth : true
caOptions :
isCa : true
maxIssuerPathLength : 0
End-entity client TLS
Accessible as : leaf_client_tls
You can use the following certificate profile to configure end-entity certificates that are compatible with client TLS. For example, a client authenticating itself to a TLS firewall.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
digitalSignature : true
keyEncipherment : true
extendedKeyUsage :
clientAuth : true
caOptions :
isCa : false
Note: The keyEncipherment field is required only when the accompanying public key uses the RSA encryption algorithm, and the TLS handshake uses an RSA key exchange.
Server TLS
Server TLS certificates are used to authenticate a server.
Subordinate server TLS
Accessible as : subordinate_server_tls_pathlen_0
You can use the following certificate profile to configure a CA that can issue end-entity certificates usable for server TLS. This certificate profile has a path-length restriction that does not allow further subordinate CAs. These values are appropriate for a subordinate CA but they can also be used for a self-signed CA that directly issues end-entity certificates.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
certSign : true
crlSign : true
extendedKeyUsage :
serverAuth : true
caOptions :
isCa : true
maxIssuerPathLength : 0
End-entity server TLS
Accessible as : leaf_server_tls
You can use the following certificate profile to configure end-entity certificates that are compatible with server TLS.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
digitalSignature : true
keyEncipherment : true
extendedKeyUsage :
serverAuth : true
caOptions :
isCa : false
Note: The keyEncipherment field is required only when the accompanying public key uses the RSA encryption algorithm, and the TLS handshake uses an RSA key exchange.
Code signing
Digital signatures are used for code authentication.
Subordinate code signing
Accessible as : subordinate_code_signing_pathlen_0
You can use the following certificate profile to configure a CA that can issue end-entity certificates usable for code signing. This certificate profile has a path-length restriction that does not allow further subordinate CAs. These values are appropriate for a subordinate CA but they can also work for a self-signed CA that directly issues end-entity certificates.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
certSign : true
crlSign : true
extendedKeyUsage :
codeSigning : true
caOptions :
isCa : true
maxIssuerPathLength : 0
End-entity code signing
Accessible as : leaf_code_signing
You can use the following certificate profile to configure end-entity certificates that are compatible with code signing.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
digitalSignature : true
contentCommitment : true
extendedKeyUsage :
codeSigning : true
caOptions :
isCa : false
S/MIME
S/MIME is an email-signing protocol that helps improve email security.
Subordinate S/MIME
Accessible as : subordinate_smime_pathlen_0
You can use the following certificate profile to configure a CA that can issue end-entity certificates usable for S/MIME. This certificate profile has a path-length restriction that does not allow further subordinate CAs. These values are appropriate for a subordinate CA but they can also be used for a self-signed CA that directly issues end-entity certificates.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
certSign : true
crlSign : true
extendedKeyUsage :
emailProtection : true
caOptions :
isCa : true
maxIssuerPathLength : 0
End-entity S/MIME
Accessible as : leaf_smime
You can use the following certificate profile to configure end-entity certificates that are compatible with S/MIME. S/MIME is often used for end-to-end email integrity or encryption.
keyUsage :
baseKeyUsage :
digitalSignature : true
contentCommitment : true
extendedKeyUsage :
emailProtection : true
caOptions :
isCa : false
