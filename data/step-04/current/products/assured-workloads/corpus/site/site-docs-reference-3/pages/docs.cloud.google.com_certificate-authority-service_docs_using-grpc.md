Using gRPC with Certificate Authority Service
If you are using manually created gRPC libraries to make API calls to Certificate Authority Service, you must add x-goog-request-params: '<request-field>:<resource-name>' as a header. The proper use of x-goog-request-params ensures that the request is routed to the appropriate region for your CA Service resources.
Given below are a few examples of methods with their respective request field and sample header.
Method : CreateCertificateAuthority Request field : CreateCertificateAuthority.parent
x-goog-request-params: 'parent: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID '
Method : GetCertificateAuthority Request field : GetCertificateAuthority.name
x-goog-request-params: 'name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /certificateAuthorities/ CA_NAME '
Method : UpdateCertificateAuthority Request field : UpdateCertificateAuthority.certificate_authority.name
x-goog-request-params: 'CertificateAuthority.name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /certificateAuthorities/ CA_NAME '
For the complete list of RPC methods and their respective request fields, see Package google.cloud.security.privateca.v1beta1 .
