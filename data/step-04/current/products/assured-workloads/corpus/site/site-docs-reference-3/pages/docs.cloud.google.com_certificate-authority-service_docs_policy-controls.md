Overview of policy controls
Policy controls enforce standards for the operation of the certificate authority (CA)
and the certificates that the CA issues. Policy controls are the rules and restrictions
that you put in place to define how the CA will issue certificates and which
parameters can be included in a request and which values are accepted. In Certificate Authority Service,
policy controls are one of two types:
Coarse-grained policies such as certificate issuance policies :
Certificate issuance policies apply to the entire CA pool and define high-level
constraints such as permitted key types, allowed certificate lifetimes, and
subject and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) constraints.
Fine-grained policies such as certificate templates :
Certificate templates let you define which certificate types can be issued and
who has the authority to issue them, preventing misuse and maintaining security.
Certificate templates offer more granular control by letting you define different
types of certificates for different purposes. For example, you can create
certificate templates for specific use cases like TLS certificates for web servers
and code signing certificates for developers. You can also create templates for
different departments or teams allowing each team to request certificates with
the specific permissions they need.
In addition to the certificate issuance policies and certificate templates, you
can also enforce specific policy controls such as name constraints
to prevent a CA from issuing certificates for unauthorized domains or entities.
About certificate issuance policies
A certificate issuance policy defines controls over all certificate issuance within
a CA pool. A CA Manager can attach a
certificate issuance policy
to a CA pool to define restrictions on the kind of certificates that the CAs in the CA pool can
issue. Certificate issuance policies help you do the following:
Add constraints on allowed subject and SANs that can be requested. This validates
who or what can be identified in the certificate, such as only allowing
certificates for your company's domain.
Define restrictions on certificate identities, certificate lifetimes, key types,
backdate duration, and certificate request modes.
Append specific X.509 extensions into all issued certificates.
We recommend using a certificate issuance policy when either one or both of the following
scenarios apply to you:
Your CA pool is designed to issue certificates according to a single, well-defined profile.
For example, you have a dedicated CA pool that issues certificates only for
your company's internal web servers. These certificates all need the same basic
parameters.
All issued certificates have O=My organization in their subject.
All DNS names end with .cymbalgroup.com .
They're valid for 1 year.
A certificate issuance policy enforces these rules and ensures that every
certificate issued from this CA pool adheres to this profile.
You want to define a common baseline for X.509 extensions and additional restrictions
that apply to all the certificate issuance profiles. For example, you have
different types of certificates such as employee email signing certificates
(valid for 2 years) and TLS certificates for public-facing websites (valid for 1 year).
You can define a baseline issuance policy that applies to all certificates:
All certificates must include the company name in the subject.
All must use a specific set of X.509 extensions for your organization's
security standards.
Then, you can use certificate templates to define the specific variations for
each certificate type on top of that baseline.
For information about adding a certificate issuance policy, see
Add a certificate issuance policy to a CA pool .
About certificate templates
A certificate template represents a relatively static and well-defined certificate
issuance schema within an organization. By using certificate templates, certificates
issued from various CA pools share the same format and properties, regardless of
the issuing CA. The CertificateTemplate resource includes
the following:
A Common Expression Language (CEL)
expression that is evaluated against the requested subject and SANs in all
certificate requests that use the template. For more information about using
CEL, see Using CEL .
An allowlist specifying whether the subject or subject alternative name can
be copied from the end-user request to the issued certificate.
An optional allowlist specifying which X.509 extensions, if any, can be
copied from the end-user request to the issued certificate.
An optional set of X.509 extension values that are added to all the issued
certificates that use the template.
A certificate template can become a complete vertical
certificate issuance framework. For more details, see the full
CertificateTemplate
message definition.
You can use a certificate template when you have a well-defined certificate issuance scenario.
You can use certificate templates to enable consistency across certificates issued
from different CA pools. You can also use a certificate template to restrict the
kinds of certificates that different individuals can issue.
You can also use a combination of certificate templates and Identity and Access Management (IAM)
conditional role bindings to define constraints that apply to certificate requests
made by specific service accounts. For example, you can create a certificate template
that allows only DNS names ending with .altostrat.com . Then, you can
add a conditional role binding
to grant the service account my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
permission to use only that template when requesting certificates from a specific CA Pool.
This limits the service account to issuing certificates with that specific SAN restriction.
To learn how to create certificate templates, see Create a certificate template .
CA certificate name constraints
CA Service enforces name constraints in CA certificates as defined
in the Name Constraints
section of the RFC 5280 document. Name constraints let you control which names are permitted
or excluded in certificates issued from CAs.
Name constraints are implemented using the
Name Constraints extension in X.509 certificates . This extension lets you specify permitted and excluded namespaces for various name forms,
such as DNS names, IP Addresses, email addresses, and URLs.
For example, you can create a CA with name constraints to enforce the following conditions:
Only myownpersonaldomain.com and its subdomains can be used as DNS names.
examplepetstore.com and its subdomains are prohibited as DNS names.
Name constraints are defined within the CA's own certificate. This means that any
certificates issued by that CA are bound by these constraints. When a CA issues
a certificate, it checks the requested subject name and any Subject Alternative
Names (SANs) against the defined name constraints. If any name violates the
constraints, the certificate issuance is rejected.
You can specify name constraints only at the time of creating the CA.
Benefits of using policy controls
Policy controls help you achieve the following:
Enhance security by limiting what types of certificates can be issued and
by reducing the risk of unauthorized certificates being created and misused.
Meet regulatory requirements and industry best practices for certificate management.
Reduce manual effort and potential errors. Certificate templates make it easier
to issue certificates consistently and efficiently.
Establish trust as clearly defined policies and strong controls increase confidence
in the certificates you issue.
Enforcing policy controls
When someone requests a certificate, CA Service evaluates these policy
controls at the following levels:
Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions: First, the service checks if the requester
has the necessary IAM permissions to create certificates or use
the specified certificate template. This ensures that only authorized users can
obtain certificates.
Certificate issuance policy: The service then validates the certificate request
against the CA pool's issuance policy. This ensures that the request meets the
general requirements for certificates issued from that CA.
Certificate template: If a template is used, the request is further validated
against the template's specific constraints. This ensures that the certificate
is appropriate for its intended use.
X.509 extensions from the CA pool's certificate issuance policy and the
certificate template are added to the certificate, and certain values are
dropped based on those same policies. Before signing the certificate, name constraints
in CA certificates are validated against the certificate to ensure the subject is
compliant.
Policy conflicts
When using different policy control mechanisms in conjunction, there is a possibility
that policies on different levels can conflict. For example, a certificate template might
allow a key type (like ECDSA ) that the CA pool's issuance policy forbids. Or the
certificate template and the issuance policy might specify different values for
the same X.509 extension.
