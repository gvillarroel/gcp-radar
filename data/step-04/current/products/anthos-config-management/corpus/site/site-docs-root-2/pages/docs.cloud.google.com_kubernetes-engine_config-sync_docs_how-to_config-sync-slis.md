Use Config Sync SLIs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to use the Config Sync service level indicators
(SLIs).
To receive notifications when Config Sync isn't working as intended, set up
Prometheus alerting rules
based on these SLIs. Each SLI includes an example of how to create an alerting
rule. To learn more about using Prometheus with Config Sync, see Monitor
Config Sync with metrics .
Config Sync Pods with incorrect container count
If the container count of a Config Sync Pod is lower than expected, then
Config Sync might not be running. You can set up an alert to detect this
issue and inspect the Config Sync Pod to figure out why some containers are
missing. When setting your alerts, we recommend that you set the time interval
to at least five minutes to avoid unnecessary alerts. For example, during
upgrading, the container count of a Pod might drop below the target.
If you're not familiar with the expected container count, see
Config Sync Deployments, Pods, and containers .
Prometheus alerting rule examples
This section includes examples that notify you when there are Pods with an
incorrect container count.
To receive a notification when the container count of a root reconciler Pod
is below the expected count, create the following alerting rule:
alert : RootReconcilerPodMissingContainer
expr : count by (cluster_name, pod_name) (kubernetes_io:container_uptime{namespace_name="config-management-system", pod_name=~"root-reconciler-.*"}) < 4
# Setting the for field to 5m to avoid unnecessary alerts.
for : 5m
To receive a notification when the container count of a namespace reconciler
Pod is below the expected count, create the following alerting rule:
alert : NamespaceReconcilerPodMissingContainer
expr : count by (cluster_name, pod_name) (kubernetes_io:container_uptime{namespace_name="config-management-system", pod_name=~"ns-reconciler-.*"}) < 4
for : 5m
To receive a notification when the container count of a reconciler-manager Pod
is below the expected count, create the following alerting rule:
alert : ReconcilerManagerPodMissingContainer
expr : count by (cluster_name, pod_name) (kubernetes_io:container_uptime{namespace_name="config-management-system", pod_name=~"reconciler-manager-.*"}) < 2
for : 5m
Unhealthy Config Sync containers
If the restart count of a Config Sync container reaches a certain
threshold, something is wrong. For example, a root reconciler container which
doesn't have enough memory resources would restart with the OOMKilled error
until it gets enough memory.
Prometheus alerting rule example
To receive a notification when a Config Sync container has restarted more
than three times, create the following alerting rule:
alert : TooManyContainerRestarts
expr : kubernetes_io:container_restart_count{namespace_name=~"config-management-system|config-management-monitoring|resource-group-system"} > 3
Config Sync encountering persistent errors
If Config Sync encounters persistent errors, something is wrong. When
Config Sync encounters errors ,
it keeps retrying to sync configs from the source to a cluster until it's
successful. However, some errors cannot be fixed by retrying and require your
intervention.
Prometheus alerting rule example
To receive a notification when a root or namespace reconciler encounters
persistent errors for two hours, create the following alerting rule:
alert : PersistentConfigSyncErrors
expr : sum by (cluster, configsync_sync_kind, configsync_sync_name, configsync_sync_namespace, errorclass) (config_sync_reconciler_errors) > 0
for : 2h
In this example:
The configsync_sync_kind label can have the following values: RootSync or
RepoSync .
The configsync_sync_name label indicates the name of a RootSync or RepoSync
object.
The configsync_sync_namespace label indicates the namespace of a RootSync
or RepoSync object.
The errorclass label can have three values: 1xxx , 2xxx , and 9xxx . Each
label corresponds to a different type of error:
1xxx errors: configuration errors that you can fix
2xxx errors: server side errors that you might not be able to fix
9xxx errors: internal errors that you can't fix
Config Sync stuck in the syncing stage
A sync attempt in Config Sync is non-interruptible. If the configs in the
source are too big or complex (for example, your source contains a high number of
Config Connector resources), it can take over an hour to finish syncing these configs
to the cluster. However, if two hours have passed since the last successful sync,
something might be wrong.
You can check whether the current sync attempt is still ongoing by checking the
RootSync or RepoSync status. If the current sync attempt is still ongoing, you
can choose to break up your source of truth
so that every source of truth can be synced faster, or increase the
alerting threshold from two hours to something longer. If there's no sync
attempt ongoing, the Config Sync reconciler is broken since it's supposed
to keep retrying until it syncs the configs from source to the cluster
successfully. If this happens, escalate to
Google Cloud Support .
Prometheus alerting rule example
To be notified when the last successful sync of a root or namespace reconciler
was more than two hours ago, create an alerting rule:
alert : OldLastSyncTimestamp
# The status label indicates whether the last sync succeeded or not.
# Possible values: success, error.
expr : time() - topk by (cluster, configsync_sync_kind, configsync_sync_name, configsync_sync_namespace) (1, config_sync_last_sync_timestamp{status="success"}) > 7200
Config Sync experiencing performance regressions
Config Sync might have performance regressions after being upgraded. The
performance regressions can happen in the following ways:
An increase of the time overhead of reconciling a RootSync or RepoSync
object
An increase of the time overhead of reconciling a ResourceGroup object
An increase of the time overhead of syncing configs from source to a cluster
The time overhead of reconciling a RootSync or RepoSync object
The reconciler-manager Deployment reconciles RootSync and RepoSync objects.
You can use the ninetieth percentile of the time overhead of reconciling a
RootSync or RepoSync object to detect performance regressions.
Prometheus alerting rule examples
This section includes Prometheus alerting rules examples that notify you when
the reconciler-manager Deployment has performance regressions.
The following examples send you a notification when the ninetieth percentile of
the time overhead of reconciling a RootSync or RepoSync object over the last 5
hours is over 0.1 seconds for 10 minutes. You can create alerting rules that
monitor all clusters, or a single cluster.
Create the following rule to monitor all clusters:
alert : HighLatencyReconcileRootSyncAndRepoSyncOverall
expr : histogram_quantile(0.9, sum by (le) (rate(config_sync_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket[5h]))) > 0.1
for : 10m
Create the following rule to monitor a single cluster:
alert : HighLatencyReconcileRootSyncAndRepoSyncClusterLevel
expr : histogram_quantile(0.9, sum by (cluster, le) (rate(config_sync_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket[5h]))) > 0.1
for : 10m
The time overhead of reconciling a ResourceGroup object
The resource-group-controller-manager Deployment reconciles ResourceGroup
objects. You can use the ninetieth percentile of the time overhead of
reconciling a ResourceGroup to catch performance regressions.
Prometheus alerting rule examples
This section includes Prometheus alerting rules that notify you when the
resource-group-controller-manager Deployment has performance regressions.
The following examples send you a notification when the ninetieth percentile of
the time overhead of reconciling a ResourceGroup object over the last 5 hours
is over 5 seconds for 10 minutes. You can create alerting rules that
monitor all clusters, or a single cluster.
Create the following rule to monitor all clusters:
alert : HighLatencyReconcileResourceGroupOverall
expr : histogram_quantile(0.9, sum by (le) (rate(config_sync_rg_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket[5h]))) > 5
for : 10m
Create the following rule to monitor a single cluster:
alert : HighLatencyReconcileResourceGroupClusterLevel
expr : histogram_quantile(0.9, sum by (cluster, le) (rate(config_sync_rg_reconcile_duration_seconds_bucket[5h]))) > 5
for : 10m
The time overhead of syncing configs from source to a cluster
A root or namespace reconciler syncs configs from source of truth to a cluster.
You can use the ninetieth percentile of the time overhead of syncing configs
from the source to a cluster to detect performance regressions.
Prometheus alerting rule examples
This section includes Prometheus alerting rules that notify you when the root
or namespace reconciler Deployment has performance regressions.
The following examples send you a notification when the ninetieth percentile of
the time overhead of syncing configs across all clusters over the last five
hours is over one hour for five minutes.You can create alerting rules that
monitor all clusters, or a single cluster.
Create the following rule to monitor all clusters:
alert : HighApplyDurationOverall
expr : histogram_quantile(0.9, sum by (le) (rate(config_sync_apply_duration_seconds_bucket[5h]))) > 3600
for : 5m
Note: The bounds for the histogram distribution are []float64{1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 3600, 5400} .
Create the following rule to monitor a single cluster:
alert : HighApplyDurationRootSyncRepoSyncLevel
expr : histogram_quantile(0.9, sum by (cluster, configsync_sync_kind,configsync_sync_name, configsync_sync_namespace, le) (rate(config_sync_apply_duration_seconds_bucket[5h]))) > 3600
for : 5m
