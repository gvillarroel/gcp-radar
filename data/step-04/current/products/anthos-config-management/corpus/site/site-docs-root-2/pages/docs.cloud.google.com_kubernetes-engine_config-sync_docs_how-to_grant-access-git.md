Grant Config Sync access to your Git repository
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to authenticate Config Sync to your Git repository.
Config Sync requires read-only access to your source of truth
so it can read your configurations, apply them to your clusters, and keep them
in sync.
Choose an authentication method
The authentication method that you use depends on what is supported for your
source type.
The following table summarizes the authentication methods you can use with Config Sync:
Method
Supported sources
Description
Limitations
No authentication
Git, OCI, Helm
No additional setup required.
Only works if your source of truth is public.
SSH key pair
Git
Supported by most Git providers.
Requires key management. Not supported for OCI or Helm.
token
Git, Helm
Supported by most Git providers. Good alternative if your organization doesn't permit the use of SSH keys. Supports username and password for Helm.
Requires token management. Tokens can expire. Not supported for OCI.
Kubernetes service account
OCI, Helm
Uses IAM to grant Artifact Registry access directly to a Kubernetes service account. Requires Workload Identity Federation for GKE to be enabled on your cluster.
Not supported for Git.
Google service account
Git
Uses IAM, which avoids storing credentials in Kubernetes Secrets. Recommended for Secure Source Manager and Cloud Source Repositories. Requires Workload Identity Federation for GKE to be enabled on your cluster.
Requires configuration before and after installing Config Sync on your clusters. Not supported for repositories hosted outside of Secure Source Manager or Cloud Source Repositories.
GitHub App
Git
Direct integration with GitHub. Allows fine-grained permissions.
Only supported for repositories hosted in GitHub.
Config Sync also supports the following authentication methods; however, these methods are only
recommended if you can't use one of the options listed in the preceding table:
cookiefile: might not be supported for all Git providers. Not supported for OCI or Helm.
Compute Engine default service account ( gcenode ): not recommended because this method only works if Workload Identity Federation for GKE is disabled. Supported for Git, OCI, and Helm.
Google service account for Helm and OCI: supported, but not recommended because the Kubernetes service account method requires less configuration.
Authentication with fleet packages
If you use fleet packages , you don't need to complete the instructions
on this page. Fleet packages uses Cloud Build to authenticate to Git, which
lets you authenticate once per project so you don't need to grant access
every time that you install Config Sync on a cluster.
Before you begin
Before you grant Config Sync read-only access to your Git repository, complete the following
tasks:
Prepare, or have access to, a Git repository where you store your configuration
files that you want Config Sync to sync. For more information, see the
following resources:
Add configs to a source of truth : conceptual information about configurations.
GitOps best practices : tips and general best practices for organizing and managing your repository.
Use an unstructured repo : recommendations for using and organizing an unstructured repository.
Create, or have access to, a GKE cluster. Before creating
a cluster, review cluster configuration requirements and recommendations for Config Sync .
Important: Protect any Secrets or sensitive information created as part of the steps on this page.
For example, you can delete the file if you don't need it, or store it in a secure way.
Use an SSH key pair
An SSH key pair consists of two files, a public key and a private key.
Config Sync does not support creating passphrases. Depending on your security
and compliance requirements, you can use a single key pair for all clusters, or
a key pair per cluster.
To grant Config Sync read-only access to your Git repository by using an SSH key pair,
complete the following steps:
Create, or ask your security administrator to provide, an SSH key pair.
If you need to create an SSH key pair, create a 4096-bit RSA key by running the
following command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 \
-C " GIT_REPOSITORY_USERNAME " \
-N '' \
-f /path/to/KEYPAIR_FILENAME
Replace the following:
GIT_REPOSITORY_USERNAME : the username that you want
Config Sync to use to authenticate to the repository. If you use
a third-party Git repository host like GitHub, or you want to use a
service account with Secure Source Manager, we recommend that you
use a separate account for authentication.
/path/to/KEYPAIR_FILENAME : the path to the key pair
file.
Configure your repository to recognize the newly created public key.
Refer to the documentation for your Git hosting provider. You can find instructions for
some common Git hosting providers in the following list:
Secure Source Manager
Bitbucket
GitHub
GitLab
Create the git-creds Secret with the private key:
kubectl create ns config-management-system && \
kubectl create secret generic git-creds \
--namespace = config-management-system \
--from-file = ssh = /path/to/KEYPAIR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME
Note: If you need to use a proxy, pass the
--from-literal=https_proxy= HTTPS_PROXY_URL flag.
Replace /path/to/KEYPAIR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME with
the name of the private key.
Optional, but recommended: To configure known hosts checking when using SSH
authentication, add the known hosts key to the data.known_hosts field in
the git_creds Secret.
To add the known hosts key, run the following command:
kubectl edit secret git-creds --namespace = config-management-system
To add the known_hosts entry under data , run the following command:
known_hosts: KNOWN_HOSTS_KEY
Replace KNOWN_HOSTS_KEY with the known hosts key.
To disable known_hosts checking, remove the known_hosts field from the
Secret.
When you install Config Sync,
use SSH key pair ( ssh ) as the authentication type.
When you enter the URL of your Git repository, the URL must use SSH protocol format.
The format of the URL differs depending on the Git provider.
Use a cookiefile
The process for acquiring a cookiefile depends on the configuration of your
repository. Generally, credentials are stored in a .gitcookies file in a home
directory, or a security administrator provides them.
To grant Config Sync read-only access to your Git repository by using a cookiefile , complete the following steps:
After you create or obtain the cookiefile , add it to a new Secret in
the cluster. We recommend that you use HTTPS for security reasons:
kubectl create ns config-management-system && \
kubectl create secret generic git-creds \
--namespace = config-management-system \
--from-file = cookie_file = /path/to/COOKIEFILE
Replace /path/to/COOKIEFILE with your
path and filename.
Note: If you need to use a proxy, pass the
--from-literal=https_proxy= HTTPS_PROXY_URL flag.
When you install Config Sync,
use cookiefile ( cookiefile ) as the authentication type.
Use a token
If your organization does not permit the use of SSH keys, you might prefer to
use a token.
To grant Config Sync read-only access to your Git repository by using a token, complete the following steps:
Generate a token from your Git provider. Refer to the documentation for your
Git hosting provider for instructions. You can find instructions for
some common Git hosting providers in the following list:
GitHub: Create a PAT .
Grant the token the repo scope so that it can read from private repositories.
Because you bind a PAT to a GitHub account, we also recommend that you create a
machine user
and bind your PAT to the machine user.
GitLab : Create a PAT
or create a deploy token .
Bitbucket: Create an app password .
After you create or obtain a token, add it to a new Secret in
the cluster. We recommend that you use HTTPS for security reasons:
kubectl create ns config-management-system && \
kubectl create secret generic git-creds \
--namespace = config-management-system \
--from-literal = username = USERNAME \
--from-literal = token = TOKEN
Note: If you need to use a proxy, pass the
--from-literal=https_proxy= HTTPS_PROXY_URL flag.
Replace the following:
USERNAME : the username that you want to use.
TOKEN : the token that you created in the previous step.
When you install Config Sync,
use token ( token ) as the authentication type.
Use a Google service account
You can grant Config Sync access to a repository in the same project as
your managed cluster by using a Google service account. You must meet the
following requirements:
Your repository is in Secure Source Manager or Cloud Source Repositories .
Your cluster has Workload Identity Federation for GKE
or fleet Workload Identity Federation for GKE enabled.
To grant Config Sync read-only access to your Git repository by using a Google service account, complete the following steps:
To get the permissions that
you need to create a policy binding,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Service Account Admin ( roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin )
IAM role on the service account.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
If you don't already have a service account,
create a service account .
Grant the IAM role to the Google service account, depending on the
repository type that you're using:
Secure Source Manager
Grant the Secure Source Manager Instance Accessor ( roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor ) and
Secure Source Manager Repo Reader ( roles/securesourcemanager.repoReader ) IAM roles to the Google service account:
Grant project-wide permission if the same permissions apply to all
repositories in the project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role = roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor \
--member = "serviceAccount: GSA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role = roles/securesourcemanager.repoReader \
--member = "serviceAccount: GSA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID.
GSA_NAME : the name of the Google service account
that you want to connect to Secure Source Manager.
To grant repository-specific permission, see the Secure Source Manager
documentation for
Granting users repository-level roles .
When you install Config Sync, use Workload Identity
( gcpserviceaccount ) as the authentication type. You must also add your service account email.
Secure Source Manager requires a specific format for the repository URL:
https:// SSM_INSTANCE_ID - PROJECT_NUMBER -git. INSTANCE_LOCATION .sourcemanager.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPO_NAME .git .
Cloud Source Repositories
Grant the Cloud Source Repositories Reader ( roles/source.reader )
IAM role to the Google service account:
Grant project-wide permission if the same permissions apply to all
repositories in the project:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role = roles/source.reader \
--member = "serviceAccount: GSA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID.
GSA_NAME : the name of the Google service account
that you want to connect to Cloud Source Repositories.
Grant repository-specific permission when you want service accounts to
have different levels of access for each repository in your project:
gcloud source repos set-iam-policy REPOSITORY POLICY_FILE --project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID.
REPOSITORY : the name of the repository.
POLICY_FILE : the JSON or YAML file that
contains the Identity and Access Management policy.
When you install Config Sync,
use Workload Identity ( gcpserviceaccount ) as the authentication type.
You must also add your service account email.
The following step must be completed after configuring Config Sync
because the Kubernetes service account is not created until you configure
Config Sync for the first time. You only need to do this once per fleet.
To create the binding that lets the Kubernetes service account
act as the Google service account, run the following command:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
GSA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
--member = "serviceAccount: FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog[config-management-system/ KSA_NAME ]" \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : if you use
Workload Identity Federation for GKE, the value is the same as
PROJECT_ID . If you use fleet Workload Identity Federation for GKE, use
the project ID of the fleet that your cluster is registered to as the value.
GSA_NAME : the custom Google service account that
you want to use to connect to Secure Source Manager or Cloud Source Repositories.
KSA_NAME : the Kubernetes service account for the
reconciler. In most cases, the value is root-sync because Config Sync
automatically creates a RootSync object named
root-sync when installed with the Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI.
Otherwise, use root-reconciler- ROOT_SYNC_NAME as the value.
If you have issues connecting to Config Sync with a Google service account,
refer to Troubleshooting permission issues with a Google service account .
Use a Compute Engine default service account
As an alternative to a Google service account, if you don't have Workload Identity Federation for GKE
enabled, you can use a Compute Engine
service account to authenticate. This method is supported only for repositories in
Secure Source Manager and Cloud Source Repositories.
To grant Config Sync read-only access to your repository by using a
Compute Engine default service account, grant the default service account the
roles/source.reader role:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role = roles/source.reader \
--member = "serviceAccount: PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
PROJECT_NUMBER : with your project number.
When you install Config Sync,
use Google Cloud Repository ( gcenode ) as the authentication type.
Use a GitHub App
If your repository is in GitHub, you can use the GitHub App to connect your
repository to Config Sync:
Follow the instructions on GitHub
to provision a GitHub App and give it permission to read from your repository.
Add the GitHub App configuration to a new Secret in the cluster by using either
the client or application ID:
client ID
kubectl create ns config-management-system && \
kubectl create secret generic git-creds \
--namespace = config-management-system \
--from-literal = github-app-client-id = CLIENT_ID \
--from-literal = github-app-installation-id = INSTALLATION_ID \
--from-file = github-app-private-key = /path/to/GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY \
--from-literal = github-app-base-url = BASE_URL
Replace CLIENT_ID with the client ID for the GitHub App.
Replace INSTALLATION_ID with the installation ID for the GitHub App.
Replace /path/to/GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY with
the name of the file containing the private key.
Replace BASE_URL with the base URL for the
GitHub API endpoint. This value is only needed when the repository is not
hosted at www.github.com. The argument can otherwise be omitted and
defaults to https://api.github.com/ .
application ID
kubectl create ns config-management-system && \
kubectl create secret generic git-creds \
--namespace = config-management-system \
--from-literal = github-app-application-id = APPLICATION_ID \
--from-literal = github-app-installation-id = INSTALLATION_ID \
--from-file = github-app-private-key = /path/to/GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY \
--from-literal = github-app-base-url = BASE_URL
Replace APPLICATION_ID with the application ID for the GitHub App.
Replace INSTALLATION_ID with the installation ID for the GitHub App.
Replace /path/to/GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY with
the name of the file containing the private key.
Replace BASE_URL with the base URL for the
GitHub API endpoint. This value is only required if the repository
is not hosted at www.github.com. The argument can otherwise be
omitted and defaults to https://api.github.com/ .
When you install Config Sync,
use GitHub app ( githubapp ) as the authentication type.
