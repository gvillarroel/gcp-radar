Use the nomos command-line tool
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The nomos command-line tool is an optional tool for Config Sync that
you can use to get the status of Config Sync and the sync status
of your source of truth . The
nomos tool provides you with the following commands:
Command
Usage
nomos status
Check Config Sync status
nomos vet
Check for errors in the source of truth
nomos hydrate
View all configs in the source of truth
nomos bugreport
Create a bug report
nomos migrate
Migrate from ConfigManagement object to RootSync
nomos init
Initialize a hierarchical source of truth
Prerequisites
Before you can use the nomos tool to interact with a cluster, Config Sync
must already be installed on the target cluster. You must also
install and configure the kubectl command-line tool .
If you're interacting with Google Kubernetes Engine clusters, ensure that you also
install the
gke-gcloud-auth-plugin .
The nomos tool supports previewing and validating Kustomize configurations and
Helm charts. Before you can use this feature, install
Kustomize
and Helm in your local
workstation. If your source of truth only contains fully
rendered configurations, Kustomize and Helm are optional.
Install the nomos tool
The nomos tool is a binary compiled from Go code and you can install it
locally, for example, on a workstation or laptop.
The nomos tool is not included when you install Config Sync. You can
install the nomos tool by installing the Google Cloud CLI . If
you use Cloud Shell , the
Google Cloud CLI comes pre-installed.
If you do not have the Google Cloud CLI, we recommend that you use
gcloud components install nomos to
install the nomos tool. Installing the nomos tool with the Google Cloud CLI
lets you use
gcloud components update to
update the nomos tool to the latest version.
For information on alternate ways to install the nomos tool, see
Downloads .
Basic usage
For basic command syntax, use the --help argument:
nomos --help
The nomos tool reads from the local clone of your source of truth. Use the --path
flag to specify the location of the top level of the source of truth. By default,
--path is set to . , or the current directory. For example:
nomos vet --path= PATH_TO_SOURCE --source-format unstructured
Check Config Sync status
You can monitor the status of Config Sync on all enrolled clusters by using
the nomos status command. For each cluster, nomos status reports the hash of
the commit that was last applied to the cluster and any errors that
occurred while trying to apply any recent changes.
You can also use nomos status to check if the resources managed by
Config Sync are ready. nomos status reports the status for each individual
resource in the STATUS column of the Managed resources section of the output.
The following example shows you some of the different conditions that the
nomos status command might report:
nomos status

SYNCED 34d1a8c8
Managed resources:
NAMESPACE NAME STATUS
gamestore configmap/store-inventory Current
gamestore webstore.marketplace.com/gameplace Current
In this output:
MANAGED_CLUSTER_1 has synced the most recent change to the source of truth and
all managed resources have a status of Current . A status of Current means
that the state of the resource matches the state that you want.
MANAGED_CLUSTER_2 is still syncing.
MANAGED_CLUSTER_3 has an error that has prevented the change from being
applied. In this example, MANAGED_CLUSTER_3 has error
KNV1021 since it's missing a
CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) that the other clusters have installed.
MANAGED_CLUSTER_4 does not have Config Sync installed.
MANAGED_CLUSTER_5 is syncing from two Git repositories.
The <root> source of truth belongs to the cluster admin and the bookstore
source of truth might belong to an application development team.
Managed resource statuses
The status of your managed resources can be one of the following values:
InProgress : The actual state of the resource has not yet reached the
state that you specified in the resource manifest. This status means that the
resource reconciliation is not complete yet. Newly created resources usually
start with this status, although some resources like ConfigMaps are Current
immediately.
Failed : The process of reconciling the actual state with the state that you
want has encountered an error or it has made insufficient progress.
Current : The actual state of the resource matches the state that you want.
The reconciliation process is considered complete until there are changes to
either the wanted or the actual state.
Terminating : The resource is in the process of being deleted.
NotFound : The resource does not exist in the cluster.
Unknown : Config Sync is unable to determine the status of the resource.
To turn off showing the resource level status, add --resources=false to the
nomos status command.
About last synced commit
The nomos status command displays the most recent commit hash that was
applied to the cluster in its output under status.sync.commit . To obtain this
value, query the RootSync or RepoSync object and look at the status.sync
field.
For example, to query a RootSync object, run the following command:
kubectl get rootsyncs.configsync.gke.io -n config-management-system root-sync -o yaml
Example output:
apiVersion : configsync.gke.io/v1beta1
kind : RootSync
status :
sync :
commit : f1739af550912034139aca51e382dc50c4036ae0
lastUpdate : "2021-04-20T00:25:01Z"
To query a RepoSync object, run the following command:
kubectl get reposync.configsync.gke.io -n NAMESPACE repo-sync -o yaml
Replace NAMESPACE with the namespace that you created
your namespace source of truth in.
Example output:
apiVersion : configsync.gke.io/v1beta1
kind : RepoSync
status :
sync :
commit : ed95b50dd918cf65d8908f7561cb8d8d1f179c2f
lastUpdate : "2021-04-20T00:25:20Z"
This commit represents the most recent commit against the cluster. However, not
every resource in the cluster is affected by each commit; to see the most
recent commit for a specific resource, query the specific resource and look at
metadata.annotations.configmanagement.gke.io/token . For example:
kubectl get clusterroles CLUSTER_ROLE_NAME -o yaml
Replace CLUSTER_ROLE_NAME with the name of the cluster
role you want to query.
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ClusterRole
metadata :
annotations :
configmanagement.gke.io/token : ed95b50dd918cf65d8908f7561cb8d8d1f179c2f
nomos status flags
To customize the nomos status command, add the following flags:
Flag
Description
--contexts
Accepts a comma-separated list of contexts to use in multi-cluster
commands. Defaults to all contexts. Use "" for no contexts.
-h or --help
Help for the nomos status command.
--name
Accepts a string. Use this flag to filter Root and Repo Sync with
the provided name. This flag can be used alongside the
namespace flag.
--namespace
Accepts a string. Use the namespace flag to limit the
command to a specific namespace source of truth. Leave unset to
get all sources. This flag is only available if you enabled
syncing from more than one source of truth.
--poll
Use the poll flag to run
nomos status continuously and have it reprint the status
table at a regular interval. For example 3s . Leave this flag
unset to run nomos status once
--resources
Accepts true or false . If true ,
nomos status shows the resource level status for your root
or namespace source of truth when syncing from more than one source of truth.
The default value is true .
--timeout
Timeout for connecting to each cluster. The default value is
3s .
Required permissions
If you are a project owner, you have the cluster-admin RBAC role and you can
use the nomos status command for any clusters in your project without adding
any further permissions. If you don't have the cluster-admin role, you can use
nomos status by creating the following ClusterRole:
Create a file named nomos-status-reader.yaml and copy the following
ClusterRole into it. The rules that you need differ depending on
whether you are using
RootSync and RepoSync objects .
Using RootSync and RepoSync objects
# nomos-status-reader.yaml
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ClusterRole
metadata :
name : nomos-status-reader
rules :
- apiGroups : [ "configsync.gke.io" ]
resources : [ "reposyncs" , "rootsyncs" ]
verbs : [ "get" ]
- nonResourceURLs : [ "/" ]
verbs : [ "get" ]
Not using RootSync and RepoSync objects
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ClusterRole
metadata :
name : nomos-status-reader
rules :
- apiGroups : [ "configmanagement.gke.io" ]
resources : [ "configmanagements" , "repos" ]
verbs : [ "get" , "list" ]
- nonResourceURLs : [ "/" ]
verbs : [ "get" ]
Apply the nomos-status-reader.yaml file:
kubectl apply -f nomos-status-reader.yaml
Check for errors in the source of truth
Before you commit a config to the source of truth, use the nomos vet command to
check the syntax and validity of the configs in your source of truth:
nomos vet --source-format unstructured
If syntax errors are found, the nomos vet command exits with a non-zero status
and logs error messages to STDERR .
nomos vet flags
To customize the nomos vet command, add the following flags:
Flag
Description
--api-server-timeout
Accepts a duration string. Sets the client-side timeout for talking to
the Kubernetes API server. Defaults to 15s .
--clusters
Accepts a comma-separated list of cluster names to use in multi-cluster
commands. Defaults to all clusters. Use "" for no clusters.
--format
Accepts yaml or json . The format of the
output. The default value is yaml .
-h or --help
Help for the nomos vet command.
--keep-output
Accepts a Boolean. If true , the rendered output is saved to
the location that you can specify with the --output flag.
--namespace
Accepts a string. If set, validates the source of truth as a namespace
source of truth with the provided name. Automatically sets
--source-format=unstructured .
--no-api-server-check
Accepts a Boolean. If true , disables talking to the
Kubernetes API server for discovery. For more information on this flag,
see the Server-side validation section.
--output
Accepts a string. The path to the rendered output. Defaults to the
compiled directory. If --keep-output is set to
false , this flag is ignored.
--path
Accepts a string. The path to the root directory of your Config Sync
source of truth. The default is " . "
--source-format
Accepts hierarchy or unstructured . If
hierarchy or unset, validates the source of truth as a
hierarchical source of truth . If
unstructured , validates the source of truth as an
unstructured source of truth .
This flag is required if you are using an unstructured source of truth.
--threshold
Optionally accepts an integer. Sets the maximum objects allowed per
repository; errors if exceeded. Omit the flag or use
--threshold=0 to disable the maximum objects validation.
Provide the flag without a value to use the default 1000 , or
use --threshold=N to set a specific limit.
Server-side validation
If the nomos vet command can't determine if the type is namespaced, the
nomos tool connects to the API Server of the current kubectl context. Because the nomos tool by default
understands core Kubernetes types and Config Sync CRDs, it only tries to
connect to the API Server if CRs don't have a corresponding declared
CRD. In this case, if the API Server does not have the CRD applied, the nomos
vet command returns error KNV1021 . To
disable this check and suppress errors from missing CRDs, pass the
--no-api-server-check flag.
Caching API server metadata
Instead of suppressing API server checks, you can cache the data on the API
server for the nomos vet command. To cache your api-resources , complete the following
steps:
Connect to a cluster which has all CRDs that you need for your source of truth.
The cluster does not need to have Config Sync enabled.
Go to the policyDir of your source of truth. This is the same directory specified
in your ConfigManagement or RootSync resource.
Run the following command: kubectl api-resources > api-resources.txt
This command creates a file called api-resources.txt that contains the exact
output of kubectl api-resources.
From now on, runs of nomos vet within the source of truth are aware of those type
definitions. If the api-resources.txt file is removed or renamed, nomos vet
cannot find the file. nomos vet will still attempt to connect to the cluster
if it finds manifests for types not declared in api-resources.txt
(unless --no-api-server-check is passed).
The api-resources.txt file only affects how the nomos tool works. It does not
modify the behavior of Config Sync in any way.
It's okay to have extra entries in the api-resources.txt file which are for
types that are not in the source of truth being validated. nomos vet imports the
definitions, but does nothing with them.
Caution: Custom types in a source of truth must either be namespaced or
not-namespaced. The nomos vet command does not support types which are
namespace-scoped in some clusters and cluster-scoped in others.
Update api-resources.txt
After ensuring all the CRDs that you want are on the cluster, run the following
command:
kubectl api-resources > api-resources.txt
Caution: Avoid directly editing api-resources.txt as it is easy to format
incorrectly and cause errors.
Automatically check for syntax errors when committing
If you commit a file with JSON or YAML errors, Config Sync does not
apply the change. However, you can prevent these types of errors from ever
getting into the source of truth by using client-side or
server-side hooks.
Use nomos vet in a pre-commit hook
You can configure a pre-commit hook that runs the nomos vet command to check
for syntax errors when you commit a change to the local Git clone of your repo.
If a pre-commit hook exits with a non-zero status, the git commit operation
fails.
Note: Pre-commit hooks run on the client, not the server. They must be
added manually to each client, and the user can bypass or disable them at any
time.
To run the nomos vet command as a pre-commit hook, edit the
.git/hooks/pre-commit file in your source of truth (notice that .git starts with a .
character). You may need to create the file manually. Add the nomos vet
command to a new line in the script. The --path argument is optional. Set the
--source-format argument to the source format of the repository.
nomos vet --path= /path/to/repo --source-format unstructured
Ensure that the pre-commit file is executable:
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
Now, when you run a git commit command in the clone of your source of truth,
nomos vet runs automatically.
The contents of the .git/ directory are not tracked by the
source of truth itself, and cannot be committed to the source of truth in the same
location. You can create a directory in the source of truth for Git hooks, and people
who use the source of truth can copy the hooks into the appropriate place in their
local clone.
Use nomos vet in a server-side hook
Git provides a mechanism for running checks at the server, rather than the
client, during a git push operation. If the check fails, the git push also
fails. These server-side hooks cannot be bypassed by the client. The method for
configuring server-side hooks depends on how your Git server is hosted. See one
of the following links for more information, or check the documentation for your
Git hosting service.
GitHub
Cloud Source Repositories
Bitbucket
GitLab
Self-hosted Git server
Enforce the maximum number of objects to sync
Config Sync stores a reference to each object it syncs in a ResourceGroup
inventory object, along with the object's current status. Because Kubernetes has
a byte size limit for resource objects, this limits the maximum number of
objects that Config Sync can sync with a single RootSync or RepoSync.
By default, the server-side etcd size limit is 1.5 MiB. For more details, see
the etcd documentation .
Applying an object larger than this limit causes one of the following errors,
depending on object size:
etcdserver: request is too large
rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = trying to send message larger than max
Request entity too large: limit is 3145728
To protect against ResourceGroup objects exceeding the Kubernetes size limit,
you can use the nomos vet --threshold to validate the number of objects in your
source repository.
By default, when you use the nomos vet command, the threshold is not enforced.
Passing the --threshold flag will cause the vet command to error if the
number of objects in your source repository exceeds the threshold.
The ResourceGroup inventory contains both object references and current object
status. It can grow especially large when the objects fail to sync or reconcile.
To avoid exceeding the Kubernetes object size limit, choose a threshold that
will leave enough capacity for object errors to be recorded. The default value
of 1000 should work for almost all cases, but you can raise or lower the
threshold as needed.
This threshold is only validated by the nomos vet command, not by
Config Sync itself. To enforce the threshold, use the
nomos vet --threshold command in a source repository presubmit check or
git pre-commit hook .
View all configs in the source of truth
You can use the nomos hydrate command to view the combined contents of
your source of truth on each enrolled cluster.
If you run nomos hydrate with no options, it creates a compiled/ directory
in the current working directory. Within that directory, a subdirectory is
created for each enrolled cluster, with the fully resolved configs the
Operator would apply to the cluster.
This command can also convert a hierarchical source of truth
to one or more unstructured sources of truth ,
using the content in the compiled/ directory.
nomos hydrate flags
To customize the nomos hydrate command, add the following flags:
Flag
Description
--api-server-timeout
Accepts a duration string. Sets the client-side timeout for talking to
the Kubernetes API server. Defaults to 15s .
--clusters
Accepts a comma-separated list of cluster names. Use this flag to limit
the output to a single cluster or a list of clusters. Defaults to all
clusters. Use "" for no clusters.
--flat
If enabled, print all output to a single file. Use this flag if you want
to emulate the behavior of nomos view .
--format
Accepts a yaml or json . The format of the
output. The default value is yaml .
-h or --help
Help for the nomos hydrate command.
--no-api-server-check
Accepts a Boolean. If true , disables talking to the API
server for discovery. For more information on this flag, see the
Server-side validation section.
--output
Accepts a string. The location to write hydrated configuration to. The
default is the compiled directory.
If --flat is not enabled, writes each resource manifest as a
separate file.
If --flat is enabled, writes to the, writes a single file
holding all resource manifests.
--path
Accepts a string. The path to the root directory of your Config Sync
source of truth. The default is " . "
--source-format
Accepts hierarchy or unstructured . If
hierarchy or unset, validates the source of truth as a
hierarchical source of truth . If
unstructured , validates the source of truth as an
unstructured source of truth .
This flag is required if you are using an unstructured source of truth.
Create a bug report
If you have a problem with Config Sync that requires help from
Google Cloud support , you can provide them with valuable
debugging information by using the nomos bugreport command. You can use this
command for a single source of truth and multiple repositories.
nomos bugreport
This command generates a timestamped zip file with information on the Kubernetes
cluster set in your kubectl context. The file also contains logs from
Config Sync Pods. It does not contain information from the resources synced
with Config Sync. For more information about the contents of the zip file,
see nomos bugreport reference .
Limitations
The nomos bugreport command fails and produces an incomplete zip file if
any individual file exceeds 1GiB. This often occurs due to large log files.
The following table includes the most common causes of large log files and how
you can resolve them:
Cause
Recommended action
Increased log verbosity
Reduce log verbosity with log level overrides
Very large objects
Unmanage the large object or reduce their size
Many objects
Split your repository into multiple repositories
Controller fights
Resolve the fighting
Migrate from a ConfigManagement object to a RootSync object
You can run the nomos migrate command to migrate from your ConfigManagement
object to a RootSync object to enable the RootSync and RepoSync APIs.
nomos migrate supports dry-run for previewing the migration process.
nomos migrate modifies your ConfigManagement object on the cluster directly.
To avoid changes made through nomos migrate being reverted, ensure the
ConfigManagement object isn't checked into your source of truth.
Note: Passing the --contexts flag specifies the contexts to migrate. This is
only necessary if you want to migrate clusters beyond the current context.
nomos migrate --contexts = KUBECONFIG_CONTEXTS --dry-run
If the dry-run result looks good, you can migrate your ConfigManagement object
by using nomos migrate :
nomos migrate --contexts = KUBECONFIG_CONTEXTS
The output is similar to the following:
--------------------
Enabling the multi-repo mode on cluster "my_managed_cluster-1" ...
- A RootSync object is generated and saved in "/tmp/nomos-migrate/my_managed_cluster-1/root-sync.yaml".
- The original ConfigManagement object is saved in "/tmp/nomos-migrate/my_managed_cluster-1/cm-original.yaml".
- The ConfigManagement object is updated and saved in "/tmp/nomos-migrate/my_managed_cluster-1/cm-multi.yaml".
- Resources for the multi-repo mode have been saved in a temp folder. If the migration process is terminated, it can be recovered manually by running the following commands:
kubectl apply -f /tmp/nomos-migrate/my_managed_cluster-1/cm-multi.yaml && \
kubectl wait --for condition=established crd rootsyncs.configsync.gke.io && \
kubectl apply -f /tmp/nomos-migrate/my_managed_cluster-1/root-sync.yaml.
- Updating the ConfigManagement object ....
- Waiting for the RootSync CRD to be established ....
- The RootSync CRD has been established.
- Creating the RootSync object ....
- Waiting for the reconciler-manager Pod to be ready ....
- Haven't detected running Pods with the label selector "app=reconciler-manager".
- Haven't detected running Pods with the label selector "app=reconciler-manager".
- Haven't detected running Pods with the label selector "app=reconciler-manager".
- The reconciler-manager Pod is running.
- Waiting for the root-reconciler Pod to be ready ....
- Haven't detected running Pods with the label selector "configsync.gke.io/reconciler=root-reconciler".
- Haven't detected running Pods with the label selector "configsync.gke.io/reconciler=root-reconciler".
- Haven't detected running Pods with the label selector "configsync.gke.io/reconciler=root-reconciler".
- The root-reconciler Pod is running.
- The migration process is done. Please check the sync status with `nomos status`.
Finished migration on all the contexts. Please check the sync status with `nomos status`.
Note: nomos migrate saves the original ConfigManagement object, the updated
ConfigManagement object, and the converted RootSync object to a temporary
directory. If nomos migrate fails or is terminated unexpectedly, you can
manually recover the migration by running the commands provided in
nomos migrate output.
Roll back to the previous configuration
If you need to roll back after performing the migration with nomos migrate ,
apply the original ConfigManagement object. nomos migrate
saves the original ConfigManagement object to a file and prints the name to the terminal.
The name of the file is of the form /tmp/nomos-migrate/ CURRENT_CONTEXT /cm-original.yaml .
To roll back to the previous configuration, copy the file path for
cm-original.yaml and apply the file to your cluster:
kubectl apply -f CM_ORIGINAL_PATH
nomos migrate flags
To customize the nomos migrate command, add the following flags:
Flag
Description
--connect-timeout
Accepts a duration. Timeout duration for connecting to each cluster.
Default to 3s .
--contexts
Accepts a comma-separated list of contexts to use in multi-cluster
environments. Defaults to the current context. Use "all" for
all contexts.
--dry-run
Accepts a boolean. If true , only prints the migration
output.
-h or --help
Help for the nomos migrate command.
--remove-configmanagement
Accepts a boolean. If true , migrates to OSS Config Sync
by removing the ConfigManagement Operator and the ConfigManagement CRD.
--wait-timeout
Accepts a duration. Timeout duration for waiting for Kubernetes
resources' conditions to be true. Defaults to 10m .
Initialize a hierarchical source of truth
You can organize your source of truth arbitrarily if you are using an
unstructured source of truth .
If you are using a hierarchical source of truth ,
you need to run the nomos init command to initialize a hierarchical directory:
nomos init
This creates the basic directory structure of a hierarchical source of truth, including the
system/ , cluster/ , and namespaces/ directories.
nomos init flags
To customize nomos init , add the following flags:
Flag
Description
--force
Write to directory even if nonempty, overwriting conflicting files
-h or --help
Help for the nomos init command.
--path
Accepts a string. The root directory to use for your
source of truth. The default value is "."
Troubleshooting
On Linux, you might see the following error when executing a nomos command:
failed to create client configs: while getting config path: failed to get current user: user: Current not implemented on linux/amd64
To fix this problem, create a USER environment variable:
export USER = $( whoami )
