About sources of truth

This document explains the different types of sources of truth that Config Sync
can sync from.
A key concept in GitOps workflows is the source of truth , a central
repository where your configuration files are stored. A configuration file
is typically a YAML or JSON file that defines Kubernetes resources. Normally, you
might manually apply Kubernetes objects with the kubectl command-line tool, but
Config Sync can automatically apply those resources from a single source
of truth like a Git repository. Config Sync then monitors your specified
source of truth and automatically applies any changes to your clusters.
Config Sync can sync configuration files from three different types of sources:
Git repositories, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and Helm charts. This document explains each of these
source types and how Config Sync interacts with them. Reading this document
can help you choose the best source option for your workflow and environment.
Git repositories
Git is widely adopted technology for version control and collaboration. With Git,
you can organize your repository in the way that suits your needs and get the
benefits of version control and branching, if needed. Because Git is a mature and
widely adopted technology, you get a variety of options for providers and tools.
When you configure Config Sync with a Git repository as the source of truth,
Config Sync uses a git-sync container within the reconciler Pod to pull
configs from the Git repository. You can configure the repository URL, branch,
and revision (commit or tag) for greater control over where to pull configs
within your Git repository.
Example RootSync configuration
The following example shows a RootSync manifest that syncs from a Git repository:
apiVersion : configsync.gke.io/v1beta1
kind : RootSync
metadata :
name : root-sync
namespace : config-management-system
spec :
sourceType : git
sourceFormat : unstructured
git :
repo : https://github.com/example/my-configs.git
revision : main
dir : cluster-configs
auth : none # replace with your authentication method such as ssh or token
period : 60s
This configuration sets up Config Sync to sync manifests from
a Git repository. Config Sync watches the cluster-configs directory in the
main branch of the https://github.com/example/my-configs.git repository,
checking for updates every 60 seconds using no authentication.
Example use case: Centralized management
Imagine that you are a platform administrator who wants to use a Git repository to
enforce baseline policies across all clusters in a fleet. In this scenario, you
might store standard NetworkPolicies , RoleBindings , and ResourceQuotas in
a central Git repository named standard-configs . When a new cluster is
provisioned, Config Sync is configured to sync from standard-configs repository,
helping to ensure all clusters meet organizational standards from the start.
OCI images
OCI images are a standard format for packaging
applications and their dependencies. This approach treats your configurations as
artifacts, similar to how you would treat container images. This approach offers
advantages like immutability and faster performance at scale. With OCI, you can
use container image infrastructure and tooling like Artifact Registry to manage your
images, and Workload Identity Federation for GKE to help simplify authentication.
Using OCI as a configuration source usually requires a separate process to
build your configuration files into an OCI image and then push it to a registry
platform like Artifact Registry. This approach can be less directly human-readable than
configurations stored as files in a Git repository.
When you configure Config Sync with an OCI image as the source of truth,
Config Sync uses an oci-sync container within the reconciler Pod to
pull the OCI image containing the configs from the registry.
Example RootSync configuration
The following example shows a RootSync manifest that syncs from an OCI
image stored in Artifact Registry:
apiVersion : configsync.gke.io/v1beta1
kind : RootSync
metadata :
name : root-sync
namespace : config-management-system
spec :
sourceType : oci
sourceFormat : unstructured
oci :
image : us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/my-config-image:v1.0.0
dir : .
auth : k8sserviceaccount
This configuration sets up Config Sync to sync from an OCI image.
Config Sync pulls the
us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/my-config-image:v1.0.0 image
from Artifact Registry using a Kubernetes service account for authentication.
Example use case: CI/CD pipeline integration
Imagine that you want to integrate OCI image creation into your organization's
CI/CD pipeline. When changes to configuration files are merged, you can set up
your pipeline to run validation tests (like the nomos vet command), build the YAML files
into an OCI image, and push the image to Artifact Registry. Config Sync would then
automatically detect and apply the new version of the image onto your clusters,
ensuring a validated and versioned rollout of all configuration changes.
Helm charts
Helm is a popular package manager for Kubernetes, which uses a packaging format
called charts. Config Sync can fetch, render, and sync resources defined in
Helm charts.
Helm offers a consistent way to package and reuse Kubernetes applications. You
can use templates or prebuilt Helm charts for consistent and reusable
configurations.
If you're not already familiar with Helm, the templating and release process can
add extra complexity to your configuration management pipeline.
When you configure Config Sync with a Helm chart as the source of truth,
Config Sync uses a helm-sync container within the reconciler Pod to pull
charts from a Helm repository (like Artifact Registry) or a Git repository, and then
renders the chart to produce Kubernetes manifests. Alternatively, you can use
Config Sync with Kustomize to render Helm charts. For more information about
this approach, see
Use Config Sync with Kustomize and Helm .
Example RootSync configuration
The following example shows a RootSync manifest that syncs from a Helm
chart stored in Artifact Registry:
apiVersion : configsync.gke.io/v1beta1
kind : RootSync
metadata :
name : root-sync
namespace : config-management-system
spec :
sourceType : helm
helm :
repo : oci://us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-helm-repo
chart : my-chart
version : 1.2.0
auth : gcpserviceaccount
gcpServiceAccountEmail : my-service-account@my-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
releaseName : my-chart-release
namespace : my-app-namespace # Namespace where the chart resources will be deployed
This configuration sets up Config Sync to sync a Helm chart from an OCI
repository. Config Sync fetches version 1.2.0 of my-chart chart from the
oci://us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-helm-repo repository, and it authenticates with
the my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com service account.
It deploys the chart's resources into the my-app-namespace namespace under the release name of
my-chart-release .
Example use case: Deploying a third-party application
Imagine that you are part of an application team that wants to deploy Prometheus
to a cluster. You can configure Config Sync to pull from a prebuilt Helm
chart that deploys Prometheus. Instead of manually running Helm commands, you
instead define the chart source, version, and any custom values within
Config Sync's RootSync or RepoSync object. Config Sync then keeps
the deployment in sync with the specified chart version and configurations.
Choosing a source type
The best source type depends on your team's existing tools, workflows, and
preferences. You can use this table to understand the key characteristics of
each source type to help you make an informed decision:

Git repository
OCI image
Helm chart
Best for
General purpose configuration management; flexibility; human-readability
Immutable, versioned configurations; leveraging container infrastructure
Packaging and distributing complex applications
Mutability

Tooling
Standard Git clients, CI/CD pipelines
Docker or Podman, container registries
Helm CLI, Helm repositories
Performance
Can be slower for large repositories
Faster, especially at scale
Fast when fetching from a chart repository
Authentication
Flexible (SSH, token), can be more complex to set up
Simplified with Workload Identity Federation for GKE (for example, with Artifact Registry)
Simplified with Workload Identity Federation for GKE (for example, with Artifact Registry)
It's also possible to use different source types for different purposes on the
same cluster. For example, a cluster might have the following:
A RootSync syncing from a Git repository containing base cluster-wide
resources and policies managed by the platform team.
A RepoSync in a specific namespace syncing from a Helm chart to deploy
a Redis instance managed by an application team.
Another RepoSync in a different namespace syncing from an OCI image
containing a set of application-specific configurations built by a separate
CI/CD process.
