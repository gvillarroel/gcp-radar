Config Sync architecture
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page introduces you to the architecture of Config Sync, including the
hosted components that run in Google Cloud and the open source components that
run on your Google Kubernetes Engine cluster. Learning about the architecture can
give you a deeper understanding of Config Sync and might help you debug and
fix issues that you encounter.
The following section shows the architecture of Config Sync, including its
components and dependencies, both in Google Cloud and on your
GKE cluster:
The
Fleet service
manages the Config Sync components on your cluster directly, without the
legacy ConfigManagement Operator or ConfigManagement object. You must manually
upgrade Config Sync as needed.
There are multiple steps to install Config Sync
and each of these steps deploys additional components on your cluster:
Enabling Config Sync on your cluster adds the following components:
The ConfigSync custom resource definition (CRD)
A ConfigSync object named config-sync .
The Reconciler Manager in a Deployment named reconciler-manager .
The ResourceGroup Controller in a Deployment named resource-group-controller-manager .
The OpenTelemetry Collector in
a Deployment named otel-collector .
Optional: The Config Sync admission webhook in a Deployment named
admission-webhook . The Config Sync admission webhook is only
installed if you enable
drift prevention .
These resources and objects are automatically created when you install
Config Sync and shouldn't be modified directly.
Creating RootSync and RepoSync objects adds the following
components:
For each RootSync object, a reconciler Deployment named
root-reconciler- ROOTSYNC_NAME . For the RootSync
object named root-sync , the reconciler Deployment is named
root-reconciler .
For each RepoSync object, a reconciler Deployment named
ns-reconciler- REPOSYNC_NAMESPACE - REPOSYNC_NAME - REPOSYNC_NAME_LENGTH .
For the RepoSync object named repo-sync , the reconciler Deployment
is named ns-reconciler- REPOSYNC_NAMESPACE .
Note: A validation webhook enforces the 63-character limit by checking
the potential maximum length of the reconciler name:
ns-reconciler- REPOSYNC_NAMESPACE - REPOSYNC_NAME - REPOSYNC_NAME_LENGTH .
This limit is enforced even if you use the default RepoSync
name.

Key components
The following sections explore important Config Sync components in greater
detail.
Fleet service and the ConfigSync object
The Hub Fleet service
manages the Config Sync components on your cluster:
The Fleet service also manages the ConfigSync object on your cluster. The
Fleet service updates both the ConfigSync object's spec based on your inputs
to the Google Cloud API and its status to reflect the status of the
Config Sync components.
To make changes to your Config Sync installation configuration, you must
use the Google Cloud API. But you can use either the Google Cloud
API or the Kubernetes API to monitor the configuration and health of your
Config Sync installation.
Reconciler Manager and reconcilers
The Reconciler Manager is responsible for creating and managing the individual
reconcilers that ensure your cluster configuration stays in sync.
The Reconciler Manager creates a root reconciler for every RootSync object and
a namespace reconciler for every RepoSync object. Config Sync uses this
design instead of sharing a single monolithic reconciler because it improves
reliability by reducing single points of failure and allows for individual
reconcilers to be scaled independently.
Root and namespace reconcilers automatically fetch configs from your source of
truth and apply them to enforce the state that you want within your cluster.
The following diagrams show how the Reconciler Manager handles controlling the
lifecycle of each root reconciler and namespace reconciler:
Reconciler containers
The specific containers deployed in the reconciler Pods depend on the
configuration choices you make. The following table explains more about what
each of these reconciler containers do and the condition that causes
Config Sync to create them:
Container name
Description
Condition
reconciler
Handles syncing and drift remediation.
Always enabled.
otel-agent
Receives metrics from the other reconciler containers and sends them to the
OpenTelemetry Collector.
Always enabled.
git-sync
Pulls configs from your Git repository to a local directory that the
reconciler container can read.
Enabled when spec.sourceType is git .
helm-sync
Pulls and renders Helm charts from your chart repository to a local
directory that the reconciler container can read.
Enabled when spec.sourceType is helm .
oci-sync
Pulls OCI images containing your configs from your container registry to a
local directory that the reconciler container can read.
Enabled when spec.sourceType is oci .
gcenode-askpass-sidecar
Caches Git credentials from the GKE metadata service for
use by the git-sync container.
Enabled when spec.sourceType is git and
spec.git.auth is gcenode or
gcpserviceaccount .
hydration-controller
Handles building Kustomize configurations to a local directory that the
reconciler container can read.
Enabled when the source includes a kustomize.yaml file.
As shown in the preceding table, you can typically expect a container count of
three to five within each reconciler Pod. The reconciler and otel-agent
containers are always present. Specifying a type for your source of truth
dictates which sync container is added. Additionally, the hydration-controller
and gcenode-askpass-sidecar containers are created if you made the
configuration changes mentioned in the table.
Reconciler resource requests
For each RootSync and RepoSync object, Config Sync creates an
independent reconciler deployment to handle syncing. The reconciler deployment
consists of multiple containers. For more information about these containers,
see Reconciler containers .
The resource requests are the same for all supported versions of Config Sync.

Bundled Helm and Kustomize versions
Config Sync leverages the Helm and Kustomize executables to render the
configurations. The following table provides a list of
Config Sync versions that support the rendering feature, alongside the
bundled Helm and Kustomize versions.

v3.15.3
v5.3.0
For information about rendering Helm through Kustomize, see
Configure Kubernetes with Kustomize . For
information about using the Helm API, see
Sync Helm charts from Artifact Registry .
ResourceGroup Controller and ResourceGroup objects
The root and namespace reconcilers create a ResourceGroup inventory object for
each RootSync and RepoSync object you set up. Each ResourceGroup object
contains a list of objects synced to the cluster from the source of truth by the
reconciler for that RootSync or RepoSync object. The ResourceGroup
Controller then watches all the objects in the ResourceGroup object and
updates the status of the ResourceGroup object with the current reconciliation
status of the synced objects. This lets you check the status of the ResourceGroup
object
for an overview of the sync status, instead of having to query the status of
every individual object yourself.
ResourceGroup objects have the same name and namespace as their corresponding
RootSync or RepoSync object. For example, for the RootSync object with the
name root-sync in the namespace config-management-system , the corresponding
ResourceGroup object is also named root-sync in the
config-management-system namespace.
Don't create or modify ResourceGroup objects, as this can interfere with
the operation of Config Sync.
Admission Webhook
The Config Sync Admission Webhook is created when you enable
drift prevention . Drift prevention
proactively intercepts modification requests, ensuring they align with the
source of truth before allowing changes.
If you don't enable drift prevention, Config Sync still uses a self-healing
mechanism to revert configuration drift. With self-healing, Config Sync
continuously monitors managed objects and automatically reverses any changes
that deviate from the intended state.
RootSync and RepoSync objects
RootSync objects configure Config Sync to create a root reconciler that
watches the specified source of truth and apply objects from that source to the
cluster. By default, the root reconciler for each RootSync object has cluster-admin permission. With
this default permission, root reconcilers can sync both cluster-scoped and
namespace-scoped resources. If needed, you can change these permissions by
configuring the
spec.override.roleRefs
fields. RootSync objects are designed for use by cluster admins.
RepoSync objects configure Config Sync to create a namespace reconciler
that watches the specified source and apply objects from that source to a
specific namespace in the cluster. Namespace reconcilers can sync any
namespace-scoped resources in that namespace with custom user-specified
permissions. RepoSync objects are designed for use by namespace tenants.
How the Fleet service manages RootSync objects
When you install Config Sync with the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI,
Config Connector, or Terraform, Config Sync is managed by the Fleet service,
based on your inputs to the Google Cloud API.
When your Config Sync installation is managed by the Fleet service, you can
optionally also have it manage your initial RootSync object, named
root-sync . This lets you bootstrap GitOps on your cluster without needing to
manually apply anything to the cluster directly. If you decide not to have the
Fleet service manage your initial RootSync object, you can still apply
whatever RootSync and RepoSync objects you want directly to the cluster.
The RootSync object named root-sync is created based on your inputs to the
Google Cloud API, specifically the spec.configSync section of the
config-management apply
API . Because this API
only exposes a subset of the RootSync
fields ,
those fields are considered managed in the root-sync , while the other fields
are considered unmanaged. Managed fields can only be edited using the
Google Cloud API. The unmanaged
fields
can be edited using kubectl ,
or any other Kubernetes client.
Additional RootSync and RepoSync objects
To create additional RootSync or RepoSync objects, you can use the kubectl
command-line tool or another Kubernetes client. You can also use the initial
root-sync object to manage additional RootSync or RepoSync objects with
GitOps, by adding their YAML manifests to the source of truth that the
root-sync is configured to sync from. This method cannot be used to manage the
config of the initial root-sync , because some of its fields are managed by the
Fleet service. To manage the root-sync object with GitOps, use Config Connector or
Terraform. For more information about creating additional RootSync and
RepoSync objects, see
Configure syncing from more than one source of truth .
