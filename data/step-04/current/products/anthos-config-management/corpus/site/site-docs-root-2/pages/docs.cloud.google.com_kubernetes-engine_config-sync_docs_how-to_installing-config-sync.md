Customize your Config Sync installation
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
With Config Sync, you can manage your Kubernetes resources by syncing
configurations from a central source of truth, such as a Git repository, an OCI
image, or a Helm chart. If the default installation instructions
don't suit your needs, you might need to customize your Config Sync installation.
This page shows you how to perform an advanced installation and configuration of
Config Sync. The installation process includes the following:
Installing Config Sync on individual clusters using the
Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, or Terraform.
Configuring your root repository, including source type, format, and
authentication.
Verifying the successful installation and configuration of Config Sync.
Limitations
Config Sync doesn't support configuring helm as the source type
using the Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI. You can configure your
RootSync or RepoSync object to sync from a Helm repository using the
Kubernetes API , or
declare it in another source of truth .
See
Configuration for the Helm repository
for more information.
Before you begin
Before you install Config Sync, prepare your source of truth and a suitable cluster.
Grant Config Sync access to your source of truth
To synchronize configuration from a source of truth to your clusters,
Config Sync requires read-only access to your repository. To authorize
Config Sync to read your configurations, complete the following steps:
Create, or have access to, a source of truth that contains the configuration
files that you want Config Sync to sync to your clusters. For more information, see the
following resources:
Add configs to a source of truth : conceptual information about configurations.
GitOps best practices : tips and general best practices for organizing and managing your repository.
Use an unstructured repo : recommendations for using and organizing an unstructured repository.
If your source of truth is public, no further action is needed.
Config Sync doesn't require extra permissions.
If your source of truth is private, complete the instructions in one of the following pages:
Grant Config Sync access to Git .
Grant Config Sync access to OCI or Helm .
Review cluster requirements
Before you create a cluster, review
cluster requirements .
Install Config Sync
When you install Config Sync using the Google Cloud console or the
Google Cloud CLI, Config Sync automatically creates a RootSync object named
root-sync . You can use kubectl commands to modify root-sync and add
additional Config Sync configurations. For more information, see
Configure Config Sync with kubectl commands .
Console
Install Config Sync
To install Config Sync, all clusters must be registered to a fleet.
When you install Config Sync in the Google Cloud console, selecting individual
clusters automatically registers those clusters to your fleet.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Config page under the Features section.
Go to Config
Click add Install Config Sync .
Select the Config Sync version that you want to use.
Under Installation options , select one of the following options:
Install Config Sync on entire fleet (recommended) : Config Sync
is installed on all clusters in the fleet.
Install Config Sync on individual clusters : Config Sync is
installed on the clusters that you select. Any selected clusters are automatically registered to your fleet.
If you're installing Config Sync on individual clusters, in the
Available clusters table, select the clusters on which you want to install Config Sync.
Click Install Config Sync . In the Settings tab, after a few minutes,
you should see Enabled in the Status column for the clusters in your fleet.
Deploy a package
After you have registered your clusters to a fleet and installed Config Sync,
you can configure Config Sync to deploy a package to a cluster from a
source of truth . You can deploy the same package
to multiple clusters or deploy different packages to different clusters.
You can edit a package after deploying it, except for some settings like
package name and sync type. For more information, see
Manage packages .
Note: If you want Config Sync to render and apply a Helm chart, you must
configure Config Sync with the Google Cloud CLI instead.
To deploy a package, complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Config Sync dashboard .
Go to Config Sync dashboard
Click Deploy Package .
In the Select clusters for package deployment table, select the cluster
that you want to deploy a package to and then click Continue .
Select either Package hosted on Git or Package hosted on OCI as
your source type and then click Continue .
In the Package details section, enter a Package name , which
identifies the RootSync or RepoSync object.
In the Sync type field, choose either Cluster scoped sync or Namespace scoped sync as
the sync type.
Cluster scoped sync creates a RootSync object and Namespace scoped sync creates a RepoSync object.
For more information about these objects, see
Config Sync architecture .
In the Source section, complete the following:
For sources hosted in a Git repository, enter the following fields:
Enter the URL of the Git repository that you're using as a source of truth
as the Repository URL .
Optional: Update the Revision field to check out if you're not using
the default HEAD .
Optional: Update the Path field if you don't want to sync from the
root repository.
Optional: Update the Branch field if you're not using the default
main branch.
For sources hosted in an OCI image, enter the following fields:
Enter the URL of the OCI image that you're using as a source of truth
as the Image .
Enter the path of the directory to sync from,
relative to the root directory, as the Directory .
(Optional): Expand the Advanced settings section to complete the following:
Select an Authentication type . Config Sync needs read-only access to
your source of truth to read the configuration files in the source and apply them to your clusters.
Unless your source requires no authentication, such as a public repository,
ensure that you grant Config Sync
read-only access to your Git repository ,
OCI image , or Helm chart (gcloud CLI only).
Choose the same authentication type that you configured when you installed
Config Sync:
Note: for OCI, you can only select Workload Identity for authentication.
None : Use no authentication.
SSH : Authenticate by using an SSH key pair.
Cookiefile : Authenticate by using a cookiefile .
Token : Authenticate by using an access token or password.
Google Cloud Repository : Use a Google service account to access a
Cloud Source Repositories repository. Only select this option if
Workload Identity Federation for GKE is not enabled in your cluster.
Workload Identity : Use a Google service account to access a
Cloud Source Repositories repository.
Enter a number in seconds to set the Sync wait time , which determines
how long Config Sync waits between attempts to pull from the source of truth.
Enter a Git proxy URL for the HTTPS proxy to be used when
communicating with the source of truth.
Click Deploy Package .
You are redirected to the Config Sync Packages page. After a few
minutes, you should see Synced in the Sync status
column for the cluster that you configured.
gcloud
Before you continue, make sure you've
registered your clusters
to a fleet .
Enable the ConfigManagement fleet feature:
gcloud beta container fleet config-management enable
Prepare the configuration by creating a file named apply-spec.yaml and
copying the following YAML file into it.
You can set all of the optional spec.configSync fields that you need
when you create your manifest, and later use
kubectl commands for configuration .
You can also only set the spec.configSync.enabled field as true and
omit the optional fields. You can then later use kubectl commands to
create additional RootSync objects
or RepoSyncs that you can fully manage using kubectl commands later.
# apply-spec.yaml
applySpecVersion : 1
spec :
configSync :
enabled : true
# If you don't have a source of truth yet, omit the
# following fields. You can configure them later.
sourceType : SOURCE_TYPE
sourceFormat : FORMAT
syncRepo : REPO
syncRev : REVISION
secretType : SECRET_TYPE
gcpServiceAccountEmail : EMAIL
metricsGcpServiceAccountEmail : METRICS_EMAIL
policyDir : DIRECTORY
preventDrift : false
Replace the following:
SOURCE_TYPE : add git to sync from a Git repository,
oci to sync from an OCI image, or helm to sync from a Helm chart.
If no value is specified, the default is git .
FORMAT : add unstructured to use an
unstructured repository or add
hierarchy to use a
hierarchical repository .
These values are case-sensitive.
This field is optional and the default value is
hierarchy . We recommend that you add unstructured , because this format
lets you organize your configs in the way that is most convenient to
you.
REPO : add the URL of the source of truth.
Git and Helm repository URLs use either the HTTPS or SSH protocol. For
example, https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-config-management-samples . If you plan to use SSH as your secretType ,
enter your URL with the SSH protocol. This field is required and if you
don't enter a protocol, the URL is treated as an HTTPS URL.
OCI URLs use the following format:
LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / PACKAGE_NAME .
By default, the image is pulled from the latest tag, but you can
pull in images by TAG or DIGEST instead. Specify TAG or DIGEST
in the PACKAGE_NAME :
To pull by TAG : LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / PACKAGE_NAME :TAG
To pull by DIGEST : LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / PACKAGE_NAME @sha256:DIGEST
Caution: Config Sync requires that the OCI layer is compressed in
the tar or tar+gzip format.
Other formats (for example, tar+bz2 ) won't be recognized by
Config Sync. Switching from a valid REPO to an OCI image with an
unsupported format will cause managed resources to be pruned without
an error.
REVISION : the Git revision (tag or hash)
or branch name to sync from. When using a hash, it must be a full
hash, and not an abbreviated form.
SECRET_TYPE : one of the following secretTypes :
git
none : Use no authentication.
ssh : Use an SSH key pair.
cookiefile : Use a cookiefile .
token : Use a token.
gcpserviceaccount : Use a Google service account to access a
Cloud Source Repositories or Secure Source Manager repository. If you select this
authentication type, you need to create an IAM policy binding after
you finish configuring Config Sync. For details, see the Google
service account tab of the
Grant Config Sync access to Git with a Google service account
section.
gcenode : Use a Google service account to access a
Cloud Source Repositories. Only select this option if Workload Identity Federation for GKE
is not enabled in your cluster.
githubapp : Use a GitHub App to authenticate to a GitHub repository.
For more information on these authentication types, see
Grant Config Sync access to Git .
oci
none : Use no authentication
gcenode : Use the Compute Engine default service account to
access an image in Artifact Registry. Only select
this option if Workload Identity Federation for GKE is not enabled in your cluster.
gcpserviceaccount : Use a Google service account to access an
image.
helm
token : Use a token.
gcenode : Use the Compute Engine default service account to
access an image in Artifact Registry. Only select
this option if Workload Identity Federation for GKE is not enabled in your cluster.
gcpserviceaccount : Use a Google service account to access an
image.
EMAIL : If you added
gcpserviceaccount as your secretType , add your Google service
account email address. For example,
acm@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
METRICS_EMAIL : the email of the Google Cloud
Service Account (GSA) used for exporting Config Sync metrics to
Cloud Monitoring. The GSA should have the Monitoring Metric Writer
( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) IAM role.
The Kubernetes ServiceAccount default in the namespace
config-management-monitoring should be
bound to the GSA .
DIRECTORY : the path of the directory to sync from,
relative to the root of the Git repository. All sub-directories of the
directory that you specify are included and synced to the cluster. The
default value is the root directory of the repository.
For a complete list of fields that you can add to the spec field,
see gcloud fields .
Note: If you don't have a source of truth prepared yet, you can enable
Config Sync without configuring any settings by setting
spec.configSync.enabled to true and omitting all other
spec.configSync fields. When you have prepared your repository, edit
your apply-spec.yaml to add the configuration settings.
Apply the apply-spec.yaml file. If you are using an existing manifest,
you should apply the file to the cluster that you want to
configure with the settings that you fetched in the previous command:
gcloud beta container fleet config-management apply \
--membership = MEMBERSHIP_NAME \
--config = CONFIG_YAML_PATH \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
MEMBERSHIP_NAME : the fleet membership name that you chose
when you registered your cluster. You can find the name with
gcloud container fleet memberships list .
CONFIG_YAML_PATH : the path to your
apply-spec.yaml file.
PROJECT_ID : your project ID.
Terraform
For each cluster that you want to configure Config Sync,
apply a google_gkehub_feature_membership resource block that contains
a configmanagement and config_sync block, such as in the following example:
git
data "google_project" "default" {}
resource "google_container_cluster" "default" {
name = "gke-autopilot-basic"
location = "us-central1"
fleet {
project = data.google_project.default.project_id
}
enable_autopilot = true
}
resource "google_gke_hub_feature" "configmanagement_feature" {
name = "configmanagement"
location = "global"
}
resource "google_gke_hub_feature_membership" "configmanagement_feature_member" {
location = "global"
feature = google_gke_hub_feature.configmanagement_feature.name
membership = google_container_cluster.default.fleet[0].membership_id
membership_location = google_container_cluster.default.fleet[0].membership_location
configmanagement {
config_sync {
# The field `enabled` was introduced in Terraform version 5.41.0, and
# needs to be set to `true` explicitly to install Config Sync.
enabled = true
git {
sync_repo = " REPO "
sync_branch = " BRANCH "
policy_dir = " DIRECTORY "
secret_type = " SECRET "
}
}
}
}
Replace the following:
REPO : the URL to the Git repository that contains your configuration files.
BRANCH : the repository branch, for example main .
DIRECTORY : the path within the Git repository that represents the top level of the repository you want to sync.
SECRET : the secret auth type.
oci
data "google_project" "default" {}
resource "google_container_cluster" "default" {
name = "gke-autopilot-basic"
location = "us-central1"
fleet {
project = data.google_project.default.project_id
}
enable_autopilot = true
}
resource "google_gke_hub_feature" "configmanagement_feature" {
name = "configmanagement"
location = "global"
}
resource "google_gke_hub_feature_membership" "configmanagement_feature_member" {
location = "global"
feature = google_gke_hub_feature.configmanagement_feature.name
membership = google_container_cluster.default.fleet[0].membership_id
membership_location = google_container_cluster.default.fleet[0].membership_location
configmanagement {
config_sync {
# The field `enabled` was introduced in Terraform version 5.41.0, and
# needs to be set to `true` explicitly to install Config Sync.
enabled = true
oci {
sync_repo = " REPO "
policy_dir = " DIRECTORY "
secret_type = " SECRET "
}
}
}
}
Replace the following:
REPO : the URL to the OCI image repository that contains your configuration files.
DIRECTORY : the absolute path of the directory containing the resources you want to sync. To use the root directory, leave this field blank.
SECRET : the secret auth type.
Repeat this process for each cluster that you want to sync.
For more information about using Terraform, see Terraform support for
Config Sync .
After you configure your root repository, you can optionally
configure syncing from multiple repositories ,
including other root repositories and namespace repositories. The namespace
repositories are helpful if you want a repository that contains namespace-scoped
configs synced to a particular namespace across clusters.
Verify the installation
After you install and configure Config Sync, you can verify
that the installation completed successfully.
gcloud
Run the following command:
nomos status
A successful installation shows a status of SYNCED or PENDING .
For more details about the information supplied by nomos status , including
reported errors, see Check Config Sync status
in the nomos command-line tool documentation.
console
Complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Config page under the Features section.
Go to Config
On the Packages tab, check the Sync status column in the cluster table.
A successful installation of Config Sync has a status of Installed .
A successfully configured source of truth has a status of Synced .
Override resource requests and limits
In most cases, the
default resource requests and limits
for Config Sync components are sufficient. However, you can override the
requests and limits for the default CPU and memory to ensure that components
have enough resources to operate reliably. For example, if you are syncing a
large number of resources to your cluster, you might need to provide more
resources to the reconciler-manager .
You can override the resource requests and limits for some Config Sync
components by using the deploymentOverrides field in your apply-spec.yaml file
when you install Config Sync with the gcloud CLI. You can't
use the deploymentOverrides field to override other fields in a Deployment,
such as the number of replicas.
The deploymentOverrides field can only override the resource requests
and limits for deployments that are not a root or namespace reconciler, such as
the reconciler-manager . If you need to override the resources for a
root or namespace reconciler, you can use the spec.override.resources field in the
RootSync or RepoSync object.
The following example shows how to use the deploymentOverrides field to set a
new CPU request and limit and a new memory request and limit for the
reconciler-manager container:
applySpecVersion : 1
spec :
configSync :
enabled : true
# ... other fields...
deploymentOverrides :
- name : reconciler-manager
namespace : config-management-system
containers :
- name : reconciler-manager
cpuRequest : 50m
cpuLimit : 100m
memoryRequest : 256Mi
memoryLimit : 512Mi
After you have create your apply-spec.yaml file, apply it by running the following command:
gcloud beta container fleet config-management apply \
--membership = MEMBERSHIP_NAME \
--config = apply-spec.yaml \
--project = PROJECT_ID
For a complete list of the fields that you can override, see the
gcloud apply spec fields reference documentation .
