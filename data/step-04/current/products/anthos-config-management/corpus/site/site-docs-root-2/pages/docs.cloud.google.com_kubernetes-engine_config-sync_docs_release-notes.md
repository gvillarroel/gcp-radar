Breaking
Installing Policy Controller through the ConfigManagement API is no longer supported. For instructions installing Policy Controller, see Installing Policy Controller . For instructions migrating existing Policy Controller instances, see Migrate from the ConfigManagement API to the PolicyController API . This note was added on May 16, 2025.
1.21.0
Fixed
Fixed an issue impacting the Ignore object mutations feature. The client.lifecycle.config.k8s.io/mutation: ignore annotation was not always effective, causing Config Sync to potentially overwrite changes made directly to annotated resources in the cluster. Config Sync now correctly ignores mutations on these resources.
1.21.0
Feature
The nomos vet command now supports a --threshold flag to proactively validate the number of objects in your Config Sync repository. You can use this flag in validation pipelines to prevent sync failures caused by exceeding the underlying etcd size limits when your repository contains a large number of objects. For more information, see Enforce the maximum number of objects to sync .
1.21.0
Breaking
The Config Sync auto-upgrades feature is now unavailable. You can no longer configure auto-upgrade settings and must manually upgrade the Config Sync version . If you currently use auto-upgrades, you must first
disable auto-upgrades
before you can manually update Config Sync.
1.21.0
Breaking
Upgraded the Open Telemetry Collector image from v0.103.0 to v0.118.0. This upgrade includes a breaking change where the default OTLP component endpoint is now localhost instead of 0.0.0.0 . You will be impacted only if you use a customized configuration for the built-in Otel Collector within Config Sync, and you can explicitly specify 0.0.0.0 for endpoints to ensure that your monitoring solution continues to function correctly. To understand the changes in each release, review the full changelog for opentelemetry-collector-contrib .

December 05, 2024
1.20.0
Breaking
Improved the manual installation process for Config Sync. When you install Config Sync manually using kubectl (not recommended) , Config Sync is now deployed directly without relying on the Config Management Operator. This change results in simplified architecture and reduced resource use on your cluster. If you manually installed Config Sync using kubectl, follow the guide to uninstall the Config Management Operator before you upgrade.
1.20.0
Breaking
Hierarchy Controller is no longer available to install. If Hierarchy Controller is still configured, Config Sync upgrades are blocked. To upgrade Config Sync, disable Hierarchy Controller . This release note was updated on May 9, 2025. The previous note suggested Hierarchical Namespace Controller (HNC) as a migration option, but HNC is now archived.
1.20.0
Feature
When you use Config Sync to manage configurations that are stored in OCI repositories (such as Artifact Registry), you can now enhance your security posture with custom signature verification. Config Sync integrates with your existing signature verification server deployed as a Kubernetes admission webhook, which helps ensure only trusted OCI images are used in your deployments. See the Sync OCI artifacts guide for setup instructions.
1.20.0
Feature
Introduced a new field for stopping and resuming syncing. This field is available on clusters with Config Sync auto-upgrades or with Config Sync version 1.20.0. The new field makes it easier to pause syncing by setting the spec.configSync.stopSyncing field to true .
1.20.0
Fixed
Fixed an issue that could cause sync delays due to retry backoff problems. This fix helps ensure more timely and consistent updates to your clusters.
1.20.0
Fixed
Upgraded the git-sync dependency from v4.2.4 to v4.3.0 to pick up a fix for lingering Git lock files and other vulnerability fixes.
1.20.0
Change
To optimize resource use, Config Sync installations managed through Fleet no longer include the ConfigManagement Operator or the ConfigManagement CRD. These components are automatically removed when you upgrade to version 1.20.0 or later. This change reduces Config Sync's resource consumption in your cluster. See Config Sync architecture for details.
1.20.0
Fixed
Fixed a bug that prevented the applyset.kubernetes.io/part-of label from being correctly removed from managed objects when they were no longer managed by Config Sync. This fix improves the accuracy of label information.
October 17, 2024

August 29, 2024
1.19.0
Breaking
The spec.git and spec.enableLegacyFields fields of the ConfigManagement object have been removed. The spec.enableMultiRepo field is now set to true by default, automatically enabling the RootSync API. RootSync provides the same core functionality, along with additional features.
If you currently configure Git settings within a ConfigManagement object, to avoid disruptions, before upgrading you must migrate this configuration to a RootSync object .
1.19.0
Breaking
Terraform version 5.41.0 introduced a new field to the google_gke_hub_feature_membership : config_sync.enabled . Because the default value of this field is false , it causes Config Sync installations to fail when Terraform is upgraded to version 5.41.0. For more information, including workarounds, see the known issue entry . This issue affects all supported Config Sync versions. This note was added on September 11, 2024.
1.19.0
Announcement
Hierarchy Controller will not be available after December, 2024. After December, 2024, you can't install Hierarchy Controller and Config Sync will be blocked from upgrades if Hierarchy Controller is configured as a configmanagement fleet feature or through the ConfigManagement API. To continue using similar functionality, migrate from Hierarchy Controller to Hierarchical Namespace Controller .
This note was added on September 6, 2024 and edited on September 9, 2024 for clarification.
1.19.0

Config Sync supports syncing configurations stored as OCI images in Google Artifact Registry or Container Registry as a preview feature. To learn more, see Publish config images to Artifact Registry .
1.12.0
Feature
Added a field spec.override.reconcileTimeout in RootSync and RepoSync,
for configuring the threshold for how long to wait for resources in an apply group to reconcile before giving up. An apply group consists of resources without direct or indirect dependencies on each others.
1.12.0
Change
This release includes several Config Sync performance improvements:
Config Sync reconciler now watches resources for status updates instead of polling, leading to faster, more responsive, and more efficient detection of object failure and reconciliation. This change also significantly reduces memory allocations for unchanged objects.
Disable client-side throttling when server-side throttling is enabled (enabled by default on Kubernetes v1.20 and later). This significantly reduced sync latency at scale.
1.12.0
Change
The template library's K8sNoExternalServices template supports a new field: cloudPlatform .
1.12.0
Breaking
Shell access is disabled by default in the Config Sync hydration-controller container. This disables the ability to use Kustomize remote bases. To use Kustomize remote bases, enable shell access by setting the field spec.override.enableShellInRendering: true in RootSync and RepoSync.
1.12.0
Change
Config Sync removed resource limits from reconciler-manager , reconciler , and git-importer to make them burstable.

1.12.0
Fixed
Fixed the issue causing the Config Sync webhook deployment to report readiness prematurely by adding a readiness probe that waits for the TLS certificate to be generated and injected by the sidecar.
1.12.0
Fixed
Fixed two issues when resources are marked unmanaged using the configmanagement.gke.io/managed: disabled annotation:
If a repo contains unmanaged resources on the initial sync, the sync fails.
If a resource was deleted in the same commit where another resource is marked unmanaged, the deleted resource is not properly pruned.
May 19, 2022

1.7.2
Change
Increased reconciler memory limit to 300Mi.
1.7.2
Issue
The output of the nomos hydrate command does not pass nomos vet and cannot be synced using Config Sync without modifying the output. To work around this, we recommend removing the following annotations: configmanagement.gke.io/cluster-name , configmanagement.gke.io/source-path and removing label configsync.gke.io/declared-version
from the output so that the output can be successfully synced.
1.7.2
Change
Hierarchy Controller has been updated to use HNC v0.8.0.
1.7.2
Issue
The nomos hydrate command attempts to connect to the API Server even if --no-api-server-check is passed. This behavior can be safely ignored in CI as if the CLI is unable to connect to the API Server it will not produce errors resulting from being unable to connect.
May 20, 2021
1.7.0

For more information, see Error: reconciler deployments failed to be upgraded
.
1.6.2
Issue
Config Sync multi-repo mode can't sync Git repositories using ssh as the authentication method. If this issue affects you, please contact support so we can suggest ways to handle your required use cases while we correct this issue.
January 28, 2021
1.6.1
Issue
Anthos Config Management Operator and Config Sync Pods get high memory utilization or OOMKilled due to memory leak.
1.6.1
Fixed
The nomos status output has been fixed for multi-repo clusters to distinctly show status of multiple namespace repos synced to the clusters.
1.6.1
Feature
Hierarchy Controller is upgraded to include HNC v0.7.0. This release introduces Exceptions . Exceptions let you use Kubernetes label selectors to precisely control where certain objects are propagated.
This release also removes support for the v1alpha1 API. If you were using Hierarchy Controller 1.5.1 or earlier, you must either update to Hierarchy Controller 1.5.2 or 1.6.0, and follow the HNC v0.6.0 directions to upgrade to v1alpha2.
1.6.1
Fixed
The nomos status output has been fixed for multi-repo clusters to show git.syncBranch when git.syncRev is not specified ( git.syncRev defaults to HEAD) to provide a consistent experience with mono-repo clusters.
January 08, 2021
1.6.0
Issue
Config Sync unintentionally started using the absolute path in the file system with spec.git.policyDir . This has no effect on Config Sync running on the cluster, but breaks validation when running nomos vet manually against hierarchical repositories. The issue will be corrected in 1.6.1.
December 10, 2020
1.6.0
Feature
Anthos Policy Controller now includes additional policies covering many of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark 1.5.1 controls. To learn more, see the Constraint template library .

1.6.0
Fixed
Support for Git submodules has been fixed in this version.
November 16, 2020
1.5.2
Issue
A leading forward slash "/" in spec.git.policyDir will not match anything in Config Sync versions 1.5.2 and 1.6.0. For example:
policyDir: "/dirname"
will not match a top-level directory dirname . Because policyDir is always applied at the top of the directory structure, the workaround is to remove the leading forward slash.
This issue has been corrected in Config Sync 1.6.1; the forward slash will be ignored as it was in 1.5.1 and previous versions.
1.5.2
Fixed
The default timeout for Policy Controller's ValidatingWebhookConfiguration has been reduced to avoid interference with Kubernetes leader election processes.
1.5.2
Issue
There is an issue where enabling referential constraints does not take effect for the audit container. This affects Anthos Config Management versions 1.5.0, 1.5.1, and 1.5.2.
1.5.2
Change
Hierarchy Controller is upgraded to include HNC v0.6.0 . This release introduces support for v1alpha2, and will automatically update all your existing HNC objects. We recommend backing up these objects before upgrading in case there are any problems with the upgrade process. For more information, see the release notes for HNC v0.6.0 .

1.5.1
Feature
Anthos Config Management now includes the ability to sync from multiple Git repositories. This is a preview feature. To learn more, see Syncing from multiple repositories .
1.5.1
Fixed
The installed product version was being misreported as "anthos-config-management" in ACM 1.5.0. The correct product version is now being reported.
1.5.1
Issue
Note: this issue applies only to ACM in multi-repo mode.
When the enableLegacyFields is set to true, the ACM operator will create a RootSync resource automatically, but any subsequent changes to the RootSync resource will not be noticed by the operator. This will be fixed in a subsequent release. As a workaround, if the RootSync resource resource is modified, add or modify an unused annotation on the ConfigManagement resource to cause the operator to reconcile changes in the RootSync resource.
1.5.1
Change
The nomos status output has been modified significantly to provide a consistent experience for both mono-repo and multi-repo clusters.
1.5.1
Fixed
(Fixed on October 30, 2020) The version of Anthos Configuration Management included in the Anthos On-Prem release 1.5.1-gke.8 had initially referenced a version of the nomos image that had not be moved into the gcr.io/gke-on-prem-release repository, thus preventing a successful installation and/or upgrade of Anthos Configuration Management. This image has since been pushed to the repository to correct the issue for customers not using private registries. Customers using private registries will need to upgrade to 1.5.2 when it is available, or manually copy the nomos:v1.5.1-rc.7 image into their private repository.
September 24, 2020
1.5.0
Feature

1.5.0
Feature
Binary Authorization can now be enabled through the Anthos Config Management Operator. See Setting up with Anthos Config Management for details.
1.5.0
Change
The syncer and importer Containers now both run in the git-importer Pod in the importer Container. Any resource patches that were previously targeted to the syncer container will need to be updated to target the importer container.
1.5.0
Issue
Anthos Config Management installs a resource-group-controller Deployment which fails on non-GKE clusters. This Deployment is unnecessary and does not cause any other issues.
1.5.0
Feature
Anthos Policy Controller has been updated to include a more recent build of OPA Gatekeeper (hash: 15d56e3 ).
1.5.0
Change

July 30, 2020
1.3.3
Fixed
Updated the git-sync image to fix security vulnerability CVE-2019-5482 .
July 23, 2020
1.4.1
Feature
Anthos Config Management now includes Hierarchy Controller as a beta feature. For more information on this component, see the Hierarchy Controller overview .
1.4.1
Feature
Config Connector has been updated in Anthos Config Management to version 1.13.1.
1.4.1
Change
This release improves the handling of GitHub repositories with very large histories.
1.4.1
Change
Prior to this release, Config Sync and kubectl controllers and processes used the same annotation ( kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration ) to calculate three-way merge patches. The shared annotation sometimes resulted in resource fights, causing unnecessary removal of each other's fields. Config Sync now uses its own annotation, which prevents resource clashes.
In most cases, this change will be transparent to you. However, there are two cases where some previously unspecified behavior will change.
The first case is when you have run kubectl apply on an unmanaged resource in a cluster, and you later add that same resource to the GitHub repo. Previously, Config Sync would have pruned any fields that were previously applied but not declared in the GitHub repo. Now, Config Sync writes the declared fields to the resource and leaves undeclared fields in place. If you want to remove those fields, do one of the following:
Get a local copy of the resource from GitHub and kubectl apply it.
Use kubectl edit --save-config to remove the fields directly.
The second case is when you stop managing a resource on the cluster or even stop all of Config Sync on a cluster. In this case, if you want to prune fields from a previously managed resource, you will see different behavior. Previously, you could get a local copy of the resource from GitHub, remove the unwanted fields, and kubectl apply it. Now, kubectl apply no longer prunes the missing fields. If you want to remove those fields, do one of the following:
Call kubectl apply set-last-applied with the unmodified resource from GitHub, then remove unwanted fields and kubectl apply it again without the set-last-applied flag.
Use kubectl edit --save-config to remove the fields directly.
1.4.1
Change
This release includes several logging and performance improvements.
1.4.1
Change
Policy Controller users may now enable --log-denies to log all denies and dryrun failures. This is useful when trying to see what is being denied or fails dry-run and for keeping a log to debug cluster problems without looking through the status of all constraints. This is configured by setting spec.policyController.logDeniesEnabled: true in the configuration file for the Operator. There is an example in the section on Installing Policy Controller .
1.4.1
Change
The use of unsecured HTTP for GitHub repo connections or in an http_proxy is now discouraged, and support for unsecured HTTP will be removed in a future release. HTTPS will continue to be supported for GitHub repo and local proxy connections.
1.4.1
Change
This release includes several fixes and improvements for the nomos command line utility.
1.4.1
Fixed
In error messages, links to error docs are now more concise.
June 25, 2020
1.4.0
Feature
Anthos Config Management is now Generally Available on AKS (Kubernetes v1.16 or higher) and EKS (Kubernetes v1.16 or higher).
1.4.0
Issue
Config Connector is not currently supported on EKS or AKS, as it is unable to run on these providers.
1.4.0
Change
The following Policy Controller constraint templates have been added to the Default Template Library:
allowedserviceportname
destinationruletlsenabled
disallowedauthzprefix
policystrictonly
sourcenotallauthz
The following constraint templates have been updated:

See the Default Template Library documentation for more information.
1.4.0
Change
Anthos Policy Controller has been updated to include a more recent build of OPA Gatekeeper (hash: 25ca799 ).
This new build of OPA Gatekeeper includes a number of bug fixes and performance improvements, and adds three new monitoring metrics:
gatekeeper_sync
gatekeeper_sync_duration_seconds
gatekeeper_sync_last_run_time
1.4.0
Issue
Anthos Config Management is not issuing errors when it encounters certain types of malformed configurations in a resource definition. This may result in the Kubernetes API Server ignoring the malformed fields and applying the default value for the field instead.
1.4.0
Issue
Policy Controller may fail to start successfully when synced resources are marked for deletion.
This issue will be addressed in the upstream OPA Gatekeeper project in a future release. For more information see the relevant issue in the Gatekeeper project.
1.4.0
Fixed
The nomos CLI tool now supports the KUBECONFIG environment variable in a way that matches the kubectl behavior with multiple delimited configuration files.
1.4.0
Fixed
Anthos Config Management no longer gets into a continuous PATCH loop when encountering unmanaged resources with config-management annotations and a missing last-applied-configuration annotation.
1.4.0
Change
This release includes several logging and performance improvements.
June 15, 2020
1.3.2
Issue
A regression in Anthos Config Management 1.3.2 results in unnecessary patches to the API server for the gatekeeper-system namespace and spurious logging for error KNV2005 . This "fight" results when the gatekeeper-system namespace is managed in the Git repo, and two Anthos Config Management components (the operator and syncer) are both trying to reconcile the state of the namespace with the API server. The only workaround at this time is to unmanage the gatekeeper-system namespace. The issue will be fixed in Anthos Config Management 1.4.1.
May 21, 2020
1.3.2
Change
This release includes several performance and memory improvements.
In order to help prevent accidental deletion, Anthos Config Management will no longer allow a user to remove all namespaces or cluster-scoped resources in a single commit. If you wish to delete the full set of resources under management, it now requires two steps: remove all but one in a first commit, allow ACM to sync those changes, then remove the final resource in a second commit.
1.3.2
Change
Anthos Config Management now supports a GKE-only authentication mechanism based on the service account of the cluster's node pool. Documentation on its use is here .
1.3.2
Change
Anthos Config Management will now attempt to detect when resources that it manages are also managed by other controllers. Documentation on this behavior is available in error knv2005 which ACM will log in that case.
1.3.2
Feature
Anthos Config Management now includes Config Connector v1.8.0.
1.3.2
Change
Policy Controller has been upgraded to include a newer version of Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper .
This version includes updates to improve the management of policy resources. As a consequence, finalizers are no longer used to manage Constraints and Constraint Templates.
The following metrics have been made obsolete due to these changes and have been removed:
gatekeeper_watch_manager_is_running
gatekeeper_watch_manager_last_restart_check_time
gatekeeper_watch_manager_last_restart_time
gatekeeper_watch_manager_restart_attempts
The following metrics were removed and will be re-implemented in a later version:
gatekeeper_watch_manager_intended_watch_gvk
gatekeeper_watch_manager_watched_gvk
1.3.2
Change
Error documentation has been updated to add more information on error codes. Errors that are no longer encountered in the product have been removed. Most error references have been embellished with examples and steps for remediation.
April 23, 2020
1.3.1
Feature
Policy Agent now allows configuration of namespaces that will bypass the admission controller. For more information, see Excluding Namespaces from Policy Controller
1.3.1
Change
Anthos Config Management images are now included in the Google-provided system images for Binary Authorization .
1.3.1
Issue

February 21, 2020
1.2.2
Issue
GKE On-prem 1.2.2 includes images for ACM 1.2.1. Upgrading from ACM 1.2.1 to ACM 1.3 is a valid, tested, safe upgrade path.
1.2.2
Fixed
Minor updates and bug fixes.
February 10, 2020
1.2.1
Fixed
Previously, adding an APIService to the repo will leave Anthos Config Management in a bad state, with the error message " KNV2002 : failed to get server resources: unable to retrieve the complete list of server APIs." This issue has been mitigated; Anthos Config Management will now sync APIService objects correctly.
1.2.1
Feature
Anthos Config Management v1.2.1 is generally available for use in production.
1.2.1
Feature
A new CLI subcommand is available. nomos bugreport bundles up Anthos Config Management log information into a Zip file, which can be attached to a Google support ticket.
1.2.1
Feature
Anthos Config Management now can optionally support an unstructured repository, though some features that relied on hierarchical namespaces are disabled in this mode. More information can be found here .
1.2.1
Issue
Currently, Config Connector can only be installed on a single cluster. If multiple Config Connector instances attempt to create or mutate the same Google Cloud resource, conflicts or errors may occur, and you may exhaust quota for a given resource.
1.2.1
Feature
Git repos with submodules are now also supported by Anthos Configuration Management out of the box without additional configuration. This allows delegation of config authoring in a Git-idiomatic way. For more information, please see Git's documentation on submodules .
1.2.1
Issue
It is not currently possible to downgrade to v1.0.x after upgrading to a more recent version of Anthos Config Management.
December 20, 2019

This release has minor bug fixes and performance improvements.
September 19, 2019
1.1.0
Deprecated
The nomos view command is deprecated and is not included in v1.1 or higher of the nomos command.
If you need to continue using nomos view , do not upgrade the nomos command from v1.0. It will remain forward-compatible for the foreseeable future.
1.1.0
Issue
It is not currently possible to downgrade to v1.0.x after upgrading to v1.1.0.
1.1.0
Change
The nomos hydrate command is a replacement for the nomos view command, and reports your Anthos Config Management configuration in a human-readable way.
To use nomos hydrate , upgrade the nomos command to v1.1.
If you need to continue using nomos view , do not upgrade the nomos command from v1.0. It will remain forward-compatible for the foreseeable future.
You can read about a known issue with nomos view .
1.1.0
Issue
Currently, Config Connector can only be installed on a single cluster. If multiple Config Connector instances attempt to create or mutate the same Google Cloud Platform resource, conflicts or errors may occur, and you may exhaust quota for a given resource.
1.1.0
Feature
You can now enable integration with Config Connector (beta), a Kubernetes addon that allows you to manage your Google Cloud Platform resources through Kubernetes configuration. You can sync configs for Google Cloud Platform resources with your Anthos Config Management repo and apply them automatically. For more information, see Installing Config Connector .

Change
Anthos Config Management can now be installed on clusters using PodSecurityPolicies.
1.1.0
Feature
Anthos Config Management v1.1.0 is generally available for use in production.
1.1.0
Change
The apiVersion for the ConfigManagement CustomResource has changed. No action is required; the CustomResource is upgraded automatically when you upgrade to v1.1.0. You can read more about configuring Anthos Config Management .
1.1.0
Change
Managed CRDs (CustomResourceDefinitions) are now Namespace-scoped by default, instead of cluster-scoped. This matches the semantics of the kubectl command.
If a CRD explicitly specifies a scope, Anthos Config Management honors that scope.
1.1.0
Feature
Policy Controller (Beta) is a Kubernetes dynamic admission controller that checks, audits, and enforces your clusters' compliance with policies related to security, regulations, or business rules. It is built using Gatekeeper , an open source project.
1.1.0
Issue
Adding an APIService to the repo will leave Anthos Config Management in a bad state, with the error message KNV2002 : failed to get server resources: unable to retrieve the complete list of server APIs." This issue will affect both new and existing clusters syncing from this repo. To correct the issue:
find the name of the git-importer and syncer pods using kubectl get pods -n config-management-system
copy those names and restart the pods with kubectl delete -n config-management-system pods git-importer-xxxx-xxxx syncer-xxxx-xxxx
These steps are required once for each cluster.
Once the pods for a cluster are restarted, syncing will be back to normal.
1.1.0
Issue
nomos view can fail to parse CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) that exist in the local clone of the repo but have not yet been synced to a cluster.
To work around this issue, use nomos hydrate instead of nomos view .
June 14, 2019
1.0.0
Feature
You can now sync CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs). Anthos Config Management can now sync any type of Kubernetes object. For more information, see Configuring CustomResourceDefinitions .
1.0.0
Change
The following changes have been made to the canonical example repository:
The canonical example repo has moved. If you use this repo or a fork, update your Git repository's remotes or create a separate clone of the new repo to ensure that you receive updates.
The filesystem standard and the value of the Repo object's spec.version for this version of Anthos Config Management are both 1.0.0 .
A new branch named 1.0.0 contains configs compatible with Anthos Config Management v1.0.0.
1.0.0
Change
We improved the instructions for setting up SSH keys for authenticating to a Git repository.
1.0.0
Change

To upgrade to this version, follow the instructions for upgrading .
You must update all nomos binaries when you upgrade to Anthos Config Management v1.0.0.
Versions older than v1.0.0 are no longer available. If you participated in the early-access program for Anthos Config Management, you must upgrade to v1.0.0.
1.0.0
Feature
We document how to stop Anthos Config Management from syncing configs as quickly as possible. This allows you to mitigate the potential for propagating unintended configs to clusters.
1.0.0
Feature
The nomos status subcommand provides a top-level view of the state of Anthos Config Management on all enrolled clusters, including errors and sync status. It reports on all clusters that kubectl can access.
1.0.0
Change
The nomos version command now provides version details for the Config Management Operator on each configured cluster, as well as the version of the nomos command itself.
1.0.0
Change
An example NetworkPolicy illustrates some methods for enforcing good security practices across your clusters.
1.0.0
Breaking
HierarchicalResourceQuotas are no longer supported.

Feature
You can now manage the default Namespace as well as Namespaces with names beginning with kube -.
0.13.1
Change
The git-policy-importer application has been renamed to git-importer .
0.13.1
Change
The nomos-cluster-policy ClusterConfig has been renamed to config-management-cluster-config . After upgrading, both ClusterConfig objects both exist on the cluster. This does not impact the functionality of the cluster, but you may see spurious log messages if the older ClusterConfig is still present. You can remove the old ClusterConfig to avoid these log messages:
kubectl delete clusterconfig nomos-cluster-policy
0.13.1
Fixed
Previously, if a config change removed a controller object (for example, a Deployment that has a ReplicaSet), removing the controller object did not remove objects it controlled. All of a controller object's child objects are now correctly removed when the controller object itself is removed.
0.13.1
Fixed
Previously, if your repo contained only configs for Namespaces and no other configs, the Namespace configs would fail to sync. Repos now sync correctly even if it only contains configs for Namespaces.
0.13.1
Feature
Anthos Config Management v0.13.1 (beta) is a maintenance release, and is compatible with Anthos Config Management v0.13.0.
To upgrade from v0.13.0 on an existing cluster, deploy the new Config Management Operator . You may need to remove an object that is no longer used, to prevent spurious log messages. See the release note about the change below.
0.13.1
Issue
Syncing of CustomResourceDefinitions is not currently supported. If CustomResourceDefinition has been applied to the cluster, you can sync associated CustomResources.
Update: This issue no longer exists in Anthos Config Management v1.0.0 and higher.
March 20, 2019
0.13.0
Change
The nomos-resource-quota object, which combines all of a Namespace's effective ResourceQuotas into a single one that is more efficient for Kubernetes to check and enforce, has been renamed to config-management-resource-quota .
0.13.0
Change
The Nomos object has been renamed to the ConfigManagement object and is now cluster-scoped.
0.13.0
Change
Annotations, rather than labels, are now used to determine that Anthos Config Management is managing a Kubernetes object.
0.13.0
Change
Syncs are no longer required, and are now silently ignored by the Config Management Operator. You can now create a config for any object in your cluster except a CustomResourceDefinition or the Config Management Operator itself.
0.13.0
Change
The nomos.dev/ API group has been renamed to configmanagement.gke.io/ .
0.13.0
Issue
Syncing of CustomResourceDefinitions is not currently supported. If a CustomResourceDefinition has been applied to the cluster, you can sync associated CustomResources.
Update: This issue no longer exists in Anthos Config Management v1.0.0 and higher.
0.13.0
Change
The nomos-system Namespace has been renamed to config-management-system .
0.13.0
Breaking
Anthos Config Management 13.0.0 is the second beta release of Anthos Config Management. It represents a major change from v0.11.6, is not backward-compatible with any prior release, and cannot be installed on a cluster with a previous installation of Anthos Config Management. Backward-incompatible releases will always use a new minor version number.
0.13.0
Change
Prometheus now uses the gkeconfig Namespace.
0.13.0
Feature
You can now share a ResourceQuota among multiple Namespaces with a common abstract namespace directory. See Aggregate ResourceQuotas .

0.11.6
Change
Moved repository format to Filesystem Standard v0.1.0.
0.11.6
Change
Moved installation to use the Config Management Operator.
0.11.6
Issue
In some cases, local changes to managed resources made by kubectl apply can result in the removal of the nomos.dev/managed: enabled label, causing the resource to become unmanaged. As a workaround, use kubectl edit instead, or include the label in the YAML manifest you are applying.
Update: This issue no longer exists in Anthos Config Management v1.0.0 and higher. If changes are manually applied to managed Kubernetes objects, Anthos Config Management effectively reverts those changes as soon as it notices a difference between the config in the repo and the object in the cluster.
For more information, see Managing and unmanaging objects .
0.11.6
Feature
Added support for NamespaceSelectors.
0.11.6
Issue
Syncing of CustomResourceDefinitions is not currently supported. If a CustomResourceDefinition has been applied to the cluster, you can sync associated CustomResources.
Update: This issue no longer exists in Anthos Config Management v1.0.0 and higher.
0.11.6
Feature
Added support for syncing all Kubernetes resources generically. For current limitations, see the list of known issues for this release.
