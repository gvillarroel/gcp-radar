Organize configuration files in a source of truth
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to organize configurations in a
source of truth.
Key Term: A source of truth is the central repository where your Kubernetes
configuration files (manifests) are stored and versioned. Config Sync
supports Git repositories, OCI images, and Helm charts as sources of truth. After
setup, Config Sync monitors your source of truth and applies any changes to
your clusters. For more information about sources, see
Sources of truth .
As your organization grows, you likely need to manage configurations
across a fleet of clusters and support multiple teams working in the same
repositories. A key part of a successful GitOps strategy is ensuring that
configurations are applied to the correct clusters and that teams can work
without interfering with one another.
About configuration files
Config Sync is designed for cluster
operators who manage many clusters. You can ensure that your clusters meet
business and compliance standards by letting Config Sync manage namespaces,
Roles, RoleBindings, ResourceQuotas, and other important Kubernetes objects,
across your fleet.
When Config Sync manages these resources, it keeps your enrolled clusters in
sync using configs . A config is a YAML or JSON file in a source
of truth. Config Sync supports Git repositories, OCI images, and Helm charts
as the source of truth. Configs
contain the same type of configuration details that you can
manually apply to a cluster using the kubectl apply command. You can create a
config for any Kubernetes object that can exist in a cluster. However, some
Kubernetes objects, such as Secrets, contain sensitive information that might be
inappropriate to store in a source of truth. Consider carefully whether to manage these types of objects using Config Sync.
Requirements and limitations
Some Kubernetes resources contain immutable fields, like Pod selectors in a
Deployment object. You can't change any immutable field in a config by
changing the value in the source of truth. Attempting such a change causes a
KNV2009 error. If you need to change an immutable field, delete the object
from your source of truth, wait for Config Sync to delete the object
from the cluster, and then re-create the object in your source of truth with
your updates.
If you use Git submodules ,
you must
grant Config Sync access
to all repositories, including any submodules.
You can't use Config Sync to directly manage built-in Kubernetes
ClusterRoles. GKE comes with some built-in user-facing
roles ,
such as cluster-admin , admin , edit , and view . You can't directly
manage these ClusterRoles with Config Sync, otherwise Config Sync
conflicts with GKE. To add permissions to the built-in
ClusterRoles, use
role aggregation
to modify them indirectly. To modify the roles, create a uniquely named
ClusterRole in your source of truth with the appropriate annotations.
Organize your source of truth
You can configure Config Sync to sync from an entire repository, or from specific
folders or branches. Because of this flexibility, organize your configuration
files based on your team's or organization's needs.
We recommend that when you configure Config Sync, you set the sourceFormat
to unstructured . The structured (hierarchical) source type requires a very specific
folder structure to correctly sync your configs and adds unnecessary complexity
in most cases.
Most of Config Sync's documentation, including this page, uses the unstructured format
by default, but you can find information about the hierarchical format, if needed,
at Use a hierarchical repository .
When using an unstructured source, you have the flexibility to organize your configs to suit your team's workflow. This section provides a few common patterns for structuring your repository.
Environment-based layout
A common approach is to organize your repository by environment.
├── cluster-essentials/
│ ├── crds/
│ └── namespace.yaml
├── environments/
│ ├── dev/
│ │ ├── backend/
│ │ └── frontend/
│ ├── staging/
│ │ ├── backend/
│ │ └── frontend/
│ └── prod/
│ ├── backend/
│ └── frontend/
└── system/
└── monitoring/
In this example, the source of truth is organized as follows:
cluster-essentials/ : contains configuration that applies to all clusters,
regardless of environment. This might include resources like Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and essential namespaces.
environments/ : the parent directory for all environment-specific configurations.
system/ : contains configurations for system-level services like monitoring.
This approach is straightforward to understand and navigate and provides a
clear promotion path for changes from one environment to another.
When you set up Config Sync in this scenario, you create multiple RootSync
objects on each cluster. For example, a development cluster has RootSync
objects syncing from cluster-essentials/ , system/ , and environments/dev/ .
Cluster-based layout
If your focus is on managing a fleet of individual clusters with distinct
configurations, a cluster-based layout might be more suitable.
├── clusters/
│ ├── cluster-a/
│ │ ├── apps/
│ │ └── networking/
│ ├── cluster-b/
│ │ ├── apps/
│ │ └── networking/
│ └── cluster-c/
│ ├── apps/
│ └── networking/
└── shared/
├── roles/
└── policies/
In this example, the source of truth is organized as follows:
clusters/ : contains a directory for each cluster you are managing.
shared/ : holds configurations that are common across all clusters, like RBAC roles and security policies.
This approach is effective for managing many clusters if those
clusters all have unique configurations, as it provides clear ownership
and isolation of configurations. This approach can be more complex to manage
if you have many shared cluster configurations.
When you set up Config Sync in this scenario, you can use a RepoSync to
configure each cluster to sync both from shared and the cluster-specific directory.
Team-based layout
For organizations where different teams manage different applications
or services, a team-based layout can be effective. This approach aligns the
source of truth structure with your organizational structure.
├── teams/
│ ├── team-alpha/
│ │ ├── app-one/
│ │ └── app-two/
│ ├── team-beta/
│ │ ├── service-a/
│ │ └── service-b/
│ └── team-gamma/
│ ├── data-pipeline/
│ └── dashboard/
└── platform/
├── cluster-roles/
└── storage-classes/
In this example, the source of truth is organized in the following way:
teams/ : organizes configuration by team, with each team managing their own application and service configurations.
platform/ : contains cluster-wide configurations that a central
platform team manages and that all teams use.
This approach lets teams manage their own configuration and release cycles and
reduces the chance that one team's changes accidentally impact another team. However,
this approach requires careful management of dependencies between app teams and
platform teams.
When you set up Config Sync, for this scenario, each team
uses a RootSync object to sync configurations, for example team-alpha syncs
from teams/team-alpha/ .
Validating configuration files
After you create, organize, and add configuration files to a source of truth, use the
nomos vet --source-format=unstructured command
to check the syntax and validity of your configs. This helps you avoid errors
during or after a sync.
Ignore object mutations
If you don't want Config Sync to maintain the state of the object in the
cluster after it exists, add the
client.lifecycle.config.k8s.io/mutation: ignore annotation to the object that
you want Config Sync to ignore mutations in.
The following example shows you how to add the annotation to an object:
metadata :
annotations :
client.lifecycle.config.k8s.io/mutation : ignore
You cannot manually modify this annotation on managed objects in the cluster.
Convert a hierarchical repository to an unstructured repository
If you use a hierarchical repository
and want to convert it to an unstructured repository ,
run the following command:
nomos hydrate PATH
Replace PATH with the path to your directory.
This command creates a compiled/ directory in the current working directory. Within
that directory, a subdirectory is created for each enrolled cluster. These
subdirectories contain the fully resolved configs and can be used in an unstructured
repository.
For more details, see nomos commands .
If you prefer converting your repository manually, complete the following
instructions:
Remove Repo configs in the system/ directory from your Git repository.
The Repo resource is not needed for an unstructured repository.
The abstract namespace directory
isn't supported in an unstructured repository. Therefore, declare the
namespace of all resources originally included in the namespaces/ directory and
its subdirectories.
Namespace inheritance
isn't supported in the unstructured repository. Therefore, declare all
resources that are originally inherited in descendant namespaces (the ones originally under the namespaces/ directory).
