Using Config Sync in multiple environments with automated rendering
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial shows you how to set up Config Sync for
Google Kubernetes Engine across two environments, one for development and one
for production, using best practices for Config Sync.
In this scenario, you're part of a platform admin team at Foo Corp. The Foo Corp
applications are deployed to GKE, with resources divided across
two projects, dev and prod . The dev project contains a development
GKE cluster, and the prod project contains the production
GKE cluster. Your goal as the platform admin is to ensure that
both environments stay within compliance of Foo Corp's policies, and that base
level resources, like Kubernetes namespaces and service accounts, remain
consistent across both environments.
The following diagram shows you an overview of the environments that you set
up in this tutorial:
This tutorial leverages the automated rendering feature in Config Sync
to render the resources on the cluster. Each of the clusters is configured
to sync from a directory that contains a Kustomization config file, which
triggers the rendering process automatically in Config Sync. For more
details, see
Use a repo with Kustomize configurations and Helm charts .
As shown in the preceding diagram, in this tutorial you create the following
resources:
Two Google Cloud projects representing the development and production
environments.
Two GKE clusters, dev and prod , in the separate projects,
with Config Sync installed.
Repository architecture
In this tutorial, you configure Config Sync to sync to the configs in the
config-source/ directory
of the samples repository. This directory contains
the following directories and files:
config-source/
├── base
│ ├── foo
│ │ ├── kustomization.yaml
│ │ ├── namespace.yaml
│ │ └── serviceaccount.yaml
│ ├── kustomization.yaml
│ ├── pod-creator-clusterrole.yaml
│ └── pod-creator-rolebinding.yaml
├── cloudbuild.yaml
├── overlays
│ ├── dev
│ │ └── kustomization.yaml
│ └── prod
│ └── kustomization.yaml
└── README.md
The config-source directory includes the base/ manifests and the dev/ and
prod/ Kustomize overlays. Each directory contains a kustomization.yaml file,
which lists the files Kustomize should manage and apply to the cluster.
In dev/kustomization.yaml and prod/kustomization.yaml a series of patches
are defined. These patches manipulate the base/ resources for that specific
environment.
For example, the dev RoleBinding allows all Foo Corp developers deploy Pods to
the dev cluster, whereas the prod RoleBinding only allows a Continuous
Deployment agent, deploy-bot@foo-corp.com , to deploy Pods into production:
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- ../../base
patches:
# ServiceAccount - make name unique per environ
- target:
kind: ServiceAccount
name: foo-ksa
patch: |-
- op: replace
path: /metadata/name
value: foo-ksa-dev
- op: replace
path: /metadata/namespace
value: foo-dev
# Pod creators - give all Foo Corp developers access
- target:
kind: RoleBinding
name: pod-creators
patch: |-
- op: replace
path: /subjects/0/name
value: developers-all@foo-corp.com
commonLabels:
environment: dev
Objectives
Set up Config Sync to automatically render and sync the configuration for
the two separate environments.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Google Kubernetes Engine
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
Before you begin this tutorial, make sure that you have completed the
following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, choose or create
two Google Cloud projects.
Note: If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this
procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After
you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources
associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Upgrade your Google Cloud CLI to the latest version.
Install or upgrade the nomos command
Create and register your clusters
To let you focus on the workflow that you need to use when you configure
Config Sync for multiple environments, the
multi-environments-kustomize
directory contains scripts that you can use to automate the configuration of
Config Sync.
Clone the sample repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-config-management-samples.git
Navigate to the folder that contains the resources that you need for this
tutorial:
cd anthos-config-management-samples/multi-environments-kustomize/
To run the scripts used in this tutorial, set the following variables:
export DEV_PROJECT = " DEV_PROJECT_ID "
export PROD_PROJECT = " PROD_PROJECT_ID "
export DEV_CLUSTER_ZONE = " DEV_CLUSTER_ZONE "
export PROD_CLUSTER_ZONE = " PROD_CLUSTER_ZONE "
export CM_CONFIG_DIR = "config-sync-rendering"
Replace the following:
DEV_PROJECT_ID : the project ID from the
Google Cloud project that you want you use as your dev project
PROD_PROJECT_ID : the project ID from the
Google Cloud project that you want you use as your prod project
DEV_CLUSTER_ZONE : the Compute Engine zone
that you want to create your dev cluster in. For example, us-central1-c .
PROD_CLUSTER_ZONE : the Compute Engine zone
that you want to create your prod cluster in
To create two clusters, run the ./create-clusters.sh script:
./create-clusters.sh
This script creates one GKE cluster named dev in the dev
project and one GKE cluster named prod in the prod project.
This script also enables the GKE API and
connects to your dev and prod clusters so that you can access their APIs
with kubectl .
Example output:
kubeconfig entry generated for dev.
Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for prod.
⭐️ Done creating clusters.
To register your clusters to two separate fleets, run
the register-clusters.sh script:
./register-clusters.sh
This script creates a Google Cloud service account and key for
GKE cluster registration, then uses the
gcloud container fleet memberships register command to register the dev
and prod clusters to GKE in their own projects.
Example output:
Waiting for Feature Config Management to be created...done.
⭐️ Done registering clusters.
Setting up Config Sync
Now that you have created and registered your clusters, you can install
Config Sync and verify the installation.
Install Config Sync
To install Config Sync, on the dev and prod cluster, run the
install-config-sync.sh script:
./install-config-sync.sh
Expected output:
🔁 Installing ConfigSync on the dev cluster...
Updated property [ core/project ] .
Switched to context "DEV_CLUSTER" .
Waiting for Feature Config Management to be updated...done.
🔁 Installing ConfigSync on the prod cluster...
Updated property [ core/project ] .
Switched to context "PROD_CLUSTER" .
Waiting for Feature Config Management to be updated...done.
Config Sync is now syncing to the configs in your repositories.
Verify your configuration
In this section you check to make sure that your clusters are syncing to the
configs in your repository:
To check the state of your Config Sync installation, run the
nomos status command :
nomos status
You should see that both your dev and prod clusters are now synced to their
respective repos:
gke_DEV_PROJECT_ID_us-central1-c_dev
--------------------
<root> https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-config-management-samples/multi-environments-kustomize/config-source/overlays/dev@main

namespace/default Current
namespace/foo Current
default rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pod-creators Current
foo serviceaccount/foo-ksa-prod Current
```
Use kubectl to switch to the dev cluster:
kubectl config use-context "gke_ ${ DEV_PROJECT } _ ${ DEV_CLUSTER_ZONE } _dev"
To verify that the resources are synced, get namespaces. You should see
the foo namespace appear.
kubectl get namespace
Example output:
NAME STATUS AGE
config-management-monitoring Active 9m38s
config-management-system Active 9m38s
default Active 47h
foo Active 9m5s
kube-node-lease Active 47h
kube-public Active 47h
kube-system Active 47h
resource-group-system Active 9m30s
You have now set up automated config rendering for a dev and prod environment,
across multiple Google Cloud projects and environments.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete all resources
To delete the resources that you created in this tutorial, but to keep both the
dev and prod projects intact, run the cleanup script:
./cleanup.sh
Delete the projects
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
