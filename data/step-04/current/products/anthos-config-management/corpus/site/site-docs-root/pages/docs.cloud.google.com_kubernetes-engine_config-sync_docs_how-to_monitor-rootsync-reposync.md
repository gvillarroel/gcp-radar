Monitor RootSync and RepoSync objects
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you different ways that you can monitor your
RootSync and RepoSync objects .
For example, you might want to verify if your latest commit in a source of truth
is applied to a cluster and reconciled successfully.
View synced commits
You can check which commit is synced to the cluster by checking the
.status.sync field in the RootSync or RepoSync object.
To view synced commits for a RootSync object, run the following command:
kubectl get rootsync ROOT_SYNC_NAME -n config-management-system
Replace ROOT_SYNC_NAME with the name of the
RootSync object.
To view synced commits for a RepoSync object, run the following command:
kubectl get reposync REPO_SYNC_NAME -n REPO_SYNC_NAMESPACE
Replace the following:
REPO_SYNC_NAME : the name of the RepoSync object.
REPO_SYNC_NAMESPACE : the namespace that you created your
namespace repository in.
The output for these commands show you the value of the source commit and the
synced commit. For example, if you ran the command for the RepoSync, you would
see output similar to the following:
NAME RENDERINGCOMMIT SOURCECOMMIT SYNCCOMMIT
root-sync 66882815f0ef5517df27e864fb1315e97756ab72 66882815f0ef5517df27e864fb1315e97756ab72 66882815f0ef5517df27e864fb1315e97756ab72
The value in the RENDERINGCOMMIT column is the commit that is processed by
the hydration-controller . If no rendering is needed, the value is the same as
the SOURCECOMMIT column. The value in the SOURCECOMMIT column is the commit
from the source of truth that should be synced to the cluster. The value in the
SYNCCOMMIT column is the commit that is deployed to the cluster. If
the two values in the SOURCECOMMIT and SYNCCOMMIT columns are the same, the
expected commit has been deployed to the cluster.
Confirm resources in the commit are reconciled
Because ResourceGroups capture the reconciliation status of the managed
resources declared in the source of truth, you can examine them to confirm if
resources in the commit are reconciled.
The ResourceGroup object has the same namespace and name
as the RootSync or RepoSync object. For example, for the RootSync object with
the name root-sync in the namespace config-management-system , the
corresponding ResourceGroup object is also root-sync in the namespace
config-management-system .
To get the ResourceGroup object for a RootSync object:
kubectl get resourcegroup ROOT_SYNC_NAME -n config-management-system -o yaml
To get the ResourceGroup object for a RepoSync object:
kubectl get resourcegroup REPO_SYNC_NAME -n REPO_SYNC_NAMESPACE -o yaml
Replace the following:
ROOT_SYNC_NAME : the name of the ResourceGroup object
that you want to look up.
REPO_SYNC_NAME : the name of the ResourceGroup object
that you want to look up.
REPO_SYNC_NAMESPACE : the name of the ResourceGroup
object that you want to look up.
To confirm that the resources in the commit are reconciled, look for the
following in the output:
The .status.observedGeneration equals the value of the field
.metadata.generation in the ResourceGroup object.
The Stalled condition has a status of "False" .
Each item under .status.resourceStatuses has an an actuation of
Succeeded , a reconcile of Succeeded , and a status of Current .
Note: The Reconciling condition on the ResourceGroup object is deprecated and
can be ignored.
View errors
RootSync and RepoSync objects use the status field to track errors encountered
when syncing the configs from the source of truth to a cluster.
To view the status of a RootSync object, run the following command:
kubectl get rootsync ROOT_SYNC_NAME -n config-management-system -o yaml
Replace the ROOT_SYNC_NAME with the name of the
RootSync object.
To view the status of a RepoSync object, run the following command:
kubectl get reposync REPO_SYNC_NAME -n NAMESPACE -o yaml
Replace the following:
REPO_SYNC_NAME : the name of the RepoSync object.
NAMESPACE : the namespace that you created your
namespace repository in.
To learn more about the subfields under the status field, see
Status of the objects .
View object details
To view details of the RootSync and RepoSync objects and to discover further
information about potential errors, use the kubectl describe command.
The output of this command includes events, which can be particularly helpful
for debugging issues such as containers facing memory constraints (OOMKilled),
scheduling failures, or image pull errors.
For a more readable format, convert the output to YAML by appending -o yaml to
the following commands. This format is especially helpful when you need to
examine specific parameters, annotations, or resource specifications.
To view details for a RootSync object, run the following command:
kubectl describe rootsync ROOT_SYNC_NAME -n config-management-system
Replace the ROOT_SYNC_NAME with the name of the
RootSync object.
To view details for a RepoSync object, run the following command:
kubectl describe reposync REPO_SYNC_NAME -n NAMESPACE
Replace the following:
REPO_SYNC_NAME : the name of the RepoSync object.
NAMESPACE : the namespace that you created your
namespace repository in.
View if a resource is ready
To learn if the resources synced to the cluster are ready, view the
reconciliation status. For example, viewing the reconciliation status can show
you if a synced Deployment is ready to serve traffic.
For a source of truth synced to the cluster, the reconciliation statuses of all
resources are aggregated in a resource called ResourceGroup. For each RootSync or
RepoSync object, a ResourceGroup is generated to capture the set of
resources applied to the cluster and aggregate their statuses.
To view the reconciliation status for the RootSync object, run the following
command:
kubectl get resourcegroup.kpt.dev ROOT_SYNC_NAME -n config-management-system -o yaml
Replace the ROOT_SYNC_NAME with the name of the
RootSync object.
To view the reconciliation status for the RepoSync object, run the following
command:
kubectl get resourcegroup.kpt.dev REPO_SYNC_NAME -n NAMESPACE -o yaml
Replace the following:
REPO_SYNC_NAME : the name of the RepoSync object.
NAMESPACE : the namespace that you created your
namespace repository in.
In the output, you see all of the ResourceGroup resource statuses. For
example, the following output shows that a Deployment named nginx-deployment
is ready:
resourceStatuses:
- group: apps
kind: Deployment
name: nginx-deployment
namespace: default
status: Current
View logs
For each RootSync and RepoSync object you create, Config Sync creates a
reconciler Deployment to perform syncing. This section explains how to view the
logs for these reconcilers. Viewing the logs can help when debugging an issue by
providing additional information about progress, warnings, and errors beyond
what is available in the RootSync and RepoSync object status.
To view the logs for the RootSync or RepoSync reconciler, run the following
command:
kubectl logs -n config-management-system deployment/ RECONCILER_NAME CONTAINER_NAME
Replace the following:
RECONCILER_NAME : the reconciler name of the
RootSync or RepoSync object.
For RootSync , the reconciler name is
root-reconciler- ROOT_SYNC_NAME or
root-reconciler if the name of RootSync is root-sync .
For RepoSync , the reconciler name is
ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE - REPO_SYNC_NAME - REPO_SYNC_NAME_LENGTH
or ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE if the name of
RepoSync is repo-sync , where NAMESPACE is
the namespace you created your RepoSync object in.
CONTAINER_NAME : the container name must be one
of the following values: reconciler , git-sync ,
hydration-controller , oci-sync , or helm-sync . To learn more about
these containers, see
Reconciler containers .
Configure RootSync or RepoSync reconciler log level
To include more information in the container logs, configure the log
verbosity. By default, most containers have a default value of 0 for log
verbosity. The exceptions to this are the git-sync and otel-agent
containers that have a default value of 5 .
When changing log verbosity, keep in mind that increasing log verbosity results
in higher logging costs because there's a greater volume of data recorded.
To change log verbosity, use the .spec.override.logLevels field as shown in
the following example:
apiVersion : configsync.gke.io/v1beta1
kind : RootSync
metadata :
name : root-sync
namespace : config-management-system
spec :
override :
logLevels :
- containerName : "reconciler"
logLevel : 0
- containerName : "git-sync"
logLevel : 10
The value in the containerName field must be one of the following:
reconciler , git-sync , hydration-controller , oci-sync , or helm-sync .
To confirm log verbosity is configured, run the following command:
kubectl get deployment.apps/root-reconciler -n config-management-system -o yaml
The log verbosity can be found as one of the args within
spec.template.spec.containers[] and looks like -v=0 , where 0 is the current
log verbosity. In this example, a log verbosity value of 0 would log only
critical events.
