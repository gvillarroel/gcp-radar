Sync objects to multiple namespaces
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to use Config Sync to manage namespaces and
choose which objects Config Sync syncs to your namespaces.
Kubernetes resource objects can either be cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped,
depending on the resource type. You select the cluster by configuring your client
to talk to a specific cluster. You select the namespace by configuring the
metadata.namespace field in the object manifest. Config Sync adds additional
capabilities: cluster selectors and namespace selectors, which let you further refine
which objects are synced.
Before reading this page, you should already be familiar with the following
Kubernetes concepts:
Namespaces
Labels and selectors
About scoping objects with Config Sync
By default, when you install Config Sync
on a cluster or as a fleet default, Config Sync
syncs all of the Kubernetes objects in your source of truth to clusters with
Config Sync installed or all clusters in a fleet. But,
by scoping objects to a cluster or namespace, you can control
which objects are synced to a cluster or namespace.
Config Sync offers
the following methods to scope your objects:
Configure cluster-scoped objects with a cluster selector
Configure cluster-scoped objects with fleet package labels
( Preview )
Configure namespace-scoped objects with a namespace selector
(this page)
Use explicit namespaces
We recommend that you use explicit namespace declaration when configuring Config Sync
because it lets you manage namespace metadata and delete namespaces later, if needed.
The default setting is implicit , but you can change the namespace strategy in your
RootSync or RepoSync object by setting the namespaceStrategy field to
explicit . For more information, see
namespace strategy .
About namespace selectors
Namespace selectors are a feature of Config Sync that let you deploy
otherwise identical resource objects into multiple namespaces.
Using namespace selectors is similar to using
Kubernetes label selectors
to map a Service to a set of Pods, but with an extra layer of indirection.
Because you can't add custom fields to existing resource types, you instead define
your selector in a NamespaceSelector object. Then, you reference that selector
by name in an annotation on the objects that you want to use that selector.
To use namespace selectors:
Add or choose an existing label on the namespaces to which you want to deploy.
Define a NamespaceSelector resource object in your source of truth.
Config Sync does not sync NamespaceSelector objects to your cluster.
For each object that you want to sync to one or more namespaces, modify the object's
configuration to remove the metadata.namespace field and add the
configmanagement.gke.io/namespace-selector annotation with a value that
matches the metadata.name of your NamespaceSelector .
The examples in the subsequent section provide more details on how to define
NamespaceSelector objects and annotate other objects to use the NamespaceSelector .
Before you begin
Install Config Sync .
Create, or have access to, a source of truth where you store your configuration files.
If you don't already have one or more namespaces,
create the namespaces that you want to scope your resources to .
You can create the namespace directly in your cluster or in your
source of truth.
Use namespace selectors
Namespace selectors are defined either with
equality-based requirements or
set-based requirements . You can combine
multiple requirements.
Equality-based label selector example
The following example shows how to use equality-based selectors to select which namespaces
a configuration applies to:
Add a label to one or more namespaces:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE app = gamestore
Replace NAMESPACE with the name of your namespace.
Run this command for each namespace that you want to label.
Create a namespace selector called gamestore-selector .
kind : NamespaceSelector
apiVersion : configmanagement.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : gamestore-selector
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
app : gamestore
If another object's configuration references this namespace selector, that configuration can only be
applied to objects in namespaces that have the app: gamestore label.
A namespace selector has no effect until you reference it in another configuration.
Create an example object quota that references the namespace selector:
kind : ResourceQuota
apiVersion : v1
metadata :
name : quota
annotations :
configmanagement.gke.io/namespace-selector : gamestore-selector
spec :
hard :
pods : "1"
cpu : "200m"
memory : "200Mi"
The resource quota is created only in namespaces that have the app: gamestore label.
Set-based label selector example
The following example shows how to use set-based selectors to exempt namespaces
from inheriting objects:
Add a label to one or more namespaces:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE quota-exempt = exempt
Replace NAMESPACE with the name of your namespace.
Run this command for each namespace that you want to label.
Create a namespace selector called exclude-exempt-namespaces :
kind : NamespaceSelector
apiVersion : configmanagement.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : excludes-exempt-namespaces
spec :
selector :
matchExpressions :
- key : quota-exempt
operator : NotIn
values :
- exempt
If another object's configuration references this namespace selector, that
configuration is applied to all namespaces except those with the
quota-exempt: exempt key-value pair.
A namespace selector has no effect until you reference it in another configuration.
Create an example object quota that references the namespace selector:
kind : ResourceQuota
apiVersion : v1
metadata :
name : quota
annotations :
configmanagement.gke.io/namespace-selector : exclude-exempt-namespaces
spec :
hard :
pods : "1"
cpu : "200m"
memory : "200Mi"
The resource quota is created in all namespaces except those that have
the quota-exempt: exempt key-value pair.
Integration with team scopes and fleet namespaces
Fleet namespaces created in Google Cloud automatically have the
fleet.gke.io/fleet-scope: your-scope label. All namespaces also have the Kubernetes
kubernetes.io/metadata.name: your-namespace label. You can use these default
labels to set up a namespace selector for selecting fleet namespaces.
The fleet tenancy tutorial
explains in more detail how to use namespace selectors
with fleets and team scopes to selectively manage objects for different teams.
Namespace-scoped objects with hierarchical mode
Although unstructured repositories are recommended for most use cases,
you can use namespace selectors
to scope your objects with a hierarchical repository. The use of namespace
selectors is the same, but there are additional limitations and requirements
for how you organize your namespace configuration in your source of truth.
Limitations
When you use a namespace selector configuration with a hierarchical repository,
be aware of the following limitations and requirements:
You must store all configuration files for namespaces and namespace-scoped objects within the
namespaces/ directory of the
hierarchical repository and its
descendant directories.
You must explicitly specify a namespace configuration in
the namespaces/NAMESPACE subdirectory, where NAMESPACE
matches the name of the namespace. All other namespace-scoped objects must
be stored in the same subdirectory. If a namespace configuration is missing,
Config Sync returns a KNV1044 error.
Resources that reference a namespace selector
are applied to namespaces that inherit a given configuration from an
abstract namespace, regardless of the directory structure of the namespaces/
directory.
Namespace selector location
In a hierarchical repository, you can place a
namespace selector configuration in any abstract namespace directory, but not in a
namespace directory.
The following example repository architecture shows valid and invalid
locations for namespace selectors:
namespace-inheritance
...
├── namespaces
│ ├── eng
│ │ ├── gamestore
│ │ │ ├── namespace.yaml
│ │ │ └── ns_selector.yaml # invalid
│ │ └── ns_selector.yaml # valid
│ ├── ns_selector.yaml # valid
│ ├── rnd
│ │ ├── incubator-1
│ │ │ ├── namespace.yaml
│ │ │ └── ns_selector.yaml # invalid
│ │ └── ns_selector.yaml # valid
Because the namespaces , eng , and rnd directories represent abstract
namespaces, you can put a selector in them. However, because the gamestore and
incubator-1 directories represent actual namespaces, you can't put a
namespace selector in them.
Configure an abstract namespace
With a hierarchical repository, you can optionally use abstract namespaces.
The following example shows how to move your namespace directory into an abstract namespace
that contains additional configurations inherited by the namespace:
In your repository, create an abstract namespace directory. The abstract
namespace directory doesn't contain any configurations for namespaces,
but the descendant namespace directories do contain configurations.
In the abstract namespace directory that you created, create a configuration for a Role
that grants get and list permissions on all objects in any
namespace that eventually inherits the Role:
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : Role
metadata :
name : ROLE_NAME
rules :
- apiGroups : [ "" ]
resources : [ "*" ]
verbs : [ "get" , "list" ]
Replace ROLE_NAME with the name of the role.
Create a configuration for a role binding that binds the
role to an email group:
kind : RoleBinding
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata :
name : ROLE_NAME
subjects :
- kind : Group
name : group@example.com
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef :
kind : Role
name : ROLEBINDING_NAME
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
Replace ROLEBINDING_NAME with the name of the Role.
Move the namespace configuration that you
created in the previous section from the namespaces/ directory to the
abstract namespace directory that you created in this section.
Disable inheritance for objects
You can selectively disable inheritance for any configuration by setting the
hierarchyMode field to none . HierarchyConfigs are stored in the system/
directory of the repository. This example disables inheritance for role bindings:
# system/hierarchy-config.yaml
kind : HierarchyConfig
apiVersion : configmanagement.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : rbac
spec :
resources :
# Configure role to only be allowed in leaf namespaces.
- group : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
kinds : [ "RoleBinding" ]
hierarchyMode : none
