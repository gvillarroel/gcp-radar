Declare dependencies between resource objects
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide teaches you how dependencies work in Config Sync
and how to specify your own dependencies.
Config Sync automatically detects implicit dependencies
between specific objects when syncing them to the cluster.
For example, the Namespace objects are always applied before any
objects in those Namespaces, and a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) object is always applied before
any custom resource of this type is applied. Likewise, deletion ordering is
reverse for these implicit dependencies: Namespaces are deleted after objects
in that namespace, and CRDs are deleted after Custom Resources of that type.
You can also set explicit dependencies by using the depends-on annotation.
For example, you might want your MySQL StatefulSet to start up before your
Wordpress Deployment, so that your database is applied and ready before
Wordpress starts.
Requirements
RootSync and RepoSync APIs need to be enabled.
If you installed Config Sync manually using kubectl, and don't have
RootSync and RepoSync APIs enabled, you need to
migrate your ConfigManagement object .
Limitation: Dependencies must be in the same source of truth as
their dependent. Dependencies must be managed by the same RootSync or RepoSync
object as their dependents, which ensures all resources are in the same
ResourceGroup.
Apply group
When syncing resources to the cluster, Config Sync divides resources that have direct or indirect dependencies into different apply groups. One apply group only consists of resources without direct or indirect dependencies on each others. The apply group in which resources do not have any dependencies will be applied first.
Actuation and reconciliation
When an object is actuated (either applied or pruned), it
can take a while for the object
to be reconciled by its controller. For example, when a Deployment is applied,
the underlying Pods might not be ready immediately. After the underlying Pods
are ready, the Deployment is reconciled. For different types of objects,
Config Sync checks different types of conditions to verify
if an object is reconciled. More details can be found in
sigs.k8s.io/cli-utils
With the depends-on annotation, Config Sync not only applies objects in the
order that you want, it also verifies
that the dependency object is reconciled before applying the dependent object.
If the dependecy object does not reconcile within the default reconcile timeout of 5 minutes, Config Sync will not apply the dependent object until next sync period. You can override the default reconcile timeout by setting spec.override.reconcileTimeout .
Add the depends-on annotation to an object
To specify a dependency, add the config.kubernetes.io/depends-on annotation
on the dependent object with a value that references the
dependency objects.
For the Wordpress example, the annotation in Wordpress Deployment
resembles the following:
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : wordpress
namespace : default
labels :
app : wordpress
annotations :
config.kubernetes.io/depends-on : apps/namespaces/default/StatefulSet/wordpress-mysql
When Config Sync applies the objects, it first applies the dependency, the
object wordpress-mysql StatefulSet. When the dependency has been reconciled,
Config Sync applies the dependent, the
wordpress Deployment.
Object references
Object references use the following syntax:
For namespaced objects:
GROUP /namespaces/ NAMESPACE / KIND / NAME
For cluster-scoped objects:
GROUP / KIND / NAME
Replace the following:
GROUP : The group of the dependency object.
NAMESPACE : The namespace of the namespace-scoped
dependency object.
KIND : The kind of the dependency object. This field
is case sensitive. For example, use "Pod" instead of "pod".
NAME : The name of the dependency object.
For objects in the core group,
the empty string is used instead, for example /namespaces/test/Pod/pod-a .
Use , to separate multiple object references, for example
/namespaces/test/Pod/pod-a,/namespaces/test/Pod/pod-b .
