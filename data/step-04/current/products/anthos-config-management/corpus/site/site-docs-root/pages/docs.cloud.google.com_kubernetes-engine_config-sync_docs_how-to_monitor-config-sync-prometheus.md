Monitor Config Sync with Prometheus
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The page describes how to send metrics from Config Sync to
Prometheus.
This page explains how to use Prometheus to view Config Sync metrics. We
recommend that you use either Prometheus (this page) or
Cloud Monitoring
to export metrics. It's also possible to use
custom metrics .
Config Sync automatically collects and exports metrics to
Prometheus . You can configure
Cloud Monitoring to pull custom
metrics from Prometheus. Then you can see custom metrics in both Prometheus and
Monitoring. For more information, see
Using Prometheus in the GKE
documentation.
Scrape the metrics
All Prometheus metrics are available for scraping at port 8675. Before you can
scrape metrics, you need to configure your cluster for Prometheus in one of two
ways. Either:
Follow the
Prometheus documentation
to configure your cluster for scraping, or
Use the
Prometheus Operator
along with the following manifests, which scrape all Config Sync
metrics every 10 seconds.
Note: You need
kubectl v1.14
and the curl command to follow this procedure. If your cluster runs 1.14 or
higher, you can use the kubectl command provided by the
Google Cloud CLI .
Create a temporary directory to hold the manifest files.
mkdir config-sync-monitor
cd config-sync-monitor
Download the Prometheus Operator manifest from the
CoreOS repository .
repository, using the curl command:
curl -o bundle.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/master/bundle.yaml
This manifest is configured to use the default namespace, which is not
recommended. The next step modifies the configuration to use a namespace
called monitoring instead. To use a different namespace, substitute it
where you see monitoring in the remaining steps.
Create a file to update the namespace of the ClusterRoleBinding in the
bundle above.
# patch-crb.yaml
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ClusterRoleBinding
metadata :
name : prometheus-operator
subjects :
- kind : ServiceAccount
name : prometheus-operator
namespace : monitoring # we are patching from default namespace
Create a kustomization.yaml file that applies the patch and modifies the
namespace for other resources in the manifest.
# kustomization.yaml
resources :
- bundle.yaml
namespace : monitoring
patchesStrategicMerge :
- patch-crb.yaml
Create the monitoring namespace if one does not exist. You can use a
different name for the namespace, but if you do, also change the value
of namespace in the YAML manifests from the previous steps.
kubectl create namespace monitoring
Apply the Kustomize manifest using the following commands:
kubectl apply -k .
until kubectl get customresourcedefinitions servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com ; \
do date; sleep 1; echo ""; done
The second command blocks until the CRDs are available on the cluster.
Create the manifest for the resources necessary to configure a Prometheus
server which scrapes metrics from Config Sync.

Apply the manifest using the following commands:
kubectl apply -f config-sync.yaml
until kubectl rollout status statefulset/prometheus-config-sync -n monitoring; \
do sleep 1; done
The second command blocks until the Pods are running.
You can verify the installation by forwarding the web port of the
Prometheus server to your local machine.
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-config-sync 9190
You can now access the Prometheus web UI at http://localhost:9190 .
Remove the temporary directory.
cd ..
rm -rf config-sync-monitor
Available Prometheus metrics
Config Sync collects the following metrics and makes them available
to Prometheus. The Labels column lists all
labels
that are applicable to each metric. Metrics without labels represent a single
measurement over time while metrics with labels represent multiple measurements,
one for each combination of label values.
If this table becomes out of sync, you can filter metrics by prefix in the
Prometheus user interface. All of the metrics start with the prefix
config_sync_ .

Example debugging procedures for Prometheus
The following examples illustrate some patterns for using Prometheus metrics,
object status fields, and object annotations to detect and diagnose problems
related to Config Sync. These examples show how you can start with
high level monitoring that detects a problem and then progressively refine your
search to drill down and diagnose the root cause of the problem.
Query configs by status
The reconciler process provides high-level metrics that give useful insight into
an overall view of how Config Sync is operating on the cluster. You
can see if any errors have occurred, and can even
set up alerts for them .
config_sync_reconciler_errors
Query metrics by reconciler
If you are using Config Sync RootSync and RepoSync APIs,
then you can monitor the RootSync and RepoSync objects. The RootSync and RepoSync
objects are instrumented with high-level metrics that give you useful insight
into how Config Sync is operating on the cluster. Almost all metrics are
tagged by the reconciler name, so you can see if any errors have occurred and
can set up alerts for them in
Prometheus .
See the full list of available metric labels for filtering.
In Prometheus, you can use the following filters for the RootSyncs or RepoSyncs:
# Querying RootSync
config_sync_reconciler_errors{configsync_sync_name= ROOT_SYNC_NAME }
# Querying RepoSync
config_sync_reconciler_errors{configsync_sync_name= REPO_SYNC_NAME }
Query import and sync operations by status
In Prometheus, you could use the following queries:
# Check for errors that occurred when sourcing configs.
config_sync_reconciler_errors{component="source"}
# Check for errors that occurred when syncing configs to the cluster.
config_sync_reconciler_errors{component="sync"}
You can also check the metrics for the source and sync processes themselves:
config_sync_parser_duration_seconds{status="error"}
config_sync_apply_duration_seconds{status="error"}
config_sync_remediate_duration_seconds{status="error"}
Monitor resources with Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus is Google Cloud's fully
managed multi-cloud solution for
Prometheus metrics. It supports two modes
for data collection:
managed collection
(the recommended mode) or
self-deployed data collection .
Complete the following steps to set up monitoring Config Sync with Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus
in the managed collection mode.
Enable Managed Prometheus on your cluster by following the instructions on
Set up managed collection .
Save the following sample manifest as
pod-monitoring-config-sync-monitoring.yaml . This manifest configures a
PodMonitoring
resource to scrape the Config Sync metrics on port 8675 of the
otel-collector-* Pod under the config-management-monitoring namespace.
The PodMonitoring resource uses a Kubernetes label selector to find
the otel-collector-* Pod.
apiVersion : monitoring.googleapis.com/v1
kind : PodMonitoring
metadata :
name : config-sync-monitoring
namespace : config-management-monitoring
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
app : opentelemetry
component : otel-collector
endpoints :
- port : 8675
interval : 10s
Apply the manifest to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f pod-monitoring-config-sync-monitoring.yaml
Verify that your Prometheus data is being exported using the Cloud Monitoring
Metrics Explorer page in the Google Cloud console following the instructions on
Managed Service for Prometheus data in
Cloud Monitoring .
Note: When querying Prometheus metrics from Cloud Monitoring, the Histogram
metrics with suffix _count or _sum in the available metrics
won't appear.
