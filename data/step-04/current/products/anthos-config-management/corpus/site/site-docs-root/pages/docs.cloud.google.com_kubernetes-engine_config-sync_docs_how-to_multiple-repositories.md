Configure syncing from more than one source of truth
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to configure more than one root and namespace-scoped
source of truth by creating
RootSync and RepoSync objects.
Having a root source of truth lets you sync
cluster-scoped and
namespace-scoped configs.
A root source of truth can use admin-level credentials to
enforce policies on application namespaces and override local changes that drift
from the state that you declared in your configs. A central administrator
typically governs the root sources of truth.
Namespace-scoped sources of truth are optional and can contain namespace-scoped configs
synced to a particular namespace across clusters. You can delegate the setup and
control of a namespace-scoped source of truth to non-administrative users. Although
Config Sync automatically detects changes from the source of truth, you can
add an extra layer of drift detection by adding an admission webhook to a
namespace-scoped source of truth. For details on how to do this, see
Prevent config drift .
Before you begin
Create, or make sure you have access to, an
unstructured source of truth that
can contain the configs that Config Sync syncs to. Config Sync supports
Git repositories, Helm charts, and OCI images as the source of truth.
Namespace-scoped sources of truth must use the unstructured format.
Create, or make sure you have access to, a cluster that is on a Google Kubernetes Engine
supported platform and version
and meets the
requirements for Config Sync .
Create a RoleBinding
A RoleBinding is required to grant permissions to the RepoSync that you
create in this guide. To create the RoleBinding, complete the following steps:
In the root source, declare a RoleBinding configuration that grants the
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME service account permission to
manage objects in the namespace. Config Sync automatically creates the
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME service account when the
RepoSync config is synced to the cluster.
A RoleBinding may reference a Role in the same namespace. Alternatively,
a RoleBinding can reference a ClusterRole and bind that ClusterRole to
the namespace of the RoleBinding . While you should adhere to the
principle of least privilege
by granting fine-grained permissions to a user-defined Role , you can define
a ClusterRole or use
user-facing roles ,
and reference the same ClusterRole in multiple RoleBindings across
different namespaces.
Note: A RoleBinding referencing a ClusterRole only gives you access to
the namespace of the RoleBinding , but not cluster-wide access.
Default ClusterRoles
Save the RoleBinding manifest that references a default ClusterRole , for
example admin or edit , as FILENAME :
kind : RoleBinding
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata :
name : syncs-repo
namespace : NAMESPACE
subjects :
- kind : ServiceAccount
name : SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
namespace : config-management-system
roleRef :
kind : ClusterRole
name : CLUSTERROLE_NAME
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
Replace the following:
FILENAME : the name for the RoleBinding manifest.
NAMESPACE : add the name of your namespace.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : add the name of the
reconciler's service account.
If the RepoSync name is repo-sync ,
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
is ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE . Otherwise, it is
ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE - REPO_SYNC_NAME - REPO_SYNC_NAME_LENGTH .
For example, if your RepoSync name is prod , then the
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME would be
ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE -prod-4 . The integer 4
is used as prod contains 4 characters.
CLUSTERROLE_NAME : add the name of the default
ClusterRole.
User-defined roles
You can declare a ClusterRole or a Role by granting a list of
permissions to each resource that is managed by the RepoSync object.
This allows for fine-grained permissions. See
referring to resources
for more details.
For example, the following ClusterRole or Role grants permissions to
manage Deployment and ServiceAccount objects:
# ROOT_REPO/namespaces/ NAMESPACE /sync-role.yaml
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ROLE_KIND
metadata :
namespace : NAMESPACE # only set this field for a 'Role'
name : RECONCILER_ROLE
rules :
# Update 'apiGroups' and 'resources' to reference actual resources managed by 'RepoSync'.
- apiGroups : [ "apps" ]
resources : [ "deployments" ]
verbs : [ "*" ]
- apiGroups : [ "" ]
resources : [ "serviceaccounts" ]
verbs : [ "*" ]
Save the RoleBinding manifest that references the ClusterRole or Role
as FILENAME :
# ROOT_REPO/namespaces/ NAMESPACE / FILENAME .yaml
kind : RoleBinding
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata :
name : syncs-repo
namespace : NAMESPACE
subjects :
- kind : ServiceAccount
name : SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
namespace : config-management-system
roleRef :
kind : ROLE_KIND
name : RECONCILER_ROLE
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
Replace the following:
FILENAME : the name for the RoleBinding manifest.
ROLE_KIND : set ClusterRole or Role .
NAMESPACE : add the name of your namespace.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : add the name of the
reconciler's service account.
If the RepoSync name is repo-sync ,
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
is ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE . Otherwise, it is
ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE - REPO_SYNC_NAME - REPO_SYNC_NAME_LENGTH .
For example, if your RepoSync name is prod , then the
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME would be
ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE -prod-4 . The integer 4
is used as prod contains 4 characters.
RECONCILER_ROLE : add the name of the
ClusterRole or Role .
Apply the RoleBinding:
kubectl apply -f FILENAME
Limitations
NamespaceSelectors
(including annotations pointing to Selectors) only work in a root source of
truth.
If you
installed Config Sync using the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI ,
Config Sync automatically created a RootSync object named root-sync .
Because of this, you can't name any of your RootSync objects root-sync .
Choose your preferred configuration method
Choose between one of the two methods for configuring your sources:
Control sources in a root source of truth .
This method centralizes all configuration of a source of truth in another
source of truth, allowing a central administrator complete control of the setup.
Control sources with the Kubernetes API .
Use this method if you want to delegate control of your source of truth to
different owners.
Control sources in a root source of truth
To control sources with a root source, you need a RoleBinding to authorize
access. If you don't have one, see the Create a RoleBinding section.
Control root sources in a root source of truth
Config Sync supports syncing from more than one source of truth. The central
administrator can use a root source of truth to manage all other sources. Because
Config Sync manages the RootSync objects, this method prevents any local
changes to RootSync configurations in the cluster.
To use this method, complete the following tasks:
Save one of the following manifests as root-sync.yaml . Use the manifest
version that corresponds to the source type for your configs.
Git
# root-sync.yaml
apiVersion : configsync.gke.io/v1beta1
kind : RootSync
metadata :
name : ROOT_SYNC_NAME
namespace : config-management-system

gcpServiceAccountEmail : ROOT_EMAIL
secretRef :
name : ROOT_SECRET_NAME
noSSLVerify : ROOT_NO_SSL_VERIFY
caCertSecretRef :
name : ROOT_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME
Replace the following:
ROOT_SYNC_NAME : add the name of your RootSync
object.
ROOT_REPOSITORY : add the URL of the Git repository to
use as the root repository. You can enter URLs using either the HTTPS
or SSH protocol. For example, https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-config-management-samples uses the HTTPS protocol.
This field is required.
ROOT_REVISION : add the Git revision (tag or
hash) or branch to sync from. This field is optional and the default value is
HEAD . When using a hash, it must be a full hash, and not an
abbreviated form.
ROOT_BRANCH : add the branch of the
repository to sync from. This field is optional and the default value
is master . We recommend using the revision field to specify a branch name for
simplicity. If both the revision field and the branch field are
specified, revision takes precedence over branch .
ROOT_DIRECTORY : add the path in the Git repository to
the root directory that contains the configuration that you want to sync
to. This field is optional and the default is the root directory ( / ) of
the repository.
ROOT_AUTH_TYPE : add one of the following authentication types:
none : Use no authentication
ssh : Use a SSH key pair
cookiefile : Use a cookiefile
token : Use a token
gcpserviceaccount : Use a Google service account to access a Cloud Source Repositories.
gcenode : Use a Google service account to access a
Cloud Source Repositories. Only select this option if Workload Identity Federation for GKE
is not enabled in your cluster.
For more information on these authentication types, see
Granting Config Sync read-only access to Git .
This field is required.
ROOT_EMAIL : If you added gcpserviceaccount as your
ROOT_AUTH_TYPE , add your Google service account email address. For example,
acm@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
ROOT_SECRET_NAME : add the name of your Secret. If this
field is set, you must add the Secret's public key to
the Git provider. This field is optional.
ROOT_NO_SSL_VERIFY : To disable
the SSL certificate verification, set this field to true . The default value is false .
ROOT_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME : add the name of your
Secret. If this field is set, your Git provider must be using a
certificate issued by this certificate authority (CA). The Secret must
contain the CA certificate under a key named cert . This field is
optional.
To learn more about how to configure the Secret object for the CA
certificate, see Configure Certificate Authority
For an explanation of the fields and a complete list of fields that you
can add to the spec field, see RootSync fields .
This manifest creates a RootSync object that uses Git as the source.
OCI

dir : ROOT_DIRECTORY
auth : ROOT_AUTH_TYPE
gcpServiceAccountEmail : ROOT_EMAIL
caCertSecretRef :
name : ROOT_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME
Replace the following:
ROOT_SYNC_NAME : add the name of your RootSync
object.
ROOT_IMAGE : the URL of the OCI image to use as the
root repository, for example LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / PACKAGE_NAME .
By default, the image is pulled from the latest tag, but you can pull in images by TAG or DIGEST instead.
Specify TAG or DIGEST in the PACKAGE_NAME :
To pull by TAG : LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / PACKAGE_NAME :TAG
To pull by DIGEST : LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / PACKAGE_NAME @sha256:DIGEST
Caution: Config Sync requires that the OCI layer is compressed in
the tar or tar+gzip .
Other formats (for example, tar+bz2 ) will not be recognized by
Config Sync. Switching from a valid REPO to an OCI image with
an unsupported format will cause managed resources to be pruned without
an error.
ROOT_DIRECTORY : add the path in the repository to
the root directory that contains the configuration that you want to sync
to. This field is optional and the default is the root directory ( / ) of
the repository.
ROOT_AUTH_TYPE : add one of the following authentication types:
none : Use no authentication
gcenode : Use the
Compute Engine default service account to access an image in
Artifact Registry. Only select this option if
Workload Identity Federation for GKE is not enabled in your cluster.
gcpserviceaccount : Use a Google service account to access an
image.
This field is required.
ROOT_EMAIL : If you added gcpserviceaccount as your
ROOT_AUTH_TYPE , add your Google service account email address. For example,
acm@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com .
ROOT_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME : add the name of your
Secret. If this field is set, your OCI provider must be using a
certificate issued by this certificate authority (CA). The Secret must
contain the CA certificate under a key named cert . This field is
optional.

This manifest creates a RootSync object that uses Helm as the source.
Commit the changes to the root source of truth:
git add .
git commit -m 'Setting up a new root source of truth.'
git push
You can repeat the above steps if you need to configure multiple root sources.
You can also store configurations of multiple RootSync objects in a root
source of truth synced by another RootSync object, to manage multiple
RootSync objects centrally in a GitOps fashion.
Control namespace-scoped objects in a root source of truth
Namespace-scoped sources of truth can be managed by a root source of truth. Because the
namespace-scoped sources are managed by Config Sync, this method
prevents any local changes to the namespace-scoped source definitions.
To use this method, complete the following tasks:
In the root source of truth, declare a namespace configuration:
# ROOT_SOURCE/namespaces/NAMESPACE/namespace.yaml
apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
name : NAMESPACE
Replace NAMESPACE with a name for your namespace.
In the root source of truth, create one of the following RepoSync
objects in the same namespace. Use the manifest that corresponds to the source
type for your configs:
Git
#ROOT_SOURCE/namespaces/NAMESPACE/repo-sync.yaml
apiVersion : configsync.gke.io/v1beta1
kind : RepoSync

caCertSecretRef :
name : NAMESPACE_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME
Replace the following:
REPO_SYNC_NAME : add the name of your RepoSync
object. The name should be unique across the namespace.
NAMESPACE : add the name of your namespace.
NAMESPACE_REPOSITORY : add the URL of the Git repository to
use as the namespace repository. You can enter URLs using either the HTTPS
or SSH protocol. For example,
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-config-management-samples uses
the HTTPS protocol. If you don't enter a protocol, the URL is treated
as an HTTPS URL. This field is required.
NAMESPACE_REVISION : add the Git revision (tag
or hash) or branch to sync from. This field is optional and the default value is
HEAD . When using a hash, it must be a full hash, and not an
abbreviated form.
NAMESPACE_BRANCH : add the branch of the
repository to sync from. This field is optional and the default value
is master . We recommend using the revision field to specify a branch name for
simplicity. If both the revision field and the branch field are
specified, revision takes precedence over branch .

none : Use no authentication
ssh : Use a SSH key pair
cookiefile : Use a cookiefile
token : Use a token
gcpserviceaccount : Use a Google service account to access a
repository in Cloud Source Repositories.
gcenode : Use a Google service account to access a repository in
Cloud Source Repositories. Only select this option if Workload Identity Federation for GKE
is not enabled in your cluster.
For more information on these authentication types, see

NAMESPACE_SECRET_NAME : add the name you intend to give your Secret.
This field is optional.
NAMESPACE_NO_SSL_VERIFY : To disable
the SSL certificate verification, set this field to true . The default value is false .
NAMESPACE_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME : add the name of your
Secret. If this field is set, your Git provider must be using a
certificate issued by this certificate authority (CA). The Secret must
contain the CA certificate under a key named cert . This field is
optional.

optional.
To learn more about how to configure the Secret object for the CA
certificate, see Configure Certificate Authority
For an explanation of the fields and a complete list of fields that you
can add to the spec field, see RootSync fields .
If you are using gcpserviceaccount as the auth type and don't have
Workload Identity Federation for GKE enabled, you must create an
IAM policy binding
between the Kubernetes service account for each namespace and the Google
service account. See
Grant access to Git
for instructions on how to create this binding.
Commit the changes to the root source of truth:
git add .
git commit -m 'Setting up a new namespace-scoped source of truth.'
git push
If required, create a Secret
based on your preferred authentication method. If you used none as your
authentication type, you can skip this step.
The Secret must meet following requirements:
Create the Secret in the same namespace as the RepoSync.
The Secret's name must match the spec.git.secretRef name you defined
in repo-sync.yaml .
You must add the Secret's public key to the Git provider.
To verify the configuration, use kubectl get on one of the objects in the
namespace source. For example:
kubectl get rolebindings -n NAMESPACE
You can repeat the above steps if you need to configure more than one namespace-scoped source.
Control namespace-scoped sources in a namespace-scoped source
Config Sync supports syncing from more than one namespace-scoped source of truth per
namespace. Namespace-scoped sources of truth can be managed in a namespace-scoped source of truth in
the same namespace.
To use this method, complete the following tasks:
In the namespace-scoped source of truth, create one of the following RepoSync
objects in the same namespace. Use the manifest that corresponds to the source

For an explanation of the fields and a complete list of fields that you
can add to the spec field, see RootSync fields .
If you are using gcpserviceaccount as the auth type and don't have
Workload Identity Federation for GKE enabled, you must create an
IAM policy binding
between the Kubernetes service account for each namespace and the Google
service account. See
Grant access to Git
for instructions on how to create this binding.
Commit the changes to the root source of truth:
git add .
git commit -m 'Setting up a new namespace-scoped source of truth.'
git push
If required, create a Secret
based on your preferred authentication method. If you used none as your
authentication type, you can skip this step.
The Secret must meet following requirements:
Create the Secret in the same namespace as the RepoSync.
The Secret's name must match the spec.git.secretRef name you defined
in repo-sync.yaml .
You must add the Secret's public key to the Git provider.
To verify the configuration, use kubectl get on one of the objects in the
namespace-scoped source of truth. For example:
kubectl get rolebindings -n NAMESPACE
You can repeat the above steps if you need to configure more than one namespace-scoped
source.
Control a source of truth with the Kubernetes API
In this method, the central administrator delegates declaration of other
RootSync objects to other administrators. For RepoSync objects, the central
administrator only declares the namespace in the root source of truth and delegates
declaration of the RepoSync object to the application operator.
Control more than one root source of truth
Other administrators can control a root source of truth by completing the following tasks:
Save one of the following manifests as root-sync.yaml . Use the manifest
version that corresponds to the source type for your configs.

This manifest creates a RootSync object that uses Helm as the source.
Apply the changes:
kubectl apply -f root-sync.yaml
You can repeat the above steps if you need to configure more than one root source of truth.
Control namespace-scoped sources of truth
Central administrator tasks
The central administrator completes the following tasks:
In the root source of truth, declare a namespace configuration for namespace-scoped sources.
# ROOT_REPO/namespaces/NAMESPACE/namespace.yaml
apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
name : NAMESPACE
Replace NAMESPACE with a name for your namespace.
In the root source of truth, declare a RoleBinding to give the
application operators permissions. Use
RBAC escalation prevention
to ensure that the application operator cannot later apply a role binding with
permissions not granted by this role binding.
To declare the RoleBinding, create the following manifest:
# ROOT_REPO/namespaces/NAMESPACE/operator-rolebinding.yaml
kind : RoleBinding
# Add RBAC escalation prevention
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata :
name : operator
namespace : NAMESPACE
subjects :
- kind : User
name : USERNAME
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef :
kind : ClusterRole
name : OPERATOR_ROLE
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
Replace the following:
NAMESPACE : add the namespace you created in the root source of truth.
USERNAME : add the username of the application operator.
OPERATOR_ROLE : as the central administrator, you can set
OPERATOR_ROLE to enforce what kinds of configurations can be
synced from the namespace-scoped source. You can choose one of the following
roles:
A default ClusterRole:
admin
edit
To learn more, see
User-facing roles .
A user-defined ClusterRole or Role declared in the root source of truth. This
role allows for fine grained permissions.
Commit the changes to the root source of truth:
git add .
git commit -m 'Setting up new namespace-scoped source of truth.'
git push
Application operator tasks
The application operator can control namespace-scoped sources by completing the
following tasks:
Declare a RoleBinding configuration that grants the auto-provisioned
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME service account permission
to manage objects in the namespace. Config Sync automatically creates
the SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME service account when
the RepoSync config is synced to the cluster.
To declare the RoleBinding, create the following manifest:
# sync-rolebinding.yaml
kind : RoleBinding
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata :
name : syncs-repo
namespace : NAMESPACE
subjects :
- kind : ServiceAccount
name : SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
namespace : config-management-system
roleRef :
kind : ClusterRole
name : RECONCILER_ROLE
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
Replace the following:
NAMESPACE : add the namespace you created in the root source of truth.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : add the name of the reconciler's service account.
If the RepoSync name is repo-sync , SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
is ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE . Otherwise, it is
ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE - REPO_SYNC_NAME .
RECONCILER_ROLE : as the application operator you can set
RECONCILER_ROLE to enforce
what kinds of configuration can be synced from the namespace-scoped source. You
can only further restrict the set of permissions the central administrator
has granted you. As a result, this role cannot be more permissive than the
OPERATOR_ROLE that the central administrator declared in the
previous section.
Apply the RoleBinding configuration:
kubectl apply -f sync-rolebinding.yaml
If required, create a Secret
based on your preferred authentication method. If you used none as your
authentication type, you can skip this step.
The Secret must meet the following requirements:
Create the Secret in the same namespace as the RepoSync.
The Secret's name must match the spec.git.secretRef name you defined
in root-sync.yaml .
You must add the Secret's public key to the Git provider.
Declare a RepoSync configuration:

ROOT_AUTH_TYPE , add your Google service account email address. For example,
acm@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com .
NAMESPACE_SECRET_NAME : add the
name of your Secret
if token is the ROOT_AUTH_TYPE . This field is optional.
NAMESPACE_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME : add the name of your
Secret. If this field is set, your Helm provider must be using a
certificate issued by this certificate authority (CA). The Secret must
contain the CA certificate under a key named cert . This field is
optional.

Apply the RepoSync configuration:
kubectl apply -f repo-sync.yaml
To verify the configuration, use kubectl get on one of the objects in the
namespace-scoped source. For example:
kubectl get rolebindings -n NAMESPACE
You can repeat the above steps if you need to configure multiple namespace-scoped source of truth .
Verify the sync status of the source of truth
You can use the nomos status command
to inspect the sync status of the source of truth:
nomos status
You should see output similar to the following example:
my_managed_cluster-1
--------------------
<root> git@github.com:foo-corp/acme/admin@main
SYNCED f52a11e4
--------------------
bookstore git@github.com:foo-corp/acme/bookstore@v1
SYNCED 34d1a8c8
In this example output, the namespace-scoped source, in this case a Git repository,
is configured for a namespace named bookstore .
Verify the RootSync installation
When you create a RootSync object, Config Sync creates a reconciler with the
root-reconciler prefix. A reconciler is a Pod that is deployed as a Deployment.
It syncs manifests from a source of truth to a cluster.
You can verify that the RootSync object is working correctly by checking the
status of the root-reconciler Deployment:
kubectl get -n config-management-system deployment \
-l configsync.gke.io/sync-name = ROOT_SYNC_NAME
Replace ROOT_SYNC_NAME with the name of RootSync.
You should see output similar to the following example:
NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
root-reconciler 1/1 1 1 3h42m
For further ways to explore the status of your RootSync object, see
Monitoring RootSync and RepoSync objects .
Verify the RepoSync installation
When you create a RepoSync object, Config Sync creates a reconciler with the
ns-reconciler- NAMESPACE prefix, where
NAMESPACE is the namespace you created your RepoSync
object in.
You can verify that the RepoSync object is working correctly
by checking the status of the namespace reconciler Deployment:
kubectl get -n config-management-system deployment \
-l configsync.gke.io/sync-name = REPO_SYNC_NAME \
-l configsync.gke.io/sync-namespace = NAMESPACE
Replace REPO_SYNC_NAME with the name of RepoSync, and
replace NAMESPACE with the namespace that you created
your namespace-scoped source of truth in.
For further ways to explore the status of your RepoSync object, see
Exploring the RootSync and RepoSync objects .
Remove a source of truth
Select the Central control method or Kubernetes API method tab to view
the relevant instructions.
Central control method
If you used the Control sources of truth in a root source of truth method,
a central administrator can follow the following two steps to remove a
source of truth:
Decide if you'd like to delete or keep the resources that are managed
through your RootSync and RepoSync objects.
To delete all the resources that your RootSync or RepoSync objects manage,
sync your RootSync or RepoSync object to an empty source. For example, a
GitHub repository with no configs. If your RootSync or RepoSync object
contains another RootSync or RepoSync object, the inner RootSync or
RepoSync needs to sync to an empty Git repository first.
If you've enabled the webhook
and want to keep your resources,
disable drift prevention for abandoned resources .
If you haven't enabled the webhook, you don't have to take any additional
steps to keep your resources.
Remove the RootSync or RepoSync object from the source of truth.
Kubernetes API method
If you used the Control namespace-scoped sources of truth with the Kubernetes API
method, application operators can use the following steps to remove a
namespace-scoped source of truth:
Decide if you'd like to delete or keep the resources that are managed
through your RootSync and RepoSync objects.
To delete all the resources that your RootSync or RepoSync objects manage,
sync your RootSync or RepoSync object to an empty source. For example, a
GitHub repository with no configs. If your RootSync or RepoSync object
contains another RootSync or RepoSync object, the inner RootSync or
RepoSync needs to sync to an empty Git repository first.
If you've enabled the webhook
and want to keep your resources, disable drift prevention for abandoned resources .
If you haven't enabled the webhook, you don't have to take any additional
steps to keep your resources.
Delete the RootSync or RepoSync object by running the following command:
kubectl delete -f FILE_NAME
Replace FILE_NAME with the name of your RootSync
or RepoSync configuration file. For example, root-sync.yaml .
