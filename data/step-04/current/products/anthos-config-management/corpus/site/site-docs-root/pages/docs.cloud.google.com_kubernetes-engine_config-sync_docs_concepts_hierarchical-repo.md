Use a hierarchical repository
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how Config Sync reads configs
from a hierarchical source of truth and applies the resulting configuration to your
clusters automatically.
We recommend that you use an unstructured source of truth
instead of hierarchical because it provides the same core
capabilities, but gives you more flexibility in organizing your resources.
If you already use a hierarchical source of truth, you can
convert it to an unstructured source of truth .
To understand how Config Sync uses a hierarchical repository, it's helpful
if you're familiar with Git repositories and the git command-line
interface.
You can
view an example of how to organize and configure a hierarchical source of truth
in the Config Sync samples repository.
Structure of the directory
For hierarchical sources, Config Sync takes advantage of
filesystem-like structures, and uses the directory to determine which clusters or namespaces
a config is relevant to.
namespaces/
The namespaces/ directory contains configs for namespaces and namespace-scoped
objects. The structure within namespaces/ is the mechanism that drives
namespace inheritance .
You can limit which namespaces can inherit a config, by using a
NamespaceSelector .
cluster/
The cluster/ directory contains configs that apply to entire clusters, rather
than to namespaces. By default, any config in the cluster/ directory applies
to every cluster enrolled in Config Sync. You can limit which
clusters a config can affect by using a
ClusterSelector .
Note: Namespaces are configured within namespaces/ , even though they are
cluster-scoped.
clusterregistry/
The clusterregistry/ directory is optional, and contains configs for
ClusterSelectors .
ClusterSelectors limit which clusters a config applies to, and are referenced in
configs found in the cluster/ and namespaces/ directories.
system/
The system/ directory contains configs for the Operator.
Example hierarchical source of truth
The following directory structure demonstrates how to use a Config Sync
hierarchical source of truth to configure a Kubernetes cluster shared by two
different teams, team-1 and team-2 .
Each team has its own Kubernetes namespace, Kubernetes service account, resource
quotas, network policies, rolebindings.
The cluster administrator sets up a policy in namespaces/limit-range.yaml to
constrain resource allocations (to Pods or containers) in both namespaces.
The cluster administrator also sets up ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings.
A valid Config Sync hierarchical source must include
three subdirectories: cluster/ , namespaces/ , and system/ .
The cluster/ directory contains configs that apply to entire clusters
(such as ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding), rather than to namespaces.
The namespaces/ directory contains configs for the namespace objects and the
namespace-scoped objects. Each subdirectory under namespaces/ includes the
configs for a namespace object and all the namespace-scoped objects under the
namespace. The name of a subdirectory should be the same as the name of the
namespace object. Namespace-scoped objects which need to be created in each
namespace, can be put directly under namespaces/ (for example,
namespaces/limit-range.yaml ).
The system/ directory contains configs for the ConfigManagement Operator.

Use namespace inheritance and abstract namespaces
With a hierarchical source of truth, you can use the concept of namespace
inheritance to automatically apply configs to groups of namespaces in all the
clusters where those namespaces
exist (or should exist).
Namespace inheritance applies to the namespaces/
directory of the hierarchical repository and all its subdirectories. Configs in
other directories in the repository, such as cluster/ , are not subject to
inheritance.
In a hierarchical source of truth, the
namespaces/ directory can contain two different types of subdirectories:
A namespace directory contains a config for a namespace. The name of the
file containing the config is not important, but the config must have
kind: Namespace . A namespace directory can also contain configs for
other kinds of Kubernetes objects. A namespace directory cannot contain
subdirectories. A namespace config represents an actual namespace in a
cluster.
An abstract namespace directory contains namespace directories. It can
also contain configs for other Kubernetes objects, but it cannot directly
contain a config for a namespace. An abstract namespace directory does not
represent an object in a Kubernetes cluster, but its descendant namespace
directories do.
To help ensure that your namespace and abstract namespace sources have the
correct type of configs and structure, error KNV1003: IllegalNamespaceSubdirectoryError
reports when there is a problem.
Configs in a namespace directory only apply to that namespace. However, configs in
an abstract namespace directory are applied to all of that abstract namespace's
descendant namespace directories (or those descendant namespaces that match a
config's
NamespaceSelector , if one is present).
Inheritance of a config in the namespaces/ directory is based largely
on its location within the directory tree in the source of truth. To understand which
configs are being applied to a given namespace in a given cluster, you can
browse the
namespace inheritance example repository .
Restricted namespaces
config-management-system is a restricted namespace. You cannot use it as
an abstract namespace directory. You can define a
config-management-system namespace, but the only permitted resource type
for the config-management-system namespace is RootSync .
Making changes in your source of truth
When you make a change in your source of truth that creates or deletes namespace directories from within the
namespaces/ directory, you might get unexpected results depending on the action:
Caution: By default, Git repositories don't provide fine-grained access
control. If the set of people with commit rights to your repository is not exactly
the same as the set of users allowed to create, modify, or delete Kubernetes
objects in your clusters, consider using an access control mechanism such as
OWNERS or CODEOWNERS files in your repository.
Creating a directory : when a valid namespaces/ hierarchy
is committed to the source of truth, Config Sync creates namespaces, and
then creates Kubernetes objects in those namespaces for each config that the
namespace directory contains or inherits.
Deleting a directory : deleting a namespace directory is
a destructive operation. The namespace, and its contents, is deleted,
on every cluster managed by Config Sync where the namespace exists. If you
delete an abstract namespace directory containing descendant namespace
directories, all of those namespaces and their contents are deleted from
every cluster managed by Config Sync.
Renaming a directory : Renaming a namespace directory is a deletion, followed by a
creation and is considered a destructive operation. Renaming an abstract namespace
directory has no externally visible effect.
Note: If you rename a namespace directory, remember to also update its name in
the config for the namespace.
Moving a directory : moving a namespace or an abstract namespace directory within namespaces/
does not delete the namespace or objects within it, except where the namespace
starts or stops inheriting a config from an abstract namespace directory, due
to a change in its hierarchy.
