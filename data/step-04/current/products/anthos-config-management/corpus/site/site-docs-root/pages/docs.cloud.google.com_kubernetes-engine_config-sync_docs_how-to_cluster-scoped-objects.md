Configure clusters and cluster-scoped objects
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to configure clusters and cluster-scoped objects. You can
also read about
configuring namespaces and namespace-scoped objects .
Configure clusters and cluster-scoped objects
In unstructured repositories, you can
organize configs for clusters and cluster-scoped
objects in the way that's most convenient for you. All configs organized this way
apply to every cluster enrolled in Config Sync.
Configure CustomResourceDefinitions
Config Sync lets you sync CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs)
the same way you would sync any other resource. There are a few things to keep
in mind when syncing CRDs:
Updates to CRDs and their corresponding CustomResources do not occur in any
predictable order. If you modify CRDs and the corresponding CustomResources
in the same commit, there is no expectation that CRD updates occur before
Custom Resource updates. This might cause the nomos status to report a
transient error for a brief period of time, until both the CustomResource
and the CRD are present in the cluster.
Config Sync does not allow removal of a CRD if any CustomResource
in the repo depends on it. To remove a CRD, you also need to remove its
CustomResource. We recommend that you remove them both in the same commit to
the repo.
You can sync a CustomResource without syncing its CRD, as long as you can
guarantee that the CRD already exists in the cluster.
Limit which clusters a config affects
By default, Config Sync applies a config to every enrolled cluster. However,
if you need to apply a config to only a subset of clusters, you can either add a
cluster-name-selector annotation or a
ClusterSelector config to your repository.
The cluster-name-selector annotation provides a simple way to specify a subset
of clusters to apply a config to. This option only supports selecting clusters
by names.
The ClusterSelector object supports selecting clusters by labels, but it
requires more complex configurations.
Both options require clusterName to be specified in Config Sync on
the cluster. Depending on how you installed Config Sync, you can provide the
cluster name in the following ways:
If you installed Config Sync by using Google Cloud CLI or Google Cloud console :
clusterName is automatically set to the fleet membership name.
If you installed Config Sync manually by using kubectl , you must set the
CLUSTER_NAME environment variable on the reconciler-manager deployment.
For more information, see
Provide a cluster name for cluster selectors .
Configure using the cluster-name-selector annotation
You can apply a config to a subset of clusters with the
configsync.gke.io/cluster-name-selector annotation. You can use
this annotation to apply a config to a set of clusters, denoted by cluster names.
The value of the annotation is a comma-separated list of target cluster names.
You can apply the annotation on cluster-scoped objects and namespace-scoped
objects. Namespace objects are selected when the annotation matches the cluster
name and when the namespace that the clusters belong to is also selected.
Select a single cluster
The following config creates a Role called namespace-reader that defines a set
of permissions for reading namespaces. This Role is only applied on the cluster
that has the name cluster-1 .
kind : Role
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata :
namespace : my-namespace
name : namespace-reader
annotations :
configsync.gke.io/cluster-name-selector : cluster-1
rules :
- apiGroups : [ "" ]
resources : [ "namespaces" ]
verbs : [ "get" , "watch" , "list" ]
Select a list of clusters
The following config creates the same Role as the previous example, but this
Role is only applied on the clusters that have the name cluster-1 ,
cluster-2 , or cluster-3 .
kind : Role
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata :
namespace : my-namespace
name : namespace-reader
annotations :
configsync.gke.io/cluster-name-selector : cluster-1,cluster-2,cluster-3
rules :
- apiGroups : [ "" ]
resources : [ "namespaces" ]
verbs : [ "get" , "watch" , "list" ]
Configure using the ClusterSelector object
A ClusterSelector is a special type of config that uses Kubernetes
labelSelectors .
You can use a ClusterSelector to limit which clusters a particular config
applies to, based on the cluster's labels. You can also use ClusterSelectors to
limit which clusters instantiate a namespace-scoped object.
Like other labelSelectors, ClusterSelectors operate using AND logic. Since
ClusterSelectors use AND logic, objects are only selected when they match all of
the labels that you define.
A ClusterSelector config does not persist in a cluster. Instead, you reference
it in another config using an annotation, and that config only applies to
clusters that match the ClusterSelector.
Before you can use ClusterSelectors, each cluster must have a unique name and a
set of labels that can be selected. The cluster metadata is specified in a
Cluster config in your source of truth.
Next, you add labels to a cluster ,
create the ClusterSelector , then
reference it in another config .
Note: The Cluster and ClusterSelector configs are only used to filter the
cluster-specific configurations and will not be applied to the cluster.
Add labels to a cluster
To use ClusterSelectors, each cluster must have a set of labels that can be
selected. In unstructured repositories, Cluster configs can be stored
arbitrarily in the config directory or its descendant directories.
To apply configs to a cluster, the metadata.name field of the Cluster config
must match the
clusterName field
of your ConfigManagement object.
The following example Cluster config declares that cluster-2 has the
environment: prod and location: central labels.
kind : Cluster
apiVersion : clusterregistry.k8s.io/v1alpha1
metadata :
name : cluster-2
labels :
environment : prod
location : central
You can also apply annotations using a Cluster config.
Note: The labels defined in the Cluster config are different from
GKE cluster labels .
Create a ClusterSelector
A ClusterSelector selects only clusters with a given label or combination
of labels. In unstructured repositories, ClusterSelectors can be stored
arbitrarily in the sync directory or its descendant directories.
The following ClusterSelector selects only clusters with the
environment: prod label.
kind : ClusterSelector
apiVersion : configmanagement.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : selector-env-prod
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
environment : prod
The following ClusterSelector selects any clusters with the
location: central or location: west labels.
kind : ClusterSelector
apiVersion : configmanagement.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : selector-central-or-west
spec :
selector :
matchExpressions :
- key : location
operator : In
values :
- central
- west
A ClusterSelector has no effect until you
reference it in another config .
Reference a ClusterSelector
To reference a ClusterSelector in another config, set the annotation
configmanagement.gke.io/cluster-selector: CLUSTERSELECTOR-NAME .
The following config creates a ClusterRole called namespace-reader that
defines a set of permissions for reading namespaces. This ClusterRole is only
instantiated on clusters that match the selector-env-prod ClusterSelector.
kind : ClusterRole
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata :
name : namespace-reader
annotations :
configmanagement.gke.io/cluster-selector : selector-env-prod
rules :
- apiGroups : [ "" ]
resources : [ "namespaces" ]
verbs : [ "get" , "watch" , "list" ]
Limit the clusters a namespace-scoped config affects
By default, Config Sync applies configs inherited by a namespace to
that namespace in each cluster where it exists. You can use a ClusterSelector
to apply the config to only a subset of those clusters.
Note: ClusterSelectors are similar to but not identical to
NamespaceSelectors .
A NamespaceSelector narrows the pool of namespaces that can inherit a given
config from an abstract namespace, regardless of the directory structure of the
namespaces/ directory.
A ClusterSelector narrows the pool of clusters a config
applies to, whether the config is focused on a cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped
object.
For example, you can configure clusters differently based on their geographic
location or the geographic location of their clients. This configuration can
be useful for localization or for legal compliance. The examples in this section
apply locale-specific configs to only clusters with the label location: france .
The following Cluster config adds an location: france label to a
cluster called cluster-1 :
kind : Cluster
apiVersion : clusterregistry.k8s.io/v1alpha1
metadata :
name : cluster-1
labels :
location : france
Create a ClusterSelector config that references the labels you want to
select. The following ClusterConfig selects the location: france label:
kind : ClusterSelector
apiVersion : configmanagement.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : selector-location-france
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
location : france
A ClusterSelector has no effect until you reference it in another config.
The following RoleBinding config selects only clusters that match the
selector-location-france ClusterSelector. This configuration might be useful,
for instance, if a compliance guideline only allowed a particular service
account to view information on clusters in their designated geographic region.
kind : RoleBinding
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata :
name : viewers
annotations :
configmanagement.gke.io/cluster-selector : selector-location-france
subjects :
- kind : Group
name : system:serviceaccounts:foo
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef :
kind : ClusterRole
name : view
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
If you place this config in an abstract namespace or a namespace directory, such
as namespaces/eng , it is applied to the namespaces that inherit it, but only
on clusters with the location: france label.
