Configure Config Sync with kubectl commands
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to configure Config Sync using kubectl commands
after you've
installed Config Sync using the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI .
While you can make many configuration changes using the console or CLI, you
need to use kubectl commands to
override some Config Sync defaults , to control SSL certificate
verification, and to use a certificate authority.
Create and edit the RootSync configuration file
To configure Config Sync using kubectl commands, you edit a
RootSync object by creating
a YAML file.
When you install Config Sync using the Google Cloud console or
Google Cloud CLI, Config Sync automatically creates a RootSync object named
root-sync . This object contains the most recent configuration information for
Config Sync. Whenever you make a change in the Google Cloud console or
Google Cloud CLI, root-sync is updated.
Learn about the fields you can edit using kubectl
You can make advanced changes to root-sync using kubectl commands for the
fields not supported in the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI. If you want to
create and then update RootSync or RepoSync objects directly using kubectl
commands, see
RootSync and RepoSync fields .
Before you make any changes to the YAML file that you create in the following
section, familiarize yourself with the following table. This table lists the
fields that you can edit and add. If you edit fields not listed in this table,
Config Sync automatically reverts changes back to the values you set when you
last configured Config Sync in the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI.
Key
Description
spec.helm
All fields for Helm repository configuration.
spec.override
All fields for overriding default configurations.
spec.git.noSSLVerify
Specifies whether to enable or disable SSL certificate verification for Git. The default is false .
spec.git.caCertSecretRef.name
The name of the Secret containing the certificate authority (CA) certificate for a Git repository.
spec.oci.caCertSecretRef.name
The name of the Secret containing the certificate authority (CA) certificate for an OCI repository.
Note: Changes to fields that aren't in the preceding table are only reverted for
the RootSync object that Config Sync creates when you install using the
Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI. If you manually created a RootSync object
named root-sync using an alternate installation method, you can edit all of
the fields listed in
RootSync and RepoSync fields .
Create the file
To create and edit a configuration file for root-sync , complete the
following steps:
To make sure that you're retrieving the configuration information for the
correct cluster, configure kubectl command-line access:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--zone ZONE \
--project PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster that has
the Config Sync configuration that you want to change
ZONE : the zone that you created your cluster in
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
Copy the configuration information from the RootSync object that
Config Sync created into a YAML file:
kubectl get rootsync root-sync -n config-management-system -o yaml >
FILE_NAME .yaml
Replace FILE_NAME with a name for your configuration
file.
Open the YAML file that you created and make the required configuration
changes. For example, to override the memory limit of the git-sync
container, add the following fields in bold:
apiVersion : v1
items :
- apiVersion : configsync.gke.io/v1beta1
kind : RootSync
metadata :
annotations :
configmanagement.gke.io/managed-by-hub : "true"
configmanagement.gke.io/update-time : "1644945169"
creationTimestamp : "2022-02-15T17:12:52Z"
generation : 1
name : root-sync
namespace : config-management-system
resourceVersion : "211980457"
uid : aa30a94b-2825-4590-ad30-5af848403502
spec :
git :
auth : none
branch : main
dir : /quickstart/config-sync
period : 15s
repo : https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-config-management-samples
revision : HEAD
secretRef : {}
override :
resources :
- containerName : "git-sync"
memoryLimit : "400Mi"
sourceFormat : unstructured
# Remainder of RootSync omitted
Apply the changes to the YAML file:
kubectl apply -f FILE_NAME .yaml
To verify that Config Sync has applied your changes, view the RootSync
object:
kubectl describe rootsync root-sync -n config-management-system
To verify that your changes haven't introduced any errors, use the
nomos status command:
nomos status
Configure Certificate Authority
For servers configured with certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA)
that is not already trusted, Config Sync can be configured to use a CA
certificate to verify HTTPS connections to the server. This is supported for Git,
Helm, or OCI servers. The CA certificate
must include full SSL certificates (Root/Intermediate/Leaf).
If your server is already using a trusted CA or you are not connecting over HTTPS,
you can skip this step and leave caCertSecretRef unset.
RootSync
Fetch the CA certificate which was used to issue the certificate for your
Git server and save it to a file.
For RootSync objects, the Secret must be created in the config-management-system
namespace. For example:
kubectl create secret generic ROOT_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME
--namespace=config-management-system
--from-file=cert= /path/to/CA_CERT_FILE
When you configure the RootSync object,
set the value of the caCertSecretRef.name field in the RootSync
object to ROOT_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME .
RepoSync
Fetch the CA certificate which was used to issue the certificate for your
Git server and save it to a file.
For RepoSync objects, the Secret must be created in the same namespace as the
RepoSync. For example:
kubectl create secret generic NAMESPACE_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME
--namespace= REPO_SYNC_NAMESPACE
--from-file=cert= /path/to/CA_CERT_FILE
When you configure the RepoSync ,
set the value of the caCertSecretRef.name field in the RepoSync
object to NAMESPACE_CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME .
Remove the RootSync object
To delete root-sync , run the following command:
kubectl delete -f FILE_NAME
Replace FILE_NAME with the name of your RootSync
configuration file. For example, root-sync.yaml .
Deleting a RootSync or RepoSync object does not clean up Config Sync
annotations and labels. To clean up any managed resources, sync from an empty
Git directory.
