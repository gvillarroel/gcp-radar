View API Gateway APIs in API hub
This page describes how to view your API Gateway APIs in API hub using the Google Cloud console
or API. For more information, see List API resources .
Note: Only APIs and API configurations with at
least one active and deployed API Gateway are available in API hub.
API Gateway continuously monitors for changes in your API Gateway APIs and removes
API metadata for gateways that are no longer active or deployed.
View API Gateway APIs in API hub as described below.
Google Cloud console
To view your API Gateway APIs in API hub, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the APIs page in API hub .
Go to API hub
Click View in API hub on the API Gateway APIs page.
-->
Select Gateway: API Gateway in the Filter drop-down to display all API Gateway APIs. The main API Catalog page opens showing all available APIs.
Click an API to view more details.
The following table describes the API hub fields and maps them to the API Gateway equivalents. See also Manage attributes in the API hub documentation for information about the other system and user-defined attributes.

REST
To list all API Gateway APIs in API hub, use the List APIs API. By adding the plugin instance filter, you can list only the API assets for the specified API Gateway plugin instance.
For example:
curl 'https://apihub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ HUB_PROJECT_ID /locations/ HUB_LOCATION /apis?filter=source_metadata.plugin_instance_action_source.plugin_instance="projects/ HUB_PROJECT_ID /locations/ HUB_LOCATION /plugins/ PLUGIN_TYPE /instances/ PLUGIN_INSTANCE_ID "' \
-X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
Replace the following:
HUB_PROJECT_ID : The name of your API hub host project. The host project was selected
when API hub was provisioned.
HUB_LOCATION : The location of the host project. The location was chosen when API
hub was provisioned.
PLUGIN_TYPE : Type of plugin. Set to system-api-gateway .
PLUGIN_INSTANCE_ID : ID of the API Gateway plugin instance. Use the list plugin instances API to get the plugin instance ID.
The following provides an example of the response.
