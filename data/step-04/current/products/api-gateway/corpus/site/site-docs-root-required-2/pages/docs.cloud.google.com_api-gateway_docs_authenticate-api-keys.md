Use API Keys
This page describes how to use API keys in API Gateway.
Overview
An API key is a string that identifies a
Google Cloud project for quota, billing, and monitoring purposes. Developers generate an API key in a project in the Google Cloud console. They then
embed that key in every call to your API as a query parameter or in a request header.
If you specify an API key requirement in your API config,
API Gateway uses the API key to look up the associated Google Cloud project. API Gateway rejects requests unless
the API key was generated in your Google Cloud project or within other
Google Cloud projects in which your API has been enabled.
Note: Unlike credentials that use short-lived tokens or signed requests, API keys are included as
part of the API request. As a result, API keys are susceptible to
man-in-the-middle attacks
and are less secure than other authentication credentials. You can use API keys in addition to
one of the other supported forms of authentication , but we don't recommend using only API keys when API calls contain sensitive data.
Create an API key
Create an API key, or view API keys already available within your Google Cloud project, go to the APIs & Services > Credentials page and complete the steps described in Create an API key .
Go to Credentials
Configure API key authentication for API Gateway
Configure API key authentication for API Gateway to secure access to your gateway using an API key, as
described in the following sections.
Enable API key support for your service.
Google Cloud console
Do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to APIs & Services > Library .
Go to APIs & Services Library
In the search bar, enter the Managed Service name of the API. You can find this value in the Managed Service column for your API on the APIs landing page. For example:
my-api-123abc456def1.apigateway.my-project.cloud.goog
Click the service card to view the landing page.
On the landing page for your service, click Enable .
Note : There may be a delay of up to 30 minutes or more between the time you create your API and the time it appears in the Library.
Google Cloud CLI
Enter the following command, where MANAGED_SERVICE_NAME specifies the name of the managed service created when you deployed the API. This can be viewed in the Managed Service property listed with the gcloud api-gateway apis describe command.
gcloud services enable MANAGED_SERVICE_NAME
For example:
gcloud services enable my-api-123abc456def1.apigateway.my-project.cloud.goog
Modify the OpenAPI specification used to create your API config to include instructions to enforce an API key validation security policy on all traffic. Add the security type and securityDefinitions or securitySchemes as shown:
OpenAPI 2.0
# openapi2-functions.yaml
swagger : '2.0'
info :
title : API_ID optional-string
description : Sample API on API Gateway with a Google Cloud Functions backend
version : 1.0.0
schemes :
- https
produces :
- application/json
paths :
/hello :
get :
summary : Greet a user
operationId : hello
x-google-backend :
address : https:// GCP_REGION - PROJECT_ID .cloudfunctions.net/helloGET
security :
- api_key : []
responses :
'200' :
description : A successful response
schema :
type : string
securityDefinitions :
# This section configures basic authentication with an API key.
api_key :
type : "apiKey"
name : "key"
in : "query"
The securityDefinition configures your API to require an API key
passed as a query parameter named key when requesting access to
all paths defined in the spec.
OpenAPI 3.x
# openapi-functions.yaml
openapi : 3.0.4
info :
title : API_ID optional-string
description : Sample API on API Gateway with a Google Cloud Functions backend
version : 1.0.0
# Define reusable components in x-google-api-management
x-google-api-management :
backends :
functions_backend :
address : https:// GATEWAY_LOCATION - PROJECT_ID .cloudfunctions.net/helloGET
pathTranslation : APPEND_PATH_TO_ADDRESS
protocol : "http/1.1"
# Apply the backend configuration by referencing it by name. Set at the root so this applies to all operations unless overridden.
x-google-backend : functions_backend
components :
# This section configures basic authentication with an API key.
securitySchemes :
google_api_key :
type : apiKey
name : x-api-key
in : header
security :
- google_api_key : []
paths :
/hello :
get :
summary : Greet a user
operationId : hello
responses :
'200' :
description : A successful response
content :
application/json :
schema :
type : string
The securitySchemes configures your API to require an API key passed as a query parameter named key when requesting access to all paths defined in the spec.
Create a new API config with the modified OpenAPI description using the following command:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create NEW_CONFIG_ID \
--api= API_ID --openapi-spec= NEW_API_DEFINITION \
--project= PROJECT_ID --backend-auth-service-account= SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
For example:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create my-config-key \
--api= my-api --openapi-spec= openapi-functions.yaml \
--project= my-project --backend-auth-service-account= 0000000000000compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Run the following command to update your existing gateway with the new API config:
gcloud api-gateway gateways update GATEWAY_ID \
--api= API_ID --api-config= NEW_CONFIG_ID \
--location= GATEWAY_LOCATION --project= PROJECT_ID
For example:
gcloud api-gateway gateways update my-gateway \
--api= my-api --api-config= my-config-key \
--location= us-central1 --project= my-project
Restrict API keys
By default, API keys are unrestricted, which makes them vulnerable to unauthorized use. Add application restrictions and API restrictions whenever possible.
API restrictions specify which APIs can be called using the API key. All API keys used by production applications should have API restrictions.
Application restrictions specify which websites, IP addresses, or apps can use an API key. For more information, see Add application restrictions .
Aside: Note : If you use HTTP referrers (websites) as an application restriction, you must include a scheme (for example, https:// ) when you add the website restriction. For example, https://example.com/* is a valid restriction, but example.com/* is not.
To add API restrictions:
Find the title of the API as noted in your API Config. In the following example, the API title is My Example Config :
OpenAPI 2.0
# openapi.yaml
swagger : '2.0'
info :
title : My Example Config
description : Sample API on API Gateway
version : 1.0.0
...
OpenAPI 3.x
# openapi.yaml
openapi : 3.0.4
info :
title : My Example Config
description : Sample API on API Gateway
version : 1.0.0
...
In the Google Cloud console, go to the APIs & Services > Credentials page.
Go to Credentials
Select the name of the API key you want to use for your API.
In the API restrictions section of the API key detail page, click Restrict key .
Select the API that your API key will be used to access from the drop-down list of available APIs. For example, select My Example Config .
Click Save .
Your restriction should take effect momentarily.
Use API keys
To use API Gateway features such as
quotas , you can pass in an API
key so that API Gateway can identify the Google Cloud project
that the client application is associated with.
For example, you can pass it using the key query parameter in a curl call, as follows:
https:// GATEWAY_URL /hello?key= API_KEY
