Authentication between services
In addition to authenticating end user requests, you may want to authenticate services (non-human users) that make requests to your API. This page explains how to use service accounts to provide authentication for humans or services.
Overview
To identify a service that sends requests to your API, you use a
service account .
The calling service
uses the service account's private key to sign a secure
JSON Web Token (JWT)
and sends the signed JWT in the request to your API.
To implement service account authentication in your API and calling service:
Create a service account and key for the calling service to use.
Add support for authentication in the API config for your
API Gateway service.
Add code to the calling service that:
Creates a JWT and signs it with the service account's private key.
Sends the signed JWT in a request to the API.
API Gateway validates that the claims in the JWT match the
configuration in your API config before forwarding the request
to your API. API Gateway doesn't check for
Cloud Identity
permissions that you have granted on the service account.
Prerequisites
This page assumes that you have already:
Created a Google Cloud project .
Created an OpenAPI document describing your API .
Created an API config .
Create a service account with a key
You need a service account with a private key file that the calling service uses
to sign the JWT. If you have more than one service sending requests to your API,
you can create one service account to represent all the calling services. If you
need to differentiate between the services—for example, they might have
different permissions—you can create a service account and key for each calling
service.
This section shows how to use the Google Cloud console and the gcloud
command-line tool to create the service account and private key file and to
assign the service account the
Service Account Token Creator
role. For information on using an API to do this task, see
Create and manage service accounts .
Note:
Service account keys are a security risk if not managed correctly. You should
choose a more secure alternative to service account keys
whenever possible. If you must authenticate with a service account key, you are responsible for the
security of the private key and for other operations described by
Best practices for managing service account keys .
If you are prevented from creating a service account key, service account key creation might
be disabled for your organization. For more information, see
Managing secure-by-default organization resources .
If you acquired the service account key from an external source, you must validate it before use.
For more information, see
Security requirements for externally sourced credentials .
To create a service account with a key:
Google Cloud console
Create a service account:
In the Google Cloud console, go to Create service account .
Go to Create service account
Select a project.
In the Service account name field, enter a name. The
Google Cloud console fills in the Service account ID field based on
this name.
Optional: In the Service account description field, enter a
description.
Click Create .
Click the Select a role field.
Under All roles , select Service Accounts > Service Account
Token Creator .
Click Continue .
Click Done to finish creating the service account.
Don't close your browser window. You will use it in the next procedure.
Create a service account key:
In the Google Cloud console, click the email address for the service
account that you created.
Click Keys .
Click Add key , then Create new key .
Click Create . A JSON key file is downloaded to your computer.
Click Close .
gcloud
You can run the following commands by using the Google Cloud CLI on your local
machine, or within Cloud Shell.
Set the default account for gcloud . If you have more than one account,
make sure to choose the account that is in the Google Cloud project
that you want to use.
gcloud auth login
Display the project IDs for your Google Cloud projects.
gcloud projects list
Set the default project. Replace PROJECT_ID with
the Google Cloud project ID that you want to use.
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Create a service account. Replace SA_NAME and
SA_DISPLAY_NAME with the name and display name
that you want to use.
gcloud iam service-accounts create SA_NAME \
--display-name " SA_DISPLAY_NAME "
Display the email address for the service account that you just created.
gcloud iam service-accounts list
Add the Service Account Token Creator role. Replace
SA_EMAIL_ADDRESS with the service account's
email address.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member serviceAccount: SA_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
--role roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
Create a service account key file in the current working directory.
Replace FILE_NAME with the name that you want to
use for key file. By default, the gcloud command creates a JSON file.
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create FILE_NAME .json \
--iam-account SA_EMAIL_ADDRESS
See the
gcloud reference
for more information about the previous commands.
For information on safeguarding the private key, see
Best practices to manage credentials .
Configure your API to support authentication
When you create an API config for your gateway, you specify a service account that your gateway uses to interact with other services. To enable service account authentication for services calling your gateway, modify the security objects in your API config. The modifications will vary based on the OpenAPI specification version used.
To configure API Gateway to validate the claims in the signed JWT used by calling services:
OpenAPI 2.0
Add the service account as an issuer in your API config:
securityDefinitions :
DEFINITION_NAME :
authorizationUrl : ""
flow : "implicit"
type : "oauth2"
x-google-issuer : " SA_EMAIL_ADDRESS "
x-google-jwks_uri : "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/ SA_EMAIL_ADDRESS "
Replace DEFINITION_NAME with a string that
identifies this security definition. You might want to replace it with the
service account name or a name that identifies the calling service.
Replace SA_EMAIL_ADDRESS with the service
account's email address.
You can define multiple security definitions in your API config, but
each definition must have a different x-google-issuer . If you have
created separate service accounts for each calling service, you can
create a security definition for each service account, for example:
securityDefinitions :
service-1 :
authorizationUrl : ""
flow : "implicit"
type : "oauth2"
x-google-issuer : "service-1@example-project-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
x-google-jwks_uri : "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/service-1@example-project-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
service-2 :
authorizationUrl : ""
flow : "implicit"
type : "oauth2"
x-google-issuer : "service-2@example-project-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
x-google-jwks_uri : "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/service-2@example-project-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
Optionally, add x-google-audiences to the securityDefinitions section. If
you don't add x-google-audiences , API Gateway requires that the
"aud" (audience) claim in the JWT is in the format
https:// SERVICE_NAME , where
SERVICE_NAME is the name of your API Gateway
service, which you have configured in the host field of your OpenAPI
document.
Add a security section at either the top level of the file (not
indented or nested) to apply to the entire API, or at the method level
to apply to a specific method. If you use security sections at both the API
level and at the method level, the method-level settings override the
API-level settings.
security :
- DEFINITION_NAME : []
Replace DEFINITION_NAME with the name that you
used in the securityDefinitions section.
If you have more than one definition in the securityDefinitions section,
add them in the security section, for example:
security:
- service-1: []
- service-2: []
Deploy your updated API config . Before API Gateway forwards a request to your API, API Gateway
verifies:
The signature of the JWT by using the public key, which is located at the URI
specified in the x-google-jwks_uri field in your API config.
That the "iss" (issuer) claim in the JWT matches the value specified in the
x-google-issuer field.
That the "aud" (audience) claim in the JWT contains your
API Gateway service name or matches one of the values that you
specified in the x-google-audiences field.
That the token isn't expired by using the "exp" (expiration time) claim.
OpenAPI 3.x
Add the service account as an issuer in your API config:
components :
securitySchemes :
SCHEME_NAME :
type : oauth2
flows :
implicit :
authorizationUrl : ""
scopes : {}
x-google-auth :
issuer : SA_EMAIL_ADDRESS
jwksUri : https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/ SA_EMAIL_ADDRESS
security :
- SCHEME_NAME : []
Replace SCHEME_NAME with a string that
identifies this security scheme. You might want to replace it with the
service account name or a name that identifies the calling service.
Replace SA_EMAIL_ADDRESS with the service
account's email address.
You can define multiple security schemes in your API config, but
each definition must have a different issuer . If you have
created separate service accounts for each calling service, you can
create a security definition for each service account, for example:
components :
securitySchemes :
service-1 :
type : oauth2
flows :
implicit :
authorizationUrl : ""
scopes : {}
x-google-auth :
issuer : "service-1@example-project-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
jwksUri : https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/service-1@example-project-12345. iam.gserviceaccount.com
jwtLocations :
- header : Authorization
valuePrefix : "Bearer "
service-2 :
type : oauth2
flows :
implicit :
authorizationUrl : ""
scopes : {}
x-google-auth :
issuer : "service-2@example-project-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
jwksUri : "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/service-2@example-project-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
Optionally, add audiences to the securitySchemes section. If
you don't add audiences , API Gateway requires that the
"aud" (audience) claim in the JWT is in the format
https:// SERVICE_NAME , where
SERVICE_NAME is the name of your API Gateway
service, which you have configured in the servers.url field of your OpenAPI
document.
Add a security section at either the top level of the file (not
indented or nested) to apply to the entire API, or at the method level
to apply to a specific method. If you use security sections at both the API
level and at the method level, the method-level settings override the
API-level settings.
security :
- SCHEME_NAME : []
Replace SCHEME_NAME with the name that you
used in the securitySchemes section.
If you have more than one definition in the securitySchemes section,
add them in the security section, for example:
security :
- service-1 : []
- service-2 : []
Deploy your updated API config . Before API Gateway forwards a request to your API, API Gateway
verifies:
The signature of the JWT by using the public key, which is located at the URI
specified in the jwksUri field in your API config.
That the "iss" (issuer) claim in the JWT matches the value specified in the
issuer field.
That the "aud" (audience) claim in the JWT contains your
API Gateway service name or matches one of the values that you
specified in the audiences field.
That the token isn't expired by using the "exp" (expiration time) claim.
Make an authenticated request to an API Gateway API
To make an authenticated request, the calling service sends a JWT signed by the
service account that you specified in the API config. The calling service
must:
Create a JWT and sign it with the service account's private key.
Send the signed JWT in a request to the API.
The following sample code demonstrates this process for select languages.
To make an authenticated request in other languages, reference
jwt.io
for a list of supported libraries.
In the calling service, add the following function and pass it the following
parameters:
Java
saKeyfile : The full path to the service account's private key
file.
saEmail : The service account's email address.
audience : If you added the x-google-audiences field
to your API config, set audience to one of the values that
you specified for x-google-audiences . Otherwise, set
audience to https:// SERVICE_NAME , where
SERVICE_NAME is your API Gateway
service name.
expiryLength : The JWT expiration time, in seconds.
Python
sa_keyfile : The full path to the service account's private key
file.
sa_email : The service account's email address.
audience : If you added the x-google-audiences field
to your API config, set audience to one of the values that
you specified for x-google-audiences . Otherwise, set
audience to https:// SERVICE_NAME , where
SERVICE_NAME is your API Gateway
service name.
expiry_length : The JWT expiration time, in seconds.
Go
saKeyfile : The full path to the service account's private key
file.
saEmail : The service account's email address.
audience : If you added the x-google-audiences field
to your API config, set audience to one of the values that
you specified for x-google-audiences . Otherwise, set
audience to https:// SERVICE_NAME , where
SERVICE_NAME is your API Gateway
service name.
expiryLength : The JWT expiration time, in seconds.
The function creates a JWT, signs it by using the private key file, and
returns the signed JWT.

In the calling service, add the following function to send the signed JWT
in the Authorization: Bearer header in the request to the API:
Java
/**

public static String makeJwtRequest ( final String signedJwt , final URL url )
throws IOException , ProtocolException {
HttpURLConnection con = ( HttpURLConnection ) url . openConnection ();
con . setRequestMethod ( "GET" );

String line ;
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder ();
while (( line = buffReader . readLine ()) != null ) {
result . append ( line );
}

return result . toString ();
}
Python
def make_jwt_request ( signed_jwt , url = "https://your-endpoint.com" ):
"""Makes an authorized request to the endpoint"""
headers = {
"Authorization" : "Bearer {} " . format ( signed_jwt . decode ( "utf-8" )),
"content-type" : "application/json" ,
}
response = requests . get ( url , headers = headers )
print ( response . status_code , response . content )
response . raise_for_status ()
Go
// makeJWTRequest sends an authorized request to your deployed endpoint.
func makeJWTRequest ( signedJWT , url string ) ( string , error ) {
client := & http . Client {
Timeout : 10 * time . Second ,
}
req , err := http . NewRequest ( "GET" , url , nil )
if err != nil {
return "" , fmt . Errorf ( "failed to create HTTP request: %w" , err )
}
req . Header . Add ( "Authorization" , "Bearer " + signedJWT )
req . Header . Add ( "content-type" , "application/json" )
response , err := client . Do ( req )
if err != nil {
return "" , fmt . Errorf ( "HTTP request failed: %w" , err )
}
defer response . Body . Close ()
responseData , err := io . ReadAll ( response . Body )
if err != nil {
return "" , fmt . Errorf ( "failed to parse HTTP response: %w" , err )
}
return string ( responseData ), nil
}
When you send a request by using a JWT, for security reasons, we
recommend that you put the authentication token in the Authorization: Bearer
header. For example:
curl --request POST \
--header "Authorization : Bearer TOKEN " \
" GATEWAY_URL /hello"
Here, GATEWAY_URL and TOKEN should be replaced with your
deployed gateway URL and authentication token, respectively.
Receive authenticated results in your API
API Gateway usually forwards all headers it receives. However, it overrides the
original Authorization header when the backend address is specified by
x-google-backend in the API config.
API Gateway will send the authentication result in the X-Apigateway-Api-Userinfo
to the backend API. It is recommended to use this header instead of the original
Authorization header. This header is base64url encoded and contains
the JWT payload.
