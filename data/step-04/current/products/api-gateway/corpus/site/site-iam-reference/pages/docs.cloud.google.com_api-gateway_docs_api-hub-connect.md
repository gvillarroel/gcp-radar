Connect API Gateway with API hub
This page describes how to connect API Gateway with Apigee API hub to
allow you to view your APIs and centralize your API management.
Overview
As an API Gateway administrator, to connect API Gateway with API hub you'll need
to do the following steps:
Provision API hub
Attach your API Gateway project to API hub
Before you begin: Grant roles
Ensure that you have the appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to connect API Gateway with API hub.
In the project where you will provision API hub:
Grant roles for provisioning, as described in Before you begin in the API hub provisioning steps.
In the API Gateway projects that you will attach to API hub:
Grant the Cloud API hub Runtime Project Attachment Editor ( roles/apihub.runTimeProjectAttachmentsEditor ) role to your principal account.
To attach your API Gateway project to API hub using the Google Cloud console,
grant the Browser ( roles/browser ) role to your principal account.
Provision API hub
Before you can connect API Gateway with API hub, you'll need to provision API hub in your host project. A host project is a Google Cloud project in your Google Cloud organization that you designate as the consumer project for all API hub resources. A single API hub instance can be provisioned per host project.
To provide centralized discovery of APIs across all of your API Gateways, we recommend using one dedicated host project for the API hub instance and attaching multiple API Gateway projects, referred to as runtime projects , to the API hub instance.
If an instance of API hub is already provisioned in your Google Cloud organization or folder, we recommend that you skip this step and attach your API Gateway project to the existing API hub instance .
To provision API hub in your host project, do one of the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API hub page, select the Google Cloud project to use as the host project, and click Set up API hub .
You can access this page from API Gateway pages as follows:
Click Get started in the API hub banner at the top of any of the API Gateway pages
Click Get started with API hub at the top of the APIs page
Then follow the detailed provisioning steps described in Provision API hub in the Cloud console .
Use the command line or Terraform .
Note that during provisioning:
You choose the hosting location where you want to persist the API Gateway API metadata.
You can choose to encrypt the data stored in API hub. However, the API Gateway service is automatically CMEK-compliant .
Attach your API Gateway project to API hub
Attach your API Gateway project to API hub.
Google Cloud console
To attach an API Gateway project to API hub, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API hub page.
Go to API hub
Click settings Settings from the left navigation menu to open the Settings page.
Go to the Project associations tab.
If your API Gateway project is not in the list of attached runtime projects, do the following:
Click Attach runtime project . This displays the Select a resource pane.
Click the Google Cloud project where API Gateway is provisioned.
In the Project association settings pane, select API Gateway and any other API assets you want to automatically import.
Click Save .
If your API Gateway project is already on the list of attached runtime projects, do the following:
Click Edit settings in the row associated with the API Gateway runtime project.
In the Project association settings pane, select API Gateway and any other API assets you want to automatically import.
Click Save .
To enable real-time data ingestion, API hub creates an API Gateway plugin instance for the attached runtime project when you select to import API Gateway assets. You can view this plugin instance in the Associated plugins column on the Project associations page.
REST
To attach your API Gateway project to API hub, use the Create runtime project attachments and Create plugin instance APIs.
For example, to create the runtime project attachment:
curl "https://apihub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ HUB_PROJECT_ID /locations/ HUB_LOCATION /runtimeProjectAttachments?runtimeProjectAttachmentId= RUNTIME_PROJECT_ID " \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"runtimeProject":"projects/ RUNTIME_PROJECT_ID "}'
Replace the following:
HUB_PROJECT_ID : The name of your API hub host project. The host project was selected
when API hub was provisioned.
HUB_LOCATION : The location of the host project. The location was chosen when API
hub was provisioned.
RUNTIME_PROJECT_ID : The name of your API Gateway runtime project.
If successful, an RuntimeProjectAttachment JSON object is returned.
Then, to create the API Gateway plugin instance:
curl "https://apihub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ HUB_PROJECT_ID /locations/ HUB_LOCATION /plugins/ PLUGIN_TYPE /instances" \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"displayName": "API Gateway Plugin Instance",
"sourceProjectId": " RUNTIME_PROJECT_ID ",
"actions": [
{
"actionId": "sync-metadata"
}
]
}'
Replace the following:
HUB_PROJECT_ID : The name of your API hub host project. The host project was selected
when API hub was provisioned.
HUB_LOCATION : The location of the host project. The location was chosen when API
hub was provisioned.
PLUGIN_TYPE : Type of plugin. Set to system-api-gateway .
RUNTIME_PROJECT_ID : The name of your API Gateway runtime project.
If successful, an Operation JSON object is returned.
