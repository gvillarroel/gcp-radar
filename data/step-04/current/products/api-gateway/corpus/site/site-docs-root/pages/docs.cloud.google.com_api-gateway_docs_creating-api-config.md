Create an API config
This page describes how to create an API config to deploy on API Gateway.
Before you begin
Before you create an API config, do the following:
Prepare your development environment as described in Configure your development environment .
Create an API definition as an OpenAPI spec .
If using the Google Cloud CLI, optionally create an API . If the API doesn't exist, then creating the API config creates it.
Note : When using the Google Cloud console, the API and API config are created when deploying the API to a gateway .
API config ID requirements
Many of the gcloud CLI commands shown require you to specify the ID of the API config, in the form: CONFIG_ID .
API Gateway enforces the following requirements for the API config ID:
Must have a maximum length of 63 characters.
Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, or dashes.
Must not start with a dash.
Must not contain an underscore.
Create an API config
Create an API config by uploading your API definition.
Note: API Gateway supports creation of API definitions as OpenAPI specs for all available backend services. API Gateway also supports the use of gRPC service definitions and configurations for gRPC services on Cloud Run.
If the managedService in your API definition is set to an ESPv2 Beta service, make sure that the host field (OpenAPI 2.0) or server.url field (OpenAPI 3.x) is set to an
x-google-endpoint extension in your API config.
To create an API config:
Google Cloud console
Create an API config when you deploy an API to a gateway .
Google Cloud CLI
Upload your API definition to create an API config. When you upload the API definition, you are required to specify the name of the API.
If the API does not already exist in API Gateway then this command also creates it.
Note : If you want to use OpenAPI 3.x, make sure to update the gcloud CLI components before you create an API config to avoid errors when uploading your API definition.
Change to the directory containing your API definition.
For more on creating the OpenAPI spec for your API definition, see OpenAPI overview and Quickstart: Secure traffic to a service with the gcloud CLI.
For more on creating a gRPC service definition and configuration for your API definition, see Configure a gRPC service and Get started with API Gateway and Cloud Run for gRPC .
Validate the project ID returned from the following command to make sure that the service isn't created in the wrong project.
gcloud config list project
If you need to change the default project, run the following command and replace PROJECT_ID with the Google Cloud project ID in which you want to create the service:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
View help for the api-configs create command:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create --help
Run the following command to create the API config:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create CONFIG_ID \
--api= API_ID --openapi-spec= API_DEFINITION \
--project= PROJECT_ID --backend-auth-service-account= SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
where:
CONFIG_ID specifies the ID of the new API config.
API_ID specifies the ID of the API Gateway API associated with this API config. If the API does not already exist then this command creates it.
API_DEFINITION specifies the name of the OpenAPI spec containing the API definition.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL specifies the service account used to sign tokens for backends with authentication configured. See Configure the service account used to create API configs for more details.
As it is creating the API and API config, API Gateway outputs information to the terminal. This operation may take several minutes to complete as the API config is propagated to downstream systems. Creation of a complex API config could take up to ten minutes to complete successfully. While a config is being created, don't attempt to create another config for the same API. Only one config may be created for any API at a time.
On successful completion, you can use the following command to view details about the new API config:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs describe CONFIG_ID \
--api= API_ID
This command returns the following:
createTime: '2020-02-04T18:33:11.882707149Z'
displayName: CONFIG_ID
gatewayConfig:
backendConfig:
googleServiceAccount: 1111111@developer.gserviceaccount.com
labels: ''
name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/apis/ API_ID /configs/ CONFIG_ID
serviceRollout:
rolloutId: 2020-02-04r2
state: ACTIVE
updateTime: '2020-02-04T18:33:12.219323647Z'
Enable the API using the managed service name of the API. You can find this value in the Managed Service column for your API on the APIs landing page:
gcloud services enable MANAGED_SERVICE_NAME .apigateway. PROJECT_ID .cloud.goog
You only have to run this command once when you create the API. If you later modify the API, you don't have to rerun the command.
The gcloud CLI takes many options, including those described in the Google Cloud CLI Reference . In addition, for API Gateway, you can set the following options when creating an API config:
--async : Return control to the terminal immediately, without waiting for the operation to complete.
--display-name= NAME : Specifies the display name of the API config, meaning the name shown in the UI. Don't use spaces in the name. Use hyphens and underscores instead. The default value is CONFIG_ID .
--labels= KEY1 = VALUE1 , KEY2 = VALUE2 ,... : Specifies labels associated with the API config.
For example:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create CONFIG_ID \
--api= API_ID --openapi-spec= API_DEFINITION \
--backend-auth-service-account= SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
--async --display-name=MyConfig --labels=a=1,b=2
You can see the labels in the output of the describe command shown, or in the list command by including the --format option:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs list \
--api= API_ID --format="table(name, labels)"
List API configs
List all of the API Gateways deployed in your Google Cloud project.
Google Cloud console
To list API configs for a specific API in a project:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API Gateway page.
Go to API Gateway
Click the required API.
Click the Configs tab.
You will see the list of available API configs on the page.
Google Cloud CLI
To list API configs for a specific project:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs list
This command returns the following:
NAME DISPLAY_NAME ROLLOUT_ID STATE CREATE_TIME
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/apis/ API_ID /configs/ CONFIG_ID CONFIG_ID 2020-02-04r0 ACTIVE 2020-02-04T16:18:02.369859863Z
To list API configs for a specific API in a project:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs list --api= API_ID
Use the API and config IDs to obtain detailed information about the API config:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs describe CONFIG_ID \
--api= API_ID
Update an API config
You cannot modify an existing API config other than to update its labels and its display name.
Note: Every time you upload an API definition, API Gateway creates a new API config.
To update an API definition:
Update the OpenAPI spec containing the API definition.
Upload the API definition to create a new API config.
Use the same command to create the new API config as you used to create the initial API config,
as shown in Create an API config .
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API Gateway page.
Go to API Gateway
Click the required API.
Click the Configs tab.
Click the required API config.
Click edit Edit .
Edit Display Name or Labels .
Click Save .
Google Cloud CLI
Use the following `gcloud` to update an existing API config:
--display-name
--update-labels
--clear-labels
--remove-labels
For example:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs update CONFIG_ID \
--api= API_ID \
--update-labels=a=1,b=2
Use the following command to view all update options:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs update --help
Delete an API config
Warning: If you deployed the API config
to a gateway, the API config may not be deleted until the gateway is no longer
using that API config.
Before you delete an API config that is in use, you must either:
Deploy a different API config to the gateway.
Delete the gateway.
See Deploy an API to a gateway for more.
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API Gateway page.
Go to API Gateway
Click the required API.
Click the Configs tab.
Click More more_vert and then click Delete to delete the chosen API config.
Google Cloud CLI
Use the following gcloud CLIcommand to delete an existing API config:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs delete CONFIG_ID --api= API_ID --project= PROJECT_ID
