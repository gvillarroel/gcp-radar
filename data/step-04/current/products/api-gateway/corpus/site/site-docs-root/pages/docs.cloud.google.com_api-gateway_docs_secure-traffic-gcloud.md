Quickstart: Secure traffic to a service with the gcloud CLI
This page shows you how to deploy an API on API Gateway to secure traffic to a backend service.
Use the following steps to deploy a new API to access a backend service on Cloud Run functions using the Google Cloud CLI. This quickstart also describes how to use an API key to protect your backend from unauthorized access.
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Dashboard page and select or create a Google Cloud project.
Go to Dashboard
Note: If you don't plan to keep the resources you create in this quickstart, create a new project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Confirm that billing is enabled for your project.
Enable billing
Verify that the Google Cloud CLI is downloaded and installed on your machine.
Download the gcloud CLI
Update gcloud components:
gcloud components update
Set the default project. Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project ID.
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Enable required services
API Gateway requires that you enable the following Google Cloud services:
Name
Service name
API Gateway API
apigateway.googleapis.com
Service Management API
servicemanagement.googleapis.com
Service Control API
servicecontrol.googleapis.com
To enable required services:
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the APIs & Services > API Library page.
Go to API Library
On the API Library page, enter the required API name into the search bar.
In the search results, select the API page.
On the API page, click Enable .
Repeat these steps for each of the services listed in the preceding table.
Google Cloud CLI
Use the following commands to enable the services:
gcloud services enable apigateway.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable servicemanagement.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable servicecontrol.googleapis.com
For more information about the gcloud services, see
gcloud services .
Deploy an API backend
API Gateway sits in front of a deployed backend service and handles all incoming requests. In this quickstart, API Gateway routes incoming calls to a Cloud Run function backend named helloGET that contains the Node.js function shown below.
const functions = require ( '@google-cloud/functions-framework' );
// Register an HTTP function with the Functions Framework that will be executed
// when you make an HTTP request to the deployed function 's endpoint.
functions . http ( 'helloGET' , ( req , res ) => {
res . send ( 'Hello World!' );
});
Note: The actual name of the function and backend in the example varies according to the language you choose when completing the Cloud Run functions tutorial. This tutorial uses the Node.js example.
Follow the steps in Quickstart: Deploy a Cloud Run function using the Google Cloud CLI to download the sample Cloud Run functions code and deploy the Cloud Run function backend service. Your administrator will need to grant additional roles to your account and and to the Cloud Build service account, as described in this quick start.
Copy the Service URL that is displayed when the Cloud Run function is deployed. You'll need it when creating the API config in a subsequent step.
Create an API
Now you are ready to create your API on API Gateway.
Enter the following command, where:
API_ID specifies the name of your API. See API ID requirements for API naming guidelines.
gcloud api-gateway apis create API_ID
For example:
gcloud api-gateway apis create my-api
On successful completion, you can use the following command to view details about the new API:
gcloud api-gateway apis describe API_ID
For example:
gcloud api-gateway apis describe my-api
This command returns the following:
createTime: '2020-02-29T21:52:20.297426875Z'
displayName: my-api
managedService: my-api-123abc456def1.apigateway.my-project.cloud.goog
name: projects/ my-project /locations/global/apis/ my-api
state: ACTIVE
updateTime: '2020-02-29T21:52:20.647923711Z'
Copy the value of the managedService property. This value is used to enable your API
in a subsequent step.
Create an API config
Before API Gateway can be used to manage traffic to your deployed API backend, it needs an API config.
You can create an API config using an OpenAPI description that contains specialized annotations to define the chosen API Gateway behavior. For more details on supported OpenAPI extensions, see the following:
OpenAPI 2.0 extensions in API Gateway
OpenAPI 3.x extensions in API Gateway
The OpenAPI description used for this quickstart contains routing instructions to our Cloud Run function backend:
OpenAPI 2.0
# openapi-functions.yaml
swagger : '2.0'

pathTranslation : APPEND_PATH_TO_ADDRESS
protocol : "http/1.1"
# Apply the backend configuration by referencing it by name. Set at the root so this applies to all operations unless overridden.
x-google-backend : functions_backend
paths :
/hello :
get :
summary : Greet a user
operationId : hello
responses :
'200' :
description : A successful response
content :
application/json :
schema :
type : string
To upload this OpenAPI description and create an API config using the gcloud CLI:
From the command line, create a new file named openapi-functions.yaml .
Copy and paste the contents of the OpenAPI description into the newly created file.
Edit the file as follows:
In the title field, replace API_ID with the name of your API and replace optional-string with a brief description of your choosing. The value of this field is used when minting API keys that grant access to this API.
In the address field, replace SERVICE_URL with the URL where the Cloud Run function backend service is running, copied in a previous step.
Enter the following command, where:
CONFIG_ID specifies the name of your API config.
API_ID specifies the name of your API.
API_DEFINITION specifies the filename of the OpenAPI spec.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL specifies the service account used to sign tokens for backends with authentication configured. For more information, see Configure a service account .
Note : The service account used to create an API config for a Cloud Run functions backend must have the cloudfunctions.invoker role assigned.
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create CONFIG_ID \
--api= API_ID --openapi-spec= API_DEFINITION \
--backend-auth-service-account= SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
For example:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create my-config \
--api= my-api --openapi-spec=openapi2-functions.yaml \
--backend-auth-service-account= 0000000000000-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
This operation may take several minutes to complete as the API config is propagated to
downstream systems. Creating a complex API config could take up to ten minutes to complete successfully.
Note: If you run this command and receive an error in the form FAILED_PRECONDITION: Service Account ... does not exist , see Configure a service account to confirm that a service account is enabled for your project. Note: Only one API config at a time may be created for a given API. Wait
until the config creation finishes before attempting to create a new
config for the same API.
After the API config is created, you can view its details by running this command:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs describe CONFIG_ID \
--api= API_ID
For example:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs describe my-config \
--api= my-api
The output shows your API config details, including name and state, as shown in the following example:
createTime: '2020-02-07T18:17:01.839180746Z'
displayName: my-config
gatewayConfig:
backendConfig:
googleServiceAccount: 0000000000000-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
name: projects/my-project/locations/global/apis/my-api/configs/my-config
serviceRollout:
rolloutId: 2020-02-07r0
state: ACTIVE
updateTime: '2020-02-07T18:17:02.173778118Z'
Create a gateway
Now deploy the API config on a gateway. Deploying an API config on a gateway defines an external URL that API clients can use to access your API.
Run the following command to deploy the API config you just created to API Gateway:
gcloud api-gateway gateways create GATEWAY_ID \
--api= API_ID --api-config= CONFIG_ID \
--location= GCP_REGION
where:
GATEWAY_ID specifies the name of the gateway.
API_ID specifies the name of the API Gateway API associated with this gateway.
CONFIG_ID specifies the name of the API config deployed to the gateway.
GCP_REGION is the Google Cloud region for the deployed gateway.
Note: Allowed values are:
asia-northeast1
australia-southeast1
europe-west1
europe-west2
us-east1
us-east4
us-central1
us-west2
us-west3
us-west4
PROJECT_ID specifies the name of your Google Cloud project.
For example:
gcloud api-gateway gateways create my-gateway \
--api= my-api --api-config= my-config \
--location= us-central1
On successful completion, use the following command to view details about the gateway:
gcloud api-gateway gateways describe GATEWAY_ID \
--location= GCP_REGION
For example:
gcloud api-gateway gateways describe my-gateway \
--location= us-central1
This command returns the following:
apiConfig : projects /my-project/locations/global/apis/my-api/configs/ my - config
createTime : '2020-02-05T13:44:12.997862831Z'
defaultHostname : my - gateway - a12bcd345e67f89g0h . uc . gateway . dev
displayName : my - gateway
name : projects /my-project/locations/us-central1/gateways/ my - gateway
serviceAccount :
email : 0000000000000 - compute @ developer.gserviceaccount.com
state : ACTIVE
updateTime : '2020-02-05T13:45:00.844705087Z'
Note the value of the defaultHostname property. This is the hostname portion of the gateway URL you use to test your deployment in the next step.
Test your API deployment
Now you can send requests to your API using the URL generated upon deployment of your gateway.
Enter the following curl command, where:
DEFAULT_HOSTNAME specifies the hostname portion of your deployed gateway URL, copied in a previous step.
hello is the path specified in your API config.
curl https:// DEFAULT_HOSTNAME /hello
For example:
curl https:// my-gateway-a12bcd345e67f89g0h.uc.gateway.dev /hello
The output is:
Hello World!
You have successfully created and deployed an API Gateway!
Secure access using an API key
To secure access to your API backend with an API key, do the following:
Create an API key associated with your project.
Create and deploy a new API config to secure API access using API keys.
Test your API key
See also Restricting API access with API keys .
Create an API key
If you don't already have an API key associated with the Google Cloud project you are using in this quickstart, add one as described in Create an API Key .
Copy the returned key string and keep it secure. This is the key value that you will use when testing your API key.
Create and deploy a new API config
To create and deploy a new API config that secures API access using API keys:
Enable your service. Enter the following command, where:
MANAGED_SERVICE_NAME specifies the name of the managed service created when you deployed the API. This can be viewed in the Managed Service property listed with the gcloud api-gateway apis describe command.
PROJECT_ID specifies the name of your Google Cloud project.
gcloud services enable MANAGED_SERVICE_NAME .apigateway. PROJECT_ID .cloud.goog
For example:
gcloud services enable my-api - 123abc456def1 .apigateway. my-project .cloud.goog
Modify the OpenAPI description used to create your API config to include instructions to enforce an API key validation security policy on all traffic. Add the security type and securityDefinitions as shown:
OpenAPI 2.0

content :
application/json :
schema :
type : string
The securitySchemes configures your API to require an API key
passed as a query parameter named key when requesting access to
all paths defined in the spec.
Create a new API config with the modified OpenAPI spec using the following command:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create NEW_CONFIG_ID \
--api= API_ID --openapi-spec= NEW_API_DEFINITION \
--backend-auth-service-account= SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
For example:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create my-config-key \
--api= my-api --openapi-spec= openapi2-functions.yaml \
--project= my-project --backend-auth-service-account= 0000000000000compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Run the following command to update your existing gateway with the new API config:
gcloud api-gateway gateways update GATEWAY_ID \
--api= API_ID --api-config= NEW_CONFIG_ID \
--location= GCP_REGION
For example:
gcloud api-gateway gateways update my-gateway \
--api= my-api --api-config= my-config-key \
--location= us-central1
Test your API key
Once you have created and deployed the modified API, try making a request to it.
Enter the following curl command, where:
DEFAULT_HOSTNAME specifies the hostname portion of your deployed gateway URL, copied in a previous step.
hello is the path specified in your API config.
curl https:// DEFAULT_HOSTNAME /hello
For example:
curl https:// my-gateway-a12bcd345e67f89g0h.uc.gateway.dev /hello
This should result in the following error:
UNAUTHENTICATED : Method doesn ' t allow unregistered callers ( callers without established identity ). Please use API Key or other form of API consumer identity to call this API .
Now, enter the following curl command where:
DEFAULT_HOSTNAME specifies the hostname portion of your deployed gateway URL, copied in a previous step.
hello is the path specified in your API config.
API_KEY specifies the API key you created in the previous step.
curl https:// DEFAULT_HOSTNAME /hello?key= API_KEY
Now you should see Hello World! in the response from your API.
Congratulations! You have successfully protected your API backend with an API Gateway. Now you can start onboarding new API clients by generating additional API keys.
