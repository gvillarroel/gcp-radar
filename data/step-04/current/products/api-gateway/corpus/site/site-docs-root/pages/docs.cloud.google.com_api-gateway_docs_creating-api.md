Create an API
This page describes how to create an API.
Prerequisites
Before you can create an API, do the following:
Prepare your development environment as described in Configure the development environment .
API ID requirements
Many of the gcloud commands shown require you to specify the ID of the API, in the form: API_ID .
API Gateway enforces the following requirements for the API ID:
Must have a maximum length of 63 characters.
Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, or dashes.
Must not start with a dash.
Must not contain an underscore.
Create an API
Create an API.
Google Cloud console
Create and deploy an API, as described in Deploy an API to a gateway .
Google Cloud CLI
To create an API, review the following sections:
Steps to create an API
Google Cloud CLI options
Domain-scoped projects
Steps to create an API
Validate the project ID returned from the following command to make sure that the service isn't created in the wrong project.
gcloud config list project
If you need to change the default project, run the following command and replace PROJECT_ID with the Google Cloud project ID in which you want to create the service:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
If your project ID contains a colon ( : ), see Domain-scoped projects for additional details about creating an API in your project.
View help for the apis create command:
gcloud api-gateway apis create --help
Run the following command to create the API:
gcloud api-gateway apis create API_ID
where:
API_ID specifies the ID of the new API. See API ID requirements for API naming guidelines.
As it is creating the API, API Gateway outputs information to the terminal.
On successful completion, you can use the following command to view details about the new API:
gcloud api-gateway apis describe API_ID
This command returns the following:
createTime: '2020-02-29T21:52:20.297426875Z'
displayName: API_ID
managedService: MANAGED_SERVICE_NAME .apigateway. PROJECT_ID .cloud.goog
name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/apis/ API_ID
state: ACTIVE
updateTime: '2020-02-29T21:52:20.647923711Z'
Google Cloud CLI options
The Google Cloud CLI takes many options, including those described in the
gcloud Reference . In addition,
for API Gateway, you can set the following options when creating an API:
--async : Return control to the terminal immediately, without
waiting for the operation to complete.
--display-name= NAME : Specifies the display name
of the API, meaning the name shown in the UI. Do not use spaces in the name.
Use hyphens and underscores instead. The default value is API_ID .
--labels= KEY1 = VALUE1 , KEY2 = VALUE2 ,... :
Specifies labels associated with the API config.
--managed-service : Specifies a pre-existing managed service
for the API. See also Domain-scoped projects
Domain-scoped projects
If your project is scoped to your domain, the project ID includes the name of
the domain followed by a colon ( : ), for example,
example.com:my-project . You must provide a valid managed service
when creating an API in a domain-scoped project.
If using gcloud , provide the managed service name using the
--managed-service flag, as described in
Google Cloud CLI options .
Note: Scoping projects to a domain is a legacy feature. You cannot create new
domain-scoped projects.
List APIs
List all APIs in a project.
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API Gateway page.
Go to API Gateway
Google Cloud CLI
gcloud api-gateway apis list
This command returns output in the form:
NAME DISPLAY_NAME MANAGED_SERVICE STATE
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/apis/ API_ID API_ID MANAGED_SERVICE_NAME .apigateway. PROJECT_ID .cloud.goog ACTIVE
Use the API ID to obtain detailed information about the API:
gcloud api-gateway apis describe API_ID
Update an API
After creation, you can update the labels and display name of an existing API.
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API Gateway page.
Go to API Gateway
Click the required API.
Click the Details tab.
Click edit Edit .
Edit Display Name or Labels , then click Save .
Google Cloud CLI
Use the following gcloud options to update an existing API:
--display-name
--update-labels
--clear-labels
--remove-labels
For example:
gcloud api-gateway apis update API_ID \
--update-labels=a=1,b=2
Use the following command to view all update options:
gcloud api-gateway apis update --help
Delete an API
Note: If you deployed an API config
to a gateway, then deleting the API causes the gateway to stop serving traffic.
To delete an API, you must:
Delete the API Gateways associated with the API and its API configs.
Delete the API configs associated with the API.
Delete the API.
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API Gateway page.
Go to API Gateway
Click the API chosen to be deleted.
Click the Configs tab.
Select the API Config(s) and click More
more_vert and then click Delete .
Click arrow_back to return to
the API Gateway homepage.
Click More more_vert and then click Delete to
delete the chosen API.
Google Cloud CLI
Determine the list of API Gateways associated with the API:
gcloud api-gateway gateways list --filter='apiConfig:"projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/apis/ API_ID "'
Delete each API config associated with the API:
gcloud api-gateway api-configs delete CONFIG_ID --api= API_ID
Delete the API:
gcloud api-gateway apis delete API_ID
What's next
Create an API config
