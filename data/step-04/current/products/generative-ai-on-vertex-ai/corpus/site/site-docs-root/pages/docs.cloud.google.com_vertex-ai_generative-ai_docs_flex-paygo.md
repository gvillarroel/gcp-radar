Flex pay-as-you-go (Flex PayGo), is a
cost-effective option for accessing Gemini models for non-critical
workloads that can tolerate longer response times and higher throttling.
Flex PayGo offers a 50% discount compared to Standard PayGo.
When to use Flex PayGo
Flex PayGo is ideal for the synchronous, latency-tolerant, and
non-critical tasks that aren't time-sensitive. The following are example use
cases:
Offline analysis of text, documents, image, audio and video files
Evaluation of model qualities
Data annotation and labeling
Document translation
Building a product catalog
Note: For large workloads that can tolerate 24-hour turnaround times and process
hundreds of billions of tokens daily, we recommend Batch inference with
Gemini for improved
throughput and success rate.
Supported models and locations
The following preview
Gemini models support Flex PayGo in the global
endpoint only. Flex PayGo doesn't support regional or
multi-regional endpoints.
gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview
gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview
gemini-3.1-pro-preview
gemini-3-flash-preview
gemini-3-pro-image-preview
Request payload limit
Flex PayGo requests have a total payload size limit of 20 MB for requests where the payload is included directly in the request body. To process larger files, provide a Cloud Storage URI in your request.
Use Flex PayGo
To send requests to the Gemini API using Flex PayGo,
you must include the X-Vertex-AI-LLM-Shared-Request-Type header in your
request. You can use Flex PayGo in two ways:
Use Provisioned Throughput quota (if available) and then use Flex PayGo.
Use only Flex PayGo.
Note that requests that use Flex PayGo have longer expected latency than
Standard PayGo.
You can set the request timeout to a maximum of 30 minutes.
Use Flex PayGo while using Provisioned Throughput as default
To utilize any available Provisioned Throughput quota before using
Flex PayGo, include the header
X-Vertex-AI-LLM-Shared-Request-Type: flex in your requests, as shown in the
following samples.
Python
Install
pip install --upgrade google-genai
To learn more, see the
SDK reference documentation .
Set environment variables to use the Gen AI SDK with Vertex AI:
# Replace the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` values
# with appropriate values for your project.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT = GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION = global
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI = True
Initialize your GenAI client to use Flex PayGo. After performing
this step, you won't need to make further adjustments to your code to interact
with the Gemini API using Flex PayGo on the same
client.
You can override the default timeout by using the timeout
parameter. The timeout is specified in milliseconds.
from google import genai
from google.genai.types import HttpOptions
client = genai . Client (
vertexai = True , project = 'your_project_id' , location = 'global' ,
http_options = HttpOptions (
api_version = "v1" ,
headers = {
"X-Vertex-AI-LLM-Shared-Request-Type" : "flex"
},
# timeout = 600000 # Timeout in milliseconds
)
)
REST
After you
set up your environment ,
you can use REST to test a text prompt. The following sample sends a request to the publisher
model endpoint.
Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements.
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID .
MODEL_ID : The model ID of the model
for which you want to initialize Flex PayGo. For a list of models that support
Flex PayGo, see Model versions .
PROMPT_TEXT :
The text instructions to include in the prompt.
JSON.
You can override the default timeout by setting the
X-Server-Timeout header. The timeout is specified in seconds.
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-H "X-Server-Timeout: 600" \
-H "X-Vertex-AI-LLM-Shared-Request-Type: flex" \
"https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/publishers/google/models/ MODEL_ID :generateContent" -d \
$'{
"contents": {
"role": "model",
"parts": { "text": " PROMPT_TEXT " }
}
}'
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following.
{
"candidates" : [
{
"content" : {
"role" : "model" ,
"parts" : [
{
"text" : "Response to sample request."
}
]
} ,
"finishReason" : "STOP"
}
] ,
"usageMetadata" : {
"promptTokenCount" : 3 ,
"candidatesTokenCount" : 900 ,
"totalTokenCount" : 1957 ,
"trafficType" : "ON_DEMAND_FLEX" ,
"thoughtsTokenCount" : 1054
}
}
Note the following in the URL for this sample:
Use the
generateContent
method to request that the response is returned after it's fully generated.
To reduce the perception of latency to a human audience, stream the response as it's being
generated by using the
streamGenerateContent
method.
The multimodal model ID is located at the end of the URL before the method
(for example, gemini-2.0-flash ). This sample might support other
models as well.
When you use a regional API endpoint (for example, us-central1 ), the region from the endpoint URL determines where the request is processed. Any conflicting location in the resource path is ignored.
Use only Flex PayGo
To use only Flex PayGo, include the headers
X-Vertex-AI-LLM-Request-Type: shared and
X-Vertex-AI-LLM-Shared-Request-Type: flex in your requests, as shown in the
following samples.
Python
Install
pip install --upgrade google-genai
To learn more, see the
SDK reference documentation .
Set environment variables to use the Gen AI SDK with Vertex AI:
# Replace the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` values
# with appropriate values for your project.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT = GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION = global
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI = True
Initialize your GenAI client to use Flex PayGo. After performing
this step, you won't need to make further adjustments to your code to interact
with the Gemini API using Flex PayGo on the same
client.
You can override the default timeout by using the timeout
parameter. The timeout is specified in milliseconds.
from google import genai
from google.genai.types import HttpOptions
client = genai . Client (
vertexai = True , project = 'your_project_id' , location = 'global' ,
http_options = HttpOptions (
api_version = "v1" ,
headers = {
"X-Vertex-AI-LLM-Request-Type" : "shared" ,
"X-Vertex-AI-LLM-Shared-Request-Type" : "flex"
},
# timeout = 600000 # Timeout in milliseconds
)
)
REST
Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

$'{
"contents": {
"role": "model",
"parts": { "text": " PROMPT_TEXT " }
}
}'
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following.
{
"candidates" : [

Verify Flex PayGo usage
You can verify whether a request utilized Flex PayGo from the
traffic type in the response, as shown in the following examples.
Python
You can verify whether
Flex PayGo was utilized for a request from the traffic_type
field in the response. If your request was processed using
Flex PayGo, the traffic_type field is set to
ON_DEMAND_FLEX .
sdk_http_response = HttpResponse (
headers =
) candidates = [ Candidate (
avg_logprobs =- 0.539712212302468 ,
content = Content (
parts = [
Part (
text = """Response to sample request.
