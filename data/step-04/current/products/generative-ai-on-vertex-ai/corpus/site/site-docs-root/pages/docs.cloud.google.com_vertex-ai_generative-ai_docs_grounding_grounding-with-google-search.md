Grounding with Google Search
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to ground Gemini responses using
results from Google's search engine, which uses publicly-available web data. Also,
Search Suggestions are explained, which are included in
your responses.
Grounding with Google Search
If you want to connect your model with world knowledge, a wide possible range of
topics, or up-to-date information on the Internet, then use Grounding with Google Search.
Important: If you receive
Google Search Suggestions with a response, that response is a Grounded
Result subject to the Grounding with Google Search terms in the
Service Terms section of the
Service Specific Terms. To use Google Search Suggestions, see
Use Google Search Suggestions .
Note for web publishers: Grounding with Google Search on
Vertex AI does not use web pages for grounding that have disallowed
Google-Extended. Web publishers can manage inclusion in Google-Extended with a
robots.txt file .
To learn more about model grounding in Vertex AI,
see the Grounding overview .
Supported models
This section lists the models that support grounding with
Search.
Supported languages
For a list of supported languages, see
Languages .
Using Grounding with Google Search
Use the following instructions to ground a model with publicly available web
data.
Considerations
To use Grounding with Google Search, you must enable
Google Search Suggestions. For more information, see
Use Google Search suggestions .
For ideal results, use a temperature of 1.0 . To learn more about setting
this configuration, see the Gemini API request
body
from the model reference.
Grounding with Google Search has a limit of one million queries per day. If
you require more queries, contact Google Cloud support for assistance.
Important: If you receive Search Suggestions with a
response, that response is a grounded result subject to the Grounding with
Search terms in the Service Terms section of the Service
Specific Terms . For more
information about using Google Search Suggestions, see Use
Search Suggestions .
Search results can be customized for a specific geographic location of the end
user by using the latitude and longitude coordinates. For more information, see
the Grounding API.
Console
To use Grounding with Google Search with the Vertex AI Studio, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Vertex AI Studio page.
Go to
Vertex AI Studio
Click the Freeform tab.
In the side panel, click the Ground model responses toggle.
Click Customize and set Grounding with Google Search as the source.
Enter your prompt in the text box and click Submit .

You should receive a successful status code (2xx) and an empty response.
Display requirements
When using Google Image Search with Grounding with Google Search, you must comply with the following
conditions:
Source attribution : you must provide a link to the webpage that
containing the source image (the "containing page, "not the image file
itself) in a manner that the user will recognize as a link.
Direct navigation : if you also choose to display the source images, you
must provide a direct, single-click path from the source images to its
containing source webpage. Any other implementation that delays or abstracts
the end users' access to the source webpages, including but not limited to
any multi-click path or the use of an intermediate image viewer, is not
permitted.
Response
For grounded responses using image search, the API provides clear attribution
and metadata to link its output to verified sources. The groundingMetadata
object includes the following fields:
imageSearchQueries : the specific query used by the model for visual
context (also known as the "image search").
groundingChunks : contains the source information for retrieved
results. For image sources, these are returned as redirect URLs using a new
image chunk type. The chunk includes the following:
url : the web page URL for attribution (also known as the "landing
page").
image_url : the direct image URL.
groundingSupports : provides specific mappings that link the generated
content to its relevant citation source in the chunks.
searchEntryPoint : includes the Google Search chip that contains
compliant HTML and CSS to render Google Search Suggestions.
Understand your response
If your model prompt successfully uses Grounding with Google Search from the
Vertex AI Studio or from the API, then the responses include metadata with
source links (web URLs). However, there are several reasons this metadata might
not be provided, and the prompt response won't be grounded. These reasons
include low source relevance or incomplete information within the model's
response.
Inline citations
Inline citations use the structured grounding_metadata returned by the API to
link specific segments of generated text to verifiable sources.
This capability supports all grounding methods including Search,
Google Maps, and Vertex AI Search, providing the precise source details
required to display accurate, interactive citations within your application.

Grounding support
Displaying grounding support is required, because it aids you in validating
responses from the publishers and adds avenues for further learning.
Grounding support for responses from web sources should be shown
both inline and in aggregate. For example, see the following image as a
suggestion on how to do this.
Use of alternative search engine options
When using Grounding with Google Search a Customer Application can:
Offer alternative search engine options,
Make other search engines the default option,
Display their own or third-party search suggestions or search results as long
as: any non-Google results must be displayed separately from Google's Grounded
Results and Search Suggestions, and shown in a way that does not confuse
users or suggest they are from Google.
Benefits
The following complex prompts and workflows that require planning, reasoning,
and thinking can be done when you use Grounding with Google Search as a tool:
You can ground to help ensure responses are based on the latest and most
accurate information.
You can retrieve artifacts from the web to do analysis.
You can find relevant images, videos, or other media to assist in multimodal
reasoning or task generation.
You can perform coding, technical troubleshooting, and other specialized
tasks.
You can find region-specific information, or assist in translating content
accurately.
You can find relevant websites for browsing.
Use Google Search Suggestions
When you use Grounding with Google Search, and you receive
Search Suggestions in your response, you must display the
Search Suggestions in production and in your applications.
Specifically, you must display the search queries that are included in the
grounded response's metadata. The response includes:
"content" : LLM-generated response.
"webSearchQueries" : The queries to be used for
Search Suggestions.
For example, in the following code snippet, Gemini responds to a
Search grounded prompt, which is asking about a type of
tropical plant.
"predictions" : [
{
"content" : "Monstera is a type of vine that thrives in bright indirect light…" ,
"groundingMetadata" : {
"webSearchQueries" : [ "What's a monstera?" ],
}
}
]
You can take this output, and display it by using Search
Suggestions.
Requirements for Search Suggestions
The following is required for Search Suggestions:
Requirement
Description
Do
While complying with the display
requirements , the Search Suggestion is displayed exactly as provided without any changes.
When you interact with the Search Suggestion, you are
taken directly to the Search results page (SRP).
Don't
Include any screens or additional steps between the user's tap and the display
of the SRP.
Display any other search results or suggestions next to the
Search Suggestion or the associated grounded LLM
response.
Display requirements
The following are the display requirements:
Display the Search Suggestion exactly as provided, and
don't make any modifications to colors, fonts, or appearance. Ensure the
Search Suggestion renders as specified in the following
mocks such as light and dark mode:
Whenever a grounded response is shown, its corresponding
Search Suggestion should remain visible.
For branding, you must strictly follow Google's guidelines for third-party use
of Google brand features at the Welcome to our Brand Resource
Center .
When you use grounding with Search,
Search Suggestion chips display. The field that contains
the Search Suggestions chips must be the same width as
the grounded response from the LLM.
Behavior on tap
When a user taps the chip, they are taken directly to a
Search results page (SRP) for the search term displayed in
the chip. The SRP can open either within your in-application browser or in a
separate browser application. It's important to not minimize, remove, or
obstruct the SRP's display in any way. The following animated mockup illustrates
the tap-to-SRP interaction.
Code to implement a Search Suggestion
When you use the API to ground a response to search, the model response provides
compliant HTML and CSS styling in the renderedContent field, which you
implement to display Search Suggestions in your
application.
Note: The provided HTML and CSS provided in the API response automatically
adapts to your device settings which display in either light or dark mode
based on your your preference indicated by @media(prefers-color-scheme) .
Also, Search Suggestions were referred to as Search Entry
Points before. Although you might encounter references to Search Entry
Points in some API fields, both terms refer to the current Search Suggestions
that you receive in your API response.
Billing changes with Gemini 3
When you are using Grounding with Google Search on Gemini 3 models, the billing occurs for
each search query that is generated by Gemini and sent to
Search. A single prompt might lead to one or more search
queries.
Example
This example shows you a sample user prompt and search queries that might be
charged.
User prompt: Tell me about the life of Albert Einstein.
Gemini might generate these search queries:
Albert Einstein birth and early life education
Albert Einstein theory of relativity
Albert Einstein life in the US
In this example, these three search queries are charged.
