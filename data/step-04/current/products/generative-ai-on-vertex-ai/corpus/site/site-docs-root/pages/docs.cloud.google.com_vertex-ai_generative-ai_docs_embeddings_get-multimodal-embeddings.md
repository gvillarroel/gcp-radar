Get multimodal embeddings
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
To see an example of multimodal embeddings,
run the "Intro to multimodal embeddings" notebook in one of the following
environments:
Open in Colab
|
Open in Colab Enterprise
|
Open
in Vertex AI Workbench
|
View on GitHub
The multimodal embeddings model generates multi-dimensional vectors based on the
input you provide, which can include a combination of image, text, and video
data. The embedding vectors can then be used for subsequent tasks like image
classification or video content moderation.
The image embedding vector and text embedding vector are in the same semantic
space with the same dimensionality. Consequently, these vectors can be used
interchangeably for use cases like searching image by text, or searching video
by image.
For text-only embedding use cases, we recommend using the Vertex AI
text-embeddings API instead. For example, the text-embeddings API might be
better for text-based semantic search, clustering, long-form document analysis,
and other text retrieval or question-answering use cases. For more information,
see Get text embeddings .
Supported models
You can get multimodal embeddings by using the following models:
gemini-embedding-2-preview
multimodalembedding@001
Best practices
Consider the following input aspects when using the multimodal embeddings model:
Text in images - The model can distinguish text in images, similar to
optical character recognition (OCR). If you need to distinguish between a
description of the image content and the text within an image, consider
using prompt engineering to specify your target content.
For example: instead of just "cat", specify "picture of a cat" or
"the text 'cat'", depending on your use case.
the text 'cat'
picture of a cat

Embedding similarities - The dot product of embeddings isn't a
calibrated probability. The dot product is a similarity metric and might have
different score distributions for different use cases. Consequently, avoid
using a fixed value threshold to measure quality. Instead, use ranking
approaches for retrieval, or use sigmoid for classification.
Specify task instructions to improve performance
Note: You cannot use the task_type field to specify an embedding task for the gemini-embedding-2-preview model. Instead, include the task as an instruction in your prompt, as detailed in this section. For more information on task types for prior models, see task types .
You can use embeddings for a wide range of tasks, from classification to document search. Specifying the right task instruction helps optimize the embeddings for the intended relationships, maximizing accuracy and efficiency.
The following tables show examples of how to format queries and documents for symmetric and asymmetric use cases using the gemini-embedding-2-preview model.
Retrieval use cases (Asymmetric format)
Use case
Query structure
Document structure
Search query
task: search result | query: {content}
title: {title} | text: {content} If there is no title, use title: none .
Question answering
task: question answering | query: {content}
title: {title} | text: {content}
Fact checking
task: fact checking | query: {content}
title: {title} | text: {content}
Code retrieval
task: code retrieval | query: {content}
title: {title} | text: {content}
Note: In asymmetric retrieval use cases, use the document structure for the content you want to embed and retrieve.
Single-input use cases (Symmetric format)
Use case
Input structure
Classification
task: classification | query: {content}
Clustering
task: clustering | query: {content}
Semantic similarity
task: sentence similarity | query: {content} Do not use this for search or retrieval. It is intended for semantic textual similarity.
Example usage in Python
# Generate embedding for a search query
def prepare_query ( query ):
return f "task: search result | query: { query } "
# Generate embedding for a search document
def prepare_document ( content , title = None ):
if title is None :
title = "none"
return f "title: { title } | text: { content } "
# Generate embedding for classification
def prepare_classification_input ( content ):
return f "task: classification | query: { content } "
API usage
API limits
The following limits apply when you use the gemini-embedding-2-preview model.
Note : gemini-embedding-2-preview is a preview model. Do not use this model on mission critical or production systems.
Limit
Value and description
Text, image, and document data
Input token limit
8192 tokens Inputs longer than 8192 tokens are automatically truncated. Tokens are counted per modality: Image: 258 tokens per image
Video: 66 tokens per frame
Audio: 25 tokens per second
Document (PDF): rendered as an image, so 258 tokens per page. Additional text tokens are extracted if OCR is enabled.
Output dimensionality
3072 (default, configurable using the output_dimensionality parameter)
Image limits
6 images per request The model also resizes images to 768 x 768 pixels internally.
Image formats
JPEG, PNG
Document limits
1 file per request, up to 6 pages We strongly recommend 1 page per PDF for the best quality.
Document formats
PDF
Video and audio data
Video limits
1 video per request, up to 120 frames The 120-second limit is based on the default 1 FPS setting. Duration varies when you set different FPS: Duration = 120 / FPS. Videos are resized to 768 x 768 pixels internally. By default, audio extraction is disabled for video. When the audio track extraction option is enabled, the duration is subject to the maximum audio duration of 80 seconds.
Video formats
Container: MOV, MP4. Codec: AV1, H264, H265, VP9.
Audio limits
80 seconds per request Audio support is optimized for speech. Ambient sound and music might not perform at the highest quality.
Audio formats
MP3, WAV
Use multimodalembedding@001
The following limits apply when you use the multimodalembedding@001 model for
text and image embeddings:
Limit
Value and description
Text and image data
Maximum number of API requests per minute per project
120-600 depending on region
Maximum text length
32 tokens (~32 words) The maximum text length is 32 tokens (approximately 32 words). If the input exceeds 32 tokens, the model internally shortens the input to this length.
Language
English
Image formats
BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG
Image size
Base64-encoded images: 20 MB (when transcoded to PNG) Cloud Storage images: 20MB (original file format) The maximum image size accepted is 20 MB. To avoid increased network latency, use smaller images. Additionally, the model resizes images to 512 x 512 pixel resolution. Consequently, you don't need to provide higher resolution images.
Video data
Audio supported
N/A - The model doesn't consider audio content when generating video embeddings
Video formats
AVI, FLV, MKV, MOV, MP4, MPEG, MPG, WEBM, and WMV
Maximum video length (Cloud Storage)
No limit. However, only 2 minutes of content can be analyzed at a time.

request with your justification for a sustained quota adjustment.
Specify lower-dimension embeddings
Depending on the model being used, an embedding request returns either a 1408
float vector or a 3072 float vector. You can specify lower dimension
embeddings for text and image data to optimize for latency and storage, or
quality. Lower dimension embeddings lower storage needs and provide lower latency
for subsequent embedding tasks (such as search or recommendation).
Higher-dimension embeddings offer greater accuracy for these tasks, but with
higher storage needs and higher latency.
The following table illustrates the default and available lower dimensions
available for each model:
Model
Default dimensions (highest)
Supported dimensions (range)
Recommended lower dimensions
gemini-embedding-2-preview
3072
128 to 3072
128, 768 or 1536
multimodalembedding@001
1408
128 to 1408
128, 256, or 512
Use the following samples to generate embeddings with lower dimensions:
REST
Lower dimensions can be accessed by adding the parameters.dimension field.
The parameter accepts any of the dimension values available for the model.
For example, you can specify 128 , 256 , 512 or 1408 when using
the multimodalembedding@001 model. The response includes the
embedding of the specified dimension.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION : Your project's region. For example,
us-central1 , europe-west2 , or asia-northeast3 . For a list
of available regions, see
Generative AI on Vertex AI locations . When a regional API endpoint is used, the region from the endpoint's URL determines where the request is processed, and this LOCATION in the resource path is ignored if it conflicts.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID .
IMAGE_URI : The Cloud Storage URI of the target image to get embeddings for.
For example, gs://my-bucket/embeddings/supermarket-img.png .
You can also provide the image as a
base64-encoded byte string:
[...]
"image": {
"bytesBase64Encoded": " B64_ENCODED_IMAGE "
}
[...]
TEXT : The target text to get embeddings for. For example,
a cat .
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION : The number of embedding dimensions. Lower values offer decreased
latency when using these embeddings for subsequent tasks, while higher values offer better
accuracy. Available values: 128 ,
256 , 512 , and 1408 (default).

Get video, image, or text embeddings ( multimodalembedding@001 )
When sending an embedding request you can specify an input video alone, or
you can specify a combination of video, image, and text data.
Video embedding modes
There are three modes you can use with video embeddings: Essential, Standard, or
Plus. The mode corresponds to the density of the embeddings generated, which can
be specified by the interval_sec config in the request. For each video
interval with interval_sec length, an embedding is generated. The minimal
video interval length is 4 seconds. Interval lengths greater than 120 seconds
might negatively affect the quality of the generated embeddings.
Pricing for video embedding depends on the mode you use. For more information,
see pricing .
The following table summarizes the three modes you can use for video embeddings:
Mode
Maximum number of embeddings per minute
Video embedding interval (minimum value)
Essential
4
15 This corresponds to: intervalSec >= 15
Standard
8
8 This corresponds to: 8 <= intervalSec < 15
Plus
15
4 This corresponds to: 4 <= intervalSec < 8
Video embeddings best practices
Consider the following when you send video embedding requests:
To generate a single embedding for the first two minutes of an input video
of any length, use the following videoSegmentConfig setting:
request.json :
// other request body content
"videoSegmentConfig" : {
"intervalSec" : 120
}
// other request body content
To generate embedding for a video with a length greater than two minutes,
you can send multiple requests that specify the start and end times in the
videoSegmentConfig :
request1.json :
// other request body content
"videoSegmentConfig" : {
"startOffsetSec" : 0 ,
"endOffsetSec" : 120
}
// other request body content
request2.json :
// other request body content
"videoSegmentConfig" : {
"startOffsetSec" : 120 ,
"endOffsetSec" : 240
}
// other request body content
Get video embeddings
Use the following sample to get embeddings for video content alone.
REST
For more information about multimodalembedding@001 model requests, see the
multimodalembedding@001 model API reference .
The following example uses a video located in Cloud Storage. You can
also use the video.bytesBase64Encoded field to provide a
base64-encoded string representation of the
video.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION : Your project's region. For example,
us-central1 , europe-west2 , or asia-northeast3 . For a list
of available regions, see
Generative AI on Vertex AI locations . When a regional API endpoint is used, the region from the endpoint's URL determines where the request is processed, and this LOCATION in the resource path is ignored if it conflicts.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID .
VIDEO_URI : The Cloud Storage URI of the target video to get embeddings for.
For example, gs://my-bucket/embeddings/supermarket-video.mp4 .
You can also provide the video as a
base64-encoded byte string:
[...]
"video": {
"bytesBase64Encoded": " B64_ENCODED_VIDEO "
}
[...]
videoSegmentConfig ( START_SECOND , END_SECOND ,
INTERVAL_SECONDS ). Optional. The specific video segments (in seconds) the embeddings
are generated for.
The value you set for videoSegmentConfig.intervalSec affects
the pricing tier you are charged at. For more information, see
the video embedding modes section and
pricing page.
For example:
[...]
"videoSegmentConfig": {
"startOffsetSec": 10,
"endOffsetSec": 60,
"intervalSec": 10
}
[...]
Using this config specifies video data from 10 seconds to 60 seconds and generates embeddings
for the following 10 second video intervals: [10, 20), [20, 30), [30, 40), [40, 50), [50, 60).
This video interval ( "intervalSec": 10 ) falls in the
Standard video embedding mode , and the user
is charged at the Standard mode pricing rate .
If you omit videoSegmentConfig , the service uses the following default values:
"videoSegmentConfig": { "startOffsetSec": 0, "endOffsetSec": 120, "intervalSec": 16 } .
This video interval ( "intervalSec": 16 ) falls in the
Essential video embedding mode , and the user
is charged at the Essential mode pricing rate .
HTTP method and URL:
POST https:// LOCATION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /publishers/google/models/multimodalembedding@001:predict
Request JSON body:
{
"instances": [
{
"video": {
"gcsUri": " VIDEO_URI ",
"videoSegmentConfig": {
"startOffsetSec": START_SECOND ,
"endOffsetSec": END_SECOND ,
"intervalSec": INTERVAL_SECONDS
}
}
}
]
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https:// LOCATION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /publishers/google/models/multimodalembedding@001:predict"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https:// LOCATION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /publishers/google/models/multimodalembedding@001:predict" | Select-Object -Expand Content

Get image, text, and video embeddings
Use the following sample to get embeddings for video, text, and image content.
REST
For more information about multimodalembedding@001 model requests, see the
multimodalembedding@001 model API reference .
The following example uses image, text, and video data. You can use any
combination of these data types in your request body.
Additionally, this
sample uses a video located in Cloud Storage. You can
also use the video.bytesBase64Encoded field to provide a
base64-encoded string representation of the
video.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION : Your project's region. For example,
us-central1 , europe-west2 , or asia-northeast3 . For a list
of available regions, see
Generative AI on Vertex AI locations . When a regional API endpoint is used, the region from the endpoint's URL determines where the request is processed, and this LOCATION in the resource path is ignored if it conflicts.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID .
TEXT : The target text to get embeddings for. For example,

IMAGE_URI : The Cloud Storage URI of the target image to get embeddings for.
For example, gs://my-bucket/embeddings/supermarket-img.png .
You can also provide the image as a
base64-encoded byte string:
[...]
"image": {
"bytesBase64Encoded": " B64_ENCODED_IMAGE "
}
[...]
VIDEO_URI : The Cloud Storage URI of the target video to get embeddings for.
For example, gs://my-bucket/embeddings/supermarket-video.mp4 .
You can also provide the video as a
base64-encoded byte string:
[...]
"video": {
"bytesBase64Encoded": " B64_ENCODED_VIDEO "
}
[...]
videoSegmentConfig ( START_SECOND , END_SECOND ,
INTERVAL_SECONDS ). Optional. The specific video segments (in seconds) the embeddings
are generated for.
The value you set for videoSegmentConfig.intervalSec affects
the pricing tier you are charged at. For more information, see
the video embedding modes section and
pricing page.
For example:
[...]
"videoSegmentConfig": {
"startOffsetSec": 10,
"endOffsetSec": 60,
"intervalSec": 10
}
[...]
Using this config specifies video data from 10 seconds to 60 seconds and generates embeddings
for the following 10 second video intervals: [10, 20), [20, 30), [30, 40), [40, 50), [50, 60).
This video interval ( "intervalSec": 10 ) falls in the
Standard video embedding mode , and the user
is charged at the Standard mode pricing rate .
If you omit videoSegmentConfig , the service uses the following default values:
"videoSegmentConfig": { "startOffsetSec": 0, "endOffsetSec": 120, "intervalSec": 16 } .
This video interval ( "intervalSec": 16 ) falls in the
Essential video embedding mode , and the user
is charged at the Essential mode pricing rate .

Use gemini-embedding-2-preview
The gemini-embedding-2-preview model accepts interleaved inputs across image, text, document, audio, and video modalities.
Dimensions
When using the gemini-embedding-2-preview model, you can specify lower dimensions using the output_dimensionality parameter in EmbedContentConfig .
The following example returns a 128 -dimensional vector. Note that non-default dimension embeddings are not normalized. Normalized embeddings produce more accurate semantic similarity by comparing vector direction, not magnitude. For other dimensions (including 768 and 1536 ), you need to normalize the embeddings.
import numpy as np
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
# Initialize the client.
client = genai . Client ( vertexai = True , project = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID" , location = "us-central1" )
content = types . Content (
parts = [
types . Part . from_uri (
file_uri = "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/audio/Chirp-3-Docs-Dive.mp3" ,
mime_type = "audio/mpeg" ,
),
],
)
response = client . models . embed_content (
model = "gemini-embedding-2-preview" ,
contents = [ content ],
config = types . EmbedContentConfig ( output_dimensionality = 128 ),
)
# Normalize the output embedding.
embedding_values_np = np . array ( response . embeddings [ 0 ] . values )
normed_embedding = embedding_values_np / np . linalg . norm ( embedding_values_np )
print ( f "Normed embedding length: { len ( normed_embedding ) } " )
print ( f "Norm of normed embedding: { np . linalg . norm ( normed_embedding ) : .6f } " ) # Should be very close to 1

Video parameters
The default video sampling rate is 1 frame per second (FPS). Additional parameters can be added using video_metadata :
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
# Initialize the client.
client = genai . Client ( vertexai = True , project = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID" , location = "us-central1" )
content = types . Content (
parts = [
types . Part (
file_data = types . FileData (
file_uri = "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/video/pixel8.mp4" ,
mime_type = "video/mp4" ,
),
video_metadata = types . VideoMetadata (
fps = 0.5 ,
start_offset = "10s" ,
end_offset = "20s" ,
),
),
]
)
response = client . models . embed_content (
model = "gemini-embedding-2-preview" ,
contents = [ content ]
)
print ( response . embeddings [ 0 ] . values )
Advanced options
There are extra options in EmbedContentConfig .
output_dimensionality - int
Reduce the dimensionality for the output embedding.
document_ocr - bool
Enable OCR for document input. Note: this option is not yet available in the Vertex AI SDK.
audio_track_extraction - bool
Extract the audio track from video input and interleave it with video frames for embeddings. Note: this option is not yet available in the Vertex AI SDK.
