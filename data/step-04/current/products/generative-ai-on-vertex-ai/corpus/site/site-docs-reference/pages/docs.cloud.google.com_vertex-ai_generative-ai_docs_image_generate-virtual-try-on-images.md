Generate Virtual Try-On Images
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Virtual Try-On lets you generate images of people to virtually try-on clothing
products. You provide an image of a person and an image of a clothing product,
and then Virtual Try-On generates an image of the person wearing that
product.
The following models support generating virtual try-on images:
virtual-try-on-001

Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Vertex AI API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .

Set up authentication for your environment.
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Python
To use the Python samples on this page in a local development environment, install and
initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with
your user credentials.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Set up ADC for a local development environment
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
REST
To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the
credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using REST
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
Generate images
Python
Install
pip install --upgrade google-genai
To learn more, see the
SDK reference documentation .
Set environment variables to use the Gen AI SDK with Vertex AI:
# Replace the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` values
# with appropriate values for your project.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT = GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION = global
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI = True
from google import genai
from google.genai.types import RecontextImageSource , ProductImage
client = genai . Client ()
# TODO(developer): Update and un-comment below line
# output_file = "output-image.png"
image = client . models . recontext_image (
model = "virtual-try-on-001" ,
source = RecontextImageSource (
person_image = Image . from_file ( location = "test_resources/man.png" ),
product_images = [
ProductImage ( product_image = Image . from_file ( location = "test_resources/sweater.jpg" ))
],
),
)
image . generated_images [ 0 ] . image . save ( output_file )
print ( f "Created output image using { len ( image . generated_images [ 0 ] . image . image_bytes ) } bytes" )
# Example response:
# Created output image using 1234567 bytes
REST
For more information about the Virtual Try-On API, see the following:
Method:
endpoints.predict
VirtualTryOnModelInstance
VirtualTryOnModelParams
VirtualTryOnModelResult
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
REGION : The region that your project is located in. For more
information about supported regions, see
Generative AI on Vertex AI
locations .
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID .
BASE64_PERSON_IMAGE : The Base64-encoded image of the person
image.
BASE64_PRODUCT_IMAGE : The Base64-encoded image of the product
image.
IMAGE_COUNT : The number of images to generate. The accepted range
of values is 1 to 4 .
GCS_OUTPUT_PATH : The Cloud Storage path to store
the virtual try-on output to.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https:// REGION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /publishers/google/models/virtual-try-on-001:predict
Request JSON body:
{
"instances": [
{
"personImage": {
"image": {
"bytesBase64Encoded": " BASE64_PERSON_IMAGE "
}
},
"productImages": [
{
"image": {
"bytesBase64Encoded": " BASE64_PRODUCT_IMAGE "

}
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https:// REGION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /publishers/google/models/virtual-try-on-001:predict"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https:// REGION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /publishers/google/models/virtual-try-on-001:predict" | Select-Object -Expand Content
The request returns image objects. In this example, two image objects are
returned, with two prediction objects as base64-encoded images.
{
"predictions": [
{
"mimeType": "image/png",
"bytesBase64Encoded": " BASE64_IMG_BYTES "
},
{
