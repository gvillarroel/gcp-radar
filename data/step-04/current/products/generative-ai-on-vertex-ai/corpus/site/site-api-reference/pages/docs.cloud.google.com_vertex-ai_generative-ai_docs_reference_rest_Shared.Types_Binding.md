Binding
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Associates members , or principals, with a role .
Fields
role
string
role that is assigned to the list of members , or principals. For example, roles/viewer , roles/editor , or roles/owner .
For an overview of the IAM roles and permissions, see the IAM documentation . For a list of the available pre-defined roles, see here .
members[]
string
Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. members can have the following values:
allUsers : A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account.
allAuthenticatedUsers : A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation.
user:{emailid} : An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@example.com .
serviceAccount:{emailid} : An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com .
serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}] : An identifier for a Kubernetes service account . For example, my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa] .
group:{emailid} : An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com .
domain:{domain} : The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com .
principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{poolId}/subject/{subject_attribute_value} : A single identity in a workforce identity pool.
principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{poolId}/group/{groupId} : All workforce identities in a group.
principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{poolId}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attributeValue} : All workforce identities with a specific attribute value.
principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{poolId}/* : All identities in a workforce identity pool.
principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{projectNumber}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{poolId}/subject/{subject_attribute_value} : A single identity in a workload identity pool.
principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{projectNumber}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{poolId}/group/{groupId} : A workload identity pool group.
principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{projectNumber}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{poolId}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attributeValue} : All identities in a workload identity pool with a certain attribute.
principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{projectNumber}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{poolId}/* : All identities in a workload identity pool.
deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid} : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901 . If the user is recovered, this value reverts to user:{emailid} and the recovered user retains the role in the binding.
deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid} : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901 . If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to serviceAccount:{emailid} and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding.
deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid} : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901 . If the group is recovered, this value reverts to group:{emailid} and the recovered group retains the role in the binding.
deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{poolId}/subject/{subject_attribute_value} : Deleted single identity in a workforce identity pool. For example, deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/my-pool-id/subject/my-subject-attribute-value .
condition
object ( Expr )
The condition that is associated with this binding.
If the condition evaluates to true , then this binding applies to the current request.
If the condition evaluates to false , then this binding does not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this binding.
To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation .
JSON representation
{
"role" : string ,
"members" : [
string
] ,
"condition" : {
object ( Expr )
}
}
Expr
Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec .
Example (Comparison):
title: "Summary size limit"
description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars"
expression: "document.summary.size() < 100"
Example (Equality):
title: "Requestor is owner"
description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner"
expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email"
Example (Logic):
title: "Public documents"
description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible"
expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'"
Example (data Manipulation):
title: "Notification string"
description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp."
expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)"
The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information.
Fields
expression
string
Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.
title
string
Optional. title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.
description
string
Optional. description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
location
string
Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
