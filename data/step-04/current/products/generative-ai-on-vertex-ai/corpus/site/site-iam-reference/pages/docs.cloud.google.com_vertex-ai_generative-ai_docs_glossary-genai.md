agent
In the context of generative AI, an agent is software that autonomously plans and executes a series of actions in pursuit of a goal, potentially in novel situations. Agents can be used in various applications, such as natural language processing, machine learning, and robotics. For example, an LLM agent uses a language model to evaluate the environment and choose an action to help it achieve its goal. LLM agents can be used to generate text, translate languages, and answer questions.
API endpoint
API Endpoints is a service config aspect that specifies the network addresses, also known as service endpoints (for example, aiplatform.googleapis.com).
Application Default Credentials (ADC)
The Application Default Credentials (ADC) provide a simple way to get authorization credentials for use in calling Google APIs. They are best suited for cases when the call needs to have the same identity and authorization level for the application independent of the user. This is the recommended approach to authorize calls to Google Cloud APIs, particularly when you're building an application that is deployed to Google App Engine (GAE) or Compute Engine virtual machines. For more information, see How Application Default Credentials works .
Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)
The Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) service is a high scale, low latency solution, to find similar vectors (or more specifically, "embeddings") for a large corpus. For more information, see How to use Vector Search for semantic matching .
artifact
An artifact is a discrete entity or piece of data produced and consumed by a machine learning workflow. Examples of artifacts include datasets, models, input files, and training logs.
Artifact Registry
Artifact Registry is a universal artifact management service. It is the recommended service for managing containers and other artifacts on Google Cloud. For more information, see Artifact Registry .
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial intelligence (or AI) is the study and design of machines that appear to be "intelligent", meaning one which mimics human or intellectual functions such as mechanical movement, reasoning or problem solving. One of the most popular subfields of AI is machine learning, which uses a statistical and data-driven approach to create AI. However, some people use these two terms interchangeably.
Augmented Reality (AR)
Blending rendered digital content with real-world content, either via a display such as in a phone or as an overlay to the world seen through optics like glasses. The digital content should be tracked to the movement of the camera or glasses (depending on how the scene is rendered) so that it appears as if it is part of the real world.
authentication
The process of verifying the identity of a client (which might be a user or another process) for the purposes of gaining access to a secured system. A client that has proven its identity is said to be authenticated. For more information, see Authentication methods at Google .
Automatic side-by-side (AutoSxS)
Automatic side-by-side (AutoSxS) is a model-assisted evaluation tool that compares two large language models (LLMs) side by side. It can be used to evaluate the performance of either generative AI models in Vertex AI Model Registry or pregenerated inferences. AutoSxS uses an autorater to decide which model gives the better response to a prompt. AutoSxS is available on demand and evaluates language models with comparable performance to human raters.
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR,Speech to Text)
Automatic transcription of spoken language (speech) to text.
AutoML
Machine learning algorithms that "learn to learn" through black-box optimization. For more information, see ML Glossary .
autorater
An autorater is a language model that evaluates the quality of model responses given an original inference prompt. It's used in the AutoSxS pipeline to compare the inferences of two models and determine which model performed the best. For more information, see The autorater .
baseline
A model used as a reference point for comparing how well another model (typically, a more complex one) is performing. For example, a logistic regression model might serve as a good baseline for a deep model. For a particular problem, the baseline helps model developers quantify the minimal expected performance that a new model must achieve for the new model to be useful. For more information, see Baseline and target datasets .
batch
The set of examples used in one training iteration. The batch size determines the number of examples in a batch.
batch size
The number of examples in a batch. For example, the batch size of SGD is 1, while the batch size of a mini-batch is usually between 10 and 1000. Batch size is usually fixed during training and inference; however, TensorFlow does permit dynamic batch sizes.
batch inference
Batch inference takes a group of inference requests and outputs the results in one file. For more information, see Overview of getting inferences on Vertex AI .
bias
1. Stereotyping, prejudice or favoritism towards some things, people, or groups over others. These biases can affect collection and interpretation of data, the design of a system, and how users interact with a system. 2. Systematic error introduced by a sampling or reporting procedure.
bidrectional
A term used to describe a system that evaluates the text that both precedes and follows a target section of text. In contrast, a unidirectional system only evaluates the text that precedes a target section of text.
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
BERT is a method of pre-training language representations, meaning that we train a general-purpose "language understanding" model on a large text corpus (like Wikipedia), and then use that model for downstream NLP tasks that we care about (like question answering). BERT outperforms previous methods because it is the first unsupervised, deeply bidirectional system for pre-training NLP.
Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)
A popular measure for evaluating the quality of a machine-translation algorithm by comparing its output to that of one or more human translations.
boosting
In model training: Boosting can refer to data augmentation techniques used to increase the size and diversity of training datasets. This is done by transforming existing examples to create additional, varied examples, which can improve model performance, especially when the original dataset is limited.
bounding box
A bounding box for an object in the video frame can be specified in either of two ways (i) Using 2 vertices consisting of a set of x,y coordinates if they are diagonally opposite points of the rectangle. For example: x_relative_min, y_relative_min,,,x_relative_max,y_relative_max,, (ii) Use all 4 vertices. For more information, see Prepare video data .
bucket
Top-level folder for Cloud Storage. Bucket names must be unique across all users of Cloud Storage. Buckets contain files. For more information, see Product overview of Cloud Storage .
Chain-of-Thought
In generative AI, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that encourages the large language model (LLM) to explicitly detail its reasoning process before arriving at a conclusion. This involves prompting the model to show the intermediate steps it takes to solve a problem, rather than just providing the final answer. This method can significantly improve the LLM's performance on complex reasoning tasks.
chat
The contents of a back-and-forth dialogue with an ML system, typically a large language model. The previous interaction in a chat (what you typed and how the large language model responded) becomes the context for subsequent parts of the chat. A chatbot is an application of a large language model.
checkpoint
Data that captures the state of a model's parameters either during training or after training is completed. For example, during training, you can: 1. Stop training, perhaps intentionally or perhaps as the result of certain errors. 2. Capture the checkpoint. 3. Later, reload the checkpoint, possibly on different hardware. 4. Restart training. Within Gemini, a checkpoint refers to a specific version of a Gemini model trained on a specific dataset.
classification model
A model whose inference is a class. For example, the following are all classification models: A model that predicts an input sentence's language (French? Spanish? Italian?). A model that predicts tree species (Maple? Oak? Baobab?). A model that predicts the positive or negative class for a particular medical condition.
classification metrics
Supported classification metrics in the Vertex AI SDK for Python are confusion matrix and ROC curve.
Cloud TPU
A specialized hardware accelerator designed to speed up machine learning workloads on Google Cloud.
clustering
In the context of generative AI, clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their characteristics. This is achieved by defining a similarity measure (or metric) to compare data points, and grouping those with high similarity into the same cluster. In generative AI applications, this might involve clustering embeddings (numerical representations of text, images, or other data) to perform tasks like search, classification, or outlier detection. For example, customer segmentation can be achieved by clustering customer data to identify groups with similar behaviors or characteristics. For more information, see What is clustering? .
container image
A container image is a package that includes the component's executable code and a definition of the environment that the code runs in. For more information, see Vertex AI serverless training overview .
context
A context is used to group artifacts and executions together under a single, queryable, and typed category. Contexts can be used to represent sets of metadata. An example of a Context would be a run of a machine learning pipeline.
context cache
A context cache in Vertex AI is a large amount of data that can be used in multiple requests to a Gemini model. The cached content is stored in the region where the request to create the cache is made. It can be any MIME type supported by Gemini multimodal models, such as text, audio, or video. For more information, see Context caching overview .
context window
The number of tokens a model can process in a given prompt. The larger the context window, the more information the model can use to provide coherent and consistent responses to the prompt.
Customer-managed encryption keys (cmek)
Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) are integrations that allow customers to encrypt data in existing Google services using a key they manage in Cloud KMS (also known as Storky). The key in Cloud KMS is the key encryption key protecting their data. For more information, see Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) .
consumer VPC network
A consumer VPC network is a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that privately accesses a service hosted in another VPC (known as the producer VPC). For more information, see Private Service Connect .
data analysis
Obtaining an understanding of data by considering samples, measurement, and visualization. Data analysis can be particularly useful when a dataset is first received, before one builds the first model. It is also crucial in understanding experiments and debugging problems with the system.
data augmentation
Artificially boosting the range and number of training examples by transforming existing examples to create additional examples. For example, suppose images are one of your features, but your dataset doesn't contain enough image examples for the model to learn useful associations. Ideally, you'd add enough labeled images to your dataset to enable your model to train properly. If that's not possible, data augmentation can rotate, stretch, and reflect each image to produce many variants of the original picture, possibly yielding enough labeled data to enable excellent training.
DataFrame
A popular pandas data type for representing datasets in memory. A DataFrame is analogous to a table or a spreadsheet. Each column of a DataFrame has a name (a header), and each row is identified by a unique number. Each column in a DataFrame is structured like a 2D array, except that each column can be assigned its own data type.
data indexing
In the context of generative AI, data indexing is the process of structuring and organizing a knowledge base to optimize search and retrieval. This involves creating an index, often called a corpus, which allows for efficient searching of the data. The process is separate from corpus creation, and the indexed data can be used to enrich the context of large language models (LLMs), reducing hallucinations and improving the accuracy of responses. For example, in a website context, data indexing might involve adding metadata like datePublished and dateModified to improve search functionality. Different methods exist for indexing data, including using vector search for similarity search in applications like retrieving relevant information for LLMs at query time. For more information, see RAG Engine overview .
data ingestion
Data ingestion is the process of extracting data from various sources and integrating it into a central location for further processing and analysis. In the context of generative AI, data ingestion involves extracting information from different data sources, such as clinical forms, patient records, or unstructured text, to train and fine-tune generative AI models. The ingested data is typically processed and transformed to ensure its quality and consistency before it is used to train the generative AI models. This process may involve data cleaning, feature engineering, and data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities. For more information, see Use generative AI for utilization management .
data parallelism
A way of scaling training or inference that replicates an entire model onto multiple devices and then passes a subset of the input data to each device. Data parallelism can enable training and inference on very large batch sizes; however, data parallelism requires that the model be small enough to fit on all devices. Data parallelism typically speeds training and inference.
dataset (data set)
A dataset is broadly defined as a collection of structured or unstructured data records. A collection of raw data, commonly (but not exclusively) organized in one of the following formats: a spreadsheet a file in CSV (comma-separated values) format. For more information, see Create a dataset .
data transformation
In the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), data transformation refers to the conversion of data into a format suitable for indexing and processing by an LLM. This often involves splitting data into smaller chunks to make it manageable for embedding and indexing. Other transformations might include cleaning and validation steps to ensure data quality. For more information, see RAG Engine overview .
decoder
In general, any ML system that converts from a processed, dense, or internal representation to a more raw, sparse, or external representation. Decoders are often a component of a larger model, where they are frequently paired with an encoder. In sequence-to-sequence tasks, a decoder starts with the internal state generated by the encoder to predict the next sequence.
deep neural network (DNN)
A neural network with multiple hidden layers, typically programmed through deep learning techniques.
depth
The sum of the following in a neural network: 1. the number of hidden layers 2. the number of output layers, which is typically one 3. the number of any embedding layers. For example, a neural network with five hidden layers and one output layer has a depth of 6. Notice that the input layer doesn't influence depth.
DevOps
DevOps is a suite of Google Cloud Platform products, for example, Artifact Registry, Cloud Deploy.
early stopping
A method for regularization that involves ending training before training loss finishes decreasing. In early stopping, you intentionally stop training the model when the loss on a validation dataset starts to increase; that is, when generalization performance worsens.
embedding
Numerical representations of words or pieces of text. These numbers capture the semantic meaning and context of the text. Similar or related words or text tend to have similar embeddings, which means they are closer together in the high-dimensional vector space.
embedding space (latent space)
In Generative AI, embedding space refers to a numerical representation of text, images, or videos that captures relationships between inputs. Machine learning models, particularly generative AI models, are adept at creating these embeddings by identifying patterns within large datasets. Applications can utilize embeddings to process and generate language, recognizing complex meanings and semantic relationships specific to the content.
embedding vector
A dense, often low-dimensional, vector representation of an item such that, if two items are semantically similar, their respective embeddings are located near each other in the embedding vector space.
encoder
In general, any ML system that converts from a raw, sparse, or external representation into a more processed, denser, or more internal representation. Encoders are often a component of a larger model, where they are frequently paired with a decoder. Some transformers pair encoders with decoders, though other transformers use only the encoder or only the decoder. Some systems use the encoder's output as the input to a classification or regression network. In sequence-to-sequence tasks, an encoder takes an input sequence and returns an internal state (a vector). Then, the decoder uses that internal state to predict the next sequence.
ensemble
A collection of models trained independently whose inferences are averaged or aggregated. In many cases, an ensemble produces better inferences than a single model. For example, a random forest is an ensemble built from multiple decision trees. Note that not all decision forests are ensembles.
environment
In reinforcement learning, the world that contains the agent and allows the agent to observe that world's state. For example, the represented world can be a game like chess, or a physical world like a maze. When the agent applies an action to the environment, then the environment transitions between states.
evaluation (eval)
An eval, short for "evaluation", is a type of experiment in which logged or synthetic queries are sent through two Search stacks--an experimental stack that includes your change and a base stack without your change. Evals produce diffs and metrics that let you evaluate the impact, quality, and other effects of your change on search results and other parts of the Google user experience. Evals are used during tuning, or iterations, on your change. They are also used as part of launching a change to live user traffic.
execution
An execution is a record of an individual machine learning workflow step, typically annotated with its runtime parameters. Examples of executions include data ingestion, data validation, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment.
F1 Score
The F1 score is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of a model's output. It's particularly useful for assessing the performance of models on tasks where both precision and recall are important, such as information extraction. For generative AI models, the F1 score can be used to compare the model's inferences with ground truth data to determine the model's accuracy. However, for generative tasks like summarization and text generation, other metrics like Rough-L score might be more appropriate.
feature
In machine learning (ML), a feature is a characteristic or attribute of an instance or entity that's used as an input to train an ML model or to make inferences.
feature extraction
In the context of generative AI, feature extraction refers to the process of identifying and selecting relevant features from input data to be used in model training. These features are then used to generate new data that resembles the original input. For example, in image generation, feature extraction might involve identifying edges, textures, and colors. In natural language processing, it could involve extracting keywords, phrases, and grammatical structures. The extracted features are then used by the generative model to create new content.
feature serving
Feature serving is the process of exporting or fetching feature values for training or inference. In Vertex AI, there are two types of feature serving—online serving and offline serving. Online serving retrieves the latest feature values of a subset of the feature data source for online inferences. Offline or batch serving exports high volumes of feature data—including historical data—for offline processing, such as ML model training.
feature view
A feature view is a logical collection of features materialized from a BigQuery data source to an online store instance. A feature view stores and periodically refreshes the customer's feature data, which is refreshed periodically from the BigQuery source. A feature view is associated with the feature data storage either directly or through associations to feature registry resources.
few-shot prompt (few-shot)
In generative AI, "few-shot" refers to a type of prompt that includes a small number of examples to guide the model's response. These examples help the model understand the desired output format, phrasing, scope, or general patterning of the response. Few-shot prompts are often used to regulate the output of language models, ensuring that they generate responses that are accurate, high-quality, and consistent with the user's expectations. By providing the model with a few relevant examples, the user can influence the model's behavior and obtain more satisfactory results. For more information, see Include few-shot examples .
foundation model (FM)

This means that they can accept inputs and produce outputs in more than one medium at once, including text, audio, and visual media. They are designed to integrate with agents capable of performing various tasks. For more information, see Google models .
generalization
A model's ability to make correct inferences on new, previously unseen data. A model that can generalize is the opposite of a model that is overfitting.
generation
In the context of generative AI, "generation" refers to the process of creating new data or content from existing data or information. Generative AI models are trained on large datasets and can learn patterns and relationships within the data. They can then use this knowledge to generate new and unique content that is similar to the training data but not an exact replica. For more information, see When to use generative AI or traditional AI .
generative model
A type of machine learning model that can create novel outputs based on its training data. At its simplest, the model generates new data that looks like a certain set of categories that it was trained on. Usually associated with large language models, but other types of models can be generative as well.

To achieve this broad vision, GEMS provides a comprehensive environment for developers, comprised of the major building blocks depicted below.
gradient
The vector of partial derivatives with respect to all of the independent variables. In machine learning, the gradient is the vector of partial derivatives of the model function. The gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent.
graph
In the context of generative AI, a graph refers to a structured representation of information that organizes and connects data as a network of nodes and edges. These graphs are often used to represent knowledge and relationships between entities, making them particularly useful for generative AI systems that require a deep understanding of the context and relationships within data. GenAI systems that leverage knowledge graphs can utilize them to enhance the performance of retrieval models. By incorporating knowledge graphs into the system, generative AI can access context-rich data and traverse the graph to retrieve relevant subgraphs based on user queries. This lets the system provide more accurate and informative responses by generating contextually relevant content.
ground truth (GT)
Ground truth is a term used in various fields to refer to the absolute truth of some decision or measurement problem, as opposed to some system's estimate. In machine learning, the term "ground truth" refers to the training set for supervised learning techniques.

index
A collection of vectors deployed together for similarity search. Vectors can be added to an index or removed from an index. Similarity search queries are issued to a specific index and will search over the vectors in that index.
inference
In the context of the Vertex AI platform, inference refers to the process of running data points through a machine learning model to calculate an output, such as a single numerical score. This process is also known as "operationalizing a machine learning model" or "putting a machine learning model into production." Inference is an important step in the machine learning workflow, since it enables models to be used to make inferences on new data. In Vertex AI, inference can be performed in various ways, including batch inference and online inference. Batch inference involves running a group of inference requests and outputting the results in one file, while online inference allows for real-time inferences on individual data points.
information retrieval (IR)

Prompts can contain questions, instructions, contextual information, few-shot examples, and partial input for the model to complete or continue. After the model receives a prompt, depending on the type of model being used, it can generate text, embeddings, code, images, videos, music, and more. For more information, see Overview of prompting strategies .
prompt engineering (prompt design)
Prompt engineering in generative AI is the process of crafting effective prompts to elicit desired outputs from large language models (LLMs). It's an iterative, test-driven process focused on refining inputs to achieve specific outcomes. This involves considering both the content and structure of the prompt to ensure accurate and high-quality responses. Effective prompt engineering is crucial for complex tasks, even though simpler tasks may not require it. The goal is to rapidly prototype LLM-based applications. For more information, see Introduction to prompt engineering .
prompt tuning
Prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method used to improve a generative AI model's performance on a specific task. It involves learning a "prefix" that is prepended to the actual prompt, sometimes at every layer. This approach is considered cheaper and faster than other tuning methods, often yielding good results. Prompt tuning is particularly effective when you have a specific task and want the model to perform it in a certain way. It's also sometimes referred to as prompt learning or parameter-efficient (fine) tuning. For more information, see Introduction to prompt engineering .

Quantization is a model optimization technique used to reduce the precision of the numbers used to represent a model's parameters. This can lead to smaller models, lower power consumption, and reduced inference latency.
Random Forest
Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. It's not directly a generative AI model itself, but it's a component that can be used within a larger generative AI system. A random forest consists of multiple decision trees, and its inference is an aggregation of the inferences from these individual trees. For example, in a classification task, each tree "votes" for a class, and the final inference is the class with the most votes For more information, see Decision forest .
Ray cluster on Vertex AI

recall
The percentage of true nearest neighbors returned by the index. For example, if a nearest neighbor query for 20 nearest neighbors returned 19 of the "ground truth" nearest neighbors, the recall is 19/20x100 = 95%.
recipe
In the context of Managed Training, a recipe is a comprehensive and reusable package that contains everything needed to execute a specific large-scale training workload.
recommendation system
A recommendation system is a machine learning-based system that helps users find compelling content in a large corpus. It generates a smaller subset of candidates from a potentially huge corpus, scores and ranks the candidates, and re-ranks the final ranking to take into account additional constraints. For more information, see Recommendation systems overview .
regularization
Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. One specific type of regularization mentioned is early stopping, where training is halted before the loss on a validation dataset begins to increase, indicating a decline in generalization performance. For more information, see Overfitting: L2 regularization .
Reinforcement Learning (RL)
A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. For more information, see RLHF Tuning with Vertex AI .
service account
Service accounts are special Google Cloud accounts used by applications or virtual machines to make authorized API calls to Google Cloud services. Unlike user accounts, they are not tied to an individual human but act as an identity for your code, enabling secure and programmatic access to resources without requiring human credentials. For more information, see Service accounts overview .
service agent
A service agent refers to a Google-managed service account. It's utilized when a service requires access to resources created by a different service. For instance, when Dataflow or Dataproc services need to create instances during runtime or when a Cloud Function wants to use the Key Management Service (KMS) to protect the Cloud Function. Service agents are created automatically by Google Cloud when a service requires them. They are typically used to manage access to resources and perform various tasks on behalf of the service. For more information, see Service agents .

TensorBoard
TensorBoard is a suite of web applications for visualizing and understanding TensorFlow runs and models. For more information, see TensorBoard .
TensorBoard instance
A TensorBoard instance is a regionalized resource that stores Vertex AI TensorBoard Experiments associated with a Project. You can create multiple TensorBoard instances in a project if, for example, you want multiple CMEK enabled instances. This is the same as the TensorBoard resource in the API.
TensorBoard Resource name
A TensorBoard Resource name is used to fully identify a Vertex AI TensorBoard instance. The format is as follows: projects/PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER/locations/REGION/tensorboards/TENSORBOARD_INSTANCE_ID.
time offset
Time offset is relative to the beginning of a video.
time series metrics
Time series metrics are longitudinal metric values where each value represents a step in the training routine portion of a run. Time series metrics are stored in Vertex AI TensorBoard. Vertex AI Experiments stores a reference to the Vertex TensorBoard resource.
token
A token in a language model is the atomic unit that the model is training and making inferences on, namely words, morphemes, and characters. In domains outside of language models, tokens can represent other kinds of atomic units. For example, in computer vision, a token might be a subset of an image. For more information, see List and count tokens .
trajectory
A "trajectory" refers to a sequence of steps or actions taken by an agent or model. It's often used in the evaluation of generative models, where the model's ability to generate text, code, or other content is assessed. There are several types of trajectory metrics that can be used to evaluate generative models, including trajectory exact match, trajectory in-order match, trajectory any order match, and trajectory precision. These metrics measure the similarity between the model's output and a set of human-generated reference outputs.
Transformer
A "Transformer" is a neural network architecture that underlies most state-of-the-art generative models. It's used in various language model applications, including translation. Transformers consist of an encoder and a decoder; the encoder converts input text into an intermediate representation, and the decoder converts this into useful output. They utilize a self-attention mechanism to gather context from words surrounding the word being processed. While training a Transformer requires significant resources, fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer for specific applications is more efficient.
Transformer Reinforcement Learning
Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) refers to the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to train transformer-based models for generative tasks. This approach addresses limitations of traditional generative models, which are often trained on next-token inference without explicit optimization for desirable qualities like coherence, safety, and sensibility. TRL directly optimizes the language model on complex objectives by using RL, often incorporating human feedback (RLHF) to guide the learning process. Examples include fine-tuning models to generate less toxic content using reward models and using TRL to fine-tune Gemma, a generative model. For more information, see Hugging Face DLCs: Fine-tuning Gemma with Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) on Vertex AI .
true positive
A "true positive" refers to an inference where the model correctly identifies a positive class. For example, if a model is trained to identify customers who will purchase a jacket, a true positive would be correctly predicting that a customer will make such a purchase.
validation
Validation checks the quality of a model's inferences against the validation set. This involves defining metrics to measure the generated content's quality, speed, adherence to instructions, and safety. Validation often uses labeled data (input prompts and expected outputs) to compare the model's inferences with the ground truth. Metrics like F1 score (for classification) and ROUGE-L score (for summarization) might be used. The process also includes testing edge cases and unusual scenarios to ensure robustness. For deployed models, continuous monitoring and capturing of common data points and edge cases help improve future validation efforts.
vector
A vector refers to a numerical representation of text, images, or videos that captures relationships between inputs. Machine learning models are suited for creating embeddings by identifying patterns within large datasets. Applications can use embeddings to process and produce language, recognizing complex meanings and semantic relationships specific to the content. For more information, see Embeddings APIs overview .
Vertex AI Agent Engine
Vertex AI Agent Engine, a part of the Vertex AI Platform, is a set of services that enables developers to deploy, manage, and scale AI agents in production. Agent Engine handles the infrastructure to scale agents in production so you can focus on creating applications. For more information, see Vertex AI Agent Engine overview .
Vertex AI Experiments

A secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud, which lets you define a virtual network that is logically isolated from other virtual networks in Google Cloud. For more information, see Virtual Private Cloud .
VPC Network Peering
A networking connection that allows two VPC networks to communicate privately. In the context of Managed Training on reserved clusters, VPC Network Peering is a critical component for integrating essential services. For instance, it is the required method for connecting your cluster's VPC to a Filestore instance, which provides the necessary shared `/home` directory for all the nodes in your cluster.
word embedding
Word embeddings are a way to represent words as dense vectors of floating-point values. This allows similar words to have similar encodings. Word embeddings are often used in generative AI to capture the relationships between words and generate new text or code, no sources. In generative AI, word embeddings can be used to train models that can generate new text or code. By understanding the relationships between words, generative AI models can create new content that is both coherent and relevant.
zero-shot prompt (direct prompting)
In generative AI, a zero-shot prompt is a prompt that enables a large language model (LLM) to perform a task without any additional training or examples. This contrasts with methods like few-shot prompting, which provides the model with example inputs and outputs. A zero-shot prompt relies solely on the model's pre-existing knowledge to generate a response. For more information, see zero-shot prompt .
zone
A specific deployment area within a Google Cloud region. In the context of Managed Training on reserved clusters, for best performance, all components of the service (the cluster, Filestore, and Managed Lustre instances) should be created in the same zone.
