Autopilot
Standard
This document describes how Cloud TPU works with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE),
including terminology, the benefits of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and
workload scheduling considerations. TPUs are Google's custom-developed,
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for accelerating ML workloads
that use frameworks such as TensorFlow ,
PyTorch , and JAX .
This document is for Platform admins and operators and Data and AI specialists who run
machine learning (ML) models that have characteristics such as being
large-scale, long-running, or dominated by matrix computations. To learn more
about common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud
content, see Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before reading this document, ensure that you're familiar with how ML accelerators
work. For details, see Introduction to Cloud TPU .
Benefits of using TPUs in GKE
GKE provides full support for TPU node and node pool lifecycle
management, including creating, configuring, and deleting TPU VMs. GKE
also supports Spot VMs and using reserved Cloud TPU.
For more information, see Cloud TPU consumption options .
Benefits of using TPUs in GKE include:
Consistent operational environment: You can use a single platform for all
machine learning and other workloads.
Automatic upgrades: GKE automates version updates, which
reduces operational overhead.
Load balancing: GKE distributes the load, thus reducing
latency and improving reliability.
Responsive scaling: GKE automatically scales TPU resources
to meet the needs of your workloads.
Resource management: With Kueue ,
a Kubernetes-native job queuing system, you can manage resources across
multiple tenants within your organization using queuing, preemption,
prioritization, and fair sharing.
Sandboxing options: GKE Sandbox helps to protect your workloads with
gVisor. For more information, see GKE Sandbox .
Get started with Ironwood (TPU7x)
Ironwood (TPU7x) is Google's seventh-generation TPU, designed for large-scale AI
workloads. For more information about Ironwood (TPU7x) benefits, see About Ironwood (TPU7x) in GKE .
Terminology related to TPUs in GKE
This document uses the following terminology related to TPUs:
Cloud TPU ICI resiliency: a feature that helps improve fault tolerance of the optical
links and optical circuit switches (OCS) that connect TPUs between cubes. For
more information, see
TPU architecture .
TPU cube: a 4x4x4 topology of interconnected TPU chips. This is only
applicable to topologies in 3-tuples ( {A}x{B}x{C} ).
TPU type: the Cloud TPU type, like v5e.
TPU slice: a collection of chips all located inside the same
TPU Pod connected by high-speed inter-chip interconnects (ICI). Slices are
described in terms of chips or TensorCores, depending on the TPU version.
TPU slice node: a Kubernetes node represented by a single VM that has one
or more interconnected TPU chips.
TPU slice node pool: a group of Kubernetes nodes within a cluster that all
have the same TPU configuration.
TPU topology: the number and physical arrangement of the TPU chips in a
TPU slice.
Atomic: GKE treats all the interconnected nodes as a
single unit. During scaling operations, GKE scales the entire
set of nodes to 0 and creates new nodes. If a machine in the group fails or
terminates, GKE recreates the entire set of nodes as a new
unit.
Immutable: you can't manually add new nodes to the set of interconnected
nodes. However, you can create a new node pool that has the TPU topology that
you want and schedule workloads on the new node pool.
Types of TPU slice node pools
GKE supports two types of TPU node pools:
Multi-host TPU slice
Single-host TPU slice
The TPU type and topology determine whether your TPU slice node can be
multi-host or single-host. We recommend:
For large-scale models, use multi-host TPU slice nodes.
For small-scale models, use single-host TPU slice nodes.
For large-scale training or inferencing, use Pathways . Pathways simplifies
large-scale machine learning computations by enabling a single
JAX client to
orchestrate workloads across multiple large TPU slices. For more information, see
Pathways .
Multi-host TPU slice node pools
A multi-host TPU slice node pool is a node pool that contains two or more
interconnected TPU VMs. Each VM has a TPU device connected to it. The TPUs in
a multi-host TPU slice are connected over a high speed interconnect (ICI). After
a multi-host TPU slice node pool is created, you can't add nodes to it. For
example, you can't create a v4-32
node pool and then later add a Kubernetes node (TPU VM) to the node pool. To add
a TPU slice to a GKE cluster, you must create a new node pool.
The VMs in a multi-host TPU slice node pool are treated as a single atomic unit.
If GKE is unable to deploy one node in the slice, no nodes in the
TPU slice node are deployed.
If a node within a multi-host TPU slice requires repairing, GKE
shuts down all VMs in the TPU slice, forcing eviction of all the Kubernetes Pods
in the workload. After all VMs in the TPU slice are up and running, the
Kubernetes Pods can be scheduled on the VMs in the new TPU slice.
The following diagram shows a v5litepod-16 (v5e) multi-host TPU slice. This
TPU slice has four VMs. Each VM in the TPU slice has four TPU v5e chips
connected with high-speed interconnects (ICI), and each TPU v5e chip has one
TensorCore:
The following diagram shows a GKE cluster that contains one TPU
v5litepod-16 (v5e) TPU slice (topology: 4x4 ) and one TPU v5litepod-8 (v5e)
slice (topology: 2x4 ):
Single-host TPU slice node pools
A single-host slice node pool is a node pool that contains one or more
independent TPU VMs. Each VM has a TPU device connected to it. While the VMs
within a single-host slice node pool can communicate over the Data Center
Network (DCN), the TPUs attached to the VMs are not interconnected.
The following diagram shows an example of a single-host TPU slice that contains
seven v4-8 machines:
Characteristics of TPUs in GKE
TPUs have unique characteristics that require special planning and configuration.
TPU consumption
To optimize resource utilization and cost while balancing workload performance,
GKE supports the following TPU consumption options:
Flex-start: to provision Flex-start VMs for up to seven days,
with GKE automatically allocating the hardware on a best-effort basis based on availability. For more information, see
About GPU, TPU, and H4D provisioning with flex-start provisioning mode .
Spot VMs: to provision Spot VMs, you can get
significant discounts, but Spot VMs can be preempted at any
time, with a 30-second warning. For more information, see
Spot VMs .
Future reservation for up to 90 days (in calendar mode): to provision TPU
resources for up to 90 days, for a specified time period. For more
information, see
Request TPUs with future reservation in calendar mode .
TPU reservations: to request a future reservation for one year or longer .
On-demand: to consume TPUs without arranging capacity in advance. Before requesting resources, you must have enough on-demand quota for the specific type and quantity of TPU VMs. On-demand is the most flexible consumption option; however, there is no guarantee that enough on-demand resources will be available to satisfy your request.
On-demand is the default consumption model for TPUs in GKE if you
don't specify another option.
To choose the consumption option that meets your workload requirements, see About accelerator consumption options for AI/ML workloads in GKE .
Before using TPUs in GKE, choose the consumption option that best
fits your workload requirements.
Topology
The topology defines the physical arrangement of TPUs within a TPU slice.
GKE provisions a TPU slice in two- or three-dimensional
topologies, depending on the TPU version. You specify a topology as the number
of TPU chips in each dimension as follows:
For TPU v4, v5p, and Ironwood (TPU7x) scheduled in multi-host TPU slice node pools, you define the
topology in 3-tuples ( {A}x{B}x{C} ), for example 4x4x4 . The product of
{A}x{B}x{C} defines the number of TPU chips in the node pool. For example, you
can define small topologies that have fewer than 64 TPU chips with topology
forms such as 2x2x2 , 2x2x4 , or 2x4x4 . If you use larger topologies that
have more than 64 TPU chips, the values you assign to {A}, {B}, and {C} must
meet the following conditions:
{A}, {B}, and {C} must be multiples of four.
The largest topology supported for v4 is 12x16x16 and v5p is 16x16x24 .
The assigned values must keep the A ≤ B ≤ C
pattern. For example, 4x4x8 or 8x8x8 .
Machine type naming
Machine type naming for TPUs in GKE varies depending on
the cluster mode and TPU version:
GKE Standard: you select a specific
Compute Engine machine type, for example, ct6e-standard-1t for TPU Trillium (v6e).
GKE Autopilot: you don't select machine types
directly. Instead, you request TPUs by using an accelerator type in your
workload manifest. For example, use tpu-v6e-slice for TPU Trillium (v6e)
or tpu-v5-lite-podslice for TPU v5e. GKE
Autopilot then provisions the underlying nodes with the
appropriate machine types to satisfy the request.
For the exact machine types available for each TPU version, refer to the tables
in Plan TPUs in GKE .
Privileged mode
If you use GKE versions earlier than 1.28, you must configure
your containers with special capabilities to access TPUs. In Standard
mode clusters, you can use privileged mode to grant this access. Privileged mode
overrides many of the other security settings in the securityContext . For
details, see Run containers without privileged mode .
Versions 1.28 and later don't require privileged mode or special capabilities.
How TPUs in GKE work
Kubernetes resource management and prioritization treat VMs on TPUs the same as
other VM types. To request TPU chips, use the resource name google.com/tpu :
resources :
requests :
google.com/tpu : 4
limits :
google.com/tpu : 4
When using TPUs in GKE, consider the following TPU
characteristics:
A VM can access up to 8 TPU chips.
A TPU slice contains a fixed number of TPU chips, with the number depending on
the TPU machine type that you choose.
The number of requested google.com/tpu must be equal to the total number of
available TPU chips on the TPU slice node. Any container in a
GKE Pod that requests TPUs must consume all the TPU chips in
the node. Otherwise, your Deployment fails because GKE can't
partially consume TPU resources. Consider the following scenarios:
The machine type ct5lp-hightpu-4t with a 2x4 topology contains two TPU
slice nodes with four TPU chips each, for a total of eight TPU chips. With
this machine type, you:
Can't deploy a GKE Pod that requires eight TPU chips on the
nodes in this node pool.
Can deploy two Pods that require four TPU chips each, each Pod on one of
the two nodes in this node pool.
TPU v5e with topology 4x4 has 16 TPU chips in four nodes. The
GKE Autopilot workload that selects this
configuration must request four TPU chips in each replica, for one to four
replicas.
In Standard clusters, multiple Kubernetes Pods can be scheduled on a
VM, but only one container in each Pod can access the TPU chips.
To create kube-system Pods, such as kube-dns, each Standard cluster
must have at least one non-TPU slice node pool.
By default, TPU slice nodes have the google.com/tpu taint
which prevents non-TPU workloads from being scheduled on the TPU slice nodes.
Workloads that don't use TPUs are run on non-TPU nodes, freeing up compute on
TPU slice nodes for code that uses TPUs. Note that the taint does not
guarantee that TPU resources are fully utilized.
GKE collects the logs emitted by containers running on TPU
slice nodes. To learn more, see Logging .
TPU utilization metrics, such as runtime performance, are available in
Cloud Monitoring. To learn more, see Observability and metrics .
You can sandbox your TPU workloads with GKE Sandbox. GKE Sandbox
works with TPU models v4 and later. To learn more, see GKE Sandbox .
Node pool auto-creation with TPUs
Node pool auto-creation supports the following Cloud TPUs only in
specific GKE versions:
TPU v3 : 1.31.0 and later.
TPU v5 and TPU v4 : 1.29.0 and later.
TPU Trillium : 1.32.0 and later.
Ironwood (TPU7x) : 1.34.1-gke.2541000 or later.
Other Cloud TPU types are supported in all GKE versions.
To learn more about the available GKE versions for TPUs, see
Validate TPU availability in GKE .
Cloud TPU node pool autoscaling
GKE scales automatically created or manually created
Cloud TPU node pools that use the cluster autoscaler in one of the
following ways:
Single-host TPU slice node pool : GKE adds or removes TPU
nodes in the existing node pool. The node pool might contain any number of TPU
nodes between zero and the maximum size of the node pool as determined by
the
--max-nodes
and the
--total-max-nodes
autoscaling flags. All of the TPU nodes in the node pool have the same
machine type and topology. For more information about how to create a
single-host TPU slice node pool, see
Create a single-host TPU slice node pool .
Multi-host TPU slice node pool : GKE atomically scales up
the node pool from zero to the number of nodes required to satisfy the TPU
topology. For example, with a TPU node pool that has the ct5lp-hightpu-4t
machine type and a topology of 16x16 , the node pool always has either 64
nodes or zero nodes. GKE scales the node pool down if there
are no TPU workloads in the node pool. To scale the node pool down,
GKE evicts all scheduled Pods and removes all of the nodes in
the node pool. For more information about how to create a multi-host TPU
slice node pool, see
Create a multi-host TPU slice node pool .
Collection scheduling
Collection scheduling is only supported for TPU Trillium.
In TPU Trillium, you can use collection scheduling to group TPU slice nodes.
Grouping these TPU slice nodes makes it easier to adjust the number of replicas to
meet the workload demand. Google Cloud controls software updates to ensure
that sufficient slices within the collection are always available to serve traffic.
TPU Trillium supports collection scheduling for single-host and multi-host node pools
that run inference workloads. The following describes how collection scheduling
behavior depends on the type of TPU slice that you use:
Multi-host TPU slice: GKE groups
multi-host TPU slices to form a collection. Each
GKE node pool is a replica within
this collection. To define a collection, create a multi-host TPU slice
and assign a unique name to the collection. To add more TPU slices
to the collection, create another multi-host TPU slice node pool with the same
collection name and workload type.
Single-host TPU slice: GKE considers the entire
single-host TPU slice node pool as a collection. To add more TPU slices
to the collection, you can resize the single-host TPU slice node pool.
Collection scheduling has the following limitations:
You can only schedule collections for TPU Trillium.
You can define collections only during node pool creation.
Spot VMs are not supported.
Collections that contain multi-host TPU slice node pools must use the same
machine type, topology, and version for all node pools within the collection.
You can configure collection scheduling in the following scenarios:
When creating a TPU slice node pool in GKE Standard
When deploying workloads on GKE Autopilot
When creating a cluster that enables node auto-provisioning
