Cloud TPU quotas
This document lists the quotas that apply to Cloud TPU. For information
about Cloud TPU pricing, see Cloud TPU pricing .
Google Cloud uses quotas to help ensure fairness and reduce
spikes in resource use and availability. A quota restricts how much of a
Google Cloud resource your Google Cloud project can use. Quotas
apply to a range of resource types, including hardware, software, and network
components. For example, quotas can restrict the number of API calls to a
service, the number of load balancers used concurrently by your project, or the
number of projects that you can create. Quotas protect the community of
Google Cloud users by preventing the overloading of services. Quotas also
help you to manage your own Google Cloud resources.
The Cloud Quotas system does the following:
Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services
Restricts your consumption of those resources
Provides a way to
request changes to the quota value
and automate quota adjustments
In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota
allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that
you're trying to perform fails.
Quotas generally apply at the Google Cloud project
level. Your use of a resource in one project doesn't affect
your available quota in another project. Within a Google Cloud project, quotas
are shared across all applications and IP addresses.
For more information, see the
Cloud Quotas overview .
Important: This document describes Cloud TPU API quota. If you are creating
TPU slices in
GKE , you
use Compute Engine API quota, which is a different quota. You must use
GKE to use Ironwood (TPU7x). For more information about quotas
you use for TPUs in GKE, see Ensure sufficient
quota
TPU quota
TPU quotas are limits on the number of Cloud TPU cores you can use with a
Google Cloud project. Each version of TPU is associated with its own quota. In
addition, each Cloud TPU version quota is divided into on-demand quota and
preemptible (or spot) quota.
Note: For more information about TPU chips and TensorCores, see TPU System
architecture .
When you create Cloud TPU resources, by default you are creating on-demand
resources. You can create preemptible resources using the --spot parameter
when creating resources with the gcloud command. For more information, see
Manage TPU resources .
Default Cloud TPU quotas
The following tables show default values for on-demand and preemptible quota for
each available zone . These values specify the maximum
number of TPU cores you can use within your project.

Note: All requests for quota in us-central2-b (currently, only TPU v4) need to
be manually approved by Google. No default quota is granted. If you require quota
in us-central2-b, request quota for v4 using the same process as described
in the following section.
View and request additional quota
You can view the quota allocated for your Google Cloud project on the
Quotas page in the Google Cloud console .
You can request additional Cloud TPU quota, from the Quotas page .
To find the quota you want to increase, click the three vertical dots and choose
Edit quota . For more information, see Request a quota adjustment .
If you request quota below the auto-approve threshold, your request will be
automatically approved.

You will receive an email stating if your quota request is approved or denied.
Google Cloud service quota increases take place gradually. This might result in
ongoing rollouts across different regions or resources. During the rollout, the
quota value that appears in the Google Cloud console or Cloud Quotas API
won't reflect the new, increased quota value until the rollout completes. For
more information, see View ongoing
rollouts .
