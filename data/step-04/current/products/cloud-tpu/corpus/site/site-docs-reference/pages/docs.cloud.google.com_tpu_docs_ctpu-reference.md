CTPU Reference
Overview
Important: The ctpu tool has been deprecated and the tool functionality
has been replaced by corresponding gcloud compute tpus commands .
The open source ctpu tool is used to create a flock of compute resources,
which consist of a Compute Engine VM and one or more
Cloud TPU devices. The tool is pre-installed in your Cloud
shell.
You can find
documentation and code for ctpu
on GitHub.
The ctpu tool uses the following syntax:
ctpu <subcommand> <flags> <subcommand> <subcommand args>
Following are the subcommands for ctpu :
auth
Description
Set or display authorization(s) for Cloud TPUs.
Usage
ctpu auth <flags> <subcommand> <subcommand args>
Example
ctpu auth list --project="my-project" --zone=us-central1-a
ctpu auth list --project my-project --zone us-central1-a
Subcommands
The ctpu auth command supports the following subcommands:
add-bigtable - ensure Cloud TPU is authorized for Cloud Bigtable
add-gcs - ensure Cloud TPU is authorized for Cloud Storage
list - display Cloud TPU service account authorizations
commands - list all command names
flags - describe all known top-level flags
help - describe subcommands and their syntax
Optional Flags
The following are optional commands for ctpu auth .
name | project | zone
delete (rm)
Description
Delete your Compute Engine VM and Cloud TPU.
Usage
ctpu rm <flags>
Example
ctpu rm --zone=us-central1-b
help
Description
List all ctpu subcommands and top level flags.
Usage
ctpu help
ctpu help <subcommand>
Example
ctpu help // list all ctpu subcommands and top level flags
ctpu help auth // list all flags that can be used with `ctpu auth`
ctpu help up // list all flags that can be used with `ctpu up`
list (ls)
Description
List all Compute Engine VMs and Cloud TPU in the specified zone.
Usage
ctpu ls <flags>
Example
ctpu ls --zone=us-central1-b
pause (zz)
Description
Stop the Compute Engine VM, and delete your Cloud TPU.
Stop charging for Cloud TPU usage until you run ctpu up .
To ensure that the Cloud TPU is stopped, you must
specify the Cloud TPU name and the zone on the
command line.
Important: You will still be charged for the
disk space consumed by your VM while it is paused.
Usage
ctpu pause <name, zone>
Example
ctpu pause --name=my-tpu --zone=us-central1-a // pause the named TPU
in the specified zone
print-config (cfg)
Description
Print onscreen the current configuration of the Cloud TPU name,
project name, and zone.
Example
ctpu print-config
quota
Description
Display a URL where you can see quotas.
Usage
ctpu quota
Example
ctpu quota
Output: Quotas cannot currently be displayed within ctpu .
To view your quota, open <url>
Request additional quota from <url>
restart
Description
Restarts a Cloud TPU that is still in the RUNNING state
(shown in ctpu status ), but has stopped running because of
a hardware problem. Use gcloud compute tpu start or the START
button on the Compute Engine > TPUs page in the Cloud console
if the TPU is in the STOPPED state.
restart does not restart a preempted Cloud TPU.
You need to run ctpu delete and ctpu up if your
Cloud TPU has been preempted.
Usage
ctpu restart <flags>
Example
ctpu restart --zone=us-central1-a
status (st)
Description
Query the GCP APIs (default zone only) to determine the current status of your
Cloud TPU and Compute Engine VM.
Important: If your resources are running in a
non-default region or zone, you _must_ specify the `--zone` flag.
Usage
ctpu st
Example
ctpu st --zone=us-central1-a
Status message:
Your cluster is running!
Compute Engine VM: RUNNING
Cloud TPU: RUNNING
tpu-locations
Description
List all zones where TPU types
are available.
Usage
ctpu tpu-locations
Output
Cloud TPU Locations:
asia-east1-c
europe-west4-a
us-central1-a
us-central1-b
us-central1-c
tpu-sizes
Description
List all available TPU sizes in specified zone. Some sizes are available
only in
certain zones . (default = default zone)
Usage
tpu-sizes <zone>
Example
ctpu tpu-sizes --zone=us-central1-a
up
Description
Bring up a ctpu resource set. The first time you run
ctpu up on a project, it takes longer than it will in future runs because it
is performing tasks such as SSH key propagation and API turn-up.
Enables the Compute Engine and Cloud TPU services.
Creates a Compute Engine VM with the latest stable TensorFlow
version pre-installed.
Assigns a default zone, such as us-central1-b based on your location.
Passes the name of the Cloud TPU to the Compute Engine
VM as an environment variable ( TPU_NAME ).
Ensures your Cloud TPU has access to resources it needs from
your Google Cloud project, by granting specific IAM roles to your
Cloud TPU service account.
Performs a number of other checks.
Logs you into your new Compute Engine VM. Your shell prompt changes
from username@project to username@tpuname .
You can run ctpu up as often as you like. For example, if you lose the SSH
connection to the Compute Engine VM, run ctpu up to restore the
connection. You must specify a zone if your Compute Engine is not in
the default zone. For example:
$ ctpu up --zone = us-central1-a
Usage
ctpu up <flags>
Example
ctpu up --tpu-size=v2-8 --disk-size-gb=320 --preemptible
Flags
--disk-size-gb
Configure the root volume size of your Compute Engine VM.
Value must be an integer. (default = 250)
--dry-run
Do not make changes; print only what would have happened.
--forward-agent
Enable ssh agent forwarding when sshing into the Compute Engine VM.
SSH Agent Forwarding enables access to shared repositories (such as GitHub)
without having to place private keys on the Compute Engine VM.
(default = true)
--forward-ports
Automatically forward useful ports from the Compute Engine VM to your local
machine. Ports forwarded are: 6006 (tensorboard), 8888 (jupyter notebooks),
8470 (TPU port), 8466 (TPU profiler port). (default = true)
--gce-image
Override the automatically chosen Compute Engine Image. Use this flag when
you are using your own custom images instead of the ones provided with
the installed TensorFlow.
--gcp-network
Specify the network in which the Cloud TPU and associated VM should
be created. Refer to
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network Overview
for information on networks. (default = default network)
--log-http
Print the full content of http request-response pairs. To enable the printout,
set this flag to true . Use this flag when you need log output to file a bug report against ctpu .
Refer to ctpu README
for details.
--machine-type
Configure the size of your Compute Engine VM. A full list of machine
types is available on the Cloud
Machine Types page.
(default = n1-standard-2)
--name
Override the name to use for VMs and Cloud TPU.
(default = your username)
--noconf
Skip confirmation.
--preemptible
Create a preemptible Cloud TPU node. A preemptible
Cloud TPU costs less per hour than a non-preemptible one.
Cloud TPU service can exit a preemptible device at any
time.
(default = non-preemptible)
--preemptible-vm
Create a preemptible Compute Engine VM. A preemptible VM costs less
per hour than a non-preemptible VM. The Compute Engine service can
exit the VM instance at any time.
(default = non-preemptible)
--print-welcome
Always print the welcome message.
--project
Override the GCP project name to use when allocating VMs and TPUs. Specify a
value from cloud config or Compute Engine metadata, usually
your project name. If a good value cannot be found, you must to provide a
value on the command line.
--tf-version
Set the version of TensorFlow to use when creating the Compute Engine
VM and the Cloud TPU. (default = latest stable release)
--tpu-only
Allocate a Cloud TPU only; use this only if you already have a
VM available.
--tpu-size
Configure the size and hardware version of a Cloud TPU.
--use-dl-images
Use Deep Learning VM Images
(refer docs: https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm/) instead of TPU machine
images. (default = TPU machine images)
--vm-only
Allocate a VM only; use this when you are not ready to set up and pay for a TPU.
--zone
Override the Compute Engine zone to use when allocating VMs and
Cloud TPU.
On the command line, run ctpu help up to view the list.
version
Description
Prints out the version of ctpu installed.
Usage
ctpu version
Output
ctpu version
Output: ctpu version: 1.9
