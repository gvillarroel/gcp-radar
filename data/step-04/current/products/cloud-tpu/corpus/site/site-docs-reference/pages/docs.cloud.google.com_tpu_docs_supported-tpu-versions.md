TPU software versions
Note: This page applies to the Cloud TPU API. For Ironwood (TPU7x), you must use
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). For more information, see
About TPUs in GKE .
This document provides guidance on selecting the appropriate TPU software
version when you create Cloud TPUs.
When you create TPU resources, you specify the software version, also called
runtime version, which refers to the software environment that is pre-installed
on your TPU VM. This includes the Ubuntu operating system, Docker, and other
software required to run your code on TPUs.
If you're using the Google Cloud CLI, you specify the TPU software
version using the --version or --runtime-version parameter. If you're using
the Google Cloud console, you select a TPU software version from the TPU software
version list.
PyTorch and JAX
Use the following common TPU software versions for PyTorch and JAX, then install
the framework you want to use.
TPU version
TPU software version
Trillium (v6e)
v2-alpha-tpuv6e
v5p
v2-alpha-tpuv5
v5e
v2-alpha-tpuv5-lite
v4 and older
tpu-ubuntu2204-base
For more information about installation and getting started with PyTorch or JAX,
see Run a calculation on a Cloud TPU VM using PyTorch
and Run a calculation on a Cloud TPU VM
using JAX .
TensorFlow
Note: TensorFlow is not supported on Ironwood (TPU7x).
TPU software versions for TensorFlow follow a specific naming
convention:
tpu-vm-tf-x.y.z[-{pod}][-{device_api}]
x.y.z : Represents the major, minor, and patch versions of
TensorFlow.
-pod (optional): Indicates that you're using a multi-host TPU slice.
-{device_api} (optional): Specifies the device API, for example,
-pjrt (if you're using the PJRT API ).
See the following sections for more information on how to
specify a TPU software version.
There are TPU software versions specific to each version of TensorFlow.
The following table shows the supported TensorFlow versions and
associated libtpu versions:

2.18.0

For more information about TensorFlow patch versions, see
Supported TensorFlow patch versions .
TPU v6e, v5p, and v5e
TPU v6e, v5e, and v5p support TensorFlow 2.15.0 and newer. You specify
the TPU software version using the form: tpu-vm-tf-x.y.z-{pod}-pjrt where x
is the major TensorFlow version, y is the minor version, and z is
the TensorFlow patch version. Add pod after the TensorFlow
version if you are using a multi-host TPU. For example, if you are using
TensorFlow 2.16.0 on a multi-host TPU, use the
tpu-vm-tf-2.16.0-pod-pjrt TPU software version. For other versions of
TensorFlow, replace 2.16.0 with the major and patch versions of
TensorFlow you are using. If you are using a single-host TPU, omit
pod .
TPU v4
If you're using TPU v4 and TensorFlow 2.10.1 or newer, follow the
instructions for TPU v2 and v3 . If you're using TensorFlow
2.10.0 or earlier, use a v4-specific TPU software version:
TensorFlow version
TPU software version
2.10.0
tpu-vm-tf-2.10.0-v4 tpu-vm-tf-2.10.0-pod-v4
2.9.3
tpu-vm-tf-2.9.3-v4 tpu-vm-tf-2.9.3-pod-v4
2.9.2
tpu-vm-tf-2.9.2-v4 tpu-vm-tf-2.9.2-pod-v4
2.9.1
tpu-vm-tf-2.9.1-v4 tpu-vm-tf-2.9.1-pod-v4
TPU v2 and v3
If you are using TPU v2 or v3, use the TPU software version that matches the
version of TensorFlow you are using. For example if you are using
TensorFlow 2.14.1, use the tpu-vm-tf-2.14.1 TPU software version. For
other versions of TensorFlow, replace 2.14.1 with the
TensorFlow version you are using. If you are using a multi-host TPU,
append pod to the end of the TPU software version, for example
tpu-vm-tf-2.14.1-pod .
Beginning with TensorFlow 2.15.0, you must also specify a device API as
part of the software version name. For example, if you are using
TensorFlow 2.16.1 with the PJRT API, use the TPU software version
tpu-vm-tf-2.16.1-pjrt . If you are using the stream executor API with the same
version of TensorFlow, use the tpu-vm-tf-2.16.1-se TPU software
version. TensorFlow versions older than 2.15.0 only support stream
executor.
TensorFlow PJRT support
Beginning with TensorFlow 2.15.0, you can use the PJRT interface for
TensorFlow on TPU. PJRT features automatic device memory defragmentation
and simplifies the integration of hardware with frameworks. For more information
about PJRT, see
PJRT: Simplifying ML Hardware and Framework Integration .
Important: TPU v5e and future TPU generations only support PJRT. Not all features
of TPU v2, v3, and v4 have been migrated to the PJRT API. The following table
describes which features are supported on PJRT or stream executor.
