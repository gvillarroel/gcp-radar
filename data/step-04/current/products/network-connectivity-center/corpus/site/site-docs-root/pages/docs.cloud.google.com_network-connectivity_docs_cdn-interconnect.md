CDN Interconnect overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
CDN Interconnect enables select third-party Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers
to establish direct peering links with Google's edge network at various locations, which enables you
to direct your traffic from your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks to a provider's network.
CDN Interconnect enables you to optimize your CDN population costs and use
direct connectivity to select CDN providers from Google Cloud.
Your network traffic egressing from Google Cloud through one of these links benefits from
the direct connectivity to supported CDN providers and is billed automatically with reduced
pricing.
Setting up CDN Interconnect
If your CDN provider is already part of the program, you don't have to do anything. Traffic from
supported Google Cloud locations to your CDN provider automatically takes advantage of the
direct connection and reduced pricing.
Work with your supported CDN provider to learn what locations are supported
and how to correctly configure your deployment to use intra-region egress routes.
CDN Interconnect does not require any configuration or integration with
Cloud Load Balancing.
If your CDN provider is not part of the program, contact your CDN provider
and ask them to work with Google to get connected.
Typical use cases for CDN Interconnect
High-volume egress traffic. If you're populating your CDN with large data files from
Google Cloud, you can use the CDN Interconnect links between
Google Cloud and selected providers to automatically optimize this traffic and save money.
Frequent content updates. Cloud workloads that frequently update data stored in CDN
locations benefit from using CDN Interconnect because the direct link to the
CDN provider reduces latency for these CDN destinations.
For example, if you have frequently updated data served by the CDN originally
hosted on Google Cloud, you might consider using CDN Interconnect.
