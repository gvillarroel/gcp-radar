Key terms
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides key terminology that applies to Network Connectivity
products. Review these terms to better understand how each product
works.
Google Cloud terms
The following terminology applies to Google Cloud and its features.
Google Cloud
Google Cloud is a suite of public cloud computing services offered by Google.
For more information, see
Google Cloud products .
project ID
The ID of your Google Cloud project. A project contains networking
resources such as networks, subnets, and Cloud VPN gateways as described
in the VPC network overview . For a
description of the difference between project name , project ID , and project
number , see
Identifying projects .
You can view the project ID in the
Google Cloud console .
Cloud VPN terms
The following terms apply to Cloud VPN gateways and tunnels and
gateways on your peer network.
Cloud VPN gateway
A virtual VPN gateway running in Google Cloud managed by Google, using
a configuration that you specify in your project, and used only by you. Each
Cloud VPN gateway is a regional resource that uses one or more regional
external IP addresses. A Cloud VPN gateway can connect
to a peer VPN gateway.
Classic VPN
The predecessor to HA VPN. For more information, see
Types of
Cloud VPN: Classic VPN .
HA VPN
Replaces Classic VPN with a gateway that provides a 99.99%
availability SLA. For more information, see
Types of
Cloud VPN: HA VPN .
external VPN gateway
A gateway resource that you configure in Google Cloud for
HA VPN that provides information to Google Cloud
about your peer VPN gateway or gateways. Depending on the high availability
recommendations from your peer VPN gateway vendor, you can create an external
VPN gateway resource for the different types of peer VPN gateways described in
Cloud VPN
topologies .
Note: All peer gateway scenarios are
represented in Google Cloud by a single external peer VPN resource.
peer VPN gateway
A gateway that is connected to a Cloud VPN gateway. A peer VPN
gateway can be one of the following:
Another Cloud VPN gateway
A VPN gateway hosted by another cloud provider such as AWS or Microsoft Azure
An on-premises VPN device or VPN service
Note: Cloud VPN instructions
are written from the point of view of your
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, so the peer VPN gateway is the gateway that connects
to Cloud VPN.
remote peer IP address
For an HA VPN gateway interface that connects to an external
VPN gateway, the remote peer IP address is the IP address of the interface on the external
VPN gateway that is used for the tunnel.
For an HA VPN gateway interface that connects to
another HA VPN gateway, the remote peer IP address is
the IP address of the other HA VPN gateway's interface
that is used for the tunnel.
For Classic VPN, the remote peer IP address is the external IP address
of the peer VPN gateway.
VPN tunnel
A VPN tunnel connects two VPN gateways and serves as a virtual medium through
which encrypted traffic is passed. Two VPN tunnels must be established to
create a connection between two VPN gateways: each tunnel defines the
connection from the perspective of its gateway, and traffic can only pass after
the pair of tunnels is established. A Cloud VPN tunnel is
always associated with a specific Cloud VPN gateway resource.
connection
As defined for Google Cloud, a logical link between
Cloud VPN and peer VPN locations as identified by
a vpnGateway resource at one end, and an
externalVpnGateway or another
Google Cloud VpnGateway resource at the peer end. A connection
also includes all the vpnTunnel resources and BGP sessions
between the gateway resources.
Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
IKE is the protocol used for authentication and to negotiate a session key for
encrypting traffic.
Note: Cloud VPN always initiates IKE. If two
Cloud VPN gateways are involved, either can act as the IKE initiator.
Cloud VPN gateway MTU
The size in bytes of the largest IP packet—including headers, data,
and IPsec overhead—supported by a Cloud VPN tunnel.
Cloud VPN payload MTU
The size in bytes of the largest IP packet—including headers and
data—that can be successfully encrypted and sent in a
Cloud VPN tunnel without fragmentation. In other words, the
original packet size not counting IPsec overhead.
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect gateway
MTU
The size in bytes of the largest IP packet—including headers, data,
and IPsec overhead—supported by a
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect tunnel.
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect
payload MTU
The size in bytes of the largest IP packet—including headers and
data—that can be successfully encrypted and sent in a
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect tunnel without fragmentation. In other
words, the original packet size not counting Cloud Interconnect
overhead and IPsec overhead.
Cloud Interconnect terms
The following key terminology describes the concepts on which
Cloud Interconnect is built. Each section indicates whether a term applies
to Dedicated Interconnect, Partner Interconnect,
Cross-Cloud Interconnect, Cross-Site Interconnect,
or a combination thereof.
Cloud Interconnect elements
Interconnect connection
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect,
Cross-Cloud Interconnect, and Cross-Site Interconnect.
For Dedicated Interconnect and Cross-Site Interconnect
A specific physical connection between Google and your on-premises
network. This connection exists in a colocation
facility where your on-premises network and Google's network meet.
A single connection can be a single link or a link bundle. If you have multiple connections to
Google at different locations or to different devices, you must create separate Interconnect
connections. For more information about connection capacities, see one of the following:
Dedicated Interconnect: Port capacity .
Cross-Site Interconnect: Port capacity .
For Cross-Cloud Interconnect
A specific physical connection between Google and the network of another
cloud service provider (the remote cloud service
provider ). This connection exists in a single
colocation facility or in adjoining facilities,
where the networks of Google and the remote cloud service provider
meet.
A single connection can be a single link, or a link bundle depending on what the remote cloud
provider supports. For more information about capacity, see
Port capacity .
connection type
The type of Cloud Interconnect connection falls into one of the following
categories:
Dedicated Interconnect
Partner Interconnect
Cross-Cloud Interconnect
Partner Cross-Cloud Interconnect for OCI
Cross-Site Interconnect
VLAN attachment
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect,
Partner Interconnect,
Cross-Cloud Interconnect, and Partner Cross-Cloud Interconnect for OCI.
A VLAN (virtual local area network) attachment is a logical connection
between an external network and a single region in your
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. In the Compute Engine API, the VLAN
attachment is known as an interconnectAttachment
resource.
When you create a VLAN attachment, you associate it with a project, a
region, an existing or new
Cloud Router , and an existing
Cloud Interconnect connection. Then you configure a Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) session between the Cloud Router and your
external router .
For Dedicated Interconnect, the VLAN attachment uses a
dedicated connection that you create to reach your on-premises router.
For Partner Interconnect, the attachment uses a
connection that your chosen partner sets up and manages.
For Cross-Cloud Interconnect, the attachment uses a
connection that Google creates on your behalf between the networks of
Google Cloud and your remote cloud service
provider .
A VLAN attachment is not directly associated with a VPC
network. However, it's indirectly tied to a single VPC
network because a Cloud Router can be associated with only one
network. Therefore, the VLAN attachment is tied to the network where the
Cloud Router is located.
To fully use the bandwidth of a given Cloud Interconnect
connection, you might need to create multiple VLAN attachments.
Creating VLAN attachments with a combined bandwidth greater than the
Cloud Interconnect connection doesn't give you more than the
stated bandwidth of the connection. For example, consider the following:
To fully use the bandwidth of 2 x 10-Gbps Cloud Interconnect
connections, you need a 20-Gbps VLAN attachment.
To fully use the bandwidth of 5 x 10-Gbps Cloud Interconnect
connections, you need a 50-Gbps VLAN attachment.
For Dedicated Interconnect
A VLAN attachment for Dedicated Interconnect allocates a
single 802.1Q VLAN on your Dedicated Interconnect
connection and connects it to a specific VPC network.
Because each connection for Dedicated Interconnect supports
multiple VLAN attachments, you can access multiple VPC
networks without creating multiple connections.
Each attachment that you create is associated with a VPC
network and a Google Cloud region:
When you associate an attachment for
Dedicated Interconnect with a VPC network,
this network must be in a project in the same organization as the
project that contains the Dedicated Interconnect
connection.
The set of valid regions for an attachment depends on the
colocation facility used by the
Cloud Interconnect.
You can set the capacity of each attachment. For a list of capacities, see
the
Pricing page. The default attachment capacity is 10 Gbps.
The capacity setting limits the maximum bandwidth that an attachment can
use. If you have multiple attachments on a single
Dedicated Interconnect connection, the capacity limitation
might be helpful in cases where you want to prevent network congestion on
your connection. The maximum bandwidth is approximate, so it's possible
for an attachment to use more bandwidth than the selected capacity.
Because the capacity setting only limits the data transfer bandwidth from
Google Cloud to the colocation facility for the Interconnect
connection, we recommend that you configure a data transfer rate limiter
on your router for your connection. Configuring this limiter enables you
to cap the maximum inbound data transfer bandwidth to your
VPC network for traffic using that connection.
For Partner Interconnect
To request Partner Interconnect connectivity from a
service provider , you create a VLAN
attachment in your Google Cloud project. The VLAN attachment generates a
unique pairing key that you share with your
service provider. The service provider uses the pairing key, along with
your requested connection location and capacity, to complete the
configuration of your VLAN attachment.
After your service provider configures the attachment, they allocate a
specific 802.1q VLAN on your on-premises connection.
For Cross-Cloud Interconnect
A VLAN attachment for Cross-Cloud Interconnect allocates a
single 802.1Q VLAN on your Cross-Cloud Interconnect
connection. The VLAN attachment and the associated Cloud Router link
your connection to a specific VPC network. Because each
Cross-Cloud Interconnect connection can support multiple
VLAN attachments, you can access multiple VPC networks
without creating multiple connections.
The following requirements apply:
When you associate a Cloud Router with your VLAN attachment, you
associate the attachment with a VPC network. That network
must be in the same project as the
Cross-Cloud Interconnect connection.
The set of valid regions for an attachment depends on the locations
supported by Google Cloud and by your
remote cloud service provider .
You can select a capacity for each attachment. For a list of capacities,
see the Pricing page. The
default capacity is 10 Gbps. This setting affects the maximum bandwidth
that the attachment can use. If you have multiple VLAN attachments, we
recommend setting a capacity for each of them. Doing so can prevent any
single attachment from using the entire bandwidth of the connection, which
can cause packets to be dropped. The maximum bandwidth is approximate, so
it's possible for an attachment to use more bandwidth than the selected
capacity.
The capacity setting limits only the outbound data transfer bandwidth
from Google Cloud to the colocation facility for the
Cross-Cloud Interconnect connection. For this reason, we
recommend that you configure an outbound data transfer rate limiter on
the virtual router in your remote cloud. Configuring this limiter
enables you to cap the maximum inbound data transfer bandwidth to your
VPC network for traffic using that connection.
For Partner Cross-Cloud Interconnect for OCI
A VLAN Attachment for Partner Cross-Cloud Interconnect for OCI establishes cross-cloud connectivity
with OCI on pre-built physical connectivity between Oracle and Google Cloud. You order
a partner VLAN attachment in your project and input the
pairing key when you get an Oracle Fast Connect virtual circuit, specifying
requested capacity through Oracle's interface. This establishes BGP connectivity
directly between your networks within the two clouds.
Cloud Router
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect,
Partner Interconnect, and
Cross-Cloud Interconnect.
Cloud Router uses Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to dynamically
exchange routes between your VPC network and your external
network. Before you can create a VLAN attachment, you must create or
select an existing Cloud Router in the VPC network
that you want to connect to. You then use the Cloud Router to
configure a BGP session with your external
router .
For detailed information about Cloud Router, see the
Cloud Router overview .
The BGP configuration of the Cloud Router depends on whether
you're using Layer 2 or Layer 3 connectivity.
Dedicated Interconnect and
Cross-Cloud Interconnect use only Layer 2 connectivity.
Partner Interconnect can use Layer 2 or Layer 3
connectivity.
For Layer 2, you establish a BGP session between your
Cloud Router and your external router.
For Layer 3, your service provider establishes a BGP session between
your Cloud Router and their edge router. For more information,
see
Layer 2 versus Layer 3 connectivity .
Cloud Router advertises subnets in its VPC network
and propagates learned routes to those subnets. Unless you configure
custom advertised routes , Cloud Router advertises the
following routes:
If your VPC network uses regional dynamic routing
mode , Cloud Router advertises
subnet routes in the region
where it's located.
If your VPC network uses global dynamic routing
mode , Cloud Router advertises subnet routes in all
regions.
Cloud Router also creates dynamic routes in your
VPC network for destinations that it learns from your
external router. If your VPC network uses regional dynamic
routing mode, Cloud Router makes those routes available to only
the region where it's located. If your network uses global dynamic routing
mode, Cloud Router makes those routes available to all regions.
on-premises router
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect,
Partner Interconnect, and Cross-Site Interconnect.
The on-premises router is an external router
that establishes a BGP session with Cloud Router, or an Ethernet session
with another on-premises router.
This connection lets you exchange data between your on-premises network and your
VPC network, or between your on-premises networks.
For Dedicated Interconnect and Cross-Site Interconnect,
you manage the on-premises
router, which is often physically located in the colocation facility where
your connection is provisioned. However, the device can be physically
located in another facility, such as an office location where you manage
networking equipment. You establish the BGP sessions between your
on-premises router and Cloud Router, or Ethernet sessions between your on-premises
routers.
For Partner Interconnect, an on-premises router is a device
that either you or the service provider uses to configure BGP sessions with
Cloud Router.
With Layer 2 Partner Interconnect connections, you
configure the BGP session between your on-premises router and
Cloud Router.
With Layer 3 Partner Interconnect connections, your
service provider manages the BGP session between their on-premises
router and Cloud Router.
For more information about different Partner Interconnect
connections, see
Layer 2 versus Layer 3 connectivity .
For information about configuring on-premises routers, see the following
documents:
Configure on-premises routers (Dedicated Interconnect)
Configure on-premises routers (Partner Interconnect)
Configure on-premises routers (Cross-Site Interconnect)
external router
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect,
Partner Interconnect,
Cross-Cloud Interconnect, and Cross-Site Interconnect.
An external router is a networking device that provides access to the
network that you want to peer with. The external router can be one of the
following:
An on-premises router
A virtual router hosted by your
remote cloud service provider
Cloud Interconnect locations
connection location or colocation facility
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect and Cross-Site Interconnect,
with notes for Partner Interconnect and
Cross-Cloud Interconnect.
The colocation facility where a physical Cloud Interconnect
connection is provisioned. This location is where your on-premises routing
equipment meets Google's peering edge.
A colocation facility is where Google has a point of presence (PoP),
enabling you to connect your on-premises network with Google's network. In
the colocation facility, you work with the facility provider to provision
your routing equipment before using
Dedicated Interconnect.
For connections to Google Cloud through VLAN attachments, each connection location supports a subset of Google Cloud regions.
For example, lga-zone1-16 supports VLAN attachments in the
regions northamerica-northeast1 ,
northamerica-northeast2 , us-central1 ,
us-east1 , us-east4 , us-east5 ,
us-south1 , us-west1 , us-west2 ,
us-west3 , and us-west4 .
For a list of all locations and their supported regions, see
All colocation facilities .
For a list of locations that you can use to connect your sites to each other, see
Colocation facilties for Cross-Site Interconnect .
Note: 100-Gbps circuits are not available in all
Cloud Interconnect locations. To find out if a location is
supported, contact your sales representative.
When using Partner Interconnect, partners have already set
up connections to Google's network. The set of locations varies, depending
on which partner you choose. When you set up your VLAN attachment, you can
select from the partner's available locations. For a list of locations
that each service provider supports, see the
service providers page.
When using Cross-Cloud Interconnect, you must choose a
location that your remote cloud service
provider supports:
Locations for Amazon Web Services
Locations for Microsoft Azure
Locations for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
Locations for Alibaba Cloud
Each partner location supports a subset of Google Cloud regions.
These supported regions are where you can connect to your Cloud Routers
and associated VLAN attachments. For example, if you choose the
Ashburn location, you can reach all the North American
regions, such as us-east1 and us-west1 . For a
list of Google Cloud regions, see the Regions and zones
page.
service provider
Applies to Partner Interconnect.
A network service provider for Partner Interconnect. To use
Partner Interconnect, you must connect to a supported
service provider . The service provider provides connectivity between
your on-premises network and your VPC network.
metropolitan area (metro)
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect,
Partner Interconnect,
Cross-Cloud Interconnect, and Cross-Site Interconnect.
The city where a colocation facility is located.
The metro that you choose depends on the location of your on-premises
network and the location of your Compute Engine VM instances
(their Google Cloud region) if you are connecting to Google Cloud.
Typically, you might want to pick a
metro that's geographically close to your on-premises network to reduce
latency. When configuring a redundant connection, you might choose an
additional metro that is further away.
For VLAN attachments, each metro supports a subset of Google Cloud regions.
You can create VLAN attachments only in these supported regions. For example, if you pick
a facility in Ashburn , you can only create VLAN attachments
in the North American regions. Assuming that your VM instances are also
located in these regions, you can create VLAN attachments in the same
regions as your VMs to reduce latency and outbound data transfer costs.
Otherwise, traffic would have to travel between regions to reach your VM
instances or on-premises network.
For more information for Dedicated Interconnect, see
All colocation facilities .
For more information for Cross-Site Interconnect, see
Colocation facilties for Cross-Site Interconnect .
metro availability zone
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect,
Partner Interconnect,
Cross-Cloud Interconnect, and Cross-Site Interconnect.
An older term for edge availability
domain.
edge availability domain
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect,
Partner Interconnect,
Cross-Cloud Interconnect, and Cross-Site Interconnect.
Each metropolitan area has two independent maintenance
domains called edge availability domains . The two edge availability
domains are named zone1 and zone2 . These domains
provide isolation during scheduled maintenance, which means that two
domains in the same metro are not down for maintenance at the same time.
This isolation is important when you're building for redundancy.
Edge availability domains span a whole metro, and do not cross metros. To
maintain availability and an
SLA ,
you must build duplicate Cloud Interconnect connections by
picking two connection locations in the same
metro that are in different edge availability domains. Some metros offer
more than two locations, but there are still only two edge availability
domains in the metro. For example, building connections in locations
dfw-zone1-4 and dfw-zone1-505 does not provide
redundancy because both locations are in the zone1 edge
availability domain. Building them in dfw-zone1-4 and
dfw-zone2-4 provides redundancy because the locations are in
different edge availability domains.
Maintenance windows are not coordinated across metros. For example, the
edge availability domains dfw-zone1-4 and
ord-zone1-7 could experience overlapping maintenance events.
When connecting to multiple metros for redundancy, it is important to
connect to different edge availability domains in each of those metros, as
described in the
production topology .
Provisioning and configuration
Letter of Authorization and Connecting Facility Assignment (LOA-CFA)
Applies to Dedicated Interconnect and Cross-Site Interconnect.
An
LOA-CFA identifies the connection ports that Google has assigned for
your Cloud Interconnect connection, and grants
permission for a vendor in a colocation facility to connect to them.
LOA-CFA documents are required when you order
Dedicated Interconnect connections in a colocation
facility.
When you order Cloud Interconnect connections, Google
allocates resources for your connections and then generates an LOA-CFA
document for each one. The LOA-CFA lists the demarcation points that
Google allocated for your connections. Submit this form to the facility
vendor to provision connections between Google's equipment and your own.
After the status of a connection changes to PROVISIONED , the
LOA-CFA is no longer valid, necessary, or available in the
Google Cloud console.
For more information about the provisioning flow, see
Dedicated Interconnect provisioning overview
or Cross-Site Interconnect provisioning overview .
pairing key
Applies to Partner Interconnect.
A unique identifier that lets service providers identify particular VLAN
attachments without anyone sharing potentially sensitive information about
their VPC network or Google Cloud project. Pairing keys are
used only for Partner Interconnect.
Treat the pairing key as sensitive information until your VLAN attachment
is configured. If it's discovered, it's possible for other parties to use
it to connect to your network. The key is for one-time use and can't be
modified. If you need a new pairing key, delete your VLAN attachment and
create a new one.
Pairing keys use the following format:
<random>/<vlan-attachment-region>/<edge-availability-domain> .
For example,
7e51371e-72a3-40b5-b844-2e3efefaee59/us-central1/2
is a pairing key for a VLAN attachment in the
us-central1 region and edge availability domain
2 .
remote cloud service provider
Applies to Cross-Cloud Interconnect.
Another cloud service provider, in addition to Google Cloud, where
you might have networking resources.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) terms
The following terminology applies to the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) ,
which Cloud VPN and Cloud Interconnect use for dynamic routing.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
An exterior gateway routing protocol standardized by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) in RFC 1722 .
BGP automatically exchanges routing and reachability information among autonomous
systems on the internet. Your device is BGP-capable if it can perform BGP
routing, which means that you can enable the BGP protocol on it and assign it a
BGP IP address and an autonomous system number. To determine if your
device supports BGP, see the vendor information for your device or contact your device's vendor.
autonomous system (AS)
A collection of connected IP routing prefixes under the control of a single
administrative entity or domain that presents a common routing policy to the
internet, such as an internet service provider (ISP), a large company,
or a university.
autonomous system number (ASN)
A unique identifier allocated to each autonomous system that uses BGP routing.
For more information, see
RFC 7300 .
MD5 authentication
A method of BGP peer authentication that uses the MD5 message-digest algorithm. When you
use this approach, BGP peers must use the same authentication key, or a connection cannot be
established between them. Later, every segment routed between the peers is verified. For
more information about MD5 authentication, see
RFC 2385 . To
find out whether your device supports MD5 authentication, see the vendor information for the
device or contact the vendor. To get support with using Cloud Router MD5 authentication,
see Support .
