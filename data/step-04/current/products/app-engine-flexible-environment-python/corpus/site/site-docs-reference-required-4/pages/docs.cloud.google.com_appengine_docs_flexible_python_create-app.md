Create a Python app in the App Engine flexible environment
Region ID
The REGION_ID is an abbreviated code that Google assigns
based on the region you select when you create your app. The code does not
correspond to a country or province, even though some region IDs may appear
similar to commonly used country and province codes. For apps created after
February 2020, REGION_ID .r is included in
App Engine URLs. For existing apps created before this date, the
region ID is optional in the URL.

about region IDs .
OK
Note: If you are deploying a new Python web service to Google Cloud,
we recommend getting started with
Cloud Run .
This quickstart demonstrates how to create and deploy an app that displays a
short message. You can
use the sample application in this quickstart for any supported version of Python, by specifying the runtime version and operating system in your
app.yaml file.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Cloud Build API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.

Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to complete this quickstart,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
App Engine Admin ( roles/appengine.appAdmin )
on the project
Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor )
on the project
Storage Object Admin ( roles/storage.objectAdmin )
on the project
Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer )
on the project
Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser )
on the service account
Ask your administrator to grant the following roles for the App Engine default service account:
Artifact Registry Reader ( roles/artifactregistry.reader )
on the project
Cloud Build Service Account ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder )
on the project
Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer )
on the project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Additional prerequisites
Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
gcloud app create -- project = [ YOUR_PROJECT_ID ]
When prompted, select the region
where you want to locate your App Engine application.
Caution : You cannot change an app's region
once it has been set.
Install the following on your local machine:
Download
and install Git .
Run the following command to install the
gcloud component that includes the
App Engine extension for Python:
gcloud components install app - engine - python
Prepare your environment for Python development. It is recommended that you
have the latest version of Python, pip , and other related tools
installed on your system. For instructions, refer to the
Python Development Environment Setup Guide .
App Engine locations
App Engine is regional , which means the infrastructure that runs your apps is
located in a specific region, and Google manages it so that it is available
redundantly across
all of the zones within that region .
Meeting your latency, availability, or durability requirements are primary
factors for selecting the region where your apps are run. You can generally
select the region nearest to your app's users, but you should consider the
locations where App Engine is available
as well as the locations of the other
Google Cloud products and services that your app uses. Using services
across multiple locations can affect your app's latency as well as its
pricing .
You cannot change an app's region after you set it.
Note: Two locations, which are called europe-west and
us-central in App Engine commands and in the Google Cloud console,
are called europe-west1 and us-central1 , respectively,
elsewhere in Google documentation.
If you already created an App Engine application, you can view its
region by doing one of the following:
Run the gcloud app describe command.
Open the
App Engine Dashboard in the Google Cloud console .
The region appears near the top of the page.
OK
This quickstart demonstrates the latest Python 3 app written with the
Flask
web framework that can be deployed to App Engine. Although this sample
uses Flask, you can use any web framework that satisfies the requirements above.
Alternative frameworks include
Django ,
Pyramid ,
Bottle , and
web.py .
Download the Hello World app
We've created a Hello World app for App Engine so you can quickly
get a feel for deploying an app to the Google Cloud.
Clone the Hello World sample app repository to your local machine.
git clone https : // github . com / GoogleCloudPlatform / python - docs - samples
Alternatively, you can download the sample as a zip file and extract it.
Change to the directory that contains the sample code.
cd python - docs - samples / appengine / flexible / hello_world
Run Hello World on your local machine
To run the Hello World app on your local computer:
Mac OS / Linux
Note: These instructions describe how to set up a virtual environment in Python 3. For Python 2
apps, use virtualenv to set up a virtual environment.
Create an
isolated Python environment :
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
If you're not in the directory that contains the sample code, navigate
to the directory that contains the hello_world sample code. Then install
dependencies:
cd YOUR_SAMPLE_CODE_DIR
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
python main.py
In your web browser, enter the following address:
http://localhost:8080
If you are using Cloud Shell, in the toolbar, click
Web Preview and select
Preview on port 8080 instead.
Windows
Note: These instructions describe how to set up a virtual environment in Python 3. For Python 2
apps, use virtualenv to set up a virtual environment.
Use
PowerShell to run your Python packages.
Locate your installation of
PowerShell .
Right-click on the shortcut to PowerShell and start it as an administrator.
Create an
isolated Python environment .
python -m venv env
. \e nv \S cripts \a ctivate
Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies. If you're not in the directory
that contains the sample code, navigate to the directory that contains the
hello_world sample code. Then, install dependencies:
cd YOUR_SAMPLE_CODE_DIR
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
python main.py
In your web browser, enter the following address:
http://localhost:8080
The Hello World message from the sample app displays on the page. In your
terminal window, press Ctrl+C to exit the web server.
Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
To deploy your app to the App Engine
flexible environment:
Deploy the Hello World app by running the following
command from the hello_world directory:
gcloud app deploy
Learn about the
optional flags .
Common gcloud command flags
Include the --version flag to specify an ID that uniquely
identifies that version of your app, otherwise one is generated for you.
Example: --version [YOUR_VERSION_ID]
Include the --project flag to specify an alternate
Google Cloud project ID to what you initialized as the
default in the gcloud tool. Example:
--project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
Example:
gcloud app deploy --version pre-prod-5 --project my-sample-app
To learn more about deploying your app from the command line, see
Testing and Deploying Your App
. For a list of all the command flags, see the
gcloud app deploy
reference.
OK
Launch your browser to view the app at
https:// PROJECT_ID . REGION_ID .r.appspot.com
gcloud app browse where
PROJECT_ID represents your Google Cloud
project ID.
This time, the page that displays the Hello World message is delivered by a
web server running on an App Engine instance.
Congratulations! You've deployed your first App Engine app to the
App Engine flexible environment!
If you encountered any errors deploying your application, check the
troubleshooting tips .
See the following sections for information about cleaning up as well as links to
possible next steps that you can take.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges, you can delete your Google Cloud project to stop
billing for all the resources used within that project.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
What's next
Learn the whole platform
Now that you know what it's like to develop and deploy App Engine apps,
you can explore the rest of Google Cloud. You already have the
Google Cloud CLI installed which gives you the tools to interact with
products like Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Firestore,
and more.
Learn about the App Engine flexible environment
Here are some topics to help continue your learning about App Engine:
An overview of App Engine
Request routing
Request handling
Managing instances
Hello World code review
Hello World is the simplest possible App Engine app, as it contains only
one service, has only one version, and all of the code is located within the
app's root directory. This section describes each of the app files in detail.
main.py
The Hello World app is a basic one-file Flask app.
from flask import Flask
app = Flask ( __name__ )
@app . route ( "/" )
def hello () - > str :
"""Return a friendly HTTP greeting.
Returns:
A string with the words 'Hello World!'.
"""
return "Hello World!"
if __name__ == "__main__" :
# This is used when running locally only. When deploying to Google App
# Engine, a webserver process such as Gunicorn will serve the app.
app . run ( host = "127.0.0.1" , port = 8080 , debug = True )
app.yaml
The app.yaml
file describes the following configuration for your app:
Sets env: flex , indicating your app uses the
App Engine flexible environment .
Specifies the runtime used by the app. If you exclude the runtime_version setting, App Engine uses the latest Python version as the default version for your app.
The entrypoint tells App Engine how to start the app. This app uses
gunicorn to serve
the Python app as an alternative to Flask's
development server
(used when running locally). The $PORT variable is set by App Engine when it starts
the app. For more information about entrypoint , see App
startup .
Note: This is the simplest way to get gunicorn running. However this approach
runs the application with a single blocking worker, which means all HTTP requests
are handled in serial, including health checks. In practice, this results in
the application becoming unresponsive in the event of slow requests. For more
details on how to configure gunicorn for production, see
Recommended gunicorn configuration
