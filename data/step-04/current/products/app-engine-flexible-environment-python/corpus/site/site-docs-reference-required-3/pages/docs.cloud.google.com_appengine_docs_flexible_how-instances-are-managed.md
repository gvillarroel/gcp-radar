How instances are managed
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Instances are the computing units that App Engine uses to automatically
scale your
application .
At any given time, your application can be running on one instance or many
instances, with requests being spread across all of them.
Your instances with manual scaling should run indefinitely, but
there is no uptime guarantee as instances can get early termination due to failures or restart for the updates. Hardware or software failures that cause early
termination or frequent restarts can occur without warning and can take
considerable time to resolve.
All flexible instances may be restarted on a weekly basis
if there are updates available. This schedule is not guaranteed.
During restarts,
critical, backwards-compatible updates are automatically rolled out to the
underlying operating system. Your application's image will remain the same
across restarts.
Health checking
App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance
is running, and to check that an instance is fully
started and ready to accept incoming requests. By default, these health checks
are enabled and are known as split health checks . An instance that receives
a health check must answer the health check within a specified time interval.
If you need to extend the default behavior of split health checks to your
application, you can customize the app.yaml file to configure two types of health checks:
Liveness checks detect that a VM instance and its container are
running. When a VM instance fails the liveness check, the instance is
restarted automatically. Liveness checks can fail due to the configured
thresholds and time intervals, or due to the container crashing.
Readiness checks detect that a VM instance is ready to accept incoming
requests. If a VM instance fails the readiness check, it means that the VM
instance has not finished its startup and is not ready to receive requests.
When the VM instance passes the readiness check and has completed its
startup, it is added to the pool of available instances.
Learn more about split health check behaviors in the Migrating to Split Health Checks guide.
As the instance goes through these health checks, the
App Engine logs can indicate that the
instance is in any of the following states:
Healthy . The instance received the health check requests and is processing
the requests. A healthy status indicates that the instance has more than
820 MB of available disk space and should respond to a health check with
an HTTP status code of 200 .
Unhealthy . The instance refused the health check requests and failed
to respond to a specified number of consecutive health check requests.
App Engine continues to send health check requests and
restarts the instance if an unhealthy instance continues to fail to respond
to a predetermined number of consecutive health checks.
Lameduck . The instance is scheduled to be shut down or restarted.
During shutdowns, the instance finishes up ongoing requests, and refuses new
requests. The app returns a 503 code to indicate that the instance is
unable to handle requests. Before an instance shuts down or restarts, the
shutdown script has a limited time period to run, and cannot be configured
to be shorter or longer.
App Lameduck . The instance is preparing to serve traffic. The app
returns a 503 code to indicate that the instance is unable to handle
requests. When a VM instance has completed startup and is ready to
serve traffic, the instance will become healthy and process requests. If a
VM instance does not start up in time, the instance changes to unhealthy
and gets removed.
Both lameduck and app lameduck behaviors are part of a normal process that the
VM instance goes through.
Monitoring resource usage
The Instances page of the Google Cloud console provides visibility into how your instances are performing. You can see the memory and CPU usage of each instance, uptime, number of requests, and other statistics. You can also manually initiate the shutdown process for any instance.
NTP with App Engine flexible environment
The App Engine flexible environment has network time protocol (NTP) services which use Google NTP
servers. However, the NTP services in the flexible environment is not editable.
Instance location
Instances are automatically located by geographical region according to the
project settings .
Instance scaling
While an application is running, incoming requests are routed to an existing or
new instance of the appropriate service/version. Each active version must have
at least one instance running, and the scaling type of a service/version
controls how additional instances are created.
You specify the scaling type in your app's
app.yaml .
By default, your app uses automatic scaling, which means App Engine will
manage the number of idle instances.
Automatic scaling
Automatic scaling creates instances based on request rate, response latencies,
and other application metrics. You can specify thresholds for each of these
metrics, as well as a minimum number instances to keep running at all times
by configuring the automatic_scaling element.
Manual scaling
Manual scaling specifies the number of instances that continuously run
regardless of the load level. This allows tasks such as complex initializations
and applications that rely on the state of the memory over time.
Manage services
Depending on the scaling type of your instance, you can manage
services and versions in the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI.
Stop a version
Each version in App Engine runs within one or more instances, depending
on how much traffic you configured it to handle.
Click the tab for instructions on using the tool of your choice:
Console
To stop or disable a version for your service:
Go to the App Engine Versions page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to Versions
Select a version from the table, and click Stop .
gcloud
Run the following:
gcloud app versions stop --service= SERVICE VERSION
Replace:
SERVICE with the name of your service.
VERSION with the version name of your service.
Delete a service
Each service can be configured to use different runtimes and to operate with
different performance settings. You can't delete the default service. Deleting a
service also deletes all of its accompanying versions in your project.
Click the tab for instructions on using the tool of your choice:
Console
To delete a service:
Go to the App Engine Services page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to Services
Select a service from the table, and click Delete .
gcloud
Run the following:
gcloud app services delete SERVICE
Replace:
SERVICE with the name of your service.
