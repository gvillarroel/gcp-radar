Manage App Engine costs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
With App Engine, you only pay for the resources that you use beyond the
free quotas . After you exceed the free quotas, your costs
scale with the amount of traffic that your application receives.
To limit the costs of your App Engine app, you can use any of the
following mechanisms:
Specify the maximum number of instances
Create budget alerts
Disable your app manually
Disable your app programmatically
Specify the maximum number of instances
Since App Engine costs usually scale based on the amount of traffic your
app receives, you can limit your costs by limiting the
number of instances
App Engine can create.
Setting the maximum to 1 instance usually keeps your instance hour usage within
the free tier. However, setting the maximum too low may prevent your app from
having enough instances to adequately serve incoming requests .
To specify the maximum number of instances, use the max_instances
setting
in your app's app.yaml file.
Important: App Engine applies the max_instances setting on a best effort
basis. In some circumstances, App Engine may briefly exceed the limit
you specify.
Create budget alerts
Budget alerts send a notification when your costs rise above a threshold you
specify. When you receive a notification, you can limit costs by lowering the
value of the max_instances setting or disabling your app .
To get started with budget alerts, see Set budget alerts .
Select the scope of a budget alert
You can create budget alerts for the total cost of all Google Cloud services
in one or more projects, or just for the cost of App Engine.
To create a budget alert just for costs from
App Engine, in the Budget alert's Products field, select App Engine .
The alert will trigger when the total cost from all App Engine resources
exceed the amount you specify, including:
Instance hours in the App Engine standard environment
Instance hours and RAM in the App Engine flexible environment
Bundled App Engine services
For the full list of billable App Engine resources, see
App Engine SKUs .
Disable your app manually
Disabling your app temporarily stops it from serving and incurring billing
charges related to serving your app. All of your app's data and configuration
settings remain unchanged, and when you are ready to start running your app
again, you can enable it.
While the app is disabled, requests to your app will fail. You may continue to
incur charges from other Google Cloud products. For example, if your project
has exceeded the free quota for
Cloud Storage , you will continue
to incur charges for storage.
For more information, see
Disable an app .
Disable your app programmatically
You can use Budget Alerts, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Run functions to
automatically disable your app when your costs exceed a threshold you specify.
As with manually disabling an app:
All of your app's data and configuration settings remain unchanged.
When you are ready to start running your app again, you can enable it.
Requests to your app will fail while the app is disabled.
You may continue to incur charges from other Google Cloud products while
your app is disabled.
Important: With this programmatic approach, you may pay more than the amount you
specify in your budget alert. Because of the delay between the time a resource
is used and the time it is billed, additional costs may be incurred before all
services are stopped.
To programmatically disable your app:
Create a budget alert that sends a notification to a Pub/Sub
topic. For details, see Manage programmatic
notifications .
To create a budget alert just for costs from App Engine, in the
Budget's Products field, select App Engine . For information about the
resources that can trigger this alert, see
Create budget alerts .
In Cloud Run functions create a function that is triggered by the
Pub/Sub topic. For details, see Create a Cloud
Function .
When creating the function:
Use the following source code:
Note: The source code assumes that the function you are creating and the
app you want to disable are in the same Google Cloud project. If the
function and the app are in separate projects , change the source
code so APP_NAME identifies the project that contains the
app you want to disable .
import base64
import json
import os
from googleapiclient import discovery
APP_NAME = os . getenv ( "GCP_PROJECT" )
def limit_use_appengine ( data , context ):
pubsub_data = base64 . b64decode ( data [ "data" ]) . decode ( "utf-8" )
pubsub_json = json . loads ( pubsub_data )
cost_amount = pubsub_json [ "costAmount" ]
budget_amount = pubsub_json [ "budgetAmount" ]
if cost_amount < = budget_amount :
print ( f "No action necessary. (Current cost: { cost_amount } )" )
return
appengine = discovery . build ( "appengine" , "v1" , cache_discovery = False )
apps = appengine . apps ()
# Get the target app's serving status
target_app = apps . get ( appsId = APP_NAME ) . execute ()
current_status = target_app [ "servingStatus" ]
# Disable target app, if necessary
if current_status == "SERVING" :
print ( f "Attempting to disable app { APP_NAME } ..." )
body = { "servingStatus" : "USER_DISABLED" }
apps . patch ( appsId = APP_NAME , updateMask = "serving_status" , body = body ) . execute ()
Add the following dependencies to your function's requirements.txt file:
google-api-python-client==2.131.0
Under Function to execute enter limit_use_appengine .
Click Environment variables, networking, timeouts and more .
Select a service account that has the App Engine Admin role.
The App Engine default service
account has this role
by default.
Test the function .
When the budget alert is triggered, an email is sent to users in your
Cloud Billing account , and
your function starts disabling your app. It may take few minutes to complete
this process.
To verify that the function ran successfully, view the App Engine
dashboard. A message appears near the top to indicate that your app is disabled.
Go to the App Engine dashboard
When you want your app to continue serving requests, go to
Application settings and click Enable application .
Go to Application settings
