Communicating between your services

Region ID
The REGION_ID is an abbreviated code that Google assigns
based on the region you select when you create your app. The code does not
correspond to a country or province, even though some region IDs may appear
similar to commonly used country and province codes. For apps created after
February 2020, REGION_ID .r is included in
App Engine URLs. For existing apps created before this date, the
region ID is optional in the URL.

You can use various methods to communicate between your App Engine
services or with other services, including Google Cloud services and
external applications.
The simplest approach for communicating with your App Engine service is
to send targeted HTTP requests, where the URL includes the name or ID of a
resource. For example, you can include the ID of a service or version that you
want to target, in addition to the corresponding Google Cloud project ID:
https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT_ID . REGION_ID .r.appspot.com
Note that the combined length of
VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT_ID , where
VERSION is the name of your version, SERVICE
is the name of your service, and PROJECT_ID is your
project ID, cannot be longer than 63 characters and cannot start or end with
a hyphen. If the combined length is
longer than 63 characters, you might see Error DNS address could not be
found.

Using user-managed service accounts
Your App Engine services can also communicate using
Pub/Sub , which provides reliable asynchronous
many-to-many messaging between processes, including App Engine. These
processes can be individual instances of your application, services, or even
external applications.
To share data across databases and your App Engine app or some other
external application, see
Understanding Data and File Storage .
Private Communication
Communication between services in the same project
You can allow an App Engine flexible service to communicate with
another App Engine service in the same project without having to expose
the destination service to the public internet.
Configure the destination service's
ingress settings
to allow "internal" traffic only.
Ensure the source app version is not deployed to a Shared VPC network
located in a different project.
Communication between services in different projects
You can have private access between Google Cloud projects when apps running
in projects belong to a Shared VPC network that is
configured to invoke an app running in the Shared VPC network's host project.
To use this pattern, follow the previous steps for
communicating between services in the same project .
In the flexible environment, deploy
each client version to the same Shared VPC network.
Other methods of communication between projects using internal access are not
possible in App Engine.
Reserved URL paths
It is not possible to use the following URL paths:
Paths ending with /eventlog
Paths starting with /_ah/
Some paths ending with z
