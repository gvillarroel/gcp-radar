Update clusters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
After you create a cluster, you can change some aspects of the cluster's
configuration. For example you can:
Add, remove, or replace nodes.
Add or remove annotations to the cluster.
Modify the values of mutable fields in the cluster and node pool resources.
Modify other custom resources.
You can use bmctl or the Google Cloud CLI to make updates to a cluster. If you
created an admin or user cluster using Terraform, then you can use Terraform to
update the cluster. Note the following:
Many aspects of your cluster configuration are immutable and can't be updated
after you create your cluster. For a comprehensive list of mutable and
immutable fields, see the
Cluster configuration field reference . The field reference is a
sortable table. Click the column headings to change the sort order. Click a
field name to view its description.
The gcloud CLI and Terraform only support updating admin and user
clusters. You have to use bmctl to update other cluster types.
The gcloud CLI and Terraform only support changes to the
cluster and node pool resources. You have to use kubectl or bmctl to
update other custom resources that affect the cluster.
Modifying the namespace of an existing cluster in the cluster configuration
file is not a supported operation and can lead to cluster
instability and potential failures. To avoid these issues, don't attempt to
modify the cluster namespace after its creation.
This page is for Admins and architects and Operators who manage the
lifecycle of the underlying tech infrastructure. To learn more about common
roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see Common
GKE user roles and
tasks .
How to update clusters
Generally, you do the following sequence of actions to update a cluster:
bmctl
Change the values of the applicable fields in the cluster's configuration
file, which by default is located here:
bmctl-workspace/CLUSTER-NAME/CLUSTER-NAME.yaml
Update the cluster by running the bmctl update command:
bmctl update cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME --kubeconfig = KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster you want to
update.
KUBECONFIG : for admin, hybrid, or standalone
clusters, enter the path to the cluster's kubeconfig file. For a user
cluster, enter the path to the admin cluster's kubeconfig file.
Don't use bmctl update and kubectl apply -f
interchangeably when editing the cluster configuration file. When these
commands are used interchangeably, contents populated by the header of the
cluster spec might be unintentionally removed. For example, you might use
bmctl update to update the cluster configuration file to
configure a registry mirror .
The cluster then has spec.nodeConfig.registryMirrors populated
after reconciliation.
If you then attempt to make changes to the cluster using the cluster
configuration with the kubectl apply -f command, the
spec.nodeConfig.registryMirrors populated by the reconciler
on the cluster is removed. This behavior happens because the configuration
doesn't exist in the cluster configuration spec, but it does in the cluster.
gcloud CLI
Specify only the flags for the configuration that you want to modify.
Run the applicable update command:
Admin clusters:
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters update
User clusters:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters update .
Node pools on a user cluster:
gcloud container bare-metal node-pools update
Terraform
Change the values of the applicable fields in the Terraform
configuration file that you used to create the cluster or node pool. See
the Terraform reference documentation for detailed field descriptions:
google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_admin_cluster
google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_cluster
google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_node_pool
Update the configuration by running the terraform apply command.
The following sections outline some common examples for updating an existing
cluster.
Add or remove nodes in a cluster
A node pool is a group of
nodes within a cluster that have the same configuration. Keep in mind that a
node always belongs to a node pool. To add a new node to a cluster, you need
to add it to a particular node pool. Removing a node from a node pool amounts
to removing the node from the cluster altogether.
There are three kinds of node pools in Google Distributed Cloud: control plane, load
balancer, and worker node pools. The following sections describe how to
add or remove nodes from each kind of node pool.
bmctl
You add or remove a node from a node pool by adding or removing the IP address
of the node in a specific section of the cluster configuration file. The
following list shows which section to edit for a given node pool:
Worker node pool: add or remove the IP address of the node in the
spec.nodes section of the NodePool spec.
Control plane node pool: add or remove the IP address of the node in the
spec.controlPlane.nodePoolSpec.nodes section of the Cluster spec.
Load balancer node pool: add or remove the IP address of the node in the
spec.loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec.nodes section of the Cluster spec.
Example: remove a worker node
Here's a sample cluster configuration file that shows the specifications of
two worker nodes:
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : NodePool
metadata :
name : nodepool1
namespace : cluster-cluster1
spec :
clusterName : cluster1
nodes :
- address : 192.0.2.1
- address : 192.0.2.2
To remove a node:
(Optional) If the node that you're removing is running critical Pods,
first put the node into maintenance mode .
You can monitor the node draining process for worker nodes by viewing the
status.nodesDrained and status.nodesDraining fields on the
NodePool resource.
Edit the cluster configuration file to delete the IP address entry for the
node.
Update the cluster:
bmctl update cluster1 \
--kubeconfig = ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
gcloud CLI
You use an update command to add or remove nodes. The update command that
you use and the flag in which you specify the IP address depends on the type
of node pool that you want to update:
Worker node pool: Run gcloud container bare-metal node-pools update and
specify the IP address in the flag
--node-configs 'node-ip= IP_ADDRESS ' .
Control plane node pool on an admin cluster: Run
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters update and specify the IP
address in the flag
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip= IP_ADDRESS ' .
Control plane node pool on a user cluster: Run
gcloud container bare-metal clusters update and specify the IP
address in the flag
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip= IP_ADDRESS ' .
Load balancer node pool: Run
gcloud container bare-metal clusters update and specify the IP
address in the flag
--metal-lb-load-balancer-node-configs 'node-ip= IP_ADDRESS '
or
--bgp-load-balancer-node-configs 'node-ip= IP_ADDRESS '
The flag in which you specify the IP address only accepts one node-ip . You
include the flag for each IP address in the node pool.
The update commands replace all IP addresses with the IP addresses that
you specify. To add a node, include the IP addresses of the existing
nodes and the IP address of the new node in the update command. Similarly,
you remove nodes by only including the IP addresses of the nodes that you
want to keep.
Example: remove a worker node
This section shows how to remove a worker node from a node pool using
example data. Additional gcloud CLI commands that you might
find useful are also included in the following steps.
(Optional) If the node that you're removing is running critical Pods,
first put the node into maintenance mode .
You can monitor the node draining process for worker nodes by viewing the
status.nodesDrained and status.nodesDraining fields on the
NodePool resource.
Run the list command to list all the node pools in the cluster:
gcloud container bare-metal node-pools list \
--cluster=abm-user-cluster1 \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1
The output is similar to the following:
NAME LOCATION STATE
node-pool-1 us-central1 RUNNING
node-pool-2 asia-east1 RUNNING
Run the describe command to list all the IP addresses in the node pool:
gcloud container bare-metal node-pools describe node-pool-1 \
--cluster=abm-user-cluster1 \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1
The following example output is truncated for readability:
annotations:
...
baremetal.cluster.gke.io/version: 1.34
...
name: projects/example-project-12345/locations/us-central1/bareMetalClusters/abm-user-cluster1/bareMetalNodePools/node-pool-1
nodePoolConfig:
nodeConfigs:
- nodeIp: 192.0.2.1
- nodeIp: 192.0.2.2
operatingSystem: LINUX
state: RUNNING
...
Note the following in the example output:
The name field contains the fully-qualified name of the node pool.
When specifying the node pool name in a command, you can either specify
the fully-qualified name, or the node pool name, for example,
node-pool-1 , along with the --cluster , --project , and the
--location flags.
The nodeConfigs section contains two nodeIp fields with the IP
addresses of the nodes.
Run the following command to remove the node with the IP address
192.0.2.1:
gcloud container bare-metal node-pools update node-pool-1 \
--cluster=abm-user-cluster1 \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1 \
--node-configs='node-ip=192.0.2.2'
The update command replaces all IP addresses with the IP addresses that
you specify. Because 192.0.2.1 isn't included, the node is removed.
The output of the command is similar to the following:
Waiting for operation [projects/example-project-12345/locations/us-central1/operations/operation-1697154681749-6078d9def4030-76686d6e-9fcb1de9] to complete
In the example output, the string operation-1697154681749-6078d9def4030-76686d6e-9fcb1de9
is the OPERATION_ID of the long-running operation.
You can find out the status of the operation by running the following
command in another terminal window:
gcloud container bare-metal operations describe operation-1697154681749-6078d9def4030-76686d6e-9fcb1de9 \
--project= example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1
You can rerun the command every so often to check the status.
If the node removal fails, you can force its removal from the cluster.
For details, see
Reset a failed node in Google Distributed Cloud .
Replace HA control plane nodes
bmctl
You can use bmctl to replace high availability (HA) control plane nodes in
all cluster types.
You replace a node in a cluster by performing the following steps:
Remove the node's IP address from the cluster configuration file.
Update the cluster.
Check the status of nodes in the cluster.
Add a new node's IP address to the same cluster configuration file.
Update the cluster.
Example: replace a HA control plane node
Here's a sample cluster configuration file that shows three control plane
nodes in a user cluster:
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : user-cluster
namespace : cluster-user-cluster
spec :
controlPlane :
nodePoolSpec :
nodes :
- address : 192.0.2.11
- address : 192.0.2.12
- address : 192.0.2.13
To replace the last node listed in the spec.controlPlane.nodePoolSpec.nodes
section, perform the following steps:
Remove the node by deleting its IP address entry in the cluster
configuration file. After making this change, the cluster configuration file
should look something like this:
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : user-cluster
namespace : cluster-user-cluster
spec :
controlPlane :
nodePoolSpec :
nodes :
- address : 192.0.2.11
- address : 192.0.2.12
Update the cluster by running the following command:
bmctl update cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig= KUBECONFIG
Make the following changes:
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name of the cluster you want to
update.
If the cluster is a self-managing cluster (such as admin or standalone
cluster), replace KUBECONFIG with the path to the cluster's
kubeconfig file. If the cluster is a user cluster, as it is in this
example, replace KUBECONFIG with the path to the admin
cluster's kubeconfig file.
After the bmctl update command has executed successfully, it takes some
time to complete the machine-preflight and machine-init jobs. You can
view the status of nodes and their respective node pools by running the
commands described in the Verify your updates section
of this document. After the node pool and nodes are in a ready state, you
can proceed to the next step.
Add a new control plane node to the node pool by adding the IP address of
the new control plane node to the spec.controlPlane.nodePoolSpec.nodes
section of the cluster configuration file. After making this change, the
cluster configuration file should look something like this:
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : user-cluster
namespace : cluster-user-cluster
spec :
controlPlane :
nodePoolSpec :
nodes :
- address : 192.0.2.11
- address : 192.0.2.12
- address : 192.0.2.14
Update the cluster by running the following command:
bmctl update cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig= KUBECONFIG
gcloud CLI
You can use the gcloud CLI to replace high availability (HA)
control plane nodes in admin and user clusters.
You replace a node in a cluster by performing the following steps:
Remove the node's IP address by running the applicable update command:
User cluster: gcloud container bare-metal clusters update
Admin cluster: gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters update
Check the status of the node removal in the cluster by running
gcloud container bare-metal operations describe OPERATION_ID .
Add the new node's IP address by running the applicable update command.
Example: replace a HA control plane node
This section shows how to replace a control plane from a cluster using
example data. Additional gcloud CLI commands that you might
find useful are also included in the following steps.
Run the list command to list all the user clusters in a
Google Cloud project:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters list \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=-
When you set --location=- , that means to list all clusters in all
regions. If you need to scope down the list, set --location to a
specific region .
The output is similar to the following:
NAME LOCATION VERSION ADMIN_CLUSTER STATE
abm-user-cluster1a us-central1 1.34 abm-admin-cluster1 RUNNING
abm-user-cluster1b europe-west1 1.34 abm-admin-cluster1 RUNNING
Run the describe command on the cluster:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters describe abm-user-cluster1 \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1
The example output is truncated for readability:
...
controlPlane:
controlPlaneNodePoolConfig:
nodePoolConfig:
nodeConfigs:
- nodeIp: 192.0.2.11
- nodeIp: 192.0.2.12
- nodeIp: 192.0.2.13
operatingSystem: LINUX
...
name: projects/example-project-1234567/locations/us-central1/bareMetalClusters/abm-user-cluster1a
...
Note the following in the example output:
The name field contains the fully-qualified name of the cluster.
When specifying the cluster name in a command, you can either specify
the fully-qualified name, or the cluster name, for example,
abm-user-cluster1a , along with the --project and the
--location flags .
The nodeConfigs section contains three nodeIp fields with the IP
addresses of the control plane nodes.
Remove the node with the IP address 192.0.2.13 :
gcloud container bare-metal cluster update abm-user-cluster1a \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1 \
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip=192.0.2.11'
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip=192.0.2.12'
The output of the command is similar to the following:
Waiting for operation [projects/example-project-12345/locations/us-central1/operations/operation-1956154681749-6078d9def4030-76686d6e-9fcb1d7] to complete
In the example output, the string operation-1956154681749-6078d9def4030-76686d6e-9fcb1de7
is the OPERATION_ID of the long-running operation.
You can find out the status of the operation by running the following
command in another terminal window:
gcloud container bare-metal operations describe operation-1956154681749-6078d9def4030-76686d6e-9fcb1de7 \
--project= example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1
You can rerun the command every so often to check the status.
Add the new node with the IP address 192.0.2.14 :
gcloud container bare-metal cluster update abm-user-cluster1a \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1 \
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip=192.0.2.11'
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip=192.0.2.12'
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip=192.0.2.14'
Verify your updates
kubectl
You can view the status of nodes and their respective node pools with the
kubectl get command.
For example, the following command shows the status of the node pools in the
cluster namespace cluster-my-cluster :
kubectl -n cluster-my-cluster get nodepools.baremetal.cluster.gke.io
The system returns results similar to the following:
NAME READY RECONCILING STALLED UNDERMAINTENANCE UNKNOWN
cluster-my-cluster 3 0 0 0 0
cluster-my-cluster-lb 2 0 0 0 0
np1 3 0 0 0 0
Reconciling=1 means that the reconciliation step is still in progress. You
should wait until the status changes to Reconciling=0 .
You can also check status of nodes in the a cluster by running following
command:
kubectl get nodes --kubeconfig = KUBECONFIG
gcloud CLI
As described previously, after running an update command, you can
check the status of the operation using gcloud container bare-metal
operations describe OPERATIONS_ID . The output of
the command gives the status of the nodes, for example:
...
metrics:
- intValue: '1'
metric: NODES_RECONCILING
- intValue: '2'
metric: NODES_HEALTHY
- intValue: '0'
metric: NODES_FAILED
- intValue: '0'
metric: NODES_IN_MAINTENANCE
- intValue: '3'
metric: NODES_TOTAL
stage: HEALTH_CHECK
...
No matter which tool you use to update a node pool, you can get the current
status of a node pool by running the applicable describe command as shown
previously.
If you need more information about how to diagnose your clusters, see
Create snapshots for diagnosing clusters .
Load balancer address pools
bmctl
The addressPools
section contains fields for specifying load-balancing pools for the MetalLB
and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) bundled load balancers. You can add more
load-balancing address pools at any time, but you can't remove any existing
address pools. Starting with Google Distributed Cloud version 1.16.0, you can
modify the values for addressPools.avoidBuggyIPs and
addressPools.manualAssign at any time.
addressPools :
- name : pool1
addresses :
- 198.51.100.0-198.51.100.4
- 198.51.100.240/28
- name : pool2
addresses :
- 198.51.100.224/28
gcloud CLI
You can add more load-balancing address pools at any time for the bundled
load balancers, but you can't remove any existing address pools. The flag that
you specify in gcloud container bare-metal clusters update to add an address
pool depends on the type of bundled load balancer:
MetalLB (layer 2): Use the --metal-lb-address-pools flag.
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): Use the --bgp-address-pools flag.
The value for the flags have the following format:
'pool= NAME ,avoid-buggy-ips= True|False ,manual-assign= True|False ,addresses= IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_1 ; IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_2 ;...' \
The value has segments that start with the keywords pool ,
avoid-buggy-ip , manual-assign , and addresses . Separate each segment
with a comma.
pool : A name of your choice for the pool.
avoid-buggy-ips : If you set this to True , the IP address management
(IPAM) controller won't assign IP addresses ending in .0 or .255 to
Services. This avoids the problem of buggy consumer devices mistakenly
dropping traffic sent to those special IP addresses. If not specified,
defaults to False . Starting with Google Distributed Cloud version 1.16.0,
you can modify this value in an existing address pool.
manual-assign : If you don't want the IPAM controller to
automatically assign IP addresses from this pool to Services, set
this to True . Then a developer can create a Service of type
LoadBalancer and manually specify one of the addresses from the
pool. If not specified, manual-assign is set to False .
Starting with Google Distributed Cloud version 1.16.0, you can modify
this value in an existing address pool.
In the list of addresses : Each address must be a range either in
CIDR or
hyphenated-range format. To specify a single IP address in a pool
(such as for the ingress VIP), use /32 in CIDR notation
(for example, 192.0.2.1/32).
Note the following syntax rules:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed.
Separate each IP address range with a semicolon.
You can specify more than one instance of the flag, as shown in the
following example:
--metal-lb-address-pools='pool=pool2,avoid-buggy-ips=False,manual-assign=True,addresses=198.51.100.0/30;198.51.100.64-198.51.100.72'
--metal-lb-address-pools='pool=pool3,avoid-buggy-ips=True,manual-assign=True,addresses=203.0.113.0/28'
For more information about load balancer address pools, see
loadBalancer.addressPools
in Configure bundled load balancing.
Prevent inadvertent cluster deletion
bmctl
If you add the baremetal.cluster.gke.io/prevent-deletion: "true" annotation
to your cluster configuration file, you are prevented from deleting the
cluster. For example, running kubectl delete cluster or bmctl reset
cluster produces an error.
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : ci-10c3c6f4d9c698e
namespace : cluster-ci-10c3c6f4d9c698e
annotations :
baremetal.cluster.gke.io/prevent-deletion : "true"
spec :
clusterNetwork :
gcloud CLI
If you specify the --add-annotations flag with the value
baremetal.cluster.gke.io/prevent-deletion="true" , you are prevented from
deleting the cluster. For example:
Add the annotation to prevent accidental cluster deletion:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters update abm-user-cluster1a \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1 \
--add-annotations=baremetal.cluster.gke.io/prevent-deletion="true"
Attempt to delete the user cluster:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters delete abm-user-cluster1a \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=us-central1 \
--force \
--allow-missing
The response from the command is similar to the following:
ERROR: (gcloud.container.bare-metal.clusters.delete) INVALID_ARGUMENT:
invalid request: admission webhook "vcluster.kb.io" denied the request:
annotations[baremetal.cluster.gke.io/prevent-deletion]: Invalid value:
"true": Annotation "baremetal.cluster.gke.io/prevent-deletion" should be
removed in order to delete this cluster
To remove the annotation, specify
--remove-annotations=baremetal.cluster.gke.io/prevent-deletion="true"
in the update command.
Bypass preflight checks
This feature is available only with bmctl update .
The default value of the
bypassPreflightCheck
field is false . If you set this field to true in the cluster configuration
file, the internal preflight checks are ignored when you apply resources to
existing clusters.
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : cluster1
namespace : cluster-cluster1
annotations :
baremetal.cluster.gke.io/private-mode : "true"
spec :
bypassPreflightCheck : true
Add or remove cluster administrators
bmctl
You can add or remove a user or service account as a cluster administrator
for a user cluster by specifying email addresses in the clusterSecurity.authorization.clusterAdmin.gcpAccounts
section of the cluster configuration file. The accounts are granted the
cluster-admin role on the cluster, providing full access to the cluster.
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : cluster1
namespace : cluster-cluster1
spec :
clusterSecurity :
authorization :
clusterAdmin :
gcpAccounts :
- alex@example.com
- hao@example.com
- my-sa@example-project-12345. iam.gserviceaccount.com
When updating a user cluster to add an account, be sure to include all
accounts in the list (both existing and new accounts) because bmctl update
overwrites the list with what you specify in the configuration file. To
remove an account, remove it from the cluster configuration file and run
bmctl update .
gcloud CLI
You can add or remove a user or service account as a cluster administrator
by specifying an email addresses in the --admin-users flag. The flag
accepts only one email address. To add multiple users, specify one account
in each flag, for example:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters update abm-user-cluster1a \
--project = example-project-12345 \
--location = us-central1 \
--admin-users = alex@example.com \
--admin-users = hao@example.com
--admin-users = my-sa@example-project-12345.iam.gserviceaccount.com
The update command overwrites the whole grant list. Specify all existing and
new users who you want to be cluster administrators.
Set a login user
You can specify a non-root username that you want to use for passwordless sudo
capability access to the node machines in your cluster. Your SSH key,
sshPrivateKeyPath ,
must work for the specified user. The cluster create and update operations check
that node machines can be accessed with the specified user and SSH key.
bmctl
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : cluster1
namespace : cluster-cluster1
annotations :
baremetal.cluster.gke.io/private-mode : "true"
spec :
nodeAccess :
loginUser : abm
gcloud CLI
You specify the user that you want to use to access node machines in the
--login-user flag, for example:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters update abm-user-cluster1a \
--project = example-project-12345 \
--location = us-central1 \
--login-user = abm
To enable passwordless sudo access for a user, follow these steps on each
cluster node machine:
Use sudo visudo to open the sudoers file for editing:
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers
The visudo command locks the sudoers file to prevent simultaneous edits
and validates the syntax of the file upon saving.
For your login user, add an entry to the sudoers file like the following:
USERNAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
Close and save the file.
To run commands with the privileges of your login user, run the following
command:
su - USERNAME
To verify that a password isn't required for your login user to run sudo
commands, run the following sudo command:
sudo ip a
Advanced networking
You configure advanced networking features in various custom resources after
the cluster is created. To use the custom resources and related networking
features, you must enable advanced networking when you create your cluster.
bmctl
Set clusterNetwork.advancedNetworking
to true in the cluster configuration when you create your cluster:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : cluster1
namespace : cluster-cluster1
spec :
clusterNetwork :
...
advancedNetworking : true
...
gcloud CLI
Include the --enable-advanced-networking flag in
the gcloud container bare-metal clusters create command when you create your cluster.
After the cluster is created with advanced networking enabled, you can
configure the custom resources described in this section using kubectl apply .
Note: The gcloud container bare-metal clusters update command doesn't support
configuring these custom resources.
NetworkGatewayGroup
The NetworkGatewayGroup custom resource is used to provide floating IP
addresses for advanced networking features, such as the
egress NAT gateway or the
bundled load-balancing feature with BGP .
apiVersion : networking.gke.io/v1
kind : NetworkGatewayGroup
name : default
namespace : cluster-bm
spec :
floatingIPs :
- 10.0.1.100
- 10.0.2.100
BGP load balancing
You configure Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) load balancing in the cluster
resource and other custom resources. The gcloud container bare-metal clusters
create and the update commands support configuring BGP in the cluster
resource, but not the custom resources.
When you configure bundled load balancers with BGP, the data plane load
balancing uses, by default, the same external peers that were specified for
control plane peering. Alternatively, you can configure the data plane load
balancing separately, using the BGPLoadBalancer custom resource and the
BGPPeer custom resource. For more information, see
Configure bundled load balancers with BGP .
BGPLoadBalancer
apiVersion : networking.gke.io/v1
kind : BGPLoadBalancer
metadata :
name : default
namespace : cluster-bm
spec :

Increase service network range
To create more services than the initial limit, you can reduce the IPv4 service
CIDR mask to increase the service network of your cluster. Reducing the mask
(the value after "/") results in a bigger network range. You can only
increase the range of the IPv4 service CIDR. The network range
can't be reduced, which means the mask (the value after "/") can't be increased.
bmctl
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : cluster1
namespace : cluster-cluster1
spec :
...
clusterNetwork :
services :
cidrBlocks :
- 192.0.2.0/ 14
...
gcloud CLI
To increase the range of the IPv4 service CIDR on a user cluster, specify
the new range in the --island-mode-service-address-cidr-blocks flag.
gcloud container bare-metal clusters update cluster1 \
--project = example-project-12345 \
--location = us-central1 \
--island-mode-service-address-cidr-blocks = 192 .0.2.0/ 14
Starting with version 1.34, you will see new ServiceCIDR resources in your
cluster. These resources are used by the Kubernetes control plane to manage the
IP address ranges for your services.
Don't attempt to create or modify ServiceCIDR resources manually. They are
managed automatically by the cluster operator based on the values in your
Cluster custom resource. To prevent networking issues, any direct manual edits
are blocked, and you will receive an error message similar to the following:
The servicecidrs "my-cidr" is invalid: : This resource is managed by cluster
operator and cannot be modified directly by users.
Configure kubelet image pull settings
The kubelet runs on each node of your cluster. The kubelet is responsible for
monitoring containers on a node and making sure they are healthy. When needed,
the kubelet queries and pulls images from the Artifact Registry.
Updating your kubelet configurations manually and keeping them synchronized
across all of your cluster nodes can be challenging. To make matters worse,
manual kubelet configuration changes on your nodes are lost when you upgrade
your cluster.
To help make synchronized updates easier and persistent, Google Distributed Cloud
lets you specify some kubelet settings for each of your cluster node pools:
control plane nodes, load balancer nodes, and worker nodes. The settings apply
for all nodes in a given pool and persist through cluster upgrades. The fields
for these settings are mutable, so you can update them at any time, not just
during cluster creation.
bmctl
The following supported fields control Artifact Registry pull operations for
kubelet:
Warning: Setting registryBurst or registryPullQPS to a negative value
results in update job failures for the kubelet configuration. To fix the issue,
either update these fields to positive values or remove them from the spec. If
the update job is left to fail for a long time, it can fill up the machine disk
space with kubelet configuration backup files. You can find these backup files
in /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml.bkup.* . If these backup files are taking up
too much disk space, you can remove them.
registryBurst (default: 10)
registryPullQPS (default: 5)
serializeImagePulls (default: true)
For more information about each of the kubelet configuration fields, see the
Cluster configuration field reference .
You can specify these fields in kubeletConfig sections of the Cluster spec and
the NodePool spec for the following pools of nodes:
Cluster spec:
Control plane nodes spec.controlPlane.nodePoolSpec.kubeletConfig
Load balancer nodes spec.loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec.kubeletConfig
NodePool spec:
Worker nodes spec.kubeletConfig
The following example shows the added fields with their default values in
the cluster configuration file. Note that the annotation preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/custom-kubelet: "enable" is required.
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : cluster1
namespace : cluster-cluster1
annotations :
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/custom-kubelet : "enable"

namespace : cluster-cluster1
spec :
clusterName : cluster1
...
kubeletConfig :
registryBurst : 10
registryPullQPS : 5
serializeImagePulls : true
In each case, the setting applies to all nodes in the pool.
gcloud CLI
The following flags control Artifact Registry pull operations for
kubelet:
Control plane nodes
--control-plane-registry-burst
--control-plane-registry-pull-qps
--disable-control-plane-serialize-image-pulls
--enable-control-plane-serialize-image-pulls
Load balancer nodes
--bgp-load-balancer-registry-burst
--bgp-load-balancer-registry-pull-qps
--disable-bgp-load-balancer-serialize-image-pulls
--enable-bgp-load-balancer-serialize-image-pulls
--metal-lb-load-balancer-registry-burst
--metal-lb-load-balancer-registry-pull-qps
--disable-metal-lb-load-balancer-serialize-image-pull
--enable-metal-lb-load-balancer-serialize-image-pulls
Worker nodes
--registry-burst
--registry-pull-qps
--disable-serialize-image-pulls
--enable-serialize-image-pulls
Warning: Setting the *-registryburst or *-registry-pull-qps flags to a
negative value results in update job failures for the kubelet configuration.
To fix the issue, update these fields to positive values. If the update job is
left to fail for a long time, it can fill up the machine disk space with
kubelet configuration backup files. You can find these backup files
in /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml.bkup.* . If these backup files are taking up
too much disk space, you can remove them.
How to use
Here are some considerations for tuning image pulls:
Since images are pulled in series by default, an image pull that takes a long
time can delay all other image pulls scheduled on a node. Delayed image pulls
can block the upgrade process (especially when new Google Distributed Cloud
images need to be deployed on a node). If you're affected by image pull
delays, you can disable serialize image pulls to allow parallel image
pulls.
If you're encountering image pull throttling errors, such as pull QPS
exceeded , you may want to increase *-registry-pull-qps and
*-registry-burst to increase image pull throughput. These two fields adjust
the pull rate and queue size and may help to address other throttling related
issues. Negative values aren't allowed.
Keepalived customization
Starting in version 1.32, Google Distributed Cloud provides some customization of
the Keepalived configuration. With bundled load balancing, the control plane
load balancer serves the control plane virtual IP (VIP) address.
Google Distributed Cloud runs Keepalived and HAProxy as Kubernetes static Pods on
the load balancer nodes to announce the control plane VIP. Keepalived uses the
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) on the load balancer nodes for high
availability.
Version 1.32 and later clusters have the following Keepalived customizations:
For high availability control planes, Google Distributed Cloud automatically
configures the Keepalived VRRP configuration to make failover behaviour
deterministic and prevent interleaving of ARP replies with different MAC
addresses:
Each Keepalived instance is configured automatically with a different
priority value in the VRRP router.
Each Keepalived instance is configured automatically with nopreempt to
avoid elections when a non-master instance is restarted.
Google Distributed Cloud lets you specify the number of gratuitous ARP (GARP)
messages to send at a time after a control plane node transitions to the
role of the master server. To change the number of GARP messages to send,
add the
controlPlane.loadBalancer.keepalivedVRRPGARPMasterRepeat
field to the cluster configuration file, set it to the new value, and update
your cluster. This value maps to the vrrp_garp_master_repeat setting for
Keepalived. The default value is 5.
The following example shows how to specify keepalivedVRRPGARPMasterRepeat
in the cluster configuration file:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : hybrid-ha-lb

Enable dynamic resource allocation
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Dynamic resource allocation is a Kubernetes API that lets you request and share generic
resources, such as GPUs, among Pods and containers. Third-party drivers manage
these resources. This capability helps you run AI workloads by dynamically and
precisely allocating the GPU resources within your bare metal clusters,
improving resource utilization and performance for demanding workloads.
Dynamic resource allocation is available for preview for version 1.33 and later clusters. The
following instructions describe how to configure your cluster to use dynamic resource allocation.
After it's enabled, you can configure your GPU workloads to use dynamic resource allocation.
Configure your cluster to enable dynamic resource allocation:
Edit your cluster configuration file to include the
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/dynamic-resource-allocation: "enable"
preview annotation and add DynamicResourceAllocation: true under
featureGates in the kubeletConfig section:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : dra
namespace : cluster-dra
annotations :
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/dynamic-resource-allocation : "enable"
spec :
controlPlane :
nodePoolSpec :
kubeletConfig :
featureGates :
DynamicResourceAllocation : true
# ... other cluster configuration
Update the cluster by running the bmctl update command:
bmctl update cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig = ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the ame of the user cluster you are
updating.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path of the admin cluster
kubeconfig file.
After you apply this configuration, the READY field for your bare metal
machines might switch between True and False multiple times. Wait for
the READY field to stabilize on True before proceeding.
To enable the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate in node pools that have
nodes with GPUs, set DynamicResourceAllocation to true in the
featureGates section of the kubeletConfig section of the NodePool spec:
For instructions to add and update a node pool, see Manage node pools in a
cluster .
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : NodePool
metadata :
name : np
namespace : cluster-dra
spec :
clusterName : dra
kubeletConfig :
featureGates :
DynamicResourceAllocation : true
nodes :
# ... other node pool configuration
After you have added or updated the node pool, wait for all bare metal
machines in the node pool to reach a Ready status.
To check the status of your cluster bare metal machines, use the following command:
kubectl get baremetalmachines --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG -A
When the bare metal machines are ready, the response should look similar to
the following sample response:
NAMESPACE NAME CLUSTER READY INSTANCEID MACHINE ABM VERSION DESIRED ABM VERSION
cluster-admin 10.200.0.2 dra true baremetal://10.200.0.2 10.200.0.2 1.33.0-gke.793 1.33.0-gke.793
cluster-user-dra 10.200.0.6 user-dra true baremetal://10.200.0.6 10.200.0.6 1.33.0-gke.793 1.33.0-gke.793
cluster-user-dra 10.200.0.7 user-dra true baremetal://10.200.0.7 10.200.0.7 1.33.0-gke.793 1.33.0-gke.793
cluster-user-dra 10.200.0.8 user-dra true baremetal://10.200.0.8 10.200.0.8 1.33.0-gke.793 1.33.0-gke.793
Limitations
The bundled NVIDIA GPU Operator has the following limitations:
The bundled NVIDIA GPU Operator supports the following NVIDIA software components
only:
NVIDIA Container Toolkit
NVIDIA DCGM Exporter
NVIDIA Kubernetes Device Plugin
NVIDIA MIG Manager for Kubernetes.
During Preview ,
the NVIDIA GPU Operator configuration is fixed. If you attempt to customize any
settings, they are reconciled back to the original installation settings.
The bundled NVIDIA GPU Operator can't be used to install NVIDIA GPU drivers.
During Preview, this feature uses the resource.k8s.io/v1beta1 API group,
which differs from the open source Kubernetes API group for this feature,
resource.k8s.io/v1 . The v1 open source API group provides more features
and better stability than the v1beta1 API group.
