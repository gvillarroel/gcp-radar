Tutorial: Create and manage a Linux VM in VM Runtime on GDC
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial shows you how to create and manage a Linux virtual machine (VM)
on a new installation of VM Runtime on GDC. You learn the process to
create and define the basic dependencies such as a StorageClass and virtual
network, then create a VM that uses these resources. You then learn how to edit
the VM, such as to add a new disk.

Edit a VM to add a new virtual disk
Before you begin
To complete this tutorial, you need access to the following resources and
tools:
Access to Google Distributed Cloud version 1.12.0 ( anthosBareMetalVersion: 1.12.0 )
or higher cluster. You can use any cluster type capable of running workloads.
If needed,
try Google Distributed Cloud on Compute Engine
or see the
cluster creation overview .
The virtctl client tool installed as a plugin for kubectl . If needed,
install the virtctl client tool .
Create a StorageClass
You use a StorageClass to define the type of storage you make available to
VMs. Different storage classes might map to a different type of storage
hardware, file system, or performance.
It's beyond the scope of this tutorial to provide specific instructions for
each StorageClass and storage partner.
Google Distributed Cloud Ready storage partners
provide qualified
Container Storage Interface (CSI)
drivers that install and configure the required custom resources for your
storage. To install the CSI driver in your cluster, review the list of supported
storage partners and follow their instructions.
After you install the CSI driver for your storage platform, one or more storage
classes are available in your cluster. You use one of these storage classes to
create a virtual hard disk in this tutorial.
The following basic example
NFS StorageClass
uses the
NFS CSI Driver .
You define the NFS server address and path to use in the StorageClass . All the
nodes in your cluster can then connect to and use this NFS storage:
apiVersion : storage.k8s.io/v1
kind : StorageClass
metadata :
name : example-nfs
provisioner : nfs.csi.k8s.io
parameters :
server : nfs-server.example.com
path : /vm-share
reclaimPolicy : Delete
volumeBindingMode : Immediate
mountOptions :
- nconnect=8
- nfsvers=4.1
In this tutorial, use the name of a StorageClass in your own cluster.
VM Runtime on GDC automatically generates one storage profile for
each StorageClass in a cluster. The storage profile is the same name as the
associated StorageClass . Storage profiles provide extra configuration options
associated with each StorageClass . For more information about storage
profiles, including configuration instructions, see
Configure storage profiles .
Create a virtual network
VMs connect to a virtual network using a virtual network interface. The virtual
network lets them communicate with other VMs in the cluster, or to resources
outside of the cluster.
In this tutorial, you create a basic Layer 2 ( L2 ) virtual network that can use
an external DHCP server. When you enable the use of an external DHCP server, you
can skip configuration of DNS and gateway settings if they're provided by
DHCP.
To create a network that uses an external DHCP server, complete the following
steps:
Create a Network manifest, such as dhcp-network.yaml , in the editor
of your choice:
nano dhcp-network.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML manifest:
apiVersion : networking.gke.io/v1
kind : Network
metadata :
name : NETWORK_NAME
spec :
type : L2
nodeInterfaceMatcher :
interfaceName : INTERFACE_NAME
externalDHCP4 : true
Replace the following values:
NETWORK_NAME : the name for your network.
INTERFACE_NAME : the interface name on your
Google Distributed Cloud node to attach the network to. All nodes should have
the same interface name.
In this Network manifest, the following values are set:
Workloads can have only an L2 attachment to this network. This is the only
network type that you can create in VM Runtime on GDC.
The network has external DHCP enabled. The external DHCP server is
responsible for IPv4 address allocation, routes, gateway, and DNS
configuration for workloads connected to this network.
Save and close the Network manifest in your editor.
Create the network using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f use-dhcp-network.yaml
Create a VM boot disk
A VM can use a precreated disk image, or boot from an ISO image to manually
install the OS. These disk images can be stored and accessed using HTTP, or in
Cloud Storage and accessed using a Secret .
In this tutorial, you create a boot disk from the public Ubuntu Server 20.04
cloud image using HTTP.
To create a disk from an image, complete the following steps.
Create a VirtualMachineDisk manifest, such as my-disk.yaml , in the
editor of your choice:
nano my-disk.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML definition:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachineDisk
metadata :
name : DISK_NAME
spec :
size : 20Gi
storageClassName : STORAGE_CLASS_NAME
source :
http :
url : https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/focal/release/ubuntu-20.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
Replace the following values:
DISK_NAME : the name that you want for your disk. This
example creates a 20Gi (20 gibibyte) disk named
DISK_NAME using a public Ubuntu
Server 20.04 image.
STORAGE_CLASS_NAME : the StorageClass that you want
to use for your VirtualMachineDisk .
Use kubectl get storageclass to list what's available in your cluster.
Note: It can take 15–20 minutes to download this public image, create the
VirtualMachineDisk , and apply the OS image to the new disk. The process to
create the VirtualMachineDisk is much faster when you use a locally stored
image. For most production scenarios, use a local HTTP image repository rather
than pull from an external public source each time.
Save and close the VirtualMachineDisk manifest in your editor.
Create the disk using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-disk.yaml
Create a VM
With a virtual network and boot disk created in the previous sections, now
create a VM. The VM connects to the virtual network, and boots from the virtual
disk. The following instructions create a VM by directly applying a
VirtualMachine YAML manifest file with the kubectl CLI.
Note: When you create a VM from a YAML manifest, you can configure it to have a
custom initialization whenever it starts. For prerequisites and instructions for
configuring a new VM with startup routines, see
Configure VM startup routines .
Create a manifest that defines a VirtualMachine , such as my-vm.yaml , in
the editor of your choice:
nano my-vm.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML definition:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : VM_NAME
spec :
osType : linux
compute :
cpu :
vcpus : VCPU_NUMBER
memory :
capacity : MEMORY_SIZE
interfaces :
- name : eth0
networkName : NETWORK_NAME
default : true
disks :
- boot : true
virtualMachineDiskName : DISK_NAME
Replace the following values:
VM_NAME : the name for your VM.
VCPU_NUMBER : The optional number of vCPUs to assign to
the VM. Without this setting, the default of 2 vCPUs is assigned.
You can assign between 1 and 96 vCPUs to a VM.
MEMORY_SIZE : The optional amount of memory to assign to
the VM. Without this setting, the default of 4 GiB of memory is assigned.
You can assign between 1M and 1T of memory to a VM. For more information,
see
Memory resource units .
NETWORK_NAME : the name of your network created in a
previous section.
DISK_NAME : the name of your boot disk created in the
previous section. This disk is set to boot: true .
Save and close the manifest in your editor.
Create the VM and disk using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-vm.yaml
It can take a few minutes to create the VM. Check the status of the VM with
the kubectl command:
kubectl get gvm VM_NAME
The following example output shows the VM in a Running state:
NAME STATUS AGE IP
MY_VM Running 64s 192 .168.2.124
Connect to the VM
When your VM is running, connect to the console of the VM. This console
connection lets you perform basic tasks such as to further configure the VM or
install an application.
To access a VM from the console, use kubectl :
kubectl virt console VM_NAME
When prompted, enter the user credentials that you specified to create the VM.
After you successfully connect to the console of the VM, exit the VM session
and console:
Ctrl + ]
Edit the VM
During the lifecycle of your VM, you might want to edit your VM. For example,
you might want to add storage to install an application on a dedicated disk, or
use additional storage for your application.
In this tutorial, create a blank disk and attach it to the VM. This scenario
lets you create a data disk to store application data.
Create a VirtualMachineDisk manifest, such as my-data-disk.yaml , in the
editor of your choice:
nano my-data-disk.yaml
Copy and paste the following YAML definition:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachineDisk
metadata :
name : DATA_DISK_NAME
spec :
size : 10Gi
storageClassName : STORAGE_CLASS_NAME
Replace the following values:
DATA_DISK_NAME : the name that you want for
your data disk. This example creates a 10Gi (10 gibibyte) disk.
STORAGE_CLASS_NAME : the StorageClass that you want
to use for your VirtualMachineDisk .
Use kubectl get storageclass to list what's available in your cluster.
Save and close the disk manifest in your editor.
Create the disk using kubectl :
kubectl apply -f my-data-disk.yaml
Use kubectl to stop your VM before you attach the new virtual disk:
kubectl virt stop VM_NAME
Edit your VM resource:
kubectl edit gvm VM_NAME
Update the VirtualMachine YAML manifest to attach the disk at the end of the
VM's spec.disks section:
apiVersion : vm.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : VirtualMachine
metadata :
name : VM_NAME
spec :
...
disks :
- boot : true
virtualMachineDiskName : DISK_NAME
- virtualMachineDiskName : DATA_DISK_NAME
Replace DATA_DISK_NAME with the name of your disk created
in the previous step.
Save and close the updated VM manifest in your editor.
Use kubectl to start the VM:
kubectl virt start VM_NAME
Clean up
To delete the resources created in this tutorial, complete the following
steps:
Delete your VM:
kubectl delete -f my-vm.yaml
Delete your VirtualMachineDisk resources:
kubectl delete -f my-data-disk.yaml
kubectl delete -f my-disk.yaml
If you don't want to keep the basic dependencies in your cluster, complete the
following steps:
Delete your virtual network:
kubectl delete -f use-dhcp-network.yaml
To remove the CSI driver from your cluster, follow the instructions from your
storage partner.
