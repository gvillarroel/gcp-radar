VM Runtime on Google Distributed Cloud overview

VM Runtime on Google Distributed Cloud is the key component for running virtual machine-based
workloads in installations of Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on bare
metal.
What is VM Runtime on GDC?
VM Runtime on GDC is a part of Google Distributed Cloud that lets you
run VMs on top of Kubernetes in the same way that you run containers. With
VM Runtime on GDC, you can run existing VM-based workloads as you
also develop and run new container-based applications.
VM Runtime on GDC is like the hypervisor in another virtualized
environment.
VM Runtime on GDC lets you view and manage the state of VMs and
gather audit or console logs. VM Runtime on GDC acts like management
console tools that are used in other virtualized environments.
You aren't forced to modernize or upgrade existing VM-based workloads to use
VM Runtime on GDC. VMs run like they do in other virtualized
environments, but benefit from a single set of workflows and processes for your
applications in a cluster. When you're ready, you can migrate these VM-based
workloads to containers and continue using the same management tools.
Benefits
The VM Runtime on GDC has the following benefits:
Ability to use VM resources programmatically, like you use containers.
Efficient use of resources across containers and VMs.
Unified management and operation for VMs and containers.
Unified visibility and control for traffic between new containerized
applications and legacy VM-based apps.
A simplified migration experience to cloud or containerized apps.
The VM Runtime on GDC helps you migrate your VMs, or build new ones,
on top of your bare metal cluster.
How VM Runtime on GDC differs from KubeVirt
VM Runtime on GDC builds on the KubeVirt open source
project . Kubevirt is built specifically for Kubernetes,
and follows the declarative API model to use the Kubernetes Resource Model,
custom resource definitions, or operators. VM Runtime on GDC
integrates Kubevirt into your Google Distributed Cloud software-only installation
to give a consistent way to manage your applications. This section outlines some
of the key capabilities of VM Runtime on GDC that aren't available
in KubeVirt.
Lifecycle
Building on the power of Google Kubernetes Engine,
VM Runtime on GDC is fully integrated with the
Google Cloud. You can install, upgrade, and uninstall
VM Runtime on GDC with a CLI command, through the API, or by using
the Google Cloud console. When used with compatible storage,
cluster upgrades include live migration of VM workloads
( Preview ) between hosts to minimize
potential VM workload disruption.
Cloud-backed management experience
VM Runtime on GDC provides a cloud-like experience for your on-premises
installation. This experience includes the following new cloud-like primitives:
VirtualMachineType object lets administrators create
predefined VM types
with specific CPU and memory configurations.
VirtualMachineDisk and StorageProfile objects add
support for multiple disks and
centralized management of StorageClass properties .
Network object enables
virtual switch-like capabilities
in Kubernetes.
Storage
VM Runtime on GDC automatically generates a storage profile object,
StorageProfile , for each StorageClass in a cluster. This new profile object
lets you
configure StorageClass properties for VMs ,
including accessMode and volumeMode , from a single location.
You can attach multiple disks to a VM. You can attach an existing disk or you
can create and attach new disks. The new VirtualMachineDisk custom resource
lets you create blank disks or disks from existing images using the bundled
Containerized Data Importer (CDI). CDI even lets you pull
images from Cloud Storage secured with credentials .
Networking
VM Runtime on GDC expands on the default pod-network offering of
KubeVirt to provide
networking options more suitable for production VM workloads .
VM Runtime on GDC extends the existing network stack that's based on
Container Network Interface (CNI) framework. VM Runtime on GDC adds
a Network object that enables virtual switch-like capabilities in Kubernetes.
While network plugins are available for Kubernetes, they require their own
installation, lifecycle, and management. With VM Runtime on GDC, out
of the box VMs can interact with multiple Layer 2 network interfaces, including
support for VLAN tags, external DHCP, and more. VM Runtime on GDC
also introduces the interfaces object, which enables both IP and MAC address
stickiness even if VMs are restarted, migrated, or recreated. The new network
stack also integrates with NetworkPolicy so you can use Kubernetes primitives
to control Layer 4 traffic between VMs.
Observability
VM Runtime on GDC automatically supports VM observability in the
Google Cloud console. In addition to the GKE cluster and
VM Runtime on GDC logging,
VM serial console logs are
automatically streamed to Cloud Logging. Your VM logs can be viewed in the
Logs Explorer along with
container logs. You can see VM CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics in the
Google Cloud console. You can also implement dashboards, alerts, and integration
with notifications using familiar Google Cloud services.
Management
Most VM Runtime on GDC capabilities are available from the command
line, APIs, and Google Cloud console. This flexible approach supports multiple
developer and operational styles. The Google Cloud produccts Config Sync
and Policy Controller can also be used to implement both GitOps
methodology and granular policies. Finally, KubeVirt tools, such as virtctl ,
have also been extended to support the additional VM Runtime on GDC
capabilities.
GPU Support
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
