Google's primary support objective is to resolve production incidents as quickly
as possible. We do this by understanding your configuration, analyzing logs and
metrics, and collaborating with partners to solve incidents quickly.
Cloud Customer Care offers various support packages to accommodate your support
needs. All Cloud Customer Care packages include support for
GKE and Google Distributed Cloud. If you have an existing
Cloud Customer Care support package, then you already have
support for GKE and Google Distributed Cloud.
For more information, see the
Cloud Customer Care hub .
Requirements for Google Distributed Cloud support
To effectively troubleshoot business-critical incidents, you must do the
following:
Check that your environment is current and within the published
end-of-support timeframes. For more information, see the
Version Support Policy section.
Enable Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring
for system components. For more information, see the following
Support tools section.
Support tools
To troubleshoot a Google Distributed Cloud incident, Cloud Customer Care
relies on three pieces of information:
Your environment configuration
Logs from your clusters
Metrics from your clusters
Your environment configuration
When you open a support case, provide key information about your cluster setup
by running the following commands:
For all your cluster types, capture information about Kubernetes and your
nodes by running the bmctl check cluster --snapshot command. Attach the
resulting tar file to the support case.
For admin, hybrid, and standalone clusters, check the health status of the
cluster and nodes by running the bmctl check cluster command. Attach the
resulting logs to the support case. The logs should exist under the
bmctl-workspace/[CLUSTER_NAME]/log/check-cluster-[TIMESTAMP] directory.
For user clusters, first create a health check YAML file with the cluster
name and namespace, and then apply the file in the appropriate admin
cluster:
Create a YAML file with the following healthcheck properties. The
following is sample content for a cluster named user1 in the
cluster-user1 namespace:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : HealthCheck
metadata :
generateName : healthcheck-
namespace : cluster-user1
spec :
clusterName : user1
After you create the YAML file, apply the custom resource in the admin
cluster that's managing the user cluster by using the kubectl command.
The following is a sample command that uses the YAML file created in
the previous step. In the sample, the
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG variable specifies the path to
the admin cluster's kubeconfig file:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG create -f healthcheck-user1.yaml
The command returns the following response:
healthcheck.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/healthcheck-7c4qf created
Wait until the health check job is completed. To do so, test to see if
the health check job finished reconciling. In the previous example case,
the health check job name is
healthcheck.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/healthcheck-7c4qf . The following
is a sample test that uses the kubectl command, and it waits 30
minutes for the health check job to complete:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG wait healthcheck healthcheck-7c4qf \
-n cluster-user1 --for = condition = Reconciling = False --timeout = 30m
When the health check job is complete, the preceding kubectl command
returns:
healthcheck.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/healthcheck-7c4qf condition met
You can see the health check job results with the following command:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG get healthcheck healthcheck-7c4qf \
-n cluster-user1
The command returns the following result:
NAME PASS AGE
healthcheck-7c4qf true 17m
Gather all the logs for the health check job Pod into a local file by
using the kubectl command. The following is an example that uses the
previous sample health check job:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG logs -n cluster-user1 \
-l baremetal.cluster.gke.io/check-name = healthcheck-7c4qf --tail = -1 > \
healthcheck-7c4qf.log
Cluster logs
When you create a new Google Distributed Cloud cluster, Cloud Logging
agents are enabled by default and scoped only to system-level components. This
replicates system-level logs into the Google Cloud project associated with
the cluster. System-level logs are from Kubernetes Pods in the following
namespaces:
kube-system
gke-system
gke-connect
istio-system
config-management-system
gatekeeper-system
cnrm-system
knative-serving
You can query logs from the
Logs Explorer .
Note: If Cloud Logging is disabled, support is offered on
a best-effort basis only, and could require significant additional effort from
your on-site engineering team.
For more details, see
Configure logging and monitoring .
Google Cloud CLI and remote cluster access
If you open a support case, Cloud Customer Care might ask you for remote read-only
access to your clusters to help diagnose and resolve issues more effectively.
For Cloud Customer Care to have sufficient access to troubleshoot your cluster
issue remotely, ensure that you've installed and updated to the latest version
of the Google Cloud CLI . The Google Cloud CLI must be at version
401.0.0 or higher to give Cloud Customer Care the needed permissions. We recommend
that you update Google Cloud CLI regularly to pick up added permissions and other
enhancements.
To install the latest components of the gcloud CLI, use the
gcloud components update command.
For more information about giving Cloud Customer Care remote read-only access to
your clusters, see
Remote GKE Cluster Support .
Cluster metrics
In addition to logs, the Cloud Monitoring agent also captures metrics. This
replicates system-level metrics into the Google Cloud project associated
with the cluster. System-level metrics are from Kubernetes Pods that run in the
same namespaces that are listed in the Cluster logs section.
Note: If Cloud Monitoring is disabled, support is offered on a best-effort
basis only, and could require significant additional effort from your on-site
engineering team.
For more details, see
Configure logging and monitoring .
How we troubleshoot your environment
Here is an example of a typical support incident:
The cluster administrator opens a support case in Google Cloud console with
Cloud Customer Care . They then select GKE
and Google Distributed Cloud as Category and Component , respectively.
They enter the required information and attach the output of relevant
bmctl commands to the case.
The support case is routed to a Technical Support Engineer who specializes
in Google Distributed Cloud.
The support engineer examines the contents of the snapshot to gain context
of the environment.
The support engineer examines the logs and metrics in the Google Cloud
project. They enter the support case ID as the business justification,
which is logged internally.
The support engineer responds to the case with an assessment and
recommendation. The support engineer and the user continue troubleshooting
until they come to a resolution.

Version Support Policy
The objective of this Version Support Policy is to give you the flexibility to
schedule upgrades when it meets your business needs, while balancing the rapid
evolution of both Kubernetes and Google Distributed Cloud.
Google Distributed Cloud software only follows the Kubernetes versioning
scheme and release cycle. Minor releases happen approximately
three times per year. Patches for each supported minor version occur
approximately monthly. Like Kubernetes, Google Distributed Cloud supports the
latest three minor versions concurrently.
Google supports each Google Distributed Cloud minor version for the later of:
12 months after the initial release of the minor version.
The release of the third subsequent minor version.
For example, minor version 1.33 released on September 02, 2025. This minor
version and all of its patches are supported until either September 02, 2026 or
the release date of minor version 1.36, whichever date is later.
We encourage you to maintain your Google Distributed Cloud environment with the
product's latest minor release and recommended patch
version .
This version support policy includes:
Break-fix support from Cloud Customer Care.
CVE security vulnerabilities to Kubernetes and related components.
General patches to Kubernetes and related components.
When your version reaches end-of-life, you can continue to open cases to receive
support for the following:
Help with technical issues.
Assistance with billing issues.
Guidance on product usage, including help with troubleshooting and testing.
Extended support can be conditionally approved as a one-time event, with
version-pinning, and future upgrade timeline requirements. For additional
information, reach out to the lead customer engineer for your account or the
account manager. Alternatively, you can file a support
case through Google Cloud console. Such requests are routed
to the customer engineering group for your account.
Support period
The following table shows the supported minor releases for
Google Distributed Cloud and the earliest end-of-life (EOL) dates:
Google Distributed Cloud version
Release date
End-of-life date *
1.33
2025-09-02
2026-09-02 or 1.36 release date
1.32
2025-05-06
2026-05-06 or 1.35 release date
1.31
2024-12-18
2025-12-18 or 1.34 release date
* The EOL will be the later of these two dates.
To learn more version compatibility for Google Distributed Cloud and related
Google Cloud products, see Version and upgrade
support .
Versioning scheme
Google Distributed Cloud uses Kubernetes
semantic versioning to refer to supported
Kubernetes versions, but appends a GKE patch version. This
results in a version number of the form: x.y.z-gke.N .
Kubernetes major version (x)
Major versions are typically incremented if any backwards
incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. A major version
increments the Kubernetes version from x.y to x+1.y .
Kubernetes minor version (y)
Kubernetes releases a new minor version
three times a year .
Each release cycle is approximately 15 weeks long. Deprecated
APIs might
be removed with a new minor version. A minor version increments the
Kubernetes version from 1.y to 1.y+1 ; for example, Kubernetes 1.
29 is the minor release that follows
Kubernetes 1. 28 .
Google Distributed Cloud patch release (z-gke.N)
A patch release, such as 1.28. 300-gke.131 ,
increments the patch version (z) by 100 and includes a -gke.N suffix, which
indicates the build. Patch releases include security updates and bug fixes.
A Google Distributed Cloud patch release version doesn't correlate to a
Kubernetes patch version.
Shared responsibility model
Running a business-critical production application on Google Distributed Cloud
requires multiple parties to carry different responsponsibilities. Although they
aren't an exhaustive list, the following sections list the roles and
responsibilities of different parties.
Google responsibilities
Maintenance and distribution of the Google Distributed Cloud software package.
Notifying users of available upgrades for Google Distributed Cloud, and
producing upgrade scripts for the previous version.
Google Distributed Cloud supports sequential cluster upgrades only (example:
1.32 → 1.33 → 1.34, but not
1.32 → 1.34). When you upgrade node pools, in
some cases, you can skip a minor version. For more information about upgrade
logic, see Version rules .
Operating the Connect and Cloud Operations services.
Troubleshooting, providing workarounds, and correcting the root cause of any
issues related to Google-provided components.
User responsibilities
Overall system administration for on-premises clusters.
Maintaining any application workload deployed on the cluster.
Running, maintaining, and patching the data center infrastructure, including
networking, servers, operating system, storage, and connectivity to
Google Cloud.
Running, maintaining, and patching network load balancers if manual load
balancer option is chosen.
Upgrading Google Distributed Cloud versions regularly.
Monitoring of the cluster and applications, and responding to any incidents.
Ensuring Cloud Operations agents are deployed to clusters.
Providing Google with environmental details for troubleshooting purposes.
Developer support
Google doesn't provide support specifically for your application workloads.
However, we do provide best-effort developer support to ensure your developers
can run applications on Google Distributed Cloud. We believe that engaging earlier
during development can prevent critical incidents later in the deployment.
This best-effort developer support is available to customers with any paid
support package and is treated as a P3 priority for an issue blocking a launch,
or a P4 priority for general consultation. In this classification, priority
level 0 is the highest priority.
