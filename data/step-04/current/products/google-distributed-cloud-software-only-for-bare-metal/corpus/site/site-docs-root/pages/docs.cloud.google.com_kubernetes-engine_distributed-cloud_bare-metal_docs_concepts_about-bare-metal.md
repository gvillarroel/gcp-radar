Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for bare metal overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Distributed Cloud is a fully managed software and hardware solution that extends
Google Cloud infrastructure and services into your data center.
Google Distributed Cloud is available in both connected and air-gapped
configurations that run on Google-provided hardware. Google Distributed Cloud is
also available as a software-only product that runs on your own hardware.
Google Distributed Cloud software can be installed on either VMware or bare metal.
This guide is for Google Distributed Cloud software that runs directly on your
bare metal machines.
Google Distributed Cloud software is based on
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) ,
with its own Kubernetes package that extends GKE for use in an
on-premises environment. With Google Distributed Cloud you can create, manage, and
upgrade GKE clusters on your own premises while using
Google Cloud features, and deploy and operate containerized applications on your
clusters at scale using Google's infrastructure.
Note: Google Distributed Cloud software-only was formerly known as
Google Distributed Cloud Virtual, which was previously known as Anthos clusters on
bare metal.
Why use Google Distributed Cloud on bare metal?
Running Google Distributed Cloud software on bare metal takes advantage of your
existing enterprise infrastructure and helps you modernize applications
throughout their lifecycle.
Bring your own node
With a software-only installation on bare metal of Google Distributed Cloud, you
deploy applications directly on your own hardware infrastructure, which provides
the best performance and flexibility. You have direct control over application
scale, security, and network latency. You also get the benefits of containerized
applications through GKE components.
Improved performance and lowered cost
Google Distributed Cloud manages application deployment and health across your
existing corporate data centers for more efficient operation. Also, you can run
containers at the edge of the network, so analytic apps can run with full
performance.
Using Google Distributed Cloud on bare metal instead of virtual machines gives you
the ability to manage application containers on a wide variety of
performance-optimized hardware types, like GPUs and SSDs. Running
Google Distributed Cloud on bare metal also allows for direct application access
to hardware.
Compatible security
Because you control your node environment, you can optimize your network,
hardware, and applications to meet your specific requirements. As a result,
you can directly control system security, without having to worry about your
compatibility with virtual machines and operating systems.
Monitored application deployment
Google Distributed Cloud provides advanced monitoring of the health and
performance of your environment. This monitoring capability helps you adjust the
scale of applications while maintaining reliability despite fluctuations in
workload and network traffic.
You manage monitoring, logging, and analysis of clusters and workloads through
the Connect Agent .
Network latency and flexibility
Because you manage your network requirements, your network can be optimized for
low latency. This network optimization can be crucial for performance in
commercial or finance analytics and other enterprise or network edge
applications.
Highly available
Google Distributed Cloud includes support for multiple control plane nodes in a
cluster. If a control plane node goes down, you can still administer your
environment.
Secure design and control
Your infrastructure security can be customized for your own needs, with minimal
connections to outside resources. Most importantly, there is no additional VM
complexity when deploying security systems, and you maintain complete OS control
when interacting with existing security systems.
Google Distributed Cloud works with lightweight secure connections to Google APIs.
You can manage clusters and applications from a central location with
Connect and Cloud Monitoring. This centralization also helps keep
your deployments running smoothly, and lets Google Cloud Support troubleshoot
issues more effectively.
Preflight checks on installation
With Google Distributed Cloud, your clusters run on open source and enterprise
Linux systems, and on a minimal hardware infrastructure, which creates
flexibility in your environment. It also includes various preflight checks to
help ensure successful configurations and installations.
Application deployment and load balancing
Google Distributed Cloud includes Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing mechanisms at
cluster creation.
Improved etcd reliability
To monitor the size and defragment etcd databases, Google Distributed Cloud
control planes include an etcddefrag Pod. The etcddefrag Pod reclaims
storage from large etcd databases and recovers etcd when disk space is
exceeded.
How it works
Google Distributed Cloud extends
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
to let you create clusters on your own Linux servers on your own premises. You
manage these on-premises clusters in Google Cloud
along with regular GKE clusters and clusters in other
environments as part of a fleet.
GKE clusters run in Google Cloud where the Kubernetes control
plane and network infrastructure are managed by Google Cloud. Because clusters
created with Google Distributed Cloud run in your data center, we provide some
administration and control plane software in addition to the GKE
software. The software that runs in your data center is downloaded as part of
the installation and upgrade processes.
The following diagram shows the simplified result of a completed installation:

Key components
The following components make up a software-only installation on bare metal of
Google Distributed Cloud:
The admin cluster consists of one or more control plane nodes . Each node
is a physical machine running a supported Linux operating system. The
standard deployment consists of an admin cluster that manages the lifecycle
of one or more user clusters through Kubernetes Resource Management (KRM).
Each node machine in the installation has its own IP address.
A user cluster is where the workloads that implement your applications run,
like in GKE on Google Cloud. Each user cluster consists of at
least one control plane node and one worker node .
The admin workstation is a separate machine (typically) that includes the
tools and cluster artifacts, such as configuration files. Cluster creators
and developers use these tools and artifacts to manage their on-premises
clusters, with appropriate permissions:
Running
bmctl
from the admin workstation lets you create and update clusters and
perform some other administrative tasks.
Running kubectl from the admin workstation lets you interact with your
admin and user clusters, including deploying and managing workloads.
The GKE On-Prem API is the Google Cloud-hosted API for cluster lifecycle
management. You use the API clients (Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, and
Terraform) to create and manage the lifecycle of your on-premises clusters
as an alternative to logging into the admin workstation to manage your
clusters with the bmctl CLI.
The console also provides a web interface for your
Google Cloud project, including on-premises clusters. The
console displays key metrics about your clusters to help you
monitor cluster health.
Cluster administrators and developers use kubectl to access cluster
control planes through virtual IP addresses (VIPs) specified as part of
cluster configuration. Application users and developers use Service and
Ingress VIPs to access and expose workloads respectively.
Connecting to the fleet
All user clusters (and optionally admin clusters) are members of a
fleet : a logical grouping of Kubernetes
clusters. Fleets let your organization uplevel management from individual
clusters to entire groups of clusters, and can help your teams adopt similar
best practices to those used at Google. You can view and manage fleet clusters
together in the Google Cloud console, and use fleet-enabled
GKE features to help you manage, govern, and operate
your workloads at scale. You can see a complete list of available fleet features
for on-premises environments.
Each fleet cluster's connection to Google Cloud is managed by a
Connect Agent, which is deployed as part of the Google Distributed Cloud
installation process. You can learn more about how this agent works in the
Connect Agent overview .
Fleet membership is also used to manage Google Distributed Cloud pricing on bare
metal, as described in the next section.
Pricing
On-premises clusters created using Google Distributed Cloud are billed per vCPU.
You enable billing by enabling the Anthos
API in your Google Cloud
project.
For full pricing information, including how to contact sales, see
Google Kubernetes Engine pricing .
Versions
To learn about Google Distributed Cloud versions, see
Version Support Policy .
This documentation covers all supported versions of Google Distributed Cloud.
Where relevant, we also retain limited information for older, unsupported
versions in this documentation. Version-specific differences in requirements and
behavior are noted in the documentation. Similarly, when a new feature becomes
available, the supported version for the feature is documented.
For a list of the supported minor versions and available patches, see
Versioning .
Starting with the 1.29 release, we no longer create a numbered directory for the
previous minor release documentation. You can find archived documentation for
version 1.16 and earlier by adding the minor version number in the following
URL:
https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/ VERSION /
Replace VERSION with a minor version from 1.6 to 1.16 and
copy the URL to the address bar in your browser.
Installing Google Distributed Cloud on bare metal
Because clusters created using Google Distributed Cloud run in your own
infrastructure, they're highly configurable. Once you select the deployment
model that meets your particular
organizational and use case needs, you can choose from a range of supported load
balancing modes, IP addressing options, security features, connectivity options,
and more. Setting up a cluster involves making decisions before and during
installation. This documentation set includes guides to help your team decide on
the right features and options for you. To ensure that your installation meets
the needs of your organization, consult with your networking and application
teams.
