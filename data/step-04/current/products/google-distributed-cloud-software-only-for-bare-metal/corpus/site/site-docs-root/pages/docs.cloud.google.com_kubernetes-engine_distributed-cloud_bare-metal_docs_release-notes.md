1.32
Fixed
The following issues were fixed in 1.32.1000-gke.57:
Fixed vulnerabilities listed in Vulnerability fixes .
Cluster and
node pool failures are now surfaced in the RecentFailures field
in the cluster status. This change provides a centralized location for viewing
errors from both worker node pools and control plane nodes, improving the
troubleshooting and debugging experience.
Fixed an issue where Metrics API operations—including
kubectl top , Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), and Vertical Pod Autoscaling
(VPA)—could fail with TLS verification errors during CA rotation.
Resolved an issue where Certificate Authority (CA) rotation became stuck
on self-managed clusters (admin, hybrid, or standalone). This fix resolves an
internal resource synchronization error that previously prevented the rotation
process from completing successfully.

1.33
Announcement
In Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for bare metal versions 1.33.0 and later,
bmctl operations can fail to stream logs from pods to the local workspace,
causing empty or incomplete logs in bmctl-workspace/{CLUSTER NAME}/log directory .
This issue occurred because a recent Kubernetes library upgrade introduced a
required context parameter for pod log streaming. The bmctl tool was
incorrectly passing a context with a 10-second timeout, causing the log streamer
to terminate prematurely for pods with long lifecycles, such as Ansible runner
jobs.
This issue is resolved in the following versions:
1.33.500 and later
1.34.100 and later
1.35.0 and later
If you use an affected version and require the logs for a failed or ongoing
operation, check logs using kubectl . If the cluster is accessible, you can
manually retrieve logs directly from the relevant pods using the kubectl logs
command.
It is recommended to upgrade to a fixed version to ensure that all bmctl
operation logs are correctly captured in your local workspace for troubleshooting
and auditing purposes

Feature
The following features were added in 1.34.0-gke.566:
Preview : Vertical Pod autoscaling can now be configured to use your
Prometheus instance as a persistent history provider for long-term CPU and
memory usage data.
Preview : Added support for horizontal Pod autoscaling that uses custom
metrics from your Prometheus server to scale your applications, eliminating
the operational burden of manually deploying and managing the adapter, its
configuration, and RBAC. The automated solution handles the entire
lifecycle, making it simpler to scale applications based on the metrics that
matter most to your business.
Preview : Added support for fast failover for the egress NAT gateway
running in high availability. This feature improves both the reliability and
throughput of egress traffic.
GA : Added support for skip minor version cluster upgrades. You can
directly upgrade your cluster control plane nodes (and entire cluster if
worker node pools aren't pinned at a lower version) to two minor versions
above the current version. Added the bmctl upgrade
intermediate-version
command to print the intermediate version for a skip minor version upgrade.
Preview : Added support for advanced networking features on admin
clusters. This capability lets you specify multiple network interfaces for
Pods
and lets you use bundled load balancing with BGP
on your version 1.34 or higher admin clusters.

1.34
Change
The following functional changes were made in 1.34.0-gke.566:
Enabled Ansible SSH pipelining by default to improve performance. This can
be disabled by adding the annotation
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/ansible-ssh-pipelining: "disable" to the
Cluster custom resource.
During cluster creation and update operations, NodePools validate IP address
uniqueness against all existing underlay Nodes, regardless of status. Node
deprovisioning is blocked until the associated Kubernetes Node is deleted,
unless the node-deletion-timeout-seconds annotation is present on the
cluster.
Upgraded containerd from 1.7 to 2.0.
Registry mirror configuration information has been migrated to the
hosts.toml containerd config file.
Upgrade preflight checks now validate PodDisruptionBudgets.
GKE Identity Service has been migrated from a Deployment to a DaemonSet for
improved reliability on control plane nodes.
Added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.6.
Removed support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 as it is beyond the Red
Hat support
window .
Added support for the 6.14 kernel package is supported for use with Ubuntu
24.04 LTS.
1.34
Fixed
The following issues were fixed in 1.34.0-gke.566:
Updated the bmctl restore command so that it restores the Node Problem
Detector systemd Service for admin clusters.
Fixed the etcd-cleanup job timeout issue caused by the use of incorrect
certificates.
Fixed an issue where the cluster restore process leaves the Kubelet
certificate files as regular files instead of symbolic links, preventing
certificate rotation.

1.33
Feature
The following features were added in 1.33.0-gke.799:
GA : Introduced an Envoy sidecar into the GKE Identity Service to
increase security, reliability, and performance.
GA : Added support for the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS operating system with Linux
kernel versions, such as 6.8 and 6.11. Support for Linux kernel 6.14 is
explicitly excluded.
GA : Added the ability to override the cluster-level pod density setting
for individual node pools.
Preview : Added Node Agent to give you the ability to transition from
using Ansible over SSH for cluster operations to a more secure, agent-based
model. Added bmctl
nodeagent
commands to provide a straightforward and reliable process of migrating
existing clusters to use Node Agent.
Preview : Added a bundled version of the NVIDIA GPU Operator
(version 25.3.1). The bundled operator is an open-source solution for
managing the NVIDIA software components needed to provision and manage GPU
devices.
Preview : Added Dynamic Resource Allocation, a Kubernetes API that lets
you request and share generic resources, such as GPUs, among pods and
containers. When enabled, this capability helps you run AI workloads by
dynamically and precisely allocating the GPU resources within your bare
metal clusters, improving resource utilization and performance for demanding
workloads.
Preview : Added vertical Pod autoscaling, which lets you analyze and set
CPU and memory resources required by Pods. Instead of having to set
up-to-date CPU requests and limits and memory requests and limits for the
containers in your Pods, you can configure vertical Pod autoscaling to
provide recommended values for CPU and memory requests and limits that you
can use to manually update your Pods, or you can configure vertical Pod
autoscaling to automatically update the values.
Preview : Added support for skip minor version cluster upgrades. You can
directly upgrade your cluster control plane nodes (and entire cluster if
worker node pools aren't pinned at a lower version) to two minor versions

1.33
Fixed
The following issues were fixed in 1.33.0-gke.799:
Fixed an issue where restoring a cluster that has a node with a GPU causes
instability of pods on the nodes.
Fixed an issue that caused the Ansible playbook for handling Cloud Audit
Logging to fail and not complete.
Fixed an issue that caused nodes to get stuck in maintenance mode. Health
checks have been updated so that the network check job skips connectivity
checks for nodes that are in maintenance mode.
Fixed an issue where the CronJob for periodic health checks wasn't updating
after configuration changes.
Fixed vulnerabilities listed in Vulnerability
fixes .
1.33
Change
The following functional changes were made in 1.33.0-gke.799:
Changed logging behavior so that kubeadm logs show up in the journald of the
node machine where kubeadm runs.
To help prevent stale ARP cache issues, iptables-persistent is installed
in Debian nodes.
Cluster manifests are deployed using a Kubernetes job, allowing the cluster
operator to be more responsive to cluster events.
Updated the validation checks for cluster upgrades to enforce the cluster
version skew
rules
for user clusters. If the upgrade version information for a user cluster
doesn't comply with the version skew rules, the upgrade is halted.
Updated health checks and upgrade preflight checks to inspect for kubeadm
certificate expiration.
Updated etcd version to 3.5.21.
Removed support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 as it is beyond the Red
Hat support
window .
Removed support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as it has reached the end of standard
security maintenance in May
2025 .
Upgraded ansible-core to 2.16.4 to support Python 3.12.
Increased the RSA key size for Cluster API certifications to 4096 bits for
improved security.

Announcement
Version 1.29 end of life: In accordance with the Version Support Policy , version 1.29 (all patch releases) of Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal has reached its end of life and is no longer supported.
1.32
Feature
GA: Added support for new diagnosis utility for GKE Identity Service that provides diagnostics information related to the login flow. This makes it easier to troubleshoot login and OIDC configuration issues. For more information, see GKE Identity Service diagnostic utility .
GA: For high availability control planes, Google Distributed Cloud automatically configures the Keepalived virtual router redundancy protocol (VRRP) configuration to make failover behaviour deterministic and prevent interleaving of ARP replies with different MAC addresses:
By default, each Keepalived instance is configured with a different priority value.
Each Keepalived instance is configured with nopreempt to avoid elections when a non-master instance is restarted.
GA: Added support for a new field, controlPlane.loadBalancer.keepalivedVRRPGARPMasterRepeat , in the cluster configuration file that maps to the vrrp_garp_master_repeat setting for Keepalived. This field specifies the number of gratuitous ARP (GARP) messages to send at a time after a control plane node transitions to the role of the master server. The default value is 5 .
GA: Added a new controlPlane.loadBalancer.mode , field for Layer 2 load balancing. This field lets you separate control plane load balancing from data plane load balancing:
At cluster creation, if you set controlPlane.loadBalancer.mode to bundled and loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec is configured, the control plane load balancer runs in the control plane node pool and the data plane load balancer runs in the load balancer node pool.
For an existing cluster where controlPlane.loadBalancer.mode isn't set and loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec isn't specified, both the control plane load balancer and the data plane load balancer run in the control plane node pool. You can migrate the data plane load balancer to a load balancer node pool by updating the cluster spec to specify a load balancer node pool ( loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec ) and to add controlPlane.loadBalancer.mode set to bundled .
1.32
Fixed
Fixed an issue that resulted in an excessive creation of periodic kube-proxy-cleanup jobs on cluster nodes with high pod utilization.
Fixed an issue that caused cluster creation to fail because kubelet restarted before required static pods are running.
Fixed an issue where node upgrades failed due to a missing super-admin.conf file.
Fixed an issue where the bmctl update cluster command fails for user clusters that were created with the cloudOperationsServiceAccountKeyPath setting in the header section of the cluster configuration file.
Fixed an issue where prompting during bmctl update cluster prevented use of automation. You can now use the --quiet flag to skip prompting.
Fixed an issue where node machines didn't update when the registry mirror hosts field was updated.
The 1.32.0-gke.1086 release includes many vulnerability fixes. For a list of all vulnerabilities fixed in this release, see Vulnerability fixes .
1.32
Change
Upgraded etcd to v3.4.33-0-gke.3.
Upgraded containerd to version 1.7.
Upgraded the SR-IOV operator, sriov-network-operator , to version 1.4.
Added Compress=yes to /etc/systemd/journald.conf to ensure that objects larger than 512 bytes are compressed before they are written to the file system.
Added new, default periodic health checks to ensure that Kubernetes cluster resources are configured correctly and functioning properly.
Added more namespaces to the default snapshot scenarios.
Added preflight check for kernel fsnotify settings for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.x.
Removed the leading timestamp from the bmctl version response. Temporarily, we've provided -t and --timestamps flags to revert to the old format.
Added a check for the FailedCgroupRemoval node condition to the node problem detector (NPD) to look for orphan container processes on nodes. By default, a new plugin for NPD automatically fixes this condition on the node.
Updated the cluster delete process to delete worker node pools prior to removing any control plane nodes. This change applies to supported cluster deletion flows, including bmctl , the Google Cloud CLI, and the Google Cloud console.
Updated the log entries in the backup.log file created by the bmctl backup command to improve readability.
Updated the cluster upgrade operation to keep only the three latest kubeadm backups of etcd and configuration information for a node. Previously, kubeadm kept node backups for every attempted upgrade.
Added the kubelet config, CPU Manager state, and Memory Manager state to node snapshots.

1.31
Announcement
Version 1.28 end of life : In accordance with the Version Support Policy , version 1.28 (all patch releases) of Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal has reached its end of life and is no longer supported.
1.31
Change
Functionality changes:
(Edited: January 7, 2025) GKE Identity Service now requires that all HTTPS connections use transport layer security (TLS) 1.2 or 1.3. For versions 1.31.0 and higher, TLS 1.1 is disabled by default, however it can be re-enabled if needed.
If you require support for TLS 1.1, reach out to Cloud Customer Care for assistance.
Updated the bmctl push images command to check for the existence of an image digest to determine whether or not to push an image.
Increased priority for cert-manager pods to system-cluster-critical to prevent premature eviction under control plane node resource pressure.
Updated the logic for parsing the cluster configuration file for newer clusters to validate that the anthosBareMetalVersion value follows the full x.y.z-gke.n semantic versioning scheme, including the GKE patch version.
Updated the snapshot capability to collect the following information:
Details for all custom resources
Additional debugging information for clusters
Add a health check to check that the ifnode-problem-detector systemd service is running on the node.
Updated the bmctl update command to identify differences (if any) between the preview feature annotations in the cluster configuration file and the annotations in the deployed Cluster resource.
Added a --num-of-parallel-threads flag to the snapshot command ( bmctl check cluster --snapshot ) so that you can specify the number of threads to use to create a snapshot. The default number of threads for snapshot creation is 10.
1.31
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed an issue where the registry mirror reachability check fails for a single unreachable registry mirror. Now the reachability check applies to configured registry mirrors only, instead of all registry mirrors.
Fixed the issue where non-root users can't run bmctl restore to restore quorum.
Fixed the issue that caused the cplb-update healthcheck job to run every 7 days, instead when needed only.
Fixed an issue where CronJob specs for periodic health checks weren't updated to reflect cluster annotation changes.
Fixed an issue where the control plane VIP might become unavailable because Keepalived didn't check correctly that the VIP is on a node with a responsive HAProxy.
Fixed the issue where, due to a misconfigured client, bmctl update misjudges clusters about whether they're self-managed.
Fixed Cloud Audit Logging failure due to allowlisting issue with multiple project IDs.

Announcement
Release 1.30.400-gke.133
Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal 1.30.400-gke.133 is now available for download . To upgrade, see Upgrade clusters . Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal 1.30.400-gke.133 runs on Kubernetes 1.30.
After a release, it takes approximately 7 to 14 days for the version to become available for installations or upgrades with the GKE On-Prem API clients : the Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI, and Terraform.
If you use a third-party storage vendor, check the Ready storage partners document to make sure the storage vendor has already passed the qualification for this release of Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal.
1.30
Change
Functionality changes:
Updated snapshots to include new information, including: kubelet config, CPU manager state, and memory manager state.
Updated the bmctl push images command to check for the existence of an image digest to determine whether or not to push an image.
Added support for configuring the GKE Identity Service to enforce a minimum transport layer security (TLS) version of 1.2 for HTTPS connections. By default, the GKE Identity Service allows TLS 1.1 and higher connections. If you require enforcement for a minimum of TLS 1.2, reach out to Cloud Customer Care for assistance.
1.30
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed the issue where non-root users can't run bmctl restore to restore quorum.
Fixed an issue where CronJob specs for periodic health checks weren't updated to reflect cluster annotation changes.
Fixed an issue that blocked user cluster create and upgrade operations to patch versions 1.30.100, 1.30.200, or 1.30.300. This issue applies only when kubectl or a GKE On-Prem API client (console, gcloud CLI, or Terraform) is used for user cluster creation and upgrades.

1.30
Feature
New and updated features:
Preview: Added support for keyless mode for clusters. This feature uses short-lived tokens and Workload Identity Federation for your cluster and workload credentials, instead of the default long-lived service account keys and Kubernetes Secrets. This feature provides improved security and reduces credential maintenance.
Preview: Added support for Custom Scheduler Configuration for pods to automatically spread workloads across cluster nodes for increased reliability.
GA: Added support for admin and hybrid clusters to manage multiple versions of user clusters concurrently.
GA: Added support for node-level private registry configuration for workload images.
GA: Updated the bmctl update command to display the difference between the specs in the YAML cluster configuration file and the deployed Cluster resource. The diff covers the specs for both the Cluster resource and the NodePool resource.
GA: Added support for rolling back select node pool upgrades .
GA: Added support for specifying a session duration for Identity Service-issued tokens. You can set a session duration between 15 and 1440 minutes (24 hours). Shorter sessions provide better security (at the cost of more frequent reauthentication). Longer sessions reduce the frequency for reauthentication (at the cost of reduced security).
Preview: Updated the gcloud beta container fleet memberships get-credentials command to use a connect gateway preview feature that lets you run the kubectl attach , cp , and exec commands. For more information, see Limitations .
1.30
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed an issue where old, inoperable WebHook resources caused problems with cluster upgrades.
Fixed an issue where upgraded clusters didn't get label updates that match the labels applied for newly created clusters, for a given version.
Fixed an issue where service accounts created by using the --create-service-accounts flag with the bmctl create config command don't have enough permissions.
Fixed an issue where the kubelet doesn't honor shortened, 1-second grace period for pod deletion during eviction-based draining.
1.30
Change
Functionality changes:
Updated the node pool upgrade behavior. Version 1.30 and higher clusters, support all node pool versions from the preceding two minor versions. The preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/two-minor-version-node-pool: enable annotation isn't required when upgrading clusters from version 1.29 to version 1.30.
Updated the bmctl version command to return the metadata image digest in the response. To print only the metadata image digest only, specify the new --option value metadata-digest .
Deprecated the spec.gkeVersion field in the Machine custom resource. Starting with version 1.30.0, the spec.gkeVersion field is set to empty. For accurate version information, use anthosBareMetalVersion (GDC for bare metal version) in the Cluster resource spec or gkeVersion (Kubernetes version) in the Cluster resource status.
Updated Kubernetes audit logging to include request and response payloads from the Kubernetes API server for bare metal custom resources, such as Cluster , NodePool , BareMetalMachine , and BareMetalCluster .
Updated registry mirror support to allow you to specify a port for host addresses.
Updated the networking preflight check to verify that either the ip_tables or the nf_tables kernel module is available for loading, instead of being explicitly loaded.
Updated the stackdriver custom resource to remove the feature gate for using Managed Service for Prometheus for system metrics featureGates.GMPForSystemMetrics . This feature gate has defaulted to on ( true ) since version 1.16. If you have manually disabled using Managed Service for Prometheus for system metrics, upgrading to version 1.30 might be a breaking change for some system metrics formats. The field name in this note is incorrect, it should be enableGMPForSystemMetrics , instead of GMPForSystemMetrics ; see updated entry for March 25, 2025 .
Added checks to validate the SSH client certificate file type before saving the certificate as a Secret.
Updated GKE Identity Service custom resource definition to change the description for IdentityServiceOptions and improve formatting.
Added preflight checks for available disk space in specific directories:
During cluster creation, the following directories are checked:
/ (the root directory) has at least 4 GiB of free space
/var/log/fluent-bit-buffers has at least 12 GiB of free space
/var/opt/buffered-metrics has at least 10016 MiB of free space
During a cluster upgrade, the following directory is checked:
/ (the root directory) has at least 2 GiB of free space
GA: Adopted the GKE audit policy, instead of the previous unpopulated policy.

Announcement
Release 1.29.100-gke.251
GKE on Bare Metal 1.29.100-gke.251 is now available for download . To upgrade, see Upgrade clusters . GKE on Bare Metal 1.29.100-gke.251 runs on Kubernetes 1.29.
If you use a third-party storage vendor, check the GDCV Ready storage partners document to make sure the storage vendor has already passed the qualification for this release of GKE on Bare Metal.
1.29
Breaking
Added new API and IAM role requirements for Cloud Monitoring:
You must enable the kubernetesmetadata.googleapis.com API for your project and grant the roles/kubernetesmetadata.publisher IAM role to the Logging and Monitoring service account ( anthos-baremetal-cloud-ops , when created automatically). Clusters use this API as an endpoint to send Kubernetes metadata to Google Cloud. The metadata is vital for cluster monitoring, debugging, and recovery. If you install your clusters behind a proxy , add kubernetesmetadata.googleapis.com to the list of allowed connections.
Due to changes in the way service accounts are checked, you must also grant the following IAM roles to the Logging and Monitoring service account:
roles/monitoring.viewer
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer
These API and IAM role requirements apply to both creating new 1.29 clusters and upgrading existing clusters to 1.29.
1.29
Change
Functionality changes:
Added checks to validate the SSH client certificate file type before saving the certificate as a Secret.
Deprecated the spec.gkeVersion field in Machine and BareMetalMachine custom resources. After GKE on Bare Metal release 1.30, the value of gkeVersion isn't guaranteed to be reliable.
Added preflight checks for available disk space in specific directories:
During cluster creation, the following directories are checked:
/ (the root directory) has at least 4 GiB of free space
/var/log/fluent-bit-buffers has at least 12 GiB of free space
/var/opt/buffered-metrics has at least 10016 MiB of free space
During a cluster upgrade, the following directory is checked:
/ (the root directory) has at least 2 GiB of free space

April 29, 2024
1.29
Announcement
Release 1.29.0-gke.1449
GKE on Bare Metal 1.29.0-gke.1449 is now available for download . To upgrade, see Upgrade clusters . GKE on Bare Metal 1.29.0-gke.1449 runs on Kubernetes 1.29.
If you use a third-party storage vendor, check the GDCV Ready storage partners document to make sure the storage vendor has already passed the qualification for this release of GKE on Bare Metal.
1.29
Breaking
Added new API and IAM role requirements for Cloud Monitoring:
You must enable the kubernetesmetadata.googleapis.com API for your project and grant the roles/kubernetesmetadata.publisher IAM role to the Logging and Monitoring service account ( anthos-baremetal-cloud-ops , when created automatically). Clusters use this API as an endpoint to send Kubernetes metadata to Google Cloud. The metadata is vital for cluster monitoring, debugging, and recovery. If you install your clusters behind a proxy , add kubernetesmetadata.googleapis.com to the list of allowed connections.
Due to changes in the way service accounts are checked, you must also grant the following IAM roles to the Logging and Monitoring service account:
roles/monitoring.viewer
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer
These API and IAM role requirements apply to both creating new 1.29 clusters and upgrading existing clusters to 1.29.
1.29
Announcement
Version 1.15 end of life : In accordance with the Version Support Policy , version 1.15 (all patch releases) of GKE on Bare Metal has reached its end of life and is no longer supported.
1.29
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed an issue where the kubelet doesn't honor shortened, 1-second grace period for pod deletion during eviction-based draining.
Fixed a cluster upgrade issue where the lifecycle-controller-deployer Pod was unable to migrate existing GKE on Bare Metal resources to the latest API version. This issue blocked upgrades to earlier version 1.28 releases.
Fixed an issue with configuring a proxy for your cluster that required you to manually set HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY environment variables on the admin workstation.
Fixed an issue where upgrades are blocked because cluster-operator can't delete stale, failing preflight check resources.
Fixed an issue where the network check ConfigMap wasn't updated when nodes were added or removed.
1.29
Feature
GA : Support GKE Identity Service v2 capability for an improved security flow when you authenticate with third-party identity solutions.
The GA offering of GKE Identity Service v2 has the following requirements and restrictions:
GKE Identity Service v2 now requires ports 11001 and 11002 on the control plane load balancer nodes, instead of 8443 and 8444 . Ensure these ports are open and available before you upgrade a cluster to version 1.29.0-gke.1449 and higher. If the ports aren't open, upgrade preflight checks fail.
GKE Identity Service v2 requires version 1.5.1 or higher of the Anthos Auth gcloud CLI component. If necessary, update the Anthos Auth component ( gcloud components update anthos-auth ). If you use the Google Cloud SDK, updating the SDK ( gcloud components update ) to version 474.0.0 or later also updates the Anthos Auth component to the required version.
GKE Identity Service v2 doesn't work with GKE on Bare Metal clusters with the following configurations:
Clusters with a single control plane node only.
Clusters that use control plane nodes for load balancing. That is, clusters that aren't configured with either a separate load balancing node pool or manual load balancing.
GA : Added support for skews of up to two minor versions for selective node pool upgrades .
GA : Added capability to pause and resume cluster upgrades .
GA : Maintenance mode now uses eviction-based draining for nodes, instead of taint-based draining. Eviction-based draining uses the Eviction API, which honors Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs). Draining nodes this way provides better protection against workload disruptions.
Preview : Added support for node-level private registry configuration for workload images.
Preview : Added support for rolling back select node pool upgrades .
Preview : Added support for admin and hybrid clusters to manage multiple versions user clusters concurrently.
Preview : Added support for using an intermediate Certificate Authority (CA) as the cluster root CA.
Preview : Added support to route workload logs to a third-party custom Kafka destination. This capability isn't enabled by default. You enable this capability in the cluster stackdriver resource spec by adding the unmanagedKafkaOutputConfig section. This section lets you specify the IP addresses of Kafka message brokers ( brokers ), topic names ( topics ), and keys to map the topics to partitions ( topicKeys ).
Improved command-line interface errors and error documentation .
1.29
Change
Functionality changes:
GKE Identity Service v2 now sends extra parameters ( extraParams ) to your OIDC provider.
Extra node viewing permissions are added for accounts specified with the spec.clusterSecurity.authorization.clusterViewer.gcpAccounts field in the Cluster resource.
Added Status.Available field to BareMetalMachine resources to indicate whether the machine is available.
Updated preflight checks add a check for networking kernel modules ( ip_tables or np_tables ) and remove the iptables package check.
The Google plugin for the GKE Identity Service now caches the public keys based on max-age in cache-control header.

Announcement
Version alignment
For easier identification of the Kubernetes version for a given release, we are
aligning Anthos clusters on bare metal version numbering with GKE version numbering. This change
starts with this minor release, which is version 1.28. The version alignment is for major and minor versions only, patch versions are product specific. In addition to this version alignment, the Anthos clusters on bare metal release versions will follow the GKE semantic versioning scheme
(x.y.z-gke.N), including the addition of a GKE patch version (-gke.N). Unlike GKE,
however, the patch version (z) increments by 100.
Example version numbers for Anthos clusters on bare metal:
Minor release: 1.28.0-gke.435
Initial patch release: 1.28.100-gke.27
Second patch release: 1.28.200-gke.19
This change affects numbering only. Upgrades from 1.16 to 1.28 follow the same process as upgrades between prior minor releases. However, downloads, upgrades, and cluster creation for 1.28 and higher versions require the fully qualified version number, including the GKE patch version.
1.28
Announcement
Version 1.14 end of life : In accordance with the Anthos Version Support Policy, version 1.14 (all patch releases) of Anthos clusters on bare metal has reached its end of life and is no longer supported.
1.16
Change
Supported node pool versions:
If you use selective worker node pool upgrades to upgrade a cluster to version 1.16.4, see Node pool versioning rules for a list of the versions that are supported for the worker node pools.
1.16
Change
Functionality changes:
Changed upgrade preflight checks behavior to skip kubeadm job creation check to improve upgrade reliability.
1.28
Change
Supported node pool versions:
If you use selective worker node pool upgrades to upgrade a cluster to version 1.28.0-gke.435, see Node pool versioning rules for a list of the versions that are supported for the worker node pools.
1.28
Feature
Preview : Added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 9.2. For more information, see Select your operating system .
Preview : Added support for skews of up to two minor versions for selective node pool upgrades .
Preview : Added capability to pause and resume cluster upgrades .
GA : Added support for using custom cluster certificate authorities (CAs) to enable secure authentication and encryption between cluster components.
GA : Added support for using gkeConnect.location to specify regional membership for fleets.
GA : Added support for using controlPlane.apiServerCertExtraSANs to specify extra subject alternative name (SAN) entries for the Kubernetes API server certificate.
GA : Added support for enabling Direct Server Return (DSR) load balancing for clusters. In GA, DSR load balancing is enabled with the clusterNetwork.forwardMode field in the cluster configuration file.
GA : Added support for multiple BGP load balancer ( BGPLoadBalancer ) resources and BGP Community. Multiple BGP load balancer resources provide more flexibility to define which peers advertise specific load balancer nodes and Services. BGP Community support helps you to distinguish routes coming from BGP load balancers from other routes in your network.
Preview : Added GKE Identity Service v2 capability for an improved security flow when you authenticate with third-party identity solutions.
Warning: GKE Identity Service v2 requires ports 8443 and 8444 on the control plane load balancer nodes. Ensure these ports are open and available before you upgrade a cluster to version 1.28.0-gke.435 and higher. If the ports aren't open, upgrade preflight checks fail.
1.28
Change
Functionality changes:
Configured the local volume provisioner DaemonSet to tolerate all taints.
Updated the SRIOV operator.
To improve logging system integration, updated audit logging to always write a local Kubernetes audit log file, even when Cloud Audit Logging is enabled.
Changed upgrade preflight checks behavior to skip kubeadm job creation check to improve upgrade reliability.
Updated Dataplane V2 to use Cilium v1.13.
Added preflight check for control planes running RHEL 9.2 or Ubuntu 22.04 to check the fs.inotify kernel settings.
Note: Preflight check updates for new features or capabilities aren't an indication that a given feature or capability is supported. Added support for new features and capabilities are called out separately in release notes with their corresponding support phase (Preview or GA).
Removed hardcoded timeout value for bmctl backup operation.
Updated certificate management to propagate private-registry-certs Secret changes to all machines.
Added support for SSH client certificates in bmctl backup and bmctl restore commands.
Added the optional userClaim field to the ClientConfig custom resource definition bundled with Anthos clusters on bare metal. This change improves support for Azure AD integrations with Anthos Identity Service.
Updated constraint on NodePool spec.upgradeStrategy.concurrentNodes to be the smaller of either 15 nodes or 50% of the size of the node pool.
1.16
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed an issue where the network check ConfigMap wasn't being updated when nodes were added or removed.

Release 1.16.0
Anthos clusters on bare metal 1.16.0 is now available for download . To upgrade, see Upgrading Anthos on bare metal . Anthos clusters on bare metal 1.16.0 runs on Kubernetes 1.27.
If you use a third-party storage vendor, check the GDCV Ready storage partners document to make sure the storage vendor has already passed the qualification for this release of GKE on Bare Metal.
1.16
Change
Supported node pool versions:
If you use selective worker node pool upgrades to upgrade a cluster to version 1.16.4, see Node pool versioning rules for a list of the versions that are supported for the worker node pools.
1.16
Feature
Cluster lifecycle:
Upgraded to Kubernetes version 1.27.4.
Added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 8.8.
GA: Added support for parallel upgrades of worker node pools .
GA: Added support to upgrade specific worker node pools separately from the rest of the cluster .
GA: Added a separate instance of etcd for the etcd-events object. This new etcd instance is always on and requires ports 2382 and 2383 to be open on control plane nodes for inbound TCP traffic. If these ports aren't opened, cluster creation and cluster upgrades are blocked.
GA: Updated preflight checks for cluster installation and upgrades to use changes from the latest Anthos clusters on bare metal patch version to address known issues and provide more useful checks.
GA: Support enrolling admin and user clusters in the Anthos On-Prem API automatically to enable cluster lifecycle management from the Google Cloud CLI, the Google Cloud console, and Terraform when the Anthos On-Prem API is enabled. If needed, you have the option to disable enrollment. For more information, see the description for the gkeOnPremAPI field in the cluster configuration file.
GA: Added ability to configure kubelet image pull settings for node pools. For more information, see Configure kubelet image pull settings .
Added new health check to detect any unsupported drift in the custom resources managed by Anthos clusters on bare metal. Unsupported resource changes can lead to cluster problems.
Added a new flag, --target-cluster-name , that is supported by the bmctl register bootstrap command.
Networking:
GA: Added support for Services of type LoadBalancer to use externalTrafficPolicy=Local with bundled load balancing with BGP .
Preview: Added support for enabling Direct Server Return (DSR) load balancing for clusters configured with flat-mode networking. DSR load balancing is enabled with an annotation, preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/dpv2-lbmode-dsr: enable .
Preview: Upgraded wherabouts to v0.6.1-gke.1 to support dual-stack networking.
Added support for multiple BGP load balancer ( BGPLoadBalancer ) resources and BGP Community. Multiple BGP load balancer resources provide more flexibility to define which peers advertise specific load balancer nodes and Services. BGP Community support helps you to distinguish routes coming from BGP load balancers from other routes in your network.
Observability:
Important: As part of the following change, many metrics have shifted monitored resource types from Kubernetes Container ( k8s_container ) to Prometheus Target ( prometheus_target ). In some cases, this resource change can cause existing dashboards to stop working properly until they are adjusted to use the metrics for the prometheus_target resource.
GA: Added support for system metrics when you use Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus.
Security and Identity:
GA: Added support for Binary Authorization, a service on Google Cloud that provides software supply-chain security for container-based applications. For more information, see Set up Binary Authorization policy enforcement .
GA: Added support for VPC Service Controls , which provides additional security for your clusters to help mitigate the risk of data exfiltration.
Preview: Added support for using custom cluster certificate authorities (CAs) to enable secure authentication and encryption between cluster components.
Preview: Added support for configuring the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) of the kubeadm generated certificate for the kube-apiserver.
Added support to run keepalived as a non-root user.
1.16
Change
Functionality changes:
Updated constraint on NodePool spec.upgradeStrategy.concurrentNodes to be the smaller of 15 nodes or 50% of the size of the node pool.
Replaced legacy method of enabling application logging in the cluster configuration file with two fields, enableCloudLoggingForApplications and enableGMPForApplications , in the stackdriver custom resource.
The spec.clusterOperations.enableApplication field in the cluster configuration file has no effect on version 1.16.0 and higher clusters. This field populated the enableStackdriverForApplications field in the stackdriver
custom resource, which enabled annotation based workload metric
collection. If you need this capability, use the annotationBasedApplicationMetrics feature gate
in the stackdriver custom resource as shown in the following sample to keep the same
behavior:
kind:stackdriver
spec :
enableCloudLoggingForApplications : true
featureGates :
annotationBasedApplicationMetrics : true
Caution: The annotation-based workload metrics collection enabled by the annotationBasedApplicationMetrics feature gate collects metrics for objects that have the prometheus.io/scrape annotation. Many software systems with open source origin may use this annotation. Be aware of this dependency so that you aren't surprised by metrics charges in Cloud Monitoring.
Added optional ksmNodePodMetricsOnly feature gate in the stackdriver custom resource to reduce the number of metrics from kube-state-metrics. Reducing the number of metrics makes monitoring pipeline more stable in large scale clusters.
Audit logs are compressed on the wire for Cloud Audit Logs consumption, reducing egress bandwidth by approximately 60%.
Upgraded local volume provisioner to v2.5.0.
Upgraded snapshot controller to v5.0.1.
Deprecated v1beta1 volume snapshot custom resources. Anthos clusters on bare metal will stop serving v1beta1 resources in a future release.
Removed resource request limits on edge profile workloads.
Added preflight check to make sure control plane and load balancer nodes aren't under maintenance before an upgrade.
Updated the cluster snapshot capability so that information can be captured for the target cluster even when the cluster custom resource is missing or unavailable.
Improved bmctl error reporting for failures during the creation of a bootstrap cluster.
Added support for using the baremetal.cluster.gke.io/maintenance-mode-deadline-seconds cluster annotation to specify the maximum node draining duration, in seconds. By default, a 20-minute (1200 seconds) timeout is enforced. When the timeout elapses, all pods are stopped and the node is put into maintenance mode. For example to change the timeout to 10 minutes, add the annotation baremetal.cluster.gke.io/maintenance-mode-deadline-seconds: "600" to your cluster.
Updated bmctl check cluster to create a HealthCheck custom resource in the admin cluster if it's healthy.
1.16
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed an issue where the apiserver could become unresponsive during a cluster upgrade for clusters with a single control plane node.
Fixed an issue where cluster installations or upgrades fail when the cluster name has more than 45 characters.
Fixed an issue where the control plane VIP wasn't reachable during cluster installation on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Fixed an issue where audit logs were duplicated into the offline buffer even when they are sent to Cloud Audit Logs successfully.
Fixed an issue where node-specific labels set on the node pool were sometimes overwritten.
Updated avoidBuggyIPs and manualAssign fields in load balancer address pools ( spec.loadBalancers.addressPools ) to allow changes at any time.
Fixed an issue where containerd didn't restart when there was a version mismatch. This issue caused an inconsistent containerd version within the cluster.
Fixed an issue that caused the logging agent to use continuously increasing amounts of memory.
Fixed preflight check so that it no longer ignores the no_proxy setting.
Fixed Anthos Identity Service annotation needed for exporting metrics.
Fixed an issue that caused the bmctl restore command to stop responding for clusters with manually configured load balancers.
Fixed an issue that prevented Anthos clusters on bare metal from restoring a high-availability quorum for nodes that use /var/lib/etcd as a mountpoint.
Fixed an issue that caused health checks to report failure when they find a Pod with a status of TaintToleration even when the replicaset for the Pod has sufficient Pods running.
Fixed an issue that caused conflicts with third-party Ansible automation.
Fixed a cluster upgrade issue that prevented some control plane nodes from rejoining a cluster configured for high availability.

1.15
Change
Functionality changes:
Updated the cluster snapshot capability so that information can be captured for the target cluster even when the cluster custom resource is missing or unavailable.
Improved bmctl error reporting for failures during the creation of a bootstrap cluster.
Added support for using the baremetal.cluster.gke.io/maintenance-mode-deadline-seconds cluster annotation to specify the maximum node draining duration, in seconds. By default, a 20-minute (1200 seconds) timeout is enforced. When the timeout elapses, all pods are stopped and the node is put into maintenance mode. For example to change the timeout to 10 minutes, add the annotation baremetal.cluster.gke.io/maintenance-mode-deadline-seconds: "600" to your cluster.
Added node_pool_name to the anthos_baremetal_node_os_count metric.
1.15
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed an issue that caused the bmctl restore command to stop responding for clusters with manually configured load balancers.
Fixed an issue that caused health checks to report failure when they find a Pod with a status of TaintToleration even when the replicaset for the Pod has sufficient Pods running.
Fixed an issue that prevented Anthos clusters on bare metal from restoring a high-availability quorum for nodes that use /var/lib/etcd as a mountpoint.
Fixed an issue that caused conflicts with third-party Ansible automation.
Fixed an issue where invalid kubelet image pull settings , such as negative values, resulted in update job failures. Unchecked job failures generate an excessive accumulation of kubelet configuration backup files.
Fixed a cluster upgrade issue that prevented some control plane nodes from rejoining a cluster configured for high availability.

Issue
1.14.0 Upgrade problem
Control plane nodes for Anthos clusters on bare metal use Kubernetes taints to prevent workload pods from being scheduled on them. When you upgrade version 1.13 Anthos clusters to version 1.14.0, the control plane nodes lose required taints. We recommend that you skip upgrading to version 1.14.0 and upgrade to version 1.14.1 directly.
This problem doesn't cause upgrade failures, but pods that aren't supposed to run on the control plane nodes may start doing so. These workload pods can overwhelm control plane nodes and lead to cluster instability. This issue has security implications, as well. We strongly recommend that you not upgrade your clusters to version 1.14.0, but upgrade instead to a subsequent release version with the fix.
For more information about the issue, including workaround instructions, see the Clusters upgraded to 1.14.0 lose master taints known issue.

Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed an issue with the anthos-cluster-operator that caused CertificateSigningRequest (CSR) events to be missed during reconciliation steps. The lack of signing resulted in Istio crashlooping.
Fixed an issue that prevented the Pod CIDR for nodes from being adjusted from the default /24 mask size to account for the maxPodsPerNode cluster setting.
Fixed an issue that removed taints from control plane nodes when upgrading clusters to version 1.14.0.

Change
Functionality changes:
Changed the behavior for periodic health checks during upgrades. Now, during the upgrade process, existing periodic health checks continue to run in the admin cluster. Once the cluster is upgraded to the next version, the previous version periodic health checks are replaced with periodic health checks for the new version.
Lowered the priority of health check jobs to minimize contention for resources.
Changed the etcd history compaction interval from the default of 5 minutes to 2.5 minutes. This value is set in the kube-apiserver.yaml file.

Feature
Improved cluster lifecycle functionalities:
Upgraded from Kubernetes version 1.24 to 1.25.
Enabled customers to run the latest health and preflight checks by running the command bmctl check cluster –check-image-version=latest . Setting the check-image-version flag to 'latest' ensures that clusters are examined for more recent issues, including issues discovered after a release.
Preview: Added support of Control group v2 (cgroup v2).
GA: Added automatic reservation of CPU and memory resources on cluster nodes so that system daemons have the resources they require.
Optimized the consumption of resources by components such as cluster-operator , cap-manager , preflight-check operator , and lifecycle-controllers-manager .
GA: Enabled automatic and periodic health checks on all clusters.
Networking:
Preview: Added support for turning on kube-proxy-free mode for cluster objects. WARNING: This operation is not reversible. Once enabled, it cannot be disabled.
Changed behavior of Dataplane V2 so that it drops a packet if no service backends are available. Previously, the packet was passed to the kernel stack.
Enabled automatic API rate limit adjustments in Dataplane V2.
Observability:
Added severity level to container logs.
Enabled collection of uptime and other Kubernetes resource metrics from the kubelet summary API.
Enabled Stackdriver log forwarder in the bootstrap cluster. This log forwarder publishes bootstrap container logs to Cloud Logging.
Security and Identity:
GA: Added feature enabling cluster administrators to configure RBAC policies based on Azure Active Directory (AD) groups. Groups information for users belonging to more than 200 groups can now be retrieved.
GA: Added secure computing mode (seccomp) support. Running containers with a seccomp profile improves the security of a cluster because it restricts the system calls that containers are allowed to make to the kernel.
Added annotation in the cluster configuration file which allows customers to disable the kubelet read-only port. After disabling the read-only port, customers have to change their cluster configurations so that workloads use the kubelet secure port.
VM Runtime:
GA: Added support for guest OS booting of UEFI. Previously, only BIOS was supported.
Preview: Enabled Terraform scripting to create VMs on an Anthos cluster. For more information, including usage instructions, an input reference, and examples, see the terraform-google-anthos-vm GitHub repository.
Preview: Add support for non-uniform memory access (NUMA) awareness. When enabled, all communication within the VM is local to the NUMA node, thus avoiding the performance cost of data transactions with remote memory locations.
Preview: Enabled multicast traffic for VMs.
Added Anthos VM Runtime preflight checks to validate hardware accelerator configuration.
Enabled configuration of storage's volume mode (block or filesystem) and access modes, such as RWO and RWX.
Enabled means to configure the storage class of a scratch space. A scratch space is sometimes required when importing or uploading a VM disk image.
Added support for configuring cloud-init , using virtctl .
Enabled ability to disable auto-installation of the guest agent binary. After the initial guest agent installation, you can set the autoInstallGuestAgent flag to false so that the binary doesn't mount in subsequent restarts.
Enabled the support of multiple network interfaces, by default, for all clusters.
Improved security for creating a VM with kubectl virt create . If an initial password is specified, it is now stored in a secret and not as a VM annotation.
Reduced the permissions of the network controller.
Changed default to always use Asynchronous IO mode (AIO) in order to reduce QEMU memory pressure.
Added VM creation and disk provisioning times to Prometheus metrics.
Added support for the Tesla T4 GPU.
Enabled reset of GPU card to its original status when GPU functionality is disabled.
Enabled ability to disable Anthos VM Runtime when it's in the enabling state and custom resource definitions haven't yet been installed.
Added the following command, which allows you to display the VM screen: kubectll virt vnc --screenshot VM_NAME .
Fixed the IP address update for Windows guest VMs.
Resolved the MacVTap interface creation failure which occurred when the name of the interface was too long.
Fixed attaching VM disk using SATA driver.
Fixed issue so that setting disableCDIUploadProxyVIP to true correctly disables the cdi-uploadproxy service.
Fixed issue so that specifying a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) with an empty underlying PersistentVolume (PV) correctly creates the underlying empty disk format (raw or qcow2).
Enforced VM names to follow the standard RFC1123 format.
Fixed issue so that ISO image is correctly imported from a Cloud Storage bucket.
Fixed benign crash looping of the NVIDIA device plugin and the Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) manager when all GPU cards are allocated to a VM.
Fixed issue so that virt-launcher Pod can be created when advanced compute is enabled.

1.13
Feature
Release 1.13.0
Anthos clusters on bare metal 1.13.0 is now available for download . To upgrade, see Upgrading Anthos on bare metal . Anthos clusters on bare metal 1.13.0 runs on Kubernetes 1.24.
1.13
Announcement
The dockershim component in Kubernetes enables cluster nodes to use the Docker Engine container runtime. However, Kubernetes 1.24 removed the dockershim component.
Since Anthos clusters on bare metal version 1.13 runs on Kubernetes 1.24, version 1.13 and higher clusters can no longer use Docker Engine as a container runtime. All clusters must use the default container runtime containerd.
1.13
Feature
Improved cluster lifecycle functionalities:
Upgraded from Kubernetes version 1.23 to 1.24:
Reverted some of the changes Kubernetes and the kubeadm tool made to certain labels and taints on control plane nodes. Changes were reverted so that older versions of Anthos clusters on bare metal remain supported. As a result, control plane nodes have the following labels and taints:
node-role.kubernetes.io/master label
node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane label
node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule taint
Upgraded from kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2 to kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3 since the former is deprecated.
Stopped automatic generation of Secret API objects containing service account tokens for every Service Account. For more information, see the LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration section of the upgrade notes .
Breaking change: Version 1.12 clusters that use Docker Engine can upgrade to 1.13 only if the new container runtime is specified as containerd . Blocked the creation of new 1.13 clusters that use Docker Engine as the container runtime.
Preview: Added feature so that upgrades of an admin/hybrid/standalone cluster can proceed without a bootstrap cluster. Management of Anthos clusters on bare metal is now fully conformant to the Kubernetes Resource Model .
Added support of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6.
Removed an erroneous CustomResourceDefinition ( app.k8s.io.Application ) from inclusion in the cluster creation process.
Fixed vulnerability to YAML injection by switching to safetext/yamltemplate .
GA: Added support for installing Anthos clusters on bare metal, using your own registry service, instead of gcr.io . For instructions and additional information, see Use a registry mirror to create clusters .
Eliminated false error messaging when the bmctl create cluster is run. The message erroneously reported an Invalid value in the spec.labels field of NodePool specifications.
Added a webhook check to prevent worker node pools from being added to an Admin cluster inadvertently.
Added feature so that resetting a user cluster doesn't require the cluster configuration file.
Reduced containerd disk usage by having containerd store just the uncompressed layers of an image rather than both the compressed and uncompressed layers.
Upgraded containerd to version 1.6.6.
Networking:
GA: Enabled Dynamic Flat IP with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) support. This feature lets you configure flat mode using BGP in clusters by leveraging Network Gateway Group and BGP. In this mode the Pod's IP address is visible and routable without masquerading across multiple subdomains. Currently supports advertising IPv4 and IPv6 routes over IPv4 sessions.
GA: Added BGP-based Load Balancer support for IPv6.
Added ability to disable the Bundled Ingress feature. Customers should disable this feature if they are using full Anthos Service Mesh (ASM) instead. (Bundled Ingress is unnecessary when full ASM is installed).
Observability:
Preview: Added support of multi-line parsing for Go and Java logs.
GA: Added support for Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus (GMP) for application metrics.
Refined kube-state-metrics so that only core metrics are collected by default.
Security:
GA: Added Google Groups support for Connect Gateway.
Switched distroless base image for Node Problem Detector.
Changed anet-operator/cilium-operator to run as non-root container.
Secured communication between metrics-server and api-server using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
VM Runtime:
Fixed a memory leak in libvirt-go , which caused unbounded memory growth and risked crashing long-running VMs.
Provided guaranteed compute support so that customers can get Guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) for the VM when needed.
Preview: Enabled Anthos VM to be allocated dedicated host cores. Each VM virtual core can be pinned to a dedicated host core.
Separated GPU installation and deletion logic. If only the container GPU workload is needed, customers can enable the GPU without having to enable VM Runtime.
Added support for the T4 GPU card.
Enabled automatic use of the VirtualMachineDisk name as the disk serial number. This change makes it easier for customers to identify the disk in the VM.
Enabled KubeVM cloud-init API and startup script API.
Added new CLI command ( Virtctl ) for resetting Windows VM password.
Fixed the following container image security vulnerability: CVE-2022-1798
Added feature that stops NVIDIA device plugins from crashing if a GPU card hasn't been allocated to a container.
Added support for automatic VM restarts after a configuration update. Previously, customers needed to stop the VM, apply the change, and then re-start the VM. To use the feature, set the autoRestartOnConfigurationChange flag to true in the VirtualMachine custom resource.
Improved the Kubernetes audit log of VM operations so that it contains detailed VM configuration and update information.
Fixed flooding of logs with cluster events that arise when a VM encounters disk I/O errors.
Added KubeVM roles. By binding with these roles, customers are granted permission to resources that manage VMs.

Announcement
The dockershim component in Kubernetes enables cluster nodes to use the Docker Engine container runtime. However, Kubernetes 1.24 removed the dockershim component. Starting from Anthos clusters on bare metal 1.12.0, you will not be able to create new clusters that use the Docker Engine container runtime. All new clusters should use the default container runtime containerd .
1.12
Feature
Improved cluster lifecycle functionalities:
Upgraded Anthos clusters on bare metal to use Kubernetes version 1.23.
Upgraded container runtime to containerd 1.5.
Updated preflight check to forward default SSH key if no key is provided.
Added support for new GCPAccounts field in the cluster configuration file. This field enables the assignment of a cluster-admin role to end-users.
Added labels to control plane, control plane load balancer, and load balancer node pools, so that these different node pools can be distinguished from each other.
Added nodepool reference label to nodes so that worker nodes can be listed in the UI.
Observability:
GA: Added Summary API metrics. These metrics are scraped from the Kubernetes Summary API and provide CPU, memory, and storage metrics for Pods, containers, and Nodes.
Added separate flags to enable logging and monitoring for user applications separately: EnableCloudLoggingForApplications and EnableGMPForApplications . The legacy flag EnableStackdriverForApplications will be deprecated and removed in future releases.
Preview: Added Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus to collect application metrics and monitor cluster health.
Upgraded GKE Metrics Agent (gke-metrics-agent) from version 1.1.0 to 1.8.3. This tool scrapes metrics from each cluster node and publishes them in Cloud Monitoring .
Added the following resource utilization metrics. For more information about these and other metrics, see View Anthos clusters on bare metal metrics :
container/cpu/request_utilization
container/cpu/limit_utilization
container/memory/request_utilization
container/memory/limit_utilization
node/cpu/allocatable_utilization
node/memory/allocatable_utilization
pod/volume/utilization
Added sample dashboards for monitoring cluster health to Cloud Monitoring sample dashboards . Customers can install these dashboards with one click.
Scoped down the RBAC permissions of stackdriver-operator , a component that performs logging and monitoring.
Security:
AIS CA deprecation. AIS certs are now signed by cluster CA.
Changed ca-rotation container image so that it uses a distroless rather than a Debian-based image.
RBAC permissions of the cluster-operator component have been eliminated or reduced to address elevated permissions.
GA: Anthos Identity Service LDAP authentication support .
Networking:
Preview: Enabled creation of IPv6 and Dual Stack LoadBalancer services. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used for Dualstack clusters. Advertising IPv4 and IPv6 routes over IPv4 sessions is supported.
Preview: Added Network Connectivity Gateway feature support to provide HA VPN between Google Cloud and an on-premises Anthos cluster.

1.11
Announcement
If you have Anthos VM Runtime enabled for your Anthos clusters on bare metal, you must disable it before upgrading clusters to version 1.11.2 or higher. If this step is not completed, your cluster upgrade will fail. You can re-enable Anthos VM Runtime after the upgrade is complete.
1.11
Announcement
Starting with Anthos clusters on bare metal release 1.11.2, you can enable or disable Anthos VM Runtime by updating the VMRuntime custom resource only. The legacy spec.kubevirt settings in the cluster configuration are no longer supported. The VMRuntime custom resource is installed by default on version 1.10 and later hybrid, standalone, and user clusters. The VMRuntime custom resource can't be applied to admin clusters.
1.11
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed cluster custom resource status reporting for pending reconciliations.
Fixed a bmctl check cluster command issue that caused the user cluster kubeconfig Secret to be overwritten.
Fixed an issue with manifest installation when last-applied-config is broken that caused upgrades to fail.
Fixed an issue to ensure that the 20-minute timeout for node draining is enforced during cluster upgrades. This timeout provides ample time for nodes to drain, but ensures that upgrades can always proceed.
1.11
Announcement
Starting with Anthos clusters on bare metal release 1.11.2, the Anthos VM Runtime API version has changed from v1alpha1 to v1 . This version change doesn't affect the VMRuntime custom resource, but most other resources are affected.

1.11
Announcement
On January 31, 2022, CentOS 8 reached its end of life (EOL). As a result of the EOL, yum repositories stopped working for CentOS, which causes cluster creation and cluster upgrade operations to fail. For a workaround and more information, see Cluster creation or upgrades fail on CentOS .
1.11
Announcement
Containerd is the default runtime in Anthos clusters on bare metal. Support for Docker as a container runtime on Kubernetes nodes will be removed from Anthos clusters on bare metal starting with version 1.13.0. If you use a node image based on Docker container runtime, please migrate your workloads to a Containerd node image as soon as possible. For more details, see Containerd node images .
1.11
Feature
Improved cluster lifecycle functionalities:
Upgraded Anthos clusters on bare metal to use Kubernetes version 1.22.
Updated cert-manager to version 1.5.4.
Added error messaging in the bmctl command line interface to better surface cluster installation or upgrade failure.
Incorporated audit logs into bmctl snapshots.
Added ability for registry mirror users to customize containerd configuration and have it automatically mirror public registry hosts other than gcr.io .
Changed bmctl update command so that it extracts manifests before updating a cluster.
Added feature so that a cluster kubeconfig file automatically renews when the cluster is upgraded and the kubeconfig Secret is renewed whenever cluster reconciliation takes place.
Added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS 8.5.
Added warning to bmctl command that docker containerRuntime will not be supported in version 1.13 of Anthos cluster on bare metal.
Added support for specifying CIDR blocks in the NoProxy section of the cluster's configuration file.
Added Service CIDR to NoProxy section of a cluster configuration file by default in order to fix a multinic in proxy environment issue.
Fixed a multi-NIC in proxy environment issue. Whenever the NO_PROXY environment variable is set, it includes the Service CIDR from the cluster specification.
Networking:
GA: Added egress Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway capability to provide persistent, deterministic routing for egress traffic from clusters. For more information, see Configure an egress NAT gateway for external communication .
GA: Added option for BGP bundled load balancer which advertises Load Balancer (LB) Virtual IP addresses (VIPs) to the network using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). This feature supports topologies across multiple subnets and can provide greater load-balancing bandwidth than bundled Layer 2 mode.
GA: Enabled SR-IOV. This feature allows you to configure Virtual Functions (VFs) on the supported devices on the nodes of their cluster. It also allows you to define the kernel module you want to bind to the VF.
GA: Enabled IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack support. Clusters can be deployed in a dual-stack network in which IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are assigned to both nodes and pods. By default, IPv4 is in island mode and IPv6 is in flat mode (a simplified network topology).
GA: Enabled static flat network (without BGP). This feature lets you configure a flat mode network for IPv4 addresses. A pod's IPv4 address is visible and routable within the same Layer 2 domain, without having to masquerade as the node's IP address.
Preview: Enabled Dynamic Flat IP with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) support. This feature lets you configure flat mode using BGP in clusters with the help of Anthos Network Gateway and BGP. In this mode, the pod's IP address is visible and routable without masquerading across multiple subdomains. Currently supports advertising IPv4 and IPv6 routes over IPv4 sessions.
Fixed issue in which new MAC addresses of re-imaged nodes weren't updated.
Observability:
GA: Enabled collection of multiple network interfaces (multinic) logs from clusters. Logs are collected as system logs and are sent to Cloud Logging without charge to the customer.
Preview: Added Summary API metrics. These metrics provide CPU, memory, and storage statistics about pods, containers, and nodes.
Updated fluent-bit ( stackdriver-log-forwarder ) cri parser to avoid matching time fields multiple times.
Upgraded kube-state-metrics from version 1.9 to 2.4. This service generates metrics about Kubernetes API objects such as deployments, nodes, and pods.
Upgraded Metric Server from version 0.3.6 to 0.4.5. Metrics Server retrieves metrics from kubelets and exposes them through the Kubernetes Metrics API.
Security:
Preview: Added secure computing mode ( seccomp ) support. Running containers with a seccomp profile improves the security of a cluster because it restricts the system calls that containers are allowed to make to the kernel.
Added ability to disable rootless mode for system containers. Since version 1.10.0, Kubernetes control planes and Anthos clusters on bare metal system containers run as non-root containers by default.
Fixed CA rotation issues by increasing the ca-rotation timeout for admin clusters. While verifying that a static pod has been restarted after manifest update, the current hash is retrieved before the manifest changes are applied.

1.10
Breaking
Breaking changes:
The gateway capability used by the egress NAT gateway and Bundled load balancing with BGP Preview features have changed in this release. The NetworkGatewayGroup custom resource replaces AnthosNetworkGateway and the capability is enabled with a new advancedNetworking field in the cluster configuration file, instead of an annotation. These changes affect the ability to upgrade clusters that use earlier versions of the features.
Anthos clusters on bare metal blocks cluster upgrades from version 1.9 to version 1.10 for clusters that use either of these two advanced networking features. You can upgrade a version 1.9 admin cluster that is managing 1.9 user clusters that use these features to version 1.10, but object reconciliation breaks for the AnthosNetworkGateway custom resource. Object reconciliation is the mechanism whereby admin clusters automatically copy/restore objects on managed user clusters when the objects have been defined alongside the cluster configuration. Any AnthosNetworkGateway custom resources are still functional and can be modified with kubectl .
To bring a version 1.9 cluster that uses either advanced networking Preview feature up to version 1.10, reset or delete the cluster and create a new 1.10 cluster.
Preview features and products are subject to change and are provided for testing and evaluation purposes only. Do not use Preview features on your production clusters.

Issue
Known issues:
For information about the latest known issues, see Anthos on bare metal known issues in the Troubleshooting section.
1.10
Feature
Improved cluster lifecycle functionalities:
GA: Enabled Node Problem Detector to run by default on all nodes. You can check if a problem was detected on a node by running the kubectl describe command for the node. Then look for NodeConditions or Events reported by Node Problem Detector.
GA: Added bmctl backup cluster and bmctl restore cluster commands to facilitate disaster recovery for clusters.
Preview: Added the ability to reset individual nodes using the SSH key.
Updated the bmctl check cluster command so that the snapshot of a cluster includes the cluster's YAML file and logs that are in the bmctl-workspace directory.
Added a new status field cluster.gkeHubRegistrationStatus . The command kubectl get cluster now shows information about the cluster's membership to GKE Hub.
Networking:
Preview: Enabled Anthos multi-cluster connectivity to provide Anthos clusters a way to connect to another Anthos cluster in the same data center (intra-site, cluster-to-cluster). Pods in connected clusters can reach each other over pod IP addresses without using native address translation (NAT) in between.
Preview: Enabled IPv4/IPv6 dual stack support. Customers can deploy clusters in a dual-stack network, where IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be assigned to both nodes and pods.
Preview: Enabled "flat mode" (a simplified network topology) for IPv4 , where the pod's IPv4 address is visible and routable without masquerading as node IP within the same Layer 2 domain.
Preview: Enabled SR-IOV. This feature lets you configure Virtual Functions (VFs) on the supported devices on the nodes of their cluster. This feature also lets you define the kernel module you want to bind to the VF.
Observability:
GA: Added ability to show severity level of an issue in Cloud Logging. Severity level is extracted from containerd and kubelet node logs.
GA: Changed collection of application metrics to use a more scalable monitoring pipeline based on OpenTelemetry. This change significantly reduces the amount of resources required to collect metrics.
Security:
GA: Enhanced the capability to rotate cluster certificate authorities (CAs). Updates include support for all cluster types, rotation of front-proxy and etcd CAs, and changes to the bmctl command syntax.
Preview: Enabled installation of Anthos clusters on bare metal using a short-lived Google Service Account token instead of using Google Service Account keys.
Enabled Kubernetes control plane and most Anthos system containers to run as non-root users. For details, see Don't run containers as root user .
VM Runtime:
Preview: Supported enabling or disabling Anthos VM Runtime on user clusters.
Preview: Enabled Anthos VM Runtime to support QEMU Copy On Write (QCOW2) format, which is a storage format for virtual disks on virtual machines. Some benefits of virtual disk capabilities are independent thin provisioning, better compression, and encryption at rest.
Preview: Enabled VMRuntime custom resource and the Network custom resource, which let you create VMs on either the node network with a static IP address or the default pod network.
Preview: Enabled VM pods audit logs for VM runtime resources.
Preview: Expanded guest OS versions that can run on the virtual machine. We support Windows Server 2019, 2016, Windows 10, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, Centos 8, and Ubuntu 20.04 as guest OS.
Preview: Enabled virtual machine high availability to provide greater uptime for virtual machines instances (VMIs) by automatically detecting and recovering from a range of host machine failures.
1.10
Fixed
Fixed cluster lifecycle functionalities:
Outputs from all bmctl commands except bmctl version are now written to log files.
Fixed strict mode for decoding the cluster YAML file. Extraneous information in the cluster YAML file now results in an error.
Fixed preflight check so that it no longer ignores the no_proxy setting.
Binaries in cluster provision no longer run from /tmp , which is often mounted with noexec options. This change fixes a preflight check "permission denied" error.
Switched the default server-side containerRuntime value from docker to containerd .
Observability:
Increased the priority of the kube-state-metrics service to keep it from being stuck in a pending state. This service generates metrics about Kubernetes API objects such as deployments, nodes, and pods.
Upgraded metrics-server to version 0.3.6 to fix a missing metrics issue that occurs when a duplicated pod name is present.
1.10
Change
Functionality changes:
Enabled use of ADMIN_KUBECONFIG environment variable to reduce the number of bmctl command flags.
The cluster reconciliation process now checks for differences in the GKEHub membership before attempting to update it. If the GKEHub membership needs to be changed, the cluster is unregistered and then re-registered.
The advancedNetworking field in the cluster configuration file replaces the deprecated baremetal.cluster.gke.io/enable-anthos-network-gateway annotation for enabling advanced networking capabilities.
The NetworkGatewayGroup custom resource replaces the AnthosNetworkGateway custom resource.

For information about the latest known issues, see Anthos on bare metal known issues in the Troubleshooting section.
1.8
Fixed
Fixes:
Resolved, as part of the GA support for using containerd as the container runtime, incorrect cgroup driver use. Newly created 1.8.0 clusters that are configured to use containerd will use the correct systemd cgroup driver.
Fixed issue that prevented usage metrics for the containerd process from being collected by Cloud Logging. This fix applies to newly created 1.8.0 clusters only.
1.8
Change
Functionality changes:
Added --workspace-dir flag to bmctl to allow changing the path and name of the workspace directory from the default bmctl-workspace . The workspace directory contains the configuration and log files generated by bmctl . When using the bmctl command, pass in a --workspace-dir flag to specify a non-default workspace directory location. If the directory does not exist, bmctl will create it for you.
Moved away from iptables -based NodePort and masquerade handling to eBPF-based management. NodePort and masquerade handling are now applied to the Node IP and default gateway interfaces only.

Resolved the bmctl snapshot command failure when the user creates a custom cluster namespace omitting "cluster-" prefix from the cluster config file. The prefix is no longer required for a custom cluster namespace.
Added webhook blocks to prevent users from modifying control plane node pool and load balancer node pool resources directly. Control plane and load balancer node pools for Anthos clusters on bare metal are specified in the cluster resource, using the spec.controlPlane.nodePoolSpec and spec.LoadBalancer.nodePoolSpec sections of the cluster config file respectively.
Fixed the cluster upgrade command, bmctl upgrade cluster , to prevent it from interfering with user-installed Anthos Service Mesh (ASM).
1.7
Change
Functionality changes:
Updated the bmctl check snapshot command so that it includes certificate signing requests in the snapshot.
Changed the upgrade process to prevent node drain issues from blocking upgrades. The upgrade process triggers a node drain. Now, if the node drain takes longer than 20 minutes, the upgrade process carries on to completion even when the draining hasn't completed. In this case, the upgrade output reports the incomplete node drain. Excessive drain times signal a problematic with pods. You may need to restart problem pods.
Updated cluster creation process, bmctl create cluster , to display logged errors directly on the command line. Prior to this release, detailed error messages were only available in the log files.
1.7

1.6
Feature
Release 1.6.2
Anthos clusters on bare metal release 1.6.2 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading Anthos on bare metal . Anthos on bare metal 1.6.2 runs on Kubernetes 1.18.
1.6
Fixed
Fixes:
Updated custom resource API to reject changes to Cluster and NodePool configuration fields that are not currently supported. For a list of supported mutable fields, see Configuration in Known Issues.
Updated bmctl to allow creating or upgrading Anthos clusters on bare metal to the current bmctl version (1.6.2) only. For more information about version restrictions, see Installation in Known Issues.
Fixed an issue that caused the automatic reset of bare metal machines to fail after deleting the user cluster.
Added preflight check to verify that control group v2 , or cgroup v2 for short, is not in use on the cluster machine. Anthos on bare betal 1.6.x is incompatible with cgroup v2. For more information, see Control group v2 incompatibility in Known Issues.
Updated csi-snapshot-validation-webhook to support certification rotation. For more information about certificate rotation, see Security in Known Issues.
Fixed an issue to prevent constant patching for snapshot.storage.k8s.io CRDs.
Fixed a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) issue with kubelet to ensure fully qualified domain name(FQDN) hostnames are supported.

Feature
Release 1.6.1
Anthos clusters on bare metal release 1.6.1 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading Anthos on bare metal . Anthos on bare metal 1.6.1 runs on Kubernetes 1.18.6-gke.6600.
1.6
Change
Functionality changes:
Added upgrade support from 1.6.0. Users are able to upgrade existing Anthos bare metal cluster from 1.6.0 to 1.6.1.
Improved upgrade preflight check. Added preflight check before cluster upgrade to validate current cluster status, machine health and other issues before proceeding to upgrade.
Added support for deleting mounts and data from the anthos-system StorageClass during bmctl reset .
Relaxed the requirement for an odd number of control plane node pools to allow customers to add and remove nodes for maintenance or replacement.
Added support to force removing a broken worker node through annotation on the operator machine.
Added etcddefrag pod to control-plane nodes, which are responsible for monitoring etcd's database size and defragmenting the database as needed. This helps reclaim etcd database size and recover etcd when its disk space is exceeded.
Enabled kubelet server TLS certification auto-rotation. Kubelet on each node sends out CSR when nearing serving certificate expiration. A controller running inside the admin cluster validates and approves the CSR for user clusters.
Added proxy support to connect to the OIDC provider. This allows overriding the cluster proxy configuration with a different proxy.
Added bmctl update cluster for updating standalone clusters.
1.6
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed bug causing cluster deletion stall problem because of pods refusing to evacuate, or dead nodes.

Anthos on bare metal is generally available
Anthos on bare metal is a deployment option to run Anthos on physical or virtual servers, deployed on an operating system provided by you, without a hypervisor layer. Anthos on bare metal ships with built-in networking, lifecycle management, diagnostics, health checks, logging, and monitoring. Anthos on bare metal supports CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and Ubuntu—all validated by Google. With Anthos on bare metal, you can use your company's standard hardware and operating system images, taking advantage of existing investments, which are automatically checked and validated against Anthos infrastructure requirements.
Anthos on bare metal is available today, with either subscription or pay-as-you-go pricing . Anthos on bare metal lets you leverage existing investments in hardware, OS, and networking infrastructure. The minimum system requirement to run Anthos on bare metal is 2 nodes with a minimum total of 4 cores, 32 GB RAM, and 128 GB of disk space with no specialized hardware. The setup lets you run Anthos on bare metal on almost any infrastructure.
Anthos on bare metal uses a "bring your own operating system" model. It runs atop physical or virtual instances, and supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1/8.2, CentOS 8.1/8.2, or Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 LTS. Anthos provides overlay networking and L4/L7 load balancing. You can also integrate with your own load balancer such as F5 and Citrix. For storage, you can deploy persistent workloads using CSI integration with your existing infrastructure.
You can deploy Anthos on bare metal using one of the following deployment models:
A standalone model lets you manage every cluster independently. This is a good choice when running in an edge location or if you want your clusters to be administered independent of one another.
The multiple-cluster model lets central IT teams manage a fleet of clusters from a centralized cluster, called the admin cluster. This is more suitable if you want to build automation or tooling, or if you want to delegate the lifecycle of clusters to individual teams without sharing sensitive credentials such as SSH keys or Google Cloud service account details.
Like with all Anthos environments, a bare metal cluster has a thin, secure connection back to Google Cloud called Connect . After it's installed in your clusters, you can centrally view, configure, and monitor your clusters from the Google Cloud Console.
Anthos on bare metal, which is part of the Anthos 1.6 release, provides the following features and capabilities:
Kubernetes 1.18
Ubuntu/RHEL/CentOS support
Standalone and multiple-cluster architecture
In-place upgrades (minor and major)
