Create demo Google Distributed Cloud admin and user clusters on Compute Engine VMs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Learn about Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for bare metal by creating demo
clusters on Compute Engine Virtual Machines (VMs). In this tutorial, you run
a script that does the following:
Provisions five Compute Engine VMs for installing your demo clusters
Sets up a VPC network to provide cluster connectivity
After the script provisions the necessary resources, you use one of the
following clients to create an admin cluster and an accompanying user cluster
that can host workloads: bmctl , Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or
Terraform. Completing this tutorial can take 40 minutes to an hour.
Note: The demo clusters you create in this guide help you evaluate the process
for provisioning and operating Google Distributed Cloud clusters, but they aren't
intended for use in production. Note: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for bare metal was formerly known
as Google Distributed Cloud Virtual, which was previously known as
Anthos clusters on bare metal.
Procedure overview
In this tutorial, you'll complete the following steps:
Prepare your local environment so that the script has the required
environment variables and you've gathered the basic information needed to
run commands.
Create the VMs and network with the downloaded script.
Create the admin cluster with one of the supported clients.
Create the user cluster with one of the supported clients.
Clean up to remove the clusters and VMs you created with this guide.
1. Prepare your local environment
Because this guide uses a script that sets up the network for you, you don't
need to gather much information or do any planning. The following steps set up
your local environment and gather the basic information you need in subsequent
sections of the guide:
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector

Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Make a note of the project ID, because you need it to set an environment
variable that is used in the script and commands on this page. If you
selected an existing project, make sure that you are either a project owner
or editor.
You can run the script on Cloud Shell or your
local machine running Linux or macOS. If you're using a local machine, make
sure your environment has the required tools installed:
Make sure you have installed the latest
Google Cloud CLI , the command line tool for
interacting with Google Cloud. Update the gcloud CLI components,
if needed:
gcloud components update
Depending on how the gcloud CLI was installed, you might see
the following message:
You cannot perform this action because the Google Cloud CLI component manager is disabled for this installation. You can run the following command to achieve the same result for this installation:
Follow the instructions to copy and paste the command to update
the components.
Make sure you have kubectl installed:
kubectl
You should see usage information for kubectl . If the command is
not available, install kubectl :
gcloud components install kubectl
Make sure your project has a VPC network named "default".
If you don't have a "default" VPC network, the script in the
following section fails to provision the necessary resources. Unless you
choose to delete or restrict it, each new project starts with an auto mode
VPC network named "default" that should work with the script.
For more information, see VPC
networks .
Ensure the following organization policy constraints aren't enforced:
constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation
constraints/compute.vmCanIpForward
constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm
constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess
If these constraints are enforced, the script in the following section fails
to provision the necessary resources. For a new project, these constraints are
set to Inactive (unenforced) by default. For more information, see
Organization
policy constraints .
Setup environment variables:
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME = ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME
export ON_PREM_API_REGION = ON_PREM_API_REGION
export ZONE = ZONE
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : the name you choose for the
admin cluster.
ON_PREM_API_REGION : the Google Cloud region
in which the GKE On-Prem API runs and stores its metadata. Specify
us-central1 or another
supported region .
ZONE : the Google Cloud zone that the
Compute Engine VMs are created in. You can use
us-central1-a or any of the other
Compute Engine
zones .
Run the following commands to set the default project and zone.
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set compute/zone $ZONE
If you get a PERMISSION_DENIED error, double check the project ID that you
entered. If the project ID is correct, run gcloud auth login to sign in to
the gcloud CLI with the account that has access to the project.
Get a list of supported versions that you can install:
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters query-version-config \
--location = ON_PREM_API_REGION
Select a version from the output of the previous command and set it in an
environment variable:
export BMCTL_VERSION = BMCTL_VERSION
We recommend that you select the highest compatible version to get the
latest Google Distributed Cloud features and fixes.
2. Create the VMs and the network
In this section, you download and run the install_admin_cluster.sh script.
Clone the anthos-samples repository and change to the directory where the
script is located:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-samples
cd anthos-samples/anthos-bm-gcp-bash
Run the script:
bash install_admin_cluster.sh
At the prompt, enter 2 to set up the Compute Engine infrastructure only and
confirm your selection when prompted.
The script creates Compute Engine VMs, creates a VXLAN network, and sets up
the admin workstation and cluster nodes. This infrastructure takes about 5
minutes to set up.
To learn more about the script, click the following link:
About the script
You can view the script in the
anthos-bm-gcp-bash
folder in the
anthos-samples
GitHub repository. The script does the following:
Enables the following Google Cloud APIs:
anthos.googleapis.com
anthosaudit.googleapis.com
anthosgke.googleapis.com
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
connectgateway.googleapis.com
container.googleapis.com
compute.googleapis.com
gkeconnect.googleapis.com
gkehub.googleapis.com
gkeonprem.googleapis.com
serviceusage.googleapis.com
stackdriver.googleapis.com
monitoring.googleapis.com
logging.googleapis.com
kubernetesmetadata.googleapis.com
iam.googleapis.com
opsconfigmonitoring.googleapis.com
Instead of creating multiple service accounts for different APIs and
services, the script creates a single service account called
baremetal-gcr and grants it the following IAM roles:
roles/gkehub.admin
roles/gkehub.connect
roles/logging.logWriter
roles/monitoring.dashboardEditor
roles/monitoring.metricWriter
roles/monitoring.viewer
roles/opsconfigmonitoring.resourceMetadata.writer
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer
roles/stackdriver.resourceMetadata.writer
Creates the following VMs:
One VM for the admin workstation
One VM for the control plane node of the admin cluster
Two VMs for the worker nodes of the user cluster
One VM for the control plane node of the user cluster
Verifies that SSH is enabled on all VMs and that the admin workstation
has SSH access to all the other VMs that were created for cluster
nodes.
Creates a Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) overlay network for Layer 2
connectivity between the VMs. The VXLAN isn't persistent, so if you
reboot a VM instance the network is destroyed. The network is set up
to be on the 10.200.0.0/24 subnet. The Layer 2
connectivity is a requirement for the
bundled load balancer .
Installs the following tools on the admin workstation:
bmctl
kubectl
Docker
The script also downloads the service account key for the
baremetal-gcr service account to the admin workstation.
Ensures that root@10.200.0.x from the admin workstation
works by doing the following:
Generates a new SSH key on the admin workstation.
Adds the public key to all the other VMs in the deployment.
The script outputs each command it runs and the status. When it finishes,
the script outputs the following:
✅ Successfully set up SSH access from admin workstation to cluster node VMs.
✅ GCE Infrastructure setup complete. Please check the logs for any errors!!!
✅ If you do not see any errors in the output log, then you now have the following setup:
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VM Name | L2 Network IP (VxLAN) | INFO |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| abm-admin-cluster-cp | 10.200.0.3 | 🌟 Ready for use as control plane for the admin cluster |
| abm-user-cluster-cp | 10.200.0.4 | 🌟 Ready for use as control plane for the user cluster |
| abm-user-cluster-w1 | 10.200.0.5 | 🌟 Ready for use as worker for the user cluster |
| abm-user-cluster-w2 | 10.200.0.6 | 🌟 Ready for use as worker for the user cluster |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
3. Create the admin cluster
bmctl
To create an admin cluster with bmctl , you access the admin workstation VM in
a terminal window and run commands from there:
Use SSH to access the admin workstation VM, abm-ws , as root:
gcloud compute ssh root@abm-ws --zone ZONE
Set your user credentials as Application Default Credentials (ADC):
gcloud auth application-default login
Follow the prompts to select your Google Account for ADC.
Generate a cluster configuration file:
bmctl create config -c ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME --project-id = PROJECT_ID
Verify the admin cluster configuration file:
The following cluster configuration file is filled in with the values that
you provided earlier. In addition to the values you entered, note the
following differences from the generated configuration file:
Comments have been removed from this sample to improve readability.
The script creates a single service account with all required permissions
and downloads the bm-gcr.json key referenced in the configuration file.
gcrKeyPath : /root/bm-gcr.json
sshPrivateKeyPath : /root/.ssh/id_rsa
gkeConnectAgentServiceAccountKeyPath : /root/bm-gcr.json
gkeConnectRegisterServiceAccountKeyPath : /root/bm-gcr.json
cloudOperationsServiceAccountKeyPath : /root/bm-gcr.json

Replace the contents of the generated configuration file on your admin
workstation with the contents from the preceding sample.
Open the generated file,
bmctl-workspace/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME / ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME .yaml
and replace its contents with the contents of the sample you verified in the
preceding step.
Create the admin cluster:
bmctl create cluster -c ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME
The bmctl command displays output to the screen as it runs preflight
checks and creates the cluster. Verbose information is written to logs in
the baremetal/bmctl-workspace/abm-user-cluster-metallb/log
folder on the admin workstation.
Cluster creation can take several minutes to finish.
In the console, go to the GKE clusters page.
Go to GKE clusters
Make sure that the project in which you created the user cluster is selected.
You should see the admin cluster listed.
Sign in to the admin cluster:
Click the link on the cluster name, and on the side panel, click
Login .
Select Use your Google identity to log in .
Click Login .
Verify the admin cluster
You can find your admin cluster kubeconfig file on the admin workstation in the
bmctl-workspace directory of the root account. To verify your deployment,
complete the following steps:
Use SSH to access the admin workstation as root:
gcloud compute ssh root@abm-ws --zone ZONE
Verify that your admin cluster was created and is running:
kubectl --kubeconfig bmctl-workspace/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME / ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig get nodes
The output is similar to the following:
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
abm-admin-cluster-cp Ready control-plane 94m 1.31.300-gke.81
When you are finished exploring, enter exit to disconnect from the admin
workstation.
Console
To create an admin cluster in the console, you must run bmctl
register bootstrap from the admin workstation VM to create a bootstrap cluster.
While the bmctl register bootstrap command is running, you perform steps in
the console to create the admin cluster.
Enter bootstrap environment basics
In the Google Cloud console, go to the GKE clusters
page.
Go to GKE clusters
Click Create .
In the Create a cluster dialog, select On-premises and click
Configure for bare metal.
Make sure to select PROJECT_ID
from the project list.
In the left-navigation bar, click Install bootstrap environment .
Enter ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME as
the admin cluster name.
Select BMCTL_VERSION as the
version for your admin cluster. The script downloaded this version of the
bmctl command-line tool to the admin workstation. The Google Distributed Cloud
version that you install must match the bmctl version.
In the Google Cloud API Location field, select
ON_PREM_API_REGION from the
list. This setting specifies the region where the GKE On-Prem API runs, and
the region in which the following are stored:
The cluster metadata that the GKE On-Prem API needs
to manage the cluster lifecycle
The Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data of system components
The Admin Audit log created by Cloud Audit Logs
The cluster name, project, and location together uniquely identify the
cluster in Google Cloud.
Use the steps in the next section instead of the steps displayed in the
console to create the bootstrap cluster. Leave the
console page displayed because you continue there to
create the admin cluster.
Create the bootstrap cluster
When you use a GKE On-Prem API client, such as the console, to create an
admin cluster, you need to create a bootstrap cluster on the admin workstation.
The bootstrap cluster hosts the Kubernetes controllers needed to create the
admin cluster.
From the command line, use SSH to access the admin workstation VM as root:
gcloud compute ssh root@abm-ws --zone ZONE
You can ignore any messages about updating the VM and complete this
tutorial. If you plan to keep the VMs as a test environment, you might
want to update the OS or upgrade to the next release as described in the
Ubuntu documentation .
Set your user credentials as Application Default Credentials (ADC):
gcloud auth application-default login
Follow the prompts to select your Google Account for ADC.
Change to the baremetal/ directory and run the following command to create
the bootstrap cluster.
The bootstrap cluster name is derived by prepending bootstrap- to the
admin cluster name.
Note: There's no need to download bmctl , because the script you ran
earlier took care of that when it set up the admin workstation.
bmctl register bootstrap \
--ssh-key = /root/.ssh/id_rsa \
--name = bootstrap- ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project-id = PROJECT_ID
After bmctl successfully creates the bootstrap cluster, you see output
similar to the following:
[2023-03-22 17:35:24+0000] Waiting for the temporary cluster to be registered... OK
[2023-03-22 17:35:37+0000] Please go to https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=example-project-12345 to create the cluster
[2023-03-22 17:35:37+0000] Waiting for preflight checks and cluster to run..
Important: Leave the command running while you complete the steps in a new
terminal window. If you exit out of the bmctl register bootstrap
command before the admin cluster is created, the admin cluster creation
fails. After the admin cluster is successfully created, the command
automatically deletes the bootstrap cluster and exits.
Create the admin cluster
On the Install bootstrap environment page in the Bootstrap
environment from admin workstation section, click Check Connection .
On success, the console displays
check_circle Connection established .
The connection to the bootstrap cluster must be established before you
continue. If the connection isn't established, check the arguments that
you specified to the bmctl register bootstrap command:
Make sure that the value for --name matches the
Derived bootstrap name displayed in the
Bootstrap environment basics section.
Make sure the value for --project-id matches the ID of the project
that you selected in the console.
If you need to change the bootstrap cluster name or the project ID,
enter Ctrl-C to exit out of bmctl register bootstrap and
re-run the command.
Networking
Click Networking in the left-navigation bar.
In the Control plane section, enter the following in the Control
plane node IP 1 field:
10.200.0.3
This is the IP address of the abm-admin-cluster-cp VM in the VXLAN created
by the script.
In the Load balancer section, make sure that Bundled is selected.
In the Virtual IPs (VIPs) section, enter the following in the
Control plane VIP field:
10.200.0.48
The following step depends upon the availability of the bootstrap cluster.
The bmctl register bootstrap command in the terminal window must run for a
few minutes before the bootstrap cluster shows as a registered member. If,
after a few minutes, it's still not available, check the bootstrap cluster
name and project ID that you used. If you need to change the bootstrap
cluster name or the project ID, enter Ctrl-C in the other terminal window
to exit out of bmctl register bootstrap and re-run the command.
Click Verify and Create .
The console displays status messages as it verifies the settings and
creates the cluster.
When the admin cluster is created, the bootstrap cluster on the admin
workstation is deleted. The output of the bmctl register bootstrap
command in the other terminal window is similar to the following:
...

[2024-04-15 23:24:32+0000] Deleting bootstrap cluster.
Verify the admin cluster
You can find your admin cluster kubeconfig file on the admin workstation in the
bmctl-workspace directory of the root account. To verify your deployment,
complete the following steps:
Use SSH to access the admin workstation as root:
gcloud compute ssh root@abm-ws --zone ZONE
Verify that your admin cluster was created and is running:
kubectl --kubeconfig bmctl-workspace/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME / ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig get nodes
The output is similar to the following:
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
abm-admin-cluster-cp Ready control-plane 94m 1.31.300-gke.81
When you are finished exploring, enter exit to disconnect from the admin
workstation.
gcloud CLI
The following instructions require two terminal windows. In one terminal window,
you run bmctl register bootstrap to create a bootstrap cluster. While the
bmctl register bootstrap command is running, you run gcloud container
bare-metal admin-clusters create in another terminal window to create the admin
cluster.
Create the bootstrap cluster
When you use a GKE On-Prem API client, such as the gcloud CLI, to create an
admin cluster, you need to create a bootstrap cluster on the admin workstation.
The bootstrap cluster hosts the Kubernetes controllers needed to create the
admin cluster.
From the command line, use SSH to access the admin workstation VM as root:
gcloud compute ssh root@abm-ws --zone ZONE
You can ignore any messages about updating the VM and complete this
tutorial. If you plan to keep the VMs as a test environment, you might
want to update the OS or upgrade to the next release as described in the
Ubuntu documentation .
Set your user credentials as Application Default Credentials (ADC):
gcloud auth application-default login
Follow the prompts to select your Google Account for ADC.
Change to the baremetal/ directory and run the following command to create
the bootstrap cluster.
The bootstrap cluster name is derived by prepending bootstrap- to the
admin cluster name.
Note: There's no need to download bmctl , because the script you ran
earlier took care of that when it set up the admin workstation.
bmctl register bootstrap \
--ssh-key = /root/.ssh/id_rsa \
--name = bootstrap- ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project-id = PROJECT_ID
After bmctl successfully creates the bootstrap cluster, you see output
similar to the following:
[2023-03-22 17:35:24+0000] Waiting for the temporary cluster to be registered... OK
[2023-03-22 17:35:37+0000] Please go to https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=example-project-12345 to create the cluster
[2023-03-22 17:35:37+0000] Waiting for preflight checks and cluster to run..
Important: Leave the command running while you complete the steps in a new
terminal window. If you exit out of the bmctl register bootstrap
command before the admin cluster is created, the admin cluster creation
fails. After the admin cluster is successfully created, the command
automatically deletes the bootstrap cluster and exits.
Create the admin cluster
In a new terminal window, confirm that the bootstrap cluster has been
registered as a member of the fleet:
gcloud container fleet memberships list \
--project = PROJECT_ID
The gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters create command in the
following step depends upon the availability of the bootstrap cluster. The
bmctl register bootstrap command in the other terminal window must run for
a few minutes before the bootstrap cluster shows as a registered member. If,
after a few minutes, it's still not listed, check the bootstrap cluster name
and project ID that you used. If you need to change the bootstrap cluster
name or the project ID, enter Ctrl-C in the other terminal window to exit
out of bmctl register bootstrap and re-run the command.
Create the admin cluster with the bundled load balancer:
Ensure that the values you specify match the environment variables that you
specified earlier for the script.
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters create ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = ON_PREM_API_REGION \
--version = BMCTL_VERSION \
--max-pods-per-node = 110 \
--control-plane-vip = 10 .200.0.48 \
--control-plane-load-balancer-port = 443 \
--control-plane-node-configs node-ip = 10 .200.0.3 \
--island-mode-service-address-cidr-blocks = 10 .96.0.0/20 \
--island-mode-pod-address-cidr-blocks = 192 .168.0.0/16 \
--lvp-share-path = /mnt/localpv-share \
--lvp-share-storage-class = local-shared \
--lvp-node-mounts-config-path = /mnt/localpv-disk \
--lvp-node-mounts-config-storage-class = local-disks
In this command:
--control-plane-vip : Is set to 10.200.0.48 . This is the virtual IP
(VIP) on the load balancer for the cluster's Kubernetes API server.
--control-plane-node-configs : The node-ip is set to 10.200.0.3 .
This is the IP address of the abm-admin-cluster-cp VM in the VXLAN
created by the script.
For a complete list of the flags and their descriptions, see the
gcloud CLI reference .
The output from the command is similar to the following:
Waiting for operation [projects/example-project-12345/locations/us-west1/operations/operation-1679543737105-5f7893fd5bae9-942b3f97-75e59179] to complete.
In the example output, the string operation-1679543737105-5f7893fd5bae9-942b3f97-75e59179
is the OPERATION_ID of the long-running operation.
You can find out the status of the operation by running the following
command in another terminal window:
gcloud container bare-metal operations describe OPERATION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = ON_PREM_API_REGION
When the gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters create command
completes successfully, the output is similar to the following:

Verify the admin cluster
You can find your admin cluster kubeconfig file on the admin workstation in the
bmctl-workspace directory of the root account. To verify your deployment,
complete the following steps:
Use SSH to access the admin workstation as root:
gcloud compute ssh root@abm-ws --zone ZONE
Verify that your admin cluster was created and is running:
kubectl --kubeconfig bmctl-workspace/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME / ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig get nodes
The output is similar to the following:
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
abm-admin-cluster-cp Ready control-plane 94m 1.31.300-gke.81
When you are finished exploring, enter exit to disconnect from the admin
workstation.
Terraform
The following instructions require two terminal windows. In one terminal window,
you run bmctl register bootstrap to create a bootstrap cluster. While the
bmctl register bootstrap command is running, you run the Terraform commands in
another terminal window to create the admin cluster.
Modify user cluster sample files to work for an admin cluster
The anthos-samples repository doesn't include a sample that is specifically
for creating a Google Distributed Cloud admin cluster. The following steps show you
how to create an admin cluster by modifying an existing user cluster Terraform
sample.
In the directory where you cloned anthos-samples , run the following
command to copy the sample files for the MetalLB user cluster sample into a
new folder for your admin cluster:
cp -r anthos-samples/anthos-onprem-terraform/abm_user_cluster_metallb \
anthos-samples/anthos-onprem-terraform/abm_admin_cluster_basic
Change to the abm_admin_cluster_basic directory:
cd anthos-samples/anthos-onprem-terraform/abm_admin_cluster_basic
Edit the Terraform files:
variables.tf :
Define a variable for the control plane node IP addresses (though we
use just one for this demo). This variable should be similar to the
variable "control_plane_ips" { ... } entry.
Define a variable for the control plane VIP address. This variable
should be similar to the variable "control_plane_vip" { ... }
entry.
terraform.tfvars :
Assign variable values for the following admin cluster settings:
Control plane node IP addresses: 10.200.0.3
Control plane VIP address: 10.200.0.48
main.tf :
Replace the google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_cluster resource with the
google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_admin_cluster resource.
Delete the google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_node_pool resource and related
lifecycle section.
Update the resource to use the newly defined variables.
Here's an example of how the main.tf file might look when it's edited to
create an admin cluster:

google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_admin_cluster
in the Terraform registry.
Create the bootstrap cluster
When you use a GKE On-Prem API client, such as Terraform, to create an
admin cluster, you need to create a bootstrap cluster on the admin workstation.
The bootstrap cluster hosts the Kubernetes controllers needed to create the
admin cluster.
From the command line, use SSH to access the admin workstation VM as root:
gcloud compute ssh root@abm-ws --zone ZONE
You can ignore any messages about updating the VM and complete this
tutorial. If you plan to keep the VMs as a test environment, you might
want to update the OS or upgrade to the next release as described in the
Ubuntu documentation .
Set your user credentials as Application Default Credentials (ADC):
gcloud auth application-default login
Follow the prompts to select your Google Account for ADC.
Change to the baremetal/ directory and run the following command to create
the bootstrap cluster.
The bootstrap cluster name is derived by prepending bootstrap- to the
admin cluster name.
Note: There's no need to download bmctl , because the script you ran
earlier took care of that when it set up the admin workstation.
bmctl register bootstrap \
--ssh-key = /root/.ssh/id_rsa \
--name = bootstrap- ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project-id = PROJECT_ID
After bmctl successfully creates the bootstrap cluster, you see output
similar to the following:
[2023-03-22 17:35:24+0000] Waiting for the temporary cluster to be registered... OK
[2023-03-22 17:35:37+0000] Please go to https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=example-project-12345 to create the cluster
[2023-03-22 17:35:37+0000] Waiting for preflight checks and cluster to run..
Important: Leave the command running while you complete the steps in a new
terminal window. If you exit out of the bmctl register bootstrap
command before the admin cluster is created, the admin cluster creation
fails. After the admin cluster is successfully created, the command
automatically deletes the bootstrap cluster and exits.
Create the admin cluster
Initialize and create the Terraform plan:
terraform init
Terraform installs any needed libraries, such as the Google Cloud provider.
Review the configuration and make changes if needed:
terraform plan
Apply the Terraform plan to create the admin cluster:
terraform apply
It takes 15 minutes or more to create the admin cluster. When the cluster
creation completes, you see a message like the following:
...
google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_admin_cluster.admin-cluster-basic: Still creating... [20m10s elapsed]
google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_admin_cluster.admin-cluster-basic: Creation complete after 20m11s
[id=projects/anonuser-anonproject/locations/us-central1/bareMetalAdminClusters/gce-admin-terra002]
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
When the admin cluster is created, the bootstrap cluster on the admin
workstation is deleted. The output of the bmctl register bootstrap
command in the other terminal window is similar to the following:
...

When you are finished exploring, enter exit to disconnect from the admin
workstation.
4. Create the user cluster
You can use the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, or Terraform to create
the user cluster. For simplicity, use abm-user-cluster-metallb for the user
cluster name, to match the hard-coded name in the Terraform scripts.
bmctl
Use SSH to access the admin workstation VM, abm-ws , as root:
gcloud compute ssh root@abm-ws --zone ZONE
Generate a cluster configuration file:
bmctl create config -c abm-user-cluster-metallb \
--project-id = PROJECT_ID
In the following user cluster configuration file, set your email address in
the clusterSecurity section and verify the rest of the settings:
The following cluster configuration file is filled in with the values that
you entered in the planning table earlier. In addition to the values you
entered, note the following differences from the generated configuration
file:
Comments have been removed from this sample to improve readability.
The credentials section has been removed as is normal for user clusters.
The cluster type, spec.type , has been set to user .
The spec.clusterSecurity.authorization.clusterAdmin.gcpAccounts field
was added to grant the clusterrole/cluster-admin role to your account.
Among other things, this field lets you sign in to your cluster in the
Google Cloud console to see more cluster details.

--lvp-share-storage-class = local-shared \
--lvp-node-mounts-config-path = /mnt/localpv-disk \
--lvp-node-mounts-config-storage-class = local-disks
After running the command, you see output like the following:
Waiting for operation [projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ON_PREM_API_REGION /operations/operation-1678304606537-5f668bde5c57e-341effde-b612ff8a] to complete...
In the example output, the string operation-1678304606537-5f668bde5c57e-341effde-b612ff8a
is the OPERATION_ID of the long-running operation.
To find out the status of the operation, open another terminal window and
run the command.
gcloud container bare-metal operations describe OPERATION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = ON_PREM_API_REGION
Replace OPERATION_ID with the corresponding string
from the output of the preceding step.
It takes about 15 minutes or more to create the cluster. As the cluster
is being created, you can run the previous command every so often to
get the current status.
When the cluster is created, you see output like the following:
Created Anthos cluster on bare metal [ https://gkeonprem.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ON_PREM_API_REGION /bareMetalClusters/abm-user-cluster-metallb ] .
For more information about the gcloud container bare-metal clusters create
command, including descriptions of each flag, see the
container bare-metal clusters create
page for the clusters resource in the gcloud CLI reference.
Create a node pool
After the cluster is successfully created, you can create a node pool for the
cluster.
To create a node pool:
Run the following command to create a node pool:
gcloud container bare-metal node-pools create NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster = abm-user-cluster-metallb \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = ON_PREM_API_REGION \
--node-configs = 'node-ip=10.200.0.5'
Replace NODE_POOL_NAME with a name for the node pool.
After running the command, you should see output like the following:
Waiting for operation [projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ON_PREM_API_REGION /operations/operation-1678308682052-5f669b0d132cb-6ebd1c2c-816287a7] to complete...
It takes about 5 minutes or less to create the node pool. When the node pool
is created, you see output like the following:
Created node pool in Anthos cluster on bare metal [https://gkeonprem.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ON_PREM_API_REGION /bareMetalClusters/abm-user-cluster-metallb/bareMetalNodePools/ NODE_POOL_NAME ].
Go to the Kubernetes clusters page in the console:
Go to the Create a bare metal cluster page
Make sure that the project in which you created the user cluster is selected.
You should see both the admin and user cluster on the list.
Sign in to the user cluster:
Click the link on the cluster name, and on the side panel, click
Login .
Select Use your Google identity to log in .
Click Login .
Repeat the same steps to sign in to the admin cluster.
Terraform
You can use the following basic configuration sample to create a user cluster
with a bundled MetalLB load balancer. For more information, see the
google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_cluster reference documentation .
In the directory where you cloned anthos-samples , change to the directory
where the Terraform sample is located:
cd anthos-samples/anthos-onprem-terraform/abm_user_cluster_metallb
The sample provides an example variables file to pass in to main.tf .
Make a copy of the terraform.tfvars.sample file:
cp terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
Verify the values in the following sample.
The following Terraform variables file, terraform.tfvars.sample , is
prefilled with IP addresses and with values that you entered in preceding
sections of this guide.
project_id = " PROJECT_ID "
region = " ON_PREM_API_REGION "
admin_cluster_name = " ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME "
bare_metal_version = "VERSION"
admin_user_emails = [ " YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS ", " ADMIN_2_EMAIL_ADDRESS " ]
cluster_name = "abm-user-cluster-metallb"
control_plane_ips = [ "10.200.0.4" ]
worker_node_ips = [ "10.200.0.5", "10.200.0.6" ]
control_plane_vip = "10.200.0.50"
ingress_vip = "10.200.0.51"
lb_address_pools = [
{ name = "lbpool_1", addresses = ["10.200.0.51-10.200.0.70" ] }
]
Replace ADMIN_2_EMAIL_ADDRESS with an email
address that is associated with your Google Cloud account, or remove it when
you edit the variables file.
For more information about the arguments in this sample for which you're
setting variables, see
Argument Reference
in the Terraform documentation for bare metal user clusters.
Replace the contents of your copy of the variables file with the contents
from the preceding sample.
Initialize and create the Terraform plan:
terraform init
Terraform installs any needed libraries, such as the Google Cloud provider.
Review the configuration and make changes if needed:
terraform plan
Apply the Terraform plan to create the user cluster:
terraform apply
It takes 15 minutes or more to create the user cluster. You can view
the cluster in the Google Cloud console on the
GKE clusters
page.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the GKE clusters
page.
Go to GKE clusters
Make sure that the project in which you created the user cluster is selected.
You should see both the admin and user cluster on the list.
Sign in to the user cluster:
Click the link on the cluster name, and on the side panel, click
Login .
Select Use your Google identity to log in .
Click Login .
Repeat the same steps to sign in to the admin cluster.
5. Clean up
Use the following instructions to remove the clusters and VMs you created with
this guide.
Delete the user cluster
bmctl
To delete the user cluster with bmctl , run the following command from the
admin workstation VM, abm-ws :
bmctl reset \
--cluster abm-user-cluster-metallb \
--admin-kubeconfig bmctl-workspace/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME / ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig
Console
In the console, go to the GKE clusters
page.
Go to GKE clusters
In the list of clusters, click the user cluster.
In the Details panel, click View more details .
Near the top of the window, click delete
Delete .
When prompted to confirm, enter the cluster name and click Delete .
Click notifications in the
top-right corner to view the status of the deletion. You might have to
refresh the page to update the clusters list.
gcloud CLI
Delete the cluster:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters delete abm-user-cluster-metallb \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = ON_PREM_API_REGION \
--force
The --force flag lets you delete a cluster that has node pools.
Without the --force flag, you have to
delete the node pools
first, and then delete the cluster.
For information about other flags, see
gcloud container bare-metal clusters delete .
Terraform
The terraform destroy command terminates resources that were create when you
ran terraform apply to create the user cluster.
Run the following command from the directory where the Terraform user
cluster sample files, such as main.tf are located:
terraform destroy
Wait for the user cluster to be deleted before deleting the admin cluster
and VMs.
Delete the admin cluster and VMs
Unenroll the admin cluster from the GKE On-Prem API:
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters unenroll ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = ON_PREM_API_REGION
Connect to the admin workstation:
gcloud compute ssh root@abm-ws --zone ZONE
Delete the admin cluster:
bmctl reset -c ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME
bmctl unregisters the cluster from the fleet and then deletes the
cluster. Wait for the cluster to be deleted before deleting the VMs.
Exit the admin workstation:
exit
List all VMs that have abm in their name:
gcloud compute instances list | grep 'abm'
Verify that you're fine with deleting all VMs that contain abm in the
name.
After you've verified, you can delete abm VMs by running the following
command:
gcloud compute instances list --format = "value(name)" | \
grep 'abm' | \
xargs gcloud compute instances delete --quiet --zone ZONE
Run the following command to delete the service account and, when prompted,
enter y :
gcloud iam service-accounts delete baremetal-gcr@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
