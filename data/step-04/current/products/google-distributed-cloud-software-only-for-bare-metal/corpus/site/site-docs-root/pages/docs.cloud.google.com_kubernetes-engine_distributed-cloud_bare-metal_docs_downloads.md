Download bmctl
bmctl is the command-line tool for Google Distributed Cloud that simplifies
cluster creation and management. For more information about what you can do with
bmctl , see bmctl tool .
From your Linux admin workstation, use the following commands to download
bmctl and make it executable:
gcloud storage cp gs://anthos-baremetal-release/bmctl/ VERSION /linux-amd64/bmctl .
chmod +x ./bmctl
Replace VERSION with the version of
Google Distributed Cloud you want to install or upgrade your clusters to. Here's the
list of the latest patch versions for supported minor versions:
1.34.200-gke.68
1.33.600-gke.39
1.32.1000-gke.57
For a list of all available versions, see Version
history .
Verify bmctl using openssl
Verify the bmctl binary against the public key using openssl , where
VERSION is the file's version:
If you haven't already, write the pubic key to a file, public.key :
cat << EOF > public.key
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEWZrGCUaJJr1H8a36sG4UUoXvlXvZ
wQfk16sxprI2gOJ2vFFggdq3ixF2h4qNBt0kI7ciDhgpwS8t+/960IsIgw ==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
EOF
Download the digital signature file for the specific version of bmctl that
you downloaded:
gcloud storage cp gs://anthos-baremetal-release/bmctl/ VERSION /linux-amd64/bmctl.1.sig .
Use OpenSSL to verify the signature:
openssl dgst -verify public.key -signature ./bmctl.1.sig ./bmctl
Expected output of this command is Verified OK .
Download the images package
You only need the images package if you plan on setting up a
registry mirror . The package provides
all of the container images used by Google Distributed Cloud for the specified
version. Make sure the package you download is the same version as the bmctl
download.
From your Linux admin workstation, run the following command to download the package:
gcloud storage cp gs://anthos-baremetal-release/bmctl/ VERSION /linux-amd64/bmpackages_ VERSION .tar.xz .
Verify the images package using openssl
Verify the images package binary against the public key using openssl , where
VERSION is the file's version:
If you haven't already, write the pubic key to a file, public.key :
cat << EOF > public.key
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEWZrGCUaJJr1H8a36sG4UUoXvlXvZ
wQfk16sxprI2gOJ2vFFggdq3ixF2h4qNBt0kI7ciDhgpwS8t+/960IsIgw ==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
EOF
Download the digital signature file for the specific version of bmctl that
you downloaded:
gcloud storage cp gs://anthos-baremetal-release/bmctl/ VERSION /linux-amd64/bmpackages_ VERSION .tar.xz.1.sig .
Use OpenSSL to verify the signature:
openssl dgst -verify public.key -signature \
./bmpackages_ VERSION .tar.xz.1.sig \
./bmpackages_ VERSION .tar.xz
Expected output of this command is Verified OK .
