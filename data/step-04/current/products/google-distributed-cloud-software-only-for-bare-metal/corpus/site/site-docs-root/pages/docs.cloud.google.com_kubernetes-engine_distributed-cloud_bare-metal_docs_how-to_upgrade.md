Upgrade clusters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
When you install a new version of bmctl , you can upgrade your existing
clusters that were created with an earlier version. Upgrading a cluster to the
latest Google Distributed Cloud version brings added features and fixes to your
cluster. It also ensures that your cluster remains
supported .
You can upgrade admin, hybrid, standalone, or user clusters with the
bmctl upgrade cluster command, or you can use kubectl .
To learn more about the upgrade process and versioning rules, see
Lifecycle and stages of cluster upgrades .
This page is for Admins and architects and Operators who manage the
lifecycle of the underlying tech infrastructure. To learn more about common
roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Note: When upgrading Google Distributed Cloud from a version with a security patch
to the next minor release, we recommend you upgrade to the highest patch version
available to ensure you have the latest security patches. Always review the
release notes before upgrading so you are aware of what has changed, including
security fixes and known issues. Downgrading to a lower cluster version isn't
supported.
Plan your upgrade
This section contains information and links to information that you should
consider before you upgrade a cluster. For more information about upgrades,
including versioning rules for clusters and node pools, see
Lifecycle and stages of cluster upgrades .
Best practices
For information to help you prepare for a cluster upgrade, see
Best practices for Google Distributed Cloud cluster upgrades .
Upgrade preflight checks
Preflight checks are run as part of the cluster upgrade to validate cluster
status and node health. The cluster upgrade doesn't proceed if the preflight
checks fail. For more information on preflight checks, see
Understand preflight checks .
You can check if the clusters are ready for an upgrade by running the preflight
check before running the upgrade. For more information, see
Preflight checks for upgrades .
Known issues
For information about potential problems related to cluster upgrades, see
Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal known issues
and select the Upgrades and updates problem category.
Configure upgrade options
Before you start a cluster upgrade, you can configure the following upgrade
options that control how the upgrade process works:
Selective worker node pool upgrades : upgrade specific
worker node pools separately from the rest of the cluster.
Parallel upgrades : configure the upgrade process to
upgrade groups of nodes or node pools simultaneously.
These options can reduce the risk of disruptions to critical applications and
services and significantly reduce overall upgrade time. These options are
especially useful for large clusters with numerous nodes and node pools running
important workloads. For more information about what these options do and how to
use them, see the following sections.
Skip upgrades
Starting with version 1.33, Google Distributed Cloud supports skip upgrades for
all cluster types, letting you upgrade a cluster to a target version (1.33 or
higher) that is two minor versions ahead of its current version in a single
operation. For example, you can upgrade from version 1. N . X directly to version 1. N+2 . Z with a single operation.
The following list shows the launch stage for this feature per version, where
the version is the upgrade target version:
1.34 and higher: GA
1.33: Preview
1.32 and lower: Not available
Skip upgrades help you access the latest features and fixes more quickly than
with incremental upgrades. Skip upgrades can also extend the time between
required upgrade operations, reducing potential disruptions. You can use skip
upgrades together with other upgrade options, such as selective worker node
pool upgrades and parallel upgrades .
During a skip upgrade, the system upgrades the cluster to an intermediate minor
version and then immediately upgrades it to the target version. This
intermediate version has implications if you use a registry mirror. For more
information, see Additional requirement for registry mirrors .
Skip upgrades for clusters is in
Preview for version
1.33. We recommend that don't perform skip upgrades from 1.31 to 1.33 with
production clusters.
Skip upgrade prerequisites
The process for performing a skip upgrade isn't different from performing a
sequential upgrade, but there are some additional prerequisites:
Verify that the cluster is in a state where a skip upgrade doesn't violate
cluster and node pool version
rules :
Before you start a skip upgrade for an admin or hybrid cluster, ensure
that all of its managed user clusters are at the same minor version as
the managing cluster.
Before you start a skip upgrade for a user cluster, ensure that your
clusters meet the following criteria:
The associated managing admin or hybrid cluster is two minor
versions higher than the user cluster.
All worker node pools for the user cluster are at the same minor
version as the user cluster.
Add the
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/skip-minor-version-cluster-upgrade
annotation to the cluster configuration file:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : baremetal-demo
namespace : cluster-baremetal-demo
annotations :
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/skip-minor-version-cluster-upgrade : "enable"
spec :
type : user
profile : default
anthosBareMetalVersion : 1.34.200-gke.68
...
Update anthosBareMetalVersion in the cluster configuration file to the
upgrade target version of the skip upgrade.
As with sequential upgrades, you can start the skip upgrade
with either bmctl upgrade cluster or kubectl apply .
Additional requirement for registry mirrors
If you pull container images from a registry
mirror to upgrade your cluster, your
registry mirror must have the images for both the target version and the
intermediate version of the skip upgrade.
To prepare your registry mirror for a skip upgrade, follow these steps:
Using the version of bmctl that corresponds to the target version of the
skip upgrade, find out what's the intermediate version for the skip upgrade:
bmctl upgrade intermediate-version
The command response consists of the specific Google Distributed Cloud patch
version that the system uses as the intermediate version during the skip
upgrade. For example, for bmctl version 1.33.0-gke.799, the response looks
like the following:
1.32.200-gke.104
Download the images packages for both the target version and the
intermediate version.
For more information, see Download the images
package .
Push the images packages for both the target version and the intermediate
version to the registry mirror before starting the skip upgrade.
Hosting container images for both the target and intermediate versions
requires additional disk
space for your
registry mirror.
As with sequential upgrades, you can start the skip upgrade
with either bmctl upgrade cluster or kubectl apply .
Selective worker node pool upgrades
By default, the cluster upgrade operation upgrades every node and node pool in
the cluster. A cluster upgrade can be disruptive and time consuming, as it
results in each node being drained and all associated pods being
restarted and rescheduled. This section describes how you can include or exclude
select worker node pools for a cluster upgrade to minimize workload disruption.
This feature applies to user, hybrid, and standalone clusters only, since admin
clusters don't allow worker node pools.
You might use selective node pool upgrades in the following situations:
To pick up security fixes without disrupting workloads: You can upgrade
just your control plane nodes (and load balancer nodes) to apply Kubernetes
vulnerability fixes without disrupting your worker node pools.
To confirm proper operation of an upgraded subset of worker nodes before
upgrading all worker nodes: You can upgrade your worker node pools
selectively to ensure that workloads are running properly on an upgraded
node pool before you upgrade another node pool.
To reduce the maintenance window: Upgrading a large cluster can be time
consuming and it's difficult to accurately predict when an upgrade will
complete. Cluster upgrade time is proportional to the number of nodes being
upgraded. Reducing the number of nodes being upgraded by excluding node
pools reduces the upgrade time. You upgrade multiple times, but the smaller,
more predictable maintenance windows may help with scheduling.
Two minor version node pool version skew
For version 1.28 and higher clusters, a worker node pool version can be up to
two minor versions behind the cluster (control plane) version. With n-2
version skew support, you can also skip a minor release version when you
upgrade a worker node pool from two minor versions behind the cluster to the
same minor version as the cluster.
This n-2 version skew support for worker node pools gives you more flexibility
to plan your fleet upgrades.
For example, if you have a version 1.34 cluster, you can have
worker node pools at select 1.34, 1.33, and
1.32 versions.
Before you can upgrade a cluster, all of the worker node pools must be at a
version that is compatible with both the current cluster version and the target
cluster version.
For example, if you have a cluster at version 1.29 and worker node pools at
version 1.29, version 1.28, and version 1.16, you must upgrade the version 1.16
node pools to version 1.28 or 1.29 before you can upgrade the cluster to version
1.30.
For more information, including lists of supported worker node pool versions
supported by a given cluster version (applicable for version 1.29 and earlier), see Node pool versioning rules
1.30 and higher
In release 1.30, n-2 version skew support for worker node pools is GA
for all cluster types. This feature is enabled by default for clusters at
version 1.30.
Node pools at any patch version of the 1.28 and 1.29 minor versions can be
upgraded to any patch version of 1.30, if the node pool version is the same
or lower than the cluster version.
1.29
In release 1.29, n-2 version skew support for worker node pools is GA
for all cluster types. This feature is enabled by default for clusters at
version 1.29.
As we transition this feature from Public Preview to GA, hybrid clusters
still require the preview annotation in the following situation. If you have
a version 1.28.x hybrid cluster with a version 1.16.y worker node pool, you
must add the preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/two-minor-version-node-pool: enable
annotation to the cluster before you upgrade it to version 1.29.z:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : baremetal-demo
namespace : cluster-baremetal-demo
annotations :
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/two-minor-version-node-pool : enable
spec :

anthosBareMetalVersion : 1.28.400-gke.77
...
1.28

This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific

launch stage descriptions .
The n-2 version skew support for worker node pools is available for
Preview in release 1.28. To enable this
Preview capability, add the
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/two-minor-version-node-pool: enable
annotation to your cluster configuration file:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1

If you don't enable this Preview capability, the maximum version skew
between a worker node pool and the cluster is one minor version.
For more information about the versioning rules for selectively upgrading worker
node pools, see Node pool versioning
rules in Lifecycle and
stages of cluster upgrades.
Upgrade your cluster control plane and selected node pools
To selectively upgrade worker node pools in the initial cluster upgrade:
For the worker node pools that you want to include in the cluster
upgrade, make one of the following changes to the NodePool spec:
Set anthosBareMetalVersion in the NodePool spec to the cluster target
upgrade version.
Omit the anthosBareMetalVersion field from the NodePool spec. or set
it to the empty string. By default, worker node pools are included in
cluster upgrades.
For the worker node pools that you want to exclude from the upgrade, set
anthosBareMetalVersion to the current (pre-upgrade) version of the
cluster:
Continue with your upgrade as described in
Start the cluster upgrade .
The cluster upgrade operation upgrades the following nodes:
Cluster control plane nodes.
Load balancer node pool, if your cluster uses one
( spec.loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec ). By default, load balancer nodes can
run regular workloads. You can't selectively upgrade a load balancer node
pool, it's always included in the initial cluster upgrade.
Worker node pools that you haven't excluded from the upgrade.
For example, suppose that your cluster is at version 1.33.0 and
has two worker node pools: wpool01 and wpool02 . Also, suppose that you want
to upgrade the control plane and wpool01 to 1.34.200-gke.68, but you want
wpool02 to remain at version 1.33.0.
The following cluster configuration file excerpt shows how you can modify the
cluster configuration to support this partial upgrade:

Upgrade node pools to the current cluster version
If you've excluded node pools from a cluster upgrade, you can run a cluster
upgrade that brings them up to the target cluster version. Worker node pools
that have been excluded from a cluster upgrade have the anthosBareMetalVersion
field in their NodePool spec set to the previous (pre-upgrade) cluster version.
To bring worker node pools up to the current, upgraded cluster version:
Edit the NodePool specs in the cluster configuration file for the worker
node pools that you want to bring up to the current cluster version. Set
anthosBareMetalVersion to the current (post-upgrade) cluster version.
If multiple worker node pools are selected for upgrade, the value
of spec.nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.concurrentNodePools in the
cluster spec determines how many node pools are upgraded in parallel, if
any. If you don't want to upgrade worker node pools concurrently, select one
node pool at a time for upgrade.
Continue with your upgrade as described in
Start the cluster upgrade .
The cluster upgrade operation upgrades only the previously excluded worker
node pools for which you have set anthosBareMetalVersion to the current,
upgraded cluster version.
For example, suppose that you upgraded your cluster to version
1.34.200-gke.68, but node pool wpool02 is still at the old, pre-upgrade
cluster version 1.33.0. Workloads are running properly on the
upgraded node pool, wpool01 , so now you want to bring wpool02 up to the
current cluster version, too. To upgrade wpool02 , you can remove the
anthosBareMetalVersion field or set its value to the empty string.

Roll back a node pool upgrade
There are many dependencies, such as compatibility with kubelet or plugins, that
can affect the performance of your workloads. In the event that you encounter a
problem after upgrading a worker node pool, you can roll back the node pool to
its previous version.
This feature isn't at the same launch phase for all supported cluster versions:
1.30 and higher
For version 1.30 clusters (clusters with control plane nodes at version
1.30), the node pool rollback capability is GA and enabled by default.
1.29
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
The node pool rollback capability is available for
Preview for version 1.29 clusters
(clusters with control plane nodes at version 1.29). While this feature is
in Preview, you must add the following annotation to the Cluster resource
to enable the feature:
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/worker-node-pool-upgrade-rollback : enable
1.28
The node pool rollback capability isn't available for clusters at minor
version 1.28 or earlier.
To roll back a node pool upgrade, use the following steps:
bmctl
When you use bmctl to roll back a node pool upgrade, you edit the cluster
configuration file and apply your changes with the bmctl update command:
Edit the NodePool specs in the cluster configuration file for the
worker node pools that you want to roll back to the previous version.
Set anthosBareMetalVersion to the previous (pre-upgrade) cluster
version.

- address : 10.200.0.1
- address : 10.200.0.2
- address : 10.200.0.3
...
If multiple worker node pools are selected for rollback, the value of
spec.nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.concurrentNodePools in
the cluster spec determines how many node pools are rolled back in
parallel. If you don't want to roll back worker node pools concurrently,
select one node pool at a time for rollback or update the
nodePoolUpgradeStrategy settings. Likewise, the value of
spec.upgradeStrategy.parallelUpgrade.concurrentNodes in the NodePool
spec determines how many nodes are rolled back in parallel.
Use bmctl update to apply your NodePool spec changes:
bmctl update cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME --kubeconfig = ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster you want
to update.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path of the kubeconfig
file of the managing cluster (admin, hybrid, or standalone).
The rollback starts automatically. The bmctl update cluster command
exits immediately, but the rollback continues to progress. Don't perform
any other operations on the cluster while the rollback is in progress.
As the rollback runs, Google Distributed Cloud performs the following
activities for each node:
Put the node into maintenance mode.
Run a reset job on the node to bring it to a clean state.
Run machine preflight
checks on the
node.
Run a machine-init job on the node to reinstall it at the target
rollback (pre-upgrade) version.
Remove the node from maintenance mode.
At the end of a successful rollback, the value of
nodePool.status.anthosBareMetalVersion in the NodePool resource is set
to the target rollback version.
Don't use bmctl update and kubectl apply -f
interchangeably when editing the cluster configuration file. When these
commands are used interchangeably, contents populated by the header of the
cluster spec might be unintentionally removed. For example, you might use
bmctl update to update the cluster configuration file to
configure a registry mirror .
The cluster then has spec.nodeConfig.registryMirrors populated
after reconciliation.
If you then attempt to make changes to the cluster using the cluster
configuration with the kubectl apply -f command, the
spec.nodeConfig.registryMirrors populated by the reconciler
on the cluster is removed. This behavior happens because the configuration
doesn't exist in the cluster configuration spec, but it does in the cluster.
kubectl
You can roll back a node pool upgrade by using kubectl to edit the
NodePool resource directly:
To roll back a worker node pool, open the NodePool resource for
editing:
kubectl edit nodepool NODE_POOL_NAME \
--namespace CLUSTER_NAMESPACE \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : the name of the node pool
you're rolling back.
CLUSTER_NAMESPACE : the name of the namespace in
which the node pool is deployed. This is the cluster namespace.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path of the kubeconfig
file of the managing cluster (admin, hybrid, or standalone).
Change the value of spec.anthosBareMetalVersion to the previous
(pre-upgrade) version.

Save and close the NodePool resource in your editor.
The rollback starts automatically. Don't perform any other operations on
the cluster while the rollback is in progress.
As the rollback runs, Google Distributed Cloud performs the following

Run machine preflight
checks on the
node.

Remove the node from maintenance mode.
At the end of a successful rollback, the value of
nodePool.status.anthosBareMetalVersion in the NodePool resource is set
to the target rollback version.
Parallel upgrades
In a typical, default cluster upgrade, each cluster node is upgraded
sequentially, one after the other. This section shows you how to configure your
cluster and worker node pools so that multiple nodes upgrade in parallel when you
upgrade your cluster. Upgrading nodes in parallel speeds up cluster upgrades
significantly, especially for clusters that have hundreds of nodes.
Caution: If you use managed data services, such a Portworx, to help manage
stateful workloads on your clusters, we recommend that you don't use parallel
upgrades.
There are two parallel upgrade strategies that you can use to speed up your
cluster upgrade:
Concurrent node upgrade: you can configure your worker node pools so
that multiple nodes upgrade in parallel. Parallel upgrades of nodes are
configured in the NodePool spec ( spec.upgradeStrategy.parallelUpgrade ) and
only nodes in a worker node pool can be upgraded in parallel. Nodes in
control plane or load balancer node pools can only be upgraded one at a
time. For more information, see Node upgrade strategy .
Concurrent node pool upgrade: you can configure your cluster so that
multiple node pools upgrade in parallel. Only worker node pools can be
upgraded in parallel. Control plane and load balancer node pools can only be
upgraded one at a time.
Node upgrade strategy
You can configure worker node pools so that multiple nodes upgrade concurrently
( concurrentNodes ). You can also set a minimum threshold for the number of
nodes able to run workloads throughout the upgrade process
( minimumAvailableNodes ). This configuration is made in the NodePool spec. For
more information about these fields, see the
Cluster configuration field reference .
Important: Parallel upgrades don't honor the
Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) .
If your workloads are sensitive to disruptions, we recommend that you use the
minimumAvailableNodes field. You can specify the minimum quantity of nodes
that must remain available to run workloads throughout the upgrade process.
The node upgrade strategy applies to worker node pools only. You can't specify a node upgrade strategy for control plane or load balancer node pools. During a cluster
upgrade, nodes in control plane and load balancer node pools upgrade
sequentially, one at a time. Control plane node pools and load balancer node
pools are specified in the Cluster spec ( controlPlane.nodePoolSpec.nodes and
loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec.nodes ).
When you configure parallel upgrades for nodes, note the following restrictions:
The value of concurrentNodes can't exceed either 50 percent of the number of
nodes in the node pool, or the fixed number 15, whichever is smaller.
For example, if your node pool has 20 nodes, you can't specify a value
greater than 10. If your node pool has 100 nodes, 15 is the maximum value
you can specify.
When you use concurrentNodes together with minimumAvailableNodes , the
combined values can't exceed the total number of nodes in the node pool. For
example, if your node pool has 20 nodes and minimumAvailableNodes is set to
18, concurrentNodes can't exceed 2. Likewise, if concurrentNodes is set to
10, minimumAvailableNodes can't exceed 10.
The following example shows a worker node pool np1 with 10 nodes. In an
upgrade, nodes upgrade 5 at a time and at least 4 nodes must remain
available for the upgrade to proceed:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : NodePool
metadata :
name : np1
namespace : cluster-cluster1
spec :
clusterName : cluster1

- address : 10.200.0.9
- address : 10.200.0.10
upgradeStrategy :
parallelUpgrade :
concurrentNodes : 5
minimumAvailableNodes : 4
Node pool upgrade strategy
You can configure a cluster so that multiple worker node pools upgrade in
parallel. The nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.concurrentNodePools Boolean field in the
cluster spec specifies whether or not to upgrade all worker node pools for a
cluster concurrently. By default ( 1 ), node pools upgrade
sequentially, one after the other. When you set concurrentNodePools
to 0 , every worker node pool in the cluster upgrades in parallel.
Control plane and load balancing node pools are not affected by this setting.
These node pools always upgrade sequentially, one at a time. Control plane node
pools and load balancer node pools are specified in the Cluster spec
( controlPlane.nodePoolSpec.nodes and loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec.nodes ).

How to perform a parallel upgrade
This section describes how to configure a cluster and a worker node pool for
parallel upgrades.
To perform a parallel upgrade of worker node pools and nodes in a worker node
pool, do the following:
Add an upgradeStrategy section to the NodePool spec.
You can apply this manifest separately or as part of the cluster
configuration file when you perform a cluster update.
Here's an example:
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : NodePool
metadata :
name : np1
namespace : cluster-ci-bf8b9aa43c16c47
spec :
clusterName : ci-bf8b9aa43c16c47
nodes :
- address : 10.200.0.1
- address : 10.200.0.2
- address : 10.200.0.3
...
- address : 10.200.0.30
upgradeStrategy :
parallelUpgrade :
concurrentNodes : 5
minimumAvailableNodes : 10
In this example, the value of the field concurrentNodes is 5 , which
means that 5 nodes upgrade in parallel. The minimumAvailableNodes field is
set to 10 , which means that at least 10 nodes must remain available for
workloads throughout the upgrade.
Note: You can't specify a node upgrade strategy for control plane or load
balancer node pools.
Add an nodePoolUpgradeStrategy section to the Cluster spec in the
cluster configuration file.
---
apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
name : cluster-user001
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : user001
namespace : cluster-user001
spec :
type : user
profile : default
anthosBareMetalVersion : 1.34.200-gke.68
...
nodePoolUpgradeStrategy :
concurrentNodePools : 0
...
In this example, the concurrentNodePools field is set to 0 , which means
that all worker node pools upgrade concurrently during the cluster upgrade.
The upgrade strategy for the nodes in the node pools is defined in the
NodePool specs.
Upgrade the cluster as described in the preceding
Upgrade admin, standalone, hybrid, or user clusters
section.
Parallel upgrade default values
Parallel upgrades are disabled by default and the fields related to parallel
upgrades are mutable. At any time, you can either remove the fields or set them
to their default values to disable the feature before a subsequent upgrade.
The following table lists the parallel upgrade fields and their default values:
Field
Default value
Meaning
nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.concurrentNodePools (Cluster spec)
1
Upgrade worker node pools sequentially, one after the other.
upgradeStrategy.parallelUpgrade.concurrentNodes (NodePool spec)
1
Upgrade nodes sequentially, one after the other.
upgradeStrategy.parallelUpgrade.minimumAvailableNodes (NodePool spec)
The default minimumAvailableNodes value depends on the value of concurrentNodes .
If you don't specify concurrentNodes , then minimumAvailableNodes by default is 2/3 the node pool size.
If you do specify concurrentNodes , then minimumAvailableNodes by default is the node pool size minus concurrentNodes .
Upgrade stalls once minimumAvailableNodes is reached and only continues once the number of available nodes is greater than minimumAvailableNodes .
Start the cluster upgrade
This section contains instructions for upgrading clusters.
Note: You should upgrade an admin cluster before upgrading any associated user
clusters. However, before upgrading the admin cluster to 1.34.200-gke.68 ,
make sure its associated user clusters are at version 1.33.0 or
higher. bmctl emits an error if it finds any user cluster is with a version
lower than 1.33.0 .
bmctl
When you download and install a new version of bmctl , you can upgrade your
admin, hybrid, standalone, and user clusters created with an earlier version.
For a given version of bmctl , a cluster can be upgraded to the same version
only.
Set your user credentials as Application Default Credentials (ADC):
gcloud auth application-default login
Follow the prompts to select your Google Account for ADC. For more
information, see Set up Application Default
Credentials .
Download the latest bmctl as described in
Google Distributed Cloud downloads .
Update anthosBareMetalVersion in the cluster configuration file to the
upgrade target version.
The upgrade target version must match the version of the downloaded
bmctl file. The following cluster configuration file snippet shows the
anthosBareMetalVersion field updated to the latest version:
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : cluster1
namespace : cluster-cluster1
spec :
type : admin
# Anthos cluster version.
anthosBareMetalVersion : 1.34.200-gke.68
Use the bmctl upgrade cluster command to complete the upgrade:
bmctl upgrade cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster to upgrade.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path to the admin cluster
kubeconfig file.
Note: The bmctl upgrade command updates only the
anthosBareMetalVersion value and preview annotations in the Cluster
custom resource. If you want to modify other fields of the cluster spec,
then use the bmctl update command. For more information, see
Update clusters .
The cluster upgrade operation runs preflight checks to validate cluster
status and node health. The cluster upgrade doesn't proceed if the
preflight checks fail. For troubleshooting information, see
Troubleshoot cluster install or upgrade issues .
When all of the cluster components have been successfully upgraded, the
cluster upgrade operation performs cluster health checks. This last step
verifies that the cluster is in good operating condition. If the cluster
doesn't pass all health checks, they continue to run until they pass. When
all health checks pass, the upgrade finishes successfully.
For more information about the sequence of events for cluster upgrades,
see Lifecycle and stages of cluster upgrades .
kubectl
To upgrade a cluster with kubectl , perform the following steps:
Edit the cluster configuration file to set anthosBareMetalVersion to the
upgrade target version.
To initiate the upgrade, run the following command:
kubectl apply -f CLUSTER_CONFIG_PATH
Replace CLUSTER_CONFIG_PATH with the path of the
edited cluster configuration file.
As with the upgrade process with bmctl , preflight checks are run as part of
the cluster upgrade to validate cluster status and node health. If the preflight
checks fail, the cluster upgrade is halted. To troubleshoot any failures,
examine the cluster and related logs, since no bootstrap cluster is created. For
more information, see
Troubleshoot cluster install or upgrade issues .
Although you don't need the latest version of bmctl to upgrade cluters with
kubectl , we recommend that you
download the latest bmctl . You need bmctl to
perform other tasks, such as health checks and backups, to ensure that your
cluster stays in good working order.
Pause and resume upgrades
The upgrade pause and resume feature lets you pause a cluster upgrade before it
finishes. When a cluster upgrade is paused, no new worker node upgrades are
triggered until the upgrade is resumed.
This feature is available in ( Preview ) for
clusters with all control plane nodes at minor version 1.28 or higher. The
feature is GA for clusters with all control plane nodes at minor version 1.29 or
higher.
You might want to pause an upgrade for the following reasons:
You've detected something wrong with cluster workloads during the upgrade
and you want to pause the upgrade to look into the issue
You have short maintenance windows, so you want to pause the upgrade in
between windows
While a cluster upgrade is paused, the following operations are supported:
Adding or removing nodes
Adding or removing node pools
Increasing service network range
Restore a cluster from a backup
When a new node is added while an upgrade is paused, machine check jobs don't
run on it until the upgrade is resumed and completed.
While the cluster upgrade is paused, the following cluster operations aren't
supported:
Rotating certificate authorities
Backing up a cluster
You can't initiate a new cluster upgrade while an active cluster upgrade is
paused.
Enable upgrade pause and resume
Google Distributed Cloud 1.34
The upgrade pause and resume feature is enabled by default for clusters with
all control plane nodes at minor version 1.29 or higher.
Google Distributed Cloud 1.33
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
While the upgrade pause and resume capability is in Preview, you can
enable it with an annotation in the Cluster resource.
To enable upgrade pause and resume, use the following steps:
Add the preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/upgrade-pause-and-resume
annotation to your cluster configuration file:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : baremetal-demo
namespace : cluster-baremetal-demo
annotations :
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/upgrade-pause-and-resume : enable
spec :
...
To apply the change, update your cluster:
bmctl update cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME --kubeconfig = ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster you want to
update.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : for admin, hybrid, or standalone
clusters, enter the path to the cluster's kubeconfig file. For a user
cluster, enter the path to the admin cluster's kubeconfig file.
The
nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.pause
field is mutable. You can add and update it at any time.
Pause an upgrade
You pause a cluster upgrade by setting nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.pause to true
in the Cluster spec.
To pause an active cluster upgrade, use the following steps:
Add nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.pause to the cluster configuration file and
set it to true :
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : baremetal-demo
namespace : cluster-baremetal-demo
...
spec :
...
nodePoolUpgradeStrategy :
pause : true
...
If you used bmctl to initiate the upgrade, you need a new terminal window
to perform the next step.
To apply the change, update your cluster:
bmctl update CLUSTER_NAME
The upgrade operation is paused. No new node upgrades are triggered.
If you used bmctl to initiate the upgrade and you're planning for a
long-lasting pause, press Control+C to exit bmctl , otherwise,
keep bmctl running.
The bmctl CLI doesn't detect changes in the upgrade pause status, so it
doesn't exit automatically. However, when you exit bmctl , it stops logging
upgrade progress to the cluster-upgrade- TIMESTAMP log
file in the cluster folder on your admin workstation and to
Cloud Logging. Therefore, for short pauses, you may want to keep bmctl
running. If you leave bmctl running for an extended period while the
upgrade is paused, it eventually times out.
Resume a paused upgrade
You resume a paused cluster upgrade by either setting
nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.pause to false in the Cluster spec or removing
nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.pause from the spec.
To resume a cluster upgrade that's been paused, use the following steps:
Set nodePoolUpgradeStrategy.pause to the cluster configuration file and
set it to false :
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : baremetal-demo
namespace : cluster-baremetal-demo
...
spec :
...
nodePoolUpgradeStrategy :
pause : false
...
Alternatively, you can remove the pause field, because it defaults to
false .
To apply the change, update your cluster:
bmctl update CLUSTER_NAME
The upgrade operation resumes where it left off.
To check the status of the upgrade, first get a list of the resources that
have anthosBareMetalVersion in their status :
kubectl get RESOURCE --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG --all_namespaces
Replace the following:
RESOURCE : the name of the resource that you want to
get. Cluster , NodePool , and BareMetalMachine resources all contain
anthosBareMetalVersion status information.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path of the admin cluster
kubeconfig file.
The following sample shows the format of the response for BareMetalMachine
custom resources. Each BareMetalMachine corresponds to a cluster node.
NAMESPACE NAME CLUSTER READY INSTANCEID MACHINE ABM VERSION DESIRED ABM VERSION
cluster-nuc-admin001 192.0.2.52 nuc-admin001 true baremetal://192.0.2.52 192.0.2.52 1.28.0 1.28.0
cluster-nuc-user001 192.0.2.53 nuc-user001 true baremetal://192.0.2.53 192.0.2.53 1.16.2 1.16.2
cluster-nuc-user001 192.0.2.54 nuc-user001 true baremetal://192.0.2.54 192.0.2.54 1.16.2 1.16.2
To check the status.anthosBareMetalVersion (current version of the
resource), retrieve details for individual resources:
kubectl describe RESOURCE RESOURCE_NAME \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG \
--namespace CLUSTER_NAMESPACE
The following sample shows the BareMetalMachine details for the cluster
node with IP address 192.0.2.53 :
Name : 192.0.2.53
Namespace : cluster-nuc-user001
...
API Version : infrastructure.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
Kind : BareMetalMachine
Metadata :
Creation Timestamp : 2023-09-22T17:52:09Z
...
Spec :
Address : 192.0.2.53
Anthos Bare Metal Version : 1.16.2
...
Status :
Anthos Bare Metal Version : 1.16.2
In this example, the node is at Google Distributed Cloud version 1.16.2.
