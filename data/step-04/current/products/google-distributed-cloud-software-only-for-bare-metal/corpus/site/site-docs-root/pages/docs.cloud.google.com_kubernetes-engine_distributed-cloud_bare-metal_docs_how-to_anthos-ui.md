Manage clusters from the Google Cloud console
Stay organized with collections

This document explains how to make admin and user clusters created with
Google Distributed Cloud software on bare metal available for management in the
Google Cloud console. Cluster management capabilities include being able to log in
to clusters, view workloads, upgrade, update, and delete clusters.
Fleet members and the console
All clusters must be members of a
fleet —a unified way to view
and manage multiple clusters and their workloads. Each fleet of clusters
is associated with a
fleet host project .
All clusters are registered to a fleet at creation time:
When you create a cluster using bmctl , you specify your fleet host project
in the gkeConnect section of the cluster configuration file.
The cluster becomes a fleet member of the specified project.
When you create an admin or user cluster with a standard GKE On-Prem API
client (the console, the Google Cloud CLI, or Terraform), the
cluster becomes a fleet member in the specified project.
Fleet members outside of Google Cloud, like Google Distributed Cloud, are displayed
in the console in your fleet host project, along with other
fleet clusters such as GKE on Google Cloud. The extent to
which you can manage bare metal clusters from the console
depends on the following:
If you have set up authentication , you can
log in to your clusters and view their workloads and other details.
If you have enabled cluster lifecycle
management for the
cluster, you can upgrade admin and users clusters by using the
console, and you can use the console to update and
delete user clusters. If this feature isn't enabled, you can only manage
cluster lifecycle using bmctl on your admin workstation.
View registered clusters
All your clusters are displayed on the
GKE clusters
page in the console. This both gives you an overview of your
entire fleet and, for Google Distributed Cloud, lets you see which clusters are
managed by the GKE On-Prem API.
To view your fleet clusters:
In the console, go to the Google Kubernetes Engine clusters overview
page.
Go to GKE clusters
Select the Google Cloud project.
If Bare metal is displayed in the Type column, the cluster
is managed by the GKE On-Prem API. Note, only admin and user clusters
can be managed by the GKE On-Prem API.
If External is displayed in the Type column, the cluster isn't
managed by the GKE On-Prem API.
To see more details about a cluster, you need to log in and authenticate to
the cluster. To do this, you need to do the following steps:
Set up an authentication method
Grant users specific Identity and Access Management roles
Set up authentication
As described previously, all clusters appear in the GKE
clusters page in the console. However, to see more details such as
nodes and workloads (and to do cluster lifecycle management tasks if the
feature is enabled), you need to log in and authenticate to the cluster. To do
this, your clusters must be set up with one of the following authentication
methods:
Google identity : This option lets you log in using your
Google Cloud identity, which is the email address associated with your
Google Cloud account. Use this option if users already have access to
Google Cloud with their Google identity. If you created the cluster in
the console, you can log in to the cluster using your
Google identity, but you will need to configure authentication for other users.
Login with Google identity is the simplest approach to authentication in the
console, so we've described how to set this up in more detail in
Set up Google identity authentication .
OpenID Connect (OIDC) : This option lets you log in to clusters from the
console using their identity from a third-party OIDC identity
provider such as Okta or Microsoft AD FS. You might want to use this option if
your users have existing usernames, passwords, and security group memberships
from your provider. You can find out how to set up third-party OIDC
authentication for your clusters in the following guides:
Configure clusters for GKE Identity Service with OIDC :
This guide shows you how to set up OIDC authentication on a cluster by
cluster basis.
Set up GKE Identity Service for a fleet :
This option lets you set up OIDC at the fleet level.
Bearer token : If the preceding Google-provided solutions aren't suitable for
your organization, you can set up authentication using a Kubernetes service
account and using its bearer token to log in. For details, see
Set up using a bearer token .
Grant required roles
Access to the console is controlled by Identity and Access Management (IAM).
To manage the cluster lifecycle in the console you need to grant
some IAM roles to users who aren't project owners:
To let users access the console, at a minimum, you need to
grant the following roles:
roles/container.viewer : This role lets users view the GKE
Clusters page and other container resources in the console.
For details about the permissions included in this role, or to grant a
role with read and write permissions, see
Kubernetes Engine roles
in the IAM documentation.
roles/gkehub.viewer : This role lets users view clusters outside
Google Cloud in the console. For details about the
permissions included in this role, or to grant a role with read and write
permissions, see
GKE Hub roles in the
IAM documentation.
To let users manage the cluster lifecycle in the console,
grant the roles/gkeonprem.admin IAM role. The
roles/gkeonprem.admin role gives users administrative access to the
GKE On-Prem API, which the console uses to manage the
cluster lifecycle. For details on the permissions included in this role, see
GKE on-prem roles
in the IAM documentation.
The following commands shows how to grant the minimal roles needed to manage
cluster lifecycle in the console:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member= MEMBER \
--role=roles/container.viewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member= MEMBER \
--role=roles/gkehub.viewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member= MEMBER \
--role=roles/gkeonprem.admin
where:
PROJECT_ID is the fleet host project. For clusters
created using bmctl , this is the project that you configured in the
gkeConnect section of the user cluster's configuration file. For
clusters created in the console, this is the project
that you chose when the cluster was created.
MEMBER is the user's email address in the format
user:emailID , for example: user:alice@example.com
Enable cluster lifecycle management in the console
Admin and user clusters created by using standard tools (the
console, the gcloud CLI, or Terraform) are
automatically enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API, which lets you perform cluster
lifecycle management tasks in the console. In Google Distributed Cloud
1.16 and higher, when you create user and admin clusters using bmctl , they are
enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API by default. If you need to enroll a cluster in
the GKE On-Prem API, follow the steps in
Configure a cluster to be managed by the GKE On-Prem API .
Note: If your cluster is enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API, you can use also use
bmctl on your admin workstation to manage the cluster lifecycle.
Set up Google identity authentication
To let users log in to the cluster using their Google identity, you need to
configure the following:
Users need specific Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to be able to see and
interact with clusters in the console on the
GKE clusters
page.
Users need to be added to the Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC)
policies that the connect gateway
needs to access the cluster's Kubernetes API server using the
Connect Agent .
Configure RBAC authorization
Each cluster's Kubernetes API server needs to be able to authorize requests that
come from the console. To configure authorization, you need to
configure Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies for users on each
cluster. Your Google Account is added as an administrator with full access to a
user cluster in the following cases:
You created the user cluster in the console.
You created the user cluster using the gcloud CLI, and your
Google Account was specified in the --admin-users flag in the cluster
create command.
You created the user cluster using Terraform and your Google Account was
specified in the authorization.admin_users.username field.
You created the user cluster using bmctl and configured your Google Account
in the
clusterSecurity.authorization.clusterAdmin.gcpAccounts .
You can add others as administrators after the cluster is created. You can use
any of the following ways to grant administrative access to the cluster. Two
different gcloud commands are provided.
The gcloud ... generate-gateway-rbac command needs to be run on your admin
workstation because the command requires access to the cluster's kubeconfig
and context (which are typically only on your admin workstation). The
generate-gateway-rbac command lets you customize the RBAC
policies, but the user email addresses won't be displayed as administrators in
the Cluster Details section in the console.
The gcloud ... update command can be run on either your admin workstation
or any computer that has access to the GKE On-Prem API.
Note that if you created an admin cluster in the Google Cloud console, you
are granted read-only access to the cluster. If you want to be granted the
clusterrole/cluster-admin role, someone with that role will need to add
you using the gcloud ... generate-gateway-rbac command.
generate-gateway-rbac
To apply the RBAC policies to users, do the following steps on your admin
workstation:
Run the following command to update components (if needed):
gcloud components update
Generate and apply the RBAC policies to your cluster for users and service
accounts:
gcloud container fleet memberships generate-gateway-rbac \
--membership = MEMBERSHIP_NAME \
--role = ROLE \
--users = USERS \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--kubeconfig = KUBECONFIG_PATH \
--context = KUBECONFIG_CONTEXT \
--apply
Replace the following:
MEMBERSHIP_NAME : the name used to uniquely represent the
cluster in its fleet. In Google Distributed Cloud, the membership name and
the cluster name are the same.
ROLE : the Kubernetes role you want to grant to the users on
the cluster. To grant users full access to every resource in the cluster
in all namespaces, specify clusterrole/cluster-admin . To provide
read-only access, specify clusterrole/view . To restrict access,
create a custom role, for example: role/mynamespace/namespace-reader .
The custom role must already exist before you run the command.
USERS : the email addresses of the users (user accounts or
service accounts) to whom you want to grant the permissions, as a
comma-separated list. For example:
--users=222larabrown@gmail.com,test-acct@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the fleet host project.
KUBECONFIG_PATH : the local path of your kubeconfig file that
contains an entry for the cluster.
KUBECONFIG_CONTEXT : the context of the cluster as it appears in
the kubeconfig file. You can get the current context from the command line
by running kubectl config current-context . Whether you use the current
context or not, make sure that it works for accessing the cluster by
running a command such as:
kubectl get namespaces \
--kubeconfig= KUBECONFIG_PATH \
--context= KUBECONFIG_CONTEXT
After running gcloud container fleet memberships generate-gateway-rbac ,
you see something like the following at the end of the output, which is
truncated for readability:
Validating input arguments.
Specified Cluster Role is: clusterrole/cluster-admin
Generated RBAC policy is:
--------------------------------------------
...
Applying the generate RBAC policy to cluster with kubeconfig: /usr/local/google/home/foo/.kube/config, context: kind-kind
Writing RBAC policy for user: foo@example.com to cluster.
Successfully applied the RBAC policy to cluster.
This is the context for accessing the cluster through the
connect gateway .
For more details on the generate-gateway-rbac command, see the
gcloud CLI reference guide .
update
Run the following command to update components:
gcloud components update
For each user that needs to be granted the clusterrole/cluster-admin
role, include the --admin-users flag and run the following command.
You can't specify multiple users in a single flag. Be sure to include your
Google Account in the command because the command overwrites the grant
list with the users that you specify in the command.
gcloud container bare-metal clusters update USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
--admin-users YOUR_GOOGLE_ACCOUNT \
--admin-users ADMIN_GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_1 \
In addition to granting the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, the
command grants the RBAC policies the users need to access the cluster
through the Connect gateway .
bmctl
To apply the RBAC policies to users, do the following steps on your admin
workstation:
Add the
clusterSecurity.authorization
section to your cluster configuration file. Specify your email address and
the email address of other users who need to administer the cluster. For
example:
...
clusterSecurity :
authorization :
clusterAdmin :
gcpAccounts : [ alex@example.com , hao@example.com , sasha@example.com ]
...
Note: This field only applies to clusters that can run workloads. You
can't specify gcpAccounts for admin clusters.
Update the cluster:
bmctl update cluster \
-c CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig = KUBECONFIG
Make the following changes:
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name of the cluster you want to
update.
If the cluster is a self-managing cluster (such as admin or standalone
cluster), replace KUBECONFIG with the path to the cluster's
kubeconfig file. If the cluster is a user cluster, replace
KUBECONFIG with the path to the admin cluster's kubeconfig
file.
Console
To apply the RBAC policies to users, do the following steps in the
console:
In the console, go to the Google Kubernetes Engine clusters overview
page.
Go to GKE clusters
Select the Google Cloud project that the user cluster is in.
In the cluster list, click the name of the cluster, and then click
View details in the Details panel.
In the Authorization section , click the Admin users field and
enter the email address of each user.
When you are finished adding users, click Done .
Note: When you add admin users, the GKE On-Prem API applies the Kubernetes
RBAC policies to the cluster to grant the users the same administrative access
that you were granted when you created the cluster. These policies grant users
the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, which provides full access to
every resource in the cluster in all namespaces.
