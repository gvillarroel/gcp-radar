Use Kubernetes audit logging
Stay organized with collections

This document describes how to use Cloud Audit Logs for Google Distributed Cloud (software only). Google Distributed Cloud uses Kubernetes Audit Logging , which keeps a chronological record of calls made to a cluster Kubernetes API server. Audit logs are useful for investigating suspicious API requests and for collecting statistics. For information about audit logging for the GKE On-Prem API, see Cloud API audit logging .
Note: Starting with Google Distributed Cloud release 1.9.0, Cloud Audit Logs is
enabled by default. Cloud Audit Logs is automatically enabled for 1.8.x clusters
that are upgraded to 1.34.200-gke.68 unless it was explicitly disabled for the
1.8.x cluster by setting disableCloudAuditLogging to true .
About Cloud Audit Logs
Audit logs are written to Cloud Audit Logs in your Google Cloud project. Writing to Cloud Audit Logs has several benefits over writing to disk or capturing logs in an on-premises logging system:
Audit logs for all clusters can be centralized.
Log entries written to Cloud Audit Logs are immutable.
Cloud Audit Logs entries are retained for 400 days.
The Cloud Audit Logs feature is included in the price of Google Distributed Cloud.
You can configure Google Distributed Cloud to write logs to disk or to Cloud Audit Logs.
Disk-based audit logging
If Cloud Audit Logs is disabled explicitly, audit logs are written to a persistent
disk so that cluster restarts and upgrades don't cause the logs to disappear.
Google Distributed Cloud software-only retains up to 1 GiB of audit log
entries.
Access the disk-based audit logs by logging into control plane Nodes. The logs
are located in the /var/log/apiserver/ directory.
Cloud Audit Logs
Admin Activity audit log entries from all Kubernetes API servers are sent to
Google Cloud, using the project and location that you specify when you
create a user cluster. To buffer and write log entries to Cloud Audit Logs,
Google Distributed Cloud deploys an audit-proxy daemon set that runs on the control
plane nodes.
Limitations
Cloud Audit Logs has the following limitations:
Data access logging (get, list, watch requests) isn't supported.
Modifying the Kubernetes audit policy is not supported.
Cloud Audit Logs isn't resilient to extended network outages. If the log entries can't be exported to Google Cloud, they are cached in a 10GB disk buffer. If that buffer fills, then the oldest entries are dropped.
One project can support up to approximately 1000 service accounts for use with Cloud Audit Logs. Multiple clusters can use the same service account.
Create a service account for Cloud Audit Logs
Before you can use Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring with
Google Distributed Cloud software-only, you must first configure the following:
Create a Cloud Monitoring Workspace within the Google Cloud project, if you
don't have one already.
In the Google Cloud console, click the following button and follow the
workflow.
Go to Monitoring
Click the following buttons to enable the required APIs:
Enable the Anthos Audit API
Enable the Stackdriver API
Enable the Monitoring API
Enable the Logging API
Assign the following IAM roles to the service account used by
the Stackdriver agents:
logging.logWriter
monitoring.metricWriter
stackdriver.resourceMetadata.writer
monitoring.dashboardEditor
Warning: before deleting this service account, be sure to replace it with the
new service account in the cluster configuration first! See Rotate service
account keys . If you forget to do this,
follow the guide to clean
up .
Access Cloud Audit Logs
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Logs Explorer page in the Logging menu.
Go to the Logs Explorer
If the Legacy Logs Viewer page opens, choose Upgrade to the new Logs Explorer from the Upgrade drop-down menu.
Click in the Query field to enter a query.
Enter the following query into the Query field:
resource.type="k8s_cluster"
logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/externalaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"
protoPayload.serviceName="anthosgke.googleapis.com"
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Click Run query to display all audit logs from clusters that were configured to sign in to this project.
gcloud
List the first two log entries in your project's Admin Activity log that apply to the k8s_cluster resource type:
gcloud logging read \
'logName="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/externalaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity" \
AND resource.type="k8s_cluster" \
AND protoPayload.serviceName="anthosgke.googleapis.com" ' \
--limit 2 \
--freshness 300d
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
The output shows two log entries. Notice that for each log entry, the logName field has the value projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/externalaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity and protoPayload.serviceName is equal to anthosgke.googleapis.com .
Audit policy
The Kubernetes audit policy defines rules for which events are recorded as log entries and specifies what data the log entries should include. Cloud Audit Logs behavior is determined by a statically-configured Kubernetes audit logging policy. Changing this policy to modify Cloud Audit Logs behavior isn't supported.
