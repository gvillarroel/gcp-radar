Configure nodes to authenticate to a private registry
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can configure your Google Distributed Cloud cluster so that its worker nodes
can use private registries, including Artifact Registry. Node-level private registries are intended for use
with your workloads to give you more control over image pulls and their related
security. When you configure a cluster with the private registries as described
in this document, Google Distributed Cloud updates the containerd configuration
accordingly. Once your cluster is configured, all Pods on qualified nodes can
use the registries without having to specify imagePullSecrets in the Pod spec.
This feature can be enabled or disabled at any time in the cluster lifecycle.
The following list shows the launch stage for this feature per version:
1.30 and later: GA
1.29: Preview
Prerequisites
1.30 and later
To use this GA feature, your cluster must meet the following requirements:
The cluster version must be at 1.30 or later.
The node pool version must be at 1.29 or later (a 1.30 cluster can have
node pools at version 1.28, but the feature only works for node pools at
version 1.29 or later).
This feature is for user clusters and self-managing (hybrid and standalone)
clusters with worker node pools, as shown in the following table:

Configure a self-managing cluster for private registries
To configure a standalone or hybrid cluster to use node-level private
registries:
Edit the cluster configuration file to add the privateRegistries block in
the credentials section:
---
gcrKeyPath : baremetal/gcr.json
sshPrivateKeyPath : .ssh/id_rsa
...
privateRegistries :
- host : REGISTRY_HOST
caCertPath : CA_CERT_PATH
pullCredentialConfigPath : CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH
...
---
apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
name : cluster-hybrid-basic
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : hybrid-basic
namespace : cluster-hybrid-basic
annotations :
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/private-registry : "enable" # Version 1.29 clusters only
...
spec :
type : hybrid
...
Replace the following:
REGISTRY_HOST : the domain name or IP address of
the private registry and the port. For example: 10.200.0.2:5007 .
CA_CERT_PATH : the path of the CA cert file (server
root CA). For example: /root/cert.pem . If your private registry
doesn't require a private TLS certificate, then you can omit this field.
CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH : the path of the
configuration file, config.json (for example,
$HOME/.docker/config.json ). To authenticate containerd to access your
private registry, config.json must contain a base64-encoded version of
your credentials in the auths section of the file.
For Artifact Registry, authenticate using a service account JSON key with the
following values:
username : _json_key
password : the entire contents of the service account JSON key
file. Enclose the pasted JSON key content in single quotes ( ' ) to
prevent parsing errors.
For more information about how to generate this file, see
Configure authentication to Artifact Registry for Docker
in the Artifact Registry documentation.
For other private registries, the base64-encoded auth string is
typically formed from USERNAME:PASSWORD , using your specific registry
credentials. If your private registry server doesn't require credentials
for authentication, then you can omit the pullCredentialConfigPath
field.
To protect sensitive data, you can use chown and chmod to restrict
access to the configuration file.
Apply the changes to your cluster:
bmctl update cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME --kubeconfig = CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster you want to
update.
CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG : path of the self-managed
(hybrid or standalone) cluster kubeconfig file.
Configure a user cluster for private registries
With user clusters, the private registry configuration is specified in the user
cluster resource spec, which is located in the admin cluster. Additionally, you
need to store the private registry credentials in a Secret, which is also
located in the admin cluster:
Create a kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson type Kubernetes Secret for the
registry credentials:
If you want to scope the Secret to a specific namespace, add the
--namespace flag to the following command to specify the name of the
namespace. If the Secret isn't in the same namespace as the cluster, add the
annotation baremetal.cluster.gke.io/mark-source: "true" , as shown in the
example at the end of this step.
kubectl create secret docker-registry CREDS_SECRET_NAME \
--from-file = .dockerconfigjson = CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH \
--kubeconfig = ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CREDS_SECRET_NAME : the name for your Secret.
CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH : the path of the
configuration file, config.json (for example,
$HOME/.docker/config.json ). To authenticate containerd to access your
private registry, config.json must contain a base64-encoded version of
your credentials in the auths section of the file.
For Artifact Registry, authenticate using a service account JSON key with the
following values:
username : _json_key
password : the entire contents of the service account JSON key
file. Enclose the pasted JSON key content in single quotes ( ' ) to
prevent parsing errors.
For more information about how to generate this file, see
Configure authentication to Artifact Registry for Docker
in the Artifact Registry documentation.
For other private registries, the base64-encoded auth string is
typically formed from USERNAME:PASSWORD , using your specific registry
credentials. If your private registry server doesn't require credentials
for authentication, then you can omit the pullCredentialSecretRef
field.
To protect sensitive data, you can use chown and chmod to restrict
access to the configuration file.
Your Secret should look similar to the following example:
apiVersion : v1
data :
.dockerconfigjson : ewoJImF1dGhzIjogewoJ...clpYSXdNak14IgoJCX0KCX0KfQ==
kind : Secret
metadata :
creationTimestamp : "2024-04-28T22:06:06Z"
name : private-registry-secret
namespace : default
resourceVersion : "5055821"
...
annotations :
...
baremetal.cluster.gke.io/mark-source : "true"
type : kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
If applicable, store the CA cert for the registry in a Secret.
The Secret looks similar to the following:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Secret
metadata :
annotations :
baremetal.cluster.gke.io/mark-source : "true"
name : ca-9dd74fd308bac6df562c7a7b220590b5
namespace : some-namespace
type : Opaque
data :
ca.crt : LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUR2RENDQXFTZ0F3SUJBZ0lVQi
3UGxjUzVFVk8vS0xuYjZiMHRhRFVleXJvd0RRWUpLb1pJaHZjTkFRRUwKQlFBd2ZqRUxNQWtHQ
...

LUVORCBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCg==
```
Edit the user cluster configuration file to enable and configure the private
registry:
For version 1.29 clusters only, add the
Preview feature annotation
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/private-registry: "enable" to enable
the feature. For version 1.30 and later clusters, the private registry
feature is enabled by default.
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : user-basic
namespace : cluster-user-basic
resourceVersion : "766027"
annotations :
...
preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/private-registry : "enable"
...
In the nodeConfig section of the user cluster configuration file, add
the privateRegistries block:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : user-basic
...
spec :
bypassPreflightCheck : false
...
nodeConfig :
containerRuntime : containerd
podDensity :
maxPodsPerNode : 250
privateRegistries :
- caCertSecretRef :
name : CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME
namespace : CA_CERT_SECRET_NAMESPACE
host : REGISTRY_HOST
pullCredentialSecretRef :
name : CREDS_SECRET_NAME
namespace : CREDS_SECRET_NAMESPACE
Replace the following:
CA_CERT_SECRET_NAME : the name of the Secret that
you created to store the CA cert. If you didn't create this secret,
remove the caCertSecretRef block.
CA_CERT_SECRET_NAMESPACE : the name of the namespace
for the CA cert Secret, if you created it.
REGISTRY_HOST : the domain name or IP address of the
private registry and the port. For example: 10.200.0.2:5007 .
CREDS_SECRET_NAME : the name of the
kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson type Secret for the registry
credentials.
CREDS_SECRET_NAMESPACE : the namespace name for the
Secret for the registry credentials.
Apply the changes to your cluster:
bmctl update cluster -c USER_CLUSTER_NAME --kubeconfig = ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
USER_CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster you are
updating.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : path of the admin cluster
kubeconfig file.
