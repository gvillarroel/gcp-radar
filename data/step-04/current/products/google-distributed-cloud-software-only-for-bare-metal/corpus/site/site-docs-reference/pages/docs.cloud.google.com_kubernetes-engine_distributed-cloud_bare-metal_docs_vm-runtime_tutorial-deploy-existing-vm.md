Tutorial: Deploy an existing VM in a cluster using VM Runtime on GDC
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides a step-by-step guide to deploy a virtual machine (VM)
based workload into an installation of Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on
bare metal using VM Runtime on GDC. The workload used in this
guide is the sample point of sale
application . This
application represents a typical point of sale
terminal that runs on on-premises
hardware at a retail store.
In this document, you migrate this application from a VM into a cluster and
access the application's web frontend. To migrate an existing VM into the
cluster, first a disk image of that VM must be created. Then, the image must be
hosted in a repository that the cluster can access. Finally, the URL of that
image can be used to create the VM. VM Runtime on GDC expects the
images to be in qcow2 format. If you provide a different image type, it's
automatically converted into the qcow2 format. To avoid repetitive conversion
and to enable reuse, you can convert a virtual disk image and
host the qcow2 image.
This document uses a pre-prepared image of a Compute Engine VM instance
where the workload runs as a systemd
service. You may follow these same steps to deploy your own application.
Objectives
Enable VM Runtime on GDC and install the virtctl plugin
Deploy the VM-based workload
Log in to the VM and check the application status
Access the VM-based workload
Before you begin
To complete this document you need the following resources:
Access to a version 1.12.0 or higher bare metal cluster that was created by
following the Install with Manual
Loadbalancer
guide. This document sets up networking resources so that you can access the
workload running inside the VM through a browser. If you don't need that
behavior, you can follow this document using any installation of
Google Distributed Cloud on bare metal.
A workstation that meets the following requirements:
Has access to your cluster using the
bmctl CLI.
Has access to your cluster using the
kubectl CLI.
Enable VM Runtime on GDC and install the virtctl plugin
The VM Runtime on GDC custom resource definition is part of all
bare metal clusters since version 1.10. An instance of the VMRuntime custom
resource is already created upon installation. However, it is disabled by
default.
Enable VM Runtime on GDC:
sudo bmctl enable vmruntime --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG_PATH
KUBECONFIG_PATH : Path of the user cluster
kubeconfig file.
Validate that the VMRuntime is enabled:
kubectl wait --for = jsonpath = '{.status.ready}' = true vmruntime vmruntime
It can take a few minutes for the VMRuntime to be ready. If it is not
ready, then check a few times with short delays. The following example
output shows the VMRuntime is ready:
vmruntime.vm.cluster.gke.io/vmruntime condition met
Install the
virtctl
plugin for kubectl :
sudo -E bmctl install virtctl
The following example output shows the virtctl plugin installation process
is complete:
Please check the logs at bmctl-workspace/log/install-virtctl-20220831-182135/install-virtctl.log
[ 2022 -08-31 18 :21:35+0000 ] Install virtctl succeeded
Verify installation of the virtctl plugin:
kubectl virt
The following example output shows that the virtctl plugin is available
for use with kubectl :
Available Commands:
addvolume add a volume to a running VM
completion generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
config Config subcommands.
console Connect to a console of a virtual machine instance.
create Create subcommands.
delete Delete subcommands.
...
Deploy the VM-based workload
When you deploy a VM into an installation of Google Distributed Cloud (software
only) on bare metal, VM Runtime on GDC expects a VM image. This
image serves as the boot disk for the deployed VM.
In this tutorial, you migrate a Compute Engine VM-based workload into a
cluster. This Compute Engine VM was created, and the sample point of sale
(PoS) application was configured to run as a systemd service. A disk image of
this VM along with the PoS application workload was
created
in Google Cloud. This image was then exported into a Cloud Storage bucket as
a qcow2 image . You use
this pre-prepared qcow2 image in the following steps.
Note: Although we use a Compute Engine VM in this document, the steps to
create a disk image of a VM vary depending on the environment or platform in
which your existing VM is running. You can create a disk image of your existing
VMs if you want to follow the steps in this document with your own custom image.
The source code in this document is available in the
anthos-samples GitHub
repository. You use resources from this repository to complete the steps that
follow.
Deploy a MySQL StatefulSet . The point of sale application expects to
connect to a MySQL database to store inventory and payment information. The
point of sale repository has a sample manifest that deploys a MySQL
StatefulSet , configures an associated ConfigMap , and a Kubernetes
Service . The ConfigMap defines the credentials for the MySQL instance,
which are the same credentials passed into the point of sale
application .
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/point-of-sale/main/k8-manifests/common/mysql-db.yaml
Deploy the VM workload using the pre-prepared qcow2 image:
kubectl virt create vm pos-vm \
--boot-disk-size = 80Gi \
--memory = 4Gi \
--vcpu = 2 \
--image = https://storage.googleapis.com/pos-vm-images/pos-vm.qcow2
This command creates a YAML file named after the VM
( google-virtctl/pos-vm.yaml ). You can inspect the file to see the
definition of the VirtualMachine and VirtualMachineDisk . Instead of
using the virtctl plugin, you could have deployed the VM workload using
Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) definitions ,
as seen in the created YAML file.
When the command runs successfully, it produces an output like the following
example that explains the different resources that were created:
Constructing manifest for vm "pos-vm" :
Manifest for vm "pos-vm" is saved to /home/tfadmin/google-virtctl/pos-vm.yaml
Applying manifest for vm "pos-vm"
Created gvm "pos-vm"
Check the VM creation status.
The VirtualMachine resource is identified by the
vm.cluster.gke.io/v1.VirtualMachine resource in VM Runtime on GDC.
The short form for it is gvm .
When you create a VM, the following two resources are created:
A VirtualMachineDisk is the persistent disk where the contents of
the VM image is imported into.
A VirtualMachine is the VM instance itself. The DataVolume is
mounted into the VirtualMachine before the VM is booted up.
Check the status of the VirtualMachineDisk. VirtualMachineDisk internally
creates a DataVolume resource. The VM image is imported into the
DataVolume which is mounted into the VM:
kubectl get datavolume
The following example output shows the start of the image import:
NAME PHASE PROGRESS RESTARTS AGE
pos-vm-boot-dv ImportScheduled N/A 8s
Check the status of the VirtualMachine . The VirtualMachine is in the
Provisioning state until the DataVolume is imported completely:
kubectl get gvm
The following example output shows the VirtualMachine being provisioned:
NAME STATUS AGE IP
pos-vm Provisioning 1m
Wait for the VM image to be fully imported into the DataVolume . Continue to
watch the progress while the image is imported:
kubectl get datavolume -w
The following example output shows the disk image being imported:
NAME PHASE PROGRESS RESTARTS AGE
pos-vm-boot-dv ImportInProgress 0 .00% 14s
...
...
pos-vm-boot-dv ImportInProgress 0 .00% 31s
pos-vm-boot-dv ImportInProgress 1 .02% 33s
pos-vm-boot-dv ImportInProgress 1 .02% 35s
...
When the import is complete and the DataVolume is created, the following
example output shows the PHASE of Succeeded :
kubectl get datavolume
NAME PHASE PROGRESS RESTARTS AGE
pos-vm-boot-dv Succeeded 100 .0% 14m18s
Note: The import time depends on the size of the VM image used. The
Compute Engine VM image in this document is about 5 GB and takes up to 15
minutes to import.
Confirm that the VirtualMachine has been created successfully:
kubectl get gvm
If the creation was successful the STATUS shows RUNNING , as
shown in the following example, along with the VM's IP address:
NAME STATUS AGE IP
pos-vm Running 40m 192 .168.3.250
Connect to the VM and check the application status
The image used for the VM includes the
point of sale sample application .
The application is configured to automatically start on boot as a systemd
service. You can see the systemd services' configuration files in the
pos-systemd-services
directory.
Connect to the VM console. Run the following command and press Enter⏎
after you see the Successfully connected to pos-vm… message:
kubectl virt console pos-vm
This command produces the following example output that prompts you to input
the login details:
Successfully connected to pos-vm console. The escape sequence is ^ ]
pos-from-public-image login:
Use the following user account and password. This account was set up inside
the original VM from which the image for the VM Runtime on GDC
VirtualMachine was created.
Login Username: abmuser
Password: abmworks
Check the status of the point of sale application services. The point of
sale application includes three services: API, Inventory, and Payments.
These services all run as system services.
The three services all connect to each other through localhost. However, the
application connects to the MySQL database using a mysql-db Kubernetes
Service
that was created in the earlier step . This behavior
means that the VM is automatically connected to the same network as the
Pods and Services , enabling seamless communication between VM workloads
and other containerized applications. You don't have to do anything extra to
make the Kubernetes Services reachable from the VMs deployed using
VM Runtime on GDC.
sudo systemctl status pos*
The following example output shows the status of the three services and root
system service, pos.service :

Exit the VM. To exit the console connection, use escape sequence ^] by
pressing Ctrl + ] .
Access the VM-based workload
If your cluster was set up by following the
Install with Manual Loadbalancer
guide, it has an Ingress resource called pos-ingress already created. This
resource routes the traffic from the external IP address of the Ingress Load
Balancer to the API server service of the point of sale sample application.
If your cluster doesn't have this Ingress resource, create it by applying
the following manifest:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-samples/main/anthos-bm-gcp-terraform/resources/manifests/pos-ingress.yaml
apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1
kind : Ingress
metadata :
name : pos-ingress
spec :
rules :
- http :
paths :
- path : /
pathType : Prefix
backend :
service :
name : api-server-svc
port :
number : 8080
Create a Kubernetes Service that routes traffic to the VM. The Ingress
resource routes traffic to this Service :
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-samples/main/anthos-vmruntime/pos-service.yaml
The following example output confirms the creation of a Service:
service/api-server-svc created
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
name : api-server-svc
spec :
selector :
kubevirt/vm : pos-vm
ports :
- protocol : TCP
port : 8080
targetPort : 8081
Get the external IP address of the Ingress load balancer. The Ingress
Loadbalancer routes traffic based on the Ingress resource rules. You
already have a pos-ingress rule to forward requests to the API server
Service . This Service forwards the requests to the VM:
INGRESS_IP = $( kubectl get ingress/pos-ingress -o jsonpath = '{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' )
echo $INGRESS_IP
The following example output shows the IP address of the Ingress load
balancer:
172 .29.249.159 # you might have a different IP address
Access the application by using the Ingress Loadbalancer IP address in a
browser. The following example screenshots shows the point of sale kiosk
with two items. You can click the items, more than once if you want to order
multiple of them, and place an order with the Pay button. This experience
shows that you have successfully deployed a VM-based workload into
a cluster using VM Runtime on GDC.

Clean up
You may delete all the resources created in this tutorial or delete only the
VM and keep reusable resources. Delete a VM
explains the available options in detail.
Delete All
Delete the VM Runtime on GDC VirtualMachine along with all
the resources:
kubectl virt delete vm pos-vm --all
The following example output confirms the deletion:
vm "pos-vm" used the following resources:
gvm: pos-vm
VirtualMachineDisk: pos-vm-boot-dv
Start deleting the resources:
Deleted gvm "pos-vm" .
Deleted VirtualMachineDisk "pos-vm-boot-dv" .
Delete only VM
Deleting only the VM preserves the VirtualMachineDisk that gets created.
This enables reuse of this VM image and saves time spent on importing the
image when creating a new VM.
kubectl virt delete vm pos-vm
The following example output confirms the deletion:
vm "pos-vm" used the following resources:
gvm: pos-vm
VirtualMachineDisk: pos-vm-boot-dv
Start deleting the resources:
Deleted gvm "pos-vm" .
What's next
The original VM used in this guide is a Compute Engine instance that
runs Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The image of this VM is publicly accessible through the
pos-vm-images
Cloud Storage bucket. For more information on how the VM was configured and its
image was created, see the instructions in the point-of-sale repository.
When you create a VM in a cluster using the kubectl virt create vm pos-vm
command, a YAML file named after the VM ( google-virtctl/pos-vm.yaml ) is
created. You can inspect the file to see the definition of the VirtualMachine
and VirtualMachineDisk . Instead of using the virtctl plugin, you can deploy
a VM using KRM definitions
as seen in the created YAML file.
