Create a Service and an Ingress
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows how to create a Kubernetes
Ingress
object in a user, hybrid, or standalone cluster for Google Distributed Cloud. An Ingress
is associated with one or more Services ,
each of which is associated with a set of
Pods .
Create a Deployment
Use the following steps to create a Deployment:
Create a Deployment manifest:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : hello-deployment
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
greeting : hello
replicas : 3
template :
metadata :
labels :
greeting : hello
spec :
containers :
- name : hello-world
image : "gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0"
env :
- name : "PORT"
value : "50000"
- name : hello-kubernetes
image : "gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0"
env :
- name : "PORT"
value : "8080"
For the purpose of this exercise, these are the important points to
understand about the Deployment manifest:
Each Pod that belongs to the Deployment has the greeting: hello label.
Each Pod has two containers.
The env fields specify that the hello-app containers listen on TCP
port 50000, and the node-hello containers listen on TCP port 8080. For
hello-app , you can see the effect of the PORT environment variable
by looking at the source
code .
Copy the manifest to a file named hello-deployment.yaml .
Create the Deployment:
kubectl apply --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -f hello-deployment.yaml
Replace CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
with the name of the kubeconfig file for your cluster.
Expose your Deployment with a Service
To provide a stable way for clients to send requests to the Pods of your
Deployment, create a Service:
Create a Service manifest that exposes your Deployment to clients inside
your cluster:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
name : hello-service
spec :
type : ClusterIP
selector :
greeting : hello
ports :
- name : world-port
protocol : TCP
port : 60000
targetPort : 50000
- name : kubernetes-port
protocol : TCP
port : 60001
targetPort : 8080
Copy the manifest to a file named hello-service.yaml .
Create the Service:
kubectl apply --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -f hello-service.yaml
Replace CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG with the name of the
kubeconfig file for your cluster.
View the Service:
kubectl --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get service hello-service --output yaml
The output shows the value of clusterIP that has been given to the Service.
For example:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
annotations :
...
spec :
clusterIP : 10.96.14.249
clusterIPs :
- 10.96.14.249
ipFamilies :
- IPv4
ipFamilyPolicy : SingleStack
ports :
- name : world-port
port : 60000
protocol : TCP
targetPort : 50000
- name : kubernetes-port
port : 60001
protocol : TCP
targetPort : 8080
selector :
greeting : hello
sessionAffinity : None
type : ClusterIP
status :
loadBalancer : {}
In the preceding output, the ports field is an array of ServicePort objects:
one named world-port and one named kubernetes-port . For more information
about the Service fields, see
ServiceSpec
in the Kubernetes documentation.
These are the ways a client can call the Service:
Using world-port : A client running on one of the cluster nodes
sends a request to the clusterIP on port (such as
10.96.14.249:60000 ). The ingress controller forwards the request to a
member Pod on targetPort (such as
POD_IP_ADDRESS :50000 , where
POD_IP_ADDRESS is the IP address
of a member Pod).
Using kubernetes-port : A client running on one of the cluster
nodes sends a request to the clusterIP on port
( 10.96.14.249:60001 ). The ingress controller forwards the request to a
member Pod on targetPort ( POD_IP_ADDRESS :8080 ).
Ingress components
These are some of the cluster components related to ingress:
Note: The Istio components that are preinstalled on Google Distributed Cloud
support ingress only. These components are not intended to provide general
service mesh capabilities. For information on setting up a fully functional
service mesh, see Setup in the Istio
documentation or Set up a multi-cluster mesh outside
Google Cloud
in the Cloud Service Mesh documentation.
The istio-ingress Deployment. This is the ingress proxy . The ingress
proxy forwards traffic to internal Services according to rules specified in
an Ingress object.
The istio-ingress Service. This Service exposes the istio-ingress
Deployment.
The istiod Deployment. This is the ingress controller . The ingress
controller watches the creation of
Ingress
objects and configures the ingress proxy accordingly.
All of these Istio in-cluster components are installed in the gke-system
namespace. This namespace doesn't conflict with a full Istio/Cloud Service Mesh
installation.
Create an Ingress
Use the following steps to create an Ingress:
Create an Ingress manifest:
apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1
kind : Ingress
metadata :
name : my-ingress
spec :
rules :
- http :
paths :
- path : /greet-the-world
pathType : Exact
backend :
service :
name : hello-service
port :
number : 60000
- path : /greet-kubernetes
pathType : Exact
backend :
service :
name : hello-service
port :
number : 60001
Copy the manifest to a file named my-ingress.yaml .
Create the Ingress:
kubectl apply --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -f my-ingress.yaml
When you create a user cluster, you specify a value for
loadbalancer.ingressVIP in the cluster configuration file. This IP address is
configured on the cluster load balancer. When you create an Ingress, the Ingress
is given this same VIP as its external IP address.
When a client sends a request to your user cluster ingress VIP, the request is
routed to your load balancer. The load balancer uses the istio-ingress Service
to forward the request to the ingress proxy, which runs in your user cluster.
The ingress proxy forwards the request to different backends depending on the
path in the request URL.
The /greet-the-world path
In your Ingress manifest, you can see a rule that says the path
/greet-the-world is associated with serviceName: hello-service and
servicePort: 60000 . Recall that 60000 is the port value in the world-port
section of your hello-service Service.
- name : world-port
port : 60000
protocol : TCP
targetPort : 50000
The ingress Service forwards the request to clusterIP :50000. The request then
goes to one of the member Pods of the hello-service Service. The container, in
that Pod, listening on port 50000 displays a Hello World! message.
The /greet-kubernetes path
In your Ingress manifest, you can see a rule that says the path
/greet-kubernetes is associated with serviceName: hello-service and
servicePort: 60001 . Recall that 60001 is the port value in the
kubernetes-port section of your hello-service Service.
- name : kubernetes-port
port : 60001
protocol : TCP
targetPort : 8080
The ingress Service forwards the request to clusterIP : 8080. The request then
goes to one of the member Pods of the hello-service Service. The container in
that Pod, listening on port 8080 , displays a Hello Kubernetes! message.
Test the Ingress
Test the Ingress using the /greet-the-world path:
curl CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP /greet-the-world
Replace CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP with the external IP address of
the Ingress.
The output shows a Hello, world! message:
Hello, world!
Version: 2.0.0
Hostname: ...
Test the Ingress using the /greet-kubernetes path:
curl CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP /greet-kubernetes
The output shows a Hello, Kubernetes! message:
Hello Kubernetes!
Disable bundled Ingress
The Ingress capability bundled with
Google Distributed Cloud supports ingress capabilities only. You may choose to
integrate with Istio or
Cloud Service Mesh .
These products offer additional benefits of a fully functional service mesh,
such as mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS), ability to manage authentication
between services, and workload observability. If you integrate with Istio or
Cloud Service Mesh, we recommend that you disable the bundled Ingress capability.
You can enable or disable bundled Ingress with the
spec.clusterNetwork.bundledIngress field in your cluster configuration file.
This field is available to version 1.13.0 clusters and higher only. The
bundledIngress field defaults to true and isn't present in the generated
cluster configuration file. This field is mutable and can be changed when you
create or update a version 1.13.0 or higher cluster.
To disable the bundled Ingress capability, add the bundledIngress field to
the clusterNetwork section of your cluster configuration file and set its
value to false, as shown in the following example:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
name : cluster-hybrid-basic
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : hybrid-basic
namespace : cluster-hybrid-basic
spec :
type : hybrid
profile : default
anthosBareMetalVersion : 1.13.0
gkeConnect :
projectID : project-fleet
controlPlane :
nodePoolSpec :
nodes :
- address : 10.200.0.2
clusterNetwork :
bundledIngress : false
pods :
cidrBlocks :
- 192.168.0.0/16
services :
cidrBlocks :
- 10.96.0.0/20
...
Set up HTTPS for Ingress
If you want to accept HTTPS requests from your clients, the ingress proxy must
have a certificate so it can prove its identity to your clients. This proxy
must also have a private key to complete the HTTPS handshake.
The following example uses these entities:
Ingress proxy: Participates in the HTTPS handshake, and then forwards
packets to member Pods of the hello-service Service.
Domain for the hello-service Service: altostrat.com in Example Org
Follow these steps:
Create a root certificate and private key. This example uses a root
certificate authority of root.ca.example.com in Root CA Example Org.
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj \
'/O=Root CA Example Inc./CN=root.ca.example.com' -keyout root-ca.key \
-out root-ca.crt
Create a certificate signing request:
openssl req -out server.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -subj \
"/CN=altostrat.com/O=Example Org"
Create a serving certificate for the ingress proxy.
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -CA root-ca.crt -CAkey root-ca.key -set_serial 0 \
-in server.csr -out server.crt
You have now created the following certificates and keys:
root-ca.crt : Certificate for the root CA
root-ca.key : Private key for the root CA
server.crt : Serving certificate for the ingress proxy
server.key : Private key for the ingress proxy
Create a Kubernetes Secret that holds the serving certificate and key.
kubectl create secret tls example-server-creds --key = server.key --cert = server.crt \
--namespace gke-system
The resulting Secret is named example-server-creds .
Note: TLS secrets must be defined in the gke-system namespace.
Create a Deployment and Service
If you created a Deployment and a Service in the HTTP portion of this guide,
leave those in place. If you did not, create them now, following the
steps described for HTTP.
Create an Ingress
Creating an Ingress for HTTPS is similar to creating an Ingress for
HTTP , but the Ingress spec for HTTPS includes a tls section
that specifies the host and a Secret. The hosts in the tls section need to
explicitly match the host in the rules section.
Warning: Don't create multiple Ingresses for the same host. When you use the
bundled ingress components , you're limited to a single
Ingress custom resource for a given host.
If your backend Service is in a separate namespace, then you need to create a
Service of type ExternalName
in the same namespace as the Ingress to route traffic to the backend Service.
The overall steps for creating an Ingress for HTTPS or HTTP are the same, except
for what you configure in the manifest file:
If you previously created an Ingress in the HTTP portion of
this document, delete that Ingress before proceeding.
kubectl --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete ingress my-ingress
To handle traffic for the Service that you created
previously , create a new Ingress manifest that
has a tls section:
The tls configuration enables HTTPS between clients and the ingress proxy.
apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1
kind : Ingress
metadata :
name : my-ingress-2
spec :
tls :
- hosts :
- altostrat.com
secretName : example-server-creds
rules :
- host : altostrat.com
http :
paths :
- path : /greet-the-world
pathType : Exact
backend :
service :
name : hello-service
port :
number : 60000
- path : /greet-kubernetes
pathType : Exact
backend :
service :
name : hello-service
port :
number : 60001
Save the manifest in a file named my-ingress-2.yaml , and create the
Ingress:
kubectl apply --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -f my-ingress-2.yaml
Confirm that the Ingress was created and is working properly by testing:
Test the /greet-the-world path:
curl -v --resolve altostrat.com:443: CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP \
https://altostrat.com/greet-the-world \
--cacert root-ca.crt
Output:
Hello, world!
Version: 2.0.0
Hostname: hello-deployment-5ff7f68854-wqzp7
Test the /greet-kubernetes path:
curl -v --resolve altostrat.com:443: CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP \
https://altostrat.com/greet-kubernetes --cacert root-ca.crt
Output:
Hello Kubernetes!
Create a LoadBalancer Service
A Service of type LoadBalancer is another way to expose your workloads outside
of your cluster. For instructions and an example for creating a service of type
LoadBalancer , see
Create a Service of type LoadBalancer in Deploy an application .
Cleaning up
Delete your Ingress:
kubectl --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete ingress INGRESS_NAME
Replace INGRESS_NAME with the name of
the Ingress, such as my-ingress or my-ingress-2 .
Delete your Service:
kubectl --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete service hello-service
Delete your Deployment:
kubectl --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete deployment hello-deployment
Delete your LoadBalancer Service:
kubectl --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete service service-does-not-use-nodeports
