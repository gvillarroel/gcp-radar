Add domains to the API server certificate
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A subject alternative name (SAN) is a feature of SSL certificates that lets you
define the domain names and subdomains that are secured by a certificate. On an
Google Distributed Cloud cluster, the default SANs for the Kubernetes API server
certificate include the IP and VIP addresses of the control plane nodes and the
Kubernetes DNS names. With the custom API server certificate extra SANs feature,
you can add additional domains, subdomains, and IP addresses as SANs to the
Kubernetes API server certificate for the cluster.
To specify custom SANs for the API server certificate, you use the
controlPlane.apiServerCertExtraSANs
field in the cluster configuration spec. This field takes a list of domain names
and IP addresses. This field is optional and mutable. You can add this field and
update it when you create a cluster or any time after.

Add domains during cluster creation
When you add extra SANs when you create a cluster, the Kubernetes API server
certificate includes the additional specified domains and IP addresses when the
cluster becomes available.
Add or update domains for an existing cluster
Because the apiServerCertExtraSANs field is mutable, you can add or update the
field at any time for existing clusters. When you modify the
apiServerCertExtraSANs field in the cluster, it triggers the following
activities:
The Google Distributed Cloud cluster controllers regenerate the API server
certificate to include the modified extra domains.
The cluster controllers restart the API server to reload the new
certificate.
The new values of apiServerCertExtraSANs are verified by a webhook to
ensure that they conform to the RFC 1035 domain name
conventions .
The control plane node pool enters a reconciling state.

API servers on each control plane node.

You might experience downtime when updating the API server certificate extra
SANs field on a running cluster:
On high availability (HA) clusters, API server instances restart
sequentially. You can still interact with the cluster during the certificate
update, because the load balancer distributes requests to each API server.
However, you might see a response indicating that the API server is shutting
down. If you see this response, retry the request.
On non-HA clusters, there might be a brief outage of about one minute while
an API server restarts to reload the new certificate.
The change takes 5-20 minutes to propagate to all API servers, depending on the
number of control plane nodes in the cluster and the load of the cluster.
