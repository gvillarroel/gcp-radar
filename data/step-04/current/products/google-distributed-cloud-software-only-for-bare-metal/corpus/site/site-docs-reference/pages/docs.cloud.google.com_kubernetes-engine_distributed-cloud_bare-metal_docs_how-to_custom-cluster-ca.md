Use custom cluster certificate authorities
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cluster certificate authorities (CAs) issue and sign certificates to enable
secure authentication and encryption between cluster components. By default, in
Google Distributed Cloud, the Cluster API creates the cluster CAs when you create
a new cluster. This document describes how you can use your own certificate
authorities with Google Distributed Cloud. Using custom cluster CAs gives you more
control over issuing and managing your cluster certificates. You can also
control trust, encryption algorithm parameters, the depth of subordinate
certificates, and their purpose.
To use custom CAs, you provide root CAs, consisting of a CA certificate file and
its corresponding private key file. You provide a CA certificate and key file
pair for each of the following required cluster CAs:
etcd CA : the certificate for the etcd CA certificate secures
communication from the Kubernetes API server to the etcd replicas and also
communication between etcd replicas.
cluster CA : the certificate for the cluster CA secures communication
between the Kubernetes API server and all internal Kubernetes API clients.
Clients include the kubelet, the controller manager, and the scheduler.
front-proxy CA : the certificate for the front-proxy CA secures
communication with
aggregated APIs .
You can provide a unique certificate-key pair for each CA or you can reuse a
certificate-key pair for more than one of the CAs.
You apply the certificate-key pairs during
cluster creation ( bmctl method only)
and CA rotation . The Custom Cluster CA
feature works with all cluster types: admin, user, hybrid, and standalone.
Note: When you create a user cluster with bmctl , you typically remove the
credentials section of the cluster configuration file. To specify custom cluster
CAs when you create a user cluster, specify only the custom cluster CA
certificate and private key paths in the credentials section.
Prerequisites
You're responsible for preparing your own root CAs according to the following
rules:
Custom CAs are root CAs, each consisting of a self-signed certificate file
and a private key file.
For your certificate, we recommend that you use the
Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format (see recommendation X.690 for ASN.1 encoding rules ).
Your certificate file should contain base64-encoded data preceded by
‑‑‑‑‑BEGIN CERTIFICATE‑‑‑‑‑ and followed by
‑‑‑‑END CERTIFICATE‑‑‑‑‑ .
For the private key, we recommend that you use the
Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1
format. Your key file should contain base64-encoded data preceded by
‑‑‑‑BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY‑‑‑‑ and followed by
‑‑‑‑END RSA PRIVATE KEY‑‑‑‑ .
To minimize potential cluster disruption, custom CAs shouldn't expire sooner
than five years. We recommend a longer expiration period, such as 10 to 30
years.
Make sure the certificate and key files are on the admin workstation where
you run bmctl commands.
The user who runs bmctl commands must have access to the directory in
which you store the files. We recommend that you put the files in an
existing directory used for certificates and keys. For example, you can
store the files in ~/baremetal/bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys along with your
service account keys.
The user who runs bmctl commands must have read access to the files.
Use a custom CA during cluster creation
When you create a
cluster
with bmctl , you first update the cluster configuration file to describe your
cluster features and settings. To use the Custom Cluster CA feature during
cluster creation, you have two options for specifying the custom cluster CAs in
the cluster configuration file:
Specify the paths for both the CA certificate files and the private key
files
Specify the paths for the private key files only
When you specify the private keys only, bmctl looks for the corresponding CA
certificate files in the same directory. Certificate files must have the same
name as the corresponding private key files and the .crt file extension. For
example, if the private key path is /custom-ca/cluster_ca.key , then bmctl
expects the certificate path to be /custom-ca/cluster_ca.crt .
In either case, the paths are specified in the credentials section of the
configuration file as shown in the following examples.
Example 1: Specify certificate and key paths
The following excerpt from a cluster configuration file shows how to specify
the paths to both the certificate and key files for each cluster CA. In this
example, the CA certificate and key files are in the same directory as the
service account JSON key files.
Note: For a user cluster, you remove the service account and SSH key paths from
the credentials section.
gcrKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/myproject-anthos-baremetal-gcr.json
...
cloudOperationsServiceAccountKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/myproject-anthos-baremetal-cloud-ops.json
clusterCACertPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/cluster_ca_cert.pem
clusterCAPrivateKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/cluster_ca_key.pem
etcdCACertPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/etcd_ca_cert.pem
etcdCAPrivateKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/etcd_ca_key.pem
frontProxyCACertPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/front_proxy_ca_cert.pem
frontProxyCAPrivateKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/front_proxy_ca_key.pem

apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
name : cluster-admin-test
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
...
Example 2: Specify private key paths only
The following excerpt from a cluster configuration file shows how to specify the
paths to key files only. In this example, the CA private key files are in the
same directory as the service account JSON key files. The corresponding CA
certificate files must be in the /.sa-keys directory, too. Certificate files
have the same filename as the key files, but with a .crt extension. So, the
etcd CA certificate file has the name etcd_ca.crt .
Note: For a user cluster, you remove the service account and SSH key paths from
the credentials section.
gcrKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/myproject-anthos-baremetal-gcr.json
...
cloudOperationsServiceAccountKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/myproject-anthos-baremetal-cloud-ops.json
clusterCAPrivateKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/cluster_ca_key.pem
etcdCAPrivateKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/etcd_ca_key.pem
frontProxyCAPrivateKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/front_proxy_ca_key.pem

apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
name : cluster-admin-test
---
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
...
Example 3: Reuse a single pair of CA certificate and key files
The following excerpt from a cluster configuration file shows how to specify the
paths to key files only. In this example, a single certificate-key pair is used
for all cluster CAs. The CA certificate and private key files are both in the
/custom-ca directory. Following the naming convention, the CA certificate
filename is custom_ca.crt .
Note: For a user cluster, you remove the service account and SSH key paths from
the credentials section.
gcrKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/myproject-anthos-baremetal-gcr.json
...
cloudOperationsServiceAccountKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/myproject-anthos-baremetal-cloud-ops.json
clusterCAPrivateKeyPath : /custom-ca/custom_ca.key
etcdCAPrivateKeyPath : /custom-ca/custom_ca.key
frontProxyCAPrivateKeyPath : /custom-ca/custom_ca.key

Use a custom CA during CA rotation
When you rotate CAs , you can specify the
paths for your custom cluster CA certificate and private key files. The options
you have are similar to the options for specifying custom cluster CAs during
cluster creation. When you run the bmctl update credentials
certificate-authorities rotate command, you have the following options:
Specify the paths for both the custom CA certificate files and the private
key files.
Specify the paths for the custom CA private key files only. The
corresponding CA certificate file must be in the same directory, have the
same name as the key file, and have a .crt file extension.
Reuse a CA certificate-key pair by specifying the same certificate and key
paths for more than one cluster CA.
Omit the arguments for the custom CA paths. If you don't specify custom CA
paths when you rotate CAs, Google Distributed Cloud creates and uses the
standard cluster CA.
Example 1: Specify CA certificate and private key paths
bmctl update credentials certificate-authorities rotate \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG \
--cluster-ca-cert-path = CLUSTER_CA_CERT_PATH \
--cluster-ca-private-key-path = CLUSTER_CA_KEY_PATH \
--etcd-ca-cert-path = ETCD_CA_CERT_PATH \
--etcd-ca-private-key-path = ETCD_CA_KEY_PATH \
--front-proxy-ca-cert-path = FRONT_PROXY_CA_CERT_PATH \
--front-proxy-ca-private-key-path = FRONT_PROXY_CA_KEY_PATH
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster for which you want
to rotate CAs.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path to the admin cluster
kubeconfig file. For self-managing clusters, this file is the cluster's
kubeconfig file.
CLUSTER_CA_CERT_PATH : the path of the cluster CA
certificate file.
CLUSTER_CA_KEY_PATH : the path of the cluster CA private
key file.
ETCD_CA_CERT_PATH : the path of the etcd CA certificate
file.
ETCD_CA_KEY_PATH : the path of the etcd CA private key
file.
FRONT_PROXY_CA_CERT_PATH : the path of the front-proxy
certificate file.
FRONT_PROXY_CA_KEY_PATH : the path of the front-proxy
private key file.
Example 2: Specify private key paths only
bmctl update credentials certificate-authorities rotate \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG \
--cluster-ca-private-key-path = CLUSTER_CA_KEY_PATH \
--etcd-ca-private-key-path = ETCD_CA_KEY_PATH \
--front-proxy-ca-private-key-path = FRONT_PROXY_CA_KEY_PATH
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster for which you want
to rotate CAs.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path to the admin cluster
kubeconfig file. For self-managing clusters, this file is the cluster's
kubeconfig file.
CLUSTER_CA_KEY_PATH : the path of the cluster CA private
key file.
ETCD_CA_KEY_PATH : the path of the etcd CA private key
file.
FRONT_PROXY_CA_KEY_PATH : the path of the front-proxy
private key file.
Intermediate CAs
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Version 1.29 clusters support the use of intermediate CAs as a
Preview capability. This capability isn't at
the same launch stage for all supported product versions:
1.29: Preview
1.28: Not available
1.16: Not available
Similar to the root CA requirement for custom CAs, to use intermediate CAs you
must prepare three sets of CAs. Each CA consists of a CA certificate file and
its corresponding private key file. You provide a CA certificate and key file
pair for each of the following required cluster CAs:
etcd CA
cluster CA
front-proxy CA
As with root CAs, you can provide a unique certificate-key pair for each CA or
you can reuse a certificate-key pair for more than one of the CAs by specifying
the same file paths in the CA configuration.
When you use intermediate CAs, the CA certificate file should contain the whole
certificate chain, which includes certificates from the intermediate CAs up to
the root CA. The certificates are listed in reverse order of how they were
signed, with the last intermediate CA certificate at the top and the root CA
certificate at the bottom.
In the following example (starting with the root CA at the bottom), the order
indicates the following:
Root CA signed the Intermediate-A CA certificate
Intermediate-A CA signed the Intermediate-B CA certificate
The chain continues up to the final Intermediate-Y CA certificate, which was
signed by the Intermediate-X CA
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<Intermediate-Y CA CERT CONTENT>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<Intermediate-X CA CERT CONTENT>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<Intermediate-B CA CERT CONTENT>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<Intermediate-A CA CERT CONTENT>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<ROOT CA CERT CONTENT>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
To continue with this example, the private key associated with the
Intermediate-Y CA certificate should be passed along with the CA certificate
chains in the same way as in a custom CA.
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
<Intermediate-Y PRIVATE KEY CONTENT>
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
To check if the cluster is using the intermediate CA, inspect the certificate
count in the cluster's CA secret:
kubectl get secret CLUSTER_NAME -ca \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
-n cluster- CLUSTER_NAME \
-o jsonpath = '{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 --decode | grep "BEGIN CERTIFICATE" | wc -l
