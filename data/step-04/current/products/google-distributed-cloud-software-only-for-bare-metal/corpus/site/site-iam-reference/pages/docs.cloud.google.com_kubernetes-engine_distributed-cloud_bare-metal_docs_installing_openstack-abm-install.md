Deploy a cluster on OpenStack
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide walks you through a sample installation of Google Distributed Cloud
(software only) on bare metal on OpenStack virtual machines (VMs) with supported
operating systems. The deployment uses a script to simplify installation of a
hybrid cluster in OpenStack VMs. The guide also shows you one way to enable load
balancing as a Service (LBaaS). You can use the OpenStack LBaaS and the
Kubernetes OpenStack Cloud Provider with Google Distributed Cloud to expose the
Kubernetes services outside of the OpenStack cluster.
Google Distributed Cloud doesn't provision the OpenStack VMs automatically, and
provisioning the VMs is outside the scope of this guide. To learn the VM
requirements and review an example deployment, see the
Terraform example to create OpenStack VMs .
The guide consists of the following sections:
Deploy Google Distributed Cloud
Configure the OpenStack Cloud Provider for Kubernetes
in the installed cluster to integrate with the Octavia load balancers
Validate the OpenStack Cloud Provider for Kubernetes integration
This guide uses OpenStack
Ussuri ,
but Google Distributed Cloud doesn't have a requirement for specific versions of
OpenStack. The guide uses OpenStack VMs to provide you with a two-node
proof of concept environment running on OpenStack. For production installation
requirements for Google Distributed Cloud, see the
installation prerequisites .
Example deployment
This guide provides you with an example deployment of a bare metal cluster on
OpenStack that integrates with OpenStack LBaaS. You must understand and adjust
the commands and configuration values to suit your OpenStack environment.
The following diagram shows the resulting deployment:
Prerequisites
OpenStack Ussuri with LBaaS v2 deployed and functional
Service account for downloading the bmctl tool
Configure your OpenStack VMs and network as shown in the example deployment.
To provision a similar setup in your OpenStack environment, you have the
following options:
Use this
Terraform script
to provision the resources automatically.
Provision the resources manually.
The following OpenStack VMs must be ready and available through SSH:
Name
IP address
Purpose
abm-ws
10.200.0.10 (private IP)
floating_ip (public IP)
Acts as the admin workstation : It's used to deploy
Google Distributed Cloud to the other machines.
abm-cp1
10.200.0.11
Cluster control plane: This host runs the
Kubernetes control plane and load balancer.
abm-w1
10.200.0.12
Cluster worker node:
This host runs the Kubernetes workloads.
Deploy Google Distributed Cloud
This section shows you how to complete the following tasks:
Install the tools you need on the abm-ws admin workstation VM.
Configure the project ID and service account needed to securely complete
the deployment
Create a cluster configuration file
Create a cluster
Warning: The commands in this guide are based on the assumption that the
environment for Google Distributed Cloud in OpenStack was set up using the supplied
Terraform script .
The names (for example, VM name, network name, root user name) used in the
commands match what is used by the Terraform script. If you configured the
OpenStack environment manually, adjust the commands according to your setup.
Install the tools you need
Fetch the public floating IP address of the abm-ws VM:
export OPENSTACK_IPS = $( openstack floating ip list --tags = abm_ws_floatingip -f json )
export FLOATING_IP = $( jq -c '.[]."Floating IP Address"' <<< $OPENSTACK_IPS | tr -d '"' )
Ensure you can use SSH to connect securely into the abm-ws VM and sign in
as a root user. The root user configured by the
Terraform scripts
is abm .
ssh ubuntu@ $FLOATING_IP
sudo -u abm -i
Note: If you have public key authentication configured for your VM use the
"-o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i <PATH_TO_KEY>" flags with the SSH command.
Verify that you can use SSH to connect to the other nodes:
ssh abm@10.200.0.11 'echo SSH to $HOSTNAME succeeded'
ssh abm@10.200.0.12 'echo SSH to $HOSTNAME succeeded'
The expected responses for the preceding commands are:
SSH to abm-cp1 succeeded
SSH to abm-w1 succeeded
Download the kubectl command line utility on the abm-ws VM.
curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/ $( curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt ) /bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/sbin/
Install Docker on the abm-ws VM:
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker abm
newgrp docker
Configure the Google Cloud project and service account
Obtain Google Cloud CLI access credentials for your user account.
These credentials are used with subsequent gcloud commands.
gcloud auth login
Make sure the Google Cloud CLI is configured to use the Google Cloud project in
which you want your cluster to be registered.
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Set the
Application Default Credentials (ADC)
for your user account in the admin workstation. This will be used when the
bmctl tool is used for cluster creation.
gcloud auth application-default login
Create the bm-gcr service account. You use this service account to
authenticate from the cluster.
gcloud iam service-accounts create bm-gcr
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create bm-gcr.json \
--iam-account = bm-gcr@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
Enable the necessary APIs:
gcloud services enable \
anthos.googleapis.com \
anthosaudit.googleapis.com \
anthosgke.googleapis.com \
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
connectgateway.googleapis.com \
container.googleapis.com \
gkeconnect.googleapis.com \
gkehub.googleapis.com \
gkeonprem.googleapis.com \
iam.googleapis.com \
logging.googleapis.com \
monitoring.googleapis.com \
opsconfigmonitoring.googleapis.com \
serviceusage.googleapis.com \
stackdriver.googleapis.com \
storage.googleapis.com
Give additional permissions to the bm-gcr service account. Adding the
permissions means you don't need to create multiple service accounts for
individual services.

Create a cluster configuration file
Download the bmctl command line utility.
mkdir baremetal && cd baremetal
gcloud storage cp gs://anthos-baremetal-release/bmctl/1.34.200-gke.68/linux-amd64/bmctl .
chmod a+x bmctl
sudo mv bmctl /usr/local/sbin/
Create a cluster configuration file for your cluster:
bmctl create config -c CLUSTER_NAME
Update the configuration file for use with OpenStack:
cat > bmctl-workspace/ CLUSTER_NAME / CLUSTER_NAME .yaml << EOB

Create the cluster
Create the cluster:
bmctl create cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME
Running the bmctl command starts setting up a new hybrid cluster. This
includes doing preflight checks on the nodes, creating the admin and user
clusters and also registering the cluster with Google Cloud using
Connect Agent .
The whole setup can take up to 15 minutes. You see the following output as the
cluster is being created:

Verify and interact with the cluster
You can find your cluster kubeconfig file on the abm-ws VM inside the
bmctl-workspace directory. To verify your deployment, complete the following
steps:
Set the KUBECONFIG environment variable with the path to the cluster
configuration file to run kubectl commands on the cluster:
export KUBECONFIG = $HOME /bmctl-workspace/ CLUSTER_NAME / CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig
kubectl get nodes
You should see the nodes of the cluster printed, similar to the following
output:
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
abm-cp1 Ready control-plane,master 5m24s v1.20.5-gke.1301
abm-w1 Ready <none> 2m17s v1.20.5-gke.1301
Sign in to your cluster from Google Cloud console
To observe your workloads in the Google Cloud console, you must sign in to the
cluster. For instructions and more information about signing in to your cluster,
see
Work with clusters from the Google Cloud console .
Clean up
You can clean up the cluster by issuing the following command in your admin
workstation ( abm-ws ) VM:
Note: If you want to install the OpenStack Cloud Provider on the newly created
cluster, follow the Configure the OpenStack Cloud Provider for
Kubernetes guide before you
clean up.
export KUBECONFIG = $HOME /bmctl-workspace/ CLUSTER_NAME / CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig
bmctl reset --cluster CLUSTER_NAME
What's next?
To install the OpenStack Cloud Provider on the newly created cluster, follow
the Configure the OpenStack Cloud Provider for Kubernetes
guide.
