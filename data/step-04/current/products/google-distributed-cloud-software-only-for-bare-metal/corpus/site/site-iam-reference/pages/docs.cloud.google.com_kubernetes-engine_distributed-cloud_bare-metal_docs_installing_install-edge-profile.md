This tutorial introduces a ready-to-use solution that uses
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on bare metal and
Config Sync
to deploy Kubernetes clusters on the edge at scale. This tutorial is for
platform operators and developers. Before reading this document, ensure that
you're familiar with the
following technologies and concepts:
Ansible playbooks .
Edge deployments and their challenges.
How to work with a Google Cloud project.
Deploying a containerized web application .
gcloud and kubectl command-line interfaces.
In this tutorial you use Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs) to emulate
nodes deployed on the edge, and a sample point-of-sale application as the edge
workload. Google Distributed Cloud software-only and Config Sync provide
centralized management and control for your edge cluster. Config Sync
dynamically pulls new configs from GitHub and applies these policies and configs
to your clusters.
Edge deployment architecture
A retail edge deployment is a good way to illustrate the architecture that's
used in a typical bare metal cluster deployment.
A physical retail store is the closest point of interaction between an
enterprise business unit and the consumer. Software systems inside stores must
run their workloads, receive timely updates, and report critical metrics in
isolation from the enterprise's central management system. Furthermore, these
software systems need to be designed so that they can be expanded to more store
locations in the future. While any bare metal cluster deployment satisfies all
these requirements for store software systems, the
edge profile
enables an important use case: deployments in environments with limited
hardware resources , like a retail store front.
The following diagram shows a bare metal cluster deployment that uses the edge
profile in a retail store:
The preceding diagram shows a typical physical retail store. The store has smart
devices like card readers, point-of-sale machines, cameras, and printers. The
store also has three physical computing hardware devices (labeled Node 1 ,
Node 2 and Node 3 ). All these devices are connected to a central network
switch. Thus, the three computing devices are connected to each other through a
Layer 2 network. The computing devices networked together make up the bare metal
infrastructure. Google Distributed Cloud software is running inside each of the
three computing devices. These devices also have their own disk storage and are
configured for data replication between them for high availability.
The diagram also shows the following key components that are part of a bare
metal cluster deployment:
The component marked as MetalLB is the
bundled load balancer .
The Config Sync component enables synchronizing the state of the cluster
against source repositories. It is a highly recommended optional add-on that
requires separate installation and configuration. For more information on
how to set up Config Sync and the different nomenclature, see the
Config Sync documentation
The root repository and namespace repository shown at the top of the
diagram outside the store location represent two source repositories.
Changes to the cluster are pushed to these central source repositories.
Cluster deployments in various edge locations pull updates from the source
repositories. This behavior is represented by the arrows connecting the two
repositories in the diagram to the Config Sync components inside the
cluster running in the devices.
Another key component that's depicted as part of the cluster is the
VM Runtime on GDC. VM Runtime on GDC enables running
existing VM-based workloads inside the cluster without the need for
containerization. The
VM Runtime on GDC documentation
explains how to enable it and deploy your VM workloads into the cluster.
The component marked as Application denotes software deployed into the
cluster by the retail store. The point of sale application seen in the
kiosks of a retail store could be one example of such an application.
The boxes at the bottom of the diagram represent the many devices (like kiosks,
tablets, or cameras) inside a retail store, all of which are connected to a
central network switch. The local networking inside the store enables the
applications running inside the cluster to reach these devices.
In the next section, you see the emulation of this retail store deployment in
Google Cloud using Compute Engine VMs. This emulation is what you use
in the tutorial that follows to experiment with a bare metal cluster.
Emulated edge deployment in Google Cloud
The following diagram is a depiction of everything that you set up in
Google Cloud in this tutorial. This diagram correlates to the retail store
diagram from the preceding section. This deployment represents an emulated edge
location in which the point of sale application is deployed. The architecture
also shows a point of sale sample application workload that you use in
this tutorial. You access the point of sale application inside the cluster by
using a web browser as a kiosk.
The three Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs) in the preceding diagram
represent the physical hardware (or nodes) in a typical edge location. This
hardware would be connected together with network switches to make up the bare
metal infrastructure. In our emulated environment in Google Cloud,
these VMs are connected to each other through the default
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
network in the Google Cloud project.
In a typical bare metal cluster installation you can configure your own load
balancers . However, for this tutorial you
don't set up an external load balancer. Instead you use the bundled MetalLB load
balancer. The bundled MetalLB load balancer requires Layer 2 network
connectivity between the nodes. Thus, Layer 2 connectivity between the
Compute Engine VMs is enabled by creating a
VxLAN
overlay network on top of the default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.
Within the rectangle labeled "L2 overlay network (VxLAN)" the software
components running inside the three Compute Engine VMs are shown. This VxLAN
rectangle includes the cluster deploymnt, which contains a Kubernetes namespace
inside the cluster. All the components inside this Kubernetes namespace make up
the point of sale application that is deployed into the cluster. The point of
sale application has three microservices: API Server, Inventory, and Payments.
All these components together represent one "application" shown in the earlier
Edge rollout architecture diagram.
The cluster's bundled MetalLB load balancer
can't be directly reached from outside the VMs. The diagram shows an
NGINX reverse proxy
being configured to run inside the VMs to route traffic coming into the
Compute Engine VMs to the load balancer. This is only a workaround for the
purposes of this tutorial where the edge nodes are emulated using Google Cloud
Compute Engine VMs. In a real edge location this can be done with proper
network configuration.
Objectives
Use Compute Engine VMs to emulate a bare metal infrastructure that runs in an edge location.
Use Google Distributed Cloud to create a cluster in the emulated edge infrastructure.
Connect and register the cluster with Google Cloud.
Deploy a sample point-of-sale application workload on the cluster.
Use the Google Cloud console to verify and monitor the point-of-sale application
that operates on the edge location.
Use Config Sync
to update the point-of-sale application that runs on the cluster.
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or
create a Google Cloud project .
Note: If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this
procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After
you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources
associated with the project.
Go to project select
Make sure that billing is enabled for your Cloud project. Learn how to
check if billing is enabled on a project .
Install
and initialize
the Google Cloud CLI.
Fork and clone the anthos-samples repository
All the scripts used in this tutorial are stored in the anthos-samples
repository. The folder structure under
/anthos-bm-edge-deployment/acm-config-sink
is organized according to what is expected by Config Sync.
Clone this repository to your own GitHub account before you continue with the
following steps.
If you don't have one already, create an account on GitHub .
Create a personal access token
to use in the Config Sync configuration. This is required for the
Config Sync components in the cluster to authenticate with your
GitHub account when trying to synchronize new changes.
Select the public_repo scope only.
Save the access token you created in a safe place to use later.
Fork the anthos-samples repository to your own GitHub account:
Go to the anthos-samples repository .
Click the Fork icon on the top-right corner of the page.
Click the GitHub user account you want to fork the repository to. You
are automatically redirected to the page with your forked version of the
anthos-samples repository.
Open a terminal in your local environment.
Clone the forked repository by running the following command, where
GITHUB_USERNAME is the username for your GitHub
account:
git clone https://github.com/ GITHUB_USERNAME /anthos-samples
cd anthos-samples/anthos-bm-edge-deployment
Note: Both the source repository for this solution and your fork of that
repository are public repositories. This document shows the use of an access
token to mimic an actual use case with a private repository.
Set up the workstation environment
To complete the edge deployment described in this document, you need one
workstation with access to the Internet and the following tools installed:
Docker
envsubst command-line interface tool
(usually pre-installed on Linux and other Unix-like OSes)
Run all of the commands in the tutorial on the workstation you configure in this section.
On your workstation, initialize the environment variables in a new shell instance:
export PROJECT_ID = " PROJECT_ID "
export REGION = "us-central1"
export ZONE = "us-central1-a"
# port on the admin Compute Engine instance you use to set up an nginx proxy
# this allows to reach the workloads inside the cluster via the VM IP
export PROXY_PORT = "8082"
# should be a multiple of 3 since N/3 clusters are created with each having 3 nodes
export GCE_COUNT = "3"
# url to the fork of: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-samples
export ROOT_REPO_URL = "https://github.com/ GITHUB_USERNAME /anthos-samples"
# this is the username used to authenticate to your fork of this repository
export SCM_TOKEN_USER = " GITHUB_USERNAME "
# access token created in the earlier step
export SCM_TOKEN_TOKEN = " ACCESS_TOKEN "
Replace the following values:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
GITHUB_USERNAME : your GitHub username.
ACCESS_TOKEN : the personal access token you created for your GitHub repository.
Keep the default values for the other environment variables. They are
explained in the sections that follow.
On your workstation, initialize Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud config set project " ${ PROJECT_ID } "
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud config set compute/region " ${ REGION } "
gcloud config set compute/zone " ${ ZONE } "
Note: This step can take up to 90 seconds to complete.
On your workstation, create the Google Cloud service account for the
Compute Engine instances. This script creates the JSON key file for the
new service account at <REPO_ROOT>/anthos-bm-edge-deployment/build-artifacts/consumer-edge-gsa.json .
It also sets up the Cloud Key Management Service
key ring and key for SSH private key encryption.
./scripts/create-primary-gsa.sh
The following sample is only a portion of the script. To see the entire
script, click View on GitHub .
# ...
EXISTS = $( gcloud iam service-accounts list \
--filter = "email= ${ GSA_EMAIL } " \
--format = "value(name, disabled)" \
--project = " ${ PROJECT_ID } " )
if [[ -z " ${ EXISTS } " ]] ; then
echo "GSA [ ${ GSA_EMAIL } ]does not exist, creating it"
# GSA does NOT exist, create
gcloud iam service-accounts create ${ GSA_NAME } \
--description = "GSA used on each Target machine to make gcloud commands" \
--display-name = "target-machine-gsa" \
--project " ${ PROJECT_ID } "
else
if [[ " ${ EXISTS } " = ~ .* "disabled" .* ]] ; then
# Found GSA is disabled, enable
gcloud iam service-accounts enable " ${ GSA_EMAIL } " --project " ${ PROJECT_ID } "
fi
# otherwise, no need to do anything
fi
# ...
Provision the Compute Engine instances
In this section, you create the Compute Engine VMs where
Google Distributed Cloud software-only will be installed. You also verify
connectivity to these VMs before proceeding to the install section.
On your workstation, create SSH keys that are used for communication between
the Compute Engine instances:
ssh-keygen -f ./build-artifacts/consumer-edge-machine
Encrypt the SSH private key using Cloud Key Management Service:
gcloud kms encrypt \
--key gdc-ssh-key \
--keyring gdc-ce-keyring \
--location global \
--plaintext-file build-artifacts/consumer-edge-machine \
--ciphertext-file build-artifacts/consumer-edge-machine.encrypted
Generate the environment configuration file .envrc and source it. After
created inspect the .envrc file to ensure that the environment variables
have been replaced with the correct values.
envsubst < templates/envrc-template.sh > .envrc
source .envrc
The following is an example of an .envrc file generated by replacing the
environment variables in the templates/envrc-template.sh file. Notice that
the lines that were updated are highlighted:
# GSA Key used for provisioning (result of running ./scripts/create-primary-gsa.sh)
LOCAL_GSA_FILE =$ ( pwd ) / build - artifacts / consumer - edge - gsa . json
export LOCAL_GSA_FILE
# GCP Project ID
export PROJECT_ID = "abm-edge-project"
# Bucket to store cluster snapshot information
export SNAPSHOT_GCS = "abm-edge-project-cluster-snapshots"
# GCP Project Region (Adjust as desired)
export REGION = "us-central1"
# GCP Project Zone (Adjust as desired)
export ZONE = "us-central1-a"
# Gitlab Personal Access Token credentials (generated in Quick Start step 2)
export SCM_TOKEN_USER = "LarryPage"
export SCM_TOKEN_TOKEN = "oo901Sp-FHuzmz__dgl0393atkf69c8L"
# Default Root Repo setup for multiple locations
export ROOT_REPO_URL = "https://github.com/LarryPage/anthos-samples"
export ROOT_REPO_BRANCH = "main"
export ROOT_REPO_DIR = "/anthos-bm-edge-deployment/acm-config-sink"
# OIDC Configuration (off by default)
export OIDC_CLIENT_ID = "" # Optional, requires GCP API setup work
export OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET = "" # Optional
export OIDC_USER = "" # Optional
export OIDC_ENABLED = "false" # Flip to true IF implementing OIDC on cluster
Create Compute Engine instances:
./scripts/cloud/create-cloud-gce-baseline.sh -c " $GCE_COUNT " | \
tee ./build-artifacts/gce-info
Install a bare metal cluster with Ansible
The script used in this guide creates clusters in groups of three
Compute Engine instances. The number of clusters created is controlled by
the GCE_COUNT environment variable. For example, you set the environment
variable GCE_COUNT to 6 to create two clusters with 3 VM instances each.
By default the GCE_COUNT environment variable is set to 3 . Thus, in this
guide one cluster with 3 Compute Engine instances will be created. The VM
instances are named with a prefix cnuc- followed by a number. The first VM
instance of each cluster acts as the admin workstation from which the
installation is triggered. The cluster is also given the same name as the admin
workstation VM (for example, cnuc-1 , cnuc-4 , cnuc-7 ).
The Ansible playbook does the following:
Configures the Compute Engine instances with the necessary tools, such
as docker , bmctl , gcloud , and nomos .
Installs a bare metal cluster in the configured Compute Engine instances.
Creates a standalone cluster called cnuc-1 .
Registers the cnuc-1 cluster with Google Cloud.
Installs Config Sync into the cnuc-1 cluster.
Configures Config Sync to sync with the cluster configurations located
at anthos-bm-edge-deployment/acm-config-sink in your forked repository.
Generates the Login token for the cluster.
Complete the following steps to set up and start the installation process:
On your workstation, create the Docker image used for the installation. This
image has all the tools required for the installation process, such as
Ansible, Python, and Google Cloud CLI.
gcloud builds submit --config docker-build/cloudbuild.yaml docker-build/
When the build runs successfully, it produces an output like the following:
...
latest: digest: sha256:99ded20d221a0b2bcd8edf3372c8b1f85d6c1737988b240dd28ea1291f8b151a size: 4498

Generate the Ansible inventory file from template:
envsubst < templates/inventory-cloud-example.yaml > inventory/gcp.yaml
Run the installation script that starts a Docker container from the image
built previously. The script internally uses Docker to spawn the container
with a volume mount to the current working directory. Upon successful
completion of this script you must be inside the Docker container that was
created. You trigger the Ansible installation from inside this container.
./install.sh
When the script runs successfully, it produces an output like the following:
...
Check the values above and if correct, do you want to proceed? ( y/N ) : y
Starting the installation
Pulling docker install image...
==============================
Starting the docker container. You will need to run the following 2 commands ( cut-copy-paste )
==============================
1 : ./scripts/health-check.sh
2 : ansible-playbook all-full-install.yaml -i inventory
3 : Type 'exit' to exit the Docker shell after installation
==============================
Thank you for using the quick helper script!
( you are now inside the Docker shell )
From inside the Docker container, verify access to the Compute Engine
instances:
./scripts/health-check.sh
When the script runs successfully, it produces an output like the following:
...
cnuc-2 | SUCCESS = > { "ansible_facts" : { "discovered_interpreter_python" : "/usr/bin/python3" } , "changed" : false, "ping" : "pong" }
cnuc-3 | SUCCESS = > { "ansible_facts" : { "discovered_interpreter_python" : "/usr/bin/python3" } , "changed" : false, "ping" : "pong" }
cnuc-1 | SUCCESS = > { "ansible_facts" : { "discovered_interpreter_python" : "/usr/bin/python3" } , "changed" : false, "ping" : "pong" }
From inside the Docker container, run the Ansible playbook for installing
a bare metal cluster on Compute Engine instances:
Upon completion you will see the Login Token for the cluster
printed on screen.
ansible-playbook all-full-install.yaml -i inventory | tee ./build-artifacts/ansible-run.log
When the install runs successfully, it produces an output like the following:

Note: This step can take up to 35 minutes to complete for a setup with
$GCE_COUNT=3 .
Sign in to the cluster in the Google Cloud console
After the Ansible playbook runs to completion, a standalone cluster is installed
inside the Compute Engine VMs. This cluster is also registered to
Google Cloud, using the Connect Agent. However, to see details about
this cluster you have to log into the cluster from the Google Cloud console.
To login to the cluster complete the following steps:
Copy the token from the output of the Ansible playbook in the previous
section.
Note: If you don't have access to the console output anymore, check the log
file at ./build-artifacts/ansible-run.log to get your token. You may also
run the following ansible playbook to fetch the token again:
ansible-playbook all-get-login-tokens.yaml -i inventory
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Kubernetes clusters page and
use the copied token to sign in to the cnuc-1 cluster.
Go to the Kubernetes clusters page
In the list of clusters, click
more_vert Actions
next to the cnuc-1 cluster, and then click Log in .
Select Token and paste in the copied token.
Click Login .
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Config page under the Features section.
Go to Config
On the Packages tab, check the Sync status column in the cluster table.
Verify that the status is Synced . A status of Synced indicates that
Config Sync
has successfully synchronized your GitHub configs with your deployed
cluster, cnuc-1 .
Configure a proxy for external traffic
The cluster installed in the previous steps uses a bundled load balancer called
MetalLB . This load balancer service is
accessible only through a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) IP address. To route
traffic coming in through its external IP to the bundled load balancer, set up a
reverse proxy service in the admin host ( cnuc-1 ). This reverse proxy service
lets you reach the API Server of the point of sale application through the
external IP of the admin host ( cnuc-1 ).
The installation scripts in the earlier steps installed
NGINX in the admin hosts along with a sample
configuration file. Update this file to use the IP address of the load balancer
service and restart NGINX.
On your workstation, use SSH to log into the admin workstation:
ssh -F ./build-artifacts/ssh-config abm-admin@cnuc-1
From inside the admin workstation, set up NGINX reverse proxy to route
traffic to the API Server Load balancer service. Get the IP address of the
Load balancer type Kubernetes service:
ABM_INTERNAL_IP = $( kubectl get services api-server-lb -n pos | awk '{print $4}' | tail -n 1 )
Update the template configuration file with the fetched IP address:
sudo sh -c "sed 's/<K8_LB_IP>/ ${ ABM_INTERNAL_IP } /g' \
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.template > /etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
Restart NGINX to make sure that the new configuration is applied:
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Check and verify the status of the NGINX server reports "active
(running)":
sudo systemctl status nginx
When NGINX is running successfully, it produces an output like the following
example:
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
Loaded: loaded ( /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service ; enabled ; vendor preset: enabled )

Exit from the SSH session into the admin workstation:
exit
Exit from the shell session into the Docker container. Upon exiting the
admin instance, you are still inside the Docker container used for the
installation:
exit
Access the point of sale application
With the external proxy setup you are able to access the application running
inside the cluster. To access the sample point of sale application,
complete the following steps.
On your workstation, get the external IP address of the admin
Compute Engine instance and access the UI of the point of sale application:
EXTERNAL_IP = $( gcloud compute instances list \
--project ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--filter = "name:cnuc-1" \
--format = "get(networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP)" )
echo "Point the browser to: ${ EXTERNAL_IP } : ${ PROXY_PORT } "
When the scripts run successfully, they produce output like the following:
Point the browser to: 34 .134.194.84:8082
Open your web browser and navigate to the IP address shown in the output of
the previous command. You can access and test the sample point of sale
application, as shown in the following example screenshot:
Use Config Sync to update the API Server
The sample application can be upgraded to a newer version by updating the
configuration files in the root repository. Config Sync detects
the updates and automatically makes the changes to your cluster. In this example
the root repository is the anthos-samples repository that you cloned at the
beginning of this guide. To see how the sample point of sale application can go
through an upgrade deployment to a newer version, complete the following steps.
On your workstation, update the image field to change the API Server
version from v1 to v2 . The YAML configuration for the deployment is in the
file at anthos-bm-edge-deployment/acm-config-sink/namespaces/pos/api-server.yaml .
containers :
- name : api-server
image : us-docker.pkg.dev/anthos-dpe-abm-edge-pos/abm-edge-pos-images/api-server:v1
Add, commit, and push the changes to your forked repository:
git add acm-config-sink/namespaces/pos/api-server.yaml
git commit -m "chore: updated api-server version to v2"
git push
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Config Sync page to check
the Config spec status . Verify that the status is Synced .
Go to the Config Sync page
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Kubernetes Engine Workloads
page to verify that the Deployment is updated.
Go to the Kubernetes Engine Workloads page
When the status of the Deployment is OK , point your browser to the
IP address from the previous section to view the point of sale application.
Note that the version in the title shows "V2", indicating that your
application change was deployed, as shown in the following example
screenshot:
You might have to do a hard refresh of the browser tab to see the changes.
Clean up
To avoid unnecessary Google Cloud charges, delete the resources used for
this guide when you are done with it. You can either delete these
resources manually, or delete your Google Cloud project, which also gets rid
of all resources. In addition, you might also want to clean up the changes made
in your local workstation:
Local workstation
The following files have to be updated to clear changes made by the
installation scripts.
Remove the Compute Engine VM IP addresses added to the /etc/hosts file.
Remove the SSH configuration for cnuc-* in the ~/.ssh/config file.
Remove the Compute Engine VM fingerprints from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.
Delete Project
If you created a dedicated project for this procedure, delete the Google Cloud project
from the Google Cloud console.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Manual
If you used an existing project for this procedure, do the following:
Unregister all Kubernetes clusters with a name prefixed by cnuc- .

What's next?
You can expand on this guide by adding another edge location. Setting the
GCE_COUNT environment variable to 6 and re-running the same steps from
the preceding sections creates three new Compute Engine instances
( cnuc-4 , cnuc-5 , cnuc-6 ) and a new standalone cluster called cnuc-4 .
You can also try updating the cluster configurations
in your forked repository to selectively apply different versions of the
point of sale application to the two clusters, cnuc-1 and cnuc-4 , using
ClusterSelectors .
For details about the individual steps in this guide, the scripts involved, see
the anthos-samples
repository.
