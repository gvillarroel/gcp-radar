Configure bundled load balancing with MetalLB
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to configure bundled load balancing with MetalLB for
Google Distributed Cloud. MetalLB load balancers run on either a dedicated pool of
worker nodes or on the same nodes as the control plane.
See Overview of load balancers for
examples of load-balancing topologies available in Google Distributed Cloud.
Requirements
All load balancer nodes must be in the same Layer 2 subnet.
All VIPs must be in the load balancer nodes subnet and be routable through the
subnet's gateway.
The gateway of the load balancer subnet must listen to gratuitous ARP messages
and forward ARP packets to the load balancer nodes.
Configuration fields
Edit the cluster.spec.loadBalancer section of the cluster configuration file
to configure bundled load balancing. For information about cluster
configuration files and examples of valid configurations, see one of the
following pages:
Create admin clusters
Create user clusters
Create hybrid clusters
Create standalone clusters
loadBalancer.mode
This value must be bundled to enable bundled load balancing.
loadBalancer.ports.controlPlaneLBPort
This value specifies the destination port to be used for traffic sent to the
Kubernetes control plane (the Kubernetes API servers).
loadBalancer.vips.controlPlaneVIP
This value specifies the destination IP address to be used for traffic sent to
the Kubernetes control plane (the Kubernetes API servers). This IP address must
be in the same Layer 2 subnet as the nodes in the cluster. Don't list this
address in the address pools section of the configuration
file.
loadBalancer.vips.ingressVIP
This value specifies the IP address to be used for Services behind the load
balancer for ingress traffic. This field is not allowed in admin
cluster
configuration files. This address must be listed in the address
pools section of the configuration.
loadBalancer.addressPools
This section of the configuration contains one or more address pools. Each
address pool specifies a list of IP address ranges. When you create a
Service of type LoadBalancer ,
the external IP addresses for the Service are chosen from these ranges.
Note: Starting with Google Distributed Cloud version 1.16.0, you can update an
existing load balancer address pool at any time to change the following two
fields: avoidBuggyIPs and manualAssign .
Address pools are specified in the following format:
- name : POOL_NAME
avoidBuggyIPs : BOOLEAN
manualAssign : BOOLEAN
addresses :
- IP_RANGE
- IP_RANGE2
name : The name of the address pool, pool-name , for your own
organizational purposes. This field is immutable.
avoidBuggyIPs : (Optional) true or false . If true , the
pool omits IP addresses ending in .0 and .255 . Some network hardware drops
traffic to these special addresses. You can omit this field, its default value
is false . This field is mutable.
manualAssign : (Optional) true or false . If true ,
addresses in this pool are not automatically assigned to Kubernetes Services.
If true , an IP address in this pool is used only when it is specified
explicitly by a service. You can omit this field, its default value is
false . This field is mutable.
addresses A list of one or more nonoverlapping IP address ranges.
ip-range can be specified in either CIDR notation (like
198.51.100.0/24 ) or range notation (like 198.51.100.0-198.51.100.10 , with
no spaces around the dash). This field is immutable.
The IP address ranges in the addresses list must not overlap and must be in
the same subnet as the nodes running load balancers.
loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec
This section of the configuration specifies a list of nodes to run load
balancers on. Load balancer nodes can run regular workloads by default; there is
no special taint on those nodes. Although nodes in the load balancer node pool
can run workloads, they're separate from the nodes in the worker node pools. You
can't include a given cluster node in more than one node pool. Overlapping node
IP addresses between node pools block cluster creation and other cluster
operations.
If you want to prevent workloads from running on a node in the load balancer
node pool, add the following taint to the node:
node-role.kubernetes.io/load-balancer:NoSchedule
Google Distributed Cloud adds tolerations for this taint to the pods that are required
for load balancing.
The following example shows a load balancing node pool with two nodes. The first
node has a standard IP address nodePoolSpec.nodes.address ('1.2.3.4') and a
Kubernetes IP address nodePoolSpec.nodes.k8sIP ( 10.0.0.32 ). When you specify
the optional k8sIP address for a node, it's dedicated to handling data traffic
for the node, such as requests and responses for the Kubernetes API, the
kubelet, and workloads. In this case, the standard IP address
nodePoolSpec.nodes.address is used for SSH connections to the node for
administrative cluster operations. If you don't specify a k8sIP address, the
standard node IP address handles all traffic for the node.
nodePoolSpec :
nodes :
- address : 1.2.3.4
k8sIP : 10.0.0.32
- address : 10.0.0.33
By default, all nodes in the load balancer node pool must be in the same Layer 2
subnet as the load balancer VIPs configured in the
loadBalancer.addressPools section of the configuration file.
However, if you specify a Kubernetes IP address k8sIP for a node, only that
address needs to be in the same Layer 2 subnet as the other load balancer VIPs.
If nodePoolSpec isn't set, the bundled load balancers run on the control
plane nodes. We recommend you run load balancers on separate node pools if
possible.
Control plane load balancing
The control plane load balancer serves the control plane virtual IP address
(VIP). Google Distributed Cloud runs Keepalived and HAProxy as Kubernetes static pods on
the load-balancer nodes to announce the control plane VIP. Keepalived uses the
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) on the load balancer nodes for high
availability.
Data plane load balancing
Note: MetalLB in BGP mode isn't supported. For load balancing in BGP mode, see
Configure bundled load balancers with BGP .
The data plane load balancer is for all Kubernetes Services of type
LoadBalancer .
Google Distributed Cloud uses MetalLB
running in Layer 2 mode for data plane load balancing. Data plane load balancing
can only be configured through Google Distributed Cloud, don't modify the MetalLB
ConfigMap directly. You can use all MetalLB features including
IP address sharing across Services .
See the MetalLB documentation for feature information.
MetalLB runs a speaker Pod on each node using a daemonset, using
memberlist
for high availability. There is a MetalLB dedicated load balancer node for each
Kubernetes Service, rather than one for the entire cluster. This way traffic is
distributed across load balancer nodes if there are multiple Services.
The data plane load balancers can run on either the control plane nodes
or on a subset of worker nodes. Bundling data plane load balancers on the
control plane nodes increases utilization of the control plane nodes.
Additionally, bundling on the control plane nodes also increases the risk of
overloading the control plane and increases the risk profile of confidential
information on the control plane, such as SSH keys.
Load balancer separation
Prior to release 1.32, when you configure Layer 2 load balancing with MetalLB,
the control plane load balancers and the data plane load balancers run on the
same nodes. Depending on your configuration, the load balancers all run on the
control plane nodes or they all run in the load balancer node pool.
The following diagram shows the default bundled load balancer configuration with
both control plane and data plane load balancers running on control plane nodes
or both running in the load balancer node pool:
With version 1.32 clusters, you can configure the control plane load balancers
to run on the control plane nodes and the data plane load balancers to run in
the load balancer node pool. You can specify this separation of load balancers
when you create a new version 1.32 cluster, or you can update a version 1.32
cluster to migrate the data plane load balancers from the control plane nodes to
the load balancer node pool.
The cluster configuration for separated load balancers should look similar to
the following example:
apiVersion : baremetal.cluster.gke.io/v1
kind : Cluster
metadata :
name : hybrid-ha-lb
namespace : cluster-hybrid-ha-lb
spec :
type : hybrid
profile : default

Separate load balancers when creating a cluster
If you're creating a new version 1.32 or higher cluster, you can configure the
load balancers to run the control plane load balancers on the control plane
nodes and the data plane load balancers on the load balancer node pool.
The following diagram shows the control plane and data plane load balancers
separated on to different nodes:
To separate the load balancers when you create a cluster, use the following
steps:
In the cluster configuration file, specify a load balancer node pool with
loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec as described in the
loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec section of this
document.
Add controlPlane.loadBalancer.mode
to the cluster configuration file and set the mode value to bundled .
Finish configuring your cluster and run bmctl create cluster to create the
cluster.
Migrate data plane load balancers off of the control plane
If you have an existing version 1.32 or higher cluster where neither
controlPlane.loadBalancer.mode nor loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec is set, both
the control plane load balancer and the data plane load balancer run in the
control plane node pool. You can update the cluster to migrate the data plane
load balancer to a load balancer node pool.
The following diagram shows the control plane and data plane load balancers
separated after the data plane load balancer has been migrated off of the
control plane nodes:
To migrate the data plane load balancer to a load balancer node pool when you
update a cluster, use the following steps:
In the cluster configuration file, specify a load balancer node pool with
loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec as described in the
loadBalancer.nodePoolSpec section of this
document.
Add controlPlane.loadBalancer.mode
to the cluster configuration file and set the mode value to bundled .
Update the cluster by running the following command:
bmctl update cluster -c CLUSTER_NAME --kubeconfig = ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster you're
updating.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path of the admin cluster
kubeconfig file.
Preserving client source IP address
The LoadBalancer Service created with the bundled Layer 2 load balancing
solution uses the default Cluster setting for the external traffic policy.
This setting, spec.externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster , routes external traffic to
cluster-wide endpoints, but it also obscures the client source IP address.
Google Distributed Cloud supports two methods for preserving the client source IP
address :
Set the forwarding mode for load balancing to Direct Server Return (DSR).
For more information about DSR forwarding mode, including
instructions to enable it, see Configure load balancing forwarding mode .
Set the external traffic policy to local for the LoadBalancer Service and
configure related Services and Ingress accordingly. The following sections
describe how to configure your cluster to use this method.
LoadBalancer Services
When using externalTrafficPolicy: Local in your LoadBalancer Services, set
your application pods to run exactly on the load balancer nodes. Add the
following nodeSelector to your application pods to make this change:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
...
spec :
nodeSelector :
baremetal.cluster.gke.io/lbnode : "true"
...
NodePort Services
Kubernetes does source network address translation (SNAT) for NodePort
Services. To retain the client source IP addresses, set
service.spec.externalTrafficPolicy to Local . Kubernetes won't perform SNAT
anymore, but you must make sure there are pods running exactly on the node IP
you picked.
Ingress
If your applications are HTTP services, you can achieve client IP visibility
by configuring ingress components:
Open the istio-ingress Service for editing:
kubectl edit service -n gke-system istio-ingress
Add externalTrafficPolicy: Local to the spec , save and exit the
editor.
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
...
spec :
...
externalTrafficPolicy : Local
Open the istio-ingress Deployment for editing:
kubectl edit deployment -n gke-system istio-ingress
Add the following nodeSelector to the Deployment, save and exit the
editor.
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
...
spec :
...
template :
...
spec :
...
nodeSelector :
baremetal.cluster.gke.io/lbnode : "true"
...
Now, all of your services behind Ingress see a X-Forwarded-For header with the
client IP, like the following example:
X-Forwarded-For: 21.0.104.4
