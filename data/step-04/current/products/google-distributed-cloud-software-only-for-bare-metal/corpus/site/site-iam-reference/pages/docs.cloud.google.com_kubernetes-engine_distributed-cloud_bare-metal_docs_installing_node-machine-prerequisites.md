Cluster node machine prerequisites
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Distributed Cloud supports a wide variety of systems running on the
hardware that the target operating system distributions support.
A Google Distributed Cloud configuration can run on minimal hardware, or on
multiple machines to provide flexibility, availability, and performance.
Regardless of your Google Distributed Cloud configuration, your nodes and clusters
must have enough CPU, RAM, and storage resources to meet the needs of clusters
and the workloads that you're running.
This page is for Admins and architects and Operators who define IT
solutions and system architecture in accordance with company strategy. To learn
more about common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud
content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Minimum and recommended CPU, RAM, and storage requirements
When you install Google Distributed Cloud, you can create different types of
clusters:
A user cluster that runs workloads.
An admin cluster that creates and controls user clusters to run workloads.
A standalone cluster is a single cluster that can manage and run
workloads, but a standalone cluster can't create or manage user clusters.
A hybrid cluster can manage and run workloads, and a hybrid cluster can
also create and manage additional user clusters.
In addition to cluster type, you can choose from the following installation
profiles in terms of resource requirements:
Default : The default profile has standard system resource requirements,
and you can use it for all cluster types.
Edge : The edge profile has significantly reduced system resource
requirements. Use of this profile is recommended for edge devices with limited
resources. You can only use the edge profile for standalone clusters.
Warning: The following resource requirements don't take into account the
requirements of your workloads. You must consider separately the
resource requirements for your workloads to operate optimally.
Resource requirements for all cluster types using the default profile
The following table describes the minimum and recommended hardware requirements
that Google Distributed Cloud needs to operate and manage admin, hybrid, user, and
standalone clusters using the default profile:
Resource
Minimum
Recommended
CPUs / vCPUs *
4 core
8 core
RAM
16 GiB
32 GiB
Storage
128 GiB
256 GiB
* Google Distributed Cloud supports only x86-64 CPUs and vCPUs at the
CPU microarchitecture level v3 (x86-64-v3) and higher.
Resource requirements for standalone clusters using the edge profile
The following table describes the minimum and recommended hardware requirements
that Google Distributed Cloud needs to operate and manage standalone clusters
using the edge profile:
Resource
Minimum
Recommended
CPUs / vCPUs *
2 core
4 core
RAM
Ubuntu: 5 GiB RHEL: 6 GiB
Ubuntu: 8 GiB RHEL: 12 GiB
Storage
128 GiB
256 GiB
* Google Distributed Cloud supports only x86-64 CPUs and vCPUs at the
CPU microarchitecture level v3 (x86-64-v3) and higher.
To configure standalone clusters using the edge profile, follow these best practices:
Run bmctl on a separate workstation. If you must run bmctl on the target
cluster node, you need 2 GiB of memory to meet the
minimum requirements. For example, you require 6 GiB for Ubuntu and
8 GiB for RHEL.
Set MaxPodsPerNode to 110. The cluster runs no more than 30 user pods per
node on average. You might need extra resources for a higher MaxPodsPerNode
configuration or run more than 30 user pods per node.
VM Runtime on GDC components aren't considered in this minimum
resource configuration. VM Runtime on GDC requires additional
resources depending on the number of VMs deployed in the cluster.
Additional storage requirements
Google Distributed Cloud doesn't provide any storage resources. You must provision
and configure the required storage on your system.
For detailed storage requirements, see the
Installation prerequisites overview .
For more information about how to configure the storage required, see
Configuring storage for Google Distributed Cloud .
Node machine prerequisites
The node machines have the following prerequisites:
Meet the minimum hardware requirements.
Operating system is one of the supported Linux distributions. For more
information, including kernel requirements, see Select your operating
system .
Internet access.
Layer 3 connectivity to all other node machines.
Access to the control plane VIP.
Access to required ports. For specific port requirements for control plane
nodes, worker nodes, and load balancer nodes, see Port
usage on the Network
requirements page.
Properly configured DNS name servers.
No duplicate host names.
One of the following NTP services is enabled and working:
chrony
ntp
ntpdate
systemd-timesyncd
A working package manager, such as apt or dnf .
On Ubuntu, you must disable Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW). Run systemctl
stop ufw to disable UFW.
You must load either the nf-tables or iptables networking kernel modules.
If you have correctly loaded iptables , you will see the following output:
iptables --version
iptables v VERSION ( nf_tables )
Note: Don\'t use iptables-legacy . If you have iptables-legacy you must
uninstall the legacy version and reinstall the updated iptables kernel module.
To load a module , run the following command :
```sh
modprobe MODULE_NAME
```
Free disk space requirements:
1.29.100 and later
When you install Google Distributed Cloud, preflight checks run. These
checks confirm that the file systems for these directories have enough
capacity:
Directory
Space requirement
/ (root directory)
4 GiB (4,294,967,296 bytes)
/var/log/fluent-bit-buffers
12 GiB (12,884,901,888 bytes)
/var/opt/buffered-metrics
10016 MiB (10,502,537,216 bytes)
/var/lib/containerd
30 GiB (32,212,254,720 bytes) for control plane nodes
10 GiB (10,485,760 bytes) for worker nodes
/var/lib/kubelet
500 MiB (524,288,000 bytes)
/var/lib/etcd
20 GiB (21,474,836,480 bytes, applicable to control plane nodes only)
/var/lib/etcd-events
5 GiB (5,368,709,120 bytes, applicable to control plane nodes only)
To give you more control on the space you allocate for application
workloads, preflight checks for cluster creation only check for the
required free space for the Google Distributed Cloud system components.
You might require additional storage depending on the workloads that you
plan to deploy.
When you upgrade a cluster to version 1.29.100 or later, the preflight
checks verify that you have at least 2 GiB of free space available
in the / (root directory).
1.29.0 and earlier
Whenever you install Google Distributed Cloud, preflight checks run to
ensure that the file systems backing the following directories have the
required capacity:
Directory
Space requirement
/ (root directory)
17 GiB (18,253,611,008 bytes)
/var/lib/containerd
30 GiB (32,212,254,720 bytes) for control plane nodes
10 GiB (10,485,760 bytes) for worker nodes
/var/lib/kubelet
500 MiB (524,288,000 bytes)
/var/lib/etcd
20 GiB (21,474,836,480 bytes, applicable to control plane nodes only)
/var/lib/etcd-events
5 GiB (5,368,709,120 bytes, applicable to control plane nodes only)
To give you more control on the space you allocate for application
workloads, preflight checks for cluster creation only check for the
required free space for the Google Distributed Cloud system components.
You might require additional storage depending on the workloads that you
plan to deploy.
For any cluster version, the directories can reside on the same or different
disk partitions. If the directories share a disk partition, then calculate
the total space requirement by summing the space required for each
individual directory on that shared partition. The cluster setup creates
these directories if they don't already exist.
/var/lib/etcd and /etc/kubernetes directories are either non-existent or
empty.
For machines running RHEL 9.2 or Ubuntu 22.04, Linux kernel
inotify limits for maximum user instances and user watches must greater
than or equal to the following:
fs.inotify.max_user_instances : 8192
fs.inotify.max_user_watches : 524288
For more information, see the RHEL
or Ubuntu configuration
documentation.
In addition to the prerequisites for installing and running Google Distributed Cloud,
customers are expected to comply with relevant standards governing their industry
or business segment, such as PCI DSS requirements for businesses that process
credit cards or Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) for businesses
in the defense industry.
Load balancer machines prerequisites
When your deployment doesn't have a specialized load balancer node pool, you can
have worker nodes or control plane nodes build a load balancer node pool. In
that case, they have additional prerequisites:
Machines are in the same Layer 2 subnet.
All VIPs are in the load balancer nodes subnet and routable from the gateway
of the subnet.
The gateway of the load balancer subnet should listen to gratuitous ARPs to
forward packets to the main load balancer.
