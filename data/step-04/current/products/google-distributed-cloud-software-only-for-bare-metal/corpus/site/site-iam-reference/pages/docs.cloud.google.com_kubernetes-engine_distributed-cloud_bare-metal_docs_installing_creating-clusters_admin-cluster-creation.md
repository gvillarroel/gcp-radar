Create admin clusters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In Google Distributed Cloud, you set up admin clusters to manage other clusters
securely. You can create, update, upgrade, or delete user clusters from admin
clusters. The user clusters run workloads separately from administration, so
sensitive information is protected.
Admin clusters managing multi-cluster workloads can provide highly available
(HA) reliability. In an HA cluster, if one control plane node fails, other nodes
will continue to work.
An admin cluster in a multi-cluster environment provides the best fundamental
security. Because access to administration data is separated from workloads,
those who access user workloads have no access to sensitive administrative data,
like SSH keys and service account data. As a result, there is some trade-off
between security and the resources required, since a separate admin cluster
means you need dedicated resources for management and workloads.
You create an admin cluster using the bmctl command. After you create an admin
cluster, you create user
clusters to
run workloads.
Prerequisites:
Latest bmctl is downloaded
( gs://anthos-baremetal-release/bmctl/1.34.200-gke.68/linux-amd64/bmctl )
from Cloud Storage.
Workstation running bmctl has network connectivity to all nodes in the
target user clusters.
Workstation running bmctl has network connectivity to the cluster API
server (control plane VIP).
SSH key used to create the Admin cluster is available to either root or a
non-root user with passwordless sudo privileges
on all nodes in the target admin cluster.
Connect-register service account is configured for use with Connect.
See the Google Distributed Cloud quickstart for expanded
step-by-step instructions for creating a hybrid cluster. Creating an admin cluster
is similar to creating a hybrid cluster, except you don't run workloads on
the admin cluster.
Enable SELinux
If you want to enable SELinux to secure your containers, you must make sure that
SELinux is enabled in Enforced mode on all your host machines. Starting with
Google Distributed Cloud release 1.9.0 or later, you can enable or disable SELinux
before or after cluster creation or cluster upgrades. SELinux is enabled by
default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). If SELinux is disabled on
your host machines or you aren't sure, see
Securing your containers using SELinux
for instructions on how to enable it.
Google Distributed Cloud supports SELinux in only RHEL systems.
Log into the gcloud CLI and create an admin cluster config file
Set the default credentials that Google Distributed Cloud can use to create
the cluster with the following command:
gcloud auth application-default login
To use the automatic API enablement and service account creation features
in this page, grant the Project Owner role to that principal. If the
principal can't have the Project Owner role, complete the next step.
To ensure the cluster creation can succeed without granting the Project
Owner role, add the following IAM roles to the principal:
Service Account Admin
Service Account Key Admin
Project IAM Admin
Compute Viewer
Service Usage Admin
If the principal is a service account with those roles, you can run:
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = JSON_KEY_FILE
Replace JSON_KEY_FILE with the path to your
service account's JSON key file.
Get the ID of your Google Cloud project and store it in an environment variable to
use it for cluster creation:
export CLOUD_PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get-value project )
Create an admin cluster config with bmctl
After you've logged into the gcloud CLI and have your project set up, you
can create the cluster config file with the bmctl command.
Note: New clusters must be registered to a
fleet . Preflight checks will evaluate
Google Cloud connectivity, enabled APIs, and role permissions for service
accounts.
In the following example, all service accounts are automatically created by
the bmctl create config command:
bmctl create config -c ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME --enable-apis \
--create-service-accounts --project-id = CLOUD_PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the new cluster.
CLOUD_PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID or the
$CLOUD_PROJECT_ID environment variable.
Here's an example to create a configuration file for a admin cluster
called admin1 associated with project ID my-gcp-project :
bmctl create config -c admin1 --create-service-accounts --enable-apis --project-id = my-gcp-project
The file is written to bmctl-workspace/admin1/admin1.yaml .
As an alternative to automatically enabling APIs and creating service accounts,
you can also provide your existing service accounts with proper
IAM permissions. This means you can skip the automatic service account creation
in the previous example in the bmctl command:
bmctl create config -c admin1 --project-id = my-gcp-project
Edit the cluster configuration file
Now that you have a cluster configuration file, edit it to make the following changes:
Provide the SSH private key to access the admin cluster nodes:
# bmctl configuration variables. Because this section is valid YAML but not a valid Kubernetes
# resource, this section can only be included when using bmctl to
# create the initial admin/admin cluster. Afterwards, when creating user clusters by directly
# applying the cluster and node pool resources to the existing cluster, you must remove this
# section.
gcrKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/my-gcp-project-anthos-baremetal-gcr.json
sshPrivateKeyPath : /path/to/your/ssh_private_key
gkeConnectAgentServiceAccountKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/my-gcp-project-anthos-baremetal-connect.json
gkeConnectRegisterServiceAccountKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/my-gcp-project-anthos-baremetal-register.json
cloudOperationsServiceAccountKeyPath : bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys/my-gcp-project-anthos-baremetal-cloud-ops.json
Register your clusters to a fleet. The project ID that you specified
in the bmctl create config command is automatically added to the
gkeConnect.projectID field in the cluster configuration file. This project is
referred to as the
fleet host project .
If you created your configuration file using the automatic API enablement
and Service Account creation features, you can skip this step.
If you created the configuration file without using the automatic API
enablement and Service Account creation features, reference the downloaded
service account JSON keys in the corresponding
gkeConnectAgentServiceAccountKeyPath and
gkeConnectRegisterServiceAccountKeyPath fields of the cluster
configuration file.
Optionally, you can add
gkeConnect.location
to the cluster spec to specify the Google Cloud region in which the Fleet
and the Connect services run. This regional membership restricts fleet
service traffic to your region. If you include gkeConnect.location in
the cluster spec, the region that you specify must be the same as the
region configured in clusterOperations.location . If the regions aren't
the same, cluster creation fails.
Check to make sure the config specifies a cluster type of admin (the default value):
spec :
# Cluster type. This can be:
# 1) admin: to create an admin cluster. This can later be used to create user clusters.
# 2) user: to create a user cluster. Requires an existing admin cluster.
# 3) hybrid: to create a hybrid cluster that runs admin cluster components and user workloads.
# 4) standalone: to create a cluster that manages itself, runs user workloads, but does not manage other clusters.
type : admin
If the GKE On-Prem API is enabled in your
Google Cloud project, all clusters in the project are
enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API
automatically in the region configured in clusterOperations.location .
If you want to enroll all clusters in the project in the GKE On-Prem API,
be sure to do the steps in
Before you begin
to activate and use the GKE On-Prem API in the project.
If you don't want to enroll the cluster in the GKE On-Prem API, include
this section and set gkeOnPremAPI.enabled to false . If you don't
want to enroll any clusters in the project, disable
gkeonprem.googleapis.com (the service name for the GKE On-Prem API)
in the project. For instructions, see
Disabling services .
Change the configuration file to specify a multi-node, high availability control plane.
Specify an odd number of nodes to have a majority quorum for HA:
# Control plane configuration
controlPlane :
nodePoolSpec :
nodes :
# Control plane node pools. Typically, this is either a single machine
# or 3 machines if using a high availability deployment.
- address : 10.200.0.4
- address : 10.200.0.5
- address : 10.200.0.6
Note: If you have an even number of nodes temporarily while ading or
removing nodes for maintenance or replacement, your deployment maintains HA
as long as you have enough quorum.
Specify the pod density of cluster nodes:
....
# NodeConfig specifies the configuration that applies to all nodes in the cluster.
nodeConfig :
# podDensity specifies the pod density configuration.
podDensity :
# maxPodsPerNode specifies at most how many pods can be run on a single node.
maxPodsPerNode : 250
....
For admin clusters, allowable values for maxPodsPerNode are 32-250
for HA clusters and 64-250 for non-HA clusters. The default value if
unspecified is 110 . Once the cluster is created, this value cannot be
updated.
Pod density is also limited by your cluster's available IP resources. For details,
see
Pod networking .
Create the admin cluster with the cluster config
Use the bmctl command to deploy the cluster:
bmctl create cluster -c ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME specifies the cluster name created in
the previous section.
The following shows an example of the command to create a cluster
called admin1 :
bmctl create cluster -c admin1
