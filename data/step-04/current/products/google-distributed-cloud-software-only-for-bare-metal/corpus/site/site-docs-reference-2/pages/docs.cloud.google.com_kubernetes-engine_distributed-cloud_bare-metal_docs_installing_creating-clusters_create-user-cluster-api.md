Create a user cluster using GKE On-Prem API clients
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create a user cluster by using the Google Cloud console,
the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud CLI), or Terraform.
What is the GKE On-Prem API?
The GKE On-Prem API is a Google Cloud-hosted API that lets you manage the
lifecycle of your on-premises clusters using Terraform and standard
Google Cloud applications. The GKE On-Prem API runs in Google Cloud's
infrastructure. Terraform, the console, and the
gcloud CLI are clients of the API, and they use the API to create
clusters in your data center.
To manage the lifecycle of your clusters, the GKE On-Prem API must store
metadata about your cluster's state in Google Cloud, using the
Google Cloud region that you specify when creating the cluster. This
metadata lets the API manage the cluster lifecycle and doesn't
include workload-specific data.
When you create a cluster using an GKE On-Prem API client, you specify a
Google Cloud project. After the cluster is created, it is automatically
registered to the specified project's
fleet . This project is referred to as the
fleet host project .
The fleet host project can't be changed after the cluster is created.
If you prefer, you can create a user cluster by creating a user cluster
configuration file and using bmctl , as described in
Creating a user cluster .
If you want to use Terraform, the console or gcloud CLI
to manage the lifecycle of clusters that were created using bmctl , see
Configure a user cluster to be managed by the GKE On-Prem API ..
Before you begin
This section describes the requirements for creating a user cluster using
GKE On-Prem API clients.
Grant IAM permissions
If you aren't a project owner, you must be granted
roles/gkeonprem.admin .
If you want to access the Google Kubernetes Engine pages in the
console, you must also have the following roles:
roles/container.viewer .
roles/gkehub.viewer
After the cluster is created, if your aren't a project owner and you want to
use the connect gateway to
connect to the user cluster by the command line,
the following roles are required:
roles/gkehub.gatewayAdmin :
This role lets you access the Connect Gateway API. If you only need read-only
access to the cluster, the roles/gkehub.gatewayReader is sufficient.
roles/gkehub.viewer : This role
lets you retrieve cluster credentials.
For information on granting the roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Required Google APIs
Make sure that all the
required Google APIs
are enabled in the fleet host project.
If you will be using the gcloud CLI to create the cluster, you
must enable the GKE On-Prem API. If you are using the console
to create the cluster, it enables the GKE On-Prem API automatically.
gcloud services enable --project FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
gkeonprem.googleapis.com
Admin cluster prerequisites
You need a working admin cluster before you can create a user cluster. The admin
cluster must:
Have access to the Kubernetes API server on the user cluster after it is
created.
Have network connectivity to all nodes on the user cluster after it is
created.
Must be registered to a
fleet . The
project ID that is configured in the
gkeConnect.projectID ,
field of that admin cluster, which is referred to as the fleet host
project ,
must be the same project that you will be creating the user cluster in.
Cluster node machine prerequisites
Review
Cluster node machine prerequisites
to make sure that the machines that will be running the user cluster meet
the prerequisites.
Command line access
After the cluster is created, if you want to use the connect gateway to
run kubectl against the user cluster on
computers other than the admin workstation, install the following command-line
tools on the computer that you plan to use.
Note: If you are using Cloud Shell as your shell environment for
interacting with Google Cloud, these tools are installed for you.
The latest version of the gcloud CLI .
kubectl for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. If you need
to install kubectl , follow these
instructions .
Create a user cluster
You can use Terraform, the Google Cloud console, or the Google Cloud CLI
(gcloud CLI) to create a cluster that is managed by the
GKE On-Prem API. If this is your first time installing
Google Distributed Cloud, you might find the console the
easiest tool to use.
After you are more familiar with the information that you need to provide to
create clusters, you might find Terraform or the gcloud CLI more
convenient, particularly if you will be creating more than one cluster.
Terraform is an
industry-standard infrastructure as code tool. If your organization already
uses Terraform, then you will likely want to use it for creating clusters and
managing the cluster lifecycle.
With the gcloud CLI, you can save the command with its arguments to
a text file and make changes as needed to create additional clusters. If you are
using a CI/CD tool, such as Cloud Build , you can use the
gcloud commands to create a cluster and node pool and specify the
--impersonate-service-account flag to automate the creation.
Console
Most of the settings in the console correspond to the fields in
the cluster configuration file .
In the console, go to the Create a bare metal cluster
page.
Go to Create a bare metal cluster
Select the Google Cloud project that you want to create the cluster in.
The selected project is also used as the fleet host project. This must be
the same project that the admin cluster is registered to. After the user
cluster is created, it is automatically registered to the selected
project's fleet.
Click Next to begin configuring the cluster.
The following sections guide you through configuring the user cluster.
Cluster basics
Enter basic information about the cluster.
Enter a Name for the user cluster.
Under Admin cluster , select the admin cluster from the list.
In the Google Cloud API Location field, select the Google Cloud
region from the list. This setting specifies the region where the
following APIs and services run:
GKE On-Prem API ( gkeonprem.googleapis.com )
Fleet service ( gkehub.googleapis.com )
Connect service ( gkeconnect.googleapis.com )
This setting also controls the region in which the following are stored:
The user cluster metadata that the GKE On-Prem API needs
to manage the cluster lifecycle
The Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data of system components
The Admin Audit log created by Cloud Audit Logs
The cluster name, project, and location together uniquely identify the
cluster in Google Cloud.
Select the version for your user cluster. User clusters must be either
the same minor version as the admin cluster or one minor version lower
than the admin cluster.
As the cluster creator, you are granted cluster admin privileges to the
cluster. Optionally, enter the email address of another user who will
administer the cluster in the Admin user field.
When the cluster is created, the GKE On-Prem API applies the Kubernetes
role-based access control (RBAC) policies to the cluster to grant you and
other admin users the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, which
provides full access to every resource in the cluster in all namespaces.
Note: In addition to the Kubernetes RBAC policies, you must grant some
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the users who aren't project owners. For
details on granting the IAM roles, see
Grant required roles .
In the Node configuration section, specify the following:
Maximum Pods per node : Enter the maximum number of Pods that can be
run on a single node. Allowable values are between 32 – 250 ,
inclusive. Kubernetes assigns
a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block
to each node so that each pod can have a unique IP address. The size
of the CIDR block corresponds to the maximum number of pods per node.
For more information about setting the maximum number of pods per node,
Pod networking .
Container runtime : containerd is the only available container
runtime for your cluster.
Click Next to go to the Networking section.
Networking
In this section, you specify the IP addresses for your cluster's nodes, Pods,
and Services. If you are using bundled load balancing with MetalLB, you
configure that as well.
In the Control plane node section, enter the IPv4 address of each
control plane node. Control plane nodes run the system workload.
Typically, this is either a single machine if using a minimum deployment
or three machines if using a high availability (HA) deployment. Specify an
odd number of nodes to have a majority quorum for HA. This field can be
changed whenever you update or upgrade a cluster.
Click + Add IP Address as needed to enter more IP addresses.
In the Load balancer section, select the load balancer from the
Mode list to set up for your cluster. See
Overview of load balancers for
more information.
Bundled with MetalLB
Configure load balancing with the bundled MetalLB load balancer. With
this option, Google Distributed Cloud deploys Layer 4 load balancers
that run on either a dedicated pool of worker nodes or on the same
nodes as the control plane.
In the Load balancer node pools section, select one of the
following:
Use control plane nodes : Choose this option to run the load
balancers on the same nodes as the control plane.
Create load balancer node pool : Choose this advanced option
if you need to run the load balancers on a dedicated pool of
worker nodes. All nodes in the load balancer node pool must be
in the same Layer 2 subnet as the load balancer virtual IPs
(VIPs) that you configure in the Load balancer address pools
section.
In the Load balancer node pool IP 1 field, enter an
IPv4 address for a node in your load-balancer node pool.
Click + Add IP address as needed to enter additional
IP addresses.
In the Load balancer address pools section, add one or more
address pools for the MetalLB controller to choose from and assign
to Services of type LoadBalancer . The ingress VIP, which you
specify in the Virtual IPs section, must be in one of these
pools.
Enter a name for the address pool.
Enter an IP address range in either CIDR notation
(for example: 192.0.2.0/26) or range notation (for example:
192.0.2.64-192.0.2.72). To specify a single IP
address in a pool, use /32 in the CIDR notation (for example:
192.0.2.1/32).
If the ingress VIP isn't in the address range, select
+ Add IP Address Range and enter another address range
that includes the ingress VIP.
The IP addresses in each pool cannot overlap, and must be in
the same subnet as the cluster nodes.
Under Assignment of IP addresses , select one of the
following:
Automatic : Choose this option if you want the MetalLB
controller to automatically assign IP addresses from the
address pool to Services of type LoadBalancer .
Manual : Choose this option if you intend to use
addresses from the pool to manually specify addresses for
Services of type LoadBalancer .
Click Avoid buggy IP addresses if you want the MetalLB controller
to not use addresses from the pool that end in .0 or .255. This avoids
the problem of buggy consumer devices mistakenly dropping traffic sent
to those special IP addresses.
When you're finished click Done .
If needed, click Add Address Pool .
Manual load balancer
With manual load balancing, you configure your own load-balancing
solutions for control plane and data plane traffic. You must configure
your control plane VIP on the external load balancer before creating a
cluster. The external control plane load balancer can also be used for
data plane traffic, or you can set up a separate load balancer for the
data plane. For more information, see
Configure manual load balancing .
In the Virtual IPs section, enter the following:
Control plane VIP : The destination IP address to be used for traffic
sent to the user cluster's Kubernetes API server. The control plane VIP
must be in the same subnet as the load balancer nodes and must not
be in any of the address ranges used for the load balancer
address pools.
Port : The destination port used for traffic sent to the Kubernetes
API server. The default is 443.
Ingress VIP : The IP address to be configured on the load balancer
for the ingress proxy. Enter an address from one of the load balancer
address pools.
In the Service and Pod CIDRs section, specify the Kubernetes Service and
Pod IP address ranges in CIDR notation. They must not overlap with each
other, nor with any address outside the cluster that you want to reach from
inside the cluster. We recommend that you use the private IP address ranges
defined by
RFC 1918 . The
console provides the following default address ranges, but you can
change them:
Service CIDR : 10.96.0.0/20 If you don't accept the default, enter
a CIDR range between /24 and /12, where /12 provides the most IP
addresses.
Pod CIDR : 192.168.0.0/16 If you don't accept the default, enter
a CIDR range between between /18 and /8, where /8 provides the most IP
addresses.
In the Advanced attributes attributes section, optionally specify the
following:
Proxy URL : The HTTP address of your proxy server. Include the
port number even if it's the same as the scheme's default port, for
example: http://my-proxy.example.local:80
URLs : A comma-separated list of IP addresses, IP address ranges, host
names, and domain names that shouldn't go through the proxy server. When
Google Distributed Cloud sends a request to one of these addresses, hosts, or
domains, the request is sent directly.
Click Next .
Storage
Google Distributed Cloud software-only provides block and file storage interfaces.
They have default options, but you can customize the configurations. For more information,
see Configure local storage .
Optionally, you can configure the following:
Local volume provisioner node mounts : Specifies the configuration for
local PersistentVolumes (PVs) backed by mounted disks. You need to format
and mount these disks, which you can do before or after cluster creation.
Local volume provisioner share : Specifies the configuration for local
PersistentVolumes backed by subdirectories in a shared file system. These
subdirectories are automatically created during cluster creation.
Click Next .
Features
To help you monitor, troubleshoot, and operate your cluster, the following are
enabled automatically and can't be disabled:
Cloud Logging of system services
Cloud Monitoring of system services
The Admin Activity audit log
Create a node pool in the console
Your cluster must have at least one node pool for worker nodes. A
node pool is a template for the groups of worker nodes created in this cluster.
In the console, you configure at least one node pool (or accept
the default values) and then create the cluster. You can add additional node
pools after the cluster is created. With the gcloud CLI, you create
the cluster first and then add one or more node pools to the newly-created
cluster.
Click default pool in the left navigation bar.
In the Node pool defaults section, enter the Node pool name or
accept "default-pool" as the name.
In the Worker nodes section, enter the IP addresses of machines for the
cluster to run on.
In the Node pool metadata (optional) section, if you want to add
Kubernetes
labels
and
taints
do the following:
Click + Add Kubernetes Labels . Enter the Key and
Value for the label. Repeat as needed.
Click + Add Taint . Enter the Key , Value , and
Effect for the taint. Repeat as needed.
Click Verify and Complete to create the user cluster. It takes 15
minutes or more to create the user cluster. The console displays status
messages as it verifies the settings and creates the cluster in your data
center.
If there is a problem with the configuration, the console displays an
error message that should be clear enough for you to fix the configuration
issue and try again to create the cluster.
gcloud CLI
You use the following command to create a user cluster:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters create
After creating the cluster, you need to create at least one node pool using
the following command:
gcloud container bare-metal node-pools create
Most of the flags for creating the cluster and the node pool
correspond to the fields in the
user cluster configuration file .
To help you get started, you can test the complete command in the
Examples section. For information about the flags, see the
sections that follow the examples, or refer to the
gcloud CLI reference .
Before you begin
The version that you select when creating a user cluster must be a version
that your admin cluster supports. Additionally, the latest minor or patch
versions aren't available in the GKE On-Prem API until 7 to 14 days after the
release. You can run a gcloud command to get a list of supported cluster
versions that you can install.
Make sure to update components:
gcloud components update
Get the name and the fleet membership location of your admin cluster:
gcloud container fleet memberships list \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID
Replace FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID with ID of the
project that the admin cluster is registered to.
The output is similar to the following:
NAME EXTERNAL_ID LOCATION
admin-cluster-1 bb7803b4-8438-4b22-859f-4559b4b29072 global
admin-cluster-2 ee16ee2b-6ec0-49fc-9413-3c89cbc70854 global
admin-cluster-3 fc2b7ef5-39ff-4b63-b919-04c5adc67be4 us-west1
The location specifies where the Fleet and Connect services run. Admin
clusters created prior to 1.28 are managed by the global Fleet and
Connect services. In 1.28 and later, you can specify either global or
a Google Cloud region when you create the admin cluster. You specify the
region in the --admin-cluster-membership-location flag in the example
commands that follow.
Get a list of available versions to install on the user cluster:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters query-version-config \
--admin-cluster-membership= ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--admin-cluster-membership-project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--admin-cluster-membership-location= ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION \
--location= REGION
Replace the following:
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the admin cluster.
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that
the admin cluster is registered to.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION : The admin cluster's
fleet membership region. This is either global or a Google Cloud
region. Use the location for the admin cluster from the output
of gcloud container fleet memberships list .
REGION : The Google Cloud region that you
will use when you create the cluster. This is the region in which
the GKE On-Prem API and the Fleet and Connect services run. Specify
us-west1 or another
supported region .
The output of the command is similar to the following:
versions:
- version: 1.16.2
- version: 1.16.1
- version: 1.16.0
- version: 1.15.7
- version: 1.15.6
- version: 1.15.5
We suggest that you use the highest supported version to get the latest
fixes and improvements.
Examples
This section provides an example of a command that creates a cluster using
the MetalLB load balancer and an example using a manual load balancer.
The information that you specify varies depending on the type of load balancer
you will be using. See
Overview of load balancers for more
information.
The examples create the cluster without any node pools. After the cluster is
running, you must add a node pool
before deploying workloads.
MetalLB
This example shows how to create a user cluster with the bundled MetalLB
load balancer.
gcloud container bare-metal clusters create USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--admin-cluster-membership= ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--admin-cluster-membership-project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--admin-cluster-membership-location= ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION \
--location= REGION \
--version= VERSION \
--admin-users= YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
--admin-users= ANOTHER_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
--metal-lb-address-pools='pool= NAME ,avoid-buggy-ips= True|False ,manual-assign= True|False ,addresses= IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_1 ; IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_2 ;...' \
--control-plane-node-configs='node-ip= CP_IP_ADDRESS_1 ,labels= CP_KEY_1.1 = CP_VALUE_1.1 ; CP_KEY_1.2 = CP_VALUE_1.2 ;...' \
--control-plane-vip= CONTROL_PLANE_VIP \
--control-plane-load-balancer-port= CONTROL_PLANE_LB_PORT \
--ingress-vip= INGRESS_VIP \
--island-mode-service-address-cidr-blocks= SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK \
--island-mode-pod-address-cidr-blocks= POD_CIDR_BLOCK \
--lvp-share-path=/mnt/localpv-share \
--lvp-share-storage-class=local-shared \
--lvp-node-mounts-config-path=/mnt/localpv-disk \
--lvp-node-mounts-config-storage-class=local-disks
Replace the following:
USER_CLUSTER_NAME : A name of your choice for your user
cluster. The name can't be changed after the cluster is created.
The name must:
contain at most 40 characters
contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or a hyphen ( - )
start with an alphabetic character
end with an alphanumeric character
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that you
want to create the cluster in. The specified project is also used as the
fleet host project. This must be the same project that the admin cluster is
registered to. After the user cluster is created, it is automatically
registered to the selected project's fleet. The fleet host project
can't be changed after the cluster is created.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the admin cluster
that manages the user cluster. In the --admin-cluster-membership
flag, you can use the fully-specified cluster name, which has the
following format:
projects/ FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID /locations/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION /memberships/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME
Alternativly, you can set --admin-cluster-membership to the
admin cluster's name, as in the example command. When you use only the
admin cluster's name, set the admin cluster's project ID with the
--admin-cluster-membership-project and location with
--admin-cluster-membership-location . The admin cluster's
location is either global or a Google Cloud region. If you
need to find the region, run gcloud container fleet memberships
list .
REGION : The Google Cloud region in which the
GKE On-Prem API ( gkeonprem.googleapis.com ), Fleet service
( gkehub.googleapis.com ), and the Connect service
( gkeconnect.googleapis.com ) run. Specify us-west1
or another
supported region .
The region can't be changed after the cluster is created. This setting specifies the region
where the following are stored:
The user cluster metadata that the GKE On-Prem API needs
to manage the cluster lifecycle
The Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data of system components
The Admin Audit log created by Cloud Audit Logs
The cluster name, project, and location together uniquely identify the
cluster in Google Cloud.
Important If you plan to install Cloud Service Mesh, you must
install version 1.19.3 or later. This is required because the
Fleet and Connect services run in a region.
VERSION : The Google Distributed Cloud version for your
user cluster.
YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS and ANOTHER_EMAIL_ADDRESS :
If you don't include the --admin-users flag, as the cluster creator,
by default you are granted cluster admin privileges. But If you include
--admin-users to designate another user as an administrator, you
override the default and need to include both your email address and the
email address of the other administrator. For example, to add two
administrators:
--admin-users=sara@example.com \
--admin-users=amal@example.com
When the cluster is created, the GKE On-Prem API applies the Kubernetes
role-based access control (RBAC) policies to the cluster to grant you and
other admin users the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, which
provides full access to every resource in the cluster in all namespaces.
Note: In addition to the Kubernetes RBAC policies, you must grant some
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the users who aren't project owners.
For details on granting the IAM roles, see
Grant required roles .
MetalLB address pools
--metal-lb-address-pools : Specify the configuration for
address pools to be used by the MetalLB load balancer. The value for the
flag has the following format:
'pool= NAME ,avoid-buggy-ips= True|False ,manual-assign= True|False ,addresses= IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_1 ; IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_2 ;...' \
The value has segments that start with the keywords
pool , avoid-buggy-ip , manual-assign , and
addresses . Separate each segment with a comma.
pool : A name of your choice for the pool.
avoid-buggy-ips : If you set this to True , the MetalLB controller
doesn't assign IP addresses ending in .0 or .255 to Services. This
avoids the problem of buggy consumer devices mistakenly dropping
traffic sent to those special IP addresses. If not specified,
defaults to False .
manual-assign : If you don't want the MetalLB controller to
automatically assign IP addresses from this pool to Services, set
this to True . Then a developer can create a Service of type
LoadBalancer and manually specify one of the addresses from the
pool. If not specified, manual-assign is set to False .
In the list of addresses : Each address must be a range either in
CIDR or
hyphenated-range format. To specify a single IP address in a pool
(such as for the ingress VIP), use /32 in CIDR notation
(ex. 192.0.2.1/32).
Note the following syntax rules:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed.
Separate each IP address range with a semicolon.
You can specify more than one instance of the flag, as shown in the
following example:
--metal-lb-address-pools='pool=pool1,avoid-buggy-ips=False,manual-assign=True,addresses=192.0.2.0/26;192.0.2.64-192.0.2.72'
--metal-lb-address-pools='pool=pool2,avoid-buggy-ips=True,manual-assign=True,addresses=10.251.133.0/24;10.251.134.80/32'
MetalLB nodes
Optional: --metal-lb-load-balancer-node-configs :
By default, the load balancer runs on the same nodes as the control
plane. If you need to run the load balancer on a dedicated pool of
worker nodes, specify this flag for each node. All nodes in the load
balancer node pool must be in the same Layer 2 subnet as the load
balancer virtual IPs (VIPs).
Important: If you create your cluster without a dedicated load balancer
node pool, you can't add it later. For clusters configured with at least
one load balancer node, you can update the cluster to add more nodes
to the load balancer node pool.
The value for the flag has the following format:
'node-ip= LB_IP_ADDRESS_1 ,labels= LB_KEY_1.1 = LB_VALUE_1.1 ; LB_KEY_1.2 = LB_VALUE_1.2 ;...' \
The value has segments that start with the keywords node-ip and
labels . Separate each segment with a comma.
node-ip : The IP address of a node in your load-balancer node
pool. You can specify only one node-ip per flag. If you need
to specify more than one node, include the flag again for each
node.
labels : One or more key=value pairs attached to the node.
Note the following syntax rules:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed.
Separate each key=value pair in the labels segment with a
semicolon.
If you specify --metal-lb-load-balancer-node-configs , you can
optionally include the following flags:
--metal-lb-load-balancer-node-labels : Use this flag
to add
labels
to all nodes in the load balancer node pool. Separate the list of
key=value pairs with a comma.
--metal-lb-load-balancer-node-labels= KEY_1 = VALUE_1 , KEY_2 = VALUE_2
--metal-lb-load-balancer-node-taints : Use this flag
to add
taints
to all node in the load balancer node pool. Each taint is a
key=value pair associated with an effect, which must be one of the
following: PreferNoSchedule , NoSchedule , or NoExecute .
--metal-lb-load-balancer-node-taints= KEY_1 = VALUE_1 :EFFECT_1, KEY_2 = VALUE_2 : EFFECT_2
The following example adds three nodes to the load balancer node
pool. All the nodes are labeled with
lb-pool-key=lb-pool-value and have the taint
dedicated=experimental:PreferNoSchedule ,

Control plane nodes
--control-plane-node-configs :
The IPv4 address of a control plane node. Control plane nodes run the
system workload. Specify this flag for each control plane node.
Typically, you have a single machine if using a minimum deployment, or
three machines if using a high availability (HA) deployment. Specify an
odd number of nodes to have a majority quorum for HA. You can change
these addresses whenever you update or upgrade a cluster.
The value for the flag has the following format:
'node-ip= CP_IP_ADDRESS_1 ,labels= CP_KEY_1.1 = CP_VALUE_1.1 ; CP_KEY_1.2 = CP_VALUE_1.2 ;...' \
The value has segments that start with the keywords node-ip and
labels . Separate each segment with a comma.
node-ip : The IP address of a control plane node. You can specify
only one node-ip per flag. If you need to specify more than one
node, include the flag again for each node.
labels : One or more key=value pairs attached to the node.
Note the following syntax rules:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed.
Separate each key=value pair in the labels segment with a semicolon.
Optionally, include the following flags:
--control-plane-node-labels : Use this flag to add
labels to all control plane nodes. Separate the list of key=value pairs with a comma.
--control-plane-node-labels= KEY_1 = VALUE_1 , KEY_2 = VALUE_2
--control-plane-node-taints : Use this flag to add
taints to all control plane nodes. Each taint is a key=value pair associated
with an effect, which must be one of the following: PreferNoSchedule ,
NoSchedule , or NoExecute .
The following example adds three nodes to the control plane nodes. All
the nodes are labeled with cp-node-pool-key=cp-node-pool-value and
have the taint dedicated=experimental:PreferNoSchedule .
--control-plane-node-configs='node-ip=192.0.2.1' \
--control-plane-node-configs='node-ip=192.0.2.2,labels=key2.1=value2.1' \

address pools.
Service and Pod CIDRs
SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK : A range of IP addresses, in CIDR
format, to be used for Services in your cluster. The CIDR range must be between
/24 and /12, where /12 provides the most IP addresses.
Example: --island-mode-service-address-cidr-blocks=10.96.0.0/20
POD_CIDR_BLOCK : A range of IP addresses, in CIDR
format, to be used for Pods in your cluster. The CIDR range must be
between /18 and /8, where /8 provides the most IP addresses.
Example: --island-mode-pod-address-cidr-blocks=192.168.0.0/16
Storage
--lvp-share-path : This is the host machine path where subdirectories can
be created. A local PersistentVolume (PV) is created for each subdirectory.
--lvp-share-storage-class : This is the StorageClass to use to create
persistent volumes. The StorageClass is created during cluster creation.
--lvp-node-mounts-config-path : This is the host machine path where mounted
disks can be discovered. A local PersistentVolume (PV) is created for each mount.
--lvp-node-mounts-config-storage : The storage class that PVs are created
with during cluster creation.
For more information about storage, see
Configure local storage .
Manual
With manual load balancing, you configure your own load-balancing
solutions for control plane and data plane traffic. You must configure
your control plane VIP on the external load balancer before creating a
cluster. The external control plane load balancer can also be used for
data plane traffic, or you can set up a separate load balancer for the
data plane. For more information, see
Configure manual load balancing .

Replace the following:
USER_CLUSTER_NAME : A name of your choice for your user
cluster. The name can't be changed after the cluster is created.
The name must:
contain at most 40 characters
contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or a hyphen ( - )
start with an alphabetic character
end with an alphanumeric character
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that you
want to create the cluster in. The specified project is also used as the
fleet host project. This must be the same project that the admin cluster is
registered to. After the user cluster is created, it is automatically
registered to the selected project's fleet. The fleet host project
can't be changed after the cluster is created.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the admin cluster
that manages the user cluster. In the --admin-cluster-membership
flag, you can use the fully-specified cluster name, which has the
following format:
projects/ FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID /locations/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION /memberships/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME
Alternativly, you can set --admin-cluster-membership to the
admin cluster's name, as in the example command. When you use only the
admin cluster's name, set the admin cluster's project ID with the
--admin-cluster-membership-project and location with
--admin-cluster-membership-location . The admin cluster's
location is either global or a Google Cloud region. If you
need to find the region, run gcloud container fleet memberships
list .
REGION : The Google Cloud region in which the
GKE On-Prem API ( gkeonprem.googleapis.com ), Fleet service
( gkehub.googleapis.com ), and the Connect service
( gkeconnect.googleapis.com ) run. Specify us-west1
or another
supported region .
The region can't be changed after the cluster is created. This setting specifies the region
where the following are stored:
The user cluster metadata that the GKE On-Prem API needs
to manage the cluster lifecycle
The Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data of system components
The Admin Audit log created by Cloud Audit Logs
The cluster name, project, and location together uniquely identify the
cluster in Google Cloud.
Important If you plan to install Cloud Service Mesh, you must
install version 1.19.3 or later. This is required because the
Fleet and Connect services run in a region.
VERSION : The Google Distributed Cloud version for your
user cluster.
YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS and ANOTHER_EMAIL_ADDRESS :
If you don't include the --admin-users flag, as the cluster creator,
by default you are granted cluster admin privileges. But If you include
--admin-users to designate another user as an administrator, you
override the default and need to include both your email address and the
email address of the other administrator. For example, to add two
administrators:
--admin-users=sara@example.com \
--admin-users=amal@example.com
When the cluster is created, the GKE On-Prem API applies the Kubernetes
role-based access control (RBAC) policies to the cluster to grant you and
other admin users the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, which
provides full access to every resource in the cluster in all namespaces.
Note: In addition to the Kubernetes RBAC policies, you must grant some
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the users who aren't project owners.
For details on granting the IAM roles, see
Grant required roles .
Control plane nodes
--control-plane-node-configs :
The IPv4 address of a control plane node. Control plane nodes run the
system workload. Specify this flag for each control plane node.

odd number of nodes to have a majority quorum for HA. You can change
these addresses whenever you update or upgrade a cluster.
The value for the flag has the following format:
'node-ip= CP_IP_ADDRESS_1 ,labels= CP_KEY_1.1 = CP_VALUE_1.1 ; CP_KEY_1.2 = CP_VALUE_1.2 ;...' \
The value has segments that start with the keywords node-ip and
labels . Separate each segment with a comma.
node-ip : The IP address of a control plane node. You can specify
only one node-ip per flag. If you need to specify more than one
node, include the flag again for each node.
labels : One or more key=value pairs attached to the node.
Note the following syntax rules:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed.
Separate each key=value pair in the labels segment with a semicolon.
Optionally, include the following flags:
--control-plane-node-labels : Use this flag to add
labels to all control plane nodes. Separate the list of key=value pairs with a comma.
--control-plane-node-labels= KEY_1 = VALUE_1 , KEY_2 = VALUE_2
--control-plane-node-taints : Use this flag to add
taints to all control plane nodes. Each taint is a key=value pair associated
with an effect, which must be one of the following: PreferNoSchedule ,
NoSchedule , or NoExecute .
The following example adds three nodes to the control plane nodes. All
the nodes are labeled with cp-node-pool-key=cp-node-pool-value and
have the taint dedicated=experimental:PreferNoSchedule .
--control-plane-node-configs='node-ip=192.0.2.1' \
--control-plane-node-configs='node-ip=192.0.2.2,labels=key2.1=value2.1' \

persistent volumes. The StorageClass is created during cluster creation.
--lvp-node-mounts-config-path : This is the host machine path where mounted
disks can be discovered. A local PersistentVolume (PV) is created for each mount.
--lvp-node-mounts-config-storage : The storage class that PVs are created
with during cluster creation.
For more information about storage, see
Configure local storage .
Before running the gcloud command to create the cluster, you might want to
include --validate-only to validate the configuration that you specified in
the flags to the gcloud command. When you are ready to create the cluster,
remove this flag and run the command.
The output from the command is similar to the following:
Waiting for operation [projects/example-project-12345/locations/us-west1/operations/operation-1679543737105-5f7893fd5bae9-942b3f97-75e59179] to complete.
In the example output, the string operation-1679543737105-5f7893fd5bae9-942b3f97-75e59179
is the OPERATION_ID of the long-running operation. You
can find out the status of the operation with the following command:
gcloud container bare-metal operations describe OPERATION_ID \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION
It takes 15 minutes or more to create the user cluster. You can view
the cluster in the Google Cloud console on the
GKE clusters
page.
For a complete list of the flags and their descriptions, see the
gcloud CLI reference .
Create a node pool
After the cluster is created, you need to create at least one node pool before
deploying workloads. A node pool is a template for the groups of worker nodes
created in this cluster. With the gcloud CLI, you create
the cluster first and then add one or more node pools to the newly-created
cluster.
gcloud container bare-metal node-pools create NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster= USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION \
--node-configs='node-ip= NP_IP_ADDRESS_1 ,labels= NP_KEY_1.1 = NP_VALUE_1.1 ; NP_KEY_1.2 = NP_VALUE_1.2 ;...'
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : A name of your choice for the node
pool. The name must:
contain at most 40 characters
contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or a hyphen ( - )
start with an alphabetic character
end with an alphanumeric character
USER_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the newly-created
user cluster.
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that
the cluster is registered to.
REGION : The Google Cloud region that you
specified when you created the cluster.
--node-configs :
The IPv4 address of a worker node machine. Specify this flag for each
node. The value for the flag has the following format:
'node-ip= NP_IP_ADDRESS_1 ,labels= NP_KEY_1.1 = NP_VALUE_1.1 ; NP_KEY_1.2 = NP_VALUE_1.2 ;...' \
The value has segments that start with the keywords node-ip and
labels . Separate each segment with a comma.
node-ip : The IP address of a worker node. You can specify
only one node-ip per flag. Add this flag again for each node in
the node pool.
labels : One or more key=value pairs attached to the node.
Note the following syntax rules:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed.
Separate each key=value pair in the labels segment with a
semicolon.
Optionally, you can specify the following:
--node-labels= KEY = VALUE ,... : A
comma-separated list of
Kubernetes labels
(key=value pairs) applied to each node in the pool.
--node-taints= KEY = VALUE : EFFECT ,...
A comma-separated list of
Kubernetes taints
applied to each node in the pool. Taints are key=value pairs associated with
an effect. Taints are used with tolerations for Pod scheduling. Specify one
of the following for EFFECT : NoSchedule ,
PreferNoSchedule , NoExecute .
The following example creates a node pool called default-pool on
user-cluster- , and adds two nodes to the node pool. All
both nodes are labeled with node-pool-key=node-pool-value and
have the taint dedicated=experimental:PreferNoSchedule ,
gcloud container bare-metal node-pools create default-pool \
--cluster=user-cluster-1 \
--project=example-project-12345 \
--location=us-west1 \
--node-configs='node-ip=10.200.0.10' \
--node-configs='node-ip=10.200.0.11,labels=key2.1=value2.1' \
--node-labels=node-pool-key=node-pool-value \
--node-taints=dedicated=experimental:PreferNoSchedule
For more information, see the
gcloud CLI reference .
Terraform
Before you begin
The Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on bare metal version that you
select when creating a user cluster must be a version that your admin cluster
supports. Additionally, the latest minor or patch versions aren't available in
the GKE On-Prem API until 7 to 14 days after the release. You can run a
gcloud command to get a list of supported versions that you can use to
install the user cluster.
Make sure to update components:
gcloud components update
Get the name and the fleet membership location of your admin cluster:
gcloud container fleet memberships list \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID
Replace FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID with ID of the
project that the admin cluster is registered to.
The output is similar to the following:
NAME EXTERNAL_ID LOCATION
admin-cluster-1 bb7803b4-8438-4b22-859f-4559b4b29072 global
admin-cluster-2 ee16ee2b-6ec0-49fc-9413-3c89cbc70854 global
admin-cluster-3 fc2b7ef5-39ff-4b63-b919-04c5adc67be4 us-west1
The location specifies where the Fleet and Connect services run. Admin
clusters created prior to 1.28 are managed by the global Fleet and
Connect services. In 1.28 and later, you can specify either global or
a Google Cloud region when you create the admin cluster. You specify the
region in the --admin-cluster-membership-location flag in the example
commands that follow.
Get a list of available versions to install on the user cluster:
gcloud container bare-metal clusters query-version-config \
--admin-cluster-membership= ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--admin-cluster-membership-project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--admin-cluster-membership-location= ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION \
--location= REGION
Replace the following:
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the admin cluster.
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that
the admin cluster is registered to.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION : The admin cluster's
fleet membership region. This is either global or a Google Cloud
region. Use the location for the admin cluster from the output
of gcloud container fleet memberships list .
REGION : The Google Cloud region that you
will use when you create the cluster. This is the region in which
the GKE On-Prem API and the Fleet and Connect services run. Specify
us-west1 or another
supported region .
The output of the command is similar to the following:
versions:
- version: 1.16.2
- version: 1.16.1
- version: 1.16.0
- version: 1.15.7
- version: 1.15.6
- version: 1.15.5
We suggest that you use the highest supported version to get the latest
fixes and improvements.
Example
You can use the following basic configuration sample to create a user cluster
with bundled MetalLB load balancer. For more information, see the
google_gkeonprem_bare_metal_cluster reference documentation .
Set variables in terraform.tfvars
The sample provides an example variables file to pass in to main.tf , which
shows how to configure the bundled MetalLB load balancer.
Clone the anthos-samples repository and change to the directory
where the Terraform sample is located:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-samples
cd anthos-samples/anthos-onprem-terraform/abm_user_cluster_metallb
The sample provides an example variables file to pass in to main.tf .
Make a copy of the terraform.tfvars.sample file:
cp terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
Modify the parameters values in terraform.tfvars and save the file.
project_id = " PROJECT_ID "
region = " ON_PREM_API_REGION "
admin_cluster_name = " ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME "
bare_metal_version = " VERSION "
admin_user_emails = [ " YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS " , " ADMIN_2_EMAIL_ADDRESS " ]
cluster_name = "abm-user-cluster-metallb"
control_plane_ips = [ "10.200.0.4" ]
worker_node_ips = [ "10.200.0.5" , "10.200.0.6" ]
control_plane_vip = "10.200.0.50"
ingress_vip = "10.200.0.51"
lb_address_pools = [
{ name = "lbpool_1" , addresses = [ "10.200.0.51-10.200.0.70" ] }
]
The following list describes the variables:
project_id : The ID of the project that you want to create the cluster
in. The specified project is also used as the fleet host project. This
must be the same project that the admin cluster is registered to. After
the user cluster is created, it is automatically registered to the
selected project's fleet. The fleet host project can't be changed after
the cluster is created.
region : The Google Cloud region in which the GKE On-Prem API
( gkeonprem.googleapis.com ), Fleet service ( gkehub.googleapis.com ),
and the Connect service ( gkeconnect.googleapis.com ) run. Specify
us-west1 or another
supported region .
Important: If you plan to install Cloud Service Mesh, you must install
version 1.19.3 or later. This is required because the Fleet and Connect
services run in a region.
admin_cluster_name : The name of the admin cluster that manages the user
cluster. The example assumes that the admin cluster uses global as the
region. If you have a regional admin cluster:
Open main.tf in a text editor.
Search for admin_cluster_membership , which looks like the
following:
admin_cluster_membership = "projects/${var.project_id}/locations/global/memberships/${var.admin_cluster_name}"
Change global to the region that the admin cluster uses and save
the file.
bare_metal_version : The Google Distributed Cloud version for your user
cluster. Specify either the same version as the admin cluster, or a
version that is no more than one minor version lower than the admin
cluster.
admin_user_emails : A list of email addresses of the users to be granted
administrative privileges on the cluster. Be sure to add your email
address if you intend to administer the cluster.
When the cluster is created, the GKE On-Prem API applies the Kubernetes
role-based access control (RBAC) policies to the cluster to grant the
admin users the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, which
provides full access to every resource in the cluster in all namespaces.
This also lets users log on to the console using their
Google identity.
cluster_name : A name of your choice for your user cluster. The name
can't be changed after the cluster is created. The name must:
contain at most 40 characters
contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or a hyphen ( - )
start with an alphabetic character
end with an alphanumeric character
control_plane_ips : A list of one or more IPv4 addresses for the control
plane nodes. Control plane nodes run the system workload. Typically, you
have a single machine if using a minimum deployment, or three machines if
using a high availability (HA) deployment. Specify an odd number of nodes
to have a majority quorum for HA. You can change these addresses whenever
you update or upgrade a cluster.
worker_node_ips : A list of one or more IPv4 addresses for the worker
node machines.
control_plane_vip : The virtual IP address (VIP) that you have chosen to
configure on the load balancer for the Kubernetes API server of the user
cluster.
ingress_vip : The IP address that you have chosen to configure on the
load balancer for the ingress proxy.
lb_address_pools : A list of maps that define the address pools to be
used by the MetalLB load balancer. The ingress VIP must be in one of these
pools.
Save the changes in terraform.tfvars .
Initialize and create the Terraform plan:
terraform init
Terraform installs any needed libraries, such as the Google Cloud provider.
Review the configuration and make changes if needed:
terraform plan
Apply the Terraform plan to create the user cluster:
terraform apply
It takes 15 minutes or more to create the user cluster. You can view
the cluster in the Google Cloud console on the
GKE clusters
page.
Connect to the user cluster
When you create a user cluster in the console, the cluster is configured with
the Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies so that you can log in
to the cluster using your Google Cloud identity. When you create a user cluster
with the gcloud CLI, by default you are granted these RBAC policies
if you don't include the --admin-users flag. If you include
--admin-users to designate another user as an administrator, you override
the default and you need to include both your email address and the
email address of the other administrator. For more information about the
required IAM and RBAC policies, see
Set up Google identity authentication .
All clusters have a canonical endpoint. The endpoint exposes the Kubernetes API
server that kubectl and other services use to communicate with your cluster
control plane over TCP port 443. This endpoint is not accessible on the public
internet. If you have access to your cluster's private endpoint through your
VPC, you can connect directly to the private endpoint and generate a
kubeconfig file directly. Otherwise, you can use
connect gateway .
To access the user cluster from the command line, you need a kubeconfig file.
There are two ways to get a kubeconfig file:
Use the connect gateway to access the cluster from a computer that has the
Google Cloud CLI installed on it. In this case, kubectl uses the Connect
gateway's kubeconfig , which securely forwards the traffic to the private
endpoint on your behalf.
For direct access to private endpoints, create a kubeconfig file on your
admin workstation and manage the cluster from your admin workstation.
Be sure to wait until the Google Cloud console indicates that user cluster
status is healthy.
Connect gateway
Either initialize the
gcloud CLI for use with the fleet host project, or run the
following commands to log in with your Google Account, set your fleet
host project as the default, and update components:
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud components update
Fetch the cluster credentials used to interact with connect gateway. In
the following command, replace MEMBERSHIP_NAME with
your cluster's name. For Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on bare
metal, the membership name is the same as the cluster name.
gcloud container fleet memberships get-credentials MEMBERSHIP_NAME
This command returns a special connect gateway-specific kubeconfig
that lets you connect to the cluster through the gateway.
After you have the necessary credentials, you can run commands using
kubectl as you normally would for any Kubernetes cluster, and you don't need
to specify the name of the kubeconfig file, for example:
kubectl get namespaces
Admin workstation
Use the bmctl get credentials command to retrieve a kubeconfig file for
the newly created user cluster.
bmctl get credentials --cluster CLUSTER_NAME --admin-kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG_PATH
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the target user cluster.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG_PATH : the path to the admin cluster kubeconfig
file.
A kubeconfig with the user cluster's credentials are written to a file,
bmctl-workspace/ CLUSTER_NAME / CLUSTER_NAME - TIMESTAMP -kubeconfig .
The TIMESTAMP in the filename indicates the date and time the file
was created.
Because this file contains authentication credentials for your
cluster, you should store it in a secure location with restricted access.
