Create an admin cluster using GKE On-Prem API clients
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create an admin cluster by using the Google Cloud console
or the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud CLI). Both of these standard
Google Cloud clients use the GKE On-Prem API to create the cluster.
What is the GKE On-Prem API?
The GKE On-Prem API is a Google Cloud-hosted API that lets you manage the
lifecycle of your on-premises clusters using Terraform and standard
Google Cloud applications. The GKE On-Prem API runs in Google Cloud's
infrastructure. Terraform, the console, and the
gcloud CLI are clients of the API, and they use the API to create
clusters in your data center.
To manage the lifecycle of your clusters, the GKE On-Prem API must store
metadata about your cluster's state in Google Cloud, using the
Google Cloud region that you specify when creating the cluster. This
metadata lets the API manage the cluster lifecycle and doesn't
include workload-specific data.
When you create a cluster using an GKE On-Prem API client, you specify a
Google Cloud project. After the cluster is created, it is automatically
registered to the specified project's
fleet . This project is referred to as the
fleet host project .
The fleet host project can't be changed after the cluster is created.
If you prefer, you can create an admin cluster by creating an admin cluster
configuration file and using bmctl , as described in
Creating an admin cluster .
If you want to use the console or gcloud CLI to manage
the lifecycle of clusters that were created using bmctl , see
Configure clusters to be managed by the GKE On-Prem API .
IAM permissions
If you aren't a Google Cloud project owner, you must have a project owner
grant you the following roles:
roles/compute.viewer
roles/gkeonprem.admin
roles/gkehub.viewer
roles/iam.securityAdmin
roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin
roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
If you want to access the Google Kubernetes Engine pages in the console, you
must also have
roles/container.viewer .
For information on granting the roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Command line access
After the cluster is created, if you want to use the
connect gateway to run
kubectl commands against the cluster on computers other than the admin
workstation, install the following command-line tools on the computer that you
plan to use.
The latest version of the gcloud CLI .
kubectl for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. If you need
to install kubectl , follow these
instructions .
Note: If you are using Cloud Shell as your shell environment for
interacting with Google Cloud, these tools are installed for you.
Choose the client to create the admin cluster
You can use either the console or the gcloud CLI
to create an admin cluster that is managed by the GKE On-Prem API. If this is
your first time installing Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on bare metal,
you might find the console easier to use than the
gcloud CLI.
After you are more familiar with the information that you need to provide for
creating clusters, you might find the gcloud CLI more convenient
because you can save the command with its arguments to a text file. If you are
using a CI/CD tool, such as Cloud Build , you can use
the gcloud commands to create a cluster and specify the
--impersonate-service-account flag to automate the creation.
Prerequisites
Console
In the console, go to the Create a
bare metal cluster page.
Go to Create a bare metal cluster
Select the Google Cloud project that you want to create the cluster in.
The selected project is also used as the fleet host project.
The Prerequisites page displays the requirements for your admin
workstation and cluster node machines. The IP address planner in the
Network requirements section helps you plan the IP addresses needed for
a minimal installation of one admin cluster and one user cluster.
Admin workstation prerequisites
Expand this section to display the hardware, operating system, and
connectivity requirements for your admin workstation.
Cluster node machine prerequisites
Expand this section to display the hardware, operating system, and
connectivity requirements for the cluster node machines.
Network requirements
This section helps you plan the IP addresses that you need for a minimal
environment. Optionally, in the Node IP and Virtual IP addresses section,
you can provide a starting node IP address and a virtual IP address (VIP),
and the console displays a table of IP addresses that you need.
These IP addresses aren't applied to the admin cluster configuration. They
are meant as a guide to help you plan the IP addresses that you need for your
installation. You can download the table to a CSV file and import it into a
spreadsheet or IP address planning tool to use as a starting point to track
the IP addresses needed for your clusters.
Review Google Cloud resources :
Make sure that all the
required Google APIs
are enabled in the fleet host project. In addition, you need to enable the
GKE On-Prem API:
gcloud services enable --project FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
gkeonprem.googleapis.com
Replace FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID with the project ID of the
fleet host project.
Before creating the cluster, you run the bmctl register bootstrap command on
your admin workstation as described in
Prepare bootstrap environment . This command
can create the required service accounts with the minimum
required IAM permissions needed to create the admin cluster.
If you prefer, you can
Configure service accounts manually .
When you are ready to begin, click Install bootstrap environment in the
left navigation bar.
gcloud CLI
Hardware, networking, and operating system prerequisites
Creating an admin cluster using a GKE On-Prem API client requires the same
hardware, networking, and operating system prerequisites as creating the cluster
using bmctl . For details,
see Installation prerequisites .
Required Google APIs
Make sure that all the
required Google APIs
are enabled in the fleet host project. In addition, you need to enable the
GKE On-Prem API:
gcloud services enable --project FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
gkeonprem.googleapis.com
Replace FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID with the project ID of the
fleet host project.
Required service accounts and permissions
Before creating the cluster, you run the bmctl register bootstrap command on
your admin workstation as described in
Prepare bootstrap environment . This command
can create the required service accounts with the minimum
required IAM permissions needed to create the admin cluster.
If you prefer, you can
Configure service accounts manually .
Plan IP addresses
Before creating the admin cluster, you need to plan the IP addresses for your
clusters. Review Plan your IP addresses
for an example of how to allocate IP addresses for a high-availability (HA)
admin cluster and two HA user clusters. Even if you will be using
the gcloud CLI to create the admin cluster, you might want to follow
the console steps in this section to use the IP address
planner.
Prepare bootstrap environment
Before you create the admin cluster, you need to run the
bmctl register bootstrap command on your admin workstation. This command
deploys a Kubernetes in Docker
(kind) cluster on the admin workstation. This bootstrap cluster hosts the
Kubernetes controllers needed to create the admin cluster. When you create the
admin cluster, the controllers on the bootstrap cluster will provision nodes,
run preflight checks, and register the admin cluster to the fleet. The bootstrap
cluster is automatically deleted after the cluster is successfully created.
Console
Enter a Name for the admin cluster. Notice that the bootstrap cluster
name is derived by prepending bootstrap- to the admin cluster name.
Select the version for your admin cluster.
In the Google Cloud API Location field, select the Google Cloud
region from the list. This setting specifies the region where the
following APIs and services run:
GKE On-Prem API ( gkeonprem.googleapis.com )
Fleet service ( gkehub.googleapis.com )
Connect service ( gkeconnect.googleapis.com )
This setting also controls the region in which the following are stored:
The cluster metadata that the GKE On-Prem API needs
to manage the cluster lifecycle
The Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data of system components
The Admin Audit log created by Cloud Audit Logs
The cluster name, project, and location together uniquely identify the
cluster in Google Cloud.
The console displays the commands that you need to run
on your admin workstation. The bmctl command-line tool must match
the version of the cluster that you're creating. If you already have
the applicable version of bmctl downloaded to your admin workstation,
you don't need to download it again.
gcloud CLI
Make sure to update components:
gcloud components update
Run the following command to sign in with your Google Account:
gcloud auth login
List the available bare metal cluster versions that you can install:
The bmctl version that you download to create the bootstrap environment
must match the version that you will install on the admin cluster.
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters query-version-config \
--location= REGION
Replace REGION with the Google Cloud region
that you will use when you create the cluster. This is the region in which
the GKE On-Prem API and the Fleet and Connect services run. Specify
us-west1 or another
supported region .
Create the bootstrap cluster
Do the following steps on your admin workstation. These commands are displayed
in the console.
Set your user credentials as Application Default Credentials (ADC):
gcloud auth application-default login
Follow the prompts to select your Google Account for ADC.
If needed, download the bmctl command-line tool to the current working
directory.
gcloud storage cp gs://anthos-baremetal-release/bmctl/ VERSION /linux-amd64/bmctl .
chmod a+x ./bmctl
Replace VERSION with the bare metal cluster version you
want to install. If you copied the command from the console,
the version is already in the command.
Create the bootstrap cluster. You can either let bmctl create
the required service accounts (SAs), or you
can create the service accounts
and key files yourself and pass them to the bmctl register bootstrap
command.
bmctl creates SAs
Use the following command if you want bmctl to create the required
service accounts with the minimum required permissions needed to
create the admin cluster. This command assumes that bmctl is
in the current working directory.
./bmctl register bootstrap \
--ssh-key= YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
--target-cluster-name= ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project-id= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY : The path to your private
SSH key. You created the SSH key when you
set up root SSH access to nodes .
If you copied the command displayed in the console, the
following fields are already filled in for you.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of your admin cluster.
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The project that the admin
cluster will be automatically registered to after the cluster is created.
The bmctl register bootstrap command creates the following service accounts.
The service account keys are stored in the directory
bmctl-workspace/.sa-keys .
Service account
Purpose
IAM roles
anthos-baremetal-gcr
Google Distributed Cloud uses this service account to download container
images from Artifact Registry.
None
anthos-baremetal-connect
Connect Agent uses this service account to maintain a connection between
your cluster and Google Cloud.
roles/gkehub.connect
anthos-baremetal-register
Connect Agent uses this service account to register your clusters to the
Google Cloud fleet.
roles/gkehub.admin
anthos-baremetal-cloud-ops
Stackdriver Agent uses this service account to export logs and metrics
from clusters to Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring.
roles/logging.logWriter
roles/monitoring.metricWriter
roles/stackdriver.resourceMetadata.writer
roles/opsconfigmonitoring.resourceMetadata.writer
roles/monitoring.dashboardEditor
roles/monitoring.viewer
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer
roles/kubernetesmetadata.publisher
Specify SA key files
If you prefer, you can pass bmctl the service account key files
that you created. The following command uses the key file names in
Configure service accounts manually
and assumes that bmctl and the key files are in the current working
directory.
Note: The --target-cluster-name flag is supported for Google Distributed Cloud
version 1.16.0 and higher. This flag replaces the --name flag, which
required you to specify the bootstrap cluster name derived from the admin
cluster name.
./bmctl register bootstrap \
--ssh-key= YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
--target-cluster-name= ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project-id= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--gcr-service-account-key=anthos-baremetal-gcr.json \
--gke-agent-service-account-key=connect-agent.json \
--gke-register-service-account-key=connect-register.json \
--cloud-operation-service-account-key=anthos-baremetal-cloud-ops.json
Replace the following:
YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY : The path to your private
SSH key. You created the SSH key when you
set up root SSH access to nodes .
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of your admin cluster.
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The project that the admin
cluster will be automatically registered to after the cluster is created.
The following flags specify the path to the key files:
-gcr-service-account-key : The path to the key file for the service
account that pulls container images ( anthos-baremetal-gcr ).
--gke-agent-service-account-key : The path to the key file for
the Connect Agent service account ( anthos-baremetal-connect ).
--gke-register-service-account-key : The path to the key file for
the Connect Agent service account that registers the cluster to the
fleet ( anthos-baremetal-register ).
--cloud-operation-service-account-key : The path to the key file for
the service account to audit logs and monitor projects
( anthos-baremetal-cloud-ops ).
After bmctl successfully creates the bootstrap cluster, you see output
similar to the following:
[2023-03-22 17:35:24+0000] Waiting for the temporary cluster to be registered... OK
[2023-03-22 17:35:37+0000] Please go to https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=example-project-12345 to create the cluster
[2023-03-22 17:35:37+0000] Waiting for preflight checks and cluster to run..
Caution: Leave the command running while you create the admin cluster. If
you exit out of the bmctl register bootstrap command before the admin cluster
is created, the admin cluster creation fails. After the cluster is successfully
created, the command automatically deletes the bootstrap cluster and exits.
Create the admin cluster
Console
On the Install bootstrap environment page, click
Check Connection .
On success, the console displays
check_circle Connection established .
The connection to the bootstrap cluster must be established before you
continue. If the connection isn't established, check the arguments that
you specified to the bmctl register bootstrap command:
Make sure that the value for --target-cluster-name matches the
Admin cluster name displayed in the
Bootstrap environment basics section.
Make sure the value for --project-id matches the ID of the project
that you selected in the console.
If you need to change the bootstrap cluster name or the project ID,
enter Ctrl-C to exit out of bmctl register bootstrap and
re-run the command.
Click Next to begin configuring the admin cluster. Most of the
settings in the console correspond to the fields in
the cluster configuration file .
Under Node configuration , enter a value between
64 and 250 in Maximum Pods per node , or accept the default, 110.
After the cluster is created, you can't update this value.
The maximum Pods per node (referred to as Pod density} is also limited by
your cluster's available IP resources. For details,
see Pod networking .
Click Next .
On the Networking page, define how your nodes and components in the
cluster communicate with each other and with the Kubernetes control plane.
For detailed information, hold the pointer over
the question_mark next to each
field.
Click Verify and Create .
The console displays status messages as it verifies the settings and
creates the cluster in your data center.
If there is a problem with the configuration, the console displays an
error message that should be clear enough for you to fix the configuration
issue and try again to create the cluster.
gcloud CLI
Before creating the admin cluster, confirm that the bootstrap cluster
has been registered as a member of the fleet:
gcloud container fleet memberships list \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID
If the bootstrap cluster isn't listed, check the bootstrap cluster name and
project ID that you specified to bmctl register bootstrap . If you need to
change the bootstrap cluster name or the project ID, enter Ctrl-C to exit
out of bmctl register bootstrap and re-run the command.
Use the following command to create an admin cluster:
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters create
Most of the flags that you specify to the command correspond to the fields
in the
user cluster configuration file .
To create an admin cluster with the bundled load balancer:
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters create ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION \
--version= VERSION \
--max-pods-per-node= MAX_PODS_PER_NODE \
--control-plane-vip= CONTROL_PLANE_VIP \
--control-plane-load-balancer-port= CONTROL_PLANE_LOAD_BALANCER_PORT \
--control-plane-node-configs ' CONTROL_PLANE_NODE_CONFIG ' \
--island-mode-service-address-cidr-blocks= SERVICE_ADDR_CIDR \
--island-mode-pod-address-cidr-blocks= POD_ADDR_CIDR \
--lvp-share-path=/mnt/localpv-share \
--lvp-share-storage-class=local-shared \
--lvp-node-mounts-config-path=/mnt/localpv-disk \
--lvp-node-mounts-config-storage-class=local-disks
If you want to use manual load balancing, add --enable-manual-lb to the
command.
Replace the following:
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of your admin cluster.
The name can't be changed after the cluster is created.
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The project that the admin
cluster will be automatically registered to after the cluster is created.
The fleet host project can't be changed after the cluster is created.
REGION : The Google Cloud region in which the
GKE On-Prem API runs. Specify us-west1 or another
supported region .
The region can't be changed after the cluster is created. This setting
specifies the region where the following are stored:
The cluster metadata that the GKE On-Prem API needs to manage the
cluster lifecycle
The Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data of system components
The Admin Audit log created by Cloud Audit Logs
The cluster name, project, and location together uniquely identify the
cluster in Google Cloud.
VERSION : The bare metal cluster version. The version
must match the bmctl version that you used to run
bmctl register bootstrap . You can check the bmctl version by
running bmctl version on the admin workstation.
MAX_PODS_PER_NODE : For admin clusters, allowable values
are 32-250 and 64-250 for non-HA clusters. The default value if
--max-pods-per-node isn't included in the command is 110. After
the cluster is created, this value cannot be updated.
The maximum Pods per node (referred to as Pod density) is also limited by
your cluster's available IP resources. For details,
see Pod networking .
CONTROL_PLANE_VIP : The virtual IP (VIP) on the load
balancer for the cluster's Kubernetes API server. Include the control plane
VIP in the same subnet as the load balancer nodes. Don't include the
control plane VIP in the load balancer address pools.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOAD_BALANCER_PORT : The port the load
balancer serves the control plane on. Although you can configure another
value, port 443 is the standard port used for HTTPS connections.
CONTROL_PLANE_NODE_CONFIG : The IPv4 address of a
control plane node. Control plane nodes run the system workload. Specify
this flag for each control plane node. Typically, you have a single machine
if using a minimum deployment, or three machines if using a
high availability (HA) deployment. Specify an odd number of nodes to have a
majority quorum for HA. You can change these addresses whenever you update
or upgrade the cluster.
The value for the flag has the following format:
'node-ip= CP_IP_ADDRESS_1 ,labels= CP_KEY_1.1 = CP_VALUE_1.1 ; CP_KEY_1.2 = CP_VALUE_1.2 ;...' \
The value has segments that start with the keywords node-ip and
labels . Separate each segment with a comma.
node-ip : The IP address of a control plane node. You can specify
only one node-ip per flag. If you need to specify more than one
node, include the flag again for each node.
labels : One or more key=value pairs attached to the node.
Note the following syntax rules:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed.
Separate each key=value pair in the labels segment with a
semicolon.
For example:
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip=192.0.2.1' \
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip=192.0.2.2,labels=key2.1=value2.1' \
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip=192.0.2.3,labels=key3.1=value3.1;key3.2=value3.2' \
SERVICE_ADDR_CIDR : A range of IPv4 addresses, in
CIDR format, for Services in your cluster. The CIDR range must be between
/24 and /12, where /12 provides the most IP addresses. We recommend
that you use a range in the IP address space for private internets,
defined in
RFC 1918 ,
for example, 10.96.0.0/20 .
POD_ADDR_CIDR : A range of IPv4 addresses, in
CIDR format, to be used for Pods in the user cluster. The CIDR range must be
between /18 and /8, where /8 provides the most IP addresses. We recommend
that you use a range in the IP address space for private internets,
defined in
RFC 1918 ,
for example, 192.168.0.0/16 .
You must specify the following storage flags. The example command includes
typical values. For more information, see
Configure local storage .
--lvp-share-path : This is the host machine path where subdirectories can
be created. A local PersistentVolume (PV) is created for each subdirectory.
--lvp-share-storage-class : This is the StorageClass to use to create
persistent volumes. The StorageClass is created during cluster creation.
--lvp-node-mounts-config-path : This is the host machine path where mounted
disks can be discovered. A local PersistentVolume (PV) is created for each
mount.
--lvp-node-mounts-config-storage : The storage class that PVs are created
with during cluster creation.
For a complete list of the flags and their descriptions, see the
gcloud CLI reference .
The output from the command is similar to the following:
Waiting for operation [projects/example-project-12345/locations/us-west1/operations/operation-1679543737105-5f7893fd5bae9-942b3f97-75e59179] to complete.
In the example output, the string operation-1679543737105-5f7893fd5bae9-942b3f97-75e59179
is the OPERATION_ID of the long-running operation. You
can find out the status of the operation with the following command:
gcloud container bare-metal operations describe OPERATION_ID \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION
For more information, see
gcloud container bare-metal operations .
Fix preflight errors
Before creating the cluster, bmctl runs a series of preflight checks to
verify the configuration. If there is a problem with the configuration, the
gcloud ... create command exits with an error similar to:
ERROR: (gcloud.container.bare-metal.admin-clusters.create) Invalid resource state for "projects/694677185633/locations/us-west1/bareMetalAdminClusters/abm-cluster-1": cluster preflight checks failed
For example, assume that a preflight check failed because the control plane
node couldn't be reached. On the admin workstation, you will see something
similar to the following:
[2023-03-27 20:34:38+0000] Waiting for preflight check job to finish... OK
[2023-03-27 20:35:58+0000] - Validation Category: machines and network

[2023-03-27 20:35:58+0000] Error polling the preflight check abm-cluster-mar-27 in the cluster-abm-cluster-mar-27: preflight check failed
On the admin workstation, make sure that the bmctl register bootstrap
process is still running. If it isn't, re-run the command with the
same arguments and add the flag --reuse-bootstrap-cluster=true .
Run gcloud ... update to fix the invalid IP address:
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters update ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION \
--control-plane-node-configs 'node-ip= NEW_NODE_ID_ADDRESS '
For more information, see
gcloud container bare-metal admin-clusters update .
Details about the cluster creation process are output on your admin
workstation. If the preflight checks pass, you see something like the
following:
[2023-03-22 23:12:47+0000] Waiting for cluster kubeconfig to become ready OK
[2023-03-22 23:15:47+0000] Writing kubeconfig file

[2023-03-22 23:27:41+0000] Deleting membership... OK
[2023-03-22 23:27:42+0000] Deleting bootstrap cluster.
Connect to the admin cluster
The bmctl register bootstrap command creates a kubeconfig file for the admin
cluster on your admin workstation. The directory where the kubeconfig is
located and the filename are based on the admin cluster name as follows:
bmctl-workspace/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME / ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig
You need to restrict access to this kubeconfig because it contains
authentication credentials for the cluster.
If you want to use your Google identity to sign in to the cluster, you can
set up the connect gateway as follows:
On your admin workstation, set the KUBECONFIG environment variable:
export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/bmctl-workspace/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME / ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig
Set the current context in an environment variable:
export CONTEXT = " $( kubectl config current-context ) "
Run the following gcloud command. This command does the following:
Grants your user account the Kubernetes clusterrole/view
role on the cluster.
Configures the cluster so that you can run read-only kubectl commands on
your local computer without having to SSH to the admin workstation.
Replace GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL with the email address that
is associated with your Google Cloud account. For example:
--users=alex@example.com .
gcloud container fleet memberships generate-gateway-rbac \
--membership = ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--role = clusterrole/view \
--users = GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
--project = FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--kubeconfig = $KUBECONFIG \
--context = $CONTEXT \
--apply
The output of this command is similar to the following, which is
truncated for readability:
Validating input arguments.
Specified Cluster Role is: clusterrole/view
Generated RBAC policy is:
--------------------------------------------
...
Writing RBAC policy for user: GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL to cluster.
Successfully applied the RBAC policy to cluster.
With these RBAC policies in place, you can sign in to the cluster from the
console using your Google identity. Additionally, you can run
read-only kubectl commands on computers other than the admin workstation using
a special kubeconfig that routes requests through the
connect gateway.
Run the following command on a computer other than the admin workstation
to get the kubeconfig entry that can access the cluster through the
connect gateway.
gcloud container fleet memberships get-credentials ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project = FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID
The output is similar to the following:
Starting to build Gateway kubeconfig...
Current project_id: FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID
A new kubeconfig entry "connectgateway_ FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID _global_ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME " has been generated and set as the current context.
You can now run kubectl commands through the connect gateway:
kubectl get pods -A
What's next
Delete an admin cluster
Unregister an unavailable cluster
Add a user cluster
Manage clusters from the Google Cloud console
