IAM roles for Cloud Storage
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides information about Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and
permissions for Cloud Storage.
Predefined roles
The following table describes Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles
that are associated with Cloud Storage and lists the
permissions that are contained in each role. Unless otherwise noted, these roles
can be applied either to projects, buckets, or managed folders. However, you can
grant legacy roles only to individual buckets .
To learn how to control access to buckets, see
use IAM permissions . To learn how to control access to
managed folders, see use IAM for managed folders .
Role
Permissions
Storage Admin
( roles/ storage.admin )
Grants full control of objects and buckets.
When applied to an individual bucket , control applies only to
the specified bucket and objects within the bucket.

Basic roles
Note: You should minimize the use of basic roles if possible, and in production
environments, don't grant basic roles unless there is no alternative. Basic
roles contain a wide range of permissions across all Google Cloud services
and have potentially surprising behavior in Cloud Storage as described
in this section.
Basic roles are roles that existed prior to IAM. These roles have
unique characteristics:
Basic roles can only be granted for an entire project, not for individual
buckets within the project. Like other roles that you grant for a project,
basic roles apply to all buckets and objects in the project.
Basic roles contain additional permissions for other Google Cloud
services that are not covered in this section. See basic roles for a
general discussion of the permissions that basic roles grant.
Each basic role has a convenience value that lets you use the basic
role as if it were a group. When used in this way, any principal that has the
basic role is considered to be part of the group. Everyone in the group gets
additional access for resources based on the access the convenience value has.
Convenience values can be used when granting roles for buckets.
Convenience values can be used when setting ACLs on objects.
Basic roles don't intrinsically give all of the access to
Cloud Storage resources that their names imply. Instead, they give
a portion of the expected access intrinsically and the rest of the expected
access through the use of convenience values. Because convenience values can
be manually added or removed like any other IAM principal, it
is possible to revoke access that principals might otherwise expect to have.
For a discussion of additional access that principals with basic roles
typically gain due to convenience values, see modifiable behavior .
Intrinsic permissions
The following table describes the Cloud Storage permissions that are
always associated with each basic role.
Role
Description
Cloud Storage Permissions
Viewer ( roles/viewer )
Grants permission to list buckets in the project; view bucket
metadata when listing (excluding ACLs); and list and get HMAC keys in
the project.
storage.buckets.getIpFilter
storage.buckets.list
storage.hmacKeys.get
storage.hmacKeys.list
Editor ( roles/editor )
Grants permission to create, list, and delete buckets in the project;
view bucket metadata when listing (excluding ACLs); and control HMAC
keys in the project.
storage.buckets.create
storage.buckets.delete
storage.buckets.getIpFilter
storage.buckets.list
storage.hmacKeys.*
Owner ( roles/owner )
Grants permission to create, list, and delete buckets in the
project; view bucket metadata when listing (excluding ACLs); create,
delete, and list tag bindings; and control HMAC keys in the project; Enable, disable, update, and get the Storage Intelligence configuration on a project, a folder, or an organization.
Within Google Cloud more generally, principals with
this role can perform administrative tasks such as
changing principals' roles for the project or changing billing.
storage.buckets.create
storage.buckets.delete
storage.buckets.list
storage.buckets.createTagBinding
storage.buckets.deleteTagBinding
storage.buckets.getIpFilter
storage.buckets.listEffectiveTags
storage.buckets.listTagBindings
storage.buckets.setIpFilter
storage.hmacKeys.*
storage.intelligenceConfigs.get
storage.intelligenceConfigs.update
Modifiable behavior
Principals granted basic roles often have additional access to a project's
buckets and objects due to convenience values . When a bucket is created,
convenience values are granted certain bucket-level access, but you can later
edit your bucket IAM policies and your object ACLs to remove or
change the access.
When you create a bucket that has uniform bucket-level access enabled, the
following access is granted via convenience values:
Principals granted roles/viewer gain the roles/storage.legacyBucketReader
and roles/storage.legacyObjectReader roles for the bucket.
Principals granted roles/editor gain the roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner
and roles/storage.legacyObjectOwner roles for the bucket.
Principals granted roles/owner gain the roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner
and roles/storage.legacyObjectOwner roles for the bucket.
When you create a bucket that does not have uniform bucket-level access enabled, the
following access is granted using convenience values:
Principals granted roles/viewer gain the roles/storage.legacyBucketReader
role for the bucket.
Principals granted roles/editor gain the roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner
role for the bucket.
Principals granted roles/owner gain the roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner
role for the bucket.
Additionally, the bucket has a default object Access Control List (ACL) .
This default ACL is often applied to new objects in the bucket and often
grants additional access to convenience values.
Custom roles
You might want to define your own roles which contain bundles of permissions that
you specify. To support this, IAM offers custom roles .
What's next
Use IAM permissions to control access to buckets and
objects.
Learn about each IAM permission for Cloud Storage .
See available IAM references for Cloud Storage ,
such as which IAM permissions allow users to perform actions
with various tools and APIs.
