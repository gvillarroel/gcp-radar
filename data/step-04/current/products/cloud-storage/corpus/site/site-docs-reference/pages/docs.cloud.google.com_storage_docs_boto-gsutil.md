Boto configuration file
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Important: gsutil is not the recommended CLI for
Cloud Storage. Use
gcloud storage commands in the Google Cloud CLI instead.
This page describes how gsutil uses a boto configuration file and provides
a collaboration example that uses the file. The boto configuration file is
also used by boto, which is the Amazon S3 SDK for Python.
Note: boto3 is not supported with gsutil.
Configuration file overview
The boto configuration file contains values that control how gsutil behaves. For
example, the prefer_api variable determines which API gsutil preferentially
uses. Boto configuration file variables can be changed by editing the
configuration file directly. While most users won't need to edit these
variables, those who do typically do so for one of the following reasons:
Setting up gsutil to work through a proxy.
Using customer-managed or customer-supplied encryption keys .
Performing specialized customization of global gsutil behavior.
Location
The default location for the boto configuration file is in the user home
directory, ~/.boto, for Linux and macOS, and in %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%,
for Windows. You can get the location of the configuration file by running
the command gsutil version -l .
You can override where gsutil expects to find the config file by setting the
BOTO_CONFIG environment variable. You can also set up a path of boto
configuration files to load by setting the BOTO_PATH environment variable
using a : delimited path (or ; for Windows). For example, setting the
BOTO_PATH environment variable to:
/etc/projects/my_group_project.boto.cfg:/home/mylogin/.boto
causes gsutil to load each configuration file found in the path in order.
This is useful if you want to set up some shared configuration state among many
users. See the example of using the configuration file for such a
data sharing and collaboration scenario.
Structure
The configuration file contains a number of sections: [Credentials] , [Boto] ,
[GSUtil] , and [OAuth2] . The following are the
configuration settings, broken down by section. Their use is documented in the
boto configuration file itself, in comments preceding each setting:
[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key
gs_access_key_id
gs_host
gs_host_header
gs_json_host
gs_json_host_header
gs_json_port
gs_oauth2_refresh_token
gs_port
gs_secret_access_key
gs_service_client_id
gs_service_key_file
gs_service_key_file_password
s3_host
s3_host_header
s3_port
[Boto]
proxy
proxy_type
proxy_port
proxy_user
proxy_pass
proxy_rdns
http_socket_timeout
ca_certificates_file
https_validate_certificates
debug
max_retry_delay
num_retries
[GoogleCompute]
service_account
[GSUtil]
check_hashes
content_language
decryption_key1 ... 100
default_api_version
disable_analytics_prompt
encryption_key
json_api_version
max_upload_compression_buffer_size
parallel_composite_upload_component_size
parallel_composite_upload_threshold
sliced_object_download_component_size
sliced_object_download_max_components
sliced_object_download_threshold
parallel_process_count
parallel_thread_count
gzip_compression_level
prefer_api
resumable_threshold
resumable_tracker_dir (deprecated in 4.6, use state_dir)
rsync_buffer_lines
software_update_check_period
state_dir
tab_completion_time_logs
tab_completion_timeout
task_estimation_threshold
test_cmd_regional_bucket_location
test_notification_url
use_magicfile
test_hmac_service_account
test_hmac_alt_service_account
test_hmac_list_service_account
[OAuth2]
client_id
client_secret
oauth2_refresh_retries
provider_authorization_uri
provider_label
provider_token_uri
token_cache
When you edit the file, be careful not to mis-edit any of the setting names,
such as gs_access_key_id , and don't remove the section delimiters, such as
[Credentials] .
Updating to the latest configuration file
New configuration controllable features are added to the boto configuration file
over time, but most gsutil users create a configuration file once and then
keep it for a long time. This means that new features aren't apparent when you
update to a newer version of gsutil. If you want to get the latest configuration
file, which includes the latest settings and documentation, rename your current
file (e.g., to .boto_old ), run gcloud init (or if using a legacy stand-alone
version of gustil, gsutil config with the -a or -e flags), and then
transfer any configuration settings you want to keep from your old file into the
newly created file. Note, however, that if you're using OAuth2 credentials and
you go back through the OAuth2 configuration process, doing so invalidates your
previous OAuth2 credentials.
Example using the configuration file
In this example, a small company wants to use Cloud Storage as a storage
system for their employees. As the IT administrator, you create a project in the
Google Cloud console and create buckets for each employee. To make it easier
for employees to use Cloud Storage, you want to create and store
company-wide settings, such as a proxy configuration and parallel composite
upload thresholds, in a central file that employees can point to in their BOTO
configuration path. This eliminates the need for each employee to set the
shared parts of the configuration manually and allows you, as the administrator,
to easily change these shared configurations if necessary.
To accomplish this, perform the following steps:
Create a central boto configuration file that is readable by all employees.
This can be done by using gcloud init .
The boto configuration file might contain, for example:
[Boto]
proxy = yourproxy.com
proxy_port = 8080
proxy_type = http
[GSUtil]
parallel_composite_upload_threshold = 150M
Note: socks4 and socks5 proxies are also supported for proxy_type .
Instruct employees to install the Google Cloud CLI .
During installation, employees need to specify the project ID that the
company is using. They also need to generate individual authentication credentials
because you should never share authentication credentials centrally.
Instruct employees to add a BOTO_PATH environment variable.
The BOTO_PATH environment variable lists the path of the centrally located
configuration file, followed by the employee's local configuration file. For
example, if the central configuration file is located in the directory
centralhub/ , then for user jane , the BOTO_PATH environment variable
might be:
BOTO_PATH =/centralhub/boto.cfg:home/jane/.boto
When employees run gsutil, they will automatically use the configuration
specified in the central boto file. If necessary, the administrator can change
the proxy settings, parallel composite upload threshold, and other settings
in the central configuration file and have the changes reflected for all
employees using the central configuration file.
