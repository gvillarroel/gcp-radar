IAM permissions for gsutil commands
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The following table lists the Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
required to run each Cloud Storage gsutil command on a given resource.
IAM permissions are bundled together to make roles . You
grant roles to users and groups .
On this page, you can also find information about the following:
Using additional commands that only apply to buckets with
uniform bucket-level access disabled
Using wildcards and recursive flags
Using the -u flag to specify projects for billing
Using the -m flag to run operations in parallel

1 This permission is only required if the composed object has
the same name as an object that already exists in the bucket.
2 This permission is only required when the destination in the
command contains an object path.
3 This permission is only required if you use
parallel composite uploads or if you don't use the -n flag but insert an
object that has the same name as an object that already exists in the bucket.
4 This permission is only required if you do not have an existing
Cloud Storage service account associated with the project.
5 If you use gsutil kms encryption -k and your project's service
account does not have permission to access the requested Cloud KMS key,
gsutil runs gsutil kms authorize in order to grant your service account the
required permission.
6 This permission is only required if you want IAM
policies included in the details.
7 This permission is only required if you want IAM
policies included in the details, and it does not apply to buckets with
uniform bucket-level access enabled.
8 These permissions are not required if the topic already exists and
the relevant service account has access to it.
9 This permission is only required if you do not include a billing
project in your request. See Requester Pays Use and access requirements
for more information.
10 This permission is not required if the command does not change the
bucket setting.
11 This permission is only required if you use the -d flag or if
you insert an object that has the same name as, but different data than,
an object that already exists in the bucket.
Note: The permissions listed in the above table allow you to use the
commands. Some commands set bucket configurations that won't work without
additional permissions. For example, gsutil notification create
requires only storage.buckets.update to use, but you must have
additional permissions for the feature to work properly.
ACL-related methods
The following table lists the IAM permissions required to run
gsutil commands that apply specifically to the management of ACLs. These
commands only apply to buckets that have Uniform bucket-level access disabled.

storage.objects.setIamPolicy (for the destination bucket)
a This permission is only required when the destination in the
command contains an object path.
b This permission is only required if you use
parallel composite uploads or if you don't use the -n flag but insert an
object that has the same name as an object that already exists in the bucket.
c This permission is only required if you use the -d flag or if
you insert an object that has the same name as, but different data than,
an object that already exists in the bucket.
The -u top-level flag
If you use the -u global flag to specify a project that should be
billed for your request, you must have serviceusage.services.use permission
for the project you specify. The -u flag is used, for example, when accessing
a bucket with Requester Pays enabled.
Wildcards and recursive flags
If you use URI wildcards to select multiple objects in a command, you
must have storage.objects.list permission for the bucket containing the
objects. Similarly, if you use URI wildcards to select multiple buckets
in a command, you must have storage.buckets.list permission for the
project(s) containing the buckets.
If you use the recursive flags ( -r and -R ), you must have
storage.objects.list permission for the relevant bucket, in addition to
the permissions required for the specific command you are using.
The -m top-level flag
Normally, if you use a gsutil command that acts over multiple objects or
buckets, the command fails at the first error. However, when you use the
-m global flag, gsutil records any errors it encounters and
continues with the operation.
For example, say you try to perform an acl set command on a series of
objects, but you only have permission to do so on some of the objects. If
you do not use the -m flag, gsutil applies the ACLs successfully until it
reaches an object you do not have permission to apply an ACL to. At that point,
gsutil fails. If you use the -m flag, gsutil records the errors that arise
when it attempts to apply an ACL to an object for which you don't have
permission, but otherwise continues with the operation.
What's next
Assign IAM roles at the project and bucket level.
Review IAM roles that contain Cloud Storage permissions .
