Cloud Storage FUSE CLI reference
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the gcsfuse command options used to interact with
Cloud Storage FUSE . If you're using the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver to mount your
buckets to your local file system in Google Kubernetes Engine, see
Mount options for the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver .
The Cloud Storage FUSE command line interface (CLI), or gcsfuse CLI,
is used to mount Cloud Storage buckets as file systems on a local
machine.
Note: For specific high-performance machine types, some gcsfuse command
options are automatically set to specific values by default to maximize
performance. Values that are manually set at the time of mount will override
these defaults. For more information, see
Automated configuration values for high-performance machine types .
gcsfuse CLI command structure
The following example shows the structure of the gcsfuse command, including
required commands and optional gcsfuse options.
gcsfuse GLOBAL_OPTIONS BUCKET_NAME MOUNT_POINT
Replace the following:
GLOBAL_OPTIONS are the
gcsfuse options that control how the mount
is set up and how Cloud Storage FUSE behaves.
BUCKET_NAME is the name of the bucket to
mount. For example, my-mount-bucket . Optional. Exclude a bucket name from
this command to perform dynamic mounting.
MOUNT_POINT is the local directory where the bucket
will be mounted. For example, /path/to/mount/point .
gcsfuse CLI options
gcsfuse option
Description
Valid value
Default value
--anonymous-access
Disables authentication for requests. This option
should be set if you're using a custom endpoint that doesn't support
authentication. This option should also be set if
you're using Cloud Storage FUSE with public buckets.
Boolean value: true , false .
false
--app-name
The application name of the mount.
String value, for example: my-bucket-mount .
""
--billing-project
Specifies a project to use for billing when the mounted bucket is
accessed. This option is
often required
when mounting a bucket enabled with
Requester Pays .
String value representing a
project ID .
""
--cache-dir
Enables the file cache and specifies the directory for storing
file cache data.
Note : The Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver for Google Kubernetes Engine
uses a different method to enable file caching. To learn how to enable file
caching on Google Kubernetes Engine, see
Enable and use file caching .
A path, for example: /tmp/gcsfuse-cache-path . An empty value
indicates this option is disabled. This
gcsfuse option is disabled by default.
""
--client-protocol
Specifies the protocol used for communicating with the
Cloud Storage backend.
http1 for HTTP/1.1
http2 for HTTP/2
grpc for gRPC .
To use gRPC with Cloud Storage FUSE, we recommend using
Cloud Storage FUSE versions 2.10.0
or newer.
http1
--cloud-metrics-export-interval-secs
Exports metrics to Cloud Monitoring with the specified interval.
Note : Using this option
requires additional setup. For more information, see
Set up the Cloud Monitoring exporter .

The custom endpoint must support the equivalent resources and operations as
the Cloud Storage gRPC endpoint,
storage.googleapis.com:443 , or the Cloud Storage
JSON endpoint, https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1 .
If a custom endpoint isn't specified, Cloud Storage FUSE uses the global
Cloud Storage JSON endpoint.
If authentication isn't supported on the custom endpoint you specify, set
the --anonymous-access gcsfuse option to
true to bypass authentication.
An endpoint, for example: storage.googleapis.com:443 .
""
--debug_fuse (deprecated)

FUSE-related
debugging output. This option has been replaced by the
--log-severity gcsfuse option. To enable
debugging output, set the --log-severity gcsfuse
option to trace , which includes trace, debug, info, warning,
and error logs.
Boolean value: true , false .
false
--debug_gcs (deprecated)
Prints Cloud Storage request and timing information. This
gcsfuse option has been replaced by the

false
--enable-nonexistent-type-cache (deprecated)
Creates a type cache entry with the type NonexistentType
if a file isn't found in Cloud Storage. If the file gets created
in Cloud Storage but the NonexistentType entry for
the file is cached, then Cloud Storage FUSE cannot request that file until
the NonexistentType entry is removed from the type cache.
Boolean value: true , false .
false
--enable-streaming-writes
Controls the write path flow so that data is uploaded directly to
Cloud Storage as its written instead of fully staging the write locally
and uploading it upon close() or fsync() .
For more information about streaming writes, see
Cloud Storage FUSE semantics in the Cloud Storage FUSE GitHub documentation.
Boolean value: true , false .
true
--file-cache-max-size-mb

--file-cache-max-size-mb gcsfuse option,
you must first specify the
cache-dir gcsfuse option .
For Compute Engine VMs (including standalone Cloud Storage FUSE or
non-Google Kubernetes Engine based deployments), enabling cache-dir
automatically sets --file-cache-max-size-mb to
-1 .

to perform several random reads or partial reads.
Note : If you perform a partial read starting at offset
0 , Cloud Storage FUSE asynchronously downloads and caches
the full object.
Boolean value: true , false .
false
--file-cache-download-chunk-size-mb
Specifies the size of each read request in MiB that each
goroutine makes to
Cloud Storage when downloading the object into the file cache.

The severity level you want Cloud Storage FUSE to generate logs for. The
severity levels are ordered from lowest severity to highest severity. For
example, when you specify warning , Cloud Storage FUSE generates logs
for warnings and errors. Generally, we recommend using the info
severity level.
Note: If you specify --debug_mutex as part of your
command, the severity level is automatically set to trace
and overrides log-severity .
Note: Using either the trace or debug
severity levels when file caching is enabled can result in performance
degradation due to logging overhead and should only be used temporarily
such as during troubleshooting.
off : disables all logging.
error : contains messages about serious issues that prevent
Cloud Storage FUSE from completing an operation, or indicate a failure such as
mount failures, permission errors, and critical input/output (I/O) errors.
warning : contains messages indicating potential issues
that aren't critical but can lead to issues if not addressed. Potential
issues include non-fatal connection issues, deprecation warnings, resource
contention that might cause slight performance degradation, and retries for
transient failures. This severity level also includes information provided
in the error severity level.
info : contains general logging information such as startup
and shutdown messages, or information about successful mount operations,
progress updates, and configuration settings. This severity
level also includes information about the warning and
error severity levels.
debug : contains logging information such as startup
and shutdown messages, or information about successful mount operations,
progress updates, and configuration settings. This severity level also
includes the information provided in the info ,
warning , and error severity levels.
trace : contains granular details about each Cloud Storage FUSE
operation and function call, outlining the gcsfuse interaction
with the kernel FUSE driver and Cloud Storage. This severity level also
includes the details provided in debug , info ,
