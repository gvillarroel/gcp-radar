if_metageneration_not_match = None ,
timeout = 60 ,
retry = google . api_core . retry . retry_unary . Retry ,
)
Delete this bucket.
The bucket must be empty in order to submit a delete request. If
force=True is passed, this will first attempt to delete all the
objects / blobs in the bucket (i.e. try to empty the bucket).
If the bucket doesn't exist, this will raise
xref_NotFound. If the bucket is not empty
(and force=False ), will raise xref_Conflict.
If force=True and the bucket contains more than 256 objects / blobs
this will cowardly refuse to delete the objects (or the bucket). This
is to prevent accidental bucket deletion and to prevent extremely long
runtime of this method. Also note that force=True is not supported
in a Batch context.
If user_project is set, bills the API request to that project.

(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: configuring_timeouts
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry or google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. A None value will disable retries. A google.api_core.retry.Retry value will enable retries, and the object will define retriable response codes and errors and configure backoff and timeout options. A google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy value wraps a Retry object and activates it only if certain conditions are met. This class exists to provide safe defaults for RPC calls that are not technically safe to retry normally (due to potential data duplication or other side-effects) but become safe to retry if a condition such as if_generation_match is set. See the retry.py source code and docstrings in this package ( google.cloud.storage.retry ) for information on retry types and how to configure them.
Exceptions
Type
Description
NotFound
Raises a NotFound if the blob isn't found. To suppress the exception, use delete_blobs by passing a no-op on_error callback.

Deletes a list of blobs from the current bucket.
Uses delete_blob to delete each individual blob.

Parameters
Name
Description
client
Client or NoneType
the client to use. If not passed, falls back to the client stored on the current object.
projection
str
(Optional) If used, must be 'full' or 'noAcl'. Defaults to 'noAcl' . Specifies the set of properties to return.
timeout
float or tuple
(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: configuring_timeouts
if_etag_match
Union[str, Set[str]]
(Optional) Make the operation conditional on whether the bucket's current ETag matches the given value.
if_etag_not_match
Union[str, Set[str]])
(Optional) Make the operation conditional on whether the bucket's current ETag does not match the given value.
if_metageneration_match
long
(Optional) Make the operation conditional on whether the bucket's current metageneration matches the given value.
if_metageneration_not_match
long
(Optional) Make the operation conditional on whether the bucket's current metageneration does not match the given value.
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry or google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. See: configuring_retries
soft_deleted
bool
(Optional) If True, looks for a soft-deleted bucket. Will only return the bucket metadata if the bucket exists and is in a soft-deleted state. The bucket generation must be set if soft_deleted is set to True. See: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/soft-delete
rename_blob
rename_blob (
blob ,
new_name ,
client = None ,
if_generation_match = None ,
if_generation_not_match = None ,
if_metageneration_match = None ,
if_metageneration_not_match = None ,
if_source_generation_match = None ,
if_source_generation_not_match = None ,
if_source_metageneration_match = None ,
if_source_metageneration_not_match = None ,
timeout = 60 ,
retry = google . cloud . storage . retry . ConditionalRetryPolicy ,
)
Rename the given blob using copy and delete operations.
If user_project is set, bills the API request to that project.
Effectively, copies blob to the same bucket with a new name, then
deletes the blob.
Warning:
This method will first duplicate the data and then delete the
old blob. This means that with very large objects renaming
could be a very (temporarily) costly or a very slow operation.
If you need more control over the copy and deletion, instead
use <xref uid="google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob">google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob</xref>.copy_to and
<xref uid="google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob.delete">google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob.delete</xref> directly.
Also note that this method is not fully supported in a
Batch context.
Parameters

blob
Blob
The blob to be renamed.
new_name
str
The new name for this blob.
client
Client or NoneType
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the client stored on the current bucket.
if_generation_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-generation-match Note that the generation to be matched is that of the destination blob.
if_generation_not_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-generation-not-match Note that the generation to be matched is that of the destination blob.
if_metageneration_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-metageneration-match Note that the metageneration to be matched is that of the destination blob.
if_metageneration_not_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-metageneration-not-match Note that the metageneration to be matched is that of the destination blob.
if_source_generation_match
long
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object's generation matches the given value. Also used in the (implied) delete request.
if_source_generation_not_match
long
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object's generation does not match the given value. Also used in the (implied) delete request.

(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object's current metageneration matches the given value. Also used in the (implied) delete request.
if_source_metageneration_not_match
long
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object's current metageneration does not match the given value. Also used in the (implied) delete request.
timeout
float or tuple
(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: configuring_timeouts
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry or google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. The default value is DEFAULT_RETRY_IF_GENERATION_SPECIFIED , a conditional retry policy which will only enable retries if if_generation_match or generation is set, in order to ensure requests are idempotent before retrying them. Change the value to DEFAULT_RETRY or another google.api_core.retry.Retry object to enable retries regardless of generation precondition setting. See Configuring Retries .
