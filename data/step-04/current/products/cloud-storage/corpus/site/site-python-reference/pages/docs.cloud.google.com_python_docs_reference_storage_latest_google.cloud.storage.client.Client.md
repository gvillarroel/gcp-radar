Client (
project = object ,
credentials = None ,
_http = None ,
client_info = None ,
client_options = None ,
use_auth_w_custom_endpoint = True ,
extra_headers = {},
* ,
api_key = None
)
Client to bundle configuration needed for API requests.
Parameters
Name
Description
project
str or None
the project which the client acts on behalf of. Will be passed when creating a topic. If not passed, falls back to the default inferred from the environment.
credentials
google.auth.credentials.Credentials
(Optional) The OAuth2 Credentials to use for this client. If not passed (and if no _http object is passed), falls back to the default inferred from the environment.
_http
requests.Session
(Optional) HTTP object to make requests. Can be any object that defines request() with the same interface as requests.Session.request . If not passed, an _http object is created that is bound to the credentials for the current object. This parameter should be considered private, and could change in the future.
client_info
google.api_core.client_info.ClientInfo
The client info used to send a user-agent string along with API requests. If None , then default info will be used. Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing your own library or partner tool.
client_options
google.api_core.client_options.ClientOptions or dict
(Optional) Client options used to set user options on the client. A non-default universe domain or api endpoint should be set through client_options.
use_auth_w_custom_endpoint
bool
(Optional) Whether authentication is required under custom endpoints. If false, uses AnonymousCredentials and bypasses authentication. Defaults to True. Note this is only used when a custom endpoint is set in conjunction.
extra_headers
dict
(Optional) Custom headers to be sent with the requests attached to the client. For example, you can add custom audit logging headers.
api_key
string
(Optional) An API key. Mutually exclusive with any other credentials. This parameter is an alias for setting client_options.api_key and will supercede any api key set in the client_options parameter.

This will not make an HTTP request; it simply instantiates
a batch object owned by this client.
Parameter
Name
Description
raise_exception
bool
(Optional) Defaults to True. If True, instead of adding exceptions to the list of return responses, the final exception will be raised. Note that exceptions are unwrapped after all operations are complete in success or failure, and only the last exception is raised.
Returns
Type
Description
Batch
The batch object created.
bucket
bucket ( bucket_name , user_project = None , generation = None )

user_project
str
(Optional) The project ID to be billed for API requests made via created bucket.
location
str
(Optional) The location of the bucket. If not passed, the default location, US, will be used. If specifying a dual-region, data_locations should be set in conjunction. See: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations

(Optional) Name of predefined ACL to apply to bucket's objects. See: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists#predefined-acl
enable_object_retention
bool
(Optional) Whether object retention should be enabled on this bucket. See: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-lock
timeout
Optional[Union[float, Tuple[float, float]]]

A google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy value wraps a Retry object and activates it only if certain conditions are met. This class exists to provide safe defaults for RPC calls that are not technically safe to retry normally (due to potential data duplication or other side-effects) but become safe to retry if a condition such as if_metageneration_match is set. See the retry.py source code and docstrings in this package ( google.cloud.storage.retry ) for information on retry types and how to configure them.
