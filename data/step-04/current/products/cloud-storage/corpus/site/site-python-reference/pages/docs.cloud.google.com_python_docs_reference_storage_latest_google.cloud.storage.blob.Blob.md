Methods
Blob
Blob (
name ,
bucket ,
chunk_size = None ,
encryption_key = None ,
kms_key_name = None ,
generation = None ,
)
property name
Get the blob's name.
compose
compose (
sources ,
client = None ,
timeout = 60 ,
if_generation_match = None ,
if_metageneration_match = None ,
if_source_generation_match = None ,
retry = google . cloud . storage . retry . ConditionalRetryPolicy ,
)
Concatenate source blobs into this one.
If user_project is set on the bucket, bills the API request
to that project.
See API reference docs
and a code sample .
Parameters
Name
Description
sources
list of Blob
Blobs whose contents will be composed into this blob.
client
Client
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the client stored on the blob's bucket.
timeout
float or tuple
(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: configuring_timeouts
if_generation_match
long
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the destination object's current generation matches the given value. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there are no live versions of the object. Note: In a previous version, this argument worked identically to the if_source_generation_match argument. For backwards-compatibility reasons, if a list is passed in, this argument will behave like if_source_generation_match and also issue a DeprecationWarning.
if_metageneration_match
long
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the destination object's current metageneration matches the given value. If a list of long is passed in, no match operation will be performed. (Deprecated: type(list of long) is supported for backwards-compatability reasons only.)
if_source_generation_match
list of long
(Optional) Makes the operation conditional on whether the current generation of each source blob matches the corresponding generation. The list must match sources item-to-item.
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry or google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. The default value is DEFAULT_RETRY_IF_GENERATION_SPECIFIED , a conditional retry policy which will only enable retries if if_generation_match or generation is set, in order to ensure requests are idempotent before retrying them. Change the value to DEFAULT_RETRY or another google.api_core.retry.Retry object to enable retries regardless of generation precondition setting. See Configuring Retries .
create_resumable_upload_session
create_resumable_upload_session (
content_type = None ,
size = None ,
origin = None ,
client = None ,
timeout = 60 ,
checksum = "auto" ,
predefined_acl = None ,
if_generation_match = None ,
if_generation_not_match = None ,
if_metageneration_match = None ,
if_metageneration_not_match = None ,
retry = google . api_core . retry . retry_unary . Retry ,
)
Create a resumable upload session.
Resumable upload sessions allow you to start an upload session from
one client and complete the session in another. This method is called
by the initiator to set the metadata and limits. The initiator then
passes the session URL to the client that will upload the binary data.
The client performs a PUT request on the session URL to complete the
upload. This process allows untrusted clients to upload to an
access-controlled bucket.
For more details, see the
documentation on signed URLs .
The content type of the upload will be determined in order
of precedence:
The value passed in to this method (if not :data: None )
The value stored on the current blob
The default value ('application/octet-stream')
Note:
The effect of uploading to an existing blob depends on the
"versioning" and "lifecycle" policies defined on the blob's
bucket. In the absence of those policies, upload will
overwrite any existing contents.
See the object versioning
and lifecycle
API documents for details.
If encryption_key is set, the blob will be encrypted with
a customer-supplied
encryption key.
If user_project is set on the bucket, bills the API request
to that project.
Parameters
Name
Description
size
int
(Optional) The maximum number of bytes that can be uploaded using this session. If the size is not known when creating the session, this should be left blank.
content_type
str
(Optional) Type of content being uploaded.
origin
str
(Optional) If set, the upload can only be completed by a user-agent that uploads from the given origin. This can be useful when passing the session to a web client.
client
Client
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the client stored on the blob's bucket.
timeout
float or tuple
(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: configuring_timeouts
checksum
str
(Optional) The type of checksum to compute to verify the integrity of the object. After the upload is complete, the server-computed checksum of the resulting object will be checked and google.cloud.storage.exceptions.DataCorruption will be raised on a mismatch. On a validation failure, the client will attempt to delete the uploaded object automatically. Supported values are "md5", "crc32c", "auto" and None. The default is "auto", which will try to detect if the C extension for crc32c is installed and fall back to md5 otherwise.
predefined_acl
str
(Optional) Predefined access control list
if_generation_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-generation-match
if_generation_not_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-generation-not-match
if_metageneration_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-metageneration-match
if_metageneration_not_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-metageneration-not-match
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry or google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. A None value will disable retries. A google.api_core.retry.Retry value will enable retries, and the object will define retriable response codes and errors and configure backoff and timeout options. A google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy value wraps a Retry object and activates it only if certain conditions are met. This class exists to provide safe defaults for RPC calls that are not technically safe to retry normally (due to potential data duplication or other side-effects) but become safe to retry if a condition such as if_generation_match is set. See the retry.py source code and docstrings in this package ( google.cloud.storage.retry ) for information on retry types and how to configure them.
Exceptions
Type
Description
GoogleCloudError
if the session creation response returns an error status.
Returns
Type
Description
str
The resumable upload session URL. The upload can be completed by making an HTTP PUT request with the file's contents.

retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry or google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. A None value will disable retries. A google.api_core.retry.Retry value will enable retries, and the object will define retriable response codes and errors and configure backoff and timeout options. A google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy value wraps a Retry object and activates it only if certain conditions are met. This class exists to provide safe defaults for RPC calls that are not technically safe to retry normally (due to potential data duplication or other side-effects) but become safe to retry if a condition such as if_metageneration_match is set. See the retry.py source code and docstrings in this package ( google.cloud.storage.retry ) for information on retry types and how to configure them.
single_shot_download
bool
(Optional) If true, download the object in a single request. Caution: Enabling this will increase the memory overload for your application. Please enable this as per your use case.

Note:
If the server-set property, media_link , is not yet
initialized, makes an additional API request to load it.
For more fine-grained control over the download process, check out
google-resumable-media .
For example, this library allows downloading parts of a blob rather than the whole thing.
If user_project is set on the bucket, bills the API request
to that project.

Note:
If you are on Google Compute Engine, you can't generate a signed
URL using GCE service account.
If you'd like to be able to generate a signed URL from GCE,
you can use a standard service account from a JSON file rather
than a GCE service account.

This is particularly useful if you don't want publicly
accessible blobs, but don't want to require users to explicitly
log in.
If bucket_bound_hostname is set as an argument of api_access_endpoint ,
https works only if using a CDN .
Parameters

get_iam_policy
get_iam_policy (
client = None ,
requested_policy_version = None ,
timeout = 60 ,
retry = google . api_core . retry . retry_unary . Retry ,
)
Retrieve the IAM policy for the object.
Note:
Blob- / object-level IAM support does not yet exist and methods
currently call an internal ACL backend not providing any utility
beyond the blob's acl at this time. The API may be enhanced
in the future and is currently undocumented. Use acl for
managing object access control.

int or NoneType
(Optional) The version of IAM policies to request. If a policy with a condition is requested without setting this, the server will return an error. This must be set to a value of 3 to retrieve IAM policies containing conditions. This is to prevent client code that isn't aware of IAM conditions from interpreting and modifying policies incorrectly. The service might return a policy with version lower than the one that was requested, based on the feature syntax in the policy fetched.

open
open (
mode = "r" ,
chunk_size = None ,
ignore_flush = None ,
encoding = None ,
errors = None ,
newline = None ,
** kwargs
)
Create a file handler for file-like I/O to or from this blob.
This method can be used as a context manager, just like Python's
built-in 'open()' function.
While reading, as with other read methods, if blob.generation is not set
the most recent blob generation will be used. Because the file-like IO
reader downloads progressively in chunks, this could result in data from
multiple versions being mixed together. If this is a concern, use
either bucket.get_blob(), or blob.reload(), which will download the
latest generation number and set it; or, if the generation is known, set
it manually, for instance with bucket.blob(generation=123456).
Checksumming (hashing) to verify data integrity is disabled for reads
using this feature because reads are implemented using request ranges,
which do not provide checksums to validate. See
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hashes-etags for details.
See a code sample .
Keyword arguments to pass to the underlying API calls.
For both uploads and downloads, the following arguments are
supported:
if_generation_match
if_generation_not_match
if_metageneration_match
if_metageneration_not_match
timeout
retry
For downloads only, the following additional arguments are supported:
raw_download
single_shot_download
For uploads only, the following additional arguments are supported:
content_type
predefined_acl
checksum
Parameters
Name
Description
mode
str
(Optional) A mode string, as per standard Python open() semantics.The first character must be 'r', to open the blob for reading, or 'w' to open it for writing. The second character, if present, must be 't' for (unicode) text mode, or 'b' for bytes mode. If the second character is omitted, text mode is the default.
chunk_size
long
(Optional) For reads, the minimum number of bytes to read at a time. If fewer bytes than the chunk_size are requested, the remainder is buffered. For writes, the maximum number of bytes to buffer before sending data to the server, and the size of each request when data is sent. Writes are implemented as a "resumable upload", so chunk_size for writes must be exactly a multiple of 256KiB as with other resumable uploads. The default is 40 MiB.
ignore_flush
bool
(Optional) For non text-mode writes, makes flush() do nothing instead of raising an error. flush() without closing is not supported by the remote service and therefore calling it normally results in io.UnsupportedOperation. However, that behavior is incompatible with some consumers and wrappers of file objects in Python, such as zipfile.ZipFile or io.TextIOWrapper. Setting ignore_flush will cause flush() to successfully do nothing, for compatibility with those contexts. The correct way to actually flush data to the remote server is to close() (using a context manager, such as in the example, will cause this to happen automatically).
encoding
str
(Optional) For text mode only, the name of the encoding that the stream will be decoded or encoded with. If omitted, it defaults to locale.getpreferredencoding(False).
errors
str
(Optional) For text mode only, an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled. Pass 'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error (the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.) Other more rarely-used options are also available; see the Python 'io' module documentation for 'io.TextIOWrapper' for a complete list.
newline
str
(Optional) For text mode only, controls how line endings are handled. It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'. If None, reads use "universal newline mode" and writes use the system default. See the Python 'io' module documentation for 'io.TextIOWrapper' for details.

Change the value to DEFAULT_RETRY or another google.api_core.retry.Retry object to enable retries regardless of generation precondition setting. See Configuring Retries .
upload_from_file
upload_from_file (
file_obj ,
rewind = False ,
size = None ,
content_type = None ,
client = None ,
predefined_acl = None ,
if_generation_match = None ,
if_generation_not_match = None ,
if_metageneration_match = None ,
if_metageneration_not_match = None ,
timeout = 60 ,
checksum = "auto" ,
retry = google . api_core . retry . retry_unary . Retry ,
crc32c_checksum_value = None ,
)
Upload the contents of this blob from a file-like object.
The content type of the upload will be determined in order
of precedence:
The value passed in to this method (if not :data: None )
The value stored on the current blob
The default value ('application/octet-stream')
Note:
The effect of uploading to an existing blob depends on the
"versioning" and "lifecycle" policies defined on the blob's
bucket. In the absence of those policies, upload will
overwrite any existing contents.
See the object versioning
and lifecycle
API documents for details.
If the size of the data to be uploaded exceeds 8 MB a resumable media
request will be used, otherwise the content and the metadata will be
uploaded in a single multipart upload request.
For more fine-grained over the upload process, check out
google-resumable-media .
If user_project is set on the bucket, bills the API request
to that project.
Parameters
Name
Description
file_obj
file
A file handle opened in binary mode for reading.
rewind
bool
If True, seek to the beginning of the file handle before writing the file to Cloud Storage.
size
int
The number of bytes to be uploaded (which will be read from file_obj ). If not provided, the upload will be concluded once file_obj is exhausted.
content_type
str
(Optional) Type of content being uploaded.
client
Client
(Optional) The client to use. If not passed, falls back to the client stored on the blob's bucket.
predefined_acl
str
(Optional) Predefined access control list
if_generation_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-generation-match
if_generation_not_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-generation-not-match
if_metageneration_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-metageneration-match
if_metageneration_not_match
long
(Optional) See :ref: using-if-metageneration-not-match
timeout
float or tuple
(Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the server response. See: configuring_timeouts
checksum
str
(Optional) The type of checksum to compute to verify the integrity of the object. If the upload is completed in a single request, the checksum will be entirely precomputed and the remote server will handle verification and error handling. If the upload is too large and must be transmitted in multiple requests, the checksum will be incrementally computed and the client will handle verification and error handling, raising google.cloud.storage.exceptions.DataCorruption on a mismatch and attempting to delete the corrupted file. Supported values are "md5", "crc32c", "auto" and None. The default is "auto", which will try to detect if the C extension for crc32c is installed and fall back to md5 otherwise.
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry or google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy
(Optional) How to retry the RPC. A None value will disable retries. A google.api_core.retry.Retry value will enable retries, and the object will define retriable response codes and errors and configure backoff and timeout options. A google.cloud.storage.retry.ConditionalRetryPolicy value wraps a Retry object and activates it only if certain conditions are met. This class exists to provide safe defaults for RPC calls that are not technically safe to retry normally (due to potential data duplication or other side-effects) but become safe to retry if a condition such as if_generation_match is set. See the retry.py source code and docstrings in this package ( google.cloud.storage.retry ) for information on retry types and how to configure them.
crc32c_checksum_value
str
(Optional) This should be the checksum of the entire contents of file_obj . Applicable while uploading object greater than _MAX_MULTIPART_SIZE bytes. It can be obtained by running gcloud storage hash /path/to/your/file or .. code-block:: python import google_crc32c import base64 data = b"Hello, world!" crc32c_int = google_crc32c.value(data) crc32c_hex = f"{crc32c_int:08x}" crc32c_bytes = crc32c_int.to_bytes(4, "big") base64_encoded = base64.b64encode(crc32c_bytes) crc32c_base64 = base64_encoded.decode("utf-8") print(crc32c_base64) Above code block prints 8 char string of base64 encoded big-endian bytes of 32 bit CRC32c integer. More details on CRC32c can be found in Appendix B: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4960#appendix-B and base64: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4
