Managing gcloud CLI components
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Components are the installable parts of the Google Cloud CLI. A component
can be a command-line tool ( gcloud , bq , and gsutil ), a set of
gcloud CLI commands at the Alpha, Beta, or Preview
release levels , or a package
that contains dependencies used by a tool in the gcloud CLI.
The most commonly-used components are installed by default. If you run a
gcloud alpha , gcloud beta , or gcloud preview command interactively and the alpha , beta , or preview
component is not installed, the gcloud CLI asks you whether you
want to install it. An affirmative response installs the component and then runs
the command. Other components are installed on-demand by the
gcloud CLI when you run commands that require them.

Default components
When you install the gcloud CLI, the following components are
installed by default:
ID
Name
Description
gcloud
Default gcloud CLI commands
Tool for interacting with Google Cloud. Only commands
at the General Availability release level are installed with
this component. You must separately install the gcloud alpha
Commands, gcloud beta Commands, and/or gcloud preview Commands components if you want to
use commands at other release levels.
bq
BigQuery command-line tool
Tool for working with data in BigQuery
gsutil
Legacy tool for performing Cloud Storage tasks. Use
gcloud storage commands
instead.
core
gcloud CLI core libraries
Libraries used internally by the gcloud CLI tools.
Alpha, beta, and preview components
The gcloud CLI provides components that contain
gcloud CLI alpha, beta, and preview commands. These components aren't
installed by default, but you can install them manually at any time after the
initial gcloud CLI installation. These components are:
ID
Name
Description
alpha
gcloud CLI alpha commands
gcloud CLI commands at the alpha release level.
beta
gcloud CLI beta commands
gcloud CLI commands at the beta release level.
preview
gcloud CLI preview commands
gcloud CLI commands at the preview release level.
gcloud CLI commands at the General Availability release level are
part of the gcloud CLI component and are installed automatically
when you install the gcloud CLI.
A list of all available additional components and
external package managers , which aren't installed
by default, appears below.
Managing gcloud CLI components
You can list, install, update, and remove gcloud CLI components to
suit your needs.
Note: These instructions won't work if you have installed
gcloud CLI using a package manager such as APT or yum because
gcloud CLI component manager is disabled when using that method of
installation. Use these
packages instead.
Caution: When modifying your installation, the current directory of your
terminal must be outside the google-cloud-cli directory of the
gcloud CLI installation. On Windows, you will need to open your
terminal as an Administrator if you have performed an All Users installation.
Listing components
To see a list of components that are available and currently installed,
run gcloud components list :
gcloud components list
The following sample isn't a complete listing of all available components. To
view the latest component offerings, update your gcloud CLI
installation and then run
gcloud components list .

Installing components
To install a component at the current version of your gcloud CLI
installation, run
gcloud components install :
gcloud components install [COMPONENT-ID]
The gcloud CLI installs the specified component.
For example, if you want to install the kubectl command:
gcloud components install kubectl
Updating components
Use the gcloud components update
command to update all installed components to the latest available version of
gcloud CLI:
gcloud components update
If you have an older version of the gcloud CLI installed, the
gcloud CLI updates all the installed components.
If you need to revert to a previously known good version and installed the
gcloud CLI directly (outside of a package manager, including using
the interactive installer, static versions, Windows installer, or Homebrew),
use gcloud components update to revert to the specified version:
gcloud components update --version VERSION
For downgrading versions of the gcloud CLI installed using a package
manager, refer to these instructions for specifying versions when downloading
using apt-get or yum .
Removing components
Use the gcloud components remove
command to remove a specified component by its ID:
gcloud components remove [COMPONENT-ID]
You can re-install a component using the gcloud components install command
at any time.
Additional components
Additional components that contain dependencies for gcloud CLI
commands are also available in the gcloud CLI, but aren't installed by
default. For an exhaustive list of components, run
gcloud components list .
Additional components that can be installed are marked with the status
Not Installed .
External package managers
If you installed the gcloud CLI through the apt
or yum package managers, you can also install
additional gcloud CLI components using those same package managers. If your
package manager cannot find these packages, read the
installing with apt or
installing with yum guides to learn how to configure
https://packages.cloud.google.com/ as a package source.
