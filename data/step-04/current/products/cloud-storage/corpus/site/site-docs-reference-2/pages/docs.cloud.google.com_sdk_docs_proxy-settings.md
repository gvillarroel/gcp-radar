Configuring the gcloud CLI for use behind a proxy/firewall
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
If you are behind a corporate proxy or firewall, the Google Cloud CLI might not
be able to access the internet with its default settings.
Installing the gcloud CLI
The interactive gcloud CLI installers download components from the
internet as part of the installation process, which might not work correctly if
you're behind a proxy or firewall.
For a simpler installation process when proxy configuration is necessary, use
one of the self-contained versioned archives
to install the gcloud CLI. All previous versions of the
gcloud CLI are also available to download from the
downloads archive .
Proxy configuration
Note: The gcloud CLI respects the http_proxy , https_proxy , and
no_proxy environment variables set in your proxy configuration; these control
the proxy server used for plain HTTP connections, the proxy server used for
HTTPS connections (typically more relevant for most gcloud CLI
commands), and the domains not to proxy, respectively. Configure your gcloud
proxy settings only if you would like to use a different proxy. If gcloud
proxy settings are set, they override existing proxy configuration; this
includes ignoring no_proxy . Tip: If you see warnings or errors related to the https_proxy environment
variable, it may be because you have specified e.g. https_proxy=https://...
instead of https_proxy=http://... . The latter is needed since the
gcloud CLI only supports HTTP proxies. Earlier versions of the
gcloud CLI silently ignored this difference and would always
attempt to contact the proxy via HTTP even if the proxy URL specified HTTPS.
After you have the gcloud CLI installed, proxy settings can be
configured using gcloud CLI properties by running gcloud config .
For more information on what gcloud CLI properties are and how to use
them, refer to the
properties page.
To start, set the type of proxy you are using and the address and port on which
to reach it:
gcloud config set proxy / type [ PROXY_TYPE ]
gcloud config set proxy / address [ PROXY_IP_ADDRESS ]
gcloud config set proxy / port [ PROXY_PORT ]
The gcloud CLI supports the following values for PROXY_TYPE : http ,
http_no_tunnel , socks4 , socks5
PROXY_IP_ADDRESS is the hostname or IP address of where the proxy can be
reached.
PROXY_PORT is the port the proxy is running on (e.g. 8080 ).
For an authenticated proxy, you will need to set your proxy username and
password using properties as follows:
gcloud config set proxy / username [ USERNAME ]
gcloud config set proxy / password [ PASSWORD ]
Alternatively, to avoid having the proxy credentials recorded in any logs (such
as shell history or gcloud CLI logs) or in the
gcloud CLI configuration file, you can set the properties using
environment variables, as shown in the following sample:
export CLOUDSDK_PROXY_USERNAME [ USERNAME ]
export CLOUDSDK_PROXY_PASSWORD [ PASSWORD ]
The gcloud CLI won't store these values. This way, the credentials
can be stored in an encrypted file locally, or they can be stored in a secure
network location and retrieved when necessary.
If you are behind a proxy and you receive SSL handshake errors, it's likely
that your proxy is a man-in-the-middle proxy which uses a custom CA. You need
to set the following property to point to your custom CA file:
gcloud config set core / custom_ca_certs_file [ PATH_TO_CUSTOM_CA ]
For a full description of related properties, run
gcloud topic configurations
or gcloud config set
and look for proxy under the Available properties section.
