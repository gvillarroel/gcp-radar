Using the Google Cloud CLI installer
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Google Cloud CLI provides an installer for each supported platform and can
be deployed interactively or non-interactively.
Interactive installation
The installer lets you download, install, and set up the latest version of
Google Cloud CLI in an interactive mode. When you run the installer,
it downloads Google Cloud CLI components and installs them on the local
system. It also performs additional setup tasks like adding gcloud CLI
components to your PATH and enabling command completion in your shell.
Note: The installer is designed to make it easy for a
user to install the latest version of Google Cloud CLI. If you want to use a
script to install a specific version in non-interactive mode —
for example, to install the same version automatically every time you build a
production system — use a
versioned archive of
the Google Cloud CLI.
Linux and macOS
Run the following command:
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
When prompted, choose a location on your file system for the
google-cloud-sdk subdirectory. The default is your Home directory.
To send anonymous usage statistics to help improve gcloud CLI,
answer Y when prompted.
To add gcloud CLI command-line tools to your PATH and enable command
completion, answer Y when prompted.
Restart your shell:
exec -l $SHELL
Run gcloud init to
initialize, authorize, and configure the gcloud CLI.
Windows (Installer)
The Google Cloud CLI on Windows requires Windows 8.1 and later, or Windows Server 2012 and later.
Download the Google Cloud CLI installer .
Alternatively, open a PowerShell terminal and run the following PowerShell commands:
( New-Object Net.WebClient ) .DownloadFile ( "https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe" , " $env :Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe" )
& $env :Temp \G oogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe
Launch the installer and follow the prompts. The installer is signed by Google LLC.
If you're using a screen reader, check the Turn on screen reader mode checkbox. This
option configures gcloud to use status trackers instead of unicode spinners,
display progress as a percentage, and flatten tables. For more information, see the
Accessibility features guide .
Google Cloud CLI requires Python; supported versions are Python 3.10 to 3.14. By
default, the Windows version of Google Cloud CLI comes bundled with Python 3. To use
Google Cloud CLI your operating system must be able to run a supported version of Python.
The installer installs all necessary dependencies, including the needed Python version.
While Google Cloud CLI installs and manages Python 3 by default, you can use an existing
Python installation if necessary by unchecking the option to Install Bundled Python.
See gcloud topic startup to
learn how to use an existing Python installation.
After installation is complete, the installer gives you the option to create Start Menu
and Desktop shortcuts, start the Google Cloud CLI shell, and configure the
gcloud CLI. Leave the options to start the shell and configure
your installation selected. The installer starts a terminal window and runs the
gcloud init command to initialize,
authorize, and configure the gcloud CLI.
The default installation doesn't include the App Engine extensions required to deploy an
application using gcloud commands. These components can be installed using the
gcloud CLI component manager .
Troubleshooting tips
If your installation is unsuccessful
due to the find command not being recognized, ensure your PATH
environment variable is set to include the folder containing find . Usually,
this is C:\WINDOWS\system32; .
If you uninstalled the gcloud CLI, you must reboot your
system before installing the gcloud CLI again.
If unzipping fails, run the installer as an administrator.
Windows (Zip)
You can also install the latest version from a downloaded
.zip file:
Download
google-cloud-sdk.zip
and extract its contents. (Right click on the downloaded file and
select Extract All .)
Launch the google-cloud-sdk\install.bat script and follow
the installation prompts.
When the installation finishes, restart the command prompt
( cmd.exe ).
Run gcloud init :
C:\> gcloud init
Non-interactive (silent) deployment
You can automate Google Cloud CLI installation using the install script.
For Linux and MacOS:
Save the install script locally instead of piping it to bash.
Enter the following at a command prompt:
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com > install.sh
Run the script, passing arguments described as follows:
bash install.sh --disable-prompts
The install.sh options are:
--disable-prompts - disable prompts.
--install-dir= DIRECTORY - set the installation root
directory to DIRECTORY . The Google Cloud CLI is installed in
DIRECTORY /google-cloud-sdk . The default is $HOME.
For Windows:
Important: These flags are for the Windows installer
and are case sensitive.
/S - install silently. No installer pages are displayed. Use flags to
change install settings.
/D - set the default installation directory. It must be the last parameter
used in the command line and must not contain any quotes, even if the path
contains spaces. Only absolute paths are supported, for example /D=C:\CloudSDK
/allusers - install for all users
/singleuser - install for current user (default)
/screenreader - turn on screen reader mode (default is to turn it off)
/reporting - enable usage reporting (default is to turn off usage reporting)
/noreporting - disable usage reporting (default is to turn off usage reporting)
/nostartmenu - don't create start menu shortcut (default is to create
shortcut)
/nodesktop - don't create desktop shortcut (default is to create shortcut)
