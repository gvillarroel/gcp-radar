public interface BlobAppendableUpload extends BlobWriteSession
Interface representing those methods which can be used to write to and interact with an
appendable upload.
See Also: Storage#blobAppendableUpload(BlobInfo, BlobAppendableUploadConfig, BlobWriteOption...)
Implements
BlobWriteSession
Methods
getResult()
public abstract ApiFuture<BlobInfo> getResult ()
Return an ApiFuture <BlobInfo> which will represent the state of the object in
Google Cloud Storage.
This future will not resolve until:
The object is successfully finalized in Google Cloud Storage by calling AppendableUploadWriteableByteChannel#finalizeAndClose()
This session is detached from the upload without finalizing by calling AppendableUploadWriteableByteChannel#closeWithoutFinalizing()
The session is closed by calling AppendableUploadWriteableByteChannel#close()
A terminal failure occurs, the terminal failure will become the exception result
NOTICE: Some fields may not be populated unless finalization has completed.
If a terminal failure is encountered, calling either ApiFuture#get() or ApiFuture#get(long, TimeUnit) will result in an java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException with the cause.
Returns
Type
Description
ApiFuture < BlobInfo >
open()
public abstract BlobAppendableUpload . AppendableUploadWriteableByteChannel open ()
Open the AppendableUploadWriteableByteChannel for
this session.
A session may only be open ed once. If multiple calls to open are made, an illegal
state exception will be thrown
The returned AppendableUploadWriteableByteChannel can throw IOExceptions from any of
its usual methods. Any IOException thrown can have a cause of a StorageException . However, not all IOExceptions will have StorageException s.
Returns
Type
Description
BlobAppendableUpload.AppendableUploadWriteableByteChannel
Exceptions
