Signatures

Signatures are one method for authenticating requests being sent to the
Cloud Storage XML API . Signatures are used, for example, when working
with signed URLs or HTML forms. This page applies to signatures created using
the V4 signing process, which is the recommended process for creating
signatures.
Signatures are specific to the Cloud Storage XML API and are distinct from
OAuth 2.0 tokens; OAuth 2.0 tokens can also be used with the XML API and
are more generally applicable across Google Cloud services, including the
Cloud Storage JSON API .
Overview
Signatures provides both identity and strong authentication, which ensures
that requests to Cloud Storage are processed using the authority of a
specific account. Signatures achieve such authentication without revealing the
sensitive key information, called secrets or private keys , associated with
that account.
When you make a request with a signature, Cloud Storage uses its copy
of the key information to calculate an equivalent signature for the request. If
the signature included in the request matches the signature calculated by
Cloud Storage, then Cloud Storage knows that the signature
was created using the relevant secret or private key.
In Cloud Storage, signatures must be used when working with:
Signed URLS .
HTML forms .
Additionally, signatures can be used in the Authorization header of XML
API requests.
Using signatures in direct requests is useful when performing
simple migrations from Amazon S3 ; however, the recommended
authentication flow for direct requests is to use OAuth 2.0 tokens.
Structure
The components and process for creating a signature depend on what you will
use it for and the authentication key you're working with; broadly, there are
two components to a signature: the signing key and request information . You
apply a signing algorithm to these two components to create the
signature. The table below summarizes the different use cases for signatures
and the components you need in each case to construct the signature:
Use case
Signing Key
Request information
HTML form with an RSA key
Directly use RSA private key
Base64-encoded policy document
HTML form with an HMAC key
Derive from HMAC key's secret
Base64-encoded policy document
Signed URL or signed header with an RSA key
Directly use RSA private key
String-to-sign
Signed URL or signed header with an HMAC key
Derive from HMAC key's secret
String-to-sign
String-to-sign
A string-to-sign includes meta information about your request and a hash of
the canonical request that you want to sign.
Structure
A string-to-sign must be UTF-8 encoded and has the following structure,
including the use of newlines between each element:
SIGNING_ALGORITHM
ACTIVE_DATETIME
CREDENTIAL_SCOPE
HASHED_CANONICAL_REQUEST
Signing algorithm
The value you use for SIGNING_ALGORITHM depends on the type of key
you use and the extensions you use for your headers or query parameters:
Use case
Value for SIGNING_ALGORITHM
x-goog-* extensions and an RSA key
GOOG4-RSA-SHA256
x-goog-* extensions and an HMAC key
GOOG4-HMAC-SHA256
x-amz-* extensions and an HMAC key
AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
Active datetime
The date and time the signature can be used, in the ISO 8601
basic format YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z' .
For signed URLs, the signature is usable from 15 minutes prior to the active
datetime until the expiration time you specify. The active datetime must match
the signed URL's X-Goog-Date query string parameter and must use the same
day that you specify in the credential scope .
For requests with signed headers, the signature is usable from 15 minutes
prior to the active datetime until 15 minutes after the active datetime. The
active datetime must match the x-goog-date header of the request using the
signature, and the active datetime must use the same day that you specify in
the credential scope .
Credential Scope
The credential scope for the request.
Hash of the canonical request
The hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of a canonical request . Use a SHA-256 hashing
function to create a hash value of the canonical request. Your programming
language should have a library for creating SHA-256 hashes. An example hash
value looks like:
436b7ce722d03b17d3f790255dd57904f7ed61c02ac5127a0ca8063877e4e42c
Example
The following is an example of a properly formed string-to-sign, with
newlines shown as actual new lines and not \n :

Policy document
A policy document defines what users with access to the corresponding
HTML form can upload to Cloud Storage. A policy document provides
authorization to ensure that the HTML form can upload files into the target
bucket. You can use policy documents to allow visitors to a website to upload
files to Cloud Storage.
A policy document is constructed in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The
policy document must be both UTF-8 and Base64-encoded. A policy document
contains the following sections:
Entry
Description
expiration
The expiration time of the policy document, in the ISO 8601 basic format YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z' . An expired policy document causes the HTML form to break.
conditions
An array of conditions that every upload must satisfy.
The conditions section must include:
A condition statement for each field that you use in your HTML form,
except for the x-goog-signature , file , and policy fields.
A "bucket" condition statement, even if you don't use the bucket field in
your HTML form.
If you want to use multiple condition statements for the same field, you should
make a separate HTML form for each. Three types of conditions can be used in
your condition statements:
Exact Matching
Performs exact matching for a field. The value used in the specified field
of the HTML form must match the value set in this condition. Set
this condition using either of the following syntax styles:
{" field " : " value "}
["eq", "$ field ", " value "]
All valid HTML form fields except Content-Length can use exact matching.
Starts With
If a field's value must start with a certain prefix, use the starts-with
condition with the following syntax:
["starts-with", "$ field ", " value "]
If a field's value has no restrictions, use the starts-with condition
with the following syntax:
["starts-with", "$ field ", ""]
All valid HTML form fields except Content-Length can use the starts-with
condition.
Content Length Range
Specifies a range of acceptable values that can be used in the
Content-Length field. Specify this condition using the following syntax:
["content-length-range", min_range , max_range ]
Example
The following is an example of a policy document:
{"expiration": "2020-06-16T11:11:11Z",
"conditions": [
["starts-with", "$key", ""],
{"bucket": "travel-maps"},
{"success_action_redirect": "http://www.example.com/success_notification.html"},
["eq", "$Content-Type", "image/jpeg"],
["content-length-range", 0, 1000000],
{"x-goog-algorithm": "GOOG4-RSA-SHA256"},
{"x-goog-credential": "example_account@example_project.iam.gserviceaccount.com/20191102/us-central1/storage/goog4_request"},
{"x-goog-date": "20191102T043530Z"}
]
}
This policy document defines the following conditions:
The form expires on June 16, 2020 at 11:11:11 UTC.
The file name can start with any valid character.
The file must be uploaded to the bucket travel-maps .
If the upload is successful, the user is redirected to
http://www.example.com/success_notification.html .
The form allows only images to be uploaded.
A user cannot upload a file larger than 1 MB.
Credential scope
The credential scope is a string that appears in both string-to-signs and
policy documents. The credential scope has the following structure:
DATE / LOCATION / SERVICE / REQUEST_TYPE
The credential scope has the following components:
DATE : The date the signature becomes usable, formatted as YYYYMMDD.
LOCATION : For Cloud Storage resources, you can use any
value for LOCATION . The recommended value to use is the
location associated with the resource that the signature applies to.
For example, us-central1 . This parameter exists to maintain compatibility
with Amazon S3.
SERVICE : The service name. In most cases when accessing
Cloud Storage resources, this value is storage . When using
Amazon S3 x-amz extensions, this value is s3 .
REQUEST_TYPE : The request type. In most cases when accessing
Cloud Storage resources, this value is goog4_request . When using
Amazon S3 x-amz extensions, this value is aws4_request .
For example, a typical credential scope looks like:
20191102/us-central1/storage/goog4_request
While a credential scope when using a string-to-sign with x-amz extensions
looks like:
20150830/us-east1/s3/aws4_request
Signing
To create a signature, you use a signing algorithm , also known as a
cryptographic hash function, to sign your string-to-sign or policy document. The
signing algorithm produces a message digest , which must be hex-encoded to
create the final signature. The signing algorithm that you use depends on the
type of authentication key you have:
Authentication key
Signing algorithm
Signing key
RSA key
RSA-SHA256
Directly use RSA private key
HMAC key
HMAC-SHA256
Derive from HMAC key's secret
The RSA-SHA256 signing algorithm can be
run using the IAM signBlob method . Tools such as the
gcloud CLI and most Google Cloud client libraries
let you create signed URLs using the signBlob method.
You can also create RSA key signatures locally using a programming language that
has a library for performing RSA signatures, such as the
pyopenssl library ; however, this method is discouraged , because it
requires you to create and download the private key of a service account.
Derive the signing key from the HMAC key
When signing with an HMAC key, you must create a UTF-8 encoded signing key that
is derived from your HMAC key secret. The derived key is specific to the date,
location, service, and request type associated with your request. The
following pseudocode shows how to derive the signing key:
key_date = HMAC-SHA256(" PREFIX " + HMAC_KEY_SECRET , " DATE ")
key_region = HMAC-SHA256(key_date, " LOCATION ")
key_service = HMAC-SHA256(key_region, " SERVICE ")
signing_key = HMAC-SHA256(key_service, " REQUEST_TYPE ")
The pseudocode has the following components:
PREFIX : In most cases when accessing Cloud Storage
resources, this value is GOOG4 . When using Amazon S3 x-amz extensions,
this value is AWS4 .
HMAC_KEY_SECRET : The secret for the HMAC key that you are using
to make and sign the request.
DATE , LOCATION , SERVICE ,
REQUEST_TYPE : These values must match the values specified in the
credential scope .
Once you've derived the signing key, you create the signature locally using a
programming language that includes a library with the HMAC-SHA256 signing
algorithm.
After signing
To complete the signature, the output of the signing, called the message
digest must be hex-encoded.
Example
The following is pseudocode for signing a policy document:
EncodedPolicy = Base64Encode(PolicyDocument)
MessageDigest = SigningAlgorithm(SigningKey, EncodedPolicy)
Signature = HexEncode(MessageDigest)
The following is pseudocode for signing a string-to-sign:
MessageDigest = SigningAlgorithm(SigningKey, StringToSign)
Signature = HexEncode(MessageDigest)
What's next
Use your signature in a signed URL .
Use your signature in a request with an Authorization header .
Use your signature in an HTML form .
