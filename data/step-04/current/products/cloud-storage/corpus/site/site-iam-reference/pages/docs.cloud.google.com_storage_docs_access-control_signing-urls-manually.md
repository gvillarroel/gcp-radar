V4 signing process with your own program
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes an algorithm for implementing the V4 signing process so that
you can create Cloud Storage RSA key signed URLs in your own
workflow, using a programming language of your choice.
Note: In most cases, it's faster and easier to create signed URLs
by using the V4 signing process with Cloud Storage tools .
Before you begin
Before creating a program that implements the V4 signing process, you must
complete the following steps:
Create a service account . If you already have a service account,
you can skip this step. For more information about service accounts, see
Service accounts overview .
Give the service account sufficient permission such that it could
perform the request that the signed URL will make.
For example, if your signed URL will allow a user to read object data, the
service account must itself have permission to read the object data.
If the signing algorithm you intend to use is not built into
Google Cloud, generate a new private key , or have an existing
private key for the service account. The key can be in either JSON or
PKCS12 format.
Algorithm for signing URLs
Your program should include the following steps:
Construct the canonical request as a string. The canonical request defines
elements that users must include in their request when they use your
signed URL.
See Canonical Requests for details about the parts and format required.
Construct the string-to-sign . The string-to-sign is the basis for creating
a signature and includes within it the hex-encoded hash value of the
canonical request.
See Signatures for details about the format of the string-to-sign.
Sign the string-to-sign using an RSA signature with SHA-256. The result
of this signing is your request signature . There are several options for
signing:
You can use the IAM signBlob method provided by
Google Cloud.
You can use a programming language that has a library for performing RSA
signatures.
Note: You can also sign the string-to-sign using HMAC if you are using
the XML API for interoperable access.
Construct the signed URL by using the following concatenation:
HOSTNAME + PATH_TO_RESOURCE + "?" + CANONICAL_QUERY_STRING + "&X-Goog-Signature=" + REQUEST_SIGNATURE
The signed URL has the following components:
HOSTNAME : This should be https://storage.googleapis.com .
PATH_TO_RESOURCE : This should match the value you used in
constructing the canonical request.
CANONICAL_QUERY_STRING : This should match the values you used
in constructing the canonical request.
REQUEST_SIGNATURE : This is the output from using an RSA
signature in the previous step, hex-encoded.
Here is a sample completed URL:

Python sample program
You can use the Cloud Storage client libraries to create signed URLs
for many common programming languages. See V4 signing process with
Cloud Storage tools for examples.
The following sample shows an implementation of the algorithm for signing URLs
that does not use the Cloud Storage client libraries. The sample uses
the Python programming language but can be adapted to the language of your
choice.
