This page explains the concepts of availability and durability within
Cloud Storage:
Availability: The ability to access data immediately upon request.
Durability: Long-term protection to ensure data remains intact and
uncorrupted.
The following sections cover how Cloud Storage redundantly stores
data, the default replication behavior for dual-regions and multi-regions,
and advanced features like turbo replication and cross-bucket
replication.
Key concepts
The monthly availability of data stored in Cloud Storage depends on
the storage class of the data and the location type of the bucket. For more
information, see available storage classes .
Cloud Storage is designed for at least 99.999999999% (11 9's) annual
durability, regardless of storage class and location type.
To achieve this, Cloud Storage uses erasure coding and stores
data pieces redundantly across multiple devices.
Writes to Cloud Storage are only confirmed as successful after
data has been redundantly stored.
Checksums are stored and regularly revalidated to proactively verify the
integrity of all data at rest, as well as to detect corruption of data in
transit. If required, corrections are automatically made using redundant
data.
How a bucket's location type affects availability and durability
Regional buckets store data redundantly in at least two availability
zones in the region you select. They are designed to tolerate the loss of
any one availability zone in the region.
Object writes to a bucket are only confirmed as successful after data
has been redundantly stored across at least two different availability
zones.
In the unlikely event of an availability zone outage, such as one caused
by a natural disaster, regional buckets remain available, with no need to
change storage paths.
Dual-region and multi-region buckets store data redundantly in at
least two separate geographic places.
For dual-regions, you select the specific regions in which your objects
are stored.
For multi-regions, the specific data centers used for storing your data
are determined by Cloud Storage as needed, but are located within
the geographic boundary of the multi-region and are separated by at least
100 miles. This provides redundancy across regions at a lower storage cost
than dual-regions.
Object writes to a bucket are only confirmed as successful after data has
been redundantly stored in one initial region, across at least two
different availability zones (same as writes to a regional bucket). Data
is then asynchronously replicated using default replication to
provide the expected redundancy across regions.
If one of the regions in which an object is stored becomes unavailable
after the object is successfully uploaded but prior to it being
replicated for georedundancy, Cloud Storage's
strong consistency ensures that stale versions of the object
won't be served and that subsequent overwrites aren't reverted when
the region becomes available again.
As a premium offering, you can optionally enable
turbo replication on dual-region buckets to achieve faster, more
predictable replication times across regions for newly written data.
In the unlikely event of a region-wide outage, such as one caused by a
natural disaster, dual-region and multi-region buckets remain available,
with no need to change storage paths.
To achieve redundancy between a region pairing not available as a
dual-region, consider creating a separate bucket for each region and using
Storage Transfer Service event-driven transfers or
cross-bucket replication to keep the buckets in
sync.
Locally redundant data, such as data in a zonal bucket, provides 99.999999999%
(11 9's) annual durability against hardware failures like host, rack, or
drive failures. However, because data is not redundant across availability
zones, it may become unavailable or permanently lost in the event of an
availability zone failure. As a result, locally redundant storage is most
suitable for data that can be replaced or reconstructed.
Redundancy across regions
While traditional storage models often rely on an active-passive approach with
"primary" and "secondary" geographic locations, Cloud Storage
dual-regions and multi-regions provide an active-active architecture based on a
single bucket with redundancy across regions. This simplifies the
disaster recovery process by eliminating the need for users to replicate
data from one bucket to another or manually failover to a secondary bucket in
the case of primary region downtime.
Cloud Storage always understands the current state of a bucket and
transparently serves objects from an available region as required. As a result,
dual-region and multi-region buckets are designed to have a
recovery time objective (RTO) of zero, and temporary regional failures are
normally invisible to users; in the case of a regional outage, dual-region and
multi-region buckets automatically continue serving all data that has been
replicated across regions.
However, redundancy across regions occurs asynchronously, and any data that does
not finish replicating across regions prior to a region becoming unavailable is
inaccessible until the downed region comes back online. Data could potentially
be lost in the very unlikely case of physical destruction of the region.
Default replication in Cloud Storage is designed to provide
redundancy across regions for 99.9% of newly written objects within a target of
one hour and 100% of newly written objects within a target of 12 hours. Newly
written objects include uploads, rewrites, copies, and compositions.
Cloud Storage also offers a cross-bucket replication capability
that can be used to replicate data between independent buckets to meet
additional data replication needs that aren't met by dual-region or multi-region
locations.
Turbo replication
Turbo replication provides faster redundancy across regions for data in your
dual-region buckets, which reduces the risk of data loss exposure and
helps support uninterrupted service following a regional outage. When
enabled, turbo replication is designed to replicate 100% of newly written
objects to the two regions that constitute a dual-region within the
recovery point objective of 15 minutes , regardless of object size.
Note that even for default replication, most objects finish replication
within minutes.
While redundancy across regions and turbo replication help support
business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) efforts, administrators
should plan and implement a full BCDR architecture that's appropriate for their
workload.
For more information, see the
Step-by-step guide to designing disaster recovery for applications in Google Cloud .
Limitations
Turbo replication is only available for buckets in dual-regions .
Turbo replication cannot be managed through the XML API, including creating a
new bucket with turbo replication enabled.
When turbo replication is enabled on a bucket, it can take up to 10 seconds
before it begins to apply to newly written objects.
Object writes that began prior to enabling turbo replication on a bucket
replicate across regions at the default replication rate.
Object composition that uses any source objects written using
default replication in the last 12 hours creates a composite object that
also uses default replication.
Cross-bucket replication
In some cases, you might want to maintain a copy of your data in a second
bucket. Cross-bucket replication copies new and updated
objects asynchronously from a source bucket to a destination bucket.
Cross-bucket replication differs from default replication and turbo replication
in that your data exists in two independent buckets, each with their own
configurations such as storage location, encryption, access, and storage class.
It is especially suitable for:
Data sovereignty : Maintain data across geographically distant regions.
Maintaining separate development and production versions : Create distinct
buckets and namespaces, so that development doesn't affect your production
workload.
Sharing data : Replicate data to a bucket owned by a vendor or partner.
Aggregating data : Combine data from different buckets into a single
bucket to run analytics workloads.
Managing cost, security, and compliance : Maintain your data under
different ownerships, storage classes, and retention periods.
Cross-bucket replication uses Storage Transfer Service to replicate objects and
Pub/Sub to get alerted of changes to the source and destination
buckets. You can enable cross-bucket replication on new buckets you create and
on existing buckets.
For buckets where the object change rate is under 3,000 per second and objects
are under one GiB, cross-bucket replication commonly takes minutes to tens
of minutes, but no specific upper bound is supported. Also, buckets experiencing
higher change rates or having larger objects can expect to see higher
replication delays.
For instructions on using cross-bucket replication, see
Use cross-bucket replication .
Note: When using cross-bucket replication, you might incur charges from data
transfer, data storage, data processing, data retrieval, and operations from
Cloud Storage, Storage Transfer Service, and Pub/Sub. For details on
pricing, see Cloud Storage pricing ,
Storage Transfer Service pricing , and Pub/Sub pricing .
Limitations
Custom names are not supported for cross-bucket replication jobs. Create requests that
contain a value for the name field return an error.
Cross-bucket replication is not supported for hierarchical namespace buckets.
Object deletions in the source bucket are not replicated to the destination
bucket.
Object lifecycle configurations aren't replicated.
When objects are replicated, timestamp metadata (for example,
timeCreated and timeUpdated ) is not preserved. See
Transfers between Cloud Storage buckets
for details on metadata preservation.
Because cross-bucket replication can be used to replicate data between buckets
located in any Google Cloud location, cross-bucket replication performance
varies based on the locations selected. Consequently, cross-bucket replication
does not offer a Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
Objects that are already in the bucket when a replication job is created are
not automatically replicated. Only new and updated objects are replicated.
To replicate existing objects, create a one-time Storage Transfer Service transfer
job from your existing bucket to the new bucket. See
Create transfers for instructions.
Performance monitoring
Cloud Storage monitors the oldest unreplicated objects in dual-region
and multi-region buckets using default replication or turbo replication. If an
object remains unreplicated for longer than its RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
time, it's considered to be out of RPO. Each minute in which one or more objects
are out of RPO is counted as a "bad" minute.
For example, if one object yielded 20 bad minutes from 9:00-9:20 AM, and another
object yielded 10 bad minutes from 9:15-9:25 AM, then there are two objects for
the month that are out of RPO. The total number of bad minutes for the month
is 25 minutes, because from 9:00 AM to 9:25 AM there was at least one object
that was missing its RPO.
For buckets using turbo replication, the RPO for objects is 15 minutes.
For buckets using default replication, the RPO for objects is 12 hours.
For buckets that use default replication, objects are typically replicated
in one hour or less.
Cross-bucket replication doesn't provide an RPO.
Within the Google Cloud console, the Percent of minutes out of RPO
graph lets you monitor the percentage of bad minutes during the past 30
days for your bucket when using default replication or turbo replication within
dual-region or multi-region buckets. This service level indicator can be used to
monitor your bucket's Monthly Replication Time Conformance. Similarly, the
Percent of objects out of target tracks object replications that did not
occur within the RPO. This service level indicator can be used to monitor the
bucket's Monthly Replication Volume Conformance. For more information, see
Cloud Storage monitoring and Cloud Storage SLA .
