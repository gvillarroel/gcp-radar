launch stage descriptions .
This page describes how to use AI-powered assistance through
Gemini to help you better understand your data storage landscape
in Cloud Storage. When you use Gemini Cloud Assist, you can enter
prompts about how Cloud Storage works in general, and when you enable a
Storage Intelligence subscription, you can enter prompts about specific
buckets and objects.
You can then use the information provided by Gemini Cloud Assist to
do the following:
Analyze data usage patterns and trends
Identify opportunities to save on storage costs
Optimize your data for security and compliance
Make informed decisions on managing your data
Gemini doesn't use your prompts or its
responses as data to train its models without your express permission. For more
information about how Google uses your data, see
How Gemini for Google Cloud uses your data .
This page is intended for developers, data analysts or data engineers, platform
admins, finance operators, and compliance officers. It assumes that you know
how to use Cloud Storage and query linked datasets .
What prompts can Gemini answer?
To understand your data storage, you can provide Gemini Cloud Assist
with a prompt , which is a natural language statement or question.
When you use Gemini Cloud Assist alone without a
Storage Intelligence subscription, you can ask prompts about how
Cloud Storage generally works, such as the following:
"How do I transition objects from one storage class to another?"
"How do I enable soft delete on a bucket?"
When you enable a Storage Intelligence subscription ,
you can also ask prompts related to cost saving opportunities, security and
compliance, and data discovery. Gemini Cloud Assist can use the
metadata contained in Storage Insights datasets to generate insights ,
which are responses to prompts about your bucket and object metadata and usage.
You can ask prompts such as the following:
Prompts related to usage and cost savings:
"5 largest buckets without Object Lifecycle Management"
"5 largest buckets without Autoclass enabled"
Prompts related to security and compliance:
"5 largest buckets without object versioning enabled"
"5 largest objects with a retention expiration date within the next 30 days"
Prompts related to data discovery:
"Buckets with a high volume of small files (each under 1 MB)"
"Objects in Standard storage class smaller than 50 MB"
Before you begin
In order to use Gemini Cloud Assist for general prompts related to
Cloud Storage, you must first set up Gemini Cloud Assist, including
getting required roles.
Set up Gemini Cloud Assist
Ensure that
Gemini Cloud Assist is set up for your Google Cloud project .
If you want to enter prompts related to specific buckets and objects, you must
also complete the following prerequisite steps:
Enable Storage Intelligence, which gives you access to using
Storage Insights datasets.
Create a Storage Insights dataset, which Gemini Cloud Assist will
analyze to provide information about specific buckets and objects.
Alternatively, if there's an existing dataset you want to use, you can
get the required IAM roles for accessing the existing dataset.
Ensure that the Storage Insights service agent has access to the dataset
Gemini Cloud Assist will analyze. This enables the dataset to be
read and analyzed.
Enable Storage Intelligence
Ensure that
Storage Intelligence is enabled
on the project, folder, or organization that contains or will contain the
datasets that Gemini Cloud Assist will use to answer prompts.
Create a dataset
Note: If you plan to use an existing dataset, you can skip this step.
Create a dataset
and link the dataset to BigQuery .
Grant required roles for accessing datasets
Note: If you plan to use an existing dataset, you can skip this step.
When a user first creates a dataset configuration, an Storage Insights
service agent is created. The service agent follows the naming format
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-storageinsights.iam.gserviceaccount.com
and appears on the
IAM page of the Google Cloud console
when you select the Include Google-provided role grants checkbox.
In order to use Gemini Cloud Assist for prompts related to bucket or
object metadata, you need to enable the Storage Insights service agent to read
datasets. Ask your administrator to grant the service agent the
BigQuery Data Viewer role ( roles/bigquery.dataViewer ) on
the organization, folder, or project that contains the dataset you want to
analyze.
For instructions on granting roles to service agents, see
create and grant roles to service agents .
Get required roles for accessing datasets
Note: If you created a dataset from scratch, you most likely already
have the required permissions and can skip this step.
To get the permissions that
you need to get insights on bucket and object metadata,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the project, folder, or organization that contains the datasets you want to analyze:
BigQuery Job User ( roles/bigquery.jobUser )
BigQuery Data Viewer ( roles/bigquery.dataViewer )
Storage Insights Viewer ( roles/storageinsights.viewer )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Analyze your data storage by using natural language prompts
As an early-stage technology, Gemini for Google Cloud
products can generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. We recommend that you
validate all output from Gemini for Google Cloud products before you use it.
For more information, see
Gemini for Google Cloud and responsible AI .
Note: To improve the quality of responses, include Cloud Storage in
the prompt. For example:
5 largest Cloud Storage buckets without object versioning enabled .
To enter prompts to Gemini Cloud Assist, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage Storage Insights page.
Go to Storage Insights
In the toolbar, click spark ( Gemini )
to open the Cloud Assist chat panel.
The Cloud Assist chat panel appears.
In the Cloud Assist chat panel, enter a natural language prompt
about your data storage. For example, you might enter the following:
Which is my largest bucket
Click play_arrow ( Generate ).
If prompted to, enter the name of the dataset that Gemini
will analyze to generate the response, then click
play_arrow ( Generate ).
If successful, Gemini Cloud Assist generates a response similar to
the following:
Here's what I found by analyzing the data in EXAMPLE_DATASET :
Bucket name
Size
my-bucket
39.1 TB
The underlying SQL query that Gemini Cloud Assist uses is also
returned. The generated SQL query is similar to the following:
SELECT bucket_id, bucket_size
FROM buckets
WHERE project_id = 'example-project'
ORDER BY bucket_size DESC
LIMIT 1;
Optionally, you can enter suggested prompts:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage Storage Insights page.
Go to Storage Insights
In the auto_awesome Suggested prompts
section, select a suggested prompt. For example, a suggested prompt might
say: Storage size broken down by object content type .
If successful, Gemini Cloud Assist generates a response similar to
the following:
Here's what I found by analyzing the data in EXAMPLE_DATASET :
Content type
Size
MP4
483.2 GB
MOV
239.1 GB
MP3
125.8 GB
The underlying SQL query that Gemini Cloud Assist uses is also
returned. The generated SQL query is similar to the following:
SELECT
oa.contentType, ROUND(sum(oa.size) / (1024 * 1024 * 1024), 2) AS total_size_gb
FROM object_attributes_latest AS oa
GROUP BY oa.contentType
ORDER BY sum(oa.size) DESC;
Data processing quotas
When you run a prompt using Gemini Cloud Assist to get information
about your data in Cloud Storage, Gemini Cloud Assist processes your
datasets to provide answers to your prompts. If a prompt requires processing
less than 800 GB of data to answer, Gemini Cloud Assist returns the
underlying SQL query for the prompt and executes the query, returning the
response in SQL. If a prompt requires processing 800 GB of data or more to
answer, Gemini Cloud Assist only returns the underlying SQL query and
doesn't execute the query. You can
run the query by yourself using BigQuery .
Gemini Cloud Assist can process up to 50 TiB of data per month, per
organization. If your organization surpasses this limit,
Gemini Cloud Assist will return the underlying SQL queries for any
additional prompts you run but won't execute the queries. Running additional
prompts results in a Monthly Quota Exceeded response message.
Limitations
When using prompts to analyze Cloud Storage resources, you can
specify up to five resources in the prompt. For example:
5 largest buckets without Autoclass enabled . Even if you include more than
five resources in the prompt, Gemini Cloud Assist can only return
results for the top five resources that match the prompt's criteria.
Gemini Cloud Assist uses the bucket and object metadata contained in
Storage Insights datasets to respond to prompts about your data storage.
The following data is not available in Storage Insights datasets, meaning
that Gemini Cloud Assist lacks the proper context to respond to
prompts relating to that data:
Specific cost data, for example: "how much does my bucket cost per month".
Activity data, for example: "what is the last access time of my object".
Data about the configuration of certain features, such as
soft delete. For example: "which buckets don't have
soft delete enabled".
Gemini Cloud Assist also lacks the proper context to respond to
prompts related to time series information. For example: "how much did my
bucket grow in the last 3 weeks". This is because Gemini Cloud Assist
only reads a dataset's latest snapshot.
