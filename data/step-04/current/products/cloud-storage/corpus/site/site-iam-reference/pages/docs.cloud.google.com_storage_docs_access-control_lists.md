Access control lists (ACLs)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Usage
This page provides an overview of access control lists (ACLs), which let you
control access to individual buckets or objects. To learn about other ways of
controlling access to buckets and objects, read
Overview of Access Control .
Should you use access control lists?
In most cases, you should avoid using ACLs, and you should
enable uniform bucket-level access for your buckets, which prevents ACL usage:
ACLs can't be used exclusively to control access to your Google Cloud
resources, because ACLs can't be set on the overall project or resources
outside Cloud Storage.
Enabling uniform bucket-level access creates a simpler access control surface and
lets you use additional Google Cloud features. For more information, see
should you use uniform bucket-level access .
The domain restricted sharing organization policy and
custom organization policies don't prevent access granted by ACLs,
potentially leading to unintended access.
Unexpected behaviors and access can occur when using ACLs in projects that
have IAM conditions set at or above the project level.
You most likely want to use ACLs in the following cases:
You need to customize access to individual objects within a bucket, such as if
you want the uploader of an object to have full control over that object, but
less access to other objects in your bucket.
You are exclusively using the XML API or require interoperability
with Amazon S3.
What is an access control list?
An access control list (ACL) is a mechanism you can use to define who has access
to your buckets and objects, as well as what level of access they have. In
Cloud Storage, you apply ACLs to individual buckets and objects. Each
ACL consists of one or more entries . An entry gives a specific user (or group)
the ability to perform specific actions. Each entry consists of two pieces of
information:
A permission , which defines what actions can be performed (for example,
read or write).
A scope (sometimes referred to as a grantee ), which defines who can
perform the specified actions (for example, a specific user or group of
users).
As an example, suppose you have a bucket that you want anyone to be able to
access objects from, but you also want your collaborator to be able to add or
remove objects from the bucket. In this case, your ACL would consist of two
entries:
In one entry, you would give READER permission to a scope of allUsers .
In the other entry, you would give WRITER permission to the scope of your
collaborator (there are several ways to specify this person, such as by their
email).
The maximum number of ACL entries you can create for a bucket or object is 100.
When the entry scope is a group or domain, it counts as one ACL entry regardless
of how many users are in the group or domain.
When a user requests access to a bucket or object, the Cloud Storage
system reads the bucket or object ACL and determines whether to allow or reject
the access request. If the ACL grants the user permission for the requested
operation, the request is allowed. If the ACL does not grant the user permission
for the requested operation, the request fails and a 403 Forbidden error is
returned.
Note that while ACLs can be used to manage most actions involving buckets and
objects, the ability to create a bucket comes from having the appropriate
project permission .
Permissions
Permissions describe what can be done to a given object or bucket.
Cloud Storage lets you assign the following concentric
permissions for your buckets and objects, as shown in the following table:
Buckets
Objects
READER
Allows a user to list a bucket's contents. Also allows a user to
read bucket metadata, excluding ACLs.
Allows a user to download an object's data.
WRITER
Gives a user all access that's granted by the READER
permission. Additionally allows a user to create, replace, and delete
objects in a bucket, including creating objects using multipart
uploads.
N/A. You cannot apply this permission to objects.
OWNER
Gives a user all access that's granted by the WRITER
permission. Also allows a user to read and write bucket metadata,
including ACLs, and to work with tags on the bucket.
Gives a user all access that's granted by the READER
permission. Also allows a user to read and write object metadata,
including ACLs.
Default
Buckets have the predefined
project-private ACL applied
when they are created. Buckets are always owned by the
project-owners group.
Objects have the predefined
project-private ACL applied
when they are uploaded. Objects are always owned by the original
requester who uploaded the object.
Note: You cannot grant discrete permissions for reading or writing ACLs or other
metadata. To allow someone to read and write ACLs, you must grant them OWNER
permission.
In this page, we generally refer to the permissions as READER , WRITER ,
and OWNER , which are how they are specified in the JSON API and the
Google Cloud console . If you are using the XML API , the equivalent
permissions are READ , WRITE , and FULL_CONTROL , respectively.
Scopes
Scopes specify who it is that has a given permission.
An ACL consists of one or more entries, where each entry grants permissions to
a scope. You can specify an ACL scope using any of the following entities:
Scope ("grantee")
Entity Type(s)
Example
Special identifier for all entities
User
allUsers
Special identifier for all valid accounts
User
allAuthenticatedUsers
User account email address
User
jeffersonloveshiking@gmail.com
Service account email address
User
my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Google group email address
Group
work-group@googlegroups.com
Convenience values for projects
Project
owners-123456789012
Google Workspace domain
Domain
dana@example.com
Cloud Identity domain
Domain
dana@example.com
Special identifier for all entities :
The special scope identifier allUsers represents any entity on the
Internet. Note that while this identifier is a User entity type, when
using the Google Cloud console it's labeled as a Public entity type.
Special identifier for all valid accounts :
The special scope identifier allAuthenticatedUsers represents most
authenticated accounts, including service accounts. For more information,
see IAM principals . Note that while this identifier is a
User entity type, when using the Google Cloud console it's labeled as
a Public entity type.
User account email address :
Every user who has a user account must have a unique email address
associated with that account. You can specify a scope by using any email
address that is associated with a user account.
Cloud Storage remembers email addresses as they are provided in
ACLs until the entries are removed or replaced. If a user changes email
addresses, you should update ACL entries to reflect these changes.
Service account email address :
Every service account has a unique email address associated with it.
You can specify a scope by using the email address that is associated with
the service account.
Google group email address :
Every Google group has a unique email address that is associated with
the group. For example, the Cloud Storage Announce group has
the following email address: gs-announce@googlegroups.com. You can find the
email address that is associated with a Google group by clicking About
on the homepage of every Google group.
Like user account email addresses, Cloud Storage remembers group
email addresses as they are provided in ACLs until the entries are removed.
You don't need to worry about updating Google Group email addresses,
because Google Group email addresses are permanent and unlikely to change.
Convenience values for projects :
Convenience values allow you to grant bulk access to your project's
viewers, editors, and owners. Convenience values combine a project role
and an associated project number. For example, in project 867489160491 ,
editors are identified as editors-867489160491 . You can find your project
number on the homepage of the Google Cloud console .
You should generally avoid using convenience values in production
environments, because they require granting basic roles ,
a practice which is discouraged in production environments.
Google Workspace or Cloud Identity :
Google Workspace and Cloud Identity customers can associate
their email accounts with an Internet domain name. When you do this, each
email account takes the form USERNAME @ YOUR_DOMAIN .com.
You can specify a scope by using any Internet domain name that is associated
with Google Workspace or Cloud Identity.
Concentric permissions and scopes
When specifying ACLs in Cloud Storage, you do not need to list multiple
scopes to grant multiple permissions. Cloud Storage uses concentric
permissions, so when you grant WRITER permission, you also grant READER
permission, and if you grant OWNER permission, you also grant READER and
WRITER permission.
When specifying an ACL, most tools allow you to
specify multiple scopes for the same entry. The most permissive permission is
the access granted to the scope. For example, if you provide two entries for a
user, one with READER permission and one with WRITER permission on a bucket,
the user will have WRITER permission on the bucket.
In the XML API, it is not possible to provide two ACL entries with the same
scope. For example, granting a user READ permission and WRITE permission on
a bucket results in an error. Instead, grant the user WRITE permission, which
also grants the user READ permission.
ACLs and IAM
Identity and Access Management (IAM) and ACLs work in tandem to grant access
to your buckets and objects, which means a user only needs the relevant
permission from either of these systems in order to access a bucket or object.
In general, permissions granted by IAM policies don't appear in
ACLs, and permissions granted by ACLs don't appear in IAM
policies. See IAM relation to ACLs for more information.
Behavior with IAM deny
An IAM deny policy overrides any applicable access that
would otherwise be granted by an ACL you've set, when the deny policy and the
ACL target the same permission.
For example, if a bucket has a deny policy that prevents a user from having
the storage.objects.get permission, and you create an ACL that grants the
user the READER role on an object within the bucket, the user won't
be able to view the object in the bucket. However, if the deny policy
specifies the storage.buckets.get permission and the ACL grants the
WRITER role on the bucket, the user won't be able to retrieve the bucket's
metadata, but can still list, create, and delete objects in the bucket.
Predefined ACLs
A predefined ACL, also sometimes known as a canned ACL, is an alias for a set
of specific ACL entries that you can use to quickly apply many ACL entries at
once to a bucket or object.
Caution: By applying a predefined ACL to an existing bucket or object, you
completely replace the existing bucket or object ACL with the predefined ACL.
This change might cause you to lose access to the bucket or object ACL in some
cases. For example, if you are in the project owners group but are not the
owner of an object with projectPrivate ACL, then after you apply the
predefined ACL publicRead to the object, you lose OWNER permission and
thus no longer can access the object ACL. If this occurs, you can use the
IAM role storage.objectAdmin so that you have the
permission necessary to update the object's ACL and correct the change.
The following table lists predefined ACLs and shows which ACL entries are applied
for each predefined ACL. When using the table, note that:
The project owners group has ownership of buckets in the project, and the user
that creates an object has ownership of that object. If an object was created
by an anonymous user, then the project owners group has ownership of the
object.
In the table, the JSON API descriptions of permissions, OWNER , WRITER ,
and READER , are used. The equivalent XML API scopes are FULL_CONTROL ,
WRITE , and READ .
JSON API/ gcloud storage
XML API
Description
private
private
Gives the bucket or object owner OWNER permission for a
bucket or object.
bucketOwnerRead
bucket-owner-read
Gives the object owner OWNER permission, and gives the
bucket owner READER permission. This is used
only with objects .
bucketOwnerFullControl
bucket-owner-full-control
Gives the object and bucket owners OWNER permission.
This is used only with objects .
projectPrivate
project-private
Gives permission to the project team based on their roles. Anyone who
is part of the team has READER permission. Project
owners and project editors have OWNER permission. This is
the default ACL for newly created buckets. This is also the default
ACL for newly created objects unless the default object ACL for that bucket has been
changed.
authenticatedRead
authenticated-read
Gives the bucket or object owner OWNER permission, and
gives all authenticated user account holders READER
permission.
publicRead
public-read
Gives the bucket or object owner OWNER permission, and
gives all users, both authenticated and anonymous, READER
permission. When you apply this to an object, anyone on the Internet
can read the object without authenticating. When you apply this to a
bucket, anyone on the Internet can list objects without
authenticating.
* See the note at the end of the table regarding caching.
publicReadWrite
public-read-write
Gives the bucket owner OWNER permission, and gives all
users, both authenticated and anonymous, READER and
WRITER permission. This ACL applies only to buckets. When
you apply this to a bucket, anyone on the Internet can list, create,
replace, and delete objects without authenticating.
Important : Setting a bucket to
publicReadWrite allows anyone on the Internet to
upload anything to your bucket. You are responsible for this
content.
* See the note at the end of the table regarding caching.
* By default, publicly readable objects are served with a Cache-Control
header that allows the objects to be cached for 3600 seconds. If you need to
ensure that updates become visible immediately, you should
set the Cache-Control metadata for the objects to
Cache-Control:private, max-age=0, no-transform .
Default ACLs
When buckets are created or objects are uploaded, if you do not explicitly
assign an ACL to them, they are given the default ACL. You can change the
default ACL given to an object; the process to do so is described in
Changing default object ACLs . Note that when you change the default
ACL, the ACLs of objects that already exist in the bucket or buckets that
already exist in the project remain unchanged.
Default bucket ACLs
All buckets are owned by the project owners group. Additionally, project owners
are granted OWNER permission for any buckets inside their project that use a
predefined ACL .
If you create a bucket with the default bucket ACL—that is, you do not
specify a predefined ACL when you create the
bucket—your bucket has the predefined projectPrivate ACL applied to it.
Default object ACLs
By default, anyone who has OWNER permission or WRITER permission on a bucket
can upload objects into that bucket. When you upload an object, you can provide
a predefined ACL or not specify an ACL at all. If you don't
specify an ACL, Cloud Storage applies the bucket's default object ACL
to the object. Every bucket has a default object ACL, and this ACL is applied to
all objects uploaded to that bucket without a predefined ACL or an ACL specified
in the request (JSON API only). The initial value for the default object ACL of
every bucket is projectPrivate .
Based on how objects are uploaded, object ACLs are applied accordingly:
Authenticated Uploads
If you make an authenticated request to upload an object and do not specify
any object ACLs when you upload it, then you are listed as the owner of the
object and the predefined projectPrivate ACL is applied to the object by
default. This means:
You (the person who uploaded the object) are listed as the object owner.
Object ownership cannot be changed by modifying ACLs. You can change
object ownership only by replacing an object.
You (the object owner) are granted OWNER permission on the object. If
you attempt to give less than OWNER permission to the owner,
Cloud Storage automatically escalates the permission to OWNER .
The project owners and project editors group have OWNER permission on
the object.
The project team members group has READER permission on the object.
Anonymous Uploads
If an unauthenticated (anonymous) user uploads an object, which is possible
if a bucket grants the allUsers group WRITER or OWNER permission,
then the default bucket ACLs are applied to the object as described previously.
Anonymous users cannot specify a predefined ACL during object upload.
Important: If you change the default object ACL for a bucket, the change may
take time to propagate, and new objects created in the bucket may still get the
old default object ACL for a short period of time (see Consistency ). In
order to make sure that new objects created in the bucket will get the updated
default object ACL, you should wait at least 30 seconds between changing the
default object ACL and creating new objects.
ACL behavior
Cloud Storage helps you adhere to best practices by enforcing
some ACL modification rules, which prevent you from setting ACLs that make data
inaccessible:
You cannot apply an ACL that specifies a different bucket
or object owner.
Bucket and object ownership cannot be changed by modifying ACLs. If you
apply a new ACL to a bucket or object, be sure that the bucket or object
owner remains unchanged in the new ACL.
The bucket or object owner always has OWNER permission of the
bucket or object.
The owner of a bucket is the project owners group, and the owner of an
object is either the user who uploaded the object, or the project owners
group if the object was uploaded by an anonymous user.
When you apply a new ACL to a bucket or object, Cloud Storage
respectively adds OWNER permission to the bucket or object owner if you
omit the grants. It does not grant the project owners group OWNER
permission for an object (unless the object was created by an anonymous
user), so you must explicitly include it.
You cannot apply ACLs that change the ownership of a bucket or object (which
should not be confused with the OWNER permission). Once created in
Cloud Storage, bucket and object ownership are permanent. You can,
however, effectively change the ownership of objects (but not buckets) by
replacing them. Replacement is basically a delete operation followed immediately
by an upload operation. During an upload operation, the person who is performing
the upload becomes the owner of the object. Keep in mind that to replace an
object, the person performing the replacement (and gaining ownership of
the object by doing so) must have WRITER or OWNER permission on the bucket
in which the object is being uploaded.
Note: You can disable all ownership properties of a bucket and the objects
within it by enabling uniform bucket-level access . Doing so also removes all use
of ACLs in the bucket, making IAM policies the only access
control system used by the bucket.
