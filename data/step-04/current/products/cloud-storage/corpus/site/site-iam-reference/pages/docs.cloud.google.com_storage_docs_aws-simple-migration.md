Simple migration from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to complete a simple migration from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to
Cloud Storage. In a simple migration, you use your existing tools and
libraries for generating authenticated REST requests to Amazon S3 to
send authenticated requests to Cloud Storage instead.
If you are new to Cloud Storage and won't be using the API directly,
consider using the Google Cloud console to set up and manage transfers . The
Google Cloud console provides a graphical interface to Cloud Storage that
lets you accomplish many of your storage tasks using just a browser,
including migration of your data from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage.
If you want Cloud Storage to store a backup of your Amazon S3 data,
consider using event-driven transfers , which use Amazon S3 Event
Notifications to automatically keep a Cloud Storage bucket in sync
with your Amazon S3 source.
Migrate from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage in a simple migration scenario
In order to make requests to Cloud Storage, you need to complete the
following steps:
Set a default Google Cloud project .
Get an HMAC (hash-based message authentication code) key .
In your existing tools or libraries, make the following changes:
Change the request endpoint to use the Cloud Storage
XML API request endpoint .
Replace the Amazon Web Services (AWS) access and secret key with the
corresponding Cloud Storage access ID and secret
(collectively called your Cloud Storage HMAC key).
Make sure your x-amz- headers use supported Cloud Storage
values. For example, x-amz-storage-class should use one of the
available Cloud Storage storage classes .
When you use the Cloud Storage XML API in a simple migration
scenario, specifying the AWS signature identifier in the
Authorization header lets Cloud Storage know to expect
x-amz-* headers and Amazon S3 ACL XML syntax in your request.
Cloud Storage processes x-amz-* headers that have an
x-goog-* equivalent, such as those listed in the headers table ,
and it processes the x-amz-decoded-content-length header .
After you make these changes, you can start using your existing tools and
libraries to send HMAC requests to Cloud Storage.
For example, the following samples demonstrate how to list
Cloud Storage buckets using the Amazon S3 SDK:
Go

Set a default project
To use Cloud Storage in a simple migration scenario, it's recommended
that you set a default project , which Cloud Storage uses to
perform certain operations , such as GET service or PUT bucket. If you
don't set a default project, you must specify a project header .
in certain requests.
Important: Because the simple migration scenario uses HMAC keys, make sure that
the project you migrate to isn't subject to the
restrictAuthTypes constraint for the account type you intend to use.
To set a default project:
Open the Cloud Storage Settings page in the
Google Cloud console.
Select the Interoperability tab.
Click Set PROJECT-ID as default project , located in the
section Default project for interoperable access .
If the project is already the default project, you see
PROJECT-ID is your default project for interoperable access .
This project is now your default project. You can change your default project at
any time by choosing a different project and following these steps.
Alternatively specify a project header
Instead of, or in addition to, setting a default project, you can use the
x-amz-project-id header in individual requests that require you to specify a
project.
A request that uses x-amz-project-id uses the project specified in the
header, even if there is an existing default project.
The x-amz-project-id header is useful when:
You're working with multiple projects.
Your requests are made by a service account associated with a different
project, because service accounts use their parent project as the default
project.
Note that Amazon S3 does not have projects , so depending on the tools
or client libraries you use, specifying a x-amz-project-id header may not be
an option. In this case, you should set a default project .
Use HMAC keys
To use the Cloud Storage XML API in a simple migration scenario, use
Cloud Storage hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) keys
for the credentials. Typically, you should create an HMAC key that is
associated with a service account; however, you can alternatively use one
associated with a user account.
Authenticate in a simple migration scenario
Use the Authorization header
For operations in a simple migration scenario that require authentication, you
include an Authorization request header just like you do for requests to
Amazon S3. The Authorization header syntax for an Amazon S3 request is:
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential= AWS-ACCESS-KEY / CREDENTIAL_SCOPE , SignedHeaders= SIGNED_HEADERS , Signature= SIGNATURE
In a simple migration scenario, you only change the header to use your
Cloud Storage HMAC access ID and make sure the Signature you attach
is calculated with your Cloud Storage HMAC secret key:
Authorization: ALGORITHM Credential= GOOG-ACCESS-ID / CREDENTIAL_SCOPE , SignedHeaders= SIGNED_HEADERS , Signature= SIGNATURE
The parts of the Authorization header are:
ALGORITHM : The signature algorithm and version that you are using.
Using AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 indicates that you are using an HMAC V4 signature
and you intend to send x-amz-* headers. You can also use
GOOG4-HMAC-SHA256 , which indicates that you are using an HMAC V4 signature
and you intend to send x-goog-* headers, or GOOG4-RSA-SHA256 , which
indicates that you are using an RSA V4 signature and you intend to send
x-goog-* headers.
GOOG-ACCESS-ID : The access ID identifies the entity that is
making and signing the request. In a simple migration, replace the Amazon
Web Service (AWS) access key ID you use to access Amazon S3 with your
Cloud Storage HMAC access ID. Your Cloud Storage HMAC
access ID starts with GOOG .
CREDENTIAL_SCOPE : The credential scope, as
defined in the signature . In a simple migration, you don't need to
change credential scope if you are using AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 for your
ALGORITHM value.
SIGNED_HEADERS : A semicolon-separated list of names of headers
that must be included to sign this request. All headers should be lowercase
and sorted by character code.
An example of an Amazon S3-style signed header string looks like:
content-type;host;x-amz-date
In a simple migration, you don't need to make any changes to the signed
header string.
SIGNATURE : The signature that allows the request to be
authenticated. In a simple migration, replace the AWS access key
information with the equivalent Cloud Storage HMAC key information.
Sample authentication request
The following examples upload an object named /europe/france/paris.jpg to a
bucket named my-travel-maps , apply the predefined ACL public-read , and
define a custom metadata header for reviewers. Here is the request to a bucket
in Amazon S3:
PUT europe/france/paris.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: my-travel-maps.s3.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 11 Mar 2019 23:46:19 GMT
Content-Length: 888814

Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential= AWS-ACCESS-KEY /20190311/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=content-length;content-type;host;x-amz-acl;x-amz-date;x-amz-meta-reviewer, Signature= SIGNATURE
Here is the request for a bucket in Cloud Storage:
PUT europe/france/paris.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: my-travel-maps.storage.googleapis.com
Date: Mon, 11 Mar 2019 23:46:19 GMT
Content-Length: 888814
Content-Type: image/jpg
x-amz-acl: public-read
x-amz-date:20190311T192918Z
x-amz-meta-reviewer: joe,jane
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential= GOOG-ACCESS-ID /20190311/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=content-length;content-type;host;x-amz-acl;x-amz-date;x-amz-meta-reviewer, Signature= SIGNATURE
Here is the corresponding canonical request that was created for this request:
PUT

This request did not provide a Content-MD5 header, so an empty string is shown
in the second line of the message.
Access control in a simple migration scenario
To support simple migrations, Cloud Storage accepts ACLs produced by
Amazon S3. In a simple migration scenario, you use AWS as your signature
identifier, which tells Cloud Storage to expect ACL syntax using
Amazon S3 ACL XML syntax. You should ensure that the Amazon S3 ACLs you
use map to the Cloud Storage ACL model. For example, if your tools and
libraries use Amazon S3's ACL syntax to grant bucket WRITE permission, then
they must also grant bucket READ permission because Cloud Storage
permissions are concentric . You do not need to specify both WRITE and
READ permission when you grant WRITE permission using the
Cloud Storage syntax.
Cloud Storage supports Amazon S3 ACL syntax in the following
scenarios:
In a request to Cloud Storage to retrieve ACLs (for example, a GET
Object or GET Bucket request), Cloud Storage returns Amazon S3
ACL syntax.
In a request to Cloud Storage to apply ACLs (for example, a PUT
Object or PUT Bucket request), Cloud Storage expects to receive
Amazon S3 ACL syntax.
The Authorization header in a simple migration scenario uses AWS for the
signature identifier, but with your Cloud Storage HMAC access ID.
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential= GOOG-ACCESS-ID / CREDENTIAL_SCOPE , SignedHeaders= SIGNED_HEADERS , Signature= SIGNATURE
The following example shows a GET request to Cloud Storage to return
the ACLs for an object.
GET europe/france/paris.jpg?acl HTTP/1.1
Host: my-travel-maps.storage.googleapis.com
Date: Thu, 21 Feb 2019 23:50:10 GMT
Content-Type: application/xml
X-Amz-Date: 20190221T235010Z
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=GOOGMC5PDPA5JLZYQMHQHRAX/20190221/region/s3/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date, Signature=29088b1d6dfeb2549f6ff67bc3744abb7e45475f0ad60400485805415bbfc534
The response to the request includes the ACL using Amazon S3 ACL syntax.
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

The following example shows a PUT request to Cloud Storage to set
the ACLs for an object. The example shows a request body with Amazon S3
ACL syntax.
PUT europe/france/paris.jpg?acl HTTP/1.1
Host: my-travel-maps.storage.googleapis.com

Finally, in a simple migration scenario, you can also use the GOOG1 signature
identifier in the Authorization header. In this case, you must use the
Cloud Storage ACL syntax and ensure that all of your x-amz-* headers
are changed to x-goog-* . While this is possible, we recommend that you choose
a full migration in order to use all the benefits of
Cloud Storage.
