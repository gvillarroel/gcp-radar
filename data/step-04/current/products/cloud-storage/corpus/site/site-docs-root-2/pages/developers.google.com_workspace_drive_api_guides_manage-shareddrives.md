Manage shared drives
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide contains tasks related to managing shared drives, such as creating
shared drives and managing members and permissions, using the Google Drive API.
If you want to specify the fields to return in the response, you can set the
fields system
parameter
with any method of the drives resource. If you
don't specify the fields parameter, the server returns a default set of fields
specific to the method. For example, the
list method returns only the kind , id ,
and name fields for each shared drive. For more information, see Return
specific fields .
To learn more about shared drive folder limits, see Shared drive folder
limits .
Create a shared drive
To create a shared drive, use the create
method on the drives resource with the
requestId parameter.
The requestId parameter identifies the logical attempt for idempotent creation
of a shared drive. If the request times out or returns an indeterminate backend
error, the same request can be repeated and won't create duplicates. The
requestId and body of the request must remain the same.
Note: If you're using the earlier Drive API v2, use the insert method. You can find code samples in
GitHub .
The following code sample shows how to create a shared drive:

Calls to the create method are
idempotent.
If the shared drive was successfully created on a previous request or due to a
retry, the method returns an instance of the drives resource. Sometimes, such
as after a prolonged time or if the body of the request has changed, a 409
error might be returned indicating the requestId must be discarded.
Get a shared drive
To get metadata for a shared drive, use the
get method on the drives resource with the driveId path parameter. If you
don't know the drive ID, you can list all shared drives
using the list method.
The get method returns a shared drive as an instance of a drives resource.
To issue the request as a domain administrator, set the useDomainAdminAccess
query parameter to true . For more information, see Manage shared drives as
domain administrators .
List shared drives
To list a user's shared drives, use the list
method on the drives resource. The method returns
a list of shared drives.
Pass the following query parameters to customize pagination of, or to filter,
shared drives:
pageSize : The maximum number of shared drives to return per page.
pageToken : A page token, received from a previous list call. Provide this
token to retrieve the subsequent page.
q : Query string for searching shared drives. For more information, see
Search for shared drives .
useDomainAdminAccess : Set to true to issue the request as a domain
administrator to return all shared drives of the domain in which the
requester is an administrator. For more information, see Manage shared
drives as domain administrators .
Update a shared drive
To update the metadata for a shared drive, use the update method on the
drives resource with the driveId path
parameter.
The method returns a shared drive as an instance of a drives resource.
To issue the request as a domain administrator, set the useDomainAdminAccess
query parameter to true . For more information, see Manage shared drives as
domain administrators .
Hide and unhide a shared drive
To hide a shared drive from the default view, use the hide method on the
drives resource with the driveId parameter.
When a shared drive is hidden, Drive marks the shared drive
resource as hidden=true . Hidden shared drives don't appear in the
Drive UI or in the list of returned files.
To restore a shared drive to the default view, use the unhide method on the
drives resource with the driveId parameter.
Both methods return a shared drive as an instance of a drives resource.
Delete a shared drive
To permanently delete a shared drive, use the
delete method on the drives resource with the driveId parameter.
Before deleting a shared drive, all content in the shared drive must be moved to
the trash or deleted. The user must also have role=organizer on the shared
drive folder. For more information, see Trash or delete files and folders .
Pass the following query parameters to filter shared drives:
useDomainAdminAccess : Set to true to issue the request as a domain
administrator to return all shared drives of the domain in which the
requester is an administrator. For more information, see Manage shared
drives as domain administrators .
allowItemDeletion : Set to true to delete items within the shared drive.
Only supported when useDomainAdminAccess is also set to true .
Add or remove shared drive members
Add or remove shared drive members using the
permissions resource.
To add a member, create the permission on the shared drive. Permission methods
can also be used on individual files within a shared drive to grant members
additional privileges or allow non-members to collaborate on specific items.
For more information and sample code, see Share files, folders, and drives .
Manage shared drives as domain administrators
Apply the useDomainAdminAccess parameter with the drives and permissions
resources to manage shared drives across an organization.
Users calling these methods with useDomainAdminAccess=true must have the
Drive and Docs administrator
privilege .
Administrators can search for shared
drives or update permissions for shared
drives owned by their organization, regardless of the administrator's membership
in any given shared drive.
When using service accounts, you might have to impersonate an authenticated
administrator using service account
impersonation .
Note that service accounts do not belong to your Google Workspace domain,
unlike user accounts. If you share Google Workspace assets, like documents or
events, with your entire Google Workspace domain, they're not shared with
service accounts. For more information, see Service accounts
overview .

Prevent users from downloading, printing, or copying your file
You can limit how users can download, print, and copy files within shared
drives.
To determine whether the user can change organizer-applied download restrictions
of a shared drive, check the capabilities.canChangeDownloadRestriction boolean field. If
capabilities.canChangeDownloadRestriction is set to true , download
restrictions can be applied to the shared drive. For more information, see
Understand file capabilities .
The drives resource contains a collection of
boolean restrictions
fields used to indicate whether an action can be performed on a shared drive.
Restrictions apply to a shared drive or items inside a shared drive.
Restrictions can be set using the drives.update method.
To apply download restrictions to a shared drive, a shared drive manager can set
the restrictions.downloadRestriction field of the drives
resource using the
DownloadRestriction object.
Setting the restrictedForReaders boolean field to true declares that both
download and copy are restricted for readers. Setting the restrictedForWriters
boolean field to true declares that both download and copy are restricted for
writers. Note that if the restrictedForWriters field is true , download and
copy is also restricted for readers. Similarly, setting restrictedForWriters
to true and restrictedForReaders to false is equivalent to setting both
restrictedForWriters and restrictedForReaders to true .
Backward compatibility
With the introduction of the DownloadRestriction object, the functionality of the
restrictions.copyRequiresWriterPermission
boolean field has been updated.
Now, setting restrictions.copyRequiresWriterPermission to true updates the
restrictedForReaders boolean field of the DownloadRestriction object to true to declare that
both download and copy are restricted for readers.
Setting the copyRequiresWriterPermission field to false updates both the
restrictedForWriters and restrictedForReaders fields to false . This means
download or copy restriction settings are removed for all users.
Warning: You should only use the legacy copyRequiresWriterPermission field
or the DownloadRestriction
object to set download, print, and copy restrictions. The fields are not meant
to be used together as the two field values might conflict.
Fields that control download, print, and copy features
The following table lists drives resource fields
that affect download, print, and copy functionality:
Field
Description
Version
capabilities.canCopy
Whether the current user can copy files in a shared drive.
v2 & v3
capabilities.canDownload
Whether the current user can download files in a shared drive.
v2 & v3
capabilities.canChangeCopyRequiresWriterPermission
Whether the current user can change the copyRequiresWriterPermission restriction of a shared drive.
v2 & v3
capabilities.canResetDriveRestrictions
Whether the current user can reset the shared drive restrictions to defaults.
v2 & v3
capabilities.canChangeDownloadRestriction
Whether the current user can change the download restriction of a shared drive.
v3 only
restrictions.copyRequiresWriterPermission
Whether the options to copy, print, or download files inside a shared drive are disabled for readers and commenters. When true , it sets the similarly named field to true for any file inside this shared drive.
v2 & v3
restrictions.downloadRestriction
The download restrictions applied by shared drive managers.
v3 only
Folder limits
Shared drive folders have some storage limits. For information, see Shared
drive limits in
Google Drive .
Item cap
Each user's shared drive has a limit of 500,000 items, including files, folders,
and shortcuts.
When the limit is reached, the shared drive can no longer accept items. To
resume receiving files, users must permanently delete items from the shared
drive. Note that items in the trash count toward the limit, but
permanently-deleted items don't. For more information, see Trash or delete
files and folders .
Folder-depth limit
A folder in a shared drive can't contain more than 100 levels of nested folders.
This means that a child folder cannot be stored under a folder that's more than
99 levels deep. This limitation only applies to child folders.
Attempts to add more than 100 levels of folders returns a
teamDriveHierarchyTooDeep
