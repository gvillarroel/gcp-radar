Protect file content
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Google Drive API supports several ways to prevent file modification, including
file content restriction and prohibiting the option to download, print, or copy
files.
Make files read-only with Drive content restrictions
You can add a content restriction to a Google Drive file to prevent users from
doing the following:
Modifying the title
Making content edits
Uploading a revision
Adding or modifying comments
A content restriction isn't an access restriction. While users cannot modify the
file's content, other operations are still allowed, based on their access level.
For example, a user with edit access can still move an item or change its
sharing settings.
To add or remove a content restriction on a file in Drive, a user
must have the associated permissions . For a
file or folder in My Drive or a shared drive with the
capabilities.canModifyEditorContentRestriction , you must have role=writer
assigned. For a file or folder in My Drive or a shared drive with
an ownerRestricted content restriction, you must own the file or have
role=organizer . To view an item with a content restriction, users must have
role=reader or higher. For a complete list of roles, see Roles and
permissions . To update permissions on a file, see
Update permissions .
You can use the contentRestrictions.readOnly boolean field on the files resource to set a content
restriction. Note that setting a content restriction on an item overwrites the
existing one.
Scenarios for content restrictions
A content restriction on a Drive item signals to users that the
contents shouldn't be changed. This can be for some of the following reasons:
Pausing work on a collaborative document during review or audit periods.
Setting an item to a finalized state, such as approved.
Preventing changes during a sensitive meeting.
Prohibiting external changes for workflows handled by automated systems.
Restricting edits by Google Apps Script and Google Workspace add-ons.
Avoiding accidental edits to a document.
Note though that while content restrictions can help manage content, it's not
meant to prevent users with sufficient permissions from continuing to work on an
item. Additionally, it isn't a way to create an immutable record.
Drive content restrictions are mutable, so a content restriction
on an item doesn't guarantee that the item never changes.
Manage files with content restrictions
Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides, as well as all other files,
can contain content restrictions.
A content restriction on an item prevents changes to its title and content,
including:
Comments and suggestions (on Docs, Sheets,
Slides, and binary files)
Revisions of a binary file
Text and formatting in Docs
Text or formulas in Sheets, a Sheets layout,
and instances in Sheets
All content in Slides, as well as the order and number of the
slides
Important: The preceding doesn't include the results of calculations in
Sheets, so the displayed contents of a sheet with a content
restriction might change if there are formulas in a sheet that reference
external data sources.
Certain file types can't contain a content restriction. A few examples are:
Google Forms
Google Sites
Google Drawings
Shortcuts and third-party shortcuts. For more information, see Create a
shortcut file to content stored by your
app and Create a shortcut to a
Drive file .
Add a content restriction
To add a file content restriction, use the
files.update method with the
contentRestrictions.readOnly field set to true . Add an optional reason for
why you're adding the restriction, such as "Finalized contract." The following
code sample shows how to add a content restriction:
Java
File updatedFile =
new File ()
. setContentRestrictions (
ImmutableList . of ( new ContentRestriction (). setReadOnly ( true ). setReason ( "Finalized contract." ));
File response = driveService . files (). update ( " FILE_ID " , updatedFile ). setFields ( "contentRestrictions" ). execute ();
Python
content_restriction = { 'readOnly' : True , 'reason' : 'Finalized contract.' }
response = drive_service . files () . update ( fileId = " FILE_ID " , body = { 'contentRestrictions' : [ content_restriction ]}, fields = "contentRestrictions" ) . execute ();
Node.js
/**
* Set a content restriction on a file.
* @return{obj} updated file
**/
async function addContentRestriction () {
// Get credentials and build service
// TODO (developer) - Use appropriate auth mechanism for your app
const { GoogleAuth } = require ( 'google-auth-library' );
const { google } = require ( 'googleapis' );
const auth = new GoogleAuth ({ scopes : 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive' });
const service = google . drive ({ version : 'v3' , auth });
const contentRestriction = {
'readOnly' : True ,
'reason' : 'Finalized contract.' ,
};
const updatedFile = {
'contentRestrictions' : [ contentRestriction ],
};
try {
const response = await service . files . update ({
fileId : ' FILE_ID ' ,
resource : updatedFile ,
fields : 'contentRestrictions' ,
});
return response ;
} catch ( err ) {
// TODO (developer) - Handle error
throw err ;
}
}
Replace FILE_ID with the fileId of the file that you want to
modify.
When you run the sample code, the file is content restricted and a lock symbol
( lock ) appears beside the filename within
the Google Drive user interface
(UI) . The file is now read-only.
Figure 1. A file with a content restriction within a Drive file list.
Remove a content restriction
To remove a file content restriction, use the files.update method with the
contentRestrictions.readOnly field set to false . The following code sample
shows how to remove a content restriction:
Java
File updatedFile =
new File ()
. setContentRestrictions (
ImmutableList . of ( new ContentRestriction (). setReadOnly ( false ));
File response = driveService . files (). update ( " FILE_ID " , updatedFile ). setFields ( "contentRestrictions" ). execute ();
Python
content_restriction = { 'readOnly' : False }
response = drive_service . files () . update ( fileId = " FILE_ID " , body = { 'contentRestrictions' : [ content_restriction ]}, fields = "contentRestrictions" ) . execute ();
Node.js
/**
* Remove a content restriction on a file.
* @return{obj} updated file
**/
async function removeContentRestriction () {
// Get credentials and build service
// TODO (developer) - Use appropriate auth mechanism for your app
const { GoogleAuth } = require ( 'google-auth-library' );
const { google } = require ( 'googleapis' );
const auth = new GoogleAuth ({ scopes : 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive' });
const service = google . drive ({ version : 'v3' , auth });
const contentRestriction = {
'readOnly' : False ,
};
const updatedFile = {
'contentRestrictions' : [ contentRestriction ],
};
try {
const response = await service . files . update ({
fileId : ' FILE_ID ' ,
resource : updatedFile ,
fields : 'contentRestrictions' ,
});
return response ;
} catch ( err ) {
// TODO (developer) - Handle error
throw err ;
}
}
Replace FILE_ID with the fileId of the file that you want to
modify.
When you run the sample code, the file is no longer content restricted.
You can also use the Drive UI to remove a content restriction and
allow content editing (provided you have the correct permissions). There are two
options to do this:
In Drive, right-click the file with a content restriction and
click Unlock lock_open .
Figure 2. Remove a file content restriction within a Drive file list.
Open the file with a content restriction and click (Locked mode)
lock >
Unlock file .
Figure 3. Remove a file content restriction within a document.
Check for a content restriction
To check for a content restriction, use the
files.get method with the
contentRestrictions returned field. The following code sample shows how to
check the status of a content restriction:
Java
File response = driveService . files (). get ( " FILE_ID " ). setFields ( "contentRestrictions" ). execute ();
Python
response = drive_service . files () . get ( fileId = " FILE_ID " , fields = "contentRestrictions" ) . execute ();
Node.js
/**
* Get content restrictions on a file.
* @return{obj} updated file
**/
async function fetchContentRestrictions () {
// Get credentials and build service
// TODO (developer) - Use appropriate auth mechanism for your app
const { GoogleAuth } = require ( 'google-auth-library' );
const { google } = require ( 'googleapis' );
const auth = new GoogleAuth ({ scopes : 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive' });
const service = google . drive ({ version : 'v3' , auth });
try {
const response = await service . files . get ({
fileId : ' FILE_ID ' ,
fields : 'contentRestrictions' ,
});
return response ;
} catch ( err ) {
// TODO (developer) - Handle error
throw err ;
}
}
Replace FILE_ID with the fileId of the file that you want to
check.
When you run the sample code, the method returns a ContentRestriction resource if present.
Add a content restriction only the file owner can modify
To add a file content restriction so only file owners can toggle the mechanism,
use the files.update method with the
contentRestrictions.ownerRestricted boolean field set to true . The following
code sample shows how to add a content restriction for file owners only:
Java
File updatedFile =
new File ()
. setContentRestrictions (
ImmutableList . of ( new ContentRestriction (). setReadOnly ( true ). setOwnerRestricted ( true ). setReason ( "Finalized contract." ));
File response = driveService . files (). update ( " FILE_ID " , updatedFile ). setFields ( "contentRestrictions" ). execute ();
Python
content_restriction = { 'readOnly' : True , 'ownerRestricted' : True , 'reason' : 'Finalized contract.' }
response = drive_service . files () . update ( fileId = " FILE_ID " , body = { 'contentRestrictions' : [ content_restriction ]}, fields = "contentRestrictions" ) . execute ();
Node.js
/**
* Set an owner restricted content restriction on a file.
* @return{obj} updated file
**/
async function addOwnerRestrictedContentRestriction () {
// Get credentials and build service
// TODO (developer) - Use appropriate auth mechanism for your app
const { GoogleAuth } = require ( 'google-auth-library' );
const { google } = require ( 'googleapis' );
const auth = new GoogleAuth ({ scopes : 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive' });
const service = google . drive ({ version : 'v3' , auth });
const contentRestriction = {
'readOnly' : True ,
'ownerRestricted' : True ,
'reason' : 'Finalized contract.' ,
};
const updatedFile = {
'contentRestrictions' : [ contentRestriction ],
};
try {
const response = await service . files . update ({
fileId : ' FILE_ID ' ,
resource : updatedFile ,
fields : 'contentRestrictions' ,
});
return response ;
} catch ( err ) {
// TODO (developer) - Handle error
throw err ;
}
}
Replace FILE_ID with the fileId of the file that you want to
modify.
When you run the sample code, the file is content restricted and only file
owners can remove it. If you're the file owner, an active lock symbol ( lock ) appears beside the filename within the
Drive user interface
(UI) . If you're not the owner, the
lock symbol is dimmed.
To remove the ownerRestricted flag, use the files.update method with the
contentRestrictions.ownerRestricted field set to false .
Important: A My Drive file has a single owner so only they can
modify the content restriction. A shared drive owns the shared drive file, so
any user with role=organizer permissions on the shared drive can modify or
remove the ownerRestricted flag.
Content restriction capabilities
A files resource contains a collection of boolean
capabilities fields used to indicate whether an action can be performed on a
file.
Content restrictions contain the following capabilities :
capabilities.canModifyEditorContentRestriction : Whether the current user
can add or modify a content restriction .
capabilities.canModifyOwnerContentRestriction : Whether the current user
can add or modify an owner content restriction .
capabilities.canRemoveContentRestriction : Whether the current user can
remove the applied content restriction (if present).
For more information, see Understand file
capabilities .
For an example of retrieving file capabilities , see Get file capabilities .
Prevent users from downloading, printing, or copying your file
You can limit how users can download, print, and copy files within
Drive, Docs, Sheets, and
Slides.
To determine whether the user can change owner or organizer-applied download
restrictions of a file, check the
capabilities.canChangeItemDownloadRestriction boolean field. If
capabilities.canChangeItemDownloadRestriction is set to true , download
restrictions can be applied to the file. For more information, see Understand
file capabilities .
To apply download restrictions to a file, set the downloadRestrictions field using the
files.update method. You can set the field
using the
DownloadRestrictionsMetadata
object.
The DownloadRestrictionsMetadata object has two fields:
itemDownloadRestriction and effectiveDownloadRestrictionWithContext . Both
fields are readable but only the itemDownloadRestriction can be set. The
itemDownloadRestriction field returns a DownloadRestriction object. The DownloadRestriction
object has two separate boolean fields: restrictedForReaders and
restrictedForWriters .
When setting the itemDownloadRestriction field the download restriction of the
file is applied directly by the owner or organizer. It doesn't account for
shared drive settings or data loss prevention (DLP) rules. For more information,
see About DLP .
If you update the itemDownloadRestriction field by setting the
restrictedForWriters field to true , it implies that restrictedForReaders
is true . Similarly, setting restrictedForWriters to true and
restrictedForReaders to false is equivalent to setting both
restrictedForWriters and restrictedForReaders to true .
For the effectiveDownloadRestrictionWithContext field the download restriction
is applied to the file and it accounts for all restriction settings and DLP
rules.
The effectiveDownloadRestrictionWithContext field can be set to either
restrictedForWriters or restrictedForReaders . If there's any download or
copy restriction settings for the corresponding roles from file settings, shared
drive settings, or DLP rules (including those ones with context), then the value
is set to true , otherwise it's false .
Backward compatibility
We recommend that you use the
DownloadRestriction object to
enforce how users can download, print, and copy files.
If you want to use the
copyRequiresWriterPermission
boolean field, the functionality is different for both reading from and writing
to the field.
The retrieved value of the copyRequiresWriterPermission field reflects whether
users with the role=commenter or role=reader permission can download, print,
or copy files within Drive. The field value reflects the
combination of file settings, shared drive settings, or DLP rules. However,
context evaluation for DLP rules isn't included.
Setting the copyRequiresWriterPermission field to false updates both the
restrictedForWriters and restrictedForReaders fields to false . This means
download or copy restriction settings are removed for all users.
Warning: You should only use the legacy copyRequiresWriterPermission field
or the DownloadRestriction
object to set download, print, and copy restrictions. The fields are not meant
to be used together as the two field values might conflict.
Fields that control download, print, and copy features
The following table lists files resource fields
that affect download, print, and copy functionality:
Field
Description
Version
capabilities.canCopy
Whether the current user can copy a file.
v2 & v3
capabilities.canDownload
Whether the current user can download a file.
v2 & v3
capabilities.canChangeCopyRequiresWriterPermission
Whether the current user can change the copyRequiresWriterPermission restriction of a file.
v2 & v3
capabilities.canChangeItemDownloadRestriction
Whether the current user can change the download restriction of a file.
v3 only
copyRequiresWriterPermission
Whether the options to copy, print, or download this file, should be disabled for readers and commenters.
v2 & v3
downloadRestrictions

Note: Within the files resource several download and copy fields are marked as
deprecated. This means the field is obsolete. However, a deprecated field might
still be available and functional through the deprecated phase. Continued or
future use of deprecated fields is discouraged. Developers should plan to
migrate to the preferred alternative mentioned in the deprecated field's
description.
