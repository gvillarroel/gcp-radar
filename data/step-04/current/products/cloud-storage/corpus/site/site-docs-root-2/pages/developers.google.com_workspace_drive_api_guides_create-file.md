Create and manage files
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide explains how to create and manage files in Google Drive using the
Google Drive API.
Create file
To create a file in Drive that contains no metadata or content,
use the create method on the files resource with no parameters.
When you create the file, the method returns a files resource. The file is
given a kind of drive.file , an id , a name of "Untitled", and a
mimeType of application/octet-stream . The
uploadType
is marked as required but defaults to media , so you don't actually have to
supply it.
For more information about Drive file limits, see File and
folder limits .
Note: When a Drive user wants to download a file, or when the
file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full
filename (with extension) based on the name. In cases where the extension is
missing, Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the
file's MIME type .
Use the fields parameter
If you want to specify the fields to return in the response, you can set the
fields system
parameter
with any method of the files resource. If you omit the fields parameter, the
server returns a default set of fields specific to the method. For example, the
list method returns only the kind , id ,
name , mimeType , and resourceKey fields for each file. To return different
fields, see Return specific fields .
File ownership
When a file is created using the Drive API, ownership depends on the
authentication credentials used by the app in the following ways:
User account (OAuth 2.0) : If the application authenticates on behalf of
a user, that user becomes the file owner. The file then resides in their My
Drive folder or a specified
folder . It consumes their storage quota.
Service Account : If the application authenticates using a Service
Account, the Service Account is the file owner. The file then resides in the
Service Account's dedicated Drive storage. Files don't appear
within other Drive storage accounts unless explicitly shared.
If the Service Account is deleted, all files it owns are deleted
immediately.
If you're using a Service Account but want a specific user account to own a
file, use Domain-Wide Delegation. This allows the Service Account to
impersonate a user and to create files on their behalf. For more
information, see Delegate domain-wide authority to the service
account .
For more information about file permissions, see Share files, folders, and
drives .
Generate IDs to use with your files
The generateIds method on the
files resource lets you pre-generate unique file
IDs that can be used when creating or copying files and folders in
Drive. This can be useful when you need to control the file IDs
from your app, rather than letting Drive assign them
automatically.
You can set the number of IDs generated using the
count query parameter.
If count is not set, 10 are returned by default. The maximum number of IDs you
can request is capped at 1,000.
You can also designate the
space in which the IDs
can be used and the
type of items which the
IDs can be used for.
Once an ID is generated, it can be passed to the create or copy method
through the id field. This ensures that the created or copied file uses the
predetermined ID.
If the file is successfully created or copied, subsequent retries return a 409
Conflict HTTP status code response and duplicate files aren't created.
Note that pre-generated IDs aren't supported for the creation of
Google Workspace files, except for the application/vnd.google-apps.drive-sdk
and application/vnd.google-apps.folder MIME
types . Similarly, uploads referencing a conversion
to a Google Workspace file format aren't supported.
Create metadata-only files
Metadata-only files contain no content. Metadata is data (such as name ,
mimeType , and createdTime ) that describes the file. Fields like name are
user-agnostic and appear the same for each user, whereas fields such as
viewedByMeTime contain user-specific values.
One example of a metadata-only file is a folder with the MIME type
application/vnd.google-apps.folder . For more information, see Create and
populate folders . Another example is a shortcut that
points to another file on Drive with the MIME type
application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut . For more information, see Create a
shortcut to a Drive file .
Manage thumbnail images
Thumbnails help users identify Drive files. Drive
can automatically generate thumbnails for common file types or you can provide a
thumbnail image generated by your app. For more information, see Upload
thumbnails .
Copy an existing file
To copy a file, and apply any requested updates, use the copy method on the files resource. To find the
fileId to copy, use the list method.
You can apply updates through patch semantics, meaning you can make partial
modifications to a resource. You must explicitly set the fields that you intend
to modify in your request. Any fields not included in the request retain their
existing values. For more information, see Working with partial resources .
You can pre-set the file ID of the copied file using the generateIds method. For more information, see
Generate IDs to use with your files .
Note that you need to use an appropriate Drive API
scope to authorize the
call. For more information on Drive scopes, see Choose
Google Drive API scopes .
Limits and considerations
As you prepare to copy files, take note of these limits and considerations:
Permissions :
The DownloadRestrictionsMetadata
object of the files resource determines
who can copy the file. For more information, see Prevent users from
downloading, printing, or copying your
file .
The capabilities.canCopy
field resource determines whether the user can copy a file. For more
information, see Understand file
capabilities .
The user that created the copy owns the copied file. No other sharing
settings from the source file are replicated. If the copy is created in
a shared folder, it inherits the permissions of that folder.
A copied file's ownership might change and the copy might not inherit
the original file's sharing settings. These settings might need to be
reset.
File management :
Some files, like third-party
shortcuts , can never be copied.
You can only copy a file into one parent folder. Specifying multiple
parents isn't supported. If the
parents field isn't
specified, the file inherits any discoverable parents from the source
file.
Even though a folder is a type of file, you can't copy a folder.
Instead, create a destination folder and set the parents field of the
existing files to the destination folder. You can then delete the
original source folder.
Unless a new filename is specified, the copy method produces a file
with the same name as the original.
Excessive use of copy can lead to exceeding your Drive API
quota limits. For more information, see Usage
limits .
