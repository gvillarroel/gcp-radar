Transition from gsutil to gcloud storage
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
gcloud storage (General Availability) is the recommended command-line tool for
interacting with Cloud Storage. This page helps you transition from gsutil
to gcloud storage by describing the major differences and command mappings
between the two tools. For a detailed description of the gcloud storage tool,
see the gcloud storage reference documentation .
To learn how to install and get started using the Google Cloud CLI, see
Install the Google Cloud CLI .
Behavioral differences
The following sections describe the behavioral differences between gsutil and
gcloud storage .
Parallel invocations
gcloud storage doesn't support parallel invocations using multiple terminals
on the same machine.
Parallel processing
gcloud storage supports parallel processing.
Wildcard handling
gcloud storage simplifies multiple asterisks. If you use three or more
asterisks in a row ( *** ), it treats them as a single asterisk ( * ).
Handling of hierarchical namespace buckets
gcloud storage can be used to create and manage buckets with
hierarchical namespace enabled.
Support for local-to-local file copying
gcloud storage is designed exclusively for interacting with Cloud Storage
and doesn't support local-to-local file copying. To move data successfully using
gcloud storage , at least one argument (source or destination) must be a
Cloud Storage resource URI. For example: gs://my-bucket .
Output formatting
The gcloud storage and gsutil commands format their output differently.
While minor changes like logging format might not affect you, more significant
differences in error messages and data listings can break automated scripts.
If you have scripts that rely on parsing gsutil command output, you should
review and update them for the gcloud storage format before transitioning
them.
gcloud command equivalents
All existing gsutil commands have equivalent commands in gcloud storage ,
with a few exceptions. You can get a full list of the
gcloud storage commands by visiting the reference documentation
or by running gcloud storage --help . The following table briefly outlines the
changes from popular gsutil commands.
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Manage Access Control Lists (ACLs)
gsutil acl get
gsutil acl set
gsutil acl ch
gcloud storage RESOURCE describe --format="multi(acl:format=json)"
gcloud storage RESOURCE update --acl-file= ACL_FILE_PATH
gcloud storage RESOURCE update --add-acl-grant= GRANT
gcloud storage RESOURCE update --remove-acl-grant= GRANT
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Concatenate objects and display object content
gsutil cat
gcloud storage cat
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Concatenate objects by combining them into a new object
gsutil compose
gcloud storage objects compose
Notes
To apply preconditions in
gcloud storage objects compose , use
specific flags, such as --if-generation-match or
--if-metageneration-match .
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Copy objects and other resources
gsutil cp
gcloud storage cp
Notes
Simulated folders
created using the Google Cloud console are recognized as
0-byte placeholder objects. gcloud storage cp can be used to copy
simulated folders, whereas gsutil cp cannot.
When handling errors, gcloud storage cp attempts to copy all
resources, even if one of the resources is invalid or doesn't exist.
gsutil cp might stop the entire operation as soon as it encounters
an invalid resource.
When downloading an object, gcloud storage cp creates any
missing local directories that are specified in the destination path.
gsutil cp fails if the destination directory doesn't exist.
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Display the total disk space used by objects
gsutil du
gcloud storage du
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Calculate file hashes
gsutil hash
gcloud storage hash
Notes
gsutil hash uses additive flags to include specific hashes,
such as -c or -m . gcloud storage hash
uses subtractive flags to exclude hashes, such as --skip-md5 or
--skip-crc32c .
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Manage bucket labels
gsutil label get
gsutil label set
gsutil label ch
gcloud storage buckets describe
gcloud storage buckets update
gcloud storage buckets update
Notes
The combination of adding, updating, and removing labels in a single
gsutil label ch command can behave differently than the equivalent
operations using gcloud storage buckets update . Scripts relying on
specific read-modify-write behavior of gsutil should be tested
carefully after transitioning to gcloud storage .
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
List buckets, objects, and folders
gsutil ls
gcloud storage ls
Notes
When a wildcard is used to list objects in a project, gsutil ls
returns a flat list of objects, whereas gcloud storage ls returns
objects grouped by bucket name.
When using gcloud storage ls -L to return detailed listings as
output, the following behaviors apply:
The labels for each piece of metadata (also known as a "key") has the first
letter of each word capitalized.
If a piece of metadata for an object doesn't have a value,
gcloud storage omits that line from the output.
gcloud storage always outputs datetimes in UTC.
gcloud storage returns any error messages at the end of the
command's output.
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Move and rename objects or directories
gsutil mv
gcloud storage mv
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Rewrite objects in place
gsutil rewrite
gcloud storage objects update
Notes
If an encryption_key is set in your boto configuration file,
gsutil rewrite -k applies the key to the objects. If
encryption_key isn't set, the equivalent of
gsutil rewrite -k is
gcloud storage objects update --clear-encryption-key . This removes
any customer-supplied encryption keys (CSEK) or customer-managed encryption keys
(CMEK) from the object. The object is then encrypted with the bucket's default
KMS key or with Google-managed encryption.
gsutil rewrite includes logic to skip rewriting an object if
the requested transformation wouldn't change its state (for example, if the
object is already in a target storage class).
gcloud storage objects update might not perform the same checks,
potentially leading to unnecessary operations.
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Remove objects or buckets
gsutil rm
gcloud storage rm
Notes
The gsutil aliases del , delete , and
remove aren't supported.
There's a known issue where gsutil and
gcloud storage behave differently when the -l and
-r flags are used together. Scripts that pipe a list of directories
to be recursively deleted should be thoroughly tested before transitioning
from using gsutil to gcloud storage .
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Synchronize the contents of two buckets or directories
gsutil rsync
gcloud storage rsync
Notes
By default, gsutil rsync considers an object unchanged if its
size and last modification time match between the source and destination.
It only performs a more thorough checksum comparison if an object is missing
its modification time, or if you manually force it to with the -c
flag. gcloud storage rsync also starts by checking a file's size
and last modification time; however, if the object sizes match but the
modification times differ or are missing, it automatically performs a checksum
comparison.
gcloud storage rsync performs operations in parallel by default
for better performance. gsutil rsync runs sequentially unless the
top-level -m flag is used.
gsutil rsync follows symbolic links by default.
gcloud storage rsync ignores them by default unless the
--no-ignore-symlinks flag is used.
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Set metadata on uploaded objects
gsutil setmeta
gcloud storage objects update
Notes
gsutil setmeta uses a single, repeatable -h flag
to specify which metadata to set or remove.
gcloud storage objects update uses distinct flags for each
metadata field (for example: --content-type ,
--clear-cache-control , or --update-custom-metadata ).
In gsutil setmeta , the -h flag is used to set
the full header name (for example:
-h "x-goog-meta-icecreamflavor:vanilla" ). In
gcloud storage objects update , the
--update-custom-metadata flag is used instead and takes key-value
pairs (for example:
--update-custom-metadata=icecreamflavor=vanilla ). To remove a
custom metadata field, gsutil setmeta uses
-h "x-goog-meta-icecreamflavor" while
gcloud storage objects update uses
--remove-custom-metadata=icecreamflavor .
Operation
gsutil command
gcloud storage command
Display object status
gsutil stat
gcloud storage objects list --stat --fetch-encrypted-object-hashes
Notes
The output format of gcloud storage objects list --stat differs
from the output format of gsutil stat , with known issues related
to inconsistent spacing. Scripts that were written to parse the output of
gsutil stat might require adjustments to handle the new output
format.
