Troubleshooting
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes troubleshooting methods for common errors you may encounter
while using Cloud Storage.
See the Google Cloud Service Health Dashboard for information about
incidents affecting Google Cloud services such as Cloud Storage.
Logging raw requests
Important: Never share your credentials. When you print out HTTP protocol
details, your authentication credentials, such as OAuth 2.0 tokens, are visible
in the headers. If you need to post request or response details to a message
board or need to supply them for troubleshooting, make sure that you sanitize or
revoke any credentials that appear as part of the output.
When using tools such as gcloud or the Cloud Storage client libraries, much
of the request and response information is handled by the tool. However, it is
sometimes useful to see details to aid in troubleshooting or when posting
questions to forums such as Stack Overflow . Use the
following instructions to return request and response headers for your tool:
Console
Viewing request and response information depends on the browser you're using
to access the Google Cloud console. For the Google Chrome browser:
Click Chrome's main menu button
( more_vert ).
Select More Tools .
Click Developer Tools .
In the pane that appears, click the Network tab.
Command line
Use global debugging flags in your request. For example:
gcloud storage ls gs://my-bucket/my-object --log-http --verbosity=debug
Client libraries
C++
Set the environment variable CLOUD_STORAGE_ENABLE_TRACING=http to
get the full HTTP traffic.
Set the environment variable CLOUD_STORAGE_ENABLE_CLOG=yes to get
logging of each RPC.
C#
Add a logger via ApplicationContext.RegisterLogger , and set logging
options on the HttpClient message handler. For more information, see
the C# client library reference documentation .
Go
Set the environment variable GODEBUG=http2debug=1 . For more
information, see the Go package net/http .
If you want to log the request body as well,
use a custom HTTP client .
Java
Create a file named "logging.properties" with the following contents:
# Properties file which configures the operation of the JDK logging facility.
# The system will look for this config file to be specified as a system property:
# -Djava.util.logging.config.file=${project_loc:googleplus-simple-cmdline-sample}/logging.properties
# Set up the console handler (uncomment "level" to show more fine-grained messages)
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = CONFIG
# Set up logging of HTTP requests and responses (uncomment "level" to show)
com.google.api.client.http.level = CONFIG
Use logging.properties with Maven
mvn -Djava.util.logging.config.file=path/to/logging.properties insert_command
For more information, see Pluggable HTTP Transport .
Node.js
Set the environment variable NODE_DEBUG=https before calling the Node
script.
PHP
Provide your own HTTP handler to the client using
httpHandler and set up middleware to log the request
and response.
Python
Use the logging module . For example:
import logging
import http.client
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
http.client.HTTPConnection.debuglevel=5
Ruby
At the top of your .rb file after require "google/cloud/storage" ,
add the following:
ruby
Google::Apis.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
Adding custom headers
Adding custom headers to requests is a common tool for debugging purposes, such
as for enabling debug headers or for tracing a request. The following example
shows how to set request headers for different Cloud Storage tools:
Command line
Use the --additional-headers flag, which is available for most
commands. For example:
gcloud storage objects describe gs://my-bucket/my-object --additional-headers= HEADER_NAME = HEADER_VALUE
Where HEADER_NAME and
HEADER_VALUE define the header you are adding
to the request.
Note: The --additional-headers flag is not available for all
gcloud storage commands, such as commands working with
Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and buckets notifications commands.
Client libraries
C++
namespace gcs = google :: cloud :: storage ;
gcs :: Client client = ...;
client . AnyFunction (... args ..., gcs :: CustomHeader ( "header-name" , "value" ));
Note: The C++ client library supports only one custom header at a time.
C#
The following sample adds a custom header to every request made by the
client library.
using Google.Cloud.Storage.V1 ;
var client = StorageClient . Create ();
client . Service . HttpClient . DefaultRequestHeaders . Add ( "custom-header" , "custom-value" );
var buckets = client . ListBuckets ( "my-project-id" );
foreach ( var bucket in buckets )
{
Console . WriteLine ( bucket . Name );
}
Go
You can add custom headers to any API call made by the Storage package
by using callctx.SetHeaders on the context which is passed to the
method.
package main
import (
"context"
"cloud.google.com/go/storage"
"github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2/callctx"
)
func main () {
ctx := context . Background ()
client , err := storage . NewClient ( ctx )
if err != nil {
// Handle error.
}
ctx = callctx . SetHeaders ( ctx , "X-Custom-Header" , "value" )
// Use client as usual with the context and the additional headers will be sent.
_ , err = client . Bucket ( "my-bucket" ). Attrs ( ctx )
if err != nil {
// Handle error.
}
}
Java
import com.google.api.gax.rpc. FixedHeaderProvider ;
import com.google.api.gax.rpc. HeaderProvider ;
import com.google.cloud. WriteChannel ;
import com.google.cloud.storage. BlobInfo ;
import com.google.cloud.storage. Storage ;
import com.google.cloud.storage. StorageOptions ;
import java.io.IOException ;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer ;
import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8 ;
public class Example {
public void main ( String args [] ) throws IOException {
HeaderProvider headerProvider =
FixedHeaderProvider . create ( "custom-header" , "custom-value" );
Storage storage = StorageOptions . getDefaultInstance ()
. toBuilder ()
. setHeaderProvider ( headerProvider )
. build (). getService ();
String bucketName = "example-bucket" ;
String blobName = "test-custom-header" ;
// Use client with custom header
BlobInfo blob = BlobInfo . newBuilder ( bucketName , blobName ). build ();
byte [] stringBytes ;
try ( WriteChannel writer = storage . writer ( blob )) {
stringBytes = "hello world" . getBytes ( UTF_8 );
writer . write ( ByteBuffer . wrap ( stringBytes ));
}
}
}
Node.js
const storage = new Storage ();
storage . interceptors . push ({
request : requestConfig = > {
Object . assign ( requestConfig . headers , {
'X-Custom-Header' : 'value' ,
});
return requestConfig ;
},
});
PHP
All method calls which trigger http requests accept an optional
$restOptions argument as the last argument. You can provide custom
headers on a per-request basis, or on a per-client basis.
use Google\Cloud\Storage\StorageClient;
$client = new StorageClient([
'restOptions' => [
'headers' => [
'x-foo' => 'bat'
]
]
]);
$bucket = $client->bucket('my-bucket');
$bucket->info([
'restOptions' => [
'headers' => [
'x-foo' => 'bar'
]
]
]);
Python
from google.cloud import storage
client = storage . Client (
extra_headers = {
"x-custom-header" : "value"
}
)
Ruby
require "google/cloud/storage"
storage = Google :: Cloud :: Storage . new
storage . add_custom_headers { 'X-Custom-Header' = > 'value' }
Accessing buckets with a CORS configuration
If you have set a CORS configuration on your bucket and notice that incoming
requests from client browsers are failing, try the following troubleshooting
steps:
Review the CORS configuration on the target bucket. If there are
multiple CORS configuration entries, make sure that the request values
you use for troubleshooting map to values in a single CORS configuration
entry.
When testing issuing a CORS request, check that you are not making a request
to the storage.cloud.google.com endpoint, which doesn't allow CORS requests.
For more information about supported endpoints for CORS, see
Cloud Storage CORS support .
Review a request and response using the tool of your choice. In a Chrome
browser, you can use the standard developer tools to see this information:
Click the Chrome menu
( more_vert ) on the
browser toolbar.
Select More Tools > Developer Tools .
Click the Network tab.
From your application or command line, send the request.
In the pane displaying the network activity, locate the request.
In the Name column, click the name corresponding to the request.
Click the Headers tab to see the response headers, or the
Response tab to see the content of the response.
If you don't see a request and response, it's possible that your
browser has cached an earlier failed preflight request attempt. Clearing
your browser's cache should also clear the preflight cache. If it doesn't,
set the MaxAgeSec value in your CORS configuration to a lower value than
the default value of 3600 (60 minutes), wait for however long
the old MaxAgeSec was, then try the request again. This performs a new
preflight request, which fetches the new CORS configuration and purges the
cache entries. Once you have debugged your problem, raise MaxAgeSec back
to a higher value to reduce the preflight traffic to your bucket.
Ensure that the request has an Origin header and that the header value
matches at least one of the Origins values in the bucket's CORS
configuration. Note that the scheme, host, and port of the values must
match exactly. Some examples of acceptable matches are the following:
http://origin.example.com matches http://origin.example.com:80
(because 80 is the default HTTP port) but doesn't match
https://origin.example.com , http://origin.example.com:8080 ,
http://origin.example.com:5151 , or http://sub.origin.example.com .
https://example.com:443 matches https://example.com but not
http://example.com or http://example.com:443 .
http://localhost:8080 only matches exactly http://localhost:8080 and
doesn't match http://localhost:5555 or
http://localhost.example.com:8080 .
For simple requests, ensure that the HTTP method of the request matches at
least one of the Methods values in the bucket's CORS configuration. For
preflight requests, ensure that the method specified in
Access-Control-Request-Method matches at least one of the Methods values.
For preflight requests, check if it includes one or more
Access-Control-Request-Header headers. If so, ensure that each
Access-Control-Request-Header value matches a ResponseHeader value in
the bucket's CORS configuration. All headers named in the
Access-Control-Request-Header must be in the CORS configuration for the
preflight request to succeed and include CORS headers in the response.
Error codes
The following are common HTTP status codes you may encounter.
301: Moved Permanently
Issue : I'm setting up a static website , and accessing a directory path
returns an empty object and a 301 HTTP response code.
Solution : If your browser downloads a zero byte object and you get a 301
HTTP response code when accessing a directory, such as
http://www.example.com/dir/ , your bucket most likely contains an empty object
of that name. To check that this is the case and fix the issue:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage Buckets page.
Go to Buckets
Click the Activate Cloud Shell button at the top of the Google Cloud console.
Run gcloud storage ls --recursive gs://www.example.com/dir/ . If the output
includes http://www.example.com/dir/ , you have an empty object at that
location.
Remove the empty object with the command:
gcloud storage rm gs://www.example.com/dir/
You can now access http://www.example.com/dir/ and have it return that
directory's index.html file instead of the empty object.
400: Bad Request
Issue : While performing a resumable upload , I received this error and
the message Failed to parse Content-Range header.
Solution : The value you used in your Content-Range header is invalid. For
example, Content-Range: */* is invalid and instead should be specified as
Content-Range: bytes */* . If you receive this error, your current resumable
upload is no longer active, and you must start a new resumable upload.
400: Storage Intelligence Specific Errors
The following sections describe common errors that you might encounter when you
configure or manage Storage Intelligence for a resource.
400: Invalid Bucket Name
Issue : When you configure or manage Storage Intelligence for a resource, you
might receive this error and the message The specific bucket is not valid.
Solution : The URL that you used in the request is invalid. The URL must meet
the following requirements:
locations/global is the only supported location for
Storage Intelligence. Using any other location is unsupported.
Storage Intelligence is singular in the URL, not plural.
The following is an example of a valid URL:
curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d
'{"edition_config": "STANDARD" }'
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" "https://storage.googleapis.com/v2/projects/my-project/locations/global/storageIntelligence?updateMask=edition_config"
400: Invalid Argument - Empty Update Mask
Issue : When you configure or manage Storage Intelligence for a resource, you
might receive this error and the message Empty UPDATE_MASK in the request.
Solution : UPDATE_MASK is the comma-separated list of field names that the
request updates. The field names use the
FieldMask
format and are part of the
intelligenceConfig
resource. To update the Storage Intelligence configuration of a resource, use a valid UPDATE_MASK in the request. An
empty value is not supported.
400: Invalid Update Mask Path
Issue : When you configure or manage Storage Intelligence for a resource, you
might receive this error and the message Invalid UPDATE_MASK paths.
Solution : If you use an invalid field name in the UPDATE_MASK , you get an
error message. UPDATE_MASK is the comma-separated list of field names that the
request updates. The field names use the
FieldMask
format and are part of the
IntelligenceConfig resource.
To update the Storage Intelligence configuration of a resource, ensure
that every field name listed in the UPDATE_MASK is a valid field within the
IntelligenceConfig resource.
400: Field Is Not Editable
Issue : When you configure or manage Storage Intelligence for a resource, you
might receive this error and the message Invalid UPDATE_MASK: UPDATE_TIME field is not editable.
Solution : UPDATE_MASK is the comma-separated list of field names that the
request updates. The field names use the
FieldMask
format and are part of the
IntelligenceConfig resource. If you try to update a field that is not editable, you get an error message. Remove the uneditable field from the Update_Mask and try again.
400: Invalid Value
Issue : When you configure or manage Storage Intelligence for a resource, you
might receive this error and the message Invalid value at storage_intelligence.edition_config.
Solution : If you try to use an invalid value for the edition_config field,
you get an error message. The allowed values are INHERIT , STANDARD , and
DISABLED . Review the value and try again.
400: Non-empty Filter
Issue : When you update the Storage Intelligence configuration for a resource, you
might receive this error and the message Non-empty filter cannot be specified for INHERIT or DISABLED edition configuration.
Solution : When you update the Storage Intelligence edition_config to INHERIT or DISABLED , you can't use any bucket filters in the request. Remove the filters from the request and try again.
400: Empty Location Or Bucket Values In Filter
Issue : When you update the Storage Intelligence configuration for a resource, you
might receive this error and the message Empty location or bucket values in filter.
Solution : When you update the Storage Intelligence configuration and use a bucket
filter in the request, an error occurs if the value of location or
bucket is an empty string. Provide a valid value for location or bucket and
try again.
401: Unauthorized
Issue : Requests to a public bucket directly, or using Cloud CDN, are
failing with a HTTP 401: Unauthorized and an Authentication Required
response.
Solution : Check that your client, or any intermediate proxy, is not adding an
Authorization header to requests to Cloud Storage. Any request with
an Authorization header, even if empty, is validated as if it were an
authentication attempt.
403: Account Disabled
Issue : I tried to create a bucket but got a 403 Account Disabled error.
Solution : This error indicates that you have not yet turned on billing for
the associated project. For steps for enabling billing, see
Enable billing for a project .
If billing is turned on and you continue to receive this error message, you can
reach out to support with your project ID and a description of your
problem.
403: Forbidden
Issue : I should have permission to access a certain bucket or object, but
when I attempt to do so, I get a 403 - Forbidden error with a message that is
similar to: example@email.com doesn't have storage.objects.get access to the
Google Cloud Storage object .
Solution : You are missing an IAM permission for the bucket
or object that is required to complete the request. If you expect to be able to
make the request but can't, perform the following checks:
Is the grantee referenced in the error message the one you expected? If the
error message refers to an unexpected email address or to "Anonymous
caller", then your request is not using the credentials you intended. This
could be because the tool you are using to make the request was set up with
the credentials from another alias or entity, or it could be because the
request is being made on your behalf by a service account .
Is the permission referenced in the error message one thought you needed? If
the permission is unexpected, it's likely because the tool you're using
requires additional access in order to complete your request. For example,
in order to bulk delete objects in a bucket, gcloud must first construct
a list of objects in the bucket to delete. This portion of the bulk delete
action requires the storage.objects.list permission, which might be
surprising, given that the goal is object deletion, which normally requires
only the storage.objects.delete permission. If this is the cause of your
error message, make sure you're granted IAM roles that
have the additional necessary permissions.
Are you granted the IAM role on the intended resource or
parent resource? For example, if you're granted the Storage Object Viewer
role for a project and you're trying to download an object, make sure the
object is in a bucket that's in the project; you might inadvertently have
the Storage Object Viewer permission for a different project.
Is your permission to access a certain bucket or object given through a
convenience value ? The removal of access granted to a convenience
value can cause previously enabled principals to lose access to resources.
For example, say jane@example.com has the Owner ( roles/owner )
basic role for a project named my-example-project , and the project's
IAM policy grants the Storage Object Creator
( roles/storage.objectCreator ) role to the convenience value
projectOwner:my-example-project . This means that jane@example.com has the
permissions associated with the Storage Object Creator role for buckets
within my-example-project . If this grant gets removed, jane@example.com
loses the permissions associated with the Storage Object Creator role.
In such a scenario, you can regain access to the bucket or object by granting
yourself the necessary bucket-level or object-level permissions required to
perform the actions you need.
Is there an IAM Deny policy that prevents you from using
certain permissions? You can contact your organization administrator to
find out whether an IAM Deny policy has been put in place.
403: Permission Denied
Issue : Permission denied error when you configure or manage the
Storage Intelligence configuration for a resource.
Solution : If you receive a permission denied error with a message similar to permission
storage.intelligenceConfigs.update when you configure and manage
Storage Intelligence for a resource, see the permission section for the
operation you want to perform. To resolve this issue,
grant the appropriate permissions. You can grant permissions in any of the following
ways:
Grant IAM permissions at the same
Google Cloud resource hierarchy resource that you are enabling
Storage Intelligence on.
Ensure that a resource higher in the Google Cloud resource hierarchy passes the permissions to the child resource.
409: Conflict
Issue : I tried to create a bucket but received the following error:
409 Conflict. Sorry, that name is not available. Please try a different one.
Solution : The bucket name you tried to use (e.g. gs://cats or gs://dogs )
is already taken. Cloud Storage has a global namespace so you may not
name a bucket with the same name as an existing bucket. Choose a name that is
not being used.
412: Custom constraints violated
Issue : My requests are being rejected with a 412 orgpolicy error.
Issue : My requests are being rejected with a
412 Multiple constraints were violated error.
Solution : Check with your security administrator team to see if the bucket
to which you're sending requests is being affected by an organization policy
that uses a custom constraint. Your bucket might also be affected by different
organization policies that conflict with one another. For example, where one
policy specifies that buckets must have the Standard storage class and another
policy specifies that buckets must have the Coldline storage class.
429: Too Many Requests
Issue : My requests are being rejected with a 429 Too Many Requests error.
Solution : You are hitting a limit to the number of requests
Cloud Storage allows for a given resource. See the
Cloud Storage quotas for a discussion of limits in
Cloud Storage.
If your workload consists of 1000's of requests per second to a bucket, see
Request rate and access distribution guidelines for a discussion of best
practices, including ramping up your workload gradually and avoiding
sequential filenames.
If your workload is potentially using 50 Gbps or more of network egress to
specific locations, check your bandwidth usage to ensure you're not
encountering a bandwidth quota.
Object context errors
This section describes common errors you might experience when working with
object contexts .
400: Object Context Limit Exceeded
Issue : The error indicates that the object has exceeded the limit of 50 contexts.
Solution : You have exceeded the limit for object
contexts per object. Reduce the number of context key-value pairs and try again.
400: Object Context Key Or Value Size Limit Exceeded
Issue : The error indicates that the size of an object context key or value
exceeds the limit of 256 bytes.
Solution : Each object context key and value must be 256 bytes or less (UTF-8
encoded). Shorten the key or value and try again.
400: Object Context Key Or Value Aggregate Size Limit Exceeded
Issue : The error indicates that the aggregate size of all object context
keys and values exceeds the limit.
Solution : The total size of all context keys and values for an
object must not exceed 25 KiB (25,600 bytes). Reduce the total amount of context
data and try again.
400: Object Context Key Or Value Forbidden Characters
Issue : The error indicates that the object context key or value contains
forbidden characters.
Solution : Object context keys and values can't contain single quotes ( ' ),
double quotes ( " ), backslashes ( \`), or forward slashes ( /`). Review your
contexts and remove any invalid characters.
400: Object Context Key Or Value Must Start With an Alphanumeric Character
Issue : The error indicates that the object context key or value doesn't
start with an alphanumeric character.
Solution : Object context keys and values must start with a letter or a
decimal digit.
400: Object Context Key Or Value Empty
Issue : The error indicates that an object context key or value can't be
empty.
Solution : Provide a non-empty string for both the key and the value of your
object contexts.
400: Object Context Key Or Value Invalid UTF-8
Issue : The error indicates that an object context key or value is not a
valid UTF-8 string.
Solution : Verify that all characters in your context keys and values are encoded using UTF-8.
400: Object Context Key Reserved Prefix
Issue : The error indicates that the object context key begins with a
reserved prefix.
Solution : Certain prefixes are reserved for system use. Avoid using
restricted prefixes, such as goog , in your context keys.
400: Object can't Have More Than 50 Drop Context Groups
Issue : The error indicates that the drop_context_groups parameter can't
have more than 50 values.
Solution : Reduce the number of values in the drop_context_groups parameter
and try again.
400: Invalid Value For Drop Context Groups Field
Issue : The error indicates that the drop_context_groups parameter contains
an invalid value.
Solution : The only accepted value for the drop_context_groups parameter is
custom .
Diagnosing Google Cloud console errors
Issue : When using the Google Cloud console to perform an
operation, I get a generic error message. For example, I see an error message
when trying to delete a bucket, but I don't see details for why the operation
failed.
Solution : Use the Google Cloud console's notifications to see detailed
information about the failed operation:
Click the Notifications button
( notifications )
in the Google Cloud console header.
A drop-down displays the most recent operations performed by the
Google Cloud console.
Click the item you want to find out more about.
A page opens up and displays detailed information about the operation.
Click each row to expand the detailed error information.
Issue : When using the Google Cloud console, I don't see a particular column
displayed.
Solution : To see a particular column displayed in the Google Cloud console,
click the Column display options icon
( view_column ) and select the column you want
displayed.
Simulated folders and managed folders
Issue : I deleted some objects in my bucket, and now the folder that
contained them doesn't appear in the Google Cloud console.
Solution : While the Google Cloud console displays your bucket's contents
as if there was a directory structure, folders don't fundamentally exist
in Cloud Storage. As a result, when you remove all objects with a
common prefix from a bucket, the folder icon representing that group of objects
no longer appears in the Google Cloud console.
Issue : I can't create managed folders.
Solution : To create managed folders , make sure the following
requirements are met:
You have an IAM role that contains the
storage.managedfolders.create permission, such as the Storage Object Admin
( roles/storage.objectAdmin ) role. For instructions on granting roles, see
Use IAM permissions .
Uniform bucket-level access is enabled on the bucket in which you want to
create managed folders.
There are no IAM Conditions on the bucket or the project that
use the bucket resource type ( storage.googleapis.com/Bucket ) or
the object resource type ( storage.googleapis.com/Object ). If any
bucket within a project has an IAM Condition that uses either
of these resource types, managed folders can't be created in any of the
buckets within that project, even if the condition is later removed.
Issue : I can't disable uniform bucket-level access because there are managed
folders in my bucket.
Solution : Uniform bucket-level access can't be disabled if there are
managed folders in the bucket. To disable uniform bucket-level access, you'll
need to first delete all managed folders in the bucket.
Static website errors
The following are common issues that you may encounter when
setting up a bucket to host a static website .
HTTPS serving
Issue : I want to serve my content over HTTPS without using a
load balancer .
Solution : You can serve static content through HTTPS using direct URIs
such as https://storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket/my-object . For other options
to serve your content through a custom domain over SSL, you can:
Use a third-party Content Delivery Network with Cloud Storage.
Serve your static website content from Firebase Hosting instead of
Cloud Storage.
Inaccessible page
Issue : I get an Access denied error message for a web page served by my
website.
Solution : Check that the object is shared publicly. If it is not, see
Making Data Public for instructions on how to do this.
If you previously uploaded and shared an object, but then upload a new version
of it, then you must reshare the object publicly. This is because the public
permission is replaced with the new upload.
Content download
Issue : I am prompted to download my page's content, instead of being able
to view it in my browser.
Solution : If you specify a MainPageSuffix as an object that doesn't have
a web content type, site visitors are prompted to download the content instead
of being able to see served page content. To resolve this issue, update the
Content-Type metadata entry to a suitable value, such as text/html .
For instructions, see Editing object metadata .
Make data public
Issue : I'm trying to make my data public but I get an organization
policy error.
Solution : Some organization policy constraints can prevent you from
making your data public. For example, the Domain Restricted Sharing constraint
( constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains ) restricts resource sharing based
on the organization's domain. For organization policy failures, contact your
administrator to grant you the project or bucket-level permissions to allow
resource sharing by editing the organization policy for the organization,
folder, or project resource . If you continue to see this error after
overriding the organization policy, then you might need to wait a few minutes
for the change to take effect.
Issue : I get a permission error when I attempt to make my data public .
Solution : Make sure that you have the storage.buckets.setIamPolicy
permission or the storage.objects.setIamPolicy permission. These permissions
are granted, for example, in the
Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin ) role . If you have the
storage.buckets.setIamPolicy permission or the storage.objects.setIamPolicy
permission and you still get an error, your bucket might be subject to
public access prevention , which doesn't allow access to allUsers or
allAuthenticatedUsers . Public access prevention might be set on the bucket
directly, or it might be enforced through an organization policy that is
set at a higher level.
Latency
The following are common latency issues you might encounter. In addition, the
Google Cloud Service Health Dashboard provides information about
incidents affecting Google Cloud services such as Cloud Storage.
Upload or download latency
Issue : I'm seeing increased latency when uploading or downloading.
Solution : Consider the following common causes of upload and download
latency:
CPU or memory constraints: The affected environment's operating system should
have tooling to measure local resource consumption such as CPU usage and
memory usage.
Disk IO constraints: The performance impact might be caused by local disk IO.
Geographical distance: Performance can be impacted by the physical separation
of your Cloud Storage bucket and affected environment, particularly
in cross-continental cases. Testing with a bucket located in the same region
as your affected environment can identify the extent to which geographic
separation is contributing to your latency.
If applicable, the affected environment's DNS resolver should use the
EDNS(0) protocol so that requests from the environment
are routed through an appropriate Google Front End.
CLI or client library latency
Issue : I'm seeing increased latency when accessing Cloud Storage
with the Google Cloud CLI or one of the client libraries .
Solution : The gcloud CLI and the client libraries
automatically retry requests when it's useful to do so, and this behavior
can effectively increase latency as seen from the end user. Use the
Cloud Monitoring metric storage.googleapis.com/api/request_count to
see if Cloud Storage is consistently serving a retryable response code,
such as 429 or 5xx .
Proxy servers
Issue : I'm connecting through a proxy server. What do I need to do?
Solution : To access Cloud Storage through a proxy server, you must
allow access to these domains:
accounts.google.com for creating OAuth2 authentication tokens
oauth2.googleapis.com for performing OAuth2 token exchanges
*.googleapis.com for storage requests
If your proxy server or security policy doesn't support allowlisting by domain
and instead only supports allowlisting by IP network block,
we strongly recommend that you configure your proxy server for all Google IP
address ranges. You can find the address ranges by querying WHOIS
data at ARIN . As a best practice, you should periodically
review your proxy settings to ensure they match Google's IP addresses.
We don't recommend configuring your proxy with individual IP addresses you
obtain from one-time lookups of oauth2.googleapis.com and
storage.googleapis.com . Because Google services are exposed using DNS names
that map to a large number of IP addresses that can change over time,
configuring your proxy based on a one-time lookup may lead to failures to
connect to Cloud Storage.
If your requests are being routed through a proxy server, you may need to
check with your network administrator to ensure that the Authorization
header containing your credentials is not stripped out by the proxy. Without
the Authorization header, your requests are rejected and you receive a
MissingSecurityHeader error.
