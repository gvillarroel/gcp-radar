Discover object storage with the Google Cloud CLI
This page shows you how to perform basic tasks in Cloud Storage using
the Google Cloud CLI.
Costs that you incur in Cloud Storage are based on the resources you
use. This quickstart typically uses less than $0.01 USD worth of
Cloud Storage resources.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/storage.admin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.

PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Note: If you are using Cloud Shell or a Compute Engine instance, the
Google Cloud SDK is pre-installed and authenticated. If your Compute Engine
instance is set up without a service account scope to Cloud Storage, run
gcloud init and follow the instructions.
Create a bucket
Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data in Cloud Storage.
To create a bucket:
Open a terminal window.
Use the gcloud storage buckets create command and a globally unique name to
create a bucket:
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME / --uniform-bucket-level-access
Replace BUCKET_NAME with a name for your bucket.
Caution: Don't include sensitive information in the bucket name, because
the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible.
See bucket naming requirements.
Bucket names can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, dashes ( - ),
underscores ( _ ), and dots ( . ). Spaces are not allowed.
Names containing dots require verification .
Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
Bucket names must contain 3-63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to
222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.
Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation
(for example, 192.168.5.4).
Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix.
Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings, such as "g00gle".
If successful, the command returns a response like the following:
Creating gs://my-awesome-bucket/...
If the bucket name that you chose is already in use, either by
you or someone else, the command returns a response like
ServiceException: 409 Bucket my-awesome-bucket already exists. Try again
with a different bucket name.
You've just created a bucket where you can store your data!
Upload an object into your bucket
Save the following image to your computer, such as on the desktop.
Note: If you are using Cloud Shell or a Compute Engine instance,
download the image using the following command:
wget https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/images/kitten.png
Use the gcloud storage cp command to copy the image from the location
where you saved it to the bucket that you created:
gcloud storage cp Desktop/kitten.png gs:// BUCKET_NAME
Tip: When typing your bucket name, you can use the tab key to autocomplete it.
If successful, the command returns a response like the following:
Copying file://Desktop/kitten.png to gs://my-awesome-bucket/kitten.png
Completed files 1/1 | 8.6kiB/8.6kiB
You've just stored an object in your bucket.
Download the object from your bucket
Use the gcloud storage cp command to download the image that you stored
in your bucket to somewhere on your computer, such as the desktop:
gcloud storage cp gs:// BUCKET_NAME /kitten.png Desktop/kitten2.png
If successful, the command returns a response like the following:
Copying gs://my-awesome-bucket/kitten.png to file://Desktop/kitten2.png
Completed files 1/1 | 8.6kiB/8.6kiB
You've just downloaded something from your bucket.
Copy the object to a simulated folder in the bucket
Use the gcloud storage cp command to create a simulated folder and copy the
image into it:
gcloud storage cp gs:// BUCKET_NAME /kitten.png gs:// BUCKET_NAME /quickstart-folder/kitten3.png
Note: Simulated folders in Cloud Storage have limitations compared
to local file systems or folders in buckets that have hierarchical namespace
enabled, but many of the same operations are supported.
If successful, the command returns a response like the following:
Copying gs://my-awesome-bucket/kitten.png to gs://my-awesome-bucket/quickstart-folder/kitten3.png
Completed files 1/1 | 8.6kiB/8.6kiB
You've just copied your image into a new simulated folder in your bucket.
List contents of a bucket
Use the gcloud storage ls command to list the contents at the top
level of your bucket:
gcloud storage ls gs:// BUCKET_NAME
If successful, the command returns a response like the following:
gs://my-awesome-bucket/kitten.png
gs://my-awesome-bucket/quickstart-folder/
You've just seen the contents at the top level of your bucket.
List details for an object
Use the gcloud storage ls command with the --long flag to get some
details about one of your images:
gcloud storage ls gs:// BUCKET_NAME /kitten.png --long
If successful, the command returns a response like the following:
8775 2026-01-21T01:22:17Z gs://srs-bucketcli/kitten.png
TOTAL: 1 objects, 8775 bytes (8.57kiB)
You've just obtained information about the image's size and date of
creation.
Make the objects publicly accessible
Use the gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding command to grant all
users permission to read the images stored in your bucket:
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// BUCKET_NAME --member=allUsers --role=roles/storage.objectViewer
The command is successful if your response contains the following:
bindings:
- members:
- allUsers
role: roles/storage.objectViewer
Now anyone can get your images.
To remove this access, use the following command:
gcloud storage buckets remove-iam-policy-binding gs:// BUCKET_NAME --member=allUsers --role=roles/storage.objectViewer
The command is successful if no error is returned.
You have removed public access to the images in your bucket.
Note: After you remove public access, you may still be able to access a cached
version of your images for a period of time.
Give someone access to your bucket
Use the gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding command to give a
specific email address permission to add objects to your bucket:
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// BUCKET_NAME --member=user:jeffersonloveshiking@gmail.com --role=roles/storage.objectCreator
The command is successful if your response contains the following:
bindings:
- members:
- user:jeffersonloveshiking@gmail.com
role: roles/storage.objectCreator
Now this user can add items to your bucket.
To remove this permission, use the following command:
gcloud storage buckets remove-iam-policy-binding gs:// BUCKET_NAME --member=user:jeffersonloveshiking@gmail.com --role=roles/storage.objectCreator
The command is successful if no error is returned.
You have removed the user's access to this bucket.
Delete an object
Use the gcloud storage rm command to delete one of your images:
gcloud storage rm gs:// BUCKET_NAME /kitten.png
If successful, the command returns a response like the following:
Removing gs://my-awesome-bucket/kitten.png...
This copy of the image is no longer stored on Cloud Storage
(though the copy you made in the simulated folder quickstart-folder/ still
exists).
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, delete the Google Cloud project with the
resources.
Use the gcloud storage rm command with the --recursive flag to
delete the bucket and anything inside of it:
gcloud storage rm gs:// BUCKET_NAME --recursive
If successful, the command returns a response like the following:
Removing objects:
Removing gs://my-awesome-bucket/quickstart-folder/kitten3.png#1768960201129254
Completed 1/1
Removing buckets:
Removing gs://my-awesome-bucket/...
Completed 1/1
Your bucket and its contents are deleted.
