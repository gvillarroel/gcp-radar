XML API overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document gives an overview of the Cloud Storage XML API and is intended for
software developers. It assumes that you are familiar with RESTful services and
web programming and that you are comfortable creating applications that operate
through HTTP requests. If this does not describe you, consider one of the
following alternatives:
If you are just starting out with Cloud Storage, you should first try
either the Google Cloud console Quickstart or the
Google Cloud CLI Quickstart . These tutorials demonstrate the basics of
using Cloud Storage without the need to use the API directly.
If you work in certain programming languages, you can use
the Cloud Storage Client Libraries .
If you are a mobile or web app developer, you can use the Firebase SDKs
for Cloud Storage.
If you are not a software developer and want to store your personal data in
the cloud and share it with others, you can use Google Drive .
Overview
The Cloud Storage XML API is a RESTful interface that lets you manage
Cloud Storage data in a programmatic way. As a RESTful API, it relies on
method information and scoping information to define the operations to
perform:
Method information
You specify the method information with standard HTTP methods, such as
DELETE , GET , HEAD , POST , and PUT .
Scoping information
You specify the scoping information with a publicly-accessible endpoint
(URI) and various scoping parameters. For the XML API, the primary scoping
parameters are the bucket and object names. You can further scope
your operations by using HTTP headers and query string parameters .
You use HTTP methods to perform operations on the resource you specify in the
scope. For a list of operations available in the XML API, see
XML API Request Methods . Key capabilities include:
Standard object operations such as PUT , GET , HEAD , POST , and DELETE .
Bucket management.
Access Control List (ACL) management.
Access to Cloud Storage through the XML API is useful when you are using
tools and libraries that must work across different storage providers, or
when you are migrating from another storage provider to Cloud Storage. In the
latter case, you only need to make a few simple changes to your existing tools
and libraries to begin sending requests to Cloud Storage. For more
information about migrating to Cloud Storage, see
Simple migration from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage .
Requests
Note: We recommend that you use HTTPS when reading or writing data to
Cloud Storage so that your data is encrypted during transfer.
Cloud Storage automatically encrypts your data before it is written to
disk. For more information, see Encryption .
The Cloud Storage XML API provides a web interface for making HTTP
requests and handling HTTP responses. The API is compatible with HTTP/1.1,
HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 protocols. Each request implements a standard HTTP method.
Along with these methods, you can use various HTTP request headers.
Authentication
All requests to Cloud Storage must be authenticated, with the exception
of requests made to anonymously accessible objects or buckets. Requests are
typically authenticated using the Authorization header .
Endpoints
Important: If you intend to serve content through a browser, note that the XML
API serves content from the same origin as the request endpoint. If you need to
serve content from a unique origin, consider using the JSON API or
Authenticated browser downloads .
Most Cloud Storage XML API requests use the following URI for accessing
buckets and objects:
storage.googleapis.com
You can scope this further by adding a bucket and object to the URI. The
resulting URL can take two forms:
BUCKET_NAME .storage.googleapis.com/ OBJECT_NAME
storage.googleapis.com/ BUCKET_NAME / OBJECT_NAME
You can use the Cloud Storage URI with unsecured requests (HTTP) and secured
requests (HTTPS) that use secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption.
For additional endpoints, such as dedicated upload and download endpoints
for the XML API, see Request Endpoints .
Headers and query string parameters
The Cloud Storage XML API supports HTTP request headers. It also
supports several extension (custom) request headers, which have an x-goog-
prefix. Request header requirements vary depending on the kind of request you're
making. Some frequently used request headers include:
Request Header
Description
Usage
Authorization
The authentication string for requests.
Required for all authenticated requests.
Content-Length
The size of the request body (excluding headers) in bytes.
Required for all PUT and POST requests, except chunked transfers.
Content-Type
The MIME type of the request body, such as application/xml or text/html .
Recommended for requests that contain an entity body.
Date
The date and time of the request.
Required for all requests, except for signed URLs , which can use x-goog-date instead.
Host
The URI for the request.
Required for all requests.
x-goog-project-id
The ID of the project you want to use.
Required for creating buckets or listing buckets except when you are using the XML API for interoperability, such as for compatibility with Amazon S3. For more information, see Simple migration from Amazon S3 to Cloud Storage .
The Cloud Storage XML API also supports a variety of query string parameters,
which you can use to scope your requests. Append query string parameters to the
HTTP path portion of the request with the following syntax:
PATH_TO_OBJECT /? PARAMETER = VALUE & PARAMETER = VALUE ...
For a complete list of XML API headers and query string parameters, see
HTTP headers and query string parameters .
Example request
A typical authenticated Cloud Storage request is shown in the following
example. This request retrieves a list of objects that are stored in a
bucket named travel-maps . The request limits the list of objects to only those
objects that have the prefix /europe/france .
GET /?list-type=2&prefix=/europe/france/ HTTP/1.1
Host: travel-maps.storage.googleapis.com
Date: Wed, 17 Feb 2010 15:31:56 -0800
Content-Length: 0
Authorization: Bearer ya29.AHES6ZRVmB7fkLtd1XTmq6mo0S1wqZZi3-Lh_s-6Uw7p8vtgSwg
Responses
The Cloud Storage XML API returns standard HTTP response headers and
several extension (custom) response headers. The response headers vary according
to the operation you perform. Some frequently used response headers include:
Response Header
Description
Cache-Control
The cache control setting for the response.
Content-Length
The size of the response body (excluding headers) in bytes.
Content-Type
The MIME type of the response body, such as application/xml or text/html .
Date
The date and time of the response.
ETag
An HTTP 1.1 entity tag , which you can use to determine whether an object has changed.
Responses can also include a status code. Cloud Storage uses standard
HTTP status codes. An error response includes an XML document in the
response body, which contains information about the error conditions. For a
list of status codes used by the XML API, see HTTP Status and Error Codes .
A typical Cloud Storage response is shown in the following example. This
example is a response to a request for listing a bucket's contents . The
bucket name is travel-maps and the request is scoped so that only objects
with the prefix /europe/france/ are returned in the list.
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 4061
Content-Type: application/xml
Date: Wed, 17 Feb 2010 23:31:57 GMT
