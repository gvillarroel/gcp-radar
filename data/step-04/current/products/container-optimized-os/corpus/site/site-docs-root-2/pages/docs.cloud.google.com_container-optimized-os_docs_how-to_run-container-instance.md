Running containers on instances
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can run a Docker container on a machine running Container-Optimized OS in
much the same way as you would on most other node image distributions, by using
the docker run command. For example:
docker run --rm busybox echo "hello world"
The following output appears:
Unable to find image 'busybox:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/busybox
. . .
Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest
hello world
When managing SSH keys in metadata, all user accounts managed by Compute Engine
on the cos image are added to the docker group by default. This lets any
logged-in user run docker commands without root privileges. When managing SSH
keys using OS Login, the user account needs to be added to the docker group
manually. Or else, the user has to add sudo for each docker command.
Accessing public images in Container Registry or Artifact Registry
Container Registry support is built in to the cos node image. To
start a container from Container Registry, run:
docker run --rm gcr.io/google-containers/busybox echo "hello world"
The following output appears:
Unable to find image 'gcr.io/google-containers/busybox:latest' locally
Pulling repository gcr.io/google-containers/busybox
. . .
Status: Downloaded newer image for gcr.io/google-containers/busybox:latest
hello world
Accessing private images in Artifact Registry or Container Registry
Starting with milestone 60 releases,
docker-credential-gcr
is pre-installed in Container-Optimized OS images. It's the recommended
way to access private images in Artifact Registry or Container Registry.
To use docker-credential-gcr , run the following command:
Artifact Registry
docker-credential-gcr configure-docker --registries LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev
Replace LOCATION with the
location of your
repository.
Container Registry
docker-credential-gcr configure-docker
The following output appears:
/home/username/.docker/config.json configured to use this credential helper
To run an image from the registry, use the following command:
Artifact Registry
docker run --rm LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ your-project / repository / your-image
Replace LOCATION with the
location of your
repository.
Container Registry
docker run --rm gcr.io/ your-project / your-image
You can use the following Container Registry hostnames:
us.gcr.io
eu.gcr.io
asia.gcr.io
To use docker with sudo , run the following command. The -E command-line
flag makes docker use the .docker/config.json file from a user's home
directory instead of the root home directory.
Artifact Registry
sudo -E docker run --rm LOCATION -docker.pkg.dev/ your-project / repository / your-image
Replace LOCATION with the
location of your
repository.
Container Registry
sudo -E docker run --rm gcr.io/ your-project / your-image
Supported Container Registry hostnames are:
us.gcr.io
eu.gcr.io
asia.gcr.io
Alternately, you can fetch appropriate OAuth access tokens from Compute Engine
metadata and use them with the docker login command manually, as shown in the
following example:
METADATA = http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1
SVC_ACCT = $METADATA /instance/service-accounts/default
ACCESS_TOKEN = $( curl -H 'Metadata-Flavor: Google' $SVC_ACCT /token | cut -d '"' -f 4 )
docker login -u oauth2accesstoken -p $ACCESS_TOKEN https://gcr.io
docker run … gcr.io/ your-project / your-image
Using cloud-init with Container Registry
This cloud-init example
uses the Cloud Config format to start a Docker container from an image
stored in Docker's container registry called DockerHub .
The example below uses the Cloud Config format to start a Docker container from
an image stored in Container Registry:
#cloud-config
write_files :
- path : /etc/systemd/system/cloudservice.service
permissions : 0644
owner : root
content : |
[Unit]
Description=Start a simple docker container
Wants=gcr-online.target
After=gcr-online.target
[Service]
Environment="HOME=/home/cloudservice"
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/docker-credential-gcr configure-docker
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm --name=mycloudservice gcr.io/google-containers/busybox:latest /bin/sleep 3600
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop mycloudservice
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/docker rm mycloudservice
runcmd :
- systemctl daemon-reload
- systemctl start cloudservice.service
Note: docker-credential-gcr writes credentials to $HOME/.docker/config.json .
When running /usr/bin/docker-credential-gcr configure-docker in a unit file,
you must set the environment variable $HOME , similar to the example above.
Otherwise, docker-credential-gcr will try to write credentials to
/root/.docker/config.json , which is not permitted on Container-Optimized OS.
Configuring Docker daemon to pull images from registry cache
You can configure Docker daemon to pull images from a registry cache by using
registry mirrors.
Configure the daemon to use the registry-mirror option in one of the
following ways:
In the /etc/default/docker file, add the registry-mirror option for
the registry (for example, https://mirror.gcr.io ):
echo 'DOCKER_OPTS="--registry-mirror=https://mirror.gcr.io"' | tee /etc/default/docker
In the /etc/default/docker file, append "--registry-mirror=https://mirror.gcr.io"
to the existing DOCKER_OPTS :
sed -i -e 's|"$| --registry-mirror=https://mirror.gcr.io"|' /etc/default/docker
After adding the registry mirror, restart the Docker daemon for the changes
to take effect:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
Adding a configuration to /etc/default/docker is non-persistent across reboot.
To ensure that your docker configuration remains persistent across reboots,
consider adding the commands either in the cloud-init script of the instance's
metadata in the cloud-config format
or startup script .
The following example uses the cloud-config format to configure a
registry-mirror :
#cloud-config
runcmd :
- echo 'DOCKER_OPTS="--registry-mirror=https://mirror.gcr.io"' | tee /etc/default/docker
- systemctl daemon-reload
- systemctl restart docker
Note: For recommendations on handling DockerHub pull request limits in
instances running as part of a GKE cluster, see the
Preparing Google Cloud deployments for Docker Hub pull request limits
blog post.

Troubleshooting
Resolving option conflicts between Docker daemon.json and flags
When configuring the Docker daemon, if the same option is set with a
daemon.json file and with flags, Docker will fail to start with an error
similar to:
unable to configure the Docker daemon with file /etc/docker/daemon.json:
the following directives are specified both as a flag and in the configuration file:
The recommended solution to resolve this conflict is to modify the default
daemon.json , which is located at /etc/docker/daemon.json . Modifying this
file allows for changing only the affected options, while maintaining the other
default options. This can be done using cloud-init , for example using a
cloud-config similar to:
#cloud-config
write_files:
- path: /tmp/modify_docker_daemon_opts.py
permissions: 0744
owner: root
content: |
import json, sys, os, logging
DAEMON_OPTS_FILE = '/etc/docker/daemon.json'
opts = {}
if os.path.exists(DAEMON_OPTS_FILE):
with open(DAEMON_OPTS_FILE) as f:
try:
opts = json.load(f)
except:
logging.info("json parsing failed, starting with empty config.")
pass
# Add your daemon option modifications here
# For example,
# opts['log-opts']['max-size'] = '100m'
with open(DAEMON_OPTS_FILE, 'w') as f:
json.dump(opts, f)
runcmd:
- python /tmp/modify_docker_daemon_opts.py
- rm -f /tmp/modify_docker_daemon_opts.py
- systemctl restart docker.service
