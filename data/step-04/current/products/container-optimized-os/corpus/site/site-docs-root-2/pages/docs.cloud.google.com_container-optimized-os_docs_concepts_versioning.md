Milestones and Build Numbers
Major versions of Container-Optimized OS images are identified using
what we call milestones . Container-Optimized OS milestones are
monotonically increasing integers. Each new milestone indicates the start of a new
development cycle (a branch in our code) and may introduce new features and other
major changes.
Over the lifetime of a Container-Optimized OS milestone, we may release
several updates containing bug fixes, security fixes and other changes. These
incremental releases on a milestone can be identified using the build number .
The milestone and build number of the Container-Optimized OS you are using
can be identified by inspecting the /etc/os-release file. In this file, the
value of the VERSION_ID (for example, VERSION_ID=81 ) represents the milestone
and the value of the BUILD_ID field (for example, BUILD_ID=12871.1160.0 )
represents the build number. The milestone and build number are also present as
part of the Container-Optimized OS image name. For example, image
cos-81-12871-1160-0 has milestone 81 and build number 12871-1160-0 .
Long Term Supported (LTS) milestones
Milestones that are intended for production use and supported for longer duration
are labelled as LTS (for Long Term Supported). On Compute Engine, we use the
image families feature to label and identify
our LTS releases.
The following table provides a summary of Container-Optimized OS releases available on
Compute Engine:

Development Release Notes
For release notes related to the milestone under development, see the
Development Release Notes page.
For release notes related to cos-dev before M93, see the
Legacy Release Notes
page.
There may be multiple active LTS milestones at any time. For example, the
following command shows currently active LTS image families:
gcloud compute images list --no-standard-images --project=cos-cloud | grep lts
cos-101-17162-40-16 cos-cloud cos-101-lts READY
cos-89-16108-766-3 cos-cloud cos-89-lts READY
cos-93-16623-295-5 cos-cloud cos-93-lts READY
cos-97-16919-189-3 cos-cloud cos-97-lts READY
cos-arm64-101-17162-40-16 cos-cloud cos-arm64-101-lts READY
Lifecycle of an LTS milestone
A new Container-Optimized OS LTS milestone is introduced approximately
every 6 months on its own image family named cos-[MILESTONE]-lts (x86) and
cos-arm64-[MILESTONE]-lts (Arm).
Before being labeled as LTS, the milestone undergoes approximately 6 months of
feature development and 2 months of extensive testing and stabilization.
The lifecycle of a Container-Optimized OS LTS milestone looks as follows:
Stage
Duration
Description
Development
6 months
Active development during which the milestone receives major package upgrades, new features.
Released monthly or as needed on cos-dev and cos-arm64-dev families.
Stabilization
2 months
Features are frozen and the focus is on expanded testing, bug fixing and stabilizing the
release. Released as needed on cos-beta and cos-arm64-beta families.
Production
2 years
Active maintenance of milestone by addressing production issues and security fixes with
priority. Released as needed on cos-[MILESTONE]-lts and
cos-arm64-[MILESTONE]-lts families.
Deprecation
N/A
All images on the milestone are marked deprecated and the cos-[MILESTONE]-lts
and cos-arm64-[MILESTONE]-lts are removed. Users may still refer to the
deprecated images, but will not receive any bug fixes or security updates.
Once promoted to the LTS family, the LTS milestone provides the following benefits:
A support duration of 2 years
Security fixes for the entire support duration
Fixes for any production issues
A dedicated release notes
page listing every change going into the image.
For all of your production deployments, we recommend that you use an image
from one of the LTS families.
After the LTS support duration is over for a LTS milestone, the corresponding
image family will no longer receive any security or bug fixes. In addition, the
corresponding cos-[MILESTONE]-lts and cos-arm64-[MILESTONE]-lts image
families will be marked as deprecated.
Warning: Any image family API
references to the deprecated image family will return errors and break any workflows
depending on it. You should not use this API to create production instances.
Please refer to the
Support Policy to
learn more about support commitments for these families.
LTS Refresh releases
On-demand releases are made on LTS milestones in response to high priority bug
and security fixes. Every three months, a release is made that includes medium and
low priority bug and security fixes. We call these releases "LTS Refresh"
releases. These releases are made less frequently to help users manage update
risks.
The release notes page for the milestone will indicate which releases are
LTS Refresh releases. Users should take extra care when rolling out these
releases, because medium and low priority bug and security fixes might introduce
regressions.
Choosing the right Container-Optimized OS version
On Compute Engine, the image families for Container-Optimized OS can
guide you in selecting the correct image for your intended purpose. We strongly
recommend that you set up tiered testing alongside your production environment
utilizing the convenience offered by the image family api.
Warning: We recommend using the
Image Family API only for
testing to automatically pick the latest images released on the image families.
We do not recommend using it for creating production instances. You should always
refer to a specific image you have qualified for use in production. This prevents
any potential disruption due to the image being updated and rolled out to your
production environment without being qualified first.
x86 image family
Arm image family
Description
Suggested use
cos-[MILESTONE]-lts
cos-arm64-[MILESTONE]-lts
This family follows releases for a particular production-ready milestone.
Images on this family receive only security and stability fixes.
Suitable for running all production workloads. Start with the highest
milestone to maximize support duration.
cos-stable
cos-arm64-stable
This family follows our latest production-ready milestone.
Images on this family receive all security and stability fixes. Every 6 months,
the latest LTS milestone containing new features is also released on this
family.
Create one-off instances that you plan to configure and maintain manually.
cos-beta
cos-arm64-beta
This family follows our next major release in stabilization phase.
Use for continuous testing to validate new features and OS upgrades.
cos-dev
cos-arm64-dev
This family follows our latest in-development release. Images on this
family receive major changes and potentially unstable features.
Use for experimentation and one-off testing.
A tiered testing setup like this should help to minimize issues when rolling
out newer major versions of Container-Optimized OS images to your
production environment.
