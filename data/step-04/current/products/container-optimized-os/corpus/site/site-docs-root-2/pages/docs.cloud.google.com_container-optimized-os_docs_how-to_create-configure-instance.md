Creating and configuring instances
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
There are two ways to create and configure Compute Engine instances running
Container-Optimized OS from Google.
For simple scenarios where you want to run a single container on a VM or on each
VM in a
managed instance group ,
you can specify a container image and optional
configuration parameters when you define the instance or instance template.
Compute Engine creates the instance with the latest version of
Container-Optimized OS and launches the specified container when the VM
starts.
Caution: The container startup agent that deploys containers on VMs during VM creation is deprecated.
Use the docker run commands in a startup script or use the cloud-init tool
to configure and to run containers on your VMs and MIGs. For more information,
see Migrate containers that were deployed on VMs during VM creation .
For advanced scenarios where you can deploy multiple containers and configure
Docker options using cloud-init , you can create a Compute Engine instance with
your choice of Container-Optimized OS image, and then proceed to configure the container as
needed.
Creating a simple instance
Use this method to deploy a single container on a VM using the latest version of
Container-Optimized OS. You can perform this task using the Google Cloud console
or gcloud CLI.
Console
Note: The Deploy container option in the Google Cloud console is deprecated.
Use the equivalent docker run command to configure and to run the container.
Go to the VM instances page.
Go to the VM instances page
Click Create instance .
Specify a Name for your instance.
In the Container section, select the Deploy a container image to
this VM instance checkbox.
Specify the Container image to use.
You can specify an image from Container Registry or Artifact Registry.
For example:
gcr.io/cloud-marketplace/google/nginx1:1.15 selects an NGINX 1.15 container image from Google Cloud Marketplace.
us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
selects a sample hello-app image from Artifact Registry.
If you use a container image from Docker Hub, always specify the
full Docker image name. For example, specify the following image name
to deploy an Apache container image: docker.io/httpd:2.4 .
Optionally, click Advanced container options . For more information,
see Configuring Options to Run Your Container .
Click Create to create the instance, boot the instance,
and launch the container.
gcloud
Note: The create-with-container gcloud CLI command is deprecated.
Use the equivalent docker run command to configure and to run the container.
To create a basic VM instance, run the following command:
gcloud compute instances create-with-container instance-name \
--container-image image-name
Replace the following:
instance-name : the name for the new instance.
image-name : the name of the container image.
For example, the following command creates a new VM instance named
nginx-vm , which will launch and run the gcr.io/cloud-marketplace/google/nginx1:1.15
container image:
gcloud compute instances create-with-container nginx-vm \
--container-image gcr.io/cloud-marketplace/google/nginx1:1.15
Similarly, you can create a new VM instance named hello-app which
will launch and run a sample container in Artifact Registry:
gcloud compute instances create-with-container hello-app \
--container-image us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
When using a container image from Docker Hub, you must always specify a full
Docker image name. For example, specify the following image name to deploy
an Apache container image:
docker.io/httpd:2.4
To run a single container on each VM in a managed instance group, specify the
container image name when defining the instance template. See
Creating an instance template with a container image
for more information.
Creating an instance for advanced scenarios
Use this method to select a specific Container-Optimized OS image, to deploy
multiple containers, and to use cloud-init for advanced configuration.
Viewing available images
Container-Optimized OS images are available on Google Cloud console's
list of images with the prefix cos .
These are hosted under the cos-cloud project. You can also see all
currently available releases on command line by running the following command:
gcloud compute images list --project cos-cloud --no-standard-images
The output is similar to the following:
NAME PROJECT FAMILY DEPRECATED STATUS
cos-69-10895-385-0 cos-cloud cos-69-lts READY
cos-73-11647-534-0 cos-cloud cos-73-lts READY
cos-77-12371-251-0 cos-cloud cos-77-lts READY
cos-81-12871-103-0 cos-cloud cos-81-lts READY
cos-beta-81-12871-44-0 cos-cloud cos-beta READY
cos-dev-84-13078-0-0 cos-cloud cos-dev READY
cos-stable-81-12871-103-0 cos-cloud cos-stable READY
Note: The most current Container-Optimized OS images are now available under
the project cos-cloud , and use the name prefix of cos . These
images are identical to the previous versions of Container-Optimized OS, which
used the name prefix gci and were accessible through the google-containers
project. The gci images in the google-containers project are considered
deprecated . Newer versions of Container-Optimized OS images are now
being pushed only to the cos-cloud project; please update your
development or production workflow to use the cos images in cos-cloud to get the latest releases.
Creating an instance
You can create an instance using the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI, or
the API.
Console
Note: The Deploy container option in the Google Cloud console is deprecated.
Use the equivalent docker run command to configure and to run the container.
To run a Compute Engine instance with a Container-Optimized OS and Docker
installed, do the following:
Open the Compute Engine instance creation page on Google Cloud console.
Create a new Compute Engine instance
Specify a Name for your instance.
In the Containers section, clear the
Deploy a container image to this VM instance checkbox. This option is
useful if you want to
deploy a single container on the VM.
In the Boot disk section, select a Container-Optimized OS image.
Click Create to create and boot the instance.
gcloud
Note: The create-with-container gcloud CLI command is deprecated.
Use the equivalent docker run command to configure and to run the container.
Review the available images , then use
the following command to create a cos node image instance:
gcloud compute instances create instance-name \
--image image-name \
--image-project cos-cloud \
--zone compute-zone \
--machine-type machine-type-name
Replace the following:
instance-name : the name of your VM instance.
image-name : the name of the Container-Optimized OS image for
the instance, obtained from the list of available images .
From our previous example, we can use cos-beta-81-12871-44-0 .
compute-zone : the compute zone
for your instance.
machine-type-name : the machine type to use for this new instance.
The default type is n1-standard-1 .
For example, the following command creates an instanced named cos-test
using the cos-beta-67-10575-13-0 image:
gcloud compute instances create cos-test \
--image cos-beta-67-10575-13-0 \
--image-project cos-cloud \
--zone us-east1-d \
--machine-type n1-standard-1
You can add the --preemptible flag for one-off, experimental instances.
API
In the API, construct a normal request to
create an instance ,
but include a Container-Optimized OS source image .
For example:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ project-id /zones/ compute-zone /instances
{
'machineType': 'zones/ compute-zone /machineTypes/ machine-type-name ',
'name': ' instance-name ',
'networkInterfaces': [
{
'accessConfigs': [
{
'type': 'ONE_TO_ONE_NAT',
'name': 'External NAT'
}
],
'network': 'global/networks/default'
}
],
'disks': [
{
'type': 'PERSISTENT',
'boot': true,
'autoDelete': true,
'initializeParams': {
'sourceImage': 'projects/cos-cloud/global/images/ image-name '
}
}
]
}
Configuring an instance
In some cases, you might want to do additional configuration when the instance
boots. You can use the cloud-init tool with Container-Optimized OS to apply
configuration information that you supply in a cloud-config format .
Using cloud-init with the Cloud config format
Container-Optimized OS images include
cloud-init
as a way to configure your instance when it boots up. The cloud-init tool
expects its configuration in the value of the user-data key of the
instance metadata . The cloud-init
tool understands multiple formats .
Here's an example cloud-init file showing how to create a user account and
create a systemd service owned by this user that controls the management of a
Docker busybox container:
#cloud-config
users :
- name : cloudservice
uid : 2000
write_files :
- path : /etc/systemd/system/cloudservice.service
permissions : 0644
owner : root
content : |
[Unit]
Description=Start a simple docker container
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -u 2000 --name=mycloudservice busybox:latest /bin/sleep 3600
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop mycloudservice
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/docker rm mycloudservice
runcmd :
- systemctl daemon-reload
- systemctl start cloudservice.service
# Optional once-per-boot setup. For example: mounting a PD.
bootcmd :
- fsck.ext4 -tvy /dev/[DEVICE_ID]
- mkdir -p /mnt/disks/[MNT_DIR]
- mount -t ext4 -O ... /dev/[DEVICE_ID] /mnt/disks/[MNT_DIR]
Note: Using systemctl enable in the runcmd section of cloud-init will not
work as intended. This is because /etc on Container-Optimized OS is stateless,
so commands such as systemctl enable/disable , that modify /etc,
won't persist across reboots. See Disks and Filesystem
for more information on Container-Optimized OS's filesystem. An alternative
to systemctl enable is to use systemctl start , as in the example above.
cloud-init modules such as write_files and runcmd , which are typically
run once-per-instance on other distros, are run on every boot on Container-Optimized OS. Note: The uid option in the users section is a cos node image
extension. This option will not work with other versions of cloud-init. This
option explicitly sets the ID for the user and allows you to make sure
the ID is consistent between different instances. It's recommended
that you always set this option. Choose an ID from the [2000, 4999]
range to avoid collision with other user accounts.
To create a Container-Optimized OS VM instance that references this
cloud-init file, use the --metadata-from-file command line flag.
Assuming the cloud-init file is called filename in the current
directory, the following command creates a Container-Optimized OS instance and
trigger cloud-init by assigning the contents of the file to the user-data
key in the Instance Metadata:
gcloud compute instances create instance-name \
--image image-name \
--image-project cos-cloud \
--metadata-from-file user-data= filename
Replace the following:
instance-name : the name of your VM instance.
image-name : the name of the Container-Optimized OS image for
the instance. For example, --image=cos-113-18244-85-29 .
filename : the name of the metadata file.
It is possible to set other metadata flags when creating Container-Optimized OS
instances. Because these properties are simple key-value pairs, you may use the
--metadata flag in the gcloud compute instances create command to create the
properties. Also, starting from milestone 97 ,
you can set metadata flags in project
metadata using the --metadata flag
in the gcloud compute project-info add-metadata command. Flags
defined at the instance level will take precedence over flags defined at the
project level.
The previous example can be expanded to collect usage statistics and
crash dump collection with the following command:
gcloud compute instances create instance-name \
--image image-name \
--image-project cos-cloud \
--metadata-from-file user-data= filename \
--metadata=cos-metrics-enabled=true
Other metadata flags
Metadata Key
Description
Default Behavior
cos-update-strategy
Specifies automatic update behavior. Value could be update_enabled , update_disabled , or unset. If unset, the default auto-update behavior for the milestone will be used. If enabled, the behavior depends on the release channel: cos-dev and cos-beta: Updates from latest OS version in the corresponding image family
LTS milestone and cos-stable: Updates from latest OS version from the same milestone
Milestones < 117: Enabled by default
Milestones >= 117: Disabled by default
cos-metrics-enabled
Enables crash dump collection. Values could be: true false (default).
Disabled by default
Caution: Enabling the cos-metrics-enabled setting permits collection of some
crash reports that help Google improve the cos node
image. Crash reports
contain a snippet of the most recent portion of the kernel log buffer
at the time of the crash, and may contain user or
personal information, depending on what was happening at the time of the crash.
The information is sent to Google directly and is not shared outside of Google.
Connecting to an instance
You can SSH into your VM instance running the cos node image the same way
you SSH into other Compute Engine instances.
For example:
gcloud compute ssh instance-name \
--project project-id \
--zone compute-zone
Running startup scripts
You can specify a startup script through the
metadata server, using the startup-script metadata key. You can use the
Google Cloud CLI, the API, or Google Cloud console to provide a
startup script. Refer to Running Startup Scripts
for details.
Time synchronization
Before milestone 85 , Container-Optimized OS uses systemd 's systemd-timesyncd service to synchronize
the local system clock with a remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server via the
SNTP protocol. The following entries in /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
configuration file show commented out default configuration values to help the
administrator make any desired changes:
cat /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
# comments omitted for brevity
[Time]
#NTP=
#FallbackNTP=metadata.google.internal
#RootDistanceMaxSec=5
#PollIntervalMinSec=32
#PollIntervalMaxSec=2048
So the maximum acceptable root distance is 5 seconds and the minimum and
maximum poll intervals for NTP messages are 32 and 2048 seconds respectively.
Starting from milestone 85, Container-Optimized OS uses chronyd service to synchronize
the local system clock with a remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server via the
NTP protocol. The following entries in the /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
configuration file show commented out default configuration values to help the
administrator make any desired changes:
cat /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
# Use custom NTP servers
server metadata.google.internal prefer iburst
# Record the rate at which the system clock gains/losses time.
driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
# Allow the system clock to be stepped in the first three updates
# if its offset is larger than 1 second.
makestep 1.0 3
# Enable kernel synchronization of the real-time clock (RTC).
rtcsync
The NTP server is set from eth0 's DHCP response, which is usually the
Compute Engine's metadata server:
networkctl status eth0 | grep NTP
NTP: 169.254.169.254
Changing the time zone
The default time zone of Container-Optimized OS from Google is UTC0. Create a symbolic link
to your desired time zone as in the following example:
sudo rm /etc/localtime
sudo ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific /etc/localtime
Note that /etc is stateless, so the time zone will be reset to the default
(UTC0) every reboot.
Enabling or disabling automatic updates
There are two ways to enable or disable automatic updates. The preferred method
is to set the cos-update-strategy instance metadata key to update_enabled or
update_disabled , respectively. For example:
gcloud compute instances create instance-name \
--image image-name \
--image-project cos-cloud \
--metadata cos-update-strategy=update_disabled
Starting from milestone 97 ,
you can also disable or enable automatic updates in project metadata:
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata \
--metadata cos-update-strategy=update_disabled
Note: Metadata flags defined at instance level takes precedence over metadata
flags defined at project level.
You can also disable automatic updates on a running instance with systemctl :
sudo systemctl stop update-engine
sudo systemctl mask update-engine
