Debugging node issues using toolbox
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You might need to install additional packages or tools on Container-Optimized OS
for certain tasks, such as debugging. For example, debug node connectivity
issues by
installing tcpdump in toolbox .
Although Container-Optimized OS does not
include a package manager, you can use the pre-installed
toolbox
utility to install any additional packages or tools you require. Using
/usr/bin/toolbox is the preferred method for installing and running one-off
debugging tools.
Note: toolbox is a debugging utility and not intended for production use. Note: For some small machine types, such as e2-micro, extracting large container
images like the default toolbox base image might be slow. It might be better
to use a smaller base image with only the specific tools you need installed. See
Customize toolbox for your deployment for more details.
/usr/bin/toolbox essentially provides you a shell in a Debian chroot-like
environment. When you invoke /usr/bin/toolbox , it runs following commands:
docker pull and docker create to set up the environment. These are only
run the first time you invoke /usr/bin/toolbox .
systemd-nspawn to run the given command or (in absence of any command)
provides you a shell
toolbox has some other properties to keep in mind:
Invoking toolbox after the first invocation does not require a working
Docker daemon, nor does it incur any network or disk overhead.
The toolbox environment is set up once for each user invoking it. Running
sudo toolbox sets it up for root user.
The toolbox environment is created under /var/lib/toolbox and is
persistent across reboots.
You can access sections of the root file system, such as user home
directories, from inside the toolbox environment.
Customize toolbox for your deployment
In the following examples, we assume that your username is USER and your
Container-Optimized OS instance name is cos-dev .
You can customize the Docker image that toolbox uses, as well as the paths
available to toolbox in the root file system. These settings are located in
the file /etc/default/toolbox . The default /etc/default/toolbox file
typically resembles the following:
USER@cos-dev ~ $ cat /etc/default/toolbox
# Copyright 2016 The Chromium OS Authors. All rights reserved.
# Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
# found in the LICENSE file.
TOOLBOX_DOCKER_IMAGE = "gcr.io/cos-cloud/toolbox"
TOOLBOX_DOCKER_TAG = "v20220722"
TOOLBOX_BIND = "--bind=/:/media/root/ --bind=/mnt/disks/:/media/root/mnt/disks/ --bind=/var/:/media/root/var/ --bind=/home:/media/root/home/ --bind=/etc/resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf"
: ${ USER :=root }
The TOOLBOX_DOCKER_IMAGE and TOOLBOX_DOCKER_TAG variables specify the
Docker image to be used. The default gcr.io/cos-cloud/toolbox
comes with some of the common tools like the Google Cloud CLI
pre-installed.
The TOOLBOX_BIND variable specifies the paths from rootfs to be made
available inside the toolbox environment.
To change the default settings, modify the /etc/default/toolbox file, or
specify new values for the variables in ${HOME}/.toolboxrc for the appropriate
user. For example, assuming that you want toolbox to use fedora:latest as
its container, you can run the following commands:
USER@cos-dev ~ $ echo "TOOLBOX_DOCKER_IMAGE=docker.io/library/fedora" > " ${ HOME } /.toolboxrc"
USER@cos-dev ~ $ echo "TOOLBOX_DOCKER_TAG=latest" >> " ${ HOME } /.toolboxrc"
USER@cos-dev ~ $ toolbox
The /etc/default/toolbox file can be modified as shown in the following.
USER@cos-dev ~ $ cat /etc/default/toolbox
# Copyright 2016 The Chromium OS Authors. All rights reserved.
# Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
# found in the LICENSE file.
TOOLBOX_DOCKER_IMAGE = "gcr.io/cos-cloud/toolbox"
TOOLBOX_DOCKER_TAG = "v20220722"
TOOLBOX_DOCKER_IMAGE_TARBALL = <var> [ location/to/tarball ] </var>
TOOLBOX_BIND = "--bind=/:/media/root/ --bind=/mnt/disks/:/media/root/mnt/disks/ --bind=/var/:/media/root/var/ --bind=/home:/media/root/home/"
: ${ USER :=root }
USER@cos-dev ~ $ toolbox
Install and run tools from toolbox
Once you've invoked the toolbox utility to start the shell, you can use
apt-get inside the resulting container to install packages. For example:
# Inside the toolbox shell
USER@cos-dev ~ $ toolbox
root@cos-dev:~# apt-get update && apt-get install -y htop psmisc
root@cos-dev:~# htop
root@cos-dev:~# pstree -p
root@cos-dev:~# exit
You don't always have to enter toolbox to run commands in it. You can
prefix your commands with toolbox . For example, to install and run the
strace utility to trace the execution of the Docker daemon, you can do the
following:
USER@cos-dev ~ $ toolbox apt-get install -y strace
USER@cos-dev ~ $ toolbox strace -p ` pidof dockerd `
The Google Cloud CLI is pre-installed in toolbox:
USER@cos-dev ~ $ toolbox
root@cos-dev:~# which gcloud
/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud
# View installed components
root@cos-dev:~# gcloud components list
Your current gcloud CLI version is: 287 .0.0
The latest available version is: 295 .0.0
...
Keep in mind that the gcloud CLI can only access resources that the
VM instance is authorized to access. Read the
Compute Engine documentation to
learn more about provisioning VM instances with access to other resources.
Read the Google Cloud CLI documentation to
learn more about using the gcloud CLI.
Get files into and out of toolbox
The root file system of the host is accessible inside toolbox through the
/media/root path. On the host, the root directory of toolbox is accessible
through the following path:
/var/lib/toolbox/USER-gcr.io_cos-cloud_toolbox-VERSION/root
where USER is your username and VERSION is the toolbox version number
(for example, v20220722 ).
The following examples show how to get files into and out of toolbox :
# Access the host filesystem inside the toolbox
USER@cos-dev ~ $ toolbox
root@cos-dev:~# ls /media/root
bin boot dev etc home lib lib64 ...
root@cos-dev:~# cp /media/root/home/USER/some-file .
# Access toolbox directory from the host
USER@cos-dev ~ $ sudo cp some-file /var/lib/toolbox/USER-gcr.io_cos-cloud_toolbox-v20220722/root
# Run a command inside toolbox and save its output in your home directory
USER@cos-dev ~ $ toolbox strace -o /media/root/ $HOME /ls.strace ls
USER@cos-dev ~ $ more $HOME /ls.strace
Clean up disk space used by toolbox
The toolbox installation consumes approximately 2-3 GB of disk
space in /var (disk usage varies with the Container-Optimized OS version). To
free disk space used by toolbox, perform the following tasks depending on your
Container-Optimized OS version:
# remove files in /var/lib/toolbox
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/toolbox/*
# remove container artifacts
sudo ctr images rm $IMAGE_NAME
You can run sudo ctr images ls -q to determine this value. For example,
IMAGE_NAME=gcr.io/cos-cloud/toolbox:v20220722 .
