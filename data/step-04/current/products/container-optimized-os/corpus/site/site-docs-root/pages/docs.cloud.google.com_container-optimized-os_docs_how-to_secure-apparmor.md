Securing containers with AppArmor
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
AppArmor is a Linux kernel security
module that you can use to restrict the capabilities of processes running on the
host operating system. Each process can have its own security profile. The
security profile allows or disallows specific capabilities, such as network access
or file read/write/execute permissions.
You can use AppArmor with the Docker containers running on your
Container-Optimized OS instances. For any given container, you can apply either
the default AppArmor security profile that comes with Docker, or a custom security
profile that you provide.
Using the default Docker AppArmor security profile
When you start a container on your Container-Optimized OS instance, the system
automatically applies the docker-default AppArmor security profile. The following
example command runs a container with the docker-default security profile:
docker run --rm -it debian:jessie bash -i
To test the docker-default security profile, you can try to read the
/proc/sysrq-trigger file with the cat command, as follows:
root @88 cef496c1a5 :/ # cat / proc / sysrq - trigger
The output should contain a "Permission Denied" error, similar to the following:
cat: /proc/sysrq-trigger: Permission denied
Note: See Docker's AppArmor security profiles for Docker
documentation for additional information on Docker's default AppArmor security
profile.
Applying a custom security profile
To apply a different security profile, use the apparmor=<profile-name>
command-line option when you run your container. The following example command
runs a container with a security profile called no-ping :
docker run --rm -i --security-opt apparmor=no-ping debian:jessie bash -i
See Creating a custom security profile
later in this topic for more information on creating the no-ping profile
specified in the example.
You can also specify unconfined with the apparmor option to indicate that
the container is to be run with no security profile, as in the following
example:
docker run --rm -it --security-opt apparmor=unconfined debian:jessie bash -i
Viewing the active AppArmor security profiles
You can see what AppArmor profile, if any, applies to the processes on your
Container-Optimized OS instance by inspecting the /proc/<pid>/attr/current
file, where <pid> is the process ID.
Suppose you have the following processes running on your instance (shown by the
ps -ef | grep '[b]ash -i' command):
root 1903 1897 0 21:58 pts/3 00:00:00 docker run --rm -it debian:jessie bash -i
root 1927 1913 0 21:58 pts/4 00:00:00 bash -i
root 1978 1001 0 22:01 pts/0 00:00:00 docker run --rm -it --security-opt apparmor=unconfined debian:jessie bash -i
root 2001 1988 0 22:01 pts/2 00:00:00 bash -i
Note: You can also add the -Z flag to your ps command to display the
security profile for each process.
If you inspect /proc/1927/attr/current , you should see the following output
that indicates the process ( pid 1927 ) was run with the default Docker security
profile:
# cat /proc/1927/attr/current
docker-default (enforce)
If you inspect /proc/2001/attr/current , you should see the following output
that indicates the process ( pid 2001 ) was run with no security profile (that
is, with the option apparmor=unconfined ):
# cat /proc/2001/attr/current
unconfined
Creating a custom security profile
If process requires a different security profile than docker-default ,
you can write your own custom profile. To use a custom profile, you must create
the profile file and then load that file into AppArmor.
For example, suppose you want a security profile that disallows all raw network
traffic. The following script creates a file for a security profile called
no-ping at /etc/apparmor.d/no_raw_net :
cat > /etc/apparmor.d/no_raw_net <<EOF
# include <tunables/global>
profile no-ping flags=(attach_disconnected,mediate_deleted) {
#include <abstractions/base>
network inet tcp,
network inet udp,
network inet icmp,
deny network raw,
deny network packet,
file,
mount,
}
EOF
Once you've created the security profile file, you can use apparmor_parser to
load the profile into AppArmor:
/sbin/apparmor_parser --replace --write-cache /etc/apparmor.d/no_raw_net
Once loaded, you can test the no-ping profile as follows:
$ docker run --rm -i --security-opt apparmor = no-ping debian:jessie ping -c3 8 .8.8.8
The command creates a container with the no-ping security profile and attempts
to run ping from within the container. The security profile should disallow
the traffic, resulting in an error like the following:
ping : Lacking privilege for raw socket .
To ensure that your custom security profile is present when your
Container-Optimized OS instance boots, and remains persistent across reboots,
you can use cloud-init to install the profile in /etc/apparmor.d . To do so,
add a cloud-config script to your instance's metadata as the value of the
user-data key.
The following cloud-config script adds the no-ping profile to
/etc/apparmor.d :
# cloud-configs
write_files:
- path: /etc/apparmor.d/no_raw_net
permissions: 0644
owner: root
content: |
#include <tunables/global>
profile no-ping flags=(attach_disconnected,mediate_deleted) {
#include <abstractions/base>
network inet tcp,
network inet udp,
network inet icmp,
deny network raw,
deny network packet,
file,
mount,
}
To ensure that your service file loads your custom profile into AppArmor and
tells Docker to use it, run the following commands on your instance:
ExecStartPre=/sbin/apparmor_parser -r -W /etc/apparmor.d/no_raw_net
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --security-opt apparmor=no-ping ...
After you've run the commands, reboot your instance, and you can then run your
container confined by your custom AppArmor profile.
