This document explains what the CIS Benchmark is, how the benchmark relates to Container-Optimized OS (COS), how to audit the status of compliance in the instance and how to troubleshoot in case of failure.
Overview
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice security recommendations for various platforms. The Container-Optimized OS CIS Benchmark is a set of recommendations for configuring instances that use Container-Optimized OS to support a strong security posture. Both COS x86 and ARM images are CIS compliant.
Accessing the Benchmark
The Container-Optimized OS CIS Benchmark is available on the CIS website:
Go to the CIS Benchmarks downloads page .
Search for CIS Google Container-Optimized OS Benchmark .
Click Download PDF .
Security recommendation levels
CIS defines the following recommendation levels for Container-Optimized OS.
Level 1
Recommendations at this level are meant to be applicable to the majority of environments. This level includes recommendations such as the following:
Address space layout randomization is enabled
/tmp cannot be used for running executable binaries
Packet redirect sending is disabled
Level 2
Recommendations at this level extend the Level 1 recommendations, resulting in a more stringent security environment. The Level 2 recommendations are not necessarily applicable to all cases as they may require application changes. You should evaluate the recommendations at Level 2 for your environment before you apply them. This level includes recommendations such as the following:
Firewall rules exist for all open ports
ICMP redirects and router advertisements are not accepted
Default user shell timeout is 900 seconds or less
How Container-Optimized OS complies with the CIS Benchmarks
Starting with Milestone 97 , Container-Optimized OS images comply with to CIS Level 1 by default and provide an option to comply with CIS Level 2. We also provide a scanner that you can use to audit your instance against the CIS recommendation levels.
The CIS configuration defining the recommendations is present at /usr/share/google/security/cis-compliance/cis_config.textproto . The CIS scanner uses the configuration to check the compliance status of the instance. The results of each run of the CIS level compliance scanner are written to /var/lib/google/cis_scanner_scan_result.textproto . This file is overwritten on each run of the CIS scanner. If any of the CIS Level 1 or Level 2 scans fail, the cis_scanner_scan_result.textproto file will contain a list of all failing checks.
Note: Arm-based Container-Optimized OS images don't comply with the CIS benchmarks.
Check instance compliance status
Container-Optimized OS images provide the following systemd services for compliance checking and configuration:
cis-level1.service : Enabled by default and starts on boot. When the service starts, it checks if the instance complies with CIS Level 1.
cis-level2.service : Disabled by default. This service lets you configure the instance to comply with CIS Level 2, and checks the compliance status against both Level 1 and Level 2.
The following sections explain how to check the compliance status of the instance and how to automate the audit process.
Check CIS Level 1 compliance status
To see if your instance is CIS Level 1 compliant, check the status of the cis-level1.service :
systemctl status cis-level1
The output is similar to the following:
Reading scan config from /usr/share/google/security/cis-compliance/cis_config.textproto
Running scan of 62 benchmarks
Scan status: SUCCEEDED
Found 0 non-compliant benchmarks
Writing scan results to /var/lib/google/cis_scanner_scan_result.textproto
If there are any non-compliant checks found, refer to CIS compliance Level 1/Level 2 check fails .
The cis-level1.service checks for CIS Level 1 compliance only once, when the
instance boots. To configure periodic compliance checking, refer to Periodic checking of CIS compliance status .
Configure CIS Level 2 compliance and check status
You can use the cis-level2 service to configure the instance to comply with CIS Level 2 and to check compliance status against both Level 1 and Level 2. The systemd service supports all of the CIS Level 2 recommendations except for the following:
4.1.1.2 Ensure Logging is running (ID: logging-service-running)
This recommendation is opted-out by default but can be re-enabled by deleting the ID from the opted-out list which can be found in the /etc/cis-scanner/env_vars file. This check only exists in milestones 109 and later. In earlier milestones, enabling Logging yourself makes you compliant with this recommendation. If you undo the opt-out, running the cis-level2 service runs a script that starts fluent-bit logging. Keep logging-service-running opted out if you don't want to use our default logging or you want to use your own logging.
For the following recommendations, cis-level2 service configures the instance but does not verify the compliance status:
105 and lower:
3.3.1.1 Ensure IPv6 default deny firewall policy
3.3.1.2 Ensure IPv6 loopback traffic is configured
3.3.1.3 Ensure IPv6 outbound and established connections are configured
3.3.1.4 Ensure IPv6 firewall rules exist for all open ports
3.3.2.1 Ensure default deny firewall policy
3.3.2.2 Ensure loopback traffic is configured
3.3.2.3 Ensure outbound and established connections are configured
109 and later:
3.3.1.4 Ensure IPv6 firewall rules exist for all open ports
The cis-level2 service is disabled by default. To start the service, run the following command:
systemctl start cis-level2.service
To see if your instance is successfully configured and complies with CIS Level 2 recommendations, check the status of cis-level2.service :
systemctl status cis-level2
The output is similar to the following:
Reading scan config from /usr/share/google/security/cis-compliance/cis_config.textproto
Running scan of 112 benchmarks
Scan status: SUCCEEDED
Found 0 non-compliant benchmarks
Writing scan results to /var/lib/google/cis_scanner_scan_result.textproto
If the instance configuration fails or there are any non-compliant checks found, refer to Troubleshooting .
The cis-level2 service configures the instance and checks for the CIS Level 2 compliance only once. To configure periodic compliance checking, refer to Periodic checking of CIS compliance status .
Periodic checking of CIS compliance status
Container-Optimized OS images include the following services to periodically check CIS compliance:
cis-compliance-scanner.service : checks the compliance status based on environment variables defined at /etc/cis-scanner/env_vars . By default, this service checks for CIS Level 1 compliance and is disabled.
cis-compliance-scanner.timer : runs cis-compliance-scanner.service periodically. The default period is once a day.
Configure the scanner service
The cis-compliance-scanner.service is responsible for checking the status of CIS compliance based on the environment variables defined at /etc/cis-scanner/env_vars . By default, this service checks for CIS Level 1 compliance.
To check CIS Level 2 compliance, set the LEVEL environment variable in /etc/cis-scanner/env_vars to 2 . The /etc/cis-scanner/env_vars file is similar to the following:
# cis-compliance-scanner.service environment variables
# The config file defines which checks to perform by cis_scanner
CONFIG="/usr/share/google/security/cis-compliance/cis_config.textproto"
# Where to store the result of the scan
RESULT="/var/lib/google/cis_scanner_scan_result.textproto"
# Upto which level to scan. It can be 1 or 2
LEVEL="2"
# Extra options that can be passed to cis_scanner
# For valid options, see output of `cis_scanner -h`
EXTRA_OPTIONS=""
Configure the timer
To set up periodic compliance scanning, start the cis-compliance-scanner.timer unit:
systemctl start cis-compliance-scanner.timer
By default, cis-compliance-scanner.timer starts cis-compliance-scanner.service once a day. To change the scanning period, override the OnUnitActiveSec field of the cis-compliance-scanner.timer unit:
sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/cis-compliance-scanner.timer.d
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/cis-compliance-scanner.timer.d/override.conf <<EOF
[ Unit ]
Description = Run CIS Scanner once an hour
[ Timer ]
OnUnitActiveSec = 1h
EOF
This example sets the scanner period to once every hour.
To apply the changes, reload systemd units:
systemctl daemon-reload
Opting out of specific CIS compliance checks
CIS Level 1 and Level 2 recommendations are made to be applicable to most environments. However ,some recommendations might not be applicable to your specific environment. To opt out of specific recommendations, use the EXTRA_OPTIONS environment variable in /etc/cis-scanner/env_vars .
The following example env_vars file opts out of the etc-passwd-permissions recommendation:
# cis-compliance-scanner.service environment variables
# The config file defines which checks to perform by cis_scanner
CONFIG="/usr/share/google/security/cis-compliance/cis_config.textproto"
# Where to store the result of the scan
RESULT="/var/lib/google/cis_scanner_scan_result.textproto"
# Upto which level to scan. It can be 1 or 2
LEVEL="1"
# Extra options that can be passed to cis_scanner
# For valid options:`cis_scanner -h`
EXTRA_OPTIONS="--benchmark-opt-out-ids=etc-passwd-permissions"
Automate enabling and checking of CIS compliance status
You can automate the compliance checking process for your instances using cloud-init or OS Policy. The following examples show some use cases with each tool:
Example 1: check CIS Level 1 compliance once a day.
Example 2: check CIS Level 1 compliance once an hour.
Example 3: check CIS Level 2 compliance once a day.
Example 4: opt-out of specific CIS compliance check.
Using cloud-init
Before you try the following examples, ensure that you're familiar with configuring a COS instance with cloud-init by following the instructions at Using cloud-init with the Cloud config format .
Example 1
The following example configuration starts periodic CIS Level 1 scanning with the default period of once a day.
#cloud-config
runcmd :
# Check the compliance status of the instance once a day.
- systemctl start cis-compliance-scanner.timer
Example 2
The following example configures periodic CIS Level 1 scanning once every hour.
#cloud-config
# Override cis-compliance-scanner.timer with 1 hour frequency.

- systemctl start cis-compliance-scanner.timer
Example 3
The following example configures periodic CIS Level 2 scanning with the default period of once a day.
#cloud-config
runcmd :
# Configure the instance for CIS level 2.
- systemctl start cis-level2.service
# Change the scan level to CIS Level 2.
- sed -i 's/^LEVEL=.*$/LEVEL="2"/' /etc/cis-scanner/env_vars
# Check the compliance status of the instance once a day.
- systemctl start cis-compliance-scanner.timer
Example 4
The following example configures the scanner to run once a day and opts out of a specific CIS recommendation.
#cloud-config
runcmd :
# Opt-out of the etc-passwd-permissions check.
- sed -i 's/^EXTRA.*$/EXTRA_OPTIONS="--benchmark-opt-out-ids=etc-passwd-permissions"/' /etc/cis-scanner/env_vars
# Check the compliance of the instance once a day.
- systemctl start cis-compliance-scanner.timer
Using OS Policy
You can use an OS Policy to configure CIS Benchmark scanning. Before you begin, ensure that you're familiar with OS Policy, including the following:
Writing OS Policy
OS Policy assignment
Viewing OS Policy assignment reports
In addition, you must add the instanceFilter and rollout options in the
following examples for the deployment.
Example 1
The following example configuration starts periodic CIS Level 1 scanning with the default period of once a day.

Troubleshooting
This section describes how to resolve issues related to CIS benchmark scanning.
Configuring an instance to comply with CIS Level 2 recommendations fails
The cis-level2 service first configures the instance to comply with CIS
Level 2 recommendations and then checks for compliance with both CIS Level 1 and Level 2. In case configuring the instance fails, the cis-level2 service exits with the following error message:
Job for cis-level2.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status cis-level2.service" and "journalctl -xeu cis-level2.service" for details.
The journal logs will mention the recommendations which failed to apply on the instance and resulting into failure of cis-level2 systemd service.
CIS compliance Level 1 or Level 2 check fails
The scanning results for each run of CIS level compliance are written at /var/lib/google/cis_scanner_scan_result.textproto . If any of the CIS Level 1 or Level 2 scans fail, the textproto file will contain the list of all failing checks, such as in the following example:
cat /var/lib/google/cis_scanner_scan_result.textproto
# Output
start_time: {
seconds: 1648241700
nanos: 763152171
}
end_time: {
seconds: 1648241700
nanos: 812992527
}
scanner_version: "1.1.4.3"
benchmark_version: "1.0.0"
status: {
status: SUCCEEDED
}
non_compliant_benchmarks: {
id: "etc-passwd-permissions"
compliance_occurrence: {
non_compliant_files: {
path: "/etc/passwd"
reason: "File permission is 0664, expected the following bits to be set: 0444 and the following bits to be clear: 0133"
}
}
}
compliant_benchmarks: {
id: "etc-passwd-permissions"
compliance_occurrence: {}
}
To mitigate the failed checks, use the CIS Benchmark and follow the steps in the Remediation section for the failing check to make the instance compliant. To find which recommendation corresponds to a failing check in the CIS Benchmark, look up the non_compliant_benchmark's ID in the CIS scanner config file located at /usr/share/google/security/cis-compliance/cis_config.textproto .
