Automatic updates
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Container-Optimized OS images have the built-in capability to automatically
upgrade to a newer version when released. This capability, when enabled, allows
user instances to stay up-to-date with respect to security fixes and bug fixes.
When Container-Optimized OS is used as part of a managed service (for example,
Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud SQL, etc.), the managed service takes care of updating
the Container-Optimized OS instance for the users. So, automatic updates are
disabled on those by default.
Users running production workloads that are sensitive to kernel upgrades and
require controlled qualification and rollout should also disable automatic
updates. For more information, see the Disabling automatic updates
section.
Note: In-place updates are not supported on Container-Optimized OS VMs with
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot enabled. UEFI Secure
Boot is not enabled on Container-Optimized OS VMs by default. To learn more
about UEFI Secure Boot, see the Shielded VM documentation . Note: In-place updates are not supported on Container-Optimized OS Arm-based
images.
Enable or disable automatic updates
In milestone 117 and later, the automatic updates feature is disabled by default
on all Container-Optimized OS images. In milestones earlier than 117, the
feature is enabled by default. You can enable or disable automatic updates by
setting the cos-update-strategy metadata on new instances, existing instances,
or on all instances in a project, as described in the following sections.
Configure auto-updates on a new instance
Create a new instance with automatic updates enabled:
gcloud compute instances create INSTANCE_NAME \
--metadata cos-update-strategy = update_enabled
Create a new instance with automatic updates disabled:
gcloud compute instances create INSTANCE_NAME \
--metadata cos-update-strategy = update_disabled
Configure auto-updates on an existing instance
Enable automatic updates for an existing instance:
gcloud compute instances add-metadata INSTANCE_NAME \
--metadata cos-update-strategy = update_enabled
Disable automatic updates for an existing instance:
gcloud compute instances add-metadata INSTANCE_NAME \
--metadata cos-update-strategy = update_disabled
Configure auto-updates on all instances in a project
Starting from milestone 97 ,
you can enable or disable auto-updates for all instances in a project using
metadata flags in project metadata.
Enable updates for all instances in a project:
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata \
--metadata cos-update-strategy = update_enabled
Disable updates for all instances in a project:
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata \
--metadata cos-update-strategy = update_disabled
Note: Metadata flags defined at the instance level take precedence over metadata
flags defined at project level.
Automatic update design
Container-Optimized OS uses an active-passive root partition scheme. The OS
image is updated in its entirety, including the kernel, as opposed to
package-by-package updates like on traditional Linux distributions. The image
ships with the automatic updates feature enabled; this means that a default
Container-Optimized OS instance always downloads the latest OS version and
installs it on the passive partition soon after it's released.
If you are using
an image from LTS milestone
or cos-stable image family, then you will get an update of the latest OS version
from the same milestone. On cos-dev and cos-beta image family, the update will
be the latest OS version from the corresponding image family.
Note: The update does not take effect until the instance is rebooted, and the
auto-updater does not force reboot when an update is installed. After an updated
version has been installed, the instance must be rebooted before it can update
to a newer version.
Changes to automatic update behavior
The Container-Optimized OS team is actively working on improving our backend
infrastructure that makes automatic updates possible. As part of these changes,
we are rotating the keys used to sign and validate the update payloads. However,
images released before the key rotation cannot be automatically updated to
images released after the rotation. The affected list of images are as followings:
These images cannot be updated to latest versions:
On Milestone 77: images prior to cos-77-12371-1000-0
On Milestone 81: images prior to cos-81-12871-1000-0
On Milestone 85: images prior to cos-85-13310-1000-0
On Milestone 86: images prior to cos-dev-86-15053-0-0
These images will no longer receive any updates:
All milestones before 77, including any previously deprecated milestones.
Users running standalone Container-Optimized OS with any of the affected versions, and
having the auto-update feature enabled, will not see their instances being updated to newer versions.
In these cases, users should manually choose newer OS versions by recreating their
VM instances with the newer image. Automatic updates will continue to work on all supported
milestones for new releases.
Note: Users using Container-Optimized OS as part of a managed service (for example,
Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud SQL, etc.) are not affected.
