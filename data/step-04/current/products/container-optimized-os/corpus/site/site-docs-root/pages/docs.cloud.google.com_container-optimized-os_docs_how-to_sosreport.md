Collecting debugging information using sosreport
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Container-Optimized OS includes the sosreport utility, which collects
information on demand to help you debug problems in a Container-Optimized OS
virtual machine instance. The information is collected and stored locally on
the filesystem of the instance. Google does not collect or store this data
elsewhere.
If you open a support case with Google Cloud support
due to problems with your instance, you may be asked to provide the sosreport
data as part of the investigation. This page shows you how to collect this
information.
Note: Creating the report consumes CPU and memory resource, and storing the
report consumes disk space and disk I/O bandwidth resource on the node. The
amount of resource consumed cannot be easily estimated. Note: When troubleshooting node availability and startup issues, collecting
sosreport might be challenging. Node auto-repair will terminate and re-create
the node after some time of unavailability. See Disabling node auto-repair
if sosreport collection cannot be done before the node is terminated by auto-repair.
If auto-repair cannot be disabled because the cluster is in release channel, contact
Cloud Customer Care for assistance.
The output of sosreport is stored without encryption in a .tar.xz archive.
The archive may contain personally identifiable information (PII), because it
collects data from many critical system components (e.g. journald). The archive
can be inspected on the instance, and most content is in plain text. The
sosreport tool is open source, and you can
review its code .
Collecting the sosreport data
To generate a sosreport:
Connect to the instance using the gcloud compute ssh command.
gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --project [PROJECT_ID]
Check the OS version:
sudo cat /etc/os-release | egrep -w 'NAME|VERSION'
The output is similar to the following:
NAME="Container-Optimized OS"
VERSION=105
Run the sos command that corresponds to your OS version:
COS 85 and earlier
Run the following sosreport command to collect the logs:
sudo sosreport --all-logs --batch --tmp-dir = /var
If the previous command fails with sosreport: command not found , install the
sosreport package and then run the previous sosreport command:
sudo toolbox
sudo apt install sosreport -y
COS 105 and later
Run the following sos command to collect the logs:
sudo sos report --all-logs --batch --tmp-dir = /var
If the previous command fails with sos: command not found , install the
sosreport package and then run the previous sos report command:
sudo toolbox
sudo apt install sosreport -y
Ubuntu-18 and earlier
Run the following sosreport command to collect the logs:
sudo sosreport --all-logs --batch --tmp-dir = /var
If the previous command fails with sosreport: command not found , install the
sosreport package and then run the previous sosreport command:
sudo apt install sosreport
Ubuntu-20 and later
Run the following sos command to collect the logs:
sudo sos report --all-logs --batch --tmp-dir = /var
If the previous command fails with sos: command not found , install the
sosreport package and then run the previous sos report command:
sudo apt install sosreport
You can change the directory where the report is stored by passing a
different directory to the --tmp-dir option. You can also change the command's
default behavior by editing /etc/sos.conf on the instance.
The output is stored in a .tar.xz file in the directory you specify using the
--tmp-dir option. The location and checksum of the .tar.xz file is shown on
STDOUT.
Your sosreport has been generated and saved in:
/var/sosreport-cos-20181106231224.tar.xz
The checksum is: 5a8b97c6020346a688254c8b04ef86ec
Viewing the collected data
The report is owned by root and is not readable by other users. Use the
following commands to change the owner to your current user and make it readable
by you. Do not make it world-readable.
TARBALL= [PATH/TO/TARBALL]
sudo chown $(whoami) $TARBALL
chmod +r $TARBALL
Then, if you want to view the content of the report on the node, you can extract
it by running below command:
tar xvf $TARBALL
The individual report files are now available in a directory in the same
location as the .tar.xz . You can view the logs using commands such as less , or you
can use commands such as grep to find information in them.
Note: If you plan to share the report with Google, please do not modify any
files in the report. If you have to modify some files, please also tell us
what was modified when sharing the report.
Download the report
To download the report to your local machine, use the gcloud compute scp
command:
gcloud compute scp $(whoami)@ [INSTANCE_NAME] : [PATH/TO/FILE] [LOCAL/PATH/TO/DIRECTORY]
