Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
To create alert policies and filter logs, you must use the Logging query language . The following table details the fields in the
Unified Maintenance resource ResourceMaintenance . Use these fields to write
query operations for Unified Maintenance resources.

Fields
resource
MonitoredResource
resource.type
string Set to the monitored resource type of the targeted resource. For example, Cloud SQL instance: cloudsql_database
resource.labels
map (key: string, value: string) Labels that uniquely identify a target resource (see a list of labels in monitored resource types ).
labels
map (key: string, value: string) Key-value pair used to filter logs entries. Possible keys: maintenance.googleapis.com/new_resource_maintenance - set to True for the first log entry for a ResourceMaintenance maintenance.googleapis.com/updated_fields - a list of updated ResourceMaintenance fields, for example: "['state','maintenanceScheduledStartTime','maintenanceScheduledEndTime']"
insertId
string A unique identifier for the log entry.
timestamp
string (Timestamp format) The time the event described by the log entry occurred. This time is used to compute the log entry's age and to enforce the logs retention period.
receiveTimestamp
string (Timestamp format) The time the log entry was received by Logging.
