Control maintenance
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Depending on the service used, you might have the ability to reschedule or
perform on-demand updates. See the type of controls supported by various products
in the Supported services .
Reschedule maintenance
For products that support rescheduling a scheduled maintenance, you might find a
link to reschedule the maintenance in the description field of the log.
For example, the description might look similar to the following:
Your instance is scheduled to undergo routine
maintenance. As a managed service, Cloud SQL automatically updates instances to
ensure that the underlying hardware, operating system, and database engine are
reliable, performant, secure, and up-to-date. Most of these updates are performed
while your Cloud SQL instance is up and running. However, certain system updates
require a brief service interruption and are referred to as maintenance which
typically happens once every few months. Learn more: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/maintenance
For rescheduling the maintenance see - https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/maintenance#reschedule-maintenance
Perform on-demand updates
Some Google Cloud products allow the user to apply maintenance on-demand. For
these products, you can find more information on how to perform updates within
the description of the event.
The description might look similar to the following:
Description: A Google Cloud Compute Engine instance
undergoes planned maintenance to update important hardware and/or software
components. During planned maintenance, the host maintenance policy configured
for the instance will be used to perform the update. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/setting-vm-host-options#viewoptions
You can perform on-demand maintenance ahead of this schedule with this instance.
