Attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster or a self-managed cluster
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
After you create a Dataproc Metastore service, you can attach any of
the following services:
A Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
A self-managed Apache Hive instance,
an Apache Spark instance,
or a Presto cluster.
After you connect one of these services, it uses your
Dataproc Metastore service as its Hive metastore during query execution.
Before you begin
Enable Dataproc Metastore in your project.
Create a Dataproc Metastore service .
Understand networking requirements specific to your project.
Required Roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create a Dataproc Metastore and a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
To grant full control of Dataproc Metastore resources, either:
Dataproc Metastore Editor ( roles/metastore.editor )
on the user account or service account
Dataproc Metastore Admin ( roles/metastore.admin )
on the user account or service account
To create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster:
( roles/dataproc.worker )
on the Managed Service for Apache Spark VM service account
To grant read and write permissions to the Hive warehouse directory:
( roles/storage.objectAdmin )
on the Managed Service for Apache Spark VM service account
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to create a Dataproc Metastore and a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to create a Dataproc Metastore and a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster:
To create a Dataproc Metastore:
metastore.services.create
on the user account or service account
To create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster:
dataproc.clusters.create
on the user account or service account
To access the Hive warehouse directory:
orgpolicy.policy.get1 , resourcemanager.projects.get , resourcemanager.projects.list , storage.objects.* , storage.multipartUploads.*
on the Managed Service for Apache Spark VM service account
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
For more information about specific Dataproc Metastore roles and permissions, see Manage access with IAM .
Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters
Managed Service for Apache Spark is a managed Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop service that
lets you take advantage of open source data tools for batch processing,
querying, streaming, and machine learning.
Considerations
Before you create and attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster,
check what endpoint protocol
your Dataproc Metastore service is using. This protocol defines how
your Hive Metastore clients access metadata stored in your Dataproc Metastore.
This choice can also affect the features that you can integrate and use
with your service.
Apache Thrift
If you use the Apache Thrift endpoint protocol, consider the
following network requirements:
By default, you should create your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster and
Dataproc Metastore service on the same network. Your
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster can also use a subnet of the
Dataproc Metastore service's network.
If your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster belongs to a different project than
the network, you must configure shared network permissions .
If your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster belongs to a different project
than your Dataproc Metastore service,
you must set up additional permissions
before creating a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
gRPC
If you use the gRPC endpoint protocol, consider the
following network requirements:
After you create a Dataproc Metastore using the gRPC endpoint
protocol, you must grant additional IAM roles .
If you're using Dataproc Personal Cluster Authentication ,
your Dataproc Metastore must use the gRPC endpoint protocol.
If your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster belongs to a different project
than your Dataproc Metastore service,
you must set up additional permissions
before creating a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
Create a cluster and attach a Dataproc Metastore
The following instructions show you how to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster and connect to it from a Dataproc Metastore service. These
instructions assume you have already Created a Dataproc Metastore service .
Before creating your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, make sure the
Managed Service for Apache Spark image you choose is compatible with the Hive metastore version
you selected when you created your Dataproc Metastore.
For more information, see Managed Service for Apache Spark Image version list .
To optimize network connectivity, create the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
in the same region as your Dataproc Metastore service.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the Managed Service for Apache Spark Create a cluster page:
Open Create a cluster
In the Cluster Name field, enter a name for your cluster.
For the Region and Zone menus, select the same region
that you created your Dataproc Metastore service in.
You can choose any Zone.
Click the Customize cluster tab.
In the Network configuration section, select the same network that
you created your Dataproc Metastore service in.
In the Dataproc Metastore section, select the
Dataproc Metastore service you want to
attach. If you haven't created one yet, you can select Create
New Service .
Note: if you don't see your Dataproc Metastore service
in this list, double check which region you selected for
your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster. Both services must be configured
to use the same region.
Optional: If your Dataproc Metastore service uses the gRPC
endpoint protocol:
Click the Manage Security tab.
In the Project Access section, select
Enable the cloud-platform scope for this cluster .
Configure the remaining service options as needed.
To create the cluster, click Create .
Your new cluster appears in the Clusters list. The cluster status is listed
as Provisioning until the cluster is ready to use. When it's ready for use,
the status changes to Running .
gcloud CLI
To create a cluster and attach a Dataproc Metastore, run the
following gcloud dataproc clusters create
command:
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--dataproc-metastore=projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /services/ SERVICE \
--region= LOCATION \
--scopes= SCOPES
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your new
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the
project you created your Dataproc Metastore service in.
LOCATION : the same region you created your
Dataproc Metastore service in.
SERVICE : the name of the
Dataproc Metastore service that you're attaching to the
cluster.
SCOPES : (Optional) If your Dataproc Metastore
service uses the gRPC endpoint protocol, use cloud-platform .
REST
Follow the API instructions to create a cluster
by using the APIs Explorer.
Attach a cluster using Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster properties
You can also attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster to a Dataproc Metastore
using Managed Service for Apache Spark properties .
These properties include the Dataproc Metastore ENDPOINT_URI and
WAREHOUSE_DIR .
Use these instructions if your Dataproc Metastore
service uses Private Service Connect
or if you want to attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster to the auxiliary version
of your Dataproc Metastore service.
There are two ways that you can attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster using the
ENDPOINT_URI and WAREHOUSE_DIR properties:
Option 1: While creating a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
When creating a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, use the properties flag with
the following Hive configuration.
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--properties="hive:hive.metastore.uris= ENDPOINT_URI ,hive:hive.metastore.warehouse.dir= WAREHOUSE_DIR /hive-warehouse"
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your new Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster.
ENDPOINT_URI : The endpoint URI
of your Dataproc Metastore service.
WAREHOUSE_DIR : The location of your Hive warehouse directory .
Option 2: Update the hive-site.xml file
You can also attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster by directly modifying the
cluster's hive-site.xml file.
Connect to the .*-m cluster using SSH .
Open the /etc/hive/conf/hive-site.xml file and modify the following lines:
< property >
< name>hive . metastore . uris < / name >
< ! -- Update this value . -- >
< value> ENDPOINT_URI < / value >
< / property >
< ! -- Add this property entry . -- >
< property >
< name>hive . metastore . warehouse . dir < / name >
< value> WAREHOUSE_DIR < / value >
< / property >
Replace the following:
ENDPOINT_URI : The endpoint URI
of your Dataproc Metastore service.
WAREHOUSE_DIR : The location of your
Hive warehouse directory .
Restart HiveServer2:
sudo systemctl restart hive-server2.service
Self-managed clusters
A self-managed cluster can be an Apache Hive instance,
an Apache Spark instance,
or a Presto cluster.
Attach a self-managed cluster
Set the following values in your client configuration file:
hive.metastore.uris= ENDPOINT_URI
hive.metastore.warehouse.dir= WAREHOUSE_DIR
Replace the following:
ENDPOINT_URI : The endpoint URI
of your Dataproc Metastore service.
WAREHOUSE_DIR : The location of your
Hive warehouse directory .
