Troubleshooting
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains various error scenarios and troubleshooting steps to resolve
the errors.
Connectivity and networking error scenarios
If your service experiences connectivity or networking issues, check the
scenarios in the following sections to see if one of them is causing the
problem.
Service creation fails due to constraint to restrict VPC peering
Don't set the org-policy constraint to restrict VPC peering. Specifying
constraints/compute.restrictVpcPeering causes your creation request to
fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error. If you must set the constraint, use the
following command to allow under:folders/270204312590 :
gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow compute.restrictVpcPeering under:folders/270204312590 --organization ORGANIZATION_ID
For more information, see Organization policy constraints .
Cross-project deployment fails where service account may not exist
To create a Dataproc Metastore service that is accessible in a network belonging
to a different project than the one the service belongs to, you must grant
roles/metastore.serviceAgent to the service project's
Dataproc Metastore service agent
( service- SERVICE_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-metastore.iam.gserviceaccount.com )
in the network project's IAM policy.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding NETWORK_PROJECT_ID \
--role "roles/metastore.serviceAgent" \
--member "serviceAccount:service- SERVICE_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-metastore.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
Caution: This IAM policy change indirectly allows Dataproc Metastore
users with metastore.services.create permission in the service project to
control the addresses and peerings in the network project. Note: If you have never created a Dataproc Metastore service in
the service project, then the gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding command
may fail with an error message containing Service account [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME] does
not exist. If this happens, you can resolve the issue by attempting to
create a service using a non-existent network in the service project. The
service creation will fail, but it will trigger the creation of the service
account. Afterwards, the command should succeed.
For more information, see Set up a cross-project deployment .
Private IP is required for network connectivity
Dataproc Metastore uses private IP only, so no public IP is
exposed. This means that only VMs on the provided Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network
or on-premises (connected through Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect )
can access the Dataproc Metastore service.
For more information, see Service access .
Required ingress-allow firewall rule for Kerberos
Kerberos requires Dataproc Metastore to initiate connections to
hosts in your project network. You must create a firewall rule that allows TCP
and UDP ingress on all ports from the /17 IP block that contains the
Dataproc Metastore IP.
For more information, see Firewall rules on your KDC
and Firewall rules for your services .
Connection error caused by resources provisioned in Shared VPC networks
If your Dataproc Metastore. If that happens,
Dataproc Metastore will attempt to reserve private IP address
ranges outside of the RFC 1918 ranges for service creation. For a list of
supported non-RFC 1918 private ranges, see Valid ranges
in the VPC network documentation.} service uses a network belonging to a
different project, and Compute Engine is protected by the service
perimeter, then the metastore project and network project must be in the same
perimeter.
To add existing Dataproc Metastore projects to the perimeter,
follow the instructions in Updating a service perimeter .
For more information, see VPC Service Controls with Dataproc Metastore .
Allocated IP range is exhausted
The provided VPC network may run out of available RFC 1918 addresses required by
Dataproc Metastore services. If that happens,
Dataproc Metastore will attempt to reserve private IP address
ranges outside of the RFC 1918 ranges for service creation. For a list of
supported non-RFC 1918 private ranges, see Valid ranges
in the VPC network documentation.
Non-RFC 1918 private IP addresses used in Dataproc Metastore may
conflict with a range in an on-premises network that is connected to the
provided VPC network. To check the list of RFC 1918 and non-RFC 1918 private IP
addresses reserved by Dataproc Metastore:
gcloud compute addresses list \
--project NETWORK_PROJECT_ID \
--filter = "purpose:VPC_PEERING AND name ~ cluster|resourcegroup"
If a conflict is determined and cannot be mitigated by re-configuring the
on-premises network, delete the offending Dataproc Metastore
service and re-create it again after 2 hours.
For more information, see IP address range exhaustion .
Operation timeout error scenarios
The following error scenarios result in an unresponsive service or operation
timeouts.
Use Audit logs to troubleshoot operation timeouts
To troubleshoot service operation timeouts, use the Logs Explorer in the
Google Cloud console to retrieve your audit log entries for your Cloud project.
In the Query builder pane, select Audited Resource or audited_resource as
the Google Cloud resource type, followed by Dataproc Metastore or
metastore.googleapis.com as the service. Selecting a method is optional.
For more information, see Viewing logs .
Service Unavailability
Dataproc Metastore services can become unavailable for various
reasons and cause failures. Common reasons this might occur include high CPU
usage or out of memory errors.
The issue can be caused by high load or many tables and partitions being
queried. To prevent this issue, we recommend using the Enterprise tier, which
provides flexible scalability, fault tolerance, and multi-zone high availability
while handling heavy workloads.
To troubleshoot out of memory errors, use the Logs Explorer in the
Google Cloud console to retrieve your audit log entries for your Cloud
project.
In the Logs Explorer, click Query builder .
Select the following filters
Resource type: metastore.googleapis.com/Services
Severity: ERROR
Keyword: OutofMemoryError
For more information, see Viewing
logs .
Import and export error scenarios
This section outlines common Dataproc Metastore import and export issues.
Import fails because the Hive versions don't match
When you import metadata, the Hive metastore and Dataproc Metastore
versions must be compatible. Your import may fail if the two don't match.
For more information on compatibility, see version policy .
You can check Cloud Logging to see if you encountered this error. The following message
is an example of this error.
Metastore schema version is not compatible. Hive Version: 3.1.0, Database Schema Version: 2.3.0
Note: You can use MySQL upgrade scripts to import metadata from a lower Hive metastore version to a higher version. To do this, import the dump into a MySQL instance and run the upgrade scripts.
Import fails because there are missing Hive table files
When preparing the import for Avro, there should be a file for each Hive table,
even if the table is empty, otherwise the import will fail.
You can use the Dataproc Metastore Toolkit
as a reference to check the correct Hive metadata schemas.
Service agent or user doesn't have necessary permissions
The Dataproc Metastore service agent ( service- CUSTOMER_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-metastore.iam.gserviceaccount.com )
and the user importing the metadata must have the following read permission to
the Cloud Storage bucket used for the import:
For MySQL, they must have storage.objects.get permission on the
Cloud Storage object (SQL dump file) used for the import.
For Avro, they must have storage.objects.get permission on the
Cloud Storage bucket used for the import.
For exports, the Dataproc Metastore service agent
( service- CUSTOMER_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-metastore.iam.gserviceaccount.com )
and the user creating the export must have storage.objects.create
permission on the bucket.
Job fails because the database file is too big
If your database file is too large, it can take more than the job timeout limit
to complete the import or export process. If the import is not able to complete within the 3 hour job timeout limit , you can split your metadata across multiple Dataproc Metastore instances.
Backup and restore error scenarios
This section outlines common Dataproc Metastore backup and restore issues.
Unable to create a new backup for a service
If there are already 7 backups in a service, then you must first manually
delete a backup before creating a new one. You can delete existing backups
from the Backup/Restore tab.
User doesn't have necessary permissions
To backup metadata, you must request an IAM role containing the
metastore.backups.create IAM permission.
To restore metadata, you must request an IAM role containing the
metastore.services.restore and metastore.backups.use IAM permissions.
Job fails because the service metadata file is too big
If your service metadata file
is too large, it can take more than the one hour job timeout limit
to complete the backup or restore process.
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster error scenarios
The following sections outline common Managed Service for Apache Spark and self-managed
cluster issues.
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster attachment fails due to mismatched versions
When you attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, the Managed Service for Apache Spark
image and Dataproc Metastore Hive version must be compatible.
Check the following image versioning pages to ensure that the Hive version is
compatible:
Managed Service for Apache Spark 2.0.x release versions
Managed Service for Apache Spark 1.5.x release versions
Managed Service for Apache Spark 1.4.x release versions
For more information, see Managed Service for Apache Spark Image version list .
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster creation fails due to insufficient roles
When creating a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, the cluster creation fails with the following error message:
gcloud.dataproc.clusters.create) INVALID_ARGUMENT: Default Service Account '**********-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com' is missing required permissions: [dataproc.agents.create, dataproc.agents.delete, dataproc.agents.get, dataproc.agents.update, dataproc.tasks.lease, dataproc.tasks.listInvalidatedLeases, dataproc.tasks.reportStatus]. Service Accounts must have either 'Dataproc/Dataproc Worker' role or all permissions granted by the role.
This can occur when you try to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
and attach it to your Dataproc Metastore.
To fix this issue, grant the roles/dataproc.worker to your service account.
The following example illustrates how to do this, using some sample values.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my_project \
--member=219315-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
--role=roles/dataproc.worker
Connection to metastore fails due to time zone issues
Your Hive file returns the error The server time zone value 'CDT' is
unrecognized or represents more than one time zone .
If you can't connect to your metastore from Managed Service for Apache Spark, then you
must delete your current cluster
and update your gcloud dataproc clusters create command or automation tool to
include the following time zone parameter:
--metadata "hive-metastore-uri=jdbc:mysql://10.207.26.77:3306/hive_metastore?serverTimezone=CST6CDT"
Troubleshooting Google Cloud CLI issues
If you encounter an issue where a gcloud CLI command is unavailable,
or if the command behaves differently from how it is documented, try updating
the gcloud CLI:
gcloud components update
