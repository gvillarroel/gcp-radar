Create a Dataproc Metastore service
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to create a Dataproc Metastore service.
After you create your Dataproc Metastore service, you can import
metadata and connect to any of the following services:
A Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster .
A self-managed Apache Hive
instance, Apache Spark instance,
or a Presto cluster.
After you connect one of these services, it uses your
Dataproc Metastore service as its Hive metastore during query
execution.
Note: It can take over 20 minutes to create a Dataproc Metastore
service. Creating additional services in the same project, region, and VPC
network can take less than 10 minutes.
Before you begin
Understand the differences between a Dataproc Metastore 1 service
and a Dataproc Metastore 2 service .
Enable
Dataproc Metastore
in your project.
Understand networking
requirements specific to your
project.
Required Roles
To get the permission that
you need to create a Dataproc Metastore,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on your project, based on the principle of least privilege:
Grant full control of Dataproc Metastore resources ( roles/metastore.editor )
Grant full access to all Dataproc Metastore resources, including IAM policy administration ( roles/metastore.admin )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains the
metastore.services.create
permission,
which is required to
create a Dataproc Metastore.
You might also be able to get
this permission
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
For more information about specific Dataproc Metastore roles and permissions, see Manage access with Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

Set a Hive metastore config override for Dataproc Metastore
If your Apache Hive warehouse directory is on Cloud Storage, you should set a
metastore config override. This override sets your custom data warehouse as the
default warehouse directory for your Dataproc Metastore service.
Before you set this override, make sure that your Dataproc Metastore
service has object read and write permissions to access the warehouse directory.
For more information, see Hive warehouse directory .
The following instructions show you how to set a Hive Metastore config override
for a new Dataproc Metastore service.
The following instructions show you how to set a Hive metastore config override
for a new Dataproc Metastore service.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the Dataproc Metastore page:
Open Dataproc Metastore
In the navigation bar, click +Create .
In the Metastore config overrides , enter the following values:
Key : hive.metastore.warehouse.dir .
Value : The Cloud Storage location of your warehouse directory.
For example: gs://my-bucket/path/to/location .
Configure the remaining service options as necessary, or use the
provided defaults.
Click Submit .
Return to the Dataproc Metastore page, and
verify that your service was successfully created.
gcloud CLI
To create a Dataproc Metastore service with a Hive override,
run the following gcloud metastore services create
command:
gcloud metastore services create SERVICE \
--location= LOCATION \
--hive-metastore-configs="hive.metastore.warehouse.dir= CUSTOMER_DIR "
Replace the following:
SERVICE : The name of your new
Dataproc Metastore service.
LOCATION : The Google Cloud region that you want
to create your Dataproc Metastore in. You can also set a
default location .
CUSTOMER_DIR : The Cloud Storage location of
your warehouse directory. For example: gs://my-bucket/path/to/location .
Verify that the creation was successful.
Create Dataproc Metastore with autoscaling
Dataproc Metastore 2 supports autoscaling. If you turn on autoscaling,
you can set a minimum scaling factor and a maximum scaling factor. After this is
set, your service automatically increases or decreases the scaling factor
required to run your workloads.
Autoscaling considerations
Autoscaling and scaling factors are mutually exclusive options. For example,
if you turn on autoscaling, you can't manually set a scaling factor or size.
Autoscaling is only available for single region Dataproc Metastore
instances.
When autoscaling is enabled, existing scaling factors settings are cleared.
When autoscaling is disabled:
Existing autoscaling settings are cleared.
The scaling factor is set to the last autoscaling_factor that was configured
on the service.
The minimum and maximum autoscaling factors are optional. If not set, the
default values are 0.1 and 6 , respectively.
Choose one of the following tabs to learn how to create a Dataproc Metastore
service 2 with autoscaling enabled.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Dataproc Metastore
page.
Go to
Dataproc Metastore
In the navigation bar, click +Create .
The Create metastore service dialog opens.
Select Dataproc Metastore 2 .
In the Pricing and Capacity section, select Enterprise - Single region
Under Instance Size , click Enable autoscaling .
Under Instance Size , use the slider to choose a minimum and maximum instance
size.
To create and start the service, click Submit .
Your new metastore service appears on the Dataproc Metastore
page. The status displays Creating until the service is ready to use.
When it's ready, the status changes to Active .
Provisioning the service might take a few minutes.
REST
Note: The following command assumes that you've logged in to the gcloud CLI with
your user account. You can sign in by executing gcloud init
or gcloud auth login ,
or by using Cloud Shell , which
automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI. You can check the active
account by executing gcloud auth list .
curl -X POST -s -i -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-d '{"scaling_config":{"autoscaling_config":{"autoscaling_enabled": true,"limit_config":{"max_scaling_factor": MAX_SCALING_FACTOR ,"min_scaling_factor": MIN_SCALING_FACTOR }}}}' \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
https://metastore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/services?service_id= SERVICE_ID
Replace the following:
MIN_INSTANCES Optional: The minimum number of instances
to use in your autoscaling configuration. If this values are not specified,
a default value of 0.1 is used.
MAX_INSTANCES Optional: The maximum number of instances
to use in your autoscaling configuration. If this values are not specified,
a default value of 6 is used.
Create a Dataproc Metastore service using Shared VPC
A Shared VPC lets you connect Dataproc Metastore
resources from multiple projects to a common VPC network.
To create a Dataproc Metastore service configured with a
Shared VPC, see Create a service using advanced settings .
Considerations
VPC networks are not relevant for Dataproc Metastore services
configured with the gRPC endpoint protocol.
For Dataproc Metastore services configured with the Thrift endpoint
protocol, make sure your Dataproc Metastore service and the
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster it's attached to are using the same Shared VPC
network.
For Dataproc Metastore services configured with the Thrift endpoint
protocol and Private Service Connect, make sure that you use subnetworks
from the Shared VPC network.
IAM roles required for Shared VPC networks
To create a Dataproc Metastore service with a VPC that is accessible
in a network belonging to a different project,
you must grant roles/metastore.serviceAgent to the service project's
Dataproc Metastore service agent
( service- SERVICE_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-metastore.iam.gserviceaccount.com )
in the network project's IAM policy.
Caution: This IAM policy change grants Dataproc Metastore
users with the metastore.services.create permission in the service project to
indirectly create addresses and peerings in the network project.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding NETWORK_PROJECT_ID \
--role "roles/metastore.serviceAgent" \
--member "serviceAccount:service- SERVICE_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-metastore.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
Note: If you have never created a Dataproc Metastore service in
the service project, then the gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding command
might fail with an error message containing Service account [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME] does not exist.
If this happens, you can resolve the issue by attempting to
create a service using a non-existent network in the service project. The
service creation will fail, but it will trigger the creation of the service
account. Afterwards, the command should succeed.
Troubleshoot common issues
Some common issues include the following:
Restricting VPC peering . Before creating a metastore, don't set an
org policy constraint to restrict VPC peering or else the metastore creation
fails. For more information about setting the correct VPC configurations,
see Service creation fails due to constraint to restrict VPC
peering .
Issues with VPC networks . When creating a metastore, the VPC network you
are using might run out of available RFC 1918 addresses required by
Dataproc Metastore services. For more information about
fixing this issue, see Allocated IP range is
exhausted .
