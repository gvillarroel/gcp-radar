Dataproc Metastore core concepts
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Use the following concepts to help you understand how
Dataproc Metastore works and the different features you can use
with your service.
Dataproc Metastore versions
When you create a Dataproc Metastore service, you can choose to use
a Dataproc Metastore 2 service or a Dataproc Metastore 1
service .
Dataproc Metastore 2
Dataproc Metastore 2 uses a scaling factor to determine how
many resources your service uses at a given time. After you create a
Dataproc Metastore 2, you can scale the service up or down by modifying
the scaling factor.
Dataproc Metastore 2 is the new generation of the service that offers
horizontal scalability in addition to Dataproc Metastore features.
For more information, see features and benefits .
Dataproc Metastore 2 has a different pricing plan than
Dataproc Metastore. For more information, see pricing plans and scaling configurations .
Dataproc Metastore 1
Dataproc Metastore 1 uses service tiers to determine how many
resources your service uses at a given time. Service tiers provide a predictable,
predetermined amount of resources.
Check your Dataproc Metastore version
You can check what version of Dataproc Metastore you're using in the
Google Cloud console.
Dataproc Metastore 2 : The configuration table contains the
following value: Edition Enterprise - Single Region .
Dataproc Metastore 1 : The configuration table contains one of the
following values: Tier: DEVELOPER or Tier: ENTERPRISE .
Common Dataproc Metastore terms
The following terms are used commonly throughout the Dataproc Metastore
ecosystem and documentation.
Services
Apache Hive . Hive is a popular open source data warehouse system built
on Apache Hadoop. Hive offers a SQL-like query language called HiveQL, which
is used to analyze large, structured datasets.
Apache Hive metastore . The Hive metastore holds metadata about Hive
tables, such as their schema and location.
Managed Service for Apache Spark . Managed Service for Apache Spark is a fast, easy-to-use, fully
managed service on Google Cloud for running Apache Spark and Apache
Hadoop workloads in a simple, cost-efficient way. After you create a
Dataproc Metastore, you can connect to it from a
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster . After you create a
Dataproc Metastore service, you can connect to it from a
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster. You can also use Dataproc Metastore
with various other clusters, such as self-managed Apache Hive, Apache Spark,
or Presto clusters.
Dataproc Metastore service . The name of the metastore
instance you create in Google Cloud. You can have one or many different
metastore services in your implementation.
Private Service Connect . Private Service Connect lets you set
up a private connection to Dataproc Metastore metadata across
VPC networks. You can use it for networking as an alternative to VPC
peering.
VPC Service Controls . VPC Service Controls improves your ability to mitigate
the risk of data exfiltration from Google Cloud services by allowing you to
create perimeters that protect the resources and data of services that you
explicitly specify.
Concepts
Tables . All Hive applications have managed internal or unmanaged
external tables that store your data.
Hive warehouse directory . The default location where managed table data
is stored.
Artifacts bucket . A Cloud Storage bucket that is created in your
project automatically with every metastore service that you create. This
bucket can be used to store your service artifacts, such as exported
metadata and managed table data. By default, the artifacts bucket stores the
default warehouse directory of your Dataproc Metastore
service.
Endpoints . A Dataproc Metastore service provides clients
access to the stored Hive Metastore metadata through one or more network
endpoints. Dataproc Metastore provides URIs for
these endpoints.
Endpoint protocols . The over-the-wire network protocol used for
communication between Dataproc Metastore and Hive Metastore
clients. Dataproc Metastore supports Apache Thrift and
gRPC endpoints.
Metadata Federation . A feature that lets you access metadata that is
stored in multiple Dataproc Metastore instances.
Auxiliary versions . A feature that lets you connect multiple Hive client
versions to the same Dataproc Metastore service.
Hive metastore concepts
Using a Dataproc Metastore service requires that you understand
basic Hive metastore concepts. For more information, see Hive Metastore .
Network Requirements
The Dataproc Metastore service requires networking access to work
correctly. For more information, see Configure network requirements .
Project configurations
There are a number of possible project configurations you can use when deploying a
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster and a Dataproc Metastore service.
For more information, see cross-project deployment .
