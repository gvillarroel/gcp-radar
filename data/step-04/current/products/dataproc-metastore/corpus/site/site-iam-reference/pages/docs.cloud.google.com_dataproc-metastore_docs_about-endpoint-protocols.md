About Dataproc Metastore endpoint protocols
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
When you create a Dataproc Metastore service, you must choose to use
one of the following endpoint protocols:
The Apache Thrift protocol
The gRPC protocol
This protocol defines how your Hive Metastore clients access metadata stored in
your Dataproc Metastore service. This choice can also affect the
features that you can integrate and use with your service.
This page explains the conceptual differences between each of the endpoint
protocols.
Apache Thrift
The Apache Thrift protocol is the
legacy default option that is preselected when you create a
Dataproc Metastore service.
The Thrift protocol supports Kerberos only for single-region services configured
with VPC peering. It does not support Kerberos for any services configured with Private Service Connect.
If you require Kerberos, we recommend using the gRPC protocol instead. The gRPC
protocol supports Kerberos for single-region services with all networking configurations.
If you use a Thrift endpoint, you can choose the port number that the Thrift
interface connects to. By default, port number 9083 is used.
After choosing the Thrift protocol
After you create a Dataproc Metastore using Thrift, you can connect to
it from a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster or self-managed
cluster . Your cluster then uses
Dataproc Metastore as its Hive metastore.
gRPC
The gRPC protocol is the modern, portable, high
performance option that you must explicitly select when you create a
Dataproc Metastore service.
If you choose the gRPC protocol, you can't update it to Thrift at a later date.
If you want to move from gRPC to Thrift, you must create a new
Dataproc Metastore.
If you use a gRPC endpoint, you can't choose the port number that the gRPC
interface uses. Instead, port number 443 is automatically assigned to your
interface.
Tip: We recommend that you use the gRPC protocol because it provides additional
security through Identity and Access Management (IAM) (IAM). It also supports federation integrations
with other Google Cloud products.
After choosing the gRPC protocol
After you create a Dataproc Metastore using the gRPC endpoint protocol,
you must grant additional IAM roles .
After, you can connect to it from a Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster . Your cluster then uses
Dataproc Metastore as its Hive metastore.
