Setting up the Groups API
This page explains how to set up the Cloud Identity Groups API.
Note: To use the Groups API, you must have Google Groups for Business
enabled for your domain and allow end users to create groups. See
Turn Groups for Business ON or OFF
and
Set Groups for Business sharing options
for more information. These steps require Google Workspace administrator access
to your domain.
Before you begin
Enable the Cloud Identity API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Installing the client libraries
To install the client libraries, run the following command:
Python
For more on setting up your Python development environment, refer to the
Python Development Environment Setup Guide .
pip install -- upgrade google - api - python - client google - auth \
google - auth - oauthlib google - auth - httplib2
Authenticating with the Groups API
You can authenticate with the Groups API as an end user, as a service
account group admin without domain-wide delegation, or as a service account
with domain-wide delegation. The following sections describe each method.
Authenticating as an end user
If you're not an administrator, or are building an app that acts on behalf of
users who aren't administrators, see
Using OAuth 2.0 for web server applications ,
and then see the Instantiating a client section below.
Authenticating as a service account without domain-wide delegation
If you're using a service account and want to use it to manage groups as a
group admin, complete the steps below. This authentication method should be used
when you want the service account's actions to be registered in the audit logs
as the service account.
Assigning an admin role to the service account
Tip: If the service account doesn't need access to all of the groups, consider
making it an owner of the groups of interest. You don't need to assign the
group admin role in this case.
First, you should assign the Google Workspace Group Administrator Role (Group
Administrator) to the service account you want to delegate to, using the Admin
SDK Roles and Role Assignments API. This step gives the service account access
to the groups of the domain but no other resource.
Note: You must have Google Workspace Super Admin access for your domain to make
the service account a delegated admin.
See the
Managing Roles guide
for general information about managing Roles using the Admin SDK API. Follow
the steps below to assign the Group Adminstrator role for your service account.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page:
Go to Service Accounts
Click the name of the service account that you want to use with the
Groups API.
Copy the Unique ID of the service account.
Call the Admin SDK Roles API to identify the roleId for Group
Administrator. You can use the
API Explorer
in the Admin SDK documentation to do this.
Call the
Role Assignments API
with the following request body:
{
"assignedTo" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_ID "
"roleId" : " ROLE_ID "
"scopeType" : "CUSTOMER"
"kind" : "admin#directory#roleAssignment"
}
Authenticating and authorizing the service account
You now have a service account with the Group Administrator role. The second
step is to complete the OAuth authentication process for the service account.
If you are developing an app on Google Cloud and the service account
is an owner of the project, you can use the application default credentials
instead, which can simplify the process. See
Authenticating as a Service Account
for more information.
If the service account is not the owner of the project, follow the instructions
below.
In either case, the applicable scope for the Cloud Identity Groups API is
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups .
Using the credential you just created, generate an access token.
Note: Do not impersonate a user when generating credentials. Skip fields
such as with_subject , createDelegated , or setServiceAccountUser .
Java
GoogleCredential credential = new GoogleCredential . Builder ()
. setTransport ( httpTransport )
. setJsonFactory ( JSON_FACTORY )
. setServiceAccountId ( emailAddress )
. setServiceAccountPrivateKeyFromP12File ( new File ( "MyProject.p12" ))
. setServiceAccountScopes ( ImmutableList . of ( "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups" ))
. build ();
Keep the access token that's generated.

. setClock ( credential . getClock ());
credential = builder . build ();
if ( ! credential . refreshToken ()) {
throw new Exception ( "Failed to fetch access token." );
}
return credential . getAccessToken ();
}

] ,
)
Testing the service account
Try any Groups API call with the service
account credentials: create a group, add users, update group settings, etc.
Check the Audit Logs in the Google Admin Console Reports section. You should
see the service account as the actor for your group-related changes. See
Log events for more
information.
Alternatively, you can use APIs to access audit logs. To check using the
Reports API explorer ,
make sure to use your admin OAuth credentials.
Authenticating as a service account with domain-wide delegation
If you're an administrator managing identity groups, or if you want to provide
an account with domain-wide privileges so it can manage Google Groups on behalf
of admins, you should authenticate as a
service account .
Note: Because domain-wide delegation works by allowing the service account to
impersonate an admin user, audit logs will show any service account actions as
the user. If you want the actions to show up as the service account, see
Authenticating as a service account without domain-wide-delegation
above.
For details about setting up domain-wide delegation, see
Control API access with domain-wide delegation .
To authenticate as a service account, refer to
Using OAuth 2.0 for server to server applications .
When initializing the credential in your code, specify the email address on
which the service account acts by calling with_subject() on the credential.
For example:
Python
credentials = service_account . Credentials . from_service_account_file (
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE , scopes = SCOPES ) . with_subject ( delegated_email )
Instantiating a client
The following example shows how to instantiate a client using service account
credentials. To authenticate as an end-user instead, replace the credential
object from the service account with the credential you
obtained earlier in
Using OAuth 2.0 for web server applications .
Python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import googleapiclient.discovery
SCOPES = [ 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups' ]
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = '/path/to/service-account-file.json'
def create_service ():
credentials = service_account . Credentials . from_service_account_file (
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE , scopes = SCOPES )
delegated_credentials = credentials . with_subject ( 'user@example.org' )
service_name = 'cloudidentity'
api_version = 'v1'
service = googleapiclient . discovery . build (
service_name ,
api_version ,
credentials = delegated_credentials )
return service
You can now begin making calls to the Groups API.
