Best practices for using service accounts in pipelines
Stay organized with collections

Deployment pipelines let you automate the process of taking code or pre-built
artifacts and deploying them to a Google Cloud environment, and they can be an
alternative to using interactive tools like the Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI.
Deployment pipelines differ from interactive tools like the Google Cloud console
or the gcloud CLI in the way they interact with Identity and Access Management, and you
must take these differences into consideration when securing your Google Cloud
resources.
Before Google Cloud lets you access a resource, it performs an access check.
To perform this check, IAM typically considers:
Your identity and any associated principal access boundary policies
The resource you're trying to access and its IAM allow and deny policies
The context of your request (possibly including time and location)
In a deployment pipeline, you rarely call Google Cloud APIs directly. Instead, you use
tools to access Google Cloud resources. Tools like the Google Cloud console
or the gcloud CLI require that you first authorize the tool to access
resources on your behalf. By providing this authorization, you give the tool
permission to use your identity when making API calls.
Like the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI, a deployment pipeline
acts on your behalf : it takes your changes, expressed as source code, and deploys
them to Google Cloud. But unlike the Google Cloud console or the
gcloud CLI, a deployment pipeline typically doesn't use your identity
to perform the deployment:
As a user, you typically don't interact with a deployment pipeline directly.
Instead, you interact with a source control system (SCM) by pushing code changes
to a source repository, or approving code reviews.
The deployment pipeline reads submitted code changes from the SCM system and
deploys them to Google Cloud.
To perform the deployment, the deployment pipeline typically can't use your
identity because:
The source code and its metadata might not indicate that you were the
author, or the author information isn't tamper-proof (as in the case of
unsigned Git commits)
The identity you used to submit source code might be different from your
identity for Google Cloud, and the two identities can't be mapped
Most deployment pipelines therefore perform deployments under their own identity
by using a service account.
When the deployment pipeline accesses Google Cloud, IAM
allows or denies access solely based on the identity of the service account used
by the pipeline, not the identity of your user account.
Letting a deployment pipeline use a service account to access Google Cloud
has some advantages:
The lifecycle of a service account is disconnected from the lifecycle of user
accounts. By configuring a pipeline to use a service account, you ensure that
code can be deployed even if the author of the code is no longer with your
organization.
When you manage resources by using a deployment pipeline, you don't need to
grant users any access to the resources, or you can limit permissions to
read-only access. This approach can make it easier to manage
IAM allow and deny policies and lets you force users to use
the deployment pipeline to perform all modifications.
However, using a service account also introduces new threats. These include:
Spoofing: A bad actor could try to spoof the identity of the deployment
pipeline or steal its credentials to gain access to resources.
Privilege escalation : The pipeline could be tricked into performing
actions that it's not supposed to perform, effectively becoming a
confused deputy .
Non-repudiation: After a pipeline has performed an operation, it might
become difficult to reconstruct why it was done, and which developer or
code change it was triggered by.
Tampering: A pipeline could be abused for undermining the integrity or
security controls of your cloud environments.
Information disclosure: Bad actors might attempt to use the deployment
pipeline for exfiltrating confidential data.
Protect against spoofing threats
To grant a deployment pipeline access to Google Cloud, you typically do
the following:
Create a service account
Grant the service account access to the required resources
Configure the deployment pipeline to use the service account
From an IAM perspective, the service account represents the deployment pipeline,
but the deployment pipeline and the service account are two separate entities.
If not secured properly, a bad actor might be able to use the same service account,
which lets them "spoof" the identity of the deployment pipeline.
The following section describes best practices that can help you reduce the risk of such threats.
Best practices :
Avoid attaching service accounts to VM instances used by CI/CD systems .
Use dedicated service accounts per deployment pipeline .
Use Workload Identity Federation whenever possible .
Use VPC Service Controls to reduce the impact of leaked credentials .
Avoid attaching service accounts to VM instances used by CI/CD systems
For applications deployed on Compute Engine that need access to Google Cloud
resources, it's typically best to attach a service account to the underlying VM instance . For
CI/CD systems that use Compute Engine VMs to run different deployment pipelines,
this practice can be problematic if the same VM instance might be used to run different
deployment pipelines that each require access to different resources.
Instead of using attached service accounts to let deployment pipelines access
resources, let each deployment pipeline use a separate service account .
Avoid attaching a service account
to VM instances used by CI/CD systems, or attach a service account that's limited
to accessing essential services such as Cloud Logging only.
Use dedicated service accounts per deployment pipeline
When you let multiple deployment pipelines use the same service account, IAM
can't differentiate between the pipelines. The pipelines have access to the same
resources, and audit logs might not contain sufficient information to determine
which deployment pipeline triggered a resource to be accessed or changed.
To avoid such ambiguity, maintain a 1:1 relationship between deployment pipelines
and service accounts. Create a dedicated service account for each deployment
pipeline and make sure to do the following:
Incorporate the name or ID of the deployment pipeline into the service account's
email address. Following a consistent naming scheme helps you determine which
service accounts are connected to which deployment pipelines.
Only grant the service account access to the resources the specific
deployment pipeline needs.
Use Workload Identity Federation whenever possible
Some CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions or GitLab let deployment pipelines obtain
OpenID Connect-compliant tokens that assert the identity of the deployment pipeline.
You can let deployment pipelines use these tokens to impersonate a service account
by using Workload Identity Federation .
Using Workload Identity Federation helps you avoid the risks associated with using service account keys .
Use VPC Service Controls to reduce the impact of leaked credentials
If a bad actor manages to steal an access token or service account key from one
of your deployment pipelines, they might attempt to use this credential and
access your resources from a different machine that they control.
By default, IAM doesn't take the geolocation, source IP address,
or origin Google Cloud project into account when making access decisions.
A stolen credential might therefore be usable from anywhere.
You can impose restrictions on the sources from where your Google Cloud
resources can be accessed by placing your projects in a VPC service perimeter
and using ingress rules :
If your deployment pipeline runs on Google Cloud, you can configure an
ingress rule to only allow access from the project that contains your CI/CD system.
If your deployment pipeline runs outside of Google Cloud, you can create
an access level that
only permits access from certain geo-locations or IP ranges. Then create an
ingress rule that allows access for clients that satisfy this access level.
Note: Restricting access by IP range might be less effective or infeasible if
you're using a Software as a Service (SaaS)-based system to run your deployment
pipelines. This is because the source IP addresses used by SaaS providers may
not be known in advance, or they might be shared across all their customers.
Protect against tampering threats
For some data that you store on Google Cloud, you might find it particularly
important to prevent unauthorized modification or deletion. If unauthorized
modification or deletion is of particular concern, then you can characterize the
data as high-integrity data.
To maintain the integrity of your data, you must ensure that the Google Cloud
resources that you use to store and manage that data are configured securely, and
must maintain their integrity.
Deployment pipelines can help you maintain the integrity of your data and resources,
but they can also pose a risk: If the pipeline of one of its components
doesn't meet the integrity requirements of the resources it manages, then
the deployment pipeline turns into a weak spot that might enable bad actors to
tamper with your data or resources.
The following section describes best practices that can help you reduce the risk of tampering threats.
Best practices :
Avoid letting deployment pipelines manage security controls .
Limit access to security controls
To ensure the security and integrity of your data and resources on Google Cloud,
you use security controls such as:
Allow policies and deny policies
Organization policy constraints
VPC Service Controls perimeters, access levels, and ingress policies
These security controls are resources by themselves. Tampering with security controls
endangers the integrity of the resources that the security controls apply to.
As a result, you must consider the integrity of security controls to be at least
as important as the integrity of the resources they apply to.
If you let a deployment pipeline manage security controls, then it's up to the
deployment pipeline to maintain the integrity of security controls. As a result,
you must consider the integrity of the deployment pipeline itself to be at least
as important as the integrity of the security controls it manages, and the resources these controls apply to.
You can limit a deployment pipeline's impact on the integrity of your resources
by doing the following:
Not granting deployment pipelines access to allow policies, deny policies,
and other security controls, and restricting their access to other resources
Granting access to selected security controls only, such as the allow policies
and deny policies of a specific resource or project, while not granting access
to broader controls that affect multiple resources or projects
If your deployment pipeline, its components, and underlying infrastructure can't
meet the integrity demands of certain security controls, it's best to avoid
letting deployment pipelines manage these security controls.
Protect against non-repudiation threats
At some point, you might notice suspicious activity affecting one of your resources
on Google Cloud. In that event, you must be able to find out more about the
activity and, ideally, be able to reconstruct the chain of events that led to it.
Cloud Audit Logs let you find out when resources were accessed or modified, and
which users were involved. Although Cloud Audit Logs provide a starting point
for analyzing suspicious activity, the information provided by these logs might
not be sufficient: if you use deployment pipelines, you must also be able to
correlate Cloud Audit Logs with logs produced by your deployment pipeline.
This section contains best practices that can help you maintain an audit trail
across Google Cloud and your deployment pipelines.
Best practices :
Ensure that you can correlate deployment pipeline logs with Cloud Audit Logs .
Align the retention periods of deployment pipeline logs and Cloud Audit Logs .
Ensure that you can correlate deployment pipeline logs with Cloud Audit Logs
Cloud Audit Logs contain timestamps and information about the user that initiated
an activity. If you use a dedicated service account for each deployment pipeline , then this information lets you identify the
deployment pipeline that initiated the activity and might also help you narrow
down which code changes and pipeline runs could have been responsible. But
identifying the exact pipeline run and code change that led to the activity can
be difficult without more information that lets you correlate Cloud Audit Logs
with the logs of your deployment pipeline.
You can enrich Cloud Audit Logs to contain more information in multiple ways, including:
When you use Terraform, specify a request reason
that indicates CI/CD pipeline run.
Add an X-Goog-Request-Reason HTTP header
to API requests and pass the ID of the deployment pipeline run.
Use a custom User-Agent that embeds the ID of the deployment pipeline run.
You can also enrich the logs emitted by your deployment pipeline:
Log API requests performed by each CI/CD pipeline run.
Whenever the API returns an operation ID, record the ID in the CI/CD system's logs.
Align the retention periods of deployment pipeline logs and Cloud Audit Logs
To analyze suspicious activity related to a deployment pipeline, you typically
need multiple types of logs, including Admin Activity audit logs ,
Data Access audit logs , and the logs of your
deployment pipeline.
Cloud Logging only retains logs for a certain period of time. By default,
this retention period is shorter for Data Access audit logs
than for Admin Activity audit logs. The system that runs your deployment pipeline
might also discard its logs after a certain time period. Depending on the nature
of your deployment pipeline, and the importance of the resources that the
deployment pipeline manages, these default retention periods might be insufficient
or misaligned.
To ensure that logs are available when you need them, make sure that the log
retention periods used by the different systems are aligned and sufficiently long.
If necessary, customize the retention period
for Data Access audit logs, or set up a custom sink
to route logs to a custom storage location.
Best practices :
Avoid granting direct access to confidential data .
Use VPC Service Controls to help prevent data exfiltration .
Protect against information disclosure threats
When a deployment pipeline's service account has access to confidential data,
then a bad actor might attempt to use the deployment pipeline to exfiltrate
that data. A deployment pipeline's access to data can be direct or indirect:
Direct : The deployment pipeline's service account might have permission
to read confidential data from Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or other locations.
This access might have been granted intentionally, but it might also be an
accidental result of granting too much access.
If a bad actor gains access to a deployment pipeline with direct access to
confidential data, they might try to use the service account's access token
to access and exfiltrate the data.
Indirect : To deploy configuration or new software versions, a deployment
pipeline's service account might have permission to create or redeploy
compute resources, such as Compute Engine VM instances. Some of
these resources might have an attached service account that grants access to
confidential data.
In this situation, a bad actor might attempt to compromise the deployment
pipeline so that it deploys malicious code to one of the compute resources,
and let this code exfiltrate confidential data.
This section contains best practices that can help you limit the risk of disclosing confidential data.
Avoid granting direct access to confidential data
To deploy infrastructure, configuration, or new software versions, a deployment
pipeline often doesn't require access to existing data.
Instead, it's often sufficient to limit access to resources that don't contain
any data, or at least don't contain confidential data.
Ways to minimize access to existing, potentially confidential data include:
Instead of granting a deployment pipeline's service account access to an
entire project, only grant access to specific resources.
Grant create access without allowing read access. For example, by granting
the Storage Object Creator role ( roles/storage.objectCreator ), you can
allow a service account to upload new objects to a Cloud Storage bucket
without granting permission to read existing data.
Limit infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to less-confidential resources—for
example, use IaC for managing VM instances or networks, but not for managing
confidential BigQuery datasets.
Use VPC Service Controls to help prevent data exfiltration
You can reduce the risk of indirect data exfiltration by
deploying your Google Cloud resources in a VPC Service Controls perimeter .
If your deployment pipeline runs outside of Google Cloud, or is part of a
different perimeter, you can grant the pipeline's service account access to the
perimeter by configuring an ingress rule .
If possible, configure the ingress rule so that it only allows access from the
IP addresses used by the deployment pipeline, and only permits access to the
services that the deployment pipeline really needs.
Protect against privilege escalation threats
When a deployment pipeline uses a service account to access Google Cloud
resources, it does so irrespective of the developer or user who authored a code
or configuration change. The disconnect between the pipeline's service account
and the developer's identity makes deployment pipelines prone to
confused deputy attacks,
in which a bad actor tricks the pipeline into performing an action that the bad
actor isn't allowed to do themselves, and that the pipeline might not even be
supposed to perform.
This section contains best practices that can help you reduce the risk of your
deployment pipeline being abused for privilege escalation.
Best practices :
Limit access to the deployment pipeline and all inputs .
Avoid letting a deployment pipeline modify policies .
Don't reveal service account credentials in logs .
Limit access to the deployment pipeline and all inputs
Most deployment pipelines use a source code repository as their main source of
input and might trigger automatically as soon as they detect a code change in
certain branches (for example, the main branch). Deployment pipelines typically
can't verify whether the code and configuration they find in the source code
repository is authentic and trustworthy. The security of this architecture therefore
depends on:
Controlling who can submit code and configuration to the repository and branches
used by the deployment pipeline.
Enforcing criteria that must be met before changes can be committed—for example,
successful code reviews, static analysis, or automated tests.
For these controls to be effective, you must also ensure that bad actors can't sidestep them by:
Modifying the configuration of the source code repository or the deployment pipeline.
Tampering with the infrastructure (such as VMs and storage) that underlies the
deployment pipeline.
Modifying or replacing inputs outside of the source code repository, such as packages,
container images, or libraries.
When managed by a deployment pipeline, your resources on Google Cloud can
only be as secure as your deployment pipeline, its configuration, infrastructure,
and inputs. Therefore, you must protect these components as well as you want your
Google Cloud resources to be protected.
Avoid letting a deployment pipeline modify policies
For most types of resources, IAM defines a
RESOURCE_TYPE .setIamPolicy permission. This permission
enables a user to modify a resource's allow policy, either to grant other
users access or to modify and extend their own access. Unless constrained by a
deny policy, granting a user or service account a *.setIamPolicy
permission has the effect of granting them full access to the resource.
Whenever possible, avoid letting a deployment pipeline modify access to resources.
When granting the pipeline's service account access to Google Cloud resources,
use roles that don't include any *.setIamPolicy permission and avoid using the
basic roles Editor and Owner .
For some deployment pipelines, granting permission to modify allow policies or
deny policies might be unavoidable: For example, a deployment pipeline's purpose
might be to create new resources or manage access to existing resources. In these
scenarios, you can still limit the extent to which the deployment can modify access by:
Only granting *.setIamPolicy permission for specific resources, and not
for the entire project.
Using IAM deny policies to constrain the set of
permissions that can be granted, or to limit which principals they can be granted to.
Using IAM Conditions to restrict which roles the pipeline is allowed to grant , and only allowing roles that
don't include *.setIamPolicy permissions.
Don't reveal service account credentials in logs
The logs generated by a deployment pipeline are often accessible to a larger
group of users, including users that don't have permission to modify the
pipeline's configuration. It's possible that these logs accidentally reveal
credentials by echoing the following:
Contents of environment variables
Command line arguments
Diagnostics output
If logs accidentally reveal credentials such as access tokens, then these credentials
could be abused by bad actors to escalate their privileges. Ways to prevent logs
from revealing credentials include the following:
Avoid passing access tokens or other credentials as command line arguments
Avoid storing credentials in environment variables
Configure your CI/CD system to automatically detect and mask tokens and other credentials if possible
