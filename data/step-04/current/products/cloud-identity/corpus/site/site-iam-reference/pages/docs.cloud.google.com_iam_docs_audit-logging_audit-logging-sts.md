Stay organized with collections

This document describes audit logging for Security Token Service. Google Cloud services
generate audit logs that record administrative and access activities within your Google Cloud resources.
For more information about Cloud Audit Logs, see the following:
Types of audit logs
Audit log entry structure

Cloud Logging pricing summary
Enable Data Access audit logs
Service name
Security Token Service audit logs use the service name sts.googleapis.com .
Filter for this service:
protoPayload . serviceName = "sts.googleapis.com"
Methods by permission type
Each IAM permission has a type property, whose value is an enum
that can be one of four values: ADMIN_READ , ADMIN_WRITE ,
DATA_READ , or DATA_WRITE . When you call a method,
Security Token Service generates an audit log whose category is dependent on the
type property of the permission required to perform the method.
Methods that require an IAM permission with the type property value
of DATA_READ , DATA_WRITE , or ADMIN_READ generate
Data Access audit logs.
Methods that require an IAM permission with the type property value
of ADMIN_WRITE generate
Admin Activity audit logs.
API methods in the following list that are marked with (LRO) are long-running operations (LROs).
These methods usually generate two audit log entries: one when the operation starts and
another when it ends. For more information see Audit logs for long-running operations .
