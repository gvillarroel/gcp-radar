Service account credentials
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Like any principal, a service account can authenticate itself to Google, obtain
an OAuth 2.0 access token, and call Google APIs. However, this process works
differently for service accounts than for users.
Service accounts authenticate by doing one of the following:
Obtaining short-lived credentials
Using a service account key to sign a JSON Web Token (JWT) and
exchange it for an access token
Short-lived service account credentials
The most secure way to authenticate as a service account is to obtain
short-lived credentials for the service account in the form of an OAuth 2.0
access token. By default, these tokens expire after
1 hour.
Short-lived service account credentials are useful for scenarios where
you need to grant limited access to resources for trusted service accounts. They
also create less risk than long-lived credentials, such as service account keys.
In many cases, these credentials are obtained automatically—you don't need
to create or manage them yourself. Here are some examples:
If you run a Google Cloud CLI command, and you include the
--impersonate-service-account flag , then the
gcloud CLI creates short-lived credentials for the service account
and runs the command with those credentials.
If you attach a service account to a Compute Engine virtual
machine (VM) instance, then workloads on that instance can use the
Cloud Client Libraries to access Google Cloud services. The
Cloud Client Libraries use Application Default Credentials (ADC) to obtain
short-lived credentials for the service account.
For details about this process, see
Authenticating applications using service account credentials .
If you configured workload identity
federation , then the Cloud Client Libraries can
use credentials from your identity provider to generate short-lived service
account credentials.
You can also use the Service Account Credentials API to create short-lived
credentials manually . For example, you could create a
service that gives users short-lived service account credentials to let them
temporarily access Google Cloud resources.
The Service Account Credentials API can create the following types of
credentials:
OAuth 2.0 access tokens
OpenID Connect (OIDC) ID tokens
Self-signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
Self-signed binary blobs
For more information, see Creating short-lived service account
credentials .
Interpreting audit logs
Cloud Audit Logs help you answer the questions "who did what, where, and when?"
for your Google Cloud resources.
When you use short-lived credentials to impersonate a service account, most
Google Cloud services create log entries that show the following
identities:
The service account that the short-lived credentials are impersonating
The identity that created the short-lived credentials
You can use these log entries to identify the principal that created the
short-lived credentials, as well as the service account that the principal
impersonated.
Note: Some Google Cloud services, including App Engine and Google Kubernetes Engine, do not log
the identity that created the short-lived credentials.
For examples of audit log entries that show service account impersonation, see
Impersonating a service account to access Google Cloud .
Self-impersonation
Self-impersonation is when you use a service account's own credentials to
generate a new credential for the service account.
The Service Account Credentials API prohibits the following kinds
of self-impersonation:
Using a short-lived credential for a service account to generate a new access
token for the service account.
Self-signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are the exception to this
rule—you can use a self-signed JWT for a service account to generate a
new access token for the service account.
Using a short-lived credential for a service account to sign a binary object
(blob) or JWT that can be used to call the following APIs:
Identity and Access Management API
Service Account Credentials API
OAuth 2.0 API
Google Cloud prohibits this kind of self-impersonation because it lets
malicious actors refresh stolen tokens indefinitely.
If you try to use self-impersonation in one of the prohibited ways, you might
encounter the following error:
FAILED_PRECONDITION: You can't create a token for the same service account that
you used to authenticate the request.
If you encounter this error, try using different credentials to generate the new
short-lived credential for your service account—for example, your end-user
credentials or a different service account's credentials.
Service account keys
Each service account is associated with a public/private RSA key pair. The
Service Account Credentials API uses this internal key pair to create
short-lived service account credentials, and to sign blobs and JSON Web Tokens
(JWTs). This key pair is known as the
Google-owned and managed key pair .
In addition, you can create multiple public/private RSA key pairs, known as
user-managed key pairs , and use the private key to authenticate with Google
APIs. This private key is known as a service account key .
Always store your service account keys in a secure location. If you don't store your keys securely,
then bad actors can find the keys and use them to access the resources that the service account can
access. We strongly recommend storing your keys in a hardware-based or software-based key store. For
more guidance on storing service account keys securely, see Protecting
against privilege escalation .
Google-owned and managed key pairs
Google-owned and managed key pairs are used by the
Service Account Credentials API, and by Google Cloud services such as
App Engine and Compute Engine, to generate
short-lived credentials for service accounts .
Google-owned and managed keys that are actively used for
signing are rotated regularly according to
security best practices . The rotation process
is probabilistic; usage of the new key will gradually ramp up and down over the
key's lifetime.
The private key in a Google-owned and managed key pair is always held
in escrow, and you can never access it directly.
The public key in a Google-owned and managed key pair is publicly
accessible, so that anyone can verify signatures that are created with the
private key. You can access the public key in several different formats:
X.509 certificate:
https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/metadata/x509/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
JSON Web Key (JWK):
https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
Raw format:
https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/metadata/raw/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
If you download and cache the public key, we recommend caching it for at most 24
hours to ensure that you always have the current key. Regardless of when you
retrieve the public key, it will be valid for at least 24 hours after you
retrieve it.
User-managed key pairs
You can create user-managed key pairs for a service account, then use the
private key from each key pair to authenticate with Google APIs. This private
key is known as a service account key .
The Cloud Client Libraries can use service account keys to obtain an OAuth 2.0
access token automatically. You can also use a service account key to sign a JWT
manually, then use the signed JWT to request an access token. For details, see
Using OAuth 2.0 for server to server applications .
Caution:
Service account keys are a security risk if not managed correctly. You should
choose a more secure alternative to service account keys
whenever possible. If you must authenticate with a service account key, you are responsible for the
security of the private key and for other operations described by
Best practices for managing service account keys .
If you are prevented from creating a service account key, service account key creation might
be disabled for your organization. For more information, see
Managing secure-by-default organization resources .
If you acquired the service account key from an external source, you must validate it before use.
For more information, see
Security requirements for externally sourced credentials .
Each service account can have up to 10 service
account keys. Google stores only the public portion of a user-managed key pair.
There are a few different ways to create a user-managed key pair for a service
account:
Use the IAM API to
create a user-managed key pair automatically . Google generates
a public/private key pair; stores only the public key; and returns the private
key to you.
Create a user-managed key pair yourself, then
upload only the public key . Google never sees the private key.
User-managed keys are extremely powerful credentials. To limit the use of
user-managed keys, you can enforce the following
organization policy constraints in an organization,
project, or folder:
constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation : Prevents principals from
creating user-managed service account keys.
constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload : Prevents principals from
uploading a public key for a service account.
Note : If your organization was created on or after May 3, 2024, these
constraints are enforced by default.
If you enforce these constraints because you are using workload identity
federation , consider using the organization
policy constraints for workload identity
federation to specify which identity providers
are allowed.
Expiry times for user-managed keys
By default, when you create a user-managed service account key, the key never
expires. You can change this default by setting an expiry time for all newly
created keys in your project, folder, or organization. An expiry time specifies
the number of hours for which a newly created key is valid.
Use expiry times when you need temporary
access to a system that requires a service account key. For example, use expiry
times when you're doing the following:
Developing code in a non-production environment for an application that can
only authenticate with service account keys
Using a third-party tool that can only authenticate with service account keys
Avoid using expiry times for these scenarios:
Production workloads. In production, an expired service account key could
cause an accidental outage. Instead, use keys that do not expire, and manage
their lifecycle with key rotation.
Non-production workloads that need permanent access, such as a continuous
integration (CI) pipeline.
Key-rotation systems that prevent a key from being used after a specified
amount of time. To learn about recommended key rotation strategies, see
Service account key rotation .
To help prevent outages, we recommend that you do not set an expiry time unless
the constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation
organization policy constraint has been in place for
an extended period of time. When you set an expiry time, you must also stop
enforcing the constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation constraint. For
details about this constraint, see
Limit lifetime of service account keys .
Important: If the constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation constraint
was not in place, you must work closely with the users of the project, folder,
or organization to confirm that none of their existing resources require
permanent service account keys. If a resource requires permanent service account
keys, and you set an expiry time, you are likely to cause an outage.
To set an expiry time, do the following:
Identify the project, folder, or organization where you want to set an
expiry time for service account keys.
Add an organization policy that enforces the
constraints/iam.serviceAccountKeyExpiryHours constraint .
After you enforce this constraint for your project, folder, or organization,
the expiry time applies to all newly created service account keys within
that parent resource. Existing keys are not affected.
Expiry times are measured in hours. As a best practice, use short expiry times,
such as 8 hours; 24 hours (1 day); or 168 hours (7 days). Short expiry times
help ensure that your team has a well-tested process for updating keys. Start
with the shortest expiry time that meets your needs, and increase it only if
necessary.
