What's next
This page explains how to list and get service account keys using the
Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI ,
the Identity and Access Management API , or one
of the Google Cloud Client Libraries .
Note: If you need to access resources from a workload that runs outside
of Google Cloud, such as on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure,
consider using Workload Identity Federation instead of service account keys. Federation lets your
workloads access resources directly, using a short-lived access token, and
eliminates the maintenance and security burden associated with service account
keys.
Before you begin
Enable the IAM API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Set up authentication.
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console gcloud C# C++ Go Java Python REST
More
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
In one of the following development environments, set up the gcloud CLI:
Cloud Shell : to use an online terminal with the gcloud CLI
already set up, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell on this page
At the bottom of this page, a Cloud Shell session starts and displays a
command-line prompt. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Local shell : to use a local development environment,
install and
initialize the gcloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .

If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider

signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .

Understand service account credentials .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to list and get service account keys,
ask your administrator to grant you the
View Service Accounts ( roles/iam.serviceAccountViewer )
IAM role on either the project or the service account whose keys you
want to manage.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
IAM basic roles also contain permissions to manage service
account keys.
You should not grant basic roles in a production environment, but you can grant them in a
development or test environment.
List service account keys
You can list the service account keys for a service account using the
Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI, the
serviceAccount.keys.list()
method, or one of the client libraries .
The serviceAccount.keys.list() method is commonly used to audit service
accounts and keys, or to build custom tooling for managing service accounts.
To find out which project your key belongs to, you can download the key as a
JSON file and look at that file.
You might see keys listed that you did not create. These are keys created by
Google and used by the Service Account Credentials API. To learn more, see
Google-owned and managed key pairs .

Get a service account key
You can use the gcloud CLI or the REST API to get the public key data
for a service account key. In addition, you can use the Google Cloud console,
the gcloud CLI, or the REST API to get metadata for the key, such as
the algorithm that the key uses and whether the key is managed by you or by
Google.
Some applications or tools might need access to the public key data or metadata
for a service account key for things like auditing and interoperability with
external systems. For example, Terraform
might need to verify that the state of a service account key in Google Cloud
matches what's defined in the Terraform configuration file.
Note: You cannot get the private key data for a service account key. This data
is available only when the key is created.

--iam-account = SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--output-file = FILENAME
Provide the following values:
KEY_ID : The ID of the public key you want to get.
To find the key's ID, list all keys for the service account ,
identify the key that you want to get, and then copy its ID.
SA_NAME : The name of the service account whose public
key you want to get.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
FILENAME : The file in which to save the public key
data.
By default, the public key data is saved in X.509 PEM format. To get the raw
public key, run the command with the additional flag --type=raw .
For example, the following command gets the public key data for the key
c97cc34494c07c9b483701f28368f20145b9ef97 , which belongs to the service account
my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com , then saves the public
key data to the file public_key.pem :
gcloud beta iam service-accounts keys get-public-key \
c97cc34494c07c9b483701f28368f20145b9ef97 \
--iam-account = my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--output-file = public_key.pem
To get metadata for a service account key:
Run the gcloud iam service-accounts keys list command:
gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account = SA_NAME \
--filter = "name~ KEY_ID " --format = json
Provide the following values:
SA_NAME : The name of the service account for which you
want key metadata.
KEY_ID : The ID of the key for which you want metadata.
For example, the following command gets metadata for the key
c97cc34494c07c9b483701f28368f20145b9ef97 , which belongs to the service account
my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com :
gcloud iam service-accounts keys list \
--iam-account = my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--filter = "name~c97cc34494c07c9b483701f28368f20145b9ef97" --format = json
The
projects.serviceAccounts.keys.get
method returns information about a public key for a service account.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project
ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
SA_NAME : The name of the service account whose public key you want to
get.
KEY_ID : The ID of the public key you want to get. To find the key's ID,
list all keys for the service account , identify the key that you want
to get, and then copy its ID from the end of the name field. The key's ID is
everything after keys/ .
KEY_TYPE : The format in which to return the public key. Use
TYPE_X509_PEM_FILE for X.509 PEM format or TYPE_RAW_PUBLIC_KEY for the
raw public key. If you omit this query parameter, the method returns metadata for the key, but
it does not return the public key data.
