What's next
Managed workload identities lets you bind strongly attested identities to your
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Compute Engine workloads. This also includes
agent identities, which are designed for agentic workloads.
Google Cloud provisions X.509 credentials and trust anchors that are issued from
Certificate Authority Service . The credentials and
trust anchors can be used to reliably authenticate your workload with other
workloads through mutual TLS (mTLS)
authentication.
The following features are available in Preview :
Managed workload identities for GKE
Managed workload identities for Compute Engine
Request access to the managed workload identities for Compute Engine
Agent identities
SPIFFE interoperability
To enable interoperability across dynamic and heterogeneous environments,
managed workload identities is based on Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) .
SPIFFE defines a framework and set of standards for identifying, authenticating,
and securing communications between workloads. SPIFFE workloads are identified
by a unique SPIFFE ID. In Google Cloud, a SPIFFE ID has the following
formats:
Compute Engine workloads:
spiffe:// POOL_ID .global. PROJECT_NUMBER .workload.id.goog/ns/ NAMESPACE_ID /sa/ MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID
GKE workloads:
spiffe:// PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog/ns/ KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE /sa/ KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
Agent identity workloads:
spiffe://agents.global.org- ORGANIZATION_ID .system.id.goog/resources/aiplatform/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /reasoningEngines/ AGENT_NAME
Resource hierarchy
This section describes managed workload identity resources.
Workload identity pools
Managed workload identities are defined within a workload identity pool ,
which acts as a trust boundary for all identities within the pool. The workload
identity pool forms the trust domain component of the managed workload
identity's SPIFFE identifier. We recommend creating a new pool for each logical
environment in your organization, such as development, staging, or production.
Namespaces
Within a workload identity pool, managed workload identities are organized
into administrative boundaries called namespaces . Namespaces help you
organize and grant access to related workload identities.
Attestation policies
Managed workload identity for Compute Engine requires that you configure
attestation policies .
Managed workload identity for GKE manages attestation policies
for you.
Workload attestation policies let you define which workload can be issued a
credential for a managed workload identity based on the workload's verifiable
attributes, such as project ID or resource name. A workload attestation policy
ensures that only trusted workloads can use the managed identity.
