Searches all Google Cloud resources within the specified scope, such as a project, folder, or organization. The caller must be granted the cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission on the desired scope, otherwise the request will be rejected.
HTTP request
GET https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/{scope=*/*}:searchAllResources
The URL uses gRPC Transcoding syntax.
Path parameters
Parameters
scope
string
Required. A scope can be a project, a folder, or an organization. The search is limited to the resources within the scope . The caller must be granted the cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources permission on the desired scope.
