Cloud Asset Inventory overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud Asset Inventory is a global metadata inventory service that lets you view, search,
export, monitor, and analyze your Google Cloud asset metadata. Tasks that you
might use Cloud Asset Inventory for include the following:
Resource discovery and management : filter by metadata properties such as
location, time created, tags, and status.
Resource monitoring : track changes to a resource over time to create an
audit trail, debug problems, and manage compliance drift.
Security and cost audits : find resources that are over-permissioned,
publicly exposed, or unused to minimize attack surface and optimize costs.
Create, update, and delete history for assets is kept for up to 35 days. Assets
that haven't changed in the past 35 days return their latest status.
Work with assets in Google Cloud
Here's how you can work with your assets:
List your assets and their relationships
in a particular project, folder, or organization, and
get asset history up to 35 days in the past .
Search for your resources and their
IAM allow policies
using a custom query language, or
query your assets with BigQuery SQL .
Export your asset metadata to
BigQuery or
Cloud Storage .
Analyze what would happen if a resource was moved to another project .
Analyze your IAM and organization policies
on resources, and
View your effective IAM policies
on resources to see who has access to what.
Monitor your assets for changes by
setting up and subscribing to a feed .
Generate insights from your assets
to help improve your security posture.
Asset metadata sources
Asset metadata can come from the following places:
Google Cloud resources , such as Compute Engine VM instances,
Cloud Storage buckets, and App Engine instances.
Policies set on Google Cloud resources, such as IAM
policies, organization policies, and Access Context Manager policies.
Runtime information from
OS inventory management .
Asset types, asset names, and content types
Cloud Asset Inventory offers multiple methods to interact with your assets. Depending on
the method you use and the response detail you want, you might need to specify
asset types, asset names, and content types in your requests.
Asset types
Some Cloud Asset Inventory methods return results based on asset types. Asset types
include Google Cloud resources, policies, OS inventory runtime
information, and relationships. The available asset types and the Cloud Asset Inventory
methods that support them are detailed in
Asset types .
Asset names
Some Cloud Asset Inventory methods return results based on asset names. When specifying
an asset name, you must use its full resource name. See
Asset names for a list of full resource
names.
Content types
You can request additional metadata on a resource by specifying a metadata
content type. If you don't specify a content type, then only a basic response
is returned, which contains information such as the asset name, the last time it
was updated, and the projects, folders, and organizations it belongs to.
Content type names differ depending on how you interact with Cloud Asset Inventory.
The RPC and REST API names are the same. However, the gcloud CLI
content type names follow a different pattern. For consistency and ease of
explanation, the rest of this documentation refers to content types by their
RPC and REST names.
The following table details the content types and their descriptions:
Content type
Description
RPC and REST name
gcloud CLI name
ACCESS_POLICY
access-policy
The
Access Context Manager
policy set on an asset.
IAM_POLICY
iam-policy
The IAM policy metadata binding to the resource.
ORG_POLICY
org-policy
The organization policy metadata set on an asset. This content type
outputs legacy organization policy v1. For organization policy v2, try
the resource content type and a resource type of
orgpolicy.googleapis.com/Policy .
OS_INVENTORY
os-inventory
The runtime OS inventory information. To enable OS inventory, complete
the relevant steps in
Set up VM Manager .
RELATIONSHIP
relationship
Requires access to the
Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier .
Many Google Cloud assets are connected to each other by
relationships. For example, a
Compute instance group can
contain a Compute instance , or
a
GKE cluster
can contain a
node .
Relationship data is available from May 30th, 2022. A relationship
might have its own update timestamp, because it might be inferred at a
different time than the source asset updates.
See
Relationship types
for a list of the supported relationships.
RESOURCE
resource
The resource's metadata.
Note: The ancestors field in the response to some requests can be inconsistent
across content types. This is because there are different data ingestion
schedules for each content type, and their update times might not align. Check
the update_time field to ensure that the asset has the most up-to-date
information. Contact Cloud Customer Care
if the inconsistency lasts for more than 24 hours.
How responses change with content type
The following examples show how responses change when listing VM instances in a
project through Cloud Asset Inventory with different content types.
No content type
If you specify no content type when listing VM instances, you receive only the
instance names, the last time they were updated, and what projects, folders,
and organizations they belong to.

ancestors:
- projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER
- folders/ FOLDER_NUMBER
- organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID
assetType: compute.googleapis.com/Instance
name: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME
updateTime: '2023-11-15T12:28:30.087825Z'
IAM_POLICY content type
If you specify the IAM_POLICY content type, you also receive the
IAM bindings on the VM, if there are any.

ancestors:
- projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER
- folders/ FOLDER_NUMBER
- organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID
assetType: compute.googleapis.com/Instance

name: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME
updateTime: '2023-12-19T23:35:42.673842Z'
RELATIONSHIP content type
Relationships require access to the
Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier .
If you specify the RELATIONSHIP content type, you also receive metadata
associated with the VM instance's related assets.
Expand for response example
---
ancestors:
- projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER
- folders/ FOLDER_NUMBER
- organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID
assetType: compute.googleapis.com/Instance
name: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME
relatedAsset:
ancestors:
- projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER
- folders/ FOLDER_NUMBER
- organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID
asset: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /disks/ INSTANCE_NAME
assetType: compute.googleapis.com/Disk
relationshipType: COMPUTE_INSTANCE_USE_DISK
updateTime: '2023-12-19T23:35:42.673842Z'
When using the RELATIONSHIP content type, instead of requesting all
relationships, you can request specific
relationship types .
RESOURCE content type
If you specify the RESOURCE content type, you also receive all the metadata
associated with the VM.

Data freshness
Cloud Asset Inventory provides eventual consistency on current data and best-effort
consistency on historical data. While rare, it's possible that Cloud Asset Inventory can
miss some data updates.
Unless noted in the
resource types
table, almost all asset updates are available in minutes.
