Perform CRUD operations on a MySQL database
This tutorial shows you how to connect to a MySQL database instance from a
sample integration and perform List, Get, Create, Update, and Delete operations
on a MySQL database table.
To complete this tutorial, perform the following tasks:
Set up a database and table in your MySQL server
Create a MySQL connection
Configure an Integration to use the MySQL connection
Test the Integration
Perform other operations on your MySQL database table
Before you begin
Ensure that you have access to integrations.
Do the following in your Google Cloud project:
Grant the following roles to the service account that you want to use to create the connection:
roles/secretmanager.viewer
roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
Enable the following services:
secretmanager.googleapis.com (Secret Manager API)
connectors.googleapis.com (Connectors API)
If these services have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them
when creating the connection in the Create Connection page.
Ensure that you have access to a MySQL server that you can use to create a database.
Set up a database and table in your MySQL server
Connect to your MySQL server and create a database and a table to use in this tutorial.
To connect to your MySQL server, execute the following command from a system that has a MySQL client installed:
mysql --host= MySQL server host name or IP address --port= MySQL server port number -u username -p password
In this example, replace:
MySQL server host name or IP address with the name or IP address of your MySQL server.
MySQL server port number with the port number for your MySQL server.
username with the username for your MySQL server.
password with the password for your MySQL server.
To create a MySQL database to use in this tutorial, execute the following command from your MySQL client:
CREATE DATABASE tutorialDB;
To create a table to use in this tutorial, execute the following command from your MySQL client:
create table employee
(
employee_id int auto_increment primary key,
employee_first_name varchar(500) NOT null,
employee_last_name varchar(500) NOT null,
employee_emailID varchar(500)
);
To add rows to the employee table that you created, execute the following command from your MySQL client:
INSERT INTO employee (employee_first_name,employee_last_name,employee_emailID) values ("Peter","Dilliard","test-01@test.com");
INSERT INTO employee (employee_first_name,employee_last_name,employee_emailID) values ("Meaghan","Webb","test-02@test.com");
Verify that the table is created and rows are added by executing the following command:
SELECT * FROM employee;
The following table rows are displayed:
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| employee_id | employee_first_name | employee_last_name | employee_emailID |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| 1 | Peter | Dilliard | test-01@test.com |
| 2 | Meaghan | Webb | test-02@test.com |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
Create a MySQL connection
To enable an integration to connect to your MySQL database, create a new connection
to your MySQL database:
Click +Create new to open the Create Connection page.
In the Location section, choose the location for the connection.
From the Region list, select the region where you want to create the connection.
For the list of all the supported regions, see Locations .
Click Next .
In the Connection Details section, enter the following details:
From the Connector list, select MySQL .
From the Connector version list, select the connector version.
In the Connection Name field, enter a name for the connection instance.
Connection names must meet the following criteria:
Use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
Letters must be lower-case.
Names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
Names cannot exceed 49 characters.
Optional: In the Description field, add a description of the connection instance.
Optional: Enable Cloud Logging .
From the Service Account list, select a service account that has the required roles .
In the Database name field, enter the name of the MySQL database.
Optionally, configure the Connection node settings :
Minimum number of nodes : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
Maximum number of nodes : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.
A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions.
More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely,
fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions.
To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see
Pricing for connection nodes . If you don't enter any values, by default
the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.
Note: You can customize the connection node values only if you are
a Pay-as-you-go customer.
(Optional) In the Advanced settings section, select the Use proxy checkbox to configure a proxy server for the connection and configure the following values:
Proxy Auth Scheme : Select the authentication type to authenticate with the proxy server. The following authentication types are supported:
Basic : Basic HTTP authentication.
Digest : Digest HTTP authentication.
Proxy User : A user name to be used to authenticate with the proxy server.
Proxy Password : The Secret manager secret of the user's password.
Proxy SSL Type : The SSL type to use when connecting to the proxy server. The following authentication types are supported:
Auto : Default setting. If the URL is an HTTPS URL, then the Tunnel option is used. If the URL is an HTTP URL, then the NEVER option is used.
Always : The connection is always SSL enabled.
Never : The connection is not SSL enabled.
Tunnel : The connection is through a tunneling proxy. The proxy server opens a connection to the remote host and traffic flows back and forth through the proxy.
In the Proxy Server section, enter details of the proxy server.
Click + Add destination .
Select a Destination Type .
Host address : Specify the hostname or IP address of the destination.
If you want to establish a private connection to your backend system, do the following:
Create a PSC service attachment .
Create an endpoint attachment and
then enter the details of the endpoint attachment in the Host address field.
Optional: To add a label to the connection, click +Add Label .
Click Next .
In the Destinations section, enter details of the remote host (backend system) to
which you want to connect.
From the Destination Type list, select a host address.
To specify the destination hostname or IP address, select Host address and
enter the address in the Host 1 field.
To establish a private connection, select Host Address and add the endpoint attachment created for the SAP Gateway using the HTTPS protocol.
Note: To understand how to create an endpoint attachment, see
PSC service attachment
and endpoint attachment . After you
have created the endpoint attachment, it will be visible in the Endpoint Attachment list.
If you want to establish a public connection to your backend systems with additional security, you can
consider configuring static outbound
IP addresses for your connections , and then configure
your firewall rules to allowlist only the specific static IP addresses.
To enter additional destinations, click +Add Destination .
Click Next .
In the Authentication section, you can provide credentials:
In the Username field, enter the MySQL username for the connection.
In the Password field, enter the Secret Manager
secret containing the password associated with the MySQL username.
If you have previously created a secret, and it is not available in the list,
select Enter Secret Manually . In the Add a secret by resource
ID dialog, copy and paste the resource ID from
the Secret Manager .
To use the latest version, copy and paste the resource ID from the parent secret, in the format:
"projects/project-number/secrets/secret-name"
To select a specific version, copy and paste the resource ID for that specific version, in the
format "projects/project-number/secrets/secret-name/versions/1"
To add the secret, click Add Secret .
If you have not created a secret for use with MySQL, click Create
New Secret . In the Create Secret dialog enter the following details:
In the Name field, enter the secret name.
In the Secret value field, enter the contents of the secret or upload
a file that contains the secret.
Click Create Secret .
From the Secret version list, select the version of the Password secret from the list of available versions in the drop-down.
Click Next .
In the Review section, review your connection and authentication details.
Click Create .
Configure an Integration to use the MySQL connection
To use the MySQL connection that you created in an integration, add a Connectors task in an integration along with an API Trigger . The API Trigger is connected to the Connectors task using an Edge connection.
Create a new Integration
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Integration Connectors page.
Go to Integration Connectors
In the navigation menu, click Integrations .
The Integrations List page appears.
Select an existing integration or create a new integration by clicking CREATE INTEGRATION .
This opens the integration in the integration editor page.
In the integration editor, click +Add a task/trigger > Tasks to view the list of available tasks.
Click CREATE NEW .
Enter a name and (optionally) a description in the Create Integration dialog.
Note : Integration names must meet the following requirements:
Names must start and end with letters or numbers.
Names cannot contain spaces or more than one dash or underscore in a row.
Click Create to open the integration editor.
Add and configure an API trigger
To add and configure an API trigger to the integration, do the following:
In the integration editor, select Add a task/trigger > Triggers to display a list of available triggers.
Drag the API Trigger element to the integration editor.
Add and configure a Connectors task
Perform the following steps to configure a Connectors task to list all the entities in the employee table:
Select +Add a task/trigger > Tasks in the integration editor to display the list of available tasks.
Drag the Connectors element to the integration editor.
Click the Connectors task element on the designer to view the task configuration pane.
Click Configure task .
The Configure connector task dialog appears.
In the Configure connector task dialog, do the following:
Select the connection region where you created your MySQL connection.
Once a region is chosen, the Connection column appears. Select the MySQL connection that you created from the list of available connections.
Once a connection is chosen, the Type column appears. Select Entities and then employee from the list of available entities.
Once a type is chosen, the Operation column appears. Select List .
Click Done to complete the connection configuration and close the dialog.
Connect the API Trigger element to the Connectors task element
Next, add an edge connection to connect the API trigger to the Connectors task. An edge connection is a connection between any two elements in an integration. For more information on edges and edge conditions, see Edges .
To add the edge connection, click the Fork control point at the bottom of the API Trigger element. Drag and drop the edge connection at the Join control point at the top of the Connectors task element.
Test the Integration
To test the integration, do the following:
Click the Test button in the integration editor toolbar.
Change the Execution Deadline (in minutes) value, if you like, and then click Test Integration .
Once the integration completes successfully, the Test Integration pane displays the message Integration execution succeeded . To view the logs, click View logs .
In Response Parameters , under Connector output payload , the following output is displayed:
[ {
"employee_id": 1.0,
"employee_first_name": "Peter",
"employee_last_name": "Dilliard",
"employee_emailID": "test-01@test.com"
},
{
"employee_id": 2.0,
"employee_first_name": "Meaghan",
"employee_last_name": "Webb",
"employee_emailID": "test-02@test.com"
} ]
Perform other operations on your MySQL database table
When you configure a Connectors task in your integration, you can select any one of the following operations:
List
Get
Create
Update
Delete
You've already used the List operation to view all the rows in the employee table. In the following sections of this tutorial, you'll use the Get, Create, Update, and Delete operations to add, modify or remove rows from the employee table.
Get a row from a table
If you know the entity ID (or primary key) of the row that you want to fetch, provide that value as input to a Get operation in your integration. The details returned by the Get operation are similar to the details returned by the List operation. However, while the List operation fetches details of all the table rows that match the specified query, the Get operation fetches details of only the table row that matches the specified entity ID.
Remember that, while the List operation by default returns all the rows in the table, the Get operation requires an entity ID as a search parameter. So, to use the Get operation, you must know the entity ID of the row that you want to fetch, or provide a default value for the entity ID.
To get details of a specified row, perform the following steps to configure the Connectors task that you created earlier:
Click the Connectors task element on the designer to view the task configuration pane.
Click Configure task .
The Configure connector task dialog appears.
In the Configure connector task dialog, in the Operation column, select Get and then click Done .
In the task configuration pane, under Task Input click Entity ID .
In the Configure Variable dialog, select Use as an input to integration and click Save .
Click the Test button in the integration editor toolbar.
Change the Execution Deadline (in minutes) value, if you like.
Enter the entity ID of the entity for which you want to fetch details. Enter 2 .
Click Test Integration .
Once the integration completes successfully, the Test Integration pane displays the message Integration execution succeeded . To view the logs, click View logs .
In Response Parameters , under Connector output payload , the following output is displayed:
[ {
"employee_id": 2.0,
"employee_first_name": "Meaghan",
"employee_last_name": "Webb",
"employee_emailID": "test-02@test.com"
} ]
You can verify that the information displayed here matches the information in the corresponding row in your MySQL table. To view this information in your MySQL table, execute the following command from your MySQL client:
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE employee_id=2;
The following table row is displayed:
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| employee_id | employee_first_name | employee_last_name | employee_emailID |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| 2 | Meaghan | Webb | test-02@test.com |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
Add a row to a table
The Create operation allows you to add a row in a table. When you use the Create operation, you must provide all the values for the entity in the connector input payload.
To add a row using the Create operation, perform the following steps to configure the Connectors task that you created earlier:
Click the Connectors task element on the designer to view the task
configuration pane.
Click Configure task .
The Configure connector task dialog appears.
In the Configure connector task dialog, in the Operation column, select Create and then click Done .
In the task configuration pane, under Task Input click Connector input payload .
In the Configure Variable dialog, select Use as an input to integration and click Save .
Click the Test button in the integration editor toolbar.
Change the Execution Deadline (in minutes) value, if you like.
Enter the details for the entity that you want to create. For example, to add a new employee in the employee table, enter the following JSON:
{
"employee_first_name": "Mary",
"employee_last_name": "Smith",
"employee_emailID": "test-03@test.com"
}
Note : Don't specify the primary key, employee_id , as it is a read-only value that is generated when the row is added to the table.
Click Test Integration .
Once the integration completes successfully, the Test Integration pane displays the message Integration execution succeeded . To view the logs, click View logs .
In Response Parameters , under Connector input payload , the payload that you provided is displayed:
{
"employee_first_name": "Mary",
"employee_last_name": "Smith",
"employee_emailID": "test-03@test.com"
}
Under Connector output payload , the entity ID is displayed as output:
{
"employee_id": 3.0
}
You can verify that the row is added in your MySQL table. To view this information in your MySQL table, execute the following command from your MySQL client:
SELECT * FROM employee;
The following table rows are displayed:
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| employee_id | employee_first_name | employee_last_name | employee_emailID |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| 1 | Peter | Dilliard | test-01@test.com |
| 2 | Meaghan | Webb | test-02@test.com |
| 3 | Mary | Smith | test-03@test.com |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
Update a row in a table
Use the Update operation to make changes to the values in a table row. For example, you can use this operation to update the email ID of an employee in the employee table. To specify the entity that you want to update, you can provide the entity ID as you did for the Get operation. Alternatively, you can use the Filter clause parameter to pass values on which to filter the table rows. This is useful if you want to make the same change in multiple rows based on specific search criteria.
To update a table row, perform the following steps to configure the Connectors task that you created earlier:
Click the Connectors task element on the designer to view the task configuration pane.
Click Configure task .
The Configure connector task dialog appears.
In the Configure connector task dialog, in the Operation column, select Update and then click Done .
In the task configuration pane, under Task Input click Connector input payload .
In the Configure Variable dialog, select Use as an input to integration and click Save .
Next, in the task configuration pane, under Task Input click Filter clause .
In the Configure Variable dialog, select Use as an input to integration and click Save .
Click the Test button in the integration editor toolbar.
Change the Execution Deadline (in minutes) value, if you like.
Enter the criteria that you want to filter by. For example, to find an employee with the email ID test-03@test.com , enter:
employee_emailID="test-03@test.com"
Note : If you have multiple table rows that match the filter criteria, the update that you specify in the next step is made on all the matching rows.
Enter the values that you want to update. For example, to update the email ID of all the employees in the employee table whose current email ID matches the filter clause test-03@test.com , enter the following JSON:
{
"employee_emailID": "msmith@test.com"
}
Note : You don't need to specify values for all the columns in the table. Enter the values that you want to update. The other values aren't modified.
Click Test Integration .
Once the integration completes successfully, the Test Integration pane displays the message Integration execution succeeded . To validate that the entity was updated, use the Get operation to get the details of the specified entity.
You can verify that the row is updated in your MySQL table. To view this information in your MySQL table, execute the following command from your MySQL client:
SELECT * FROM employee;
The following table rows are displayed:
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| employee_id | employee_first_name | employee_last_name | employee_emailID |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| 1 | Peter | Dilliard | test-01@test.com |
| 2 | Meaghan | Webb | test-02@test.com |
| 3 | Mary | Smith | msmith@test.com |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
Delete a row in a table
You can use the Delete operation to delete one or more table rows. Provide the entity ID or use the filter clause to specify the rows that you want to delete. Remember that, if you use the filter clause to specify criteria for rows that you want to delete, it's possible to delete multiple rows that match the given filter. If you want to delete only one specific row, use the entity ID.
To delete a table row using the entity ID, perform the following steps to configure the Connectors task that you created earlier:
Click the Connectors task element on the designer to view the task configuration pane.
Click Configure task .
The Configure connector task dialog appears.
In the Configure connector task dialog, in the Operation column, select Delete and then click Done .
In the task configuration pane, under Task Input click Entity ID .
In the Configure Variable dialog, select Use as an input to integration and click Save .
Click the Test button in the integration editor toolbar.
Change the Execution Deadline (in minutes) value, if you like.
Enter the entity ID of the table row that you want to delete. Enter 3 .
Click Test Integration .
Once the integration completes successfully, the Test Integration pane displays the message Integration execution succeeded . To validate that the table row was deleted, use the Get operation to get the details of the row that you deleted. This should return an error for the specified entity ID.
You can also use the List operation and optionally provide a filter clause for the table row (or rows) that you deleted. This returns the list of rows remaining, which could be an empty list.
For example, if you deleted the table row with entity ID 3, then if you specify the filter clause employee_emailID="msmith@test.com" or the entity ID 3 for the List operation, the response parameters in the logs display [] .
You can verify that the row is deleted in your MySQL table. To verify this in your MySQL table, execute the following command from your MySQL client:
SELECT * FROM employee;
The following table rows are displayed:
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| employee_id | employee_first_name | employee_last_name | employee_emailID |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
| 1 | Peter | Dilliard | test-01@test.com |
| 2 | Meaghan | Webb | test-02@test.com |
+-------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------------+
