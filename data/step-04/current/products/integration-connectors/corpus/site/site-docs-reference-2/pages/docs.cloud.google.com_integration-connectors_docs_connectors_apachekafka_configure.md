Apache Kafka
Use the Kafka connector to integrate with Apache Kafka and publish messages to specific topics. The Kafka connector also supports event subscription, which allows the creation of triggers when messages are received in a topic.
Supported versions
The Apache Kafka connector leverages the native client libraries to establish a connection to
a given Kafka cluster, and the connector works with client version 3.3.1. However, the connector
can establish connectivity to Kafka clusters from versions 3.0 to 3.3.1.
Before you begin
Before using the Apache Kafka connector, do the following tasks:
In your Google Cloud project:
Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see Network connectivity .
Grant the roles/connectors.admin IAM role to the user
configuring the connector.
Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector:
roles/secretmanager.viewer
roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human
user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs.
If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. The connector and the service account must belong to the same project. For more
information, see
Creating a service account .
Enable the following services:
secretmanager.googleapis.com (Secret Manager API)
connectors.googleapis.com (Connectors API)
To understand how to enable services, see Enabling services .
If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them
when configuring the connector.
Configure the connector
A connection is specific to a data source. It
means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection
for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:
In the Cloud console , go to the Integration Connectors > Connections page
and then select or create a Google Cloud project.
Go to the Connections page
Click + CREATE NEW to open the Create Connection page.
In the Location step, choose the location for the new Apache Kafka connection:
Region: Select a region from the list.
Click Next .
In the Connection Details step, provide details about the new Apache Kafka connection:
Connector version: Choose an available version of the Apache Kafka connector from the list.
Connection Name: Enter a name for the Apache Kafka connection.
Note: Connection names must meet the following criteria:
Connection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
Letters must be lower-case.
Connection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
Connection names cannot exceed 49 characters.
For connectors that support event subscription , the connection names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix.
(Optional) Description: Enter a description for the connection.
(Optional) Enable Cloud Logging: Select this checkbox to store all log data of the connection.
Service Account : Select a service account with the required IAM roles for the Apache Kafka connection.
The Enable event subscription, entity and actions option is selected by default for the Apache Kafka connection.
Note: This connector doesn't support the
Enable only event subscription option.
Type Detection Scheme: Select MessageOnly .
Registry Service : The Schema Registry service used for working with topic schemas.
Registry Type : Type of the schema specified for the a specific topic.
Registry Version : Version of the schema read from RegistryUrl for the specified topic.
Registry User : Username or Access Key value to authorize with the server specified in RegistryUrl .
Registry Password : Secret Manager Secret containing the password/secret Key value to authorize with the server specified in RegistryUrl .
Optionally, configure the Connection node settings :
Minimum number of nodes : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
Maximum number of nodes : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.
A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions.
More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely,
fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions.
To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see
Pricing for connection nodes . If you don't enter any values, by default
the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.
Note: You can customize the connection node values only if you are
a Pay-as-you-go customer.
Optionally, click + ADD LABEL to add a label to the Connection in the form of a key and value pair.
Enable SSL : This field sets whether SSL is enabled.
Click Next .
In the Destinations section, enter details of the Kafka bootstrap server you want to connect to.
Destination Type : Select a Destination Type .
To specify the destination hostname or IP address, select Host address and
enter the address in the Host 1 field.
To establish a private connection, select Host Address and add the endpoint attachment created for the SAP Gateway using the HTTPS protocol.
Note: To understand how to create an endpoint attachment, see
PSC service attachment
and endpoint attachment . After you
have created the endpoint attachment, it will be visible in the Endpoint Attachment list.
If you want to establish a public connection to your backend systems with additional security, you can
consider configuring static outbound
IP addresses for your connections , and then configure
your firewall rules to allowlist only the specific static IP addresses.
To specify additional Kafka bootstrap servers, click + ADD DESTINATION .
Click Next .
In the Authentication section, enter the authentication details.
Select an Authentication type and enter the relevant details.
The following authentication types are supported by the Apache Kafka connection:
Username and password
Username : The Apache Kafka username to use for the connection.
Password : Secret Manager Secret containing the password associated with the Apache Kafka username.
Auth Scheme : The scheme used for authentication.
The following Auth Scheme are supported by the Apache Kafka connection:
Plain
SCRAM-SHA-1
SCRAM-SHA-256
Not Available
If you want to use anonymous login, select Not Available .
Click Next .
Enter the dead-letter configuration. If you configure dead-letter, the connection writes
the unprocessed events to the specified Pub/Sub topic . Enter the following details:
Dead-letter project ID: The Google Cloud project ID where you have configured the dead-letter Pub/Sub topic.
Dead-letter topic: The Pub/Sub topic where you want to write the details of the unprocessed event.
Click Next .
Review : Review your connection and authentication details.
Click Create .
System limitations
The Apache Kafka connector can process a maximum of 50 transactions per second,
per node ,
and throttles any
transactions beyond this limit.
By default, Integration Connectors allocates 2 nodes (for better availability) for a connection.
For information on the limits applicable to Integration Connectors, see Limits .
Note: The number of Integration Connectors nodes will autoscale dynamically
based on your usage. However, if you want to reserve capacity for large volumes without
waiting for autoscaling, you can adjust the minimum node value for a connection. More
nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection. Conversely, fewer nodes
are required if a connection processes fewer transactions. To configure the node
values, do the following:
If you are a pay-as-you-go customer, configure the minimum and maximum node value
in the edit connection page.
If you are a subscription based
customer, contact support .
The maximum transactions that a node can handle depends on various factors. So, before adjusting the minimum nodes for better throughput,
it is recommended you check if your backend systems are set up optimally to handle the required traffic.

Configuration for Confluent Cloud
Configuration for the Confluent Cloud differs slightly
from the previously documented steps for Apache Kafka. Consider the following points
when creating a connection for Confluent Cloud:
The Confluent Cloud cluster API key is used as the username, and the key's Secret Manager Secret is used as the password for
connecting to the bootstrap servers. You need to create an API key in Confluent Cloud
if you don't have it already.
Select Use SSL in the Connection Details section.
If you are using schema registry, configure the following values:
In the Connection Details section:
Registry Version: Enter the registry version number. If you want to use the latest
version, enter latest .
Registry User: Enter the schema registry API key. You need to create a schema registry
API key if you don't have it already.
