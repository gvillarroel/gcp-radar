Public network connectivity
This page describes how Integration Connectors can connect to your publicly accessible backend applications.
The following are the two ways to connect to your public backend application:
Connect to your public backend application directly.
Connect to your public backend application through a firewall.
Connect to your public backend application directly
If you can publicly connect to your backend application, you can
configure your connection to use the
public endpoint by specifying the endpoint in the Hostname
field. Your connections will have direct access to your backend application.
Connect to your public backend application through a firewall
In cases where you want to restrict access to your public
endpoints with a firewall, you can configure
Integration Connectors to use a set of static IP addresses for
the traffic originating from the connections. After the configuration, all calls from a connection would originate from a set of static IP address, which you can allowlist in your firewall. To allow a connection to connect through a firewall, you must do the following high-level steps:
Create a firewall, and route your egress traffic through the firewall.
Assign a static IP address to your connection.
Allowlist the assigned static IP address in your firewall.
Steps to create and configure a firewall are outside the scope of this page. This page only describes
how you can assign static IP addresses to your connections.
By default, Integration Connectors allocates IP addresses automatically. However, you can
configure Integration Connectors to generate static IP addresses instead of an automatic
IP addresses. Integration Connectors assigns the static IP addresses
at a region level. For example, the static IP addresses for the us-east1
region will be different from the static IP addresses in the us-west2 region.
To assign static IP addresses to your connection, do the following steps:
Get the region of the connection for which you want to allocate the static IP address.
You can view the connection region in the Location column of the Connections page.
Go to the Connections page
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Tip: Even though this step mentions to open a Cloud Shell, you can run the commands even
on your regular terminal, because you will be calling the Integration Connectors public APIs.
Configure the Integration Connectors to assign static IP address for the region
that you got from step 1. Run the following command in your Cloud Shell.
curl - X PATCH - H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
- H "Content-Type: application/json" \
- d '{ "networkConfig" : { "egressMode" : "static_ip" }}' \
https: //connectors.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /regionalSettings?updateMask="networkConfig"
Set the LOCATION to the region that you got in step 1.
Running this command, returns a response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/test-01/locations/us-central1/operations/ operation-1696840994443-6074494b6d138-8215226d-516faaf8 ",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.connectors.v1.OperationMetadata",
"createTime": "2023-10-09T08:43:14.467058513Z",
"target": "projects/test-01/locations/us-central1/regionalSettings",
"verb": "update",
"requestedCancellation": false,
"apiVersion": "v1"
},
"done": false
}
This command returns an operation ID and starts a long-running operation (LRO) which
may take some time to complete. Wait for the LRO to complete. You can track the progress of
the operation by using the following command:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https://connectors.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID
If the static IP address allocation is successful, you will get a response similar to the following:
...
...
"response": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.connectors.v1.RegionalSettings",
"name": "projects/test-01/locations/us-central1/regionalSettings",
"networkConfig": {
"egressMode": "STATIC_IP",
"egressIps": [
"35.193.227.203",
"34.133.63.9",
"35.223.253.58",
"34.170.27.253"
]
}
}
In this sample response, four static IP addresses are allocated for the us-central1
region, and the egressMode for the region is set to STATIC_IP .
Note: By default, Integration Connectors assigns
auto IP addresses for the connections, and not static IP addresses.
Allowlist the static IP addresses (got in step 4) in your firewall rules.
Get static IP addresses of a region
If at anytime you want to get the static IP addresses allocated to a region (location), run the following command:
curl - H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
- H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https: //connectors.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /regionalSettings
Running this command returns a response similar to the following:
"response": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.connectors.v1.RegionalSettings",
"name": "projects/test-01/locations/us-central1/regionalSettings",
"networkConfig": {
"egressMode": "STATIC_IP",
"egressIps": [
"35.193.227.203",
"34.133.63.9",
"35.223.253.58",
"34.170.27.253"
]
}
}
Assign auto IP addresses to a region
If you want to remove the static IP address configuration for a region, and auto assign the
IP addresses, you must run the following command in your terminal:
curl - X PATCH - H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
- H "Content-Type: application/json" \
- d '{ "networkConfig" : { "egressMode" : "auto_ip" }}' \
https: //connectors.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /regionalSettings?updateMask="networkConfig"
Similar to the previous command for configuring static IP addresses, this command also
returns an operation ID and starts a long-running operation (LRO) which may take some time to
complete. Wait for the LRO to complete.
Considerations
Consider the following points when allocating static IP addresses for a region:
The reserved set of static IP addresses are different for different regions within a project.
When you change the egress mode for a region from STATIC_IP to AUTO_IP , the original set of
static IP addresses aren't retained, and therefore, when you again change the egress mode from
AUTO_IP to STATIC_IP , a new set of static IP addresses are allocated.
When you change the egress mode from AUTO_IP to STATIC_IP or the other way around,
you can expect a downtime in the order of seconds.
