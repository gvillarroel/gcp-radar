Azure AD (Entra ID)
The Azure AD (Entra ID) connector lets you perform insert, delete, update, and read operations on Azure Active Directory.
Before you begin
Before using the Azure AD (Entra ID) connector, do the following tasks:
In your Google Cloud project:
Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see Network connectivity .
Grant the roles/connectors.admin IAM role to the user
configuring the connector.
Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector:
roles/secretmanager.viewer
roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human
user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs.
If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. The connector and the service account must belong to the same project. For more
information, see
Creating a service account .
Enable the following services:
secretmanager.googleapis.com (Secret Manager API)
connectors.googleapis.com (Connectors API)
To understand how to enable services, see Enabling services .
If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them
when configuring the connector.
Before you create an Azure AD (Entra ID) connection, create an application on Azure Portal/Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform and Register a client application in Microsoft Entra ID .
Configure the connector
A connection is specific to a data source. It
means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection
for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:
In the Cloud console , go to the Integration Connectors > Connections page
and then select or create a Google Cloud project.
Go to the Connections page
Click + Create new to open the Create Connection page.
In the Location section, choose the location for the connection.
Region : Select a location from the drop-down list.
Supported regions for connectors include:
For the list of all the supported regions, see Locations .
Click Next .
In the Connection Details section, complete the following:
Connector : Select Azure AD (Entra ID) from the drop down list of available Connectors.
Connector version : Select the Connector version from the drop down list of available versions.

Connection names must meet the following criteria:
Connection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
Letters must be lower-case.
Connection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
Connection names cannot exceed 49 characters.
Optionally, enter a Description for the connection instance.
Service Account : Select a service account that has the required roles .
Optionally, configure the Connection node settings :
Minimum number of nodes : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
Maximum number of nodes : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.
A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions.
More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely,
fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions.
To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see
Pricing for connection nodes . If you don't enter any values, by default
the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.
Note: You can customize the connection node values only if you are
a Pay-as-you-go customer.
To use the connection for event subscriptions, select Enable event subscription . Selecting
this, displays the following options:
Enable event subscription with entity and actions : Select this option to
use the connection for both event subscription and connector operations (entities and actions).
Enable only event subscription : Select this option to use the connection
only for event subscription. If you select this option, click Next , and then
configure event subscription .
Azure Tenant : The Microsoft Online tenant being used to access data. If not specified, your default tenant is used.
Fetch Extension Properties for Users : Determines whether to fetch extension properties .
Optionally, click + Add label to add a label to the Connection in the form of a key/value pair.
Click Next .

Optionally, select Enable data enrichment if you want additional information
to be appended to the backend system's response.
The additional information is specific to the entity for which you have configured the event. For more information,
see Data enrichment in event notifications .
Note: If you have configured this connection for only event subscription, you can't
enable this option. To enable data enrichment, you must configure the connection for
both event subscription and connector operations (entities and actions).
Select Enable private connectivity for secured connectivity between your backend application
and your connection. If you select this option, you must perform additional configuration steps
after creating the connection. For more information, see Private connectivity for event subscription .
Enter the dead-letter configuration. If you configure dead-letter, the connection writes
the unprocessed events to the specified Pub/Sub topic . Enter the following details:
Dead-letter project ID: The Google Cloud project ID where you have configured the dead-letter Pub/Sub topic.
Dead-letter topic: The Pub/Sub topic where you want to write the details of the unprocessed event.
If you want to use a proxy to connect to your backend (for event subscription), enter the following details:
Proxy SSL Type : The SSL type to use when connecting to the proxy server. Select any
of the following authentication types:
Always : The connection is always SSL enabled for event subscription.
Never : The connection is not SSL enabled for event subscription.

Tip: To understand how you can use event subscription in your
integrations, see Azure AD trigger .
Entities, operations, and actions
All the Integration Connectors provide a layer of abstraction for the objects of
the connected application. You can access an application's objects only through
this abstraction. The abstraction is exposed to you as entities, operations, and actions.
Note: You can view the entities, operations, and actions of a
connector in the Connectors task .
Entity: An entity can be thought of as an object, or a collection of properties, in the
connected application or service. The definition of an entity differs from a connector to a
connector. For example, in a database connector, tables are the entities, in a
file server connector, folders are the entities, and in a messaging system connector,
queues are the entities.
However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support or have any entities, in which case the
Entities list will be empty.
Operation: An operation is the activity that you can perform on an entity. You can perform
any of the following operations on an entity:
List
Get
Create
Update
Delete
Selecting an entity from the available list, generates a list of
operations available for the entity. For a detailed description of the operations, see the Connectors task's
entity operations .
However, if a connector doesn't support any of the entity operations, such unsupported
operations aren't listed in the Operations list.
Action: An action is a first class function that is made available to the integration
through the connector interface. An action lets you make changes to an entity or entities, and
vary from connector to connector. Normally, an action will have some input parameters, and an output
parameter. However, it is possible
that a connector doesn't support any action, in which case the Actions list will be empty.
Note: All entities and actions will have a schema associated with them. For example, an action schema will have the parameter details such as; the parameter
names, and its corresponding data type. The schema (metadata) for entities and actions is fetched by the connection at
runtime from your backend. If there are any updates to the schema, such updates won't be
automatically reflected in your existing connections; you must manually refresh the schema. To refresh
the schema for a connection, open the Connection details page of the connection, and then click
Refresh connection schema .
System limitations
The Azure AD (Entra ID) connector can process 5 transaction per second,
per node ,
and throttles any transactions
beyond this limit.
By default, Integration Connectors allocates 2 nodes (for better availability) for a connection.
For information on the limits applicable to Integration Connectors, see Limits .
Note: The number of Integration Connectors nodes will autoscale dynamically
based on your usage. However, if you want to reserve capacity for large volumes without
waiting for autoscaling, you can adjust the minimum node value for a connection. More
nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection. Conversely, fewer nodes
are required if a connection processes fewer transactions. To configure the node
values, do the following:
If you are a pay-as-you-go customer, configure the minimum and maximum node value
in the edit connection page.
If you are a subscription based
customer, contact support .
The maximum transactions that a node can handle depends on various factors. So, before adjusting the minimum nodes for better throughput,
it is recommended you check if your backend systems are set up optimally to handle the required traffic.

You can also perform LIST operations on the following entities:
User
GroupMembers
Domains
RoleAssignments
Applications
Devices
Contacts
DirectoryRoleTemplates
DirectoryRoles
AdministrativeUnits
SubscribedSKUs

Example - Get a single record from the group
In the Configure connector task dialog, click Entities .
Select Groups from the Entity list.
Select the GET operation, and then click
Done .
Set the entity ID to "bb4756c7-38c0-426b-97aa-03b6443e7f16" which is the Key to be passed. To set the entity ID, in
the Data Mapper section of the Data Mapping , click Open Data Mapping Editor and
then enter "bb4756c7-38c0-426b-97aa-03b6443e7f16" in the Input Value field and choose the EntityId as Local variable.
Note:
You must pass the Entity ID value directly, such as, "bb4756c7-38c0-426b-97aa-03b6443e7f16". Here "bb4756c7-38c0-426b-97aa-03b6443e7f16" is the unique primary key value.
If two composite keys are present, then passing a Entity Id might throw an error.
In such cases, you can use the filter clause, such as,id='bb4756c7-38c0-426b-97aa-03b6443e7f16'.
