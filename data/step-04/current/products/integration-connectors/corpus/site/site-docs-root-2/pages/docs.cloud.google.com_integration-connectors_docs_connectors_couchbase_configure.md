Couchbase
The Couchbase connector lets you connect to a Couchbase database instance and perform the supported database operations.
Supported versions
Couchbase Server versions 4.0 and up (Enterprise Edition or Community Edition).
Couchbase Capella
Before you begin
Before using the Couchbase connector, do the following tasks:
In your Google Cloud project:
Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see Network connectivity .
Grant the roles/connectors.admin IAM role to the user
configuring the connector.
Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector:
roles/secretmanager.viewer
roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human
user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs.
If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. The connector and the service account must belong to the same project. For more
information, see
Creating a service account .
Enable the following services:
secretmanager.googleapis.com (Secret Manager API)
connectors.googleapis.com (Connectors API)
To understand how to enable services, see Enabling services .
If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them
when configuring the connector.
If required, create a Couchbase server. For more information,
see Quickstart Couchbase Server .
For information about Couchbase APIs, see Couchbase REST API Doc .
If required, download the SSL certificate. For more information, see Secure Connection with TLS .
Configure the connector
A connection is specific to a data source. It
means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection
for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:
In the Cloud console , go to the Integration Connectors > Connections page
and then select or create a Google Cloud project.
Go to the Connections page
Click + CREATE NEW to open the Create Connection page.
In the Location section, choose the location for the connection.
Region : Select a location from the drop-down list.
For the list of all the supported regions, see Locations .
Click NEXT .
In the Connection Details section, complete the following:
Connector : Select Couchbase from the drop down list of available Connectors.
Connector version : Select the Connector version from the drop down list of available versions.
In the Connection Name field, enter a name for the Connection instance.
Connection names must meet the following criteria:
Connection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
Letters must be lower-case.
Connection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
Connection names cannot exceed 49 characters.
Optionally, enter a Description for the connection instance.
Optionally, enable Cloud logging ,
and then select a log level. By default, the log level is set to Error .
Service Account : Select a service account that has the required roles .
Optionally, configure the Connection node settings :
Minimum number of nodes : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
Maximum number of nodes : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.
A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions.
More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely,
fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions.
To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see
Pricing for connection nodes . If you don't enter any values, by default
the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.
Note: You can customize the connection node values only if you are
a Pay-as-you-go customer.
Allow JSON Parameters : Allows raw JSON to be used in parameters when QueryPassthrough is enabled.
Analytics Port : The port for connecting to the Couchbase Analytics Endpoint.
Child Separator : The character or characters used to denote child tables.
Couchbase Service : Determines the Couchbase service to connect to. Default is N1QL. Available options are N1QL and Analytics.
Create Table Ram Quota : The default RAM quota, in megabytes, to use when inserting buckets via the CREATE TABLE syntax.
Dataverse Separator : The character or characters used to denote Analytics dataverses and scopes/collections.
Flavor Separator : The character or characters used to denote flavors.
N1QL Port : The port for connecting to the Couchbase N1QL Endpoint.
Periods Separator : The character or characters used to denote hierarchy.
Query Execution Timeout : This sets the server-side timeout for the query, which governs how long Couchbase will execute the query before returning a timeout error.
Strict Comparison : Adjusts how precisely to translate filters on SQL input queries into Couchbase queries. This can be set to a comma-separated list of values, where each value can be one of: date, number, boolean, or string.
Transaction Durability : Specifies how a document must be stored for a transaction to succeed. Specifies whether to use N1QL transactions when executing queries.
Transaction Timeout : This sets the amount of time a transaction may execute before it is timed out by Couchbase.
Use Collections For DDL : Whether to assume that CREATE TABLE statements use collections instead of flavors. Only takes effect when connecting to Couchbase v7+ and GenerateSchemaFiles is set to OnCreate.
Use Transactions : Specifies whether to use N1QL transactions when executing queries.
Validate JSON Parameters : Allows the provider to validate that string parameters are valid JSON before sending the query to Couchbase.
(Optional) In the Advanced settings section, select the Use proxy checkbox to configure a proxy server for the connection and configure the following values:

Entities, operations, and actions
All the Integration Connectors provide a layer of abstraction for the objects of
the connected application. You can access an application's objects only through
this abstraction. The abstraction is exposed to you as entities, operations, and actions.
Note: You can view the entities, operations, and actions of a
connector in the Connectors task .
Entity: An entity can be thought of as an object, or a collection of properties, in the
connected application or service. The definition of an entity differs from a connector to a
connector. For example, in a database connector, tables are the entities, in a
file server connector, folders are the entities, and in a messaging system connector,
queues are the entities.
However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support or have any entities, in which case the
Entities list will be empty.
Operation: An operation is the activity that you can perform on an entity. You can perform
any of the following operations on an entity:
List
Get
Create
Update
Delete
Selecting an entity from the available list, generates a list of
operations available for the entity. For a detailed description of the operations, see the Connectors task's
entity operations .
However, if a connector doesn't support any of the entity operations, such unsupported
operations aren't listed in the Operations list.
Action: An action is a first class function that is made available to the integration
through the connector interface. An action lets you make changes to an entity or entities, and
vary from connector to connector. Normally, an action will have some input parameters, and an output
parameter. However, it is possible
that a connector doesn't support any action, in which case the Actions list will be empty.
Note: All entities and actions will have a schema associated with them. For example, an action schema will have the parameter details such as; the parameter
names, and its corresponding data type. The schema (metadata) for entities and actions is fetched by the connection at
runtime from your backend. If there are any updates to the schema, such updates won't be
automatically reflected in your existing connections; you must manually refresh the schema. To refresh
the schema for a connection, open the Connection details page of the connection, and then click
Refresh connection schema .
Actions
This connector supports execution of the following actions:
User-defined stored procedures and functions. If you have any stored procedures and functions in your backend, those are listed
in the Actions column of the Configure connector task dialog.
Custom SQL queries. To execute custom SQL queries, the connector provides the Execute custom query action.
To create a custom query, follow these steps:
Follow the detailed instructions to add a connectors task .
When you configure the connector task , in the type of action you want to perform, select Actions .
In the Action list, select Execute custom query , and then click Done .
Expand the Task input section, and then do the following:
In the Timeout after field, enter the number of seconds to wait till the query executes. Default value: 180 seconds.
In the Maximum number of rows field, enter the maximum number of rows to be returned from the database. Default value: 25 .
To update the custom query, click Edit Custom Script . The Script editor dialog opens.
In the Script editor dialog, enter the SQL query and click Save .
You can use a question mark (?) in a SQL statement to represent a single parameter that must be specified in the query parameters list. For example, the following SQL query selects all rows from the Employees table that matches the values specified for the LastName column:
SELECT * FROM Employees where LastName=?
Note: Data manipulation language (DML) and data definition language (DDL) statements are supported.
If you've used question marks in your SQL query, you must add the parameter by clicking + Add Parameter Name for each question mark. While executing the integration, these parameters replace the question marks (?) in the SQL query sequentially. For example, if you have added three question marks (?), then you must add three parameters in order of sequence.
To add query parameters, do the following:
From the Type list, select the data type of the parameter.
In the Value field, enter the value of the parameter.
To add multiple parameters, click + Add Query Parameter .
The Execute custom query action does not support array variables.
System limitations
The Couchbase connector can process 25 transactions per second,
per node ,
and throttles any transactions
beyond this limit.
By default, Integration Connectors allocates 2 nodes (for better availability) for a connection.
For information on the limits applicable to Integration Connectors, see Limits .
Note: The number of Integration Connectors nodes will autoscale dynamically
based on your usage. However, if you want to reserve capacity for large volumes without
waiting for autoscaling, you can adjust the minimum node value for a connection. More
nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection. Conversely, fewer nodes
are required if a connection processes fewer transactions. To configure the node
values, do the following:
If you are a pay-as-you-go customer, configure the minimum and maximum node value
in the edit connection page.
If you are a subscription based
customer, contact support .
The maximum transactions that a node can handle depends on various factors. So, before adjusting the minimum nodes for better throughput,
it is recommended you check if your backend systems are set up optimally to handle the required traffic.
