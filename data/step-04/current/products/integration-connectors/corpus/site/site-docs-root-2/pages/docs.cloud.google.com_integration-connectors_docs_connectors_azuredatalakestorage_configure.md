Azure Data Lake Storage
The Azure Data Lake Storage connector lets you connect to Azure Data Lake Storage and use SQL to retrieve and update the Azure Data Lake Storage data.
Before you begin
Before using the Azure Data Lake Storage connector, do the following tasks:
In your Google Cloud project:
Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see Network connectivity .
Grant the roles/connectors.admin IAM role to the user
configuring the connector.
Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector:
roles/secretmanager.viewer
roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human
user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs.
If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. The connector and the service account must belong to the same project. For more
information, see
Creating a service account .
Enable the following services:
secretmanager.googleapis.com (Secret Manager API)
connectors.googleapis.com (Connectors API)
To understand how to enable services, see Enabling services .
If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them
when configuring the connector.
For information about how to create an Azure storage account, see Create a storage account . For information about creating a container in Azure, see Create a container . For information about creating a directory in Azure, see Create a directory .
Configure the connector
A connection is specific to a data source. It
means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection
for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:
In the Cloud console , go to the Integration Connectors > Connections page
and then select or create a Google Cloud project.
Go to the Connections page
Click + Create new to open the Create Connection page.
In the Location section, choose the location for the connection.
Region : Select a location from the drop-down list.
Supported regions for connectors include:
For the list of all the supported regions, see Locations .
Click Next .
In the Connection Details section, complete the following:
Connector : Select Azure Data Lake Storage from the drop down list of available Connectors.
Connector version : Select the Connector version from the drop down list of available versions.
In the Connection Name field, enter a name for the Connection instance.
Connection names must meet the following criteria:
Connection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
Letters must be lower-case.
Connection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
Connection names cannot exceed 49 characters.
Optionally, enter a Description for the connection instance.
Optionally, enable Cloud logging ,
and then select a log level. By default, the log level is set to Error .
Service Account : Select a service account that has the required roles .
Optionally, configure the Connection node settings :
Minimum number of nodes : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
Maximum number of nodes : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.
A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions.
More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely,
fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions.
To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see
Pricing for connection nodes . If you don't enter any values, by default
the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.
Note: You can customize the connection node values only if you are
a Pay-as-you-go customer.
Account : This property specifies the name of the Azure Data Lake Storage account.
Directory : This property specifies the root path to list files and folders.
File System : This property specifies the name of the FileSystem which will be used in a Gen 2 storage account. For Example, the name of your Azure blob container.
Chunk Size : The size of chunks (in Mb) to use when uploading large files.
Include Sub Directories : Choose if the sub directories paths should be listed in the Resources view in the ADLSGen2 Schema.
Optionally, click + Add label to add a label to the Connection in the form of a key/value pair.
Click Next .
In the Authentication section, enter the authentication details.
Select an Authentication type and enter the relevant details.
The following authentication types are supported by the Azure Data Lake Storage connection:
Shared Access Signature
Account Access Key
JWT Authentication
To understand how to configure these authentication types, see Configure authentication .
Click Next .
Review : Review your connection and authentication details.
Click Create .
Configure authentication
Enter the details based on the authentication you want to use.
Shared Access Signature
Shared Access Signature : Secret Manager Secret containing the Shared Access Signature.
Account Access Key
Account Access Key : Secret Manager Secret containing the Account Access Key.
JWT Authentication
Client ID : The client ID used for requesting access tokens.
Private Key : Secret Manager Secret containing the contents of the private key file in PEM format. The private key must match the public key/certificate.
Private Key Password : Secret Manager Secret containing the password (paraphrase) of the private key file.

Entities, operations, and actions
All the Integration Connectors provide a layer of abstraction for the objects of
the connected application. You can access an application's objects only through
this abstraction. The abstraction is exposed to you as entities, operations, and actions.
Note: You can view the entities, operations, and actions of a
connector in the Connectors task .
Entity: An entity can be thought of as an object, or a collection of properties, in the
connected application or service. The definition of an entity differs from a connector to a
connector. For example, in a database connector, tables are the entities, in a
file server connector, folders are the entities, and in a messaging system connector,
queues are the entities.
However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support or have any entities, in which case the
Entities list will be empty.
Operation: An operation is the activity that you can perform on an entity. You can perform
any of the following operations on an entity:
List
Get
Create
Update
Delete
Selecting an entity from the available list, generates a list of
operations available for the entity. For a detailed description of the operations, see the Connectors task's
entity operations .
However, if a connector doesn't support any of the entity operations, such unsupported
operations aren't listed in the Operations list.
Action: An action is a first class function that is made available to the integration
through the connector interface. An action lets you make changes to an entity or entities, and
vary from connector to connector. Normally, an action will have some input parameters, and an output
parameter. However, it is possible
that a connector doesn't support any action, in which case the Actions list will be empty.
Note: All entities and actions will have a schema associated with them. For example, an action schema will have the parameter details such as; the parameter
names, and its corresponding data type. The schema (metadata) for entities and actions is fetched by the connection at
runtime from your backend. If there are any updates to the schema, such updates won't be
automatically reflected in your existing connections; you must manually refresh the schema. To refresh
the schema for a connection, open the Connection details page of the connection, and then click
Refresh connection schema .
System limitations
The Azure Data Lake Storage connector can process 5 transactions per second,
per node ,
and throttles any transactions
beyond this limit.
By default, Integration Connectors allocates 2 nodes (for better availability) for a connection.
For information on the limits applicable to Integration Connectors, see Limits .
Note: The number of Integration Connectors nodes will autoscale dynamically
based on your usage. However, if you want to reserve capacity for large volumes without
waiting for autoscaling, you can adjust the minimum node value for a connection. More
nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection. Conversely, fewer nodes
are required if a connection processes fewer transactions. To configure the node
values, do the following:
If you are a pay-as-you-go customer, configure the minimum and maximum node value
in the edit connection page.
If you are a subscription based
customer, contact support .
The maximum transactions that a node can handle depends on various factors. So, before adjusting the minimum nodes for better throughput,
it is recommended you check if your backend systems are set up optimally to handle the required traffic.
Actions
This section lists the actions supported by the connector. To understand how to configure the
actions, see Action examples .
Note: The results of all the actions will be available as a
JSON response in the Connectors task's connectorOutputPayload
response parameter after you run your integration.
