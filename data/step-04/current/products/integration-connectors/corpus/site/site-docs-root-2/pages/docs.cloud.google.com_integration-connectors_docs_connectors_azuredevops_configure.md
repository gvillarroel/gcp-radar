Azure DevOps
The Azure DevOps connector lets you perform insert, delete, update, and read operations on Azure DevOps data.
Supported versions
This connector supports the following Azure DevOps versions.
Azure DevOps 2022, 2020, 2019
Team Foundation Server 2018
Before you begin
In your Google Cloud project, do the following tasks:
Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see Network connectivity .
Grant the roles/connectors.admin IAM role to the user configuring the connector.
Grant the roles/secretmanager.viewer and roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector.
Enable the following services:
secretmanager.googleapis.com (Secret Manager API)
connectors.googleapis.com (Connectors API)
To understand how to enable services, see Enabling services . If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them when you configure the connector.
Configure the connector
A connection is specific to a data source. It
means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection
for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:

Connection configuration samples
This section lists the sample values for the various
fields that you configure when creating the connection.
In Azure DevOps, various data schemas are used to organize and manage different aspects of a project.
Each schema focuses on a specific type of data to structure information effectively based on the project needs.
Project data model: A schema that defines how project related data, such as items, repositories, pipelines, and teams are organized, linked, and managed within Azure DevOps.
Information data model: A schema that defines how documentation, metadata, and communication artifacts are structured, stored, and accessed across Azure DevOps projects.
Repository data model: A schema that defines how code repositories, branches, commits, pull requests, and related metadata are organized and managed within Azure DevOps.
Analytics data model: A schema that captures and organizes historical and real time data from Azure DevOps for reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics.
All data models: A single connection that provides access to all data models in a single connection.

You can use the following connection properties to manage data fetched from Azure DevOps.
Catalog
This property specifies the name or ID of the project you want to connect to. To obtain a list of project IDs and names, execute a SELECT query against the Projects table.
To query data for a specific project, set Catalog to the project name or its ID in the format Project_projectname.
If the project name is dev with the ID 2ee729d6-804d-4ece-84af-d5befa94abe8 , set Catalog to either Project_dev or Project_2ee729d6-804d-4ece-84af-d5befa94abe8 .
To query data that is independent of a specific project, set Catalog to Devops .
If the catalog name is Devops , you can use any name in place of Devops .
Schema
This property specifies the schema to use, available schemas depend on the repository specified. To obtain a list of repository IDs and names, execute a SELECT query against the Repositories table.
If you set Catalog and Schema to INFORMATION in the connection configuration, you will only have access to the Information Data Model schema. Other project catalogs or schemas will not be exposed.
If Catalog is set to a project catalog, you can set Schema to one of the following: Analytics , Project , or one of the repository schemas.
Once you select the appropriate schema, you can query data within a specific repository.
To query data from a repository with the ID 3ee729d6-804d-4ece-84af-d5befa94abe8 , set Catalog to Repository_3ee729d6-804d-4ece-84af-d5befa94abe8 .
To create an application on Azure Portal/MS Entra and utilise all the parameters of the created application at Azure AD Connection level, see
Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform
and Register a client application in Microsoft Entra ID .
System limitations
The Azure DevOps connector can process a maximum of 6 transactions per second,
per node , and throttles any transactions beyond this limit.
By default, Integration Connectors allocates 2 nodes (for better availability) for a connection.
For information on the limits applicable to Integration Connectors, see Limits .
Note: The number of Integration Connectors nodes will autoscale dynamically
based on your usage. However, if you want to reserve capacity for large volumes without
waiting for autoscaling, you can adjust the minimum node value for a connection. More
nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection. Conversely, fewer nodes
are required if a connection processes fewer transactions. To configure the node
values, do the following:
If you are a pay-as-you-go customer, configure the minimum and maximum node value
in the edit connection page.
If you are a subscription based
customer, contact support .
The maximum transactions that a node can handle depends on various factors. So, before adjusting the minimum nodes for better throughput,
it is recommended you check if your backend systems are set up optimally to handle the required traffic.
Use the Azure DevOps connection in an integration
After you create the connection, it becomes available in both
Apigee Integration and Application Integration. You can use the connection
in an integration through the Connectors task.
To understand how to create and use the Connectors task in Apigee Integration, see Connectors task .
To understand how to create and use the Connectors task in Application Integration, see Connectors task .

Task Input section of the Connectors task, you can set the
filterClause as per the customer requirement. Please check the Note section below
The value for filterClause should be always passed within the single quotes (') in this format.
You can use the filterClause for filtering our certain set of records based on any columns.
Example - Retrieve a single dashboard using its ID
In the Configure connector task dialog, click Entities .
Select Dashboards from the Entity list.
Select the Get operation, and then click
Done .
Set the entity ID to "2f671e29-e48f-4d26-8869-859e154b5f20" which is the Key to be passed. To set the entity ID, in
the Data Mapper section of the Data Mapping , click Open Data Mapping Editor and
