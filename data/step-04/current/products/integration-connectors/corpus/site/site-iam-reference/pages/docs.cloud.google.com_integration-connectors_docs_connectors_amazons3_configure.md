Amazon S3
The Amazon S3 connector provides SQL access to Amazon S3 Buckets and objects.
Before you begin
Before using the Amazon S3 connector, do the following tasks:
In your Google Cloud project:
Ensure that network connectivity is set up. For information about network patterns, see Network connectivity .
Grant the roles/connectors.admin IAM role to the user
configuring the connector.
Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use for the connector:
roles/secretmanager.viewer
roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human
user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs.
If you don't have a service account, you must create a service account. The connector and the service account must belong to the same project. For more
information, see
Creating a service account .
Enable the following services:
secretmanager.googleapis.com (Secret Manager API)
connectors.googleapis.com (Connectors API)
To understand how to enable services, see Enabling services .
If these services or permissions have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them
when configuring the connector.
Configure the connector
A connection is specific to a data source. It
means that if you have many data sources, you must create a separate connection
for each data source. To create a connection, do the following:
In the Cloud console , go to the Integration Connectors > Connections page
and then select or create a Google Cloud project.
Go to the Connections page
Click + Create new to open the Create Connection page.
In the Location section, choose the location for the connection.
Region : Select a location from the drop-down list.
Supported regions for connectors include:
For the list of all the supported regions, see Locations .
Click Next .
In the Connection Details section, complete the following:
Connector : Select Amazon S3 from the drop down list of available Connectors.
Connector version : Select the Connector version from the drop down list of available versions.
In the Connection Name field, enter a name for the Connection instance.
Connection names must meet the following criteria:
Connection names can use letters, numbers, or hyphens.
Letters must be lower-case.
Connection names must begin with a letter and end with a letter or number.
Connection names cannot exceed 49 characters.
Optionally, enter a Description for the connection instance.
Optionally, enable Cloud logging ,
and then select a log level. By default, the log level is set to Error .
Service Account : Select a service account that has the required roles .
Optionally, configure the Connection node settings :
Minimum number of nodes : Enter the minimum number of connection nodes.
Maximum number of nodes : Enter the maximum number of connection nodes.
A node is a unit (or replica) of a connection that processes transactions.
More nodes are required to process more transactions for a connection and conversely,
fewer nodes are required to process fewer transactions.
To understand how the nodes affect your connector pricing, see
Pricing for connection nodes . If you don't enter any values, by default
the minimum nodes are set to 2 (for better availability) and the maximum nodes are set to 50.
Note: You can customize the connection node values only if you are
a Pay-as-you-go customer.
AWS Region : Region where your Amazon S3 instance is hosted
Optionally, click + Add label to add a label to the Connection in the form of a key/value pair.
Click Next .
In the Destinations section, enter details of the remote host (backend system) you want to connect to.
Destination Type : Select a Destination Type .
To specify the destination hostname or IP address, select Host address and
enter the address in the Host 1 field.
To establish a private connection, select Host Address and add the endpoint attachment created for the SAP Gateway using the HTTPS protocol.
Note: To understand how to create an endpoint attachment, see
PSC service attachment
and endpoint attachment . After you
have created the endpoint attachment, it will be visible in the Endpoint Attachment list.
If you want to establish a public connection to your backend systems with additional security, you can
consider configuring static outbound
IP addresses for your connections , and then configure
your firewall rules to allowlist only the specific static IP addresses.
To enter additional destinations, click +Add destination .
Click Next .
In the Authentication section, enter the authentication details.
Select an Authentication type and enter the relevant details.
The following authentication types are supported by the Amazon S3 connection:
Root credentials
AWS IAM Roles
AWS Temporary Credentials
To understand how to configure these authentication types, see Configure authentication .
Click Next .
Review : Review your connection and authentication details.
Click Create .
Configure authentication
Enter the details based on the authentication you want to use.
Root credentials
To authenticate using account root credentials.
AWS Access Key : The access key of the root user
AWS Access Secret : The secret key of the root user
AWS IAM Roles
To authenticate using an AWS IAM role.
AWS Access Key : The access key of the IAM user to assume the role for
AWS Access Secret : The secret key of the IAM user to assume the role for
AWS Role ARN : Specify the Role ARN for the role you'd like to authenticate with. Only credentials for the specified role would be retrieved.
AWS External Id : Required only when you assume a role in another account.
AWS Temporary Credentials
To authenticate using temporary credentials
AWS Access Key : The access key of the IAM user to assume the role for
AWS Access Secret : The secret key of the IAM user to assume the role for
AWS Session Token : This is generated alonside the temporary credentials.
AWS Role ARN : Specify the Role ARN for the role you'd like to authenticate with. Only credentials for the specified role would be retrieved.
AWS External Id : Required only when you assume a role in another account.
For information about how to set up an AWS account, see Setting up Amazon S3 .
For information about how to create an S3 bucket, see Create an S3 bucket .
Contact your AWS administrator to create AWS IAM role credentials or AWS temporary credentials in the AWS account.

Entities, operations, and actions
All the Integration Connectors provide a layer of abstraction for the objects of
the connected application. You can access an application's objects only through
this abstraction. The abstraction is exposed to you as entities, operations, and actions.
Note: You can view the entities, operations, and actions of a
connector in the Connectors task .
Entity: An entity can be thought of as an object, or a collection of properties, in the
connected application or service. The definition of an entity differs from a connector to a
connector. For example, in a database connector, tables are the entities, in a
file server connector, folders are the entities, and in a messaging system connector,
queues are the entities.
However, it is possible that a connector doesn't support or have any entities, in which case the
Entities list will be empty.
Operation: An operation is the activity that you can perform on an entity. You can perform
any of the following operations on an entity:
List
Get
Create
Update
Delete
Selecting an entity from the available list, generates a list of
operations available for the entity. For a detailed description of the operations, see the Connectors task's
entity operations .
However, if a connector doesn't support any of the entity operations, such unsupported
operations aren't listed in the Operations list.
Action: An action is a first class function that is made available to the integration
through the connector interface. An action lets you make changes to an entity or entities, and
vary from connector to connector. Normally, an action will have some input parameters, and an output
parameter. However, it is possible
that a connector doesn't support any action, in which case the Actions list will be empty.
Note: All entities and actions will have a schema associated with them. For example, an action schema will have the parameter details such as; the parameter
names, and its corresponding data type. The schema (metadata) for entities and actions is fetched by the connection at
runtime from your backend. If there are any updates to the schema, such updates won't be
automatically reflected in your existing connections; you must manually refresh the schema. To refresh
the schema for a connection, open the Connection details page of the connection, and then click
Refresh connection schema .
Actions
This section lists some of the actions supported by the connector. To understand how to configure the
actions, see Action examples .
Note: The results of all the actions will be available as a
JSON response in the Connectors task's connectorOutputPayload
response parameter after you run your integration.
