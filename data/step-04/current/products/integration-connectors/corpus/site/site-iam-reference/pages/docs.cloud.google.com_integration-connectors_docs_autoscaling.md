About autoscaling in Integration Connectors
This page describes autoscaling behavior in Integration Connectors.
Integration Connectors, built on the same underlying infrastructure as some of Google Cloud's largest-scale services, offers autoscaling capabilities. This allows Integration Connectors to automatically scale the number of nodes based on the number of connections and the number of transactions that the nodes process.
How autoscaling works in Integration Connectors
Integration Connectors automatically scales the number of Integration Connectors nodes based on your usage. To reserve capacity and bypass automatic scaling, adjust the minimum number of nodes for a connection. A connection processing more transactions needs more nodes. A connection processing fewer transactions needs fewer nodes. To configure the node values:
If you are a pay-as-you-go customer, configure the minimum and maximum node values when you create or edit a connection.
If you have a subscription, contact support .
The maximum transactions that a node can handle depends on various factors. Before increasing the minimum number of nodes to improve throughput, ensure your backend systems can handle the increased traffic.
Integration Connectors adheres to defined quotas and limits, which you can request increases for. For more details, see the Limits documentation.
Monitor Integration Connectors Usage
Integration Connectors automatically exports metrics to Cloud Monitoring. These metrics provide insights into connection usage, performance, and health. Use these metrics to understand and optimize autoscaling behavior. The following table lists Integration Connectors metrics for monitoring connection usage and health:
Metric name
Description
Connection state
The current state of your connections, such as active or inactive.
Request count
The number of requests made through your connections.
Active nodes
The number of active nodes for your connections.
Connection status
The detailed status of individual connections.
For more information, see Monitor connectors .
