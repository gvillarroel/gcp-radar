Search for resources
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can search for resources in a project, folder, or organization, and filter
the returned results using a query.
Before you begin
Enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API in the project you're running Cloud Asset Inventory commands
from.
Enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API
Make sure your account has the
correct role to call the Cloud Asset Inventory API .
For individual permissions for each call type, see
Permissions .
Construct a query
Before constructing a query, it can be useful to start with a search request
that doesn't specify a query. Use the fields and values from the full response
to create a query using the
search query syntax , and refine it
until the results you want are returned.
Fields that can be used in a query are detailed in the
searchAllResources reference documentation .
Not all resources can be searched. See
Resource types
for resource names and to check if they are available to the search APIs.
Search for your resources
Console
To search for resource metadata, complete the following steps.
Go to the Asset Inventory page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to Asset Inventory
Change to the project, folder, or organization you want to search.
Click the Resource tab.
To search resources, enter a query in the Filter field. See
Search query syntax to learn how to write a search query.
To make constructing queries easier, you can click the Filter
field to display and add the available searchable fields to your
query.
After performing a search, the resources matching the query are listed in
the Results table. Double-click your query to edit it, or use the
Filter results pane to restrict the search results by specific
criteria.
To view the query as a Google Cloud CLI command, click
View query .
To export the results, click Download CSV .
gcloud
gcloud asset search-all-resources \
--scope = SCOPE_PATH \
--query = " QUERY " \
--asset-types = ASSET_TYPE_1 , ASSET_TYPE_2 ,... \
--order-by = " ORDER_BY " \
--read-mask = " READ_MASK " Provide the following values:
SCOPE_PATH : Use one of the following values:
The allowed values are:
projects/ PROJECT_ID , where PROJECT_ID is the
ID of the project that has the assets you want to search for.
projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER , where
PROJECT_NUMBER is the number of the project that has the assets you want to search for.
How to find a Google Cloud project number
Google Cloud console
To find a Google Cloud project number, complete the following steps:
Go to the Welcome page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Welcome
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box, and then search for your project name.
The project name, project number, and project ID are shown near the Welcome
heading.
Up to 4,000 resources are displayed. If you don't see the project you're looking for,
go to the
Manage resources page and
filter the list using the name of that project.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve a Google Cloud project number with the following command:
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID --format = "value(projectNumber)"
folders/ FOLDER_ID , where FOLDER_ID is the
ID of the folder that has the assets you want to search for.
How to find the ID of a Google Cloud folder
Google Cloud console
To find the ID of a Google Cloud folder, complete the following steps:
Go to the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Google Cloud console
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box.
Search for your folder name. The folder ID is shown next to the folder name.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve the ID of a Google Cloud folder that's located at the organization level with the following command:
gcloud resource-manager folders list \
--organization = $( gcloud organizations describe ORGANIZATION_NAME \
--format = "value(name.segment(1))" ) \
--filter = '"DISPLAY_NAME":" TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME "' \
--format = "value(ID)"
Where TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME is a partial or full string match for the
folder's name. Remove the --format flag to see more information about the
found folders.
The previous command doesn't return the IDs of subfolders within folders. To do so,
run the following command using a top level folder's ID:
gcloud resource-manager folders list --folder = FOLDER_ID
organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID , where
ORGANIZATION_ID is the ID of the organization that has the assets you want to search for.
How to find the ID of a Google Cloud organization
Google Cloud console
To find the ID of a Google Cloud organization, complete the following steps:
Go to the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Google Cloud console
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box.
Click the All tab. The organization ID is shown next to the organization name.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve the ID of a Google Cloud organization with the following command:
gcloud organizations describe ORGANIZATION_NAME --format = "value(name.segment(1))"
QUERY : Optional. The query expression. If not specified or
empty, all resources are searched for in the specified scope. To learn how to write a search
query, see Search query syntax .
ASSET_TYPE_# : Optional. A comma-separated list of
searchable asset types .
RE2-compatible regular expressions are supported. If the regular expression doesn't match
any supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. When
--asset-types isn't specified, all asset types are returned.
ORDER_BY : Optional. A comma-separated list of fields
specifying the sorting order of the results. The default order is ascending. Add
DESC after the field name to indicate descending order. See the
reference documentation for what fields can be sorted.
READ_MASK : Optional. A
comma-separated list of fields specifying which fields to be returned in the results. See thefor the fields that are returned by default, and other conditions to keep in mind when
specifying a read mask.
You can use the --format and
--flatten flags to format the
gcloud CLI output.
See the gcloud CLI reference for
all options.
Example
Run the following command to get a list of all the Compute Engine instances in the
my-project project with the word instance followed by a 1
in their full resource name . The results are in
descending order by name, and because of the read mask, only the name and
location fields are returned.
gcloud asset search-all-resources \
--scope = projects/ my-project \
--query = "name:instance 1" \
--asset-types = compute.googleapis.com/Instance \
