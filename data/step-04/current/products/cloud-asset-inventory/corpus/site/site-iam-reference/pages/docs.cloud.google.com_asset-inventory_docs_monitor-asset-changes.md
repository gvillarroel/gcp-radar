Monitor asset changes with Pub/Sub
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can receive real-time notifications about resource and policy changes by
creating and subscribing to a feed.
When you create the feed, you can specify that you want to monitor changes of
supported resource types, IAM policies, access policies, and
organization policies in an organization, folder, project. Additionally, you can
add conditions to your feed so that you only receive
notifications for certain types of changes to an asset.
After creating a feed, you receive notifications through
Pub/Sub whenever the specified assets change. The
first message published to the Pub/Sub topic is a welcome message in the
format of a string, and all following messages are in the format of a
TemporalAsset .
Here's a sample Pub/Sub message for the RESOURCE content type.
{
"asset" :{
"ancestors" :[
"projects/000000000000" ,
"folders/000000000000" ,

}
}
To learn more about Pub/Sub or how to set up subscriptions, see the
Pub/Sub documentation .
Tip: You can connect real-time notifications to your workloads. For example, you
could run a Cloud Run function to reverse a resource change after it has
been detected.
Before you begin
Enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API in the project you're running Cloud Asset Inventory commands
from.
Enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API
Make sure your account has the
correct role to call the Cloud Asset Inventory API .
For individual permissions for each call type, see
Permissions .
Create a Pub/Sub topic , if you don't
have one already.
Limitations
It can take up to 10 minutes for any feed creation, update, or deletion to
take effect.
The project where a feed is created must outlive the feed. This is because
the service account used to publish to the destination Pub/Sub topic
is located in that project. A feed no longer functions and is deleted as soon
as project deletion is permanent.
You can create up to 200 feeds on a parent. This limit only applies to feeds
directly following a parent and does not count the feeds of its children. For
example, if you have 10 projects in an organization, each project can have up
to 200 feeds, and the organization can also have up to 200 feeds.

--organization = $( gcloud organizations describe ORGANIZATION_NAME \
--format = "value(name.segment(1))" ) \
--filter = '"DISPLAY_NAME":" TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME "' \
--format = "value(ID)"
Where TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME is a partial or full string match for the
folder's name. Remove the --format flag to see more information about the
found folders.
The previous command doesn't return the IDs of subfolders within folders. To do so,
run the following command using a top level folder's ID:
gcloud resource-manager folders list --folder = FOLDER_ID
organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID , where
ORGANIZATION_ID is the ID of the organization to update the feed in.
How to find the ID of a Google Cloud organization
Google Cloud console
To find the ID of a Google Cloud organization, complete the following steps:
Go to the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Google Cloud console
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box.
Click the All tab. The organization ID is shown next to the organization name.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve the ID of a Google Cloud organization with the following command:
gcloud organizations describe ORGANIZATION_NAME --format = "value(name.segment(1))"
BILLING_PROJECT_ID : The project ID that the
default Cloud Asset Inventory service agent is in that has permissions to manage your
Pub/Sub topic.
Read more about setting the billing project .
FEED_ID : A unique asset feed identifier.
At least one of the following asset definitions:
ASSET_NAME_# : Optional. An array of asset full names .
ASSET_TYPE_# : Optional. An array of
searchable asset types .
RE2-compatible regular expressions are supported. If the regular expression doesn't match
any supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. When
assetTypes isn't specified, all asset types are returned.
CONTENT_TYPE : Optional. The
content type of the metadata that you want to retrieve. When contentType isn't specified, only basic information is returned, such as asset names, the last time the
assets were updated, and what projects, folders, and organizations they belong to.
RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_# : Optional. Requires access to the
Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier . A comma-separated list of
asset relationship types that you want to
retrieve. You must set CONTENT_TYPE to RELATIONSHIP for
this to work.
TOPIC_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project where the
Pub/Sub topic is located.
TOPIC_ID : The ID of the Pub/Sub topic to
publish notifications to.
If adding an optional feed condition , include the following details
in your command:
CONDITION_TITLE : A title to assign to the feed condition.
CONDITION_DESCRIPTION : A description to assign to the feed
condition.
CONDITION_EXPRESSION : The condition expression to apply to the
feed.
See the REST reference for all
options.

Feed conditions
To view only certain types of changes for a given asset, you can add a condition
to your feed. Conditions are written in
Common Expression Language (CEL) .
Support for conditions is limited. In some cases, creating or updating feeds
with conditions might result in a delay.
Limitations
Condition expressions have a length limit of 3,000 characters.
Most variable names in condition expressions are represented in lowercase
with underscores between each word. For example, example_variable .
The exception is the variable names of the sub-fields of data in the
Resource
object. These don't have word separators, and the first character of each word
after the first is capitalized. For example, exampleVariable .
Some validations on condition expressions are performed during feed creation
or feed update time. However, such validations are not comprehensive,
especially for conditions set on the temporal_asset.asset.resource.data
field, which has a dynamic type. Where possible, filter your feed by using
the appropriate gcloud CLI or REST API parameters instead.
Notifications aren't sent if errors happen during evaluation time, however the
errors are logged .
For dynamic types in temporal_asset.asset.resource.data , conditions
specified on absent fields trigger runtime errors and notifications aren't
published. For example, for the condition
temporal_asset.asset.resource.data.name != "my_name" , if the name field is
missing in an update, the evaluation fails and you don't receive
notifications. If your condition only works in the presence of certain fields,
add an existence check to the condition to ensure it is properly evaluated.
Static enum types can be represented as either fully qualified path names or
raw integers. For example, the following expressions are valid for
prior_asset_state :
temporal_asset.prior_asset_state == google.cloud.asset.v1.TemporalAsset.PriorAssetState.DOES_NOT_EXIST
and
temporal_asset.prior_asset_state == 3
Dynamic enum types in temporal_asset.asset.resource.data are represented as
raw strings. For example, the following expression is valid for the asset type
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project :
temporal_asset.asset.resource.data.lifecycleState == "ACTIVE"
Create a condition expression with CEL
In a feed condition,
Common Expression Language (CEL) is used
to make boolean decisions based on attribute data. A condition expression
consists of one or more statements that are joined using logic operators. Each
statement expresses an attribute-based control rule that applies to the
TemporalAsset to determine whether a notification is sent.
The following CEL features are the most important for feed conditions:
Variables : Conditions use variables to express a given attribute, such as
temporal_asset.deleted ( Boolean ) or temporal_asset.asset.name
( String ). These variables are populated with values based on the context at
runtime.
Operators : Every data type, such as String , supports a set of
operators that can be used to create a logic expression. Most commonly,
operators are used to compare the value contained in a variable with a literal
value, such as
temporal_asset.asset.name == "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/12345" .
In this example, if the input value of temporal_asset.asset.name is
//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/12345 , then the expression
evaluates to true .
Functions : A function is a compound operator for data types that support
more complex operations. In condition expressions, there are predefined
functions that can be used in conjunction with a given data type. For example,
temporal_asset.asset.name.contains("keyword") uses a function called
contains to check if the value of temporal_asset.asset.name contains
"keyword" . If so, it evaluates to true .
Logical operators : Conditions support logical operators that can be used
to build complex logic expressions from basic expression statements: &&
(AND) and || (OR). These logical operators make it possible to use multiple
input variables in a condition expression. For example:
temporal_asset.deleted && temporal_asset.window.start_time.getFullYear() > 2020
joins two basic statements, and requires both statements to be met in order
to produce a true evaluation result.
For more information about CEL features, see the
language definition .
Handle unset properties
When accessing fields in the temporal_asset.asset.resource.data payload, it's
important to safely handle potentially unset fields, keys, or parent messages
to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.
For example, for an expression that monitors Compute Engine instance
updates and excludes instances with the label xyz , you might write something
similar to the following:
(has(temporal_asset.asset.resource.data) && !('xyz' in temporal_asset.asset.resource.data.labels))
The !('xyz' in temporal_asset.asset.resource.data.labels) part of this
expression, however, filters out both assets with the xyz label and assets
with no labels at all. This is because unlabeled assets don't have a label that
contains xyz .
A correct expression to include unlabeled assets might look like the following:
(has(temporal_asset.asset.resource.data) && (!has(temporal_asset.asset.resource.data.labels) || !('xyz' in temporal_asset.asset.resource.data.labels)))
Using condition variables
Condition variables allow you to create conditions on different attributes.
Supported condition variables are:
temporal_asset : The most recent asset change in
TemporalAsset
format. If the condition evaluates to true, the TemporalAsset is sent to the
configured destination.
Example condition expressions
The following condition expression sends notifications on creation events:
temporal_asset.deleted == false &&
temporal_asset.prior_asset_state == google.cloud.asset.v1.TemporalAsset.PriorAssetState.DOES_NOT_EXIST
The following condition expression sends notifications for resources that are
located in folders 12345 and 23456 :
"folders/12345" in temporal_asset.asset.ancestors ||
"folders/23456" in temporal_asset.asset.ancestors
The following condition expression sends notifications when new allowed rules
are added to firewalls, assuming the asset type is already set to
compute.googleapis.com/Firewall in the feed:
size(temporal_asset.asset.resource.data.allowed) >
size(temporal_asset.prior_asset.resource.data.allowed)
The following condition expression sends notifications for VM instances with
n1-standard-1 machine type, assuming the asset type is already set to
compute.googleapis.com/Instance in the feed:
temporal_asset.asset.resource.data.machineType.endsWith('/machineTypes/n1-standard-1')
The following condition expression sends notifications for storage buckets with
any IAM policies for allUsers , assuming the asset type is set
to storage.googleapis.com/Bucket , and the content type is set to IAM_POLICY
in the feed:
temporal_asset.asset.iam_policy.bindings.exists(b, b.members.exists(m, m == "allUsers"))
The following condition expression sends a notification when a storage bucket
with the test key in its label is deleted:
temporal_asset.deleted == true && temporal_asset.prior_asset_state == google.cloud.asset.v1.TemporalAsset.PriorAssetState.PRESENT && "test" in temporal_asset.prior_asset.resource.data.labels
Troubleshooting
If you're not receiving notifications for resource or IAM policy
updates, the following steps can help you to troubleshoot:
Make sure that the metadata has changed on your assets. The real-time feed
only sends updates when the metadata of the supported
resource types has changed.
Operations such as uploading a new file to your Cloud Storage bucket
does not trigger a metadata change.
Make sure your assets match one of the asset names or types you specified in
the feed.
For project deletions, keep in mind that when you
shut down a project
you have 30 days to undo the operation. Because of this, the deleted field
in the asset metadata is not set until the project is permanently deleted. To
monitor projects that are pending deletion, you can set a
condition on the project's lifecycleState field instead. For
example:
temporal_asset.asset.resource.data.lifecycleState == "DELETE_REQUESTED" .
Check the logs to see if there are errors when publishing updates
to your topic.
Cloud Logging
When real-time feeds fail to send resources or IAM policy updates
through Pub/Sub, Cloud Asset Inventory logs the error status and
message in Logging. Logging is enabled by default,
and belongs to Google Cloud Observability. Learn about
Google Cloud Observability pricing .
Viewing real-time feed logs
The real-time feed log is indexed by a Pub/Sub topic. To see all
logs:
Go to the Logs Explorer page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Logs Explorer
Click the Resource list, which is near to the Search all fields
box.
Search for Cloud Pub/Sub Topic , and then click the Cloud Pub/Sub Topic
resource type.
Click the topic ID you want to view.
Click Apply .
UTF-8 encoding is enforced for log fields. Characters that are not UTF-8
characters are replaced with question marks.
Logged information
Real-time feed log entries contain following types of information:
General information shown in most Google Cloud logs, such as severity,
project ID, project number, or timestamp.
Real-time feed log fields in jsonPayload , which contains asset name, feed
output config, and error status when publishing resource or IAM
policy updates.
The following table shows what kind of information each field contains.
Field
Type and description
name
string
Full Name of the feed. The format is one of the following:
projects/ PROJECT_ ID / feeds/ FEED_ ID
folders/ FOLDER_ ID / feeds/ FEED_ ID
organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ ID / feeds/ FEED_ ID
asset_name
string
Full name of the asset to receive updates. For example:
/ / compute. googleapis. com/ projects/ my_ project_ 123/ zones/ zone1/ instances/ instance1
See
Resource names
for more info.
