Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage location/BigQuery table. For Cloud Storage location destinations, the output format is newline-delimited JSON. Each line represents a google.cloud.asset.v1.Asset in the JSON format; for BigQuery table destinations, the output table stores the fields in asset Protobuf as columns. This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API, which allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation result. For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually finishes within 5 minutes.
HTTP request
POST https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=*/*}:exportAssets
The URL uses gRPC Transcoding syntax.
Path parameters
Parameters
parent
string
Required. The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an organization number (such as "organizations/123"), a project ID (such as "projects/my-project-id"), or a project number (such as "projects/12345"), or a folder number (such as "folders/123").
Authorization requires one or more of the following IAM permissions on the specified resource parent :
cloudasset.assets.exportResource
cloudasset.assets.exportIamPolicy
Request body
The request body contains data with the following structure:
JSON representation
{
"readTime" : string ,
"assetTypes" : [
string
] ,
"contentType" : enum ( ContentType ) ,
"outputConfig" : {
object ( OutputConfig )
} ,
"relationshipTypes" : [
string
]
}
Fields
readTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Timestamp to take an asset snapshot. This can only be set to a timestamp between the current time and the current time minus 35 days (inclusive). If not specified, the current time will be used. Due to delays in resource data collection and indexing, there is a volatile window during which running the same query may get different results.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
assetTypes[]
string
A list of asset types to take a snapshot for. For example: "compute.googleapis.com/Disk".
Regular expressions are also supported. For example:
"compute.googleapis.com.*" snapshots resources whose asset type starts with "compute.googleapis.com".
".*Instance" snapshots resources whose asset type ends with "Instance".
".*Instance.*" snapshots resources whose asset type contains "Instance".
See RE2 for all supported regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.
If specified, only matching assets will be returned, otherwise, it will snapshot all asset types. See Introduction to Cloud Asset Inventory for all supported asset types.
contentType
enum ( ContentType )
Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name will be returned.
outputConfig
object ( OutputConfig )
Required. Output configuration indicating where the results will be output to.
relationshipTypes[]
string
A list of relationship types to export, for example: INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP . This field should only be specified if contentType=RELATIONSHIP. * If specified: it snapshots specified relationships. It returns an error if any of the [relationshipTypes] doesn't belong to the supported relationship types of the [assetTypes] or if any of the [assetTypes] doesn't belong to the source types of the [relationshipTypes]. * Otherwise: it snapshots the supported relationships for all [assetTypes] or returns an error if any of the [assetTypes] has no relationship support. An unspecified asset types field means all supported assetTypes. See Introduction to Cloud Asset Inventory for all supported asset types and relationship types.
Response body
If successful, the response body contains an instance of Operation .
Authorization scopes
Requires the following OAuth scope:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
For more information, see the Authentication Overview .
OutputConfig
Output configuration for export assets destination.
JSON representation
{
// Union field destination can be only one of the following:
"gcsDestination" : {
object ( GcsDestination )
} ,
"bigqueryDestination" : {
object ( BigQueryDestination )
}
// End of list of possible types for union field destination .
}
Fields
Union field destination . Asset export destination. destination can be only one of the following:
gcsDestination
object ( GcsDestination )
Destination on Cloud Storage.
bigqueryDestination
object ( BigQueryDestination )
Destination on BigQuery. The output table stores the fields in asset Protobuf as columns in BigQuery.
GcsDestination
A Cloud Storage location.
JSON representation
{
// Union field object_uri can be only one of the following:
"uri" : string ,
"uriPrefix" : string
// End of list of possible types for union field object_uri .
}
Fields
Union field object_uri . Required. object_uri can be only one of the following:
uri
string
The URI of the Cloud Storage object. It's the same URI that is used by gsutil. Example: "gs://bucket_name/object_name". See Viewing and Editing Object Metadata for more information.
If the specified Cloud Storage object already exists and there is no hold , it will be overwritten with the exported result.
uriPrefix
string
The URI prefix of all generated Cloud Storage objects. Example: "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix". Each object URI is in format: "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/ / and only contains assets for that type. starts from 0. Example: "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/compute.googleapis.com/Disk/0" is the first shard of output objects containing all compute.googleapis.com/Disk assets. An INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned if file with the same name "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix" already exists.
BigQueryDestination
A BigQuery destination for exporting assets to.
JSON representation
{
"dataset" : string ,
"table" : string ,
"force" : boolean ,
"partitionSpec" : {
object ( PartitionSpec )
} ,
"separateTablesPerAssetType" : boolean
}
Fields
dataset
string
Required. The BigQuery dataset in format "projects/projectId/datasets/datasetId", to which the snapshot result should be exported. If this dataset does not exist, the export call returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error. Setting the contentType for exportAssets determines the schema of the BigQuery table. Setting separateTablesPerAssetType to TRUE also influences the schema.
table
string
Required. The BigQuery table to which the snapshot result should be written. If this table does not exist, a new table with the given name will be created.
force
boolean
If the destination table already exists and this flag is TRUE , the table will be overwritten by the contents of assets snapshot. If the flag is FALSE or unset and the destination table already exists, the export call returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
partitionSpec
object ( PartitionSpec )
[partitionSpec] determines whether to export to partitioned table(s) and how to partition the data.
If [partitionSpec] is unset or [partitionSpec.partition_key] is unset or PARTITION_KEY_UNSPECIFIED , the snapshot results will be exported to non-partitioned table(s). [force] will decide whether to overwrite existing table(s).
If [partitionSpec] is specified. First, the snapshot results will be written to partitioned table(s) with two additional timestamp columns, readTime and requestTime, one of which will be the partition key. Secondly, in the case when any destination table already exists, it will first try to update existing table's schema as necessary by appending additional columns. Then, if [force] is TRUE , the corresponding partition will be overwritten by the snapshot results (data in different partitions will remain intact); if [force] is unset or FALSE , it will append the data. An error will be returned if the schema update or data appension fails.
separateTablesPerAssetType
boolean
If this flag is TRUE , the snapshot results will be written to one or multiple tables, each of which contains results of one asset type. The [force] and [partitionSpec] fields will apply to each of them.
Field [table] will be concatenated with "_" and the asset type names (see https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types for supported asset types) to construct per-asset-type table names, in which all non-alphanumeric characters like "." and "/" will be substituted by "_". Example: if field [table] is "mytable" and snapshot results contain "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket" assets, the corresponding table name will be "mytable_storage_googleapis_com_Bucket". If any of these tables does not exist, a new table with the concatenated name will be created.
When [contentType] in the ExportAssetsRequest is RESOURCE , the schema of each table will include RECORD-type columns mapped to the nested fields in the Asset.resource.data field of that asset type (up to the 15 nested level BigQuery supports ( https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#limitations)) . The fields in >15 nested levels will be stored in JSON format string as a child column of its parent RECORD column.
If error occurs when exporting to any table, the whole export call will return an error but the export results that already succeed will persist. Example: if exporting to table_type_A succeeds when exporting to table_type_B fails during one export call, the results in table_type_A will persist and there will not be partial results persisting in a table.
PartitionSpec
Specifications of BigQuery partitioned table as export destination.
JSON representation
{
"partitionKey" : enum ( PartitionKey )
}
Fields
partitionKey
enum ( PartitionKey )
The partition key for BigQuery partitioned table.
PartitionKey
This enum is used to determine the partition key column when exporting assets to BigQuery partitioned table(s). Note that, if the partition key is a timestamp column, the actual partition is based on its date value (expressed in UTC. see details in https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables#date_timestamp_partitioned_tables) .
Enums
PARTITION_KEY_UNSPECIFIED
Unspecified partition key. If used, it means using non-partitioned table.
READ_TIME
The time when the snapshot is taken. If specified as partition key, the result table(s) is partitioned by the additional timestamp column, readTime. If [readTime] in ExportAssetsRequest is specified, the readTime column's value will be the same as it. Otherwise, its value will be the current time that is used to take the snapshot.
REQUEST_TIME
The time when the request is received and started to be processed. If specified as partition key, the result table(s) is partitioned by the requestTime column, an additional timestamp column representing when the request was received.
