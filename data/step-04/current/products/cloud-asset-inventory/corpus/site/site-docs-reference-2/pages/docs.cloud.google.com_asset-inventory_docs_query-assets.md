Query assets with SQL
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: This feature requires access to the
Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier ,
or Gemini Cloud Assist . For new sign
ups to the Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier, it can take up to 6 hours
for access to the API, and up to 48 hours for historical data to be ready.
You can query assets in your project, folder, or organization using a
BigQuery SQL -compatible
dialect.
Before you begin
Enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API in the project you're running Cloud Asset Inventory commands
from.
Enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API
Make sure your account has the
correct role to call the Cloud Asset Inventory API .
For individual permissions for each call type, see
Permissions .
Limitations
Asset type names have . and / replaced
with _ . For example, compute.googleapis.com/Instance becomes
compute_googleapis_com_Instance .
The request must be a SELECT query.
Legacy BigQuery SQL isn't
supported.
Query results larger than 10GB aren't supported .
Query results larger than 10MB or 1,000 rows are always paginated.
Queries must take less than 6 hours to process .
Query results can only be exported to a BigQuery dataset
in the US multi-region .
Tables you can query
You can query the following tables:
For RESOURCE content types, table names in the dataset correspond to the
asset type name, assuming that asset type exists. For example, the
compute_googleapis_com_Instance table contains Compute Engine
instance metadata.
For non- RESOURCE content types, table names in the dataset correspond to the
RPC/REST content type names .
For example, ACCESS_POLICY .
To query resource standard metadata across resource types, use the table name
STANDARD_METADATA . This includes all fields except resource.DATA , which is
specific to each resource type.
Query asset metadata
Console
To query the asset metadata for your project, folder, or organization,
complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Asset query tab on
the Asset Inventory page.
Go to Asset query
If the Asset query tab doesn't appear, you need access to the
Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier ,
or
Gemini Cloud Assist .
Change to the project, folder, or organization you want to query.
Click the Asset query tab.
To query asset metadata, either use a sample query or build your
own:
To use a sample, click an entry in the Query library tab to
preview the query. Click Apply to copy that sample into the
Edit query box, then either edit the query, or click
Run to execute it.
To build your own query, enter the query text directly into the
Edit query box, then click Run to execute it. To
assist in writing your own query, you can click a table in the
Select table pane to preview its schema and content. See
Query syntax to learn how to construct a query.
The asset metadata matching the query is shown in the
Query result tab.
Optional: To download the query result sets in CSV format, click
Export .
The maximum size of the CSV file is 2 MB. If the download
request fails because the file size exceeds this limit, a message
appears with instructions for exporting the full results.

To find the ID of a Google Cloud folder, complete the following steps:
Go to the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Google Cloud console
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box.
Search for your folder name. The folder ID is shown next to the folder name.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve the ID of a Google Cloud folder that's located at the organization level with the following command:
gcloud resource-manager folders list \
--organization = $( gcloud organizations describe ORGANIZATION_NAME \
--format = "value(name.segment(1))" ) \
--filter = '"DISPLAY_NAME":" TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME "' \
--format = "value(ID)"
Where TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME is a partial or full string match for the
folder's name. Remove the --format flag to see more information about the
found folders.
The previous command doesn't return the IDs of subfolders within folders. To do so,
run the following command using a top level folder's ID:
gcloud resource-manager folders list --folder = FOLDER_ID
organization= ORGANIZATION_ID , where
ORGANIZATION_ID is the ID of the organization that has the assets you want to query.
How to find the ID of a Google Cloud organization

SQL_SELECT_QUERY : An SQL SELECT
query.
TIMEOUT : Optional. The maximum time, in seconds, that a
client should wait for the query to complete before continuing. Use timeouts to asynchronously
run your query, and retrieve the results later with job
references.
See the gcloud CLI reference for
all options.
Example
Run the following command to get the names and asset types of the first two Compute Engine
instances in the my-project project.
gcloud asset query \
--project = my-project \
--statement = "
SELECT
name, assetType
FROM
compute_googleapis_com_Instance
LIMIT 2"
Finished job response
The following sample shows a response to the previous example query. The
response contains a job reference and tells you whether the job has
finished ( done: true ). If the job has finished, then the
queryResult object is populated with the appropriate data,
and the results are listed afterward.
done: true
jobReference: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
queryResult:
nextPageToken: ''
totalRows: '2'
name: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/instance-1
assetType: compute.googleapis.com/Instance
name: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-c/instances/instance-2
assetType: compute.googleapis.com/Instance
Unfinished job response
If you set a timeout in your request, the query is performed
asynchronously and you are sent a response that indicates the job is
unfinished ( done: false ). These sorts of responses contain a
job reference and an unpopulated queryResult object:
done: false
jobReference: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
queryResult:
nextPageToken: ''
totalRows: '0'
You can use the jobReference value to
retrieve the query results later , after the
job has completed and the data is available.

Finished job response
The following sample shows a response to the previous example query. The
response contains a job reference and tells you whether the job has
finished ( "done": true ). If the job has finished, then the
queryResult object is populated with the appropriate
data.
Query results are split into rows , an array that contains
asset metadata, and schema , an object which describes the
schema for each asset in the rows array. This is done to
minimize duplication of field names and types in large responses.
Similarly, f and v are used in the
rows array instead of fields and
value to keep responses as small as possible.

Unfinished job response
If you set a timeout in your request, the query is performed
asynchronously and you are sent a response that indicates the job is
unfinished ( "done": false ). These sorts of responses contain
a job reference and an unpopulated queryResult object:
{
"jobReference" : "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" ,

How to find a Google Cloud project number
Google Cloud console
To find a Google Cloud project number, complete the following steps:
Go to the Welcome page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Welcome
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box, and then search for your project name.
The project name, project number, and project ID are shown near the Welcome
heading.
Up to 4,000 resources are displayed. If you don't see the project you're looking for,
go to the
Manage resources page and
filter the list using the name of that project.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve a Google Cloud project number with the following command:
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID --format = "value(projectNumber)"
folders/ FOLDER_ID , where FOLDER_ID is the
ID of the folder that has the asset metadata you want to export with an SQL query.
How to find the ID of a Google Cloud folder
Google Cloud console
To find the ID of a Google Cloud folder, complete the following steps:
Go to the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Google Cloud console
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box.
Search for your folder name. The folder ID is shown next to the folder name.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve the ID of a Google Cloud folder that's located at the organization level with the following command:
gcloud resource-manager folders list \
--organization = $( gcloud organizations describe ORGANIZATION_NAME \
--format = "value(name.segment(1))" ) \
--filter = '"DISPLAY_NAME":" TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME "' \
--format = "value(ID)"
Where TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME is a partial or full string match for the
folder's name. Remove the --format flag to see more information about the
found folders.
The previous command doesn't return the IDs of subfolders within folders. To do so,
run the following command using a top level folder's ID:
gcloud resource-manager folders list --folder = FOLDER_ID
organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID , where
ORGANIZATION_ID is the ID of the organization that has the asset metadata you want to export with an SQL query.

BILLING_PROJECT_ID : The project ID that the
default Cloud Asset Inventory service agent is in that has permissions to manage your
BigQuery datasets and tables.
Read more about setting the billing project .
SQL_SELECT_QUERY : An SQL SELECT
query.
BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID : The ID of
the project that the BigQuery table is in that you want to export to.
DATASET_ID : The ID of the BigQuery
dataset.
TABLE_NAME : The BigQuery table that
you're exporting your metadata to. If it doesn't exist, it's created.
WRITE_METHOD : Specifies the behavior if the
BigQuery destination table or partition already exists. The following values are
supported:
WRITE_EMPTY : Default. If the existing table contains data, a duplicate error is returned in the
job result.
WRITE_APPEND : Appends data to the table or the latest partition.
WRITE_TRUNCATE : Overwrites the entire table or all partitions data.
PAGE_SIZE : Optional. The number of results to return per
page. The maximum is 500. If the value is set to 0 or a negative value, an
appropriate default is selected. A nextPageToken is returned to retrieve
subsequent results.
Command examples
Run one of the following commands to get the names and asset types of the first two
Compute Engine instances in the my-project project, and export the results to the
my-table BigQuery table in the my-project project, overwriting
the entire table if it already exists.
