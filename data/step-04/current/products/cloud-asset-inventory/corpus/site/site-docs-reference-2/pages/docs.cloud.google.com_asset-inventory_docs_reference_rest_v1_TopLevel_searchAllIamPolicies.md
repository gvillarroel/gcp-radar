Searches all IAM policies within the specified scope, such as a project, folder, or organization. The caller must be granted the cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies permission on the desired scope, otherwise the request will be rejected.
HTTP request
GET https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/{scope=*/*}:searchAllIamPolicies
The URL uses gRPC Transcoding syntax.
Path parameters
Parameters
scope
string
Required. A scope can be a project, a folder, or an organization. The search is limited to the IAM policies within the scope . The caller must be granted the cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies permission on the desired scope.
The allowed values are:
projects/{PROJECT_ID} (e.g., "projects/foo-bar")
projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER} (e.g., "projects/12345678")
folders/{FOLDER_NUMBER} (e.g., "folders/1234567")
organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (e.g., "organizations/123456")
Authorization requires the following IAM permission on the specified resource scope :
cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies
Query parameters
Parameters
query
string
Optional. The query statement. See how to construct a query for more information. If not specified or empty, it will search all the IAM policies within the specified scope . Note that the query string is compared against each IAM policy binding, including its principals, roles, and IAM conditions. The returned IAM policies will only contain the bindings that match your query. To learn more about the IAM policy structure, see the IAM policy documentation .
Examples:
policy:amy@gmail.com to find IAM policy bindings that specify user "amy@gmail.com".
policy:roles/compute.admin to find IAM policy bindings that specify the Compute Admin role.
policy:comp* to find IAM policy bindings that contain "comp" as a prefix of any word in the binding.
policy.role.permissions:storage.buckets.update to find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing "storage.buckets.update" permission. Note that if callers don't have iam.roles.get access to a role's included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results.
policy.role.permissions:upd* to find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing "upd" as a prefix of any word in the role permission. Note that if callers don't have iam.roles.get access to a role's included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results.
resource:organizations/123456 to find IAM policy bindings that are set on "organizations/123456".
resource=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/myproject to find IAM policy bindings that are set on the project named "myproject".
Important to find IAM policy bindings that contain "Important" as a word in any of the searchable fields (except for the included permissions).
resource:(instance1 OR instance2) policy:amy to find IAM policy bindings that are set on resources "instance1" or "instance2" and also specify user "amy".
roles:roles/compute.admin to find IAM policy bindings that specify the Compute Admin role.
memberTypes:user to find IAM policy bindings that contain the principal type "user".
pageSize
integer
Optional. The page size for search result pagination. Page size is capped at 500 even if a larger value is given. If set to zero or a negative value, server will pick an appropriate default. Returned results may be fewer than requested. When this happens, there could be more results as long as nextPageToken is returned.
pageToken
string
Optional. If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to this method. pageToken must be the value of nextPageToken from the previous response. The values of all other method parameters must be identical to those in the previous call.
assetTypes[]
string
Optional. A list of asset types that the IAM policies are attached to. If empty, it will search the IAM policies that are attached to all the asset types supported by search APIs
Regular expressions are also supported. For example:
"compute.googleapis.com.*" snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type starts with "compute.googleapis.com".
".*Instance" snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type ends with "Instance".
".*Instance.*" snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type contains "Instance".
See RE2 for all supported regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.
orderBy
string
Optional. A comma-separated list of fields specifying the sorting order of the results. The default order is ascending. Add " DESC" after the field name to indicate descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored. Example: "assetType DESC, resource". Only singular primitive fields in the response are sortable: * resource * assetType * project All the other fields such as repeated fields (e.g., folders ) and non-primitive fields (e.g., policy ) are not supported.
Request body
The request body must be empty.
Response body
Search all IAM policies response.
If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:
JSON representation
{
"results" : [
{
object ( IamPolicySearchResult )
}
] ,
"nextPageToken" : string
}
Fields
results[]
object ( IamPolicySearchResult )
A list of IAM policies that match the search query. Related information such as the associated resource is returned along with the policy.
nextPageToken
string
Set if there are more results than those appearing in this response; to get the next set of results, call this method again, using this value as the pageToken .
Authorization scopes
Requires the following OAuth scope:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
For more information, see the Authentication Overview .
IamPolicySearchResult
A result of IAM Policy search, containing information of an IAM policy.
JSON representation
{
"resource" : string ,
"assetType" : string ,
"project" : string ,
"folders" : [
string
] ,
"organization" : string ,
"policy" : {
object ( Policy )
} ,
"explanation" : {
object ( Explanation )
}
}
Fields
resource
string
The full resource name of the resource associated with this IAM policy. Example: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1 . See Cloud Asset Inventory Resource Name Format for more information.
To search against the resource :
use a field query. Example: resource:organizations/123
assetType
string
The type of the resource associated with this IAM policy. Example: compute.googleapis.com/Disk .
To search against the assetType :
specify the assetTypes field in your search request.
project
string
The project that the associated Google Cloud resource belongs to, in the form of projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER}. If an IAM policy is set on a resource (like VM instance, Cloud Storage bucket), the project field will indicate the project that contains the resource. If an IAM policy is set on a folder or organization, this field will be empty.
To search against the project :
specify the scope field as this project in your search request.
folders[]
string
The folder(s) that the IAM policy belongs to, in the form of folders/{FOLDER_NUMBER}. This field is available when the IAM policy belongs to one or more folders.
To search against folders :
use a field query. Example: folders:(123 OR 456)
use a free text query. Example: 123
specify the scope field as this folder in your search request.
organization
string
The organization that the IAM policy belongs to, in the form of organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER}. This field is available when the IAM policy belongs to an organization.
To search against organization :
use a field query. Example: organization:123
use a free text query. Example: 123
specify the scope field as this organization in your search request.
policy
object ( Policy )
The IAM policy directly set on the given resource. Note that the original IAM policy can contain multiple bindings. This only contains the bindings that match the given query. For queries that don't contain a constrain on policies (e.g., an empty query), this contains all the bindings.
To search against the policy bindings:
use a field query:
query by the policy contained members. Example: policy:amy@gmail.com
query by the policy contained roles. Example: policy:roles/compute.admin
query by the policy contained roles' included permissions. Example: policy.role.permissions:compute.instances.create
explanation
object ( Explanation )
Explanation about the IAM policy search result. It contains additional information to explain why the search result matches the query.

JSON representation
{
"matchedPermissions" : {
string : {
object ( Permissions )
} ,
...
}
}
Fields
matchedPermissions
map (key: string, value: object ( Permissions ))
The map from roles to their included permissions that match the permission query (i.e., a query containing policy.role.permissions: ). Example: if query policy.role.permissions:compute.disk.get matches a policy binding that contains owner role, the matchedPermissions will be {"roles/owner": ["compute.disk.get"]} . The roles can also be found in the returned policy bindings. Note that the map is populated only for requests with permission queries.
An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" } .
