Search for IAM allow policies on resources
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can search for IAM allow policies on your resources in a
project, folder, or organization, and filter the returned results using a query.
Note: To find deny policies, you can use a
resource search .
Before you begin
Enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API in the project you're running Cloud Asset Inventory commands
from.
Enable the Cloud Asset Inventory API
Make sure your account has the
correct role to call the Cloud Asset Inventory API .
For individual permissions for each call type, see
Permissions .
Construct a query
Before constructing a query, it can be useful to start with a search request
that doesn't specify a query. Use the fields and values from the full response
to create a query using the
search query syntax , and refine it
until the results you want are returned.
Fields that can be used in a query are detailed in the
IamPolicySearchResult reference documentation .
Keep in mind the following limitations when constructing a query:
The policy field is
a nested object, so can only be used with the : operator.
Not all asset types are searchable. See
Resource types to confirm if a
service isn't available in the search APIs.
The following additional fields can also be used to restrict your results to
certain principal types, permissions, or roles:
Field
Description
memberTypes
Contains one of the following
IAM principal types :
user
group
domain
serviceAccount
allUsers
allAuthenticatedUsers
Example
memberTypes=user
policy.role.permissions
Contains specific
IAM permissions .
Example
policy.role.permissions=storage.buckets.create
Note : The caller must have the
iam.roles.get permission for permissions to be
listed in a searchAllIamPolicies response.
roles
Contains specific
IAM roles .
Example
roles=roles/storage.objectAdmin
Search for IAM allow policies
Before constructing a query, it can be useful to start with a search request
that doesn't specify a query. Use the fields and values from the full response
to create a query using the
search query syntax , and refine it
until the results you want are returned.
Console
To search for IAM allow policy metadata, complete the
following steps.
Go to the Asset Inventory page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Asset Inventory
Change to the project, folder, or organization you want to search.
Click the IAM policy tab.
To search allow policies, enter a query in the Filter field. See
Search query syntax
to learn how to write a search query.
To make constructing queries easier, you can click the Filter
field to display and add the available searchable fields to your
query.
After performing a search, the allow policies matching the query are
listed in the Results table. Double-click your query to edit it, or
use the Filter results pane to apply quick Query presets or
restrict the search results by specific criteria.
To view the query as a Google Cloud CLI command, click View query .
To export the results, click Download CSV .
gcloud
gcloud asset search-all-iam-policies \
--scope = SCOPE_PATH \
--query = " QUERY " \
--asset-types = ASSET_TYPE_1 , ASSET_TYPE_2 ,... \
--order-by = " ORDER_BY " Provide the following values:
SCOPE_PATH : Use one of the following values:
The allowed values are:
projects/ PROJECT_ID , where PROJECT_ID is the
ID of the project that has assets with IAM allow policies you want to search for.
projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER , where
PROJECT_NUMBER is the number of the project that has assets with IAM allow policies you want to search for.
How to find a Google Cloud project number
Google Cloud console
To find a Google Cloud project number, complete the following steps:
Go to the Welcome page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Welcome
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box, and then search for your project name.
The project name, project number, and project ID are shown near the Welcome
heading.
Up to 4,000 resources are displayed. If you don't see the project you're looking for,
go to the
Manage resources page and
filter the list using the name of that project.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve a Google Cloud project number with the following command:
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID --format = "value(projectNumber)"
folders/ FOLDER_ID , where FOLDER_ID is the
ID of the folder that has assets with IAM allow policies you want to search for.
How to find the ID of a Google Cloud folder
Google Cloud console
To find the ID of a Google Cloud folder, complete the following steps:
Go to the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Google Cloud console
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box.
Search for your folder name. The folder ID is shown next to the folder name.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve the ID of a Google Cloud folder that's located at the organization level with the following command:
gcloud resource-manager folders list \
--organization = $( gcloud organizations describe ORGANIZATION_NAME \
--format = "value(name.segment(1))" ) \
--filter = '"DISPLAY_NAME":" TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME "' \
--format = "value(ID)"
Where TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME is a partial or full string match for the
folder's name. Remove the --format flag to see more information about the
found folders.
The previous command doesn't return the IDs of subfolders within folders. To do so,
run the following command using a top level folder's ID:
gcloud resource-manager folders list --folder = FOLDER_ID
organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID , where
ORGANIZATION_ID is the ID of the organization that has assets with IAM allow policies you want to search for.
How to find the ID of a Google Cloud organization
Google Cloud console
To find the ID of a Google Cloud organization, complete the following steps:
Go to the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Google Cloud console
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box.
Click the All tab. The organization ID is shown next to the organization name.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve the ID of a Google Cloud organization with the following command:
gcloud organizations describe ORGANIZATION_NAME --format = "value(name.segment(1))"
QUERY : Optional. The query expression. If not specified or
empty, all resources are searched for in the specified scope. To learn how to write a search
query, see Search query syntax .
ASSET_TYPE_# : Optional. A comma-separated list of
searchable asset types .
RE2-compatible regular expressions are supported. If the regular expression doesn't match
any supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. When
--asset-types isn't specified, all asset types are returned.
ORDER_BY : Optional. A comma-separated list of fields
specifying the sorting order of the results. The default order is ascending. Add
DESC after the field name to indicate descending order. See the
reference documentation for what fields can be sorted.
You can use the --format and
--flatten flags to format the
gcloud CLI output.
See the gcloud CLI reference for
all options.

Additional search examples
The following code samples show specific search queries for both
gcloud and REST to help you to construct your own searches.
Resources with IAM allow policies

IAM allow policies in the my-project project.

The following sample shows how to search for all resources with example in
their name that have IAM allow policies.
gcloud

REST
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ my-project :searchAllIamPolicies
Note : You can use a GET method for this request with parameters as a query
string. However, the request URL is
length limited , meaning the server rejects the
request if the query string is too long. To avoid length restrictions, use a POST
request instead, set a header of X-HTTP-Method-Override: GET , and use a JSON body
for your parameters.
Request JSON body:
{
"pageSize" : 1 ,
"query" : "resource:example"

REST
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ my-organization-id :searchAllIamPolicies
Note : You can use a GET method for this request with parameters as a query
string. However, the request URL is
length limited , meaning the server rejects the
request if the query string is too long. To avoid length restrictions, use a POST
request instead, set a header of X-HTTP-Method-Override: GET , and use a JSON body
for your parameters.
Request JSON body:
{
"pageSize" : 1 ,
"query" : "policy.role.permissions:(resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy OR resourcemanager.folders.setIamPolicy OR resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy)"
