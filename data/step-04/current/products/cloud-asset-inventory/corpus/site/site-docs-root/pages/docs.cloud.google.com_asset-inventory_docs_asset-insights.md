Improve your security posture with asset insights
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud Asset Inventory insights can help to detect potential risks in your asset
configurations, and help you to improve your security posture. It's part of the
Recommender service, and is provided as the
google.cloudasset.asset.Insight insight type.
Insights are specific anomalies which require further analysis to determine
appropriate action. They are generated daily, based on a snapshot of the data
stored in Cloud Asset Inventory.
The insights provided by
Cloud Asset Inventory are based on the IAM policies associated with
your organization's resources.
Before you begin
Before you can begin using asset insights, you must complete the following
steps.
Enable the Recommender API .
Make sure that your account has the following permissions:
recommender.cloudAssetInsights.get
recommender.cloudAssetInsights.list
recommender.cloudAssetInsights.update
You can grant these permissions individually, or you can grant one of the
following roles.
Cloud Asset Insights Viewer ( roles/recommender.cloudAssetInsightsViewer )
role
Cloud Asset Insights Admin ( roles/recommender.cloudAssetInsightsAdmin )
role
Limitations
These insights don't consider group memberships or service accounts as part of
their findings, and shouldn't be considered an exhaustive list of matching
vulnerabilities.
Individual insights include a sampling of matching IAM policies
capped at 100 distinct policies. All matching policies can be retrieved by
searching for IAM allow policies on resources .
Request asset insights
The easiest way to request asset insights is to list them, as shown in the
following steps. For other types of insights interactions, see
Use the API - Insights .
gcloud
gcloud recommender insights list \
-- SCOPE \
--location = global \
--insight-type = google.cloudasset.asset.Insight \
--filter = "insightSubtype: SUBTYPE " \ Provide the following values:
SCOPE : Use one of the following values:
project= PROJECT_ID , where PROJECT_ID is the
ID of the project you want insights for.
folder= FOLDER_ID , where FOLDER_ID is the
ID of the folder you want insights for.
How to find the ID of a Google Cloud folder
Google Cloud console
To find the ID of a Google Cloud folder, complete the following steps:
Go to the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Google Cloud console
Click the switcher list box in the menu bar.
Select your organization from the list box.
Search for your folder name. The folder ID is shown next to the folder name.
gcloud CLI
You can retrieve the ID of a Google Cloud folder that's located at the organization level with the following command:
gcloud resource-manager folders list \
--organization = $( gcloud organizations describe ORGANIZATION_NAME \
--format = "value(name.segment(1))" ) \
--filter = '"DISPLAY_NAME":" TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME "' \
--format = "value(ID)"
Where TOP_LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME is a partial or full string match for the
folder's name. Remove the --format flag to see more information about the
found folders.
The previous command doesn't return the IDs of subfolders within folders. To do so,
run the following command using a top level folder's ID:
gcloud resource-manager folders list --folder = FOLDER_ID
organization= ORGANIZATION_ID , where
ORGANIZATION_ID is the ID of the organization you want insights for.
How to find the ID of a Google Cloud organization

BILLING_PROJECT_ID : Optional. The project ID that the
default Cloud Asset Inventory service agent is in that has permissions to manage your
billing and quota.
Read more about setting the billing project .
SUBTYPE : The asset insight subtype. One of the
following values:
EXTERNAL_MEMBER : Detects IAM policies containing users or groups
which belong to a domain outside of your organization's domains.
EXTERNAL_POLICY_EDITOR : Detects IAM policies containing users or
groups outside of your organization's domains that are granted permission to modify
IAM policies.
EXTERNAL_CLOUD_STORAGE_OBJECT_VIEWER : Detects IAM policies

containing users or groups outside of your organization's domains that are granted
permission to impersonate service accounts.
TERMINATED_MEMBER : Detects IAM policies containing users or
groups with deactivated, deleted, or purged accounts.
PUBLIC_IAM_POLICY : Detects IAM policies containing all users or
all authenticated users.
OWNER_TERMINATED_PROJECT : Detects projects which do not contain any active
users or groups in the project's IAM policy.
If not specified, all subtypes are returned.
See the gcloud CLI reference for
all options.

Interpreting insight responses
In addition to the standard insight attributes ,
asset insights provide several specialized subtypes and fields.
Insight subtypes
The asset insight subtypes are as follows:
EXTERNAL_MEMBER : Detects IAM policies containing users or
groups which belong to a domain outside of your organization's domains.
EXTERNAL_POLICY_EDITOR : Detects IAM policies containing users
or groups outside of your organization's domains that are granted permission
to modify IAM policies.
EXTERNAL_CLOUD_STORAGE_OBJECT_VIEWER : Detects IAM policies
containing users or groups outside of your organization's domains that are
granted permission to get or list storage objects ( storage.objects.list or
storage.objects.get permission ).
EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_IMPERSONATOR : Detects IAM policies
containing users or groups outside of your organization's domains that are
granted permission to impersonate service accounts.
TERMINATED_MEMBER : Detects IAM policies containing users or
groups with deactivated, deleted, or purged accounts.
PUBLIC_IAM_POLICY : Detects IAM policies containing all users
or all authenticated users.
OWNER_TERMINATED_PROJECT : Detects projects which don't contain any active
users or groups in the project's IAM policy.
Additional content fields
In addition to the standard fields in the response, asset insights provide
several specialized fields in the content field.
user : The user email address detected in the members of the policy bindings
for this insight. This field is included in the TERMINATED_MEMBER subtype.
domain : The domain detected in the members of the policy bindings of this
insight. This field is included in the EXTERNAL_MEMBER ,
EXTERNAL_POLICY_EDITOR , EXTERNAL_CLOUD_STORAGE_OBJECT_VIEWER , and
EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_IMPERSONATOR subtypes.
assetName : The asset name for which access was detected in this insight.
This field is included in the OWNER_TERMINATED_PROJECT and
PUBLIC_IAM_POLICY subtypes.
policyCount : The total number of distinct IAM policies in
which matching members were detected for this insight. This field is included
for all asset insight subtypes.
matchedPolicies : A sampling of the IAM policies matching the
detected insight. Matching policies only include the subset of bindings and
binding members which match the detected insight. This field is included for
all asset insight subtypes.
policySearchQuery : A query which can be used with the Cloud Asset Inventory
IAM policy search API to retrieve the relevant policies in real
time.
