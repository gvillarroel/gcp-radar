Fields
updateTime
string ( Timestamp format)
The last update timestamp of an asset. updateTime is updated when create/update/delete operation is performed.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
name
string

resource
object ( Resource )
A representation of the resource.
iamPolicy
object ( Policy )
A representation of the IAM policy set on a Google Cloud resource. There can be a maximum of one IAM policy set on any given resource. In addition, IAM policies inherit their granted access scope from any policies set on parent resources in the resource hierarchy. Therefore, the effectively policy is the union of both the policy set on this resource and each policy set on all of the resource's ancestry resource levels in the hierarchy. See this topic for more information.
orgPolicy[]
object ( Policy )
A representation of an organization policy . There can be more than one organization policy with different constraints set on a given resource.

relatedAsset
object ( RelatedAsset )
One related asset of the current asset.
ancestors[]
string
The ancestry path of an asset in Google Cloud resource hierarchy , represented as a list of relative resource names. An ancestry path starts with the closest ancestor in the hierarchy and ends at root. If the asset is a project, folder, or organization, the ancestry path starts from the asset itself.
Example: ["projects/123456789", "folders/5432", "organizations/1234"]
assetExceptions[]
object ( AssetException )
The exceptions of a resource.

"data" : {
object
} ,
"location" : string
}
Fields
version
string
The API version. Example: v1
discoveryDocumentUri
string
The URL of the discovery document containing the resource's JSON schema. Example: https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/compute/v1/rest
This value is unspecified for resources that do not have an API based on a discovery document, such as Cloud Bigtable.

string
The JSON schema name listed in the discovery document. Example: Project
This value is unspecified for resources that do not have an API based on a discovery document, such as Cloud Bigtable.
resourceUrl
string
The REST URL for accessing the resource. An HTTP GET request using this URL returns the resource itself. Example: https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project-123
This value is unspecified for resources without a REST API.
parent
string
The full name of the immediate parent of this resource. See Resource Names for more information.
For Google Cloud assets, this value is the parent resource defined in the IAM policy hierarchy . Example: //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123
data
object ( Struct format)
The content of the resource, in which some sensitive fields are removed and may not be present.
location
string
The location of the resource in Google Cloud, such as its zone and region. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/ .
Policy
Defines a Cloud Organization Policy which is used to specify Constraints for configurations of Cloud Platform resources.
JSON representation
{
"version" : integer ,
"constraint" : string ,
"etag" : string ,
"updateTime" : string ,
// Union field policy_type can be only one of the following:
"listPolicy" : {
object ( ListPolicy )
} ,
"booleanPolicy" : {
object ( BooleanPolicy )
} ,
"restoreDefault" : {
object ( RestoreDefault )
}
// End of list of possible types for union field policy_type .
}
Fields
version
integer
Version of the Policy . Default version is 0;
constraint
string
The name of the Constraint the Policy is configuring, for example, constraints/serviceuser.services .
A list of available constraints is available.
Immutable after creation.
etag
string ( bytes format)
An opaque tag indicating the current version of the Policy , used for concurrency control.
When the Policy is returned from either a GetPolicy or a ListOrgPolicy request, this etag indicates the version of the current Policy to use when executing a read-modify-write loop.
When the Policy is returned from a policies.getEffectivePolicy request, the etag will be unset.
When the Policy is used in a SetOrgPolicy method, use the etag value that was returned from a GetOrgPolicy request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the etag in a SetOrgPolicy request will result in an unconditional write of the Policy .
A base64-encoded string.
updateTime
string ( Timestamp format)
The time stamp the Policy was previously updated. This is set by the server, not specified by the caller, and represents the last time a call to SetOrgPolicy was made for that Policy . Any value set by the client will be ignored.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
Union field policy_type . The field to populate is based on the constraint_type value in the Constraint . list_constraint => list_policy boolean_constraint => boolean_policy
A restore_default message may be used with any Constraint type.
Providing a *_policy that is incompatible with the constraint_type will result in an invalid_argument error.
Attempting to set a Policy with a policy_type not set will result in an invalid_argument error. policy_type can be only one of the following:
listPolicy
object ( ListPolicy )
List of values either allowed or disallowed.
booleanPolicy
object ( BooleanPolicy )
For boolean Constraints , whether to enforce the Constraint or not.
restoreDefault
object ( RestoreDefault )
Restores the default behavior of the constraint; independent of Constraint type.
ListPolicy
Used in policyType to specify how listPolicy behaves at this resource.
ListPolicy can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy ( Organizations , Folders , Projects ) that are allowed or denied by setting the allowedValues and deniedValues fields. This is achieved by using the under: and optional is: prefixes. The under: prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The is: prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a ":". Values prefixed with "is:" are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats:
"projects/ ", e.g. "projects/tokyo-rain-123"
"folders/ ", e.g. "folders/1234"
"organizations/ ", e.g. "organizations/1234"
The supportsUnder field of the associated Constraint defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set allowedValues and deniedValues in the same Policy if allValues is ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED . ALLOW or DENY are used to allow or deny all values. If allValues is set to either ALLOW or DENY , allowedValues and deniedValues must be unset.
JSON representation
{
"allowedValues" : [
string
] ,
"deniedValues" : [
string
] ,
"allValues" : enum ( AllValues ) ,
"suggestedValue" : string ,
"inheritFromParent" : boolean
}
Fields
allowedValues[]
string
List of values allowed at this resource. Can only be set if allValues is set to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED .
deniedValues[]
string
List of values denied at this resource. Can only be set if allValues is set to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED .
allValues
enum ( AllValues )
The policy allValues state.
suggestedValue
string
Optional. The Google Cloud Console will try to default to a configuration that matches the value specified in this Policy . If suggestedValue is not set, it will inherit the value specified higher in the hierarchy, unless inheritFromParent is false .
inheritFromParent
boolean
Determines the inheritance behavior for this Policy .
By default, a ListPolicy set at a resource supersedes any Policy set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if inheritFromParent is set to true , then the values from the effective Policy of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this Policy are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.
Setting Policy hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a Policy with allowedValues set that inherits a Policy with deniedValues set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in allowedValues and not present in deniedValues .
For example, suppose you have a Constraint constraints/serviceuser.services , which has a constraint_type of listConstraint , and with constraintDefault set to ALLOW . Suppose that at the Organization level, a Policy is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to { E1 , E2 }. Then, if a Policy is applied to a project below the Organization that has inheritFromParent set to false and field allValues set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.
The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for projects/bar parented by organizations/foo :
Example 1 (no inherited values): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues:"E2"} projects/bar has inheritFromParent false and values: {allowedValues: "E3" allowedValues: "E4"} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 . The accepted values at projects/bar are E3 , and E4 .
Example 2 (inherited values): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues:"E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with values: {value: "E3" value: "E4" inheritFromParent: true} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 . The accepted values at projects/bar are E1 , E2 , E3 , and E4 .
Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues: "E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with: {deniedValues: "E1"} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 . The value accepted at projects/bar is E2 .
Example 4 (RestoreDefault): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues:"E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 . The accepted values at projects/bar are either all or none depending on the value of constraintDefault (if ALLOW , all; if DENY , none).
Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): organizations/foo has no Policy set. projects/bar has no Policy set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of constraintDefault (if ALLOW , all; if DENY , none).
Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues: "E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 .
Any value is accepted at projects/bar`.
Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues: "E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 .
No value is accepted at projects/bar`.
Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1->{F1, F2}; F1->{P1}; F2->{P2, P3}, organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "under:organizations/O1"} projects/bar has a Policy with: {allowedValues: "under:projects/P3"} {deniedValues: "under:folders/F2"} The accepted values at organizations/foo are organizations/O1 , folders/F1 , folders/F2 , projects/P1 , projects/P2 , projects/P3 . The accepted values at projects/bar are organizations/O1 , folders/F1 , projects/P1 .
AllValues
This enum can be used to set Policies that apply to all possible configuration values rather than specific values in allowedValues or deniedValues .
Setting this to ALLOW will mean this Policy allows all values. Similarly, setting it to DENY will mean no values are allowed. If set to either ALLOW or DENY, allowedValues and deniedValues
must be unset. Setting this to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED allows for
setting allowedValues and deniedValues`.
Enums
ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED
Indicates that allowedValues or deniedValues must be set.
ALLOW
A policy with this set allows all values.
DENY
A policy with this set denies all values.
BooleanPolicy
Used in policyType to specify how booleanPolicy will behave at this resource.
JSON representation
{
"enforced" : boolean
}
Fields
enforced
boolean
If true , then the Policy is enforced. If false , then any configuration is acceptable.
Suppose you have a Constraint constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess with constraintDefault set to ALLOW . A Policy for that Constraint exhibits the following behavior: - If the Policy at this resource has enforced set to false , serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the Policy at this resource has enforced set to true , serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the Policy at this resource is RestoreDefault , serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no Policy is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no Policy is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the Policy were set at this resource.
The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings:
Example 1 (nearest Constraint wins): organizations/foo has a Policy with: {enforced: false} projects/bar has no Policy set. The constraint at projects/bar and organizations/foo will not be enforced.
Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): organizations/foo has a Policy with: {enforced: false} projects/bar has a Policy with: {enforced: true} The constraint at organizations/foo is not enforced. The constraint at projects/bar is enforced.
Example 3 (RestoreDefault): organizations/foo has a Policy with: {enforced: true} projects/bar has a Policy with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at organizations/foo is enforced. The constraint at projects/bar is not enforced, because constraintDefault for the Constraint is ALLOW .
RestoreDefault
This type has no fields.
Ignores policies set above this resource and restores the constraintDefault enforcement behavior of the specific Constraint at this resource.
Suppose that constraintDefault is set to ALLOW for the Constraint constraints/serviceuser.services . Suppose that organization foo.com sets a Policy at their Organization resource node that restricts the allowed service activations to deny all service activations. They could then set a Policy with the policyType restoreDefault on several experimental projects, restoring the constraintDefault enforcement of the Constraint for only those projects, allowing those projects to have all services activated.
AccessPolicy
AccessPolicy is a container for AccessLevels (which define the necessary attributes to use Google Cloud services) and ServicePerimeters (which define regions of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An access policy is globally visible within an organization, and the restrictions it specifies apply to all projects within an organization.
JSON representation
{
"name" : string ,
"parent" : string ,
"title" : string ,
"scopes" : [
string
] ,
"etag" : string
}
Fields
name
string
Output only. Identifier. Resource name of the AccessPolicy . Format: accessPolicies/{accessPolicy}
parent
string
Required. The parent of this AccessPolicy in the Cloud Resource Hierarchy. Currently immutable once created. Format: organizations/{organizationId}
title
string
Required. Human readable title. Does not affect behavior.
scopes[]
string
The scopes of the AccessPolicy . Scopes define which resources a policy can restrict and where its resources can be referenced. For example, policy A with scopes=["folders/123"] has the following behavior:
ServicePerimeter can only restrict projects within folders/123 .
ServicePerimeter within policy A can only reference access levels defined within policy A.
Only one policy can include a given scope; thus, attempting to create a second policy which includes folders/123 will result in an error.
If no scopes are provided, then any resource within the organization can be restricted. Scopes cannot be modified after a policy is created. Policies can only have a single scope. Format: list of folders/{folder_number} or projects/{projectNumber}
etag
string
Output only. An opaque identifier for the current version of the AccessPolicy . This will always be a strongly validated etag, meaning that two Access Policies will be identical if and only if their etags are identical. Clients should not expect this to be in any specific format.
AccessLevel
An AccessLevel is a label that can be applied to requests to Google Cloud services, along with a list of requirements necessary for the label to be applied.
JSON representation
{
"name" : string ,

}
Fields
name
string
Identifier. Resource name for the AccessLevel . Format: accessPolicies/{accessPolicy}/accessLevels/{accessLevel} .
The accessLevel component must begin with a letter, followed by alphanumeric characters or _ . Its maximum length is 50 characters.
After you create an AccessLevel , you cannot change its name .
title

}
Fields
conditions[]
object ( Condition )
Required. A list of requirements for the AccessLevel to be granted.
combiningFunction
enum ( ConditionCombiningFunction )
How the conditions list should be combined to determine if a request is granted this AccessLevel . If AND is used, each Condition in conditions must be satisfied for the AccessLevel to be applied. If OR is used, at least one Condition in conditions must be satisfied for the AccessLevel to be applied. Default behavior is AND.
Condition
A condition necessary for an AccessLevel to be granted. The Condition is an AND over its fields. So a Condition is true if: 1) the request IP is from one of the listed subnetworks AND 2) the originating device complies with the listed device policy AND 3) all listed access levels are granted AND 4) the request was sent at a time allowed by the DateTimeRestriction.

Fields
ipSubnetworks[]
string
CIDR block IP subnetwork specification. May be IPv4 or IPv6. Note that for a CIDR IP address block, the specified IP address portion must be properly truncated (i.e. all the host bits must be zero) or the input is considered malformed. For example, "192.0.2.0/24" is accepted but "192.0.2.1/24" is not. Similarly, for IPv6, "2001:db8::/32" is accepted whereas "2001:db8::1/32" is not. The originating IP of a request must be in one of the listed subnets in order for this Condition to be true. If empty, all IP addresses are allowed.
devicePolicy
object ( DevicePolicy )
Device specific restrictions, all restrictions must hold for the Condition to be true. If not specified, all devices are allowed.
requiredAccessLevels[]
string
A list of other access levels defined in the same Policy , referenced by resource name. Referencing an AccessLevel which does not exist is an error. All access levels listed must be granted for the Condition to be true. Example: " accessPolicies/MY_POLICY/accessLevels/LEVEL_NAME"
negate
boolean
Whether to negate the Condition. If true, the Condition becomes a NAND over its non-empty fields. Any non-empty field criteria evaluating to false will result in the Condition to be satisfied. Defaults to false.
members[]
string
The request must be made by one of the provided user or service accounts. Groups are not supported. Syntax: user:{emailid} serviceAccount:{emailid} If not specified, a request may come from any user.
regions[]
string
The request must originate from one of the provided countries/regions. Must be valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.
vpcNetworkSources[]
object ( VpcNetworkSource )
The request must originate from one of the provided VPC networks in Google Cloud. Cannot specify this field together with ipSubnetworks .
DevicePolicy
DevicePolicy specifies device specific restrictions necessary to acquire a given access level. A DevicePolicy specifies requirements for requests from devices to be granted access levels, it does not do any enforcement on the device. DevicePolicy acts as an AND over all specified fields, and each repeated field is an OR over its elements. Any unset fields are ignored. For example, if the proto is { osType : DESKTOP_WINDOWS, osType : DESKTOP_LINUX, encryption_status: ENCRYPTED}, then the DevicePolicy will be true for requests originating from encrypted Linux desktops and encrypted Windows desktops.

ServicePerimeter
ServicePerimeter describes a set of Google Cloud resources which can freely import and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the ServicePerimeter . If a request with a source within this ServicePerimeter has a target outside of the ServicePerimeter , the request will be blocked. Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single Google Cloud project or VPC network can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service Perimeter Bridges can contain only Google Cloud projects as members, a single Google Cloud project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.

}
Fields
name
string
Identifier. Resource name for the ServicePerimeter . Format: accessPolicies/{accessPolicy}/servicePerimeters/{servicePerimeter} .
The servicePerimeter component must begin with a letter, followed by alphanumeric characters or _ .
After you create a ServicePerimeter , you cannot change its name .
title
string
Human readable title. Must be unique within the Policy.
description
string
Description of the ServicePerimeter and its use. Does not affect behavior.
perimeterType
enum ( PerimeterType )
Perimeter type indicator. A single project or VPC network is allowed to be a member of single regular perimeter, but multiple service perimeter bridges. A project cannot be a included in a perimeter bridge without being included in regular perimeter. For perimeter bridges, the restricted service list as well as access level lists must be empty.
status
object ( ServicePerimeterConfig )
Current ServicePerimeter configuration. Specifies sets of resources, restricted services and access levels that determine perimeter content and boundaries.
spec
object ( ServicePerimeterConfig )
Proposed (or dry run) ServicePerimeter configuration. This configuration allows to specify and test ServicePerimeter configuration without enforcing actual access restrictions. Only allowed to be set when the "useExplicitDryRunSpec" flag is set.
useExplicitDryRunSpec
boolean
Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter. This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.
etag
string
Optional. An opaque identifier for the current version of the ServicePerimeter . This identifier does not follow any specific format. If an etag is not provided, the operation will be performed as if a valid etag is provided.
PerimeterType
Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels, and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most ONE regular Service Perimeter.
In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex toplogies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among themselves.
Enums
PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR
Regular Perimeter. When no value is specified, the perimeter uses this type.
PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE
Perimeter Bridge.
ServicePerimeterConfig
ServicePerimeterConfig specifies a set of Google Cloud resources that describe specific Service Perimeter configuration.
