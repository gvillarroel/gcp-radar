Analyzes IAM policies to answer which identities have what accesses on which resources.
HTTP request
GET https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/{analysisQuery.scope=*/*}:analyzeIamPolicy
The URL uses gRPC Transcoding syntax.
Path parameters
Parameters
analysisQuery.scope
string
Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within the scope will be analyzed.
This can only be an organization number (such as "organizations/123"), a folder number (such as "folders/123"), a project ID (such as "projects/my-project-id"), or a project number (such as "projects/12345").
To know how to get organization ID, visit here .
To know how to get folder or project ID, visit here .
Authorization requires one or more of the following IAM permissions on the specified resource scope :
cloudasset.assets.analyzeIamPolicy
cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources
cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies
Query parameters
Parameters
analysisQuery.resourceSelector
object ( ResourceSelector )
Optional. Specifies a resource for analysis.
analysisQuery.identitySelector
object ( IdentitySelector )
Optional. Specifies an identity for analysis.
analysisQuery.accessSelector
object ( AccessSelector )
Optional. Specifies roles or permissions for analysis. This is optional.
analysisQuery.options
object ( Options )
Optional. The query options.
analysisQuery.conditionContext
object ( ConditionContext )
Optional. The hypothetical context for IAM conditions evaluation.
savedAnalysisQuery
string
Optional. The name of a saved query, which must be in the format of:
projects/projectNumber/savedQueries/savedQueryId
folders/folder_number/savedQueries/savedQueryId
organizations/organization_number/savedQueries/savedQueryId
If both analysisQuery and savedAnalysisQuery are provided, they will be merged together with the savedAnalysisQuery as base and the analysisQuery as overrides. For more details of the merge behavior, refer to the MergeFrom page.
Note that you cannot override primitive fields with default value, such as 0 or empty string, etc., because we use proto3, which doesn't support field presence yet.
executionTimeout
string ( Duration format)
Optional. Amount of time executable has to complete. See JSON representation of Duration .
If this field is set with a value less than the RPC deadline, and the execution of your query hasn't finished in the specified execution timeout, you will get a response with partial result. Otherwise, your query's execution will continue until the RPC deadline. If it's not finished until then, you will get a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error.
Default is empty.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with ' s '. Example: "3.5s" .
Request body
The request body must be empty.
Response body
A response message for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy .
If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

Represents whether all entries in the mainAnalysis and serviceAccountImpersonationAnalysis have been fully explored to answer the query in the request.
Authorization scopes
Requires the following OAuth scope:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
For more information, see the Authentication Overview .
IamPolicyAnalysis
An analysis message to group the query and results.
JSON representation

{
object ( IamPolicyAnalysisResult )
}
] ,
"fullyExplored" : boolean ,
"nonCriticalErrors" : [
{
object ( IamPolicyAnalysisState )
}
]
}
Fields
analysisQuery
object ( IamPolicyAnalysisQuery )
The analysis query.
analysisResults[]
object ( IamPolicyAnalysisResult )
A list of IamPolicyAnalysisResult that matches the analysis query, or empty if no result is found.
fullyExplored
boolean
Represents whether all entries in the analysisResults have been fully explored to answer the query.
nonCriticalErrors[]
object ( IamPolicyAnalysisState )
A list of non-critical errors happened during the query handling.
IamPolicyAnalysisResult
IAM Policy analysis result, consisting of one IAM policy binding and derived access control lists.
JSON representation
{
"attachedResourceFullName" : string ,
"iamBinding" : {
object ( Binding )
} ,
"accessControlLists" : [
{
object ( AccessControlList )
}
] ,
"identityList" : {
object ( IdentityList )
} ,
"fullyExplored" : boolean
}
Fields
attachedResourceFullName
string
The full resource name of the resource to which the iamBinding policy attaches.
iamBinding
object ( Binding )
The IAM policy binding under analysis.
accessControlLists[]
object ( AccessControlList )
The access control lists derived from the iamBinding that match or potentially match resource and access selectors specified in the request.
identityList
object ( IdentityList )
The identity list derived from members of the iamBinding that match or potentially match identity selector specified in the request.
fullyExplored
boolean
Represents whether all analyses on the iamBinding have successfully finished.
AccessControlList
An access control list, derived from the above IAM policy binding, which contains a set of resources and accesses. May include one item from each set to compose an access control entry.
NOTICE that there could be multiple access control lists for one IAM policy binding. The access control lists are created based on resource and access combinations.
For example, assume we have the following cases in one IAM policy binding: - Permission P1 and P2 apply to resource R1 and R2; - Permission P3 applies to resource R2 and R3;
This will result in the following access control lists: - AccessControlList 1: [R1, R2], [P1, P2] - AccessControlList 2: [R2, R3], [P3]

cause
string
The human-readable description of the cause of failure.
Code
The canonical error codes for gRPC APIs.
Sometimes multiple error codes may apply. Services should return the most specific error code that applies. For example, prefer OUT_OF_RANGE over FAILED_PRECONDITION if both codes apply. Similarly prefer NOT_FOUND or ALREADY_EXISTS over FAILED_PRECONDITION .
Enums
OK
Not an error; returned on success.
HTTP Mapping: 200 OK
CANCELLED
The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller.
HTTP Mapping: 499 Client Closed Request
UNKNOWN
Unknown error. For example, this error may be returned when a Status value received from another address space belongs to an error space that is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to this error.
HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
INVALID_ARGUMENT
The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from FAILED_PRECONDITION . INVALID_ARGUMENT indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., a malformed file name).
HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
DEADLINE_EXCEEDED
The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire.
HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout
NOT_FOUND
Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found.
Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist, NOT_FOUND may be used. If a request is denied for some users within a class of users, such as user-based access control, PERMISSION_DENIED must be used.
HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found
ALREADY_EXISTS
The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file or directory) already exists.
HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
PERMISSION_DENIED
The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. PERMISSION_DENIED must not be used for rejections caused by exhausting some resource (use RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead for those errors). PERMISSION_DENIED must not be used if the caller can not be identified (use UNAUTHENTICATED instead for those errors). This error code does not imply the request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies other pre-conditions.
HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
UNAUTHENTICATED
The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation.
HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized
RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests
FAILED_PRECONDITION
The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between FAILED_PRECONDITION , ABORTED , and UNAVAILABLE : (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.
HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
ABORTED
The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.
See the guidelines above for deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION , ABORTED , and UNAVAILABLE .
HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
OUT_OF_RANGE
The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file.
Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT , this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current file size.
There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and OUT_OF_RANGE . We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when they are done.
HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
UNIMPLEMENTED
The operation is not implemented or is not supported/enabled in this service.
HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented
INTERNAL
Internal errors. This means that some invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved for serious errors.
HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
UNAVAILABLE
The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent operations.
See the guidelines above for deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION , ABORTED , and UNAVAILABLE .
HTTP Mapping: 503 Service Unavailable
DATA_LOSS
Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
