Measure vector query recall
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to measure vector query recall in AlloyDB for PostgreSQL. In
the context of vector search, recall refers to the percentage of vectors
that the index returns which are true nearest neighbors. For example, if
a nearest neighbor query for the 20 nearest neighbors returns 19 of the ground
truth nearest neighbors, then the recall is 19/20x100 = 95%.
In a vector query, recall is important because it measures the percentage of
relevant results retrieved from a search. Recall helps you evaluate the accuracy
of the results from an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search as compared to
the results from a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) search.
ANN is an algorithm that finds data points similar to a
given query point, and it improves speed by finding the approximate neighbors
as opposed to actual neighbors. When you use ANN, you balance speed with recall.
KNN is an algorithm that finds
the "k" most similar vectors to a given query vector within a dataset, based on
a similarity metric. k is the number of neighbors that you want the query to return.
You can measure the recall of your vector search query for different vector
indexes, including the following:
Scalable Nearest Neighbors (ScaNN): an algorithm for efficient vector
similarity search.
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW): a graph-based algorithm used
for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search in vector databases.
Inverted File with Flat Compression (IVFFLAT) and Inverted File Flat (IVF):
types of vector indexes that are used for ANN searches, particularly in databases
like the PostgreSQL pgvector extension.
This page assumes that you're familiar with PostgreSQL, AlloyDB,
and vector search.
Before you begin
Install or update the pgvector extension.
If the pgvector extension isn't installed, install the
vector extension version 0.8.0.google-3 or later to store
generated embeddings as vector values. The vector extension
includes pgvector functions and operators. Google extends this
version of pgvector with optimizations for AlloyDB.
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector WITH VERSION '0.8.0.google-3' ;
For more information, see Create indexes .
If the pgvector extension is already installed, upgrade the
vector extension to version 0.8.0.google-3 or later to get recall
evaluator capabilities.
ALTER EXTENSION vector UPDATE TO '0.8.0.google-3' ;
To create ScaNN indexes, install the alloydb_scann extension.
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS alloydb_scann ;
Evaluate recall for vector queries on a vector index
You can find the recall for a vector query on a vector index for a given
configuration using the evaluate_query_recall function. This function lets you tune
your parameters to achieve the vector query recall results that you want.
Recall is the metric used for search quality, and is defined as the
percentage of the returned results that are objectively closest to the
query vectors. The evaluate_query_recall function is turned on by default.
Note: Improved recall can result in slower query execution (QPS).
Find the recall for a vector query
Open a SQL editor in
AlloyDB Studio
or open a psql client .
Create a ScaNN, HNSW, or IVFFLAT vector index .
Note: You can create indexes of different methods on a single
vector column and compare the performance of your query using each of
the created indexes. This is recommended for developmental
workloads only.
Ensure that the enable_indexscan flag
is on. If the flag is off, no index scan is chosen and the recall for all
indexes is 1.
Run the evaluate_query_recall
function, which takes in the query as a parameter and returns the
following recall:
SELECT * FROM evaluate_query_recall ( QUERY_TEXT , QUERY_TIME_CONFIGURATIONS , INDEX_METHODS )
Before you run this command, make the following replacements:
QUERY_TEXT : the SQL query,
enclosed in $$ .
QUERY_TIME_CONFIGURATIONS : Optional: the configuration
that you can set for the ANN query. This must be in JSON format.
The default value is NULL .
INDEX_METHODS : Optional: a text array that contains
different vector index methods for which you want to calculate the
recall. If you set an index method for which a corresponding index
doesn't exist, the recall is 1 . The input must be a subset of
{scann, hnsw, ivf, ivfflat} . If no value is provided, the ScaNN
method is used.
To view differences between query recall and execution time, change the
query time parameters for your index.
The following table lists query time parameters for ScaNN, HNSW, and IVF/IVFFLAT
index methods. The parameters are formatted as
{"scann.num_leaves_to_search":1, "scann.pre_reordering_num_neighbors":10, "hnsw.ef_search": 1} .
Index type
Parameters
ScaNN
scann.num_leaves_to_search
scann.pre_reordering_num_neighbors
scann.pct_leaves_to_search
scann.num_search_threads
HNSW
hnsw.ef_search
hnsw.iterative_scan
hnsw.max_scan_tuples
hnsw.scan_mem_multiplier
IVF
ivf.probes
ivf.iterative_scan
ivf.max_probes
IVFFLAT
ivfflat.probes
ivfflat.iterative_scan
ivfflat.max_probes
For more information about ScaNN index methods, see
AlloyDB ScaNN Index reference .
For more information about HNSW and IVF/IVFFLAT index methods, see
pgvector .
Optional: You can also add configurations from pg_settings to the
QUERY_TIME_CONFIGURATIONS . For example, to run a query with columnar
engine scan enabled, add the following config from pg_settings as
{"google_columnar_engine.enable_columnar_scan" : on} .
The configurations are set locally in the function. Adding these
configurations doesn't impact the configurations that you set in your
session. If you don't set any configurations, AlloyDB uses
all of the configurations that you set in the session. You can also set
only those configurations that are best suited for your use case.
Optional: To view the default configuration settings, run the SHOW command
or view the pg_settings .
Optional: If you have a ScaNN index for which you want to tune the recall, see the
tuning parameters in ScaNN index reference .
The following is an example output, where ann_execution_time is the time
that it takes a vector query to execute using index scans.
ground_truth_execution_time is the time that it takes the query to run
using a sequential scan.
ann_execution_time and ground_truth_execution_time are different
from but directly dependent on Execution time in the query plan.
Execution time is the total time to execute the query from the client.
t=# SELECT * FROM evaluate_query_recall( $$ SELECT id FROM t1 ORDER BY val <=> '[1000,1000,49000]' LIMIT 10 $$, '{"scann.num_leaves_to_search":1, "scann.pre_reordering_num_neighbors":10, "hnsw.ef_search": 1}', ARRAY['scann', 'hnsw']);
NOTICE: Recall is 1. This might mean that the vector index is not present on the table or index scan not chosen during query execution.
id| query | configurations | recall |ann_execution_time | ground_truth_execution_time | index_type
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+--------------------+-----------------------------+------------
1 | SELECT id FROM t1 ORDER BY val <=> '[1000,1000,49000]' LIMIT 10 | {"scann.num_leaves_to_search":1, "scann.pre_reordering_num_neighbors":10, "hnsw.ef_search": 1} | 0.5 | 4.23 | 118.211 | scann
2 | SELECT id FROM t1 ORDER BY val <=> '[1000,1000,49000]' LIMIT 10 | {"scann.num_leaves_to_search":1, "scann.pre_reordering_num_neighbors":10, "hnsw.ef_search": 1} | 1 | 107.198 | 118.211 | hnsw
(2 rows)
If the result is Recall is 1 (recall of the query is
1 ), this might indicate that the vector index isn't present on the table or
that the vector index wasn't chosen during query execution. This situation occurs
when no vector index exists on the table or when the planner doesn't choose the
vector index scan.
Note: Don't use columns in queries whose value may result in NULL values. If
those columns are required, add the COALESCE function to the query.
If the query is select id, name from table order by embedding <->'[1,2,3]' LIMIT 10;.
and the expected value of the column name is NULL , then change the
query to one of the following:
select id , COALESCE ( name , 'NULL' ) as name from table order by embedding < - > '[1,2,3]' LIMIT 10 ;
Or
select id from table order by embedding < - > '[1,2,3]' LIMIT 10 ;
