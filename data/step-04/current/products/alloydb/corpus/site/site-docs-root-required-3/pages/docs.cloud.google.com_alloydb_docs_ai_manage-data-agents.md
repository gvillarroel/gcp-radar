This document describes how to create context sets in AlloyDB for PostgreSQL Studio using a context set file. Context set names must be unique within a database.
To learn about context sets, see Context sets overview .
Before you begin
Complete the following prerequisites before creating an agent.
Enable required services
Enable the following services for your project:
Data Analytics API with Gemini
Gemini for Google Cloud API
Knowledge Catalog API
Prepare an AlloyDB for PostgreSQL cluster, instance, and database
Make sure that you have access to an existing AlloyDB cluster and
instance or create a new one .
This tutorial requires you to have a database in your AlloyDB instance.
For more information, see Create a database .
Required roles and permissions
Add an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or service account to the cluster at the database
level. For more information, see Manage
database users .
Grant the alloydb.databaseUser , the
serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer , and the geminidataanalytics.queryDataUser
roles to the IAM user at the
project level. For more information, see Add
IAM policy binding for a project .
Grant executesql permission to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL instance
To grant the executesql permission to the AlloyDB for PostgreSQL instance and set
the data_api_access instance setting to the value ALLOW_DATA_API ,
use the following curl command :
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https://alloydb.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /clusters/ CLUSTER_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_ID ?updateMask=dataApiAccess \
-d '{
"dataApiAccess": "ENABLED",
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The ID of your Google Cloud project.
LOCATION : The region where your AlloyDB cluster is located.
CLUSTER_ID : The ID of your AlloyDB cluster.
INSTANCE_ID : The ID of your AlloyDB instance.
To perform steps in this tutorial, sign in to Google Cloud , and then authenticate to the database
using IAM authentication.
Create a context set
To create a context set, perform the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the AlloyDB page.
Go to AlloyDB
Select a cluster from the list.
In the navigation menu, click AlloyDB Studio .
Sign in to Studio using IAM authentication.
In the Explorer pane , next to Context sets , click View actions .
Click Create context set .
In Context set name , provide a unique context set name. The context set name is case-sensitive and can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
Optional. In Context set description , add a description for your context set.
Click Create .
Note: Creating the first context set in a project can take several minutes.
Build context sets
After creating a context set, follow the steps in Build contexts using Gemini CLI to create a context set file. You can then edit your context set to upload the context set file.
Edit a context set
To edit a context set, perform the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the AlloyDB page.
Go to AlloyDB
Select a cluster from the list.
In the navigation menu, click AlloyDB Studio .
Sign in to Studio using Identity and Access Management authentication.
In the Explorer pane , next to Context sets , click View actions .
Click Edit context set .

Go to AlloyDB
Select a cluster from the list.
In the navigation menu, click AlloyDB Studio .
Sign in to Studio using Identity and Access Management authentication.
In the Explorer pane , next to Context sets , click View actions .
Click Delete context set .
In the Delete context set confirmation dialog, enter the name of the context set.
Click Confirm to delete the context set.
Note: Before you delete a database, you must delete all context sets associated with that database.
