Message describing Backup object
Attributes
Name
Description
name
str
Output only. The name of the backup resource with the
format:
- projects/{project}/locations/{region}/backups/{backup_id}
where the cluster and backup ID segments should satisfy
the regex expression [a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])? ,
e.g. 1-63 characters of lowercase letters, numbers, and
dashes, starting with a letter, and ending with a letter
or number. For more details see
https://google.aip.dev/122. The prefix of the backup
resource name is the name of the parent resource:
- projects/{project}/locations/{region}
display_name
str
User-settable and human-readable display name
for the Backup.
uid
str
Output only. The system-generated UID of the
resource. The UID is assigned when the resource
is created, and it is retained until it is
deleted.
create_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. Create time stamp
update_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. Update time stamp
Users should not infer any meaning from this
field. Its value is generally unrelated to the
timing of the backup creation operation.
delete_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. Delete time stamp
create_completion_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. Timestamp when the resource
finished being created.
labels
MutableMapping[str, str]
Labels as key value pairs
state
google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Backup.State
Output only. The current state of the backup.
type_
google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Backup.Type
The backup type, which suggests the trigger
for the backup.
description
str
User-provided description of the backup.
cluster_uid
str
Output only. The system-generated UID of the
cluster which was used to create this resource.
cluster_name
str
Required. The full resource name of the backup source
cluster (e.g.,
projects/{project}/locations/{region}/clusters/{cluster_id}).
reconciling
bool
Output only. Reconciling
(https://google.aip.dev/128#reconciliation), if
true, indicates that the service is actively
updating the resource. This can happen due to
user-triggered updates or system actions like
failover or maintenance.
encryption_config
google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.EncryptionConfig
Optional. The encryption config can be
specified to encrypt the backup with a
customer-managed encryption key (CMEK). When
this field is not specified, the backup will
then use default encryption scheme to protect
the user data.
encryption_info
google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.EncryptionInfo
Output only. The encryption information for
the backup.
etag
str
For Resource freshness validation
(https://google.aip.dev/154)
annotations
MutableMapping[str, str]
Annotations to allow client tools to store
small amount of arbitrary data. This is distinct
from labels. https://google.aip.dev/128
size_bytes
int
Output only. The size of the backup in bytes.
expiry_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. The time at which after the backup is eligible
to be garbage collected. It is the duration specified by the
backup's retention policy, added to the backup's
create_time.
expiry_quantity
google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.Backup.QuantityBasedExpiry
Output only. The QuantityBasedExpiry of the
backup, specified by the backup's retention
policy. Once the expiry quantity is over
retention, the backup is eligible to be garbage
collected.
satisfies_pzs
bool
Output only. Reserved for future use.
database_version
google.cloud.alloydb_v1.types.DatabaseVersion
Output only. The database engine major
version of the cluster this backup was created
from. Any restored cluster created from this
backup will have the same database version.
tags
MutableMapping[str, str]
Optional. Input only. Immutable. Tag keys/values directly
bound to this resource. For example:
::
"123/environment": "production",
"123/costCenter": "marketing".
Classes
AnnotationsEntry
AnnotationsEntry ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
The abstract base class for a message.
Parameters
Name
Description
kwargs
dict
Keys and values corresponding to the fields of the message.
mapping
Union[dict, .Message ]
A dictionary or message to be used to determine the values for this message.
ignore_unknown_fields
Optional(bool)
If True, do not raise errors for unknown fields. Only applied if mapping is a mapping type or there are keyword parameters.
LabelsEntry
LabelsEntry ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
The abstract base class for a message.
Parameters
Name
Description
kwargs
dict
Keys and values corresponding to the fields of the message.
mapping
Union[dict, .Message ]
A dictionary or message to be used to determine the values for this message.
ignore_unknown_fields
Optional(bool)
If True, do not raise errors for unknown fields. Only applied if mapping is a mapping type or there are keyword parameters.
QuantityBasedExpiry
QuantityBasedExpiry ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
A backup's position in a quantity-based retention queue, of backups
with the same source cluster and type, with length, retention,
specified by the backup's retention policy. Once the position is
greater than the retention, the backup is eligible to be garbage
collected.
Example: 5 backups from the same source cluster and type with a
quantity-based retention of 3 and denoted by backup_id (position,
retention).
Safe: backup_5 (1, 3), backup_4, (2, 3), backup_3 (3, 3). Awaiting
garbage collection: backup_2 (4, 3), backup_1 (5, 3)
