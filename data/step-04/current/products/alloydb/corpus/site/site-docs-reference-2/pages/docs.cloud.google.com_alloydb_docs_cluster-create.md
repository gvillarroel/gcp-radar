Create a cluster and its primary instance
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to perform a complete AlloyDB for PostgreSQL cluster setup.
You learn how to create a new AlloyDB cluster and its primary instance using
the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, the REST API, or Terraform.
Before you begin
The Google Cloud project you are using must be
enabled to access AlloyDB .
A VPC network in the Google Cloud project that you are using must already
be configured for private services access to AlloyDB.
For development and sandbox workloads, consider your region and machine type.
To use the 1 vCPU shape, make sure that you select a region
that supports that shape. For more information, see
Considerations when using 1 vCPU .
Required roles
Before you can create your first postgres cluster, you must have the correct
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.
You must have one of these IAM roles in the
Google Cloud project that you're using:
roles/alloydb.admin (the AlloyDB Admin
predefined IAM role)
roles/owner (the Owner basic IAM role)
roles/editor (the Editor basic IAM role)
If you don't have any of these roles, contact your Organization
Administrator to request access.
You must also have the compute.networks.list permission in the
Google Cloud project you are using. To gain this permission while
following the principle of least privilege, ask your administrator to grant
you the Compute Network User ( roles/compute.networkUser ) role.
Create a new cluster and primary instance
Console
Go to the Clusters page.
Go to Clusters
Click Create cluster .
Choose a cluster configuration. For more information about the difference between
highly available and basic configurations, see Nodes and instances .
If you're not sure whether your new cluster needs read pool instances,
choose one of the configurations with no read pools. You can add read pool
instances to the cluster later, whenever needed.
Click Continue .
In the Configure your cluster section, in the Cluster ID field, enter an ID for your cluster.
In the Password field, enter an initial password for the new cluster. AlloyDB
assigns the provided password to the postgres database user while creating the cluster.
Optional: To set the alloydb.iam_authentication flag manually, deselect Create an IAM database user .
For more information, see Edit an instance .
By default, Create an IAM database user is selected, which does the following:
Enables the alloydb.iam_authentication flag on the primary instance.
Creates an IAM database user for you.
In the Database version field, select the major version of PostgreSQL for your new AlloyDB cluster.
Select a region. For developmental and sandbox workloads, consider the
1 vCPU shape,
which is available in selected regions. For more information,
see Considerations when using 1 vCPU .
Select a network path.
Optional: To apply a specific IP address range to this cluster, instead of
allowing AlloyDB to choose an IP address range, follow these steps:
Click Show allocated IP range option .
From the Allocated IP range list, select an IP address range.
For more information about this option, see Create a cluster with a
specific IP address range .
Optional: To encrypt this cluster using a customer-managed
encryption key (CMEK) instead of Google-managed
encryption, follow these additional steps:
Click Advanced encryption options .
Select Customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) .
In the menu that appears, select a customer-managed key.
The Google Cloud console limits this list to keys within the
same Google Cloud project and region as the new cluster.
To use a key that is not on this list, click Don't see your
key? Enter key resource name , and then type the key's
resource name into the resulting dialog.
Note that using CMEK with AlloyDB requires some
additional setup. For more information, see Using CMEK with
AlloyDB .
Click Continue .
Configure your primary instance:
In the Instance ID field, enter an ID for your primary
instance.
Select one of the following machine series:
C4A (Google Axion-based machine series).
N2 (x86-based machine series). This is the default machine series.
C4 (x86-based machine series).
Z3 (Intel Xeon-based machine series).
Select a machine type. For more information, see Choose a machine type .
C4A supports 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, 64, and 72 vCPUs.
N2 supports 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 96, and 128 vCPUs.
C4 supports 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96, 144, 192, and 288 vCPUs.
Z3 supports 8, 14, 16, 22, 32, 44, and 88 vCPUs.
For more information about using C4A Axion-based machine series, including
the 1 vCPU machine type
see Considerations when using the C4A Axion-based machine series .
Optional: Set custom flags for your instance. For each flag,
follow these steps:
Click Add flag .
In the New database flag list, select a flag.
Provide a value for the flag.
Click Done .
Click Create cluster .
Note: After you create your cluster, you can monitor cluster and
instance health using prioritized health issues in the Google Cloud console.
For more information, see Monitor the health of your AlloyDB clusters and instances .
gcloud
To use the gcloud CLI, you can
install and initialize the Google Cloud CLI, or you
can use Cloud Shell .
You must create both an AlloyDB cluster and primary instance before you start using AlloyDB.
Create a cluster
To create the cluster with either private service access or Private Service Connect enabled, use the
gcloud alloydb clusters create command.
Private services access
gcloud alloydb clusters create CLUSTER_ID \
--database-version = POSTGRES_ VERSION \
--password = PASSWORD \
--region = REGION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--network = NETWORK
Private Service Connect
gcloud alloydb clusters create CLUSTER_ID \
--database-version = POSTGRES_ VERSION \
--password = PASSWORD \
--region = REGION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--enable-private-service-connect
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_ID : the ID of the cluster
that you are creating. It must begin with a lowercase letter and
can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
VERSION : the major version of PostgreSQL that you want the cluster's
database servers to be compatible with. Choose one of the following:
14 , for compatibility with PostgreSQL 14
15 , for compatibility with PostgreSQL 15
16 , for compatibility with PostgreSQL 16
17 , for compatibility with PostgreSQL 17, which is the default PostgreSQL version supported
18 , for compatibility with PostgreSQL 18
PASSWORD : the password to use for
the default postgres user.
NETWORK (Optional): the name of the
VPC network that you configured for private services
access to
AlloyDB. If you omit the --network flag,
AlloyDB uses the default network.
In case of Shared VPC network, set to the fully qualified path
of the VPC network—for example,
projects/cymbal-project/global/networks/shared-vpc-network .
--enable-private-service-connect (Optional): set to
enable Private Service Connect as the connectivity method for the
cluster and its instances.
REGION_ID : the region where you want
the cluster placed.
Note: For developmental and sandbox workloads, consider the
1 vCPU shape,
which is available in selected regions. For more information,
see Considerations when using 1 vCPU .
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project
where you want the cluster placed.
This command initiates a long-running operation, returning an
operation ID.
Optional: To apply a specific IP address range to this cluster, instead
of allowing AlloyDB to choose an IP address range, provide the following
argument:
--allocated-ip-range-name= RANGE
Replace RANGE with the name of the IP address range
that you want this cluster to use for private services access.
For more information about this option, see Create a cluster with a
specific IP address range .
Optional: To encrypt this cluster using a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK)
instead of the default Google-managed encryption, provide the following
arguments:
--kms-key= KEY_ID \
--kms-keyring= KEYRING_ID \
--kms-location= LOCATION_ID \
--kms-project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
KEY_ID : the ID of the CMEK key to use.
KEYRING_ID : the ID of the key's key ring.
LOCATION_ID : the ID of the
key ring's region, which must be the same as the cluster's
region.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the key ring's project.
Note: Using CMEK requires some additional setup.
For more information, see
Using CMEK with AlloyDB .
Confirm that the operation was successful.
gcloud alloydb operations describe OPERATION_ID \
--region = REGION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace OPERATION_ID with the operation ID that was
returned from the previous step.
After creating the primary cluster, you must create a primary instance.
Create a primary instance
To create a primary instance, use the gcloud alloydb instances create
command.
gcloud alloydb instances create INSTANCE_ID \
--instance-type = PRIMARY \
--region = REGION_ID \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--cpu-count = CPU_COUNT \
--machine-type = MACHINE_TYPE \
--allowed-psc-projects = ALLOWED_PROJECT_LIST
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_ID : the ID of the instance you are
creating. It must begin with a lowercase letter and can contain
lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
REGION_ID : the region where you want the instance
located.
CLUSTER_ID : the ID of the cluster you created
earlier.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where your cluster was created.
CPU_COUNT : the number of vCPUs that you want
for the instance.
You must specify either cpu_count or machine_type .
If only cpu_count is provided, an N2 instance is created with the
following specifications:
2: 2 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM
4: 4 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM
8: 8 vCPUs, 64 GB RAM
16: 16 vCPUs, 128 GB RAM
32: 32 vCPUs, 256 GB RAM
64: 64 vCPUs, 512 GB RAM
96: 96 vCPUs, 768 GB RAM
128: 128 vCPUs, 864 GB RAM
If both machine_type and cpu_count are provided, the cpu_count
value must align with the number of vCPUs specified in the machine_type .
For example, if machine_type is n2-highmem-4 , then you must set cpu_count
to 4 .
MACHINE_TYPE : Select from a list of supported machine-types such as n2-highmem-4 , c4-highmem-4-lssd , or c4a-highmem-4-lssd . For more information, see Choose an AlloyDB machine type.
When you use machine_type and cpu_count together, the values in
cpu_count and machine_type must match. For example, if machine_type
is n2-highmem-4 , then you must set cpu_count to 4 .
ALLOWED_PROJECT_LIST : (Optional) if you're using
Private Service Connect, ALLOWED_PROJECT_LIST
is the comma-separated list of project IDs or the project number
that you want to allow access the instance.
Terraform
Create a cluster and a primary instance
To create a cluster and its primary instance, use a Terraform resource .
The following is a code snippet for creating a cluster and a primary instance
based on the AlloyDB instance full example:
resource "google_alloydb_instance" "default" {
cluster = google_alloydb_cluster.default.name
instance_id = "alloydb-instance"
instance_type = "PRIMARY"
machine_config {
cpu_count = 2
}
depends_on = [google_service_networking_connection.vpc_connection]
}
resource "google_alloydb_cluster" "cluster_abc" {
cluster_id = "alloydb-cluster"
location = "us-central1"
network_config {
network = google_compute_network.default.id
}
database_version = "POSTGRES_16"
initial_user {
password = "alloydb-cluster"
}
}
data "google_project" "project" {}
resource "google_compute_network" "default" {
name = "alloydb-network"
}
resource "google_compute_global_address" "private_ip_alloc" {
name = "alloydb-cluster"
address_type = "INTERNAL"
purpose = "VPC_PEERING"
prefix_length = 16
network = google_compute_network.default.id
}
resource "google_service_networking_connection" "vpc_connection" {
network = google_compute_network.default.id
service = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
reserved_peering_ranges = [google_compute_global_address.private_ip_alloc.name]
}
This example creates an N2 instance. For a list of other supported machine-types such as n2-highmem-4 , c4-highmem-4-lssd , or c4a-highmem-4-lssd , see Choose an AlloyDB machine type.
Prepare Cloud Shell
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, prepare Cloud Shell as follows:
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory, also called a root module .
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must be a
TF file—for example, main.tf . In this
document, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review the main.tf file and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optional: To use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Review the configuration to confirm that the Terraform updates match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the Apply complete! message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
REST v1
Create a cluster
This example creates a cluster.
For a complete list of parameters for this call, see Method: projects.locations.clusters.create . For information about cluster settings, see View cluster and instance settings .
Don't include sensitive or personally identifiable information in your cluster ID because it's externally visible.
You don't need to include the project ID in the cluster name. This is done automatically where appropriate, for example, in the log files.
To send your request, save the request body in a file named cluster_request.json :
{
"databaseVersion" : "<var>DATABASE_VERSION</var>" ,
"initialUser" : {
"user" : "<var>INITIAL_USERNAME</var>" ,
"password" : "<var>INITIAL_USER_PASSWORD</var>"
},
"labels" : {
"test" : "alloydb-cluster-full"
}
}
Make the following replacements:
DATABASE_VERSION : enum string of the database
version—for example, POSTGRES_17 .
INITIAL_USERNAME : the username that you use for
the default postgres user.
INITIAL_USER_PASSWORD : the password that you use
for the default postgres user.
Use the following HTTP method and URL:
POST https://alloydb.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /clusters?cluster_id= CLUSTER_ID
Make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where you
want the cluster located.
LOCATION_ID : the ID of the cluster's region.
CLUSTER_ID : the ID of the cluster that you create.
The cluster ID must begin with a lowercase letter and can contain
lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
You can use the following curl to execute the preceding request:
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://alloydb.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /clusters?cluster_id= CLUSTER_ID -d @cluster_request.json
Create a primary instance
This example creates a primary instance. For a complete list of parameters for
this call, see Method: projects.locations.clusters.instances.create . For information about cluster settings, see
View cluster and instance settings .
Don't include sensitive or personally identifiable information in your cluster
ID, because it's externally visible. You don't need to include the project ID in
the cluster name because this is done automatically where appropriate
—for example, in the log files.
To send your request, save the following request body in a file named
instance_request.json .
{
"instance_type": "PRIMARY",
"machine_config": {
"cpu_count": " vCPU_COUNT "
}
}
Make the following replacement:
VCPU_COUNT : the number of visible CPU cores on the instance that you want to create.
The preceding example creates an N2 instance with the following specifications:
2: 2 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM
4: 4 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM
8: 8 vCPUs, 64 GB RAM
16: 16 vCPUs, 128 GB RAM
32: 32 vCPUs, 256 GB RAM
64: 64 vCPUs, 512 GB RAM
96: 96 vCPUs, 768 GB RAM
128: 128 vCPUs, 864 GB RAM
The following example shows how to create an instance for a machine type:
machine_config: {
machine_type : MACHINE_TYPE ,
},
Replace MACHINE_TYPE with a supported machine type such as n2-highmem-4 , c4-highmem-4-lssd , or c4a-highmem-4-lssd . For more information about supported machine types, see Choose an AlloyDB machine type.
Use the following HTTP method and URL:
POST https://alloydb.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /clusters/ CLUSTER_ID /instances?instance_id= INSTANCE_ID
Make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where you want the cluster located.
LOCATION_ID : the ID of the cluster's region.
CLUSTER_ID : the ID of the cluster that you create. The ID must begin with
a lowercase letter and it can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
INSTANCE_ID : the name of the primary instance that you want to create.
You can use curl to execute the request, as shown in the following example:
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://alloydb.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /clusters/ CLUSTER_ID /instances?instance_id= INSTANCE_ID -d @instance_request.json
Clone an active cluster
To create a clone of an active cluster, containing a copy of
all the source cluster's data and running in the same region, perform a
point-in-time recovery on that cluster .
You can specify a very recent point in time when doing so—for
example, the first second of the current minute.
This process copies only the source cluster's data into the clone—not
any of the source cluster's configuration. To encrypt the clone's data
using CMEK, you need to specify CMEK details as part of the
point-in-time recovery command, even if the source cluster's data is
already CMEK-encrypted. After the new cluster is created, you need to
add instances, database flags, backup schedules, and
any other configuration necessary to suit your needs.
A cluster created this way exists independently of
its source, with its data having no relationship to the source cluster's
data after the initial duplication has completed. If you want to create
secondary clusters that automatically track and replicate data changes made in
their source clusters, see About cross-region replication .
Create a cluster with a specific IP address range
AlloyDB uses private services access to allow a cluster's
internal resources to communicate with each other. Before you can create
a cluster, your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network must contain at least one IP
address range configured with a private services access connection .
If your VPC network contains more than one IP address range that has
Considerations when using the C4A Axion-based machine series
AlloyDB offers a C4A machine series based on Google Axion,
Google's custom Arm-based processor. C4A virtual machines (VM) are available as
predefined configurations for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, 64, and 72 vCPUs, with up to
576 GB of Double Data Rate 5 (DDR5) memory.
When you choose C4A, keep in mind the following:
To switch an existing N2 instance to a C4A instance, you modify the machine_type
of the current instance using the Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI,
Terraform, or the API.
Don't delete the N2 instance and create a new C4A instance in the same cluster.
C4A is supported in the following regions:
asia-east1
asia-southeast1
europe-west1
europe-west2
europe-west3
europe-west4
us-central1
us-east1
us-east4
Note: For asia-southeast1 , only 1
vCPU is supported.
Considerations when using the 1 vCPU machine type
AlloyDB offers a 1 vCPU shape
with C4A and is intended for development and testing purposes only.
For production workloads, choose two or more vCPUs.
When you choose 1 vCPU, keep the following limitations in mind:
1 vCPU is offered with 8 GB of memory without ultra-fast cache support.
1 vCPU configuration is recommended for development and sandbox environments
with smaller database sizes in the tens of gigabytes. For larger databases
and for production workloads, consider using 2 vCPU or higher.
You can configure with high availability (HA), but no uptime SLAs are offered.
To learn where you can deploy 1 vCPUs, see C4A supported regions .
