Configure the columnar engine
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to enable or disable the columnar engine on
an AlloyDB for PostgreSQL instance. It also covers how to configure an appropriate
initial size for its column store, as well as memory and storage cache settings for optimal performance.
To use the columnar engine when using AlloyDB Omni,
see Enable the columnar engine in AlloyDB Omni .
Each of these actions involves changing the value of a database flag on
one of your AlloyDB instances. For more information about
setting database flags, see Configure an instance's database
flags .
For a conceptual overview of the AlloyDB columnar engine, see
About the AlloyDB columnar engine .
Enable the columnar engine
To use columnar engine on an instance, set the instance's
google_columnar_engine.enabled
flag to on .
After you set this flag, the instance automatically restarts.
For more information about setting database flags in
AlloyDB, see Configure an instance's database flags .
Configure the size of the column store
While the columnar engine is enabled on an instance,
AlloyDB allocates a portion of the instance's memory to
store its columnar data. Dedicating high-speed RAM to your column store
ensures that AlloyDB can access the columnar data as
rapidly as possible.
Memory and storage cache together represent the overall capacity of the columnar engine.
Configure memory for the columnar engine
If the column store becomes larger than the allocated portion of your
instance's memory, AlloyDB automatically uses the
instance's underlying cache layer to store the additional columnar data.
In AlloyDB, you can load both relations, materialized views, and ScaNN indexes into the columnar engine to accelerate query performance.
By default, AlloyDB allocates 30% of
the instance's memory to the column store, and automatically
adjusts the total allocation if you resize the instance. You can modify the
instance's memory to a recommended maximum of 50%, although 70% is allowed.
To find the recommended
columnar engine memory size for your instance, see
Recommend column store memory size .
You can also set the allocation to a fixed and specific size using the
google_columnar_engine.memory_size_in_mb flag.
To have AlloyDB return to the default allocation,
remove the flag from the instance .
For more information on setting or deleting flags, see Configure an
instance's database
flags .
Configure the loading of ScaNN indexes into the columnar engine
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
The columnar engine accelerates vector search when ScaNN indexes are populated into it.
To enable the columnar index cache, set the google_columnar_engine.enable_index_caching flag to on .
To disable this feature, set the flag to off .
Configure storage cache for the columnar engine
You must size the google_columnar_engine.storage_cache_size relative to the google_columnar_engine.memory_size_in_mb setting because the columnar engine memory is used for in-memory metadata for the storage cache. The recommended sizing ratio is approximately 100 to 1000 times the memory size. For example, with a google_columnar_engine.memory_size_in_mb of 1024 (1 GB), you must set google_columnar_engine.storage_cache_size between 100 GB and 1000 GB.
The columnar engine's storage cache is provisioned according to the instance tier.
Note: 1-CPU instance tiers don't have SSDs and cannot utilize storage cache for the columnar engine. Their columnar engine cache size is 0.

Monitor storage cache data for the columnar engine
To view and monitor data about the storage cache of the columnar engine, you
can use the following commands:
Command
Description
SELECT google_columnar_engine_storage_cache_used();
Returns the size of the used columnar engine storage cache.
SELECT google_columnar_engine_storage_cache_available();
Returns the size of the unused columnar engine storage cache.
SHOW google_columnar_engine.storage_cache_size;
Returns the total amount of the configured size of storage cache for the columnar engine.
Enable vectorized join
The columnar engine has a vectorized join feature that can improve
the performance of joins by applying vectorized
processing to qualifying queries.
After you enable the vectorized join, the AlloyDB query
planner has the option to apply the vectorized join operator instead of
the standard PostgreSQL hash join operator. The planner makes this
decision by comparing the cost of executing the query using either
method.
To enable vectorized join on an instance, set the instance's
google_columnar_engine.enable_vectorized_join
flag to on .
For more information about setting database flags, see Configure an
instance's database
flags .
AlloyDB allocates one thread to the vectorized join
feature by default. You can increase the number of threads available to
this feature by setting the
google_columnar_engine.vectorized_join_threads
flag to a larger value.
Manually refresh your columnar engine
By default, when you enable the columnar engine, it is set to automatically refresh the column store
in the background.
Note: In preview , ScaNN indexes aren't automatically refreshed in the columnar engine.
For workloads with a high rate of data modifications such as frequent INSERT , UPDATE , or DELETE operations, you may manually refresh the columnar store after these changes to keep the index up-to-date.
To manually refresh the column engine, run the following SQL query:
SELECT google_columnar_engine_refresh ( ' TABLE_NAME ' );
Replace TABLE_NAME with the name of the table or the materialized view you
want to manually refresh.
Disable the columnar engine
To disable the columbar engine on an instance, set the google_columnar_engine.enabled
flag to off .
For more information about setting database flags in
AlloyDB, see Configure an instance's database flags .
After you set this flag, the instance automatically restarts.
Troubleshoot the columnar engine
If columns don't populate in the columnar engine, then one of the following situations
might be true:
The columns you want to add include an unsupported data type.
The requirements of the columnar engine
aren't met.
To find the cause of this issue, try the following:
Review your instance's
audit logs .
Confirm
that the tables or materialized views in your query are in the columnar engine.
Verify the usage of the columnar engine
using the EXPLAIN
statement.
