Connect from Cloud Run
This quickstart guides you through the process of deploying a sample application on a Cloud Run service
by using the Google Cloud console and a client application. This sample application connects
Cloud Run to AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.
Sample application code
The sample application code for this quickstart is located in the examples/go
directory of the GoogleCloudPlatform/alloydb-auth-proxy
GitHub repository.
The application is written in the Go programming language and serves as a tool
for collecting votes. The main logic is contained in the main.go file, which
starts a web server and handles user requests.
The database connection is configured using environment variables, which you set
up when you create the Cloud Run service. These variables tell the
application how to connect to your AlloyDB instance, including
the database name, user, password, and the instance's IP address. The code uses
these variables to establish a secure connection to your AlloyDB
database.
Code repository
The alloydb-auth-proxy repository contains the AlloyDB Auth Proxy ,
a tool that helps you securely connect to your AlloyDB instances.
The repository also includes related libraries and examples, such as the Go
application used in this quickstart.
You don't need the entire alloydb-auth-proxy project to connect to
AlloyDB from Cloud Run. The cloudshell_open command
clones the entire repository for your convenience, but the only files used to
build the container for this quickstart are located in the examples/go directory.

IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Connect to your instance and create a database
If you are not in your newly created cluster Overview page, then in the Google Cloud console, go to the Clusters page.
Go to Clusters
To display the cluster Overview page, click the my-cluster cluster name.
In the navigation menu, click AlloyDB Studio .
In the Database list on the Sign in to AlloyDB Studio page, select postgres .
In the User drop-down list, select postgres .
In the Password field, enter the password you created in Create a cluster and its primary instance .
Click Authenticate . The Explorer pane displays a list of the objects in your database.
In the Editor 1 tab, create a database:
CREATE DATABASE quickstart_db ;
Click Run . Wait for the Statement executed successfully message to display in the Results pane.
Find your project ID
