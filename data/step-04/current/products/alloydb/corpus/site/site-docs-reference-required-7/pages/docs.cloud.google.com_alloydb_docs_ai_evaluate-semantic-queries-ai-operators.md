Perform intelligent SQL queries using AI functions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
AlloyDB AI functions integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) like
Gemini directly with your AlloyDB for PostgreSQL data to perform intelligent data
operations. This feature includes built-in functions for the following:
Filtering ( ai.if )
Semantic ranking ( ai.rank )
Text generation ( ai.generate )
These AI functions use the AlloyDB AI query engine to help your
application process data using artificial intelligence models at various scales,
from single-row responses to large-scale database operations. You can use the
ai.if , ai.rank , and ai.generate operators to combine
natural language with SQL queries. AlloyDB AI reserves and creates the
ai schema.
Note: Using AI functions with your database can result in charges for
processing and model token usage.
There are three categories of AI functions which differ based on
how they handle input data and memory allocation: scalar, array-based,
and cursor functions. Choosing the right AI function depends on the scale of
your data and your performance requirements. Use the following table to learn
about these functions and their use cases:
Category
Description
Recommended use case
Scalar
Designed for basic, one-to-one processing. Takes a single input and returns a single output.
Use when you want a basic function that provides acceptable performance
for queries that make a small number—less than 50—of scalar function calls.
Array-based
Processes data as an array of rows in a single function call. Takes an array as input and returns array as output.
Use for small-to-medium datasets where the entire array of eligible rows can fit within memory limits. This provides high throughput for set-based operations.
Cursor
Takes a cursor as input and returns a cursor as output.
Use for processing large numbers of rows–for example, 10,000 rows.
Before you begin
Verify that the google_ml_integration extension is installed
and that you're using version 1.5.2 or later. To obtain further performance
benefits with array-based functions, use version 1.5.4 or later.
Verify that the google_ml_integration.enable_ai_query_engine flag is set to on .
Integrate with Vertex AI .
Use a Gemini model that's supported in your region .
Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
is the AI query engine's default model. If you don't specify a
Gemini model in the query, the AI query engine default model is
chosen for the queries.
Integrate with Vertex AI and install the extension
Configure user access to Vertex AI models .
Verify that the latest version of google_ml_integration is installed.
To check the installed version, run the following
command:
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'google_ml_integration' ;
extversion
------------
1 . 5 . 2
( 1 row )
If the extension isn't installed or if the installed version is
earlier than 1.5.2, update the extension.
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS google_ml_integration ;
ALTER EXTENSION google_ml_integration UPDATE ;
If you experience issues when you run the preceding commands, or if the
extension isn't updated to version 1.5.2 after you run the preceding
commands, contact Google Cloud support .
To use the AlloyDB AI query engine functionality, set the
google_ml_integration.enable_ai_query_engine flag to on .
SQL
Enable the AI query engine for the current session.
SET google_ml_integration . enable_ai_query_engine = on ;
Enable features for a specific database across sessions.
ALTER DATABASE DATABASE_NAME SET google_ml_integration . enable_ai_query_engine = 'on' ;
Enable the AI query engine for a specific user across sessions and databases.
ALTER ROLE postgres SET google_ml_integration . enable_ai_query_engine = 'on' ;
Console
To modify the value of the google_ml_integration.enable_ai_query_engine flag, follow the steps
in Configure an instance's database flags .
gcloud
To use the gcloud CLI, you can
install and initialize the Google Cloud CLI, or you
can use Cloud Shell .
You can modify the value of the google_ml_integration.enable_ai_query_engine flag.
For more information, see Configure an instance's database flags .
gcloud alloydb instances update INSTANCE_ID \
--database-flags google_ml_integration.enable_ai_query_engine=on \
--region= REGION_ID \
--cluster= CLUSTER_ID \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Use a Gemini model that's supported in your region
If your AlloyDB for PostgreSQL cluster is in a region where gemini-2.5-flash-lite
isn't supported, you can use one of the other available Gemini models
in your region using the model_id parameter .
Note: Verify model availability in your region. For more information, see
Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite .
Alternatively, you can register a Gemini model endpoint and
provide that model ID to the AI operators. For more information, see
Register and call remote AI models using model endpoint management .
The following example shows how to register another Gemini
endpoint. In this example, this second Gemini endpoint is the
global endpoint for gemini-2.5-flash-lite . You can use this registered model
with AI operators by passing model_id => 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite-global' as an
additional argument.
CALL
google_ml . create_model (
model_id = > 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite-global' ,
model_type = > 'llm' ,
model_provider = > 'google' ,
model_qualified_name = > 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite' ,
model_request_url = > 'https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-flash-lite:generateContent' ,
model_auth_type = > 'alloydb_service_agent_iam'
);
Use Gemini 3.0 models
Some Gemini models, such as gemini-3.0-pro-preview , are available only through the global endpoint. You must register such models as follows:
CALL
google_ml . create_model (
model_id = > 'gemini-3-preview-model' ,
model_request_url = > 'https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/publishers/google/models/gemini-3-pro-preview:generateContent' ,
model_qualified_name = > 'gemini-3-pro-preview' ,
model_provider = > 'google' ,
model_type = > 'llm' ,
model_auth_type = > 'alloydb_service_agent_iam'
);
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project where the
Vertex AI model is available. Note that the
AlloyDB service account must have the Vertex AI User Role in
that project.
After registering the model, you can use it in AI functions as follows:
SELECT ai . generate ( prompt = > 'What is AlloyDB?' , model_id = > 'gemini-3-preview-model' );
Use filters in your queries
AlloyDB AI offers AI-powered SQL functions that let you
use natural language processing and LLMs directly
within your database queries, including the ai.if and ai.rank operators.
Note: if you don't specify a batch size in your queries, the default batch size is 10.
Perform filtering using scalar functions
To evaluate whether a condition stated in natural language is met, use the
ai.if / google_ml.if operator. The function returns boolean true or false
value, and returns false if the output isn't clearly detected.
- Function signature
FUNCTION ai.if(prompt TEXT, model_id VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL) RETURNS bool
The following example shows the use of the ai.if operator as a filter to find
restaurants with more than 500 positive reviews located in cities with a
population greater than 100,000. The example uses restaurant_reviews and
contains data like reviews and city location. The ai.if operator helps you
understand the review sentiment and combine
the locations from the database with Gemini general knowledge
about the population in these locations.
SELECT r . name , r . location_city
FROM restaurant_reviews r
WHERE
AI . IF ( r . location_city || ' has a population OF more than 100,000 AND the following is a positive review; Review: ' || r . review )
GROUP BY r . name , r . location_city
HAVING COUNT ( * ) > 500 ;
The following shows the same example using the model that you registered in
Use a Gemini model that's supported in your region .
SELECT r . name , r . location_city
FROM restaurant_reviews r
WHERE
AI . IF ( r . location_city || ' has a population of more than 100,000 AND the following is a positive review; Review: ' || r . review , model_id = > 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite' )
GROUP BY r . name , r . location_city
HAVING COUNT ( * ) > 500 ;
Perform a join on a query that uses the if operator
To perform a join operation, use the ai.if / google_ml.if operator with join.
The following sample query finds the number of reviews that mention each menu
item from the restaurant menu.
SELECT item_name , COUNT ( * )
FROM menu_items JOIN user_reviews
ON ai . if (
prompt = > 'Does the following user review talk about the menu item mentioned ? review: ' || user_reviews . review_text || ' menu item: ' || item_name )
GROUP BY item_name ;
Perform filtering using array-based functions
The following example identifies restaurants with more than 10 positive
reviews by using an AI model ( gemini-2.5-flash-lite ) to analyze
review sentiment and filter the results. ARRAY_AGG is used to transform
individual rows of data into structured arrays so they can be processed
by the AI model in bulk rather than one row at a time.
WITH initial_arrays AS ( WITH initial_arrays AS (
SELECT
ARRAY_AGG ( r . id ORDER BY r . id ) AS review_ids ,
-- Assuming ai.if takes an array of prompts and returns a boolean array
ai . if (
prompts = > ARRAY_AGG ( 'Is the review positive: ' || r . review ORDER BY r . id )
model_id = > 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite' ,
batch_size = > 20
) AS truth_values
FROM restaurant_reviews r
),
reviews AS (
SELECT
initial_arrays . review_ids [ i ] AS review_id ,
initial_arrays . truth_values [ i ] AS truth_value
FROM
initial_arrays ,
generate_series ( 1 , array_length ( initial_arrays . review_ids , 1 )) AS i
)
SELECT rest_review . city , rest_review . name
FROM restaurant_reviews rest_review JOIN reviews review ON rest_review . id = review . review_id
WHERE review . truth_value = 't'
GROUP BY rest_review . city , rest_review . name
HAVING COUNT ( * ) > 10 ;
Perform filtering using cursors
The following example shows how to filter a large set of restaurant
reviews by streaming them through a cursor.
Note: if you don't specify a batch size, the default batch size is 10.
CREATE TABLE filtered_results ( input text , result bool );
DO $$
DECLARE
prompt_cursor REFCURSOR ;
result_cursor REFCURSOR ;
rec RECORD ;
BEGIN
-- 1. Open a cursor for the input data
OPEN prompt_cursor FOR
SELECT r . location_city || ' has a population of > 100,000 and is a positive review; Review: ' || r . review
FROM restaurant_reviews r ;
-- 2. Call the array-based function using the input cursor
result_cursor : = ai . if (
'Is the given statement true? ' ,
prompt_cursor ,
model_id = > 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite'
);
-- 3. Fetch results from the output cursor and store them
LOOP
FETCH result_cursor INTO rec ;
EXIT WHEN NOT FOUND ;
INSERT INTO filtered_results VALUES ( rec . input , rec . output );
END LOOP ;
CLOSE result_cursor ;
END $$ ;
Text generation and summarization
AlloyDB AI offers text generation operators like scalar
ai.generate and array-based and cursor-based ai.generate .
Perform text generation using scalar functions
The ai.generate function produces text by combining provided data with the
user's prompt.
-- Function Signature
FUNCTION ai . generate ( prompt TEXT , model_id VARCHAR ( 100 ) DEFAULT NULL ) RETURNS TEXT
For example, you can use the following query to generate a concise summary of
each user review.
SELECT
ai . generate (
prompt = > 'Summarize the review in 20 words or less. Review: ' || review ) AS review_summary
FROM user_reviews ;
Perform text generation using array-based functions
The following query uses UNNEST and ai.generate to summarize multiple reviews
efficiently.
SELECT
UNNEST (
ai . generate (
prompts = > ARRAY_AGG ( 'Summarize the review in 20 words or less. Review: ' || review ),
model_id = > 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite' ,
)
) AS review_summary
FROM user_reviews ;
Perform text generation using cursors
To generate summaries or translations for millions of rows without hitting memory
bottlenecks, use batch generation with cursors.
CREATE TABLE summary_results ( summary text );
DO $$
DECLARE
prompt_cursor REFCURSOR ;
summary_cursor REFCURSOR ;
rec RECORD ;
BEGIN
OPEN prompt_cursor FOR SELECT review_text FROM user_reviews ORDER BY id ;
summary_cursor : = ai . generate (
'Summarize the review in 20 words or less. Review:' ,
prompt_cursor ,
);
LOOP
FETCH summary_cursor INTO rec ;
EXIT WHEN NOT FOUND ;
INSERT INTO summary_results VALUES ( rec . output );
END LOOP ;
CLOSE summary_cursor ;
END $$ ;
Score your query results
If you need to sort query results using custom, natural language instructions,
use the ai.rank operator.
Perform scoring using scalar functions
The following function lets you provide a prompt which
describes the ranking criteria and returns a score for each item.
-- Function signature
FUNCTION ai . rank ( prompt TEXT , model_id VARCHAR ( 100 ) DEFAULT NULL ) RETURNS real
For example, the following query gets the top 20 most positive restaurant
reviews, using scores from an LLM.
SELECT review AS top20
FROM user_reviews
ORDER BY ai . rank (
'Score the following review according to these rules:
(1) Score OF 8 to 10 IF the review says the food IS excellent.
(2) 4 to 7 IF the review says the food is ok.
(3) 1 to 3 IF the review says the food is not good. Here is the review:' || review ) DESC
LIMIT 20 ;
Perform scoring using array-based functions
This ai.rank function lets you score and rank query results based on custom
natural language instructions.
FUNCTION ai . rank ( prompts TEXT [], model_id VARCHAR ( 100 ) DEFAULT NULL ) RETURNS real []
The following query uses UNNEST and ai.rank to score multiple reviews
efficiently.
SELECT
UNNEST (
ai . rank (
ARRAY_AGG ( 'Score the following review according to these rules:
(1) Score OF 8 to 10 IF the review says the food IS excellent.
(2) 4 to 7 IF the review says the food is ok.
(3) 1 to 3 IF the review says the food is not good. Here is the review:' || review ),
)
) as review_scores
FROM user_reviews ;
Perform scoring using cursors
This function is used for scoring large datasets without hitting memory limits.
FUNCTION ai . rank ( context TEXT , input_cursor REFCURSOR , model_id VARCHAR ( 100 ) DEFAULT NULL ) RETURNS REFCURSOR
The following example shows you how to score large volumes of text according to
specific natural language criteria.
CREATE TABLE scored_results ( input text , score real );
DO $$
DECLARE
prompt_cursor REFCURSOR ;
score_cursor REFCURSOR ;
rec RECORD ;
BEGIN
OPEN prompt_cursor FOR SELECT review FROM user_reviews ORDER BY id ;
score_cursor : = ai . rank (
'Score the following review: (1) 8-10 if excellent, (2) 4-7 if ok, (3) 1-3 if not good. Review:' ,
prompt_cursor ,
);
LOOP
FETCH score_cursor INTO rec ;
EXIT WHEN NOT FOUND ;
INSERT INTO scored_results VALUES ( rec . input , rec . output );
END LOOP ;
CLOSE score_cursor ;
END $$ ;
