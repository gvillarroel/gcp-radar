launch stage descriptions .
Note: Knowledge Catalog integration with AlloyDB is now enabled by default for all new AlloyDB clusters.
Knowledge Catalog integration is enabled by default for all new AlloyDB clusters, allowing you to search for and manage your AlloyDB for PostgreSQL resources using Knowledge Catalog, a platform that lets you store, manage, and access metadata. This integration helps you discover and understand your AlloyDB metadata, supporting the following use cases:
Analysis: Understand dependencies and assess suitability for various use cases.
Change Management: Track and manage metadata changes effectively.
Schema Evolution: Monitor and plan schema modifications.
Knowledge Catalog automatically retrieves the following metadata
from AlloyDB clusters, instances, databases, tables, columns, and views:
Name
Location (Region)
Labels (for clusters and instances)
Dataplex Integration Enabled (for clusters)
Database Version
Machine CPU Count (for instances)
Availability Type (for instances)
Charset (for databases)
Collation (for databases)
Owner
Description (for table, views, columns, and foreign keys)
Type (for clusters, instances, and machines)
Columns
Data Type
Mode
Primary Key
Foreign Keys
Referenced Table
Column Mappings
Creation Time
Last modification Time
Note: Knowledge Catalog refers to resources in
AlloyDB and in other Google Cloud services as assets . In this
document, AlloyDB resources—clusters, instances, databases,
tables, schemas and views—are called AlloyDB assets . Assets also refer to the resources and their Knowledge Catalog metadata.
Types of metadata discovery
Knowledge Catalog metadata discovery is an automated process that scans
connected data sources—such as AlloyDB—to identify data
assets like tables, views, and databases. Then, Knowledge Catalog extracts technical
metadata from the assets like schemas, descriptions, and locations, into Knowledge Catalog.
This process syncs metadata in near real-time, which keeps the catalog synchronized
with source systems. For AlloyDB, cluster and instance metadata is discovered
by default. Database, schema, table, and view metadata discovery is enabled by
default on new clusters. For clusters created before this default was implemented (February 26, 2026),
manually enable the integration .
Keyword and natural language search
Knowledge Catalog supports keyword and natural language searches.
Keyword search helps you find resources using specific keywords, filters, and a
defined syntax. For example, to view all AlloyDB databases, enter system=AlloyDB AND type=Database .
Natural language search (Preview) uses AI to understand semantic queries. It
helps you find resources using everyday language, eliminating the need for complex syntax. For example, enter a query such as List all AlloyDB tables related to sales .
For more information,
see Search syntax for Knowledge Catalog .
Example: Discovering an AlloyDB database schema
To understand the metadata discovery process, consider the example of
an AlloyDB cluster named user-data-cluster with
Knowledge Catalog integration enabled. Inside this cluster's primary
instance, a database named profiles exists, which contains a table customers
( id , email , signup_date ) and a view active_users ( id , email ).
Because AlloyDB syncs in near real-time to Knowledge Catalog, the following
resources are available:
Clusters
Columns
Databases
Instances
Tables
Views
After discovery is complete, search for these assets— customers
table and active_users —in the Knowledge Catalog
page of the Google Cloud console or by using the API. Then, view their schemas and enrich
them with additional business or operational metadata.
Enrich metadata using aspects
Aspect types are reusable resources that serve as templates for
aspects. Aspect types help avoid duplicating work and creating incomplete aspects.
Create the necessary aspect types using Knowledge Catalog.
After you create custom aspect types, attach aspects to your AlloyDB
assets. Attaching aspects to AlloyDB assets lets you do the following:
Add business metadata to the assets.
Search for assets by business metadata and other custom metadata.
To learn more about creating aspect types and attaching aspects to AlloyDB,
see Manage aspects and enrich metadata .
Metadata discovery workflow
By default, cluster and instance resources are ingested and discoverable. To ingest and discover database, schema, table and view resources,
follow these steps:
Enable the Knowledge Catalog integration for your AlloyDB
cluster using the AlloyDB API if it's not already enabled. This is required for clusters created before February 26, 2026.
Search for your AlloyDB assets using the Knowledge Catalog
search page in the Google Cloud console. For more information, see
Search for resources in Knowledge Catalog .
To add more context to your AlloyDB assets, attach
aspects to your assets. Aspects are custom metadata entries that help with
data governance and analysis. For example, use an aspect to label a
column that contains personally identifiable information (PII).
For more information, see Manage aspects and enrich metadata .
Navigate through your AlloyDB resources following
this hierarchy: Cluster > Database > Schema > Table or View > Column.
This hierarchy provides a detailed view of your data landscape.
For more information, see Search for resources in Knowledge Catalog .

Knowledge Catalog integration data freshness
By default, Knowledge Catalog ingests and discovers cluster and instance resources, and their metadata freshness is near real-time.
The Knowledge Catalog integration for database, schema, table, and view resources is enabled by default when you create a new AlloyDB cluster. To prevent this metadata from syncing, disable the integration .
Enabling the integration activates the export of AlloyDB metadata—such as databases, schemas, and tables—to Cloud Storage buckets for periodic sync or to Pub/Sub topics for near real-time sync, making it available to Knowledge Catalog. This feature is only applicable to primary clusters. Secondary clusters used for cross-region replication don't support Knowledge Catalog integration for database, schema, table, and view metadata.
Note: Resource-level metadata, such as cluster and instance metadata,
is always enabled and can't be disabled.
The metadata freshness for these resources depends on when the cluster was created or restored:
Near real-time: clusters created or restored on or after April 3, 2026, sync metadata to Knowledge Catalog in near real-time. Updates are available in Knowledge Catalog in up to 5 minutes. The extraction process typically takes a few seconds.
Every few hours: clusters created or restored between February 26, 2026, and April 3, 2026 refresh metadata in Knowledge Catalog every few hours. Updates are available in Knowledge Catalog in up to 48 hours. The extraction process typically takes a few minutes, but time to completion depends on the CPU size and the table count.
Note: To upgrade clusters from every few hours to near real-time synchronization, contact Google Cloud Support .
Create AlloyDB with Knowledge Catalog integration disabled
You can control this integration when you create or update a cluster using the Google Cloud CLI or the AlloyDB API :
gcloud
Use the gcloud alloydb clusters create command to create an AlloyDB cluster. If you omit the --enable-dataplex-integration flag, Knowledge Catalog integration is enabled by default for database, schema, table, and view metadata.
For a complete list of parameters for this call, see
gcloud alloydb clusters create .
For information about cluster settings, see
View cluster and instance settings .
Don't include sensitive or personally identifiable information in your cluster
ID because the cluster ID might be visible in various operational contexts, such as system logs, monitoring dashboards, and support communications. You don't need to include the project ID in
the cluster name. The system automatically includes this where appropriate, for example, in
the log files.
To disable Knowledge Catalog integration for database, schema, table, and
view resources, include the --no-enable-dataplex-integration flag:
gcloud alloydb clusters create CLUSTER_ID \
--password = PASSWORD \
--region = REGION \
--no-enable-dataplex-integration
Make the following replacements:
CLUSTER_ID : the ID of the cluster that you create. The
cluster ID must begin with a lowercase letter and can contain lowercase
letters, numbers, and hyphens.
PASSWORD : the password that you use for
the default postgres user.
REGION : the ID of the cluster's region.
REST
Use the POST method to create an AlloyDB cluster. If you omit the dataplexConfig from the request, Knowledge Catalog integration enables by default for database, schema, table, and view metadata.

Enrich AlloyDB assets with aspects
Aspect types are reusable resources that serve as templates for aspects.
Aspect types help avoid duplicating work and creating incomplete aspects.
Create the necessary aspect types using Knowledge Catalog.
After you create custom aspect types, attach aspects to your
AlloyDB assets. Attaching aspects to AlloyDB
assets provides the following capabilities:
Add business metadata to the assets
Search for assets by business metadata and other custom metadata
To learn more about creating aspect types and attaching aspects to AlloyDB,
see Manage aspects and enrich metadata .
Search for AlloyDB assets
Use the Knowledge Catalog search page in the Google Cloud console
to search for AlloyDB assets.
Go to the Knowledge Catalog Search page.
Go to Search
In Choose search platform , select Knowledge Catalog .
In the Filters panel, click Systems , and then select AlloyDB .
Optional. In Type aliases , filter the search results to a
specific type of AlloyDB asset by selecting one or more
of the following type aliases:
Database
Database schema
Cluster
Instance
Service
Table
View
Note: Service is a type alias for an AlloyDB instance.
Use queries to perform keyword search
Use the search field in Knowledge Catalog to perform
keyword search queries. For example, enter system=AlloyDB AND type=Database to view all AlloyDB databases.
For more information,
see Search syntax for Knowledge Catalog .
To view all AlloyDB assets, enter system=AlloyDB .
Then enter specific keywords. For example, to view all AlloyDB databases:
system=AlloyDB AND type=Database
To view all AlloyDB tables, enter the following query:
system=AlloyDB AND type=Table
You can also use parentheses and the logical operators AND and OR for
complex expressions. For more information about the expressions you can use in
the search field, see Search syntax for Knowledge Catalog .
You can directly enter search queries for specific AlloyDB assets into the
search field. The format of the query string is as follows:
type = "projects/dataplex-types/locations/global/entryTypes/ QUERY_STRING "
Replace the following:
QUERY_STRING : use the following list to identify a
query string based on the type of AlloyDB asset that you want
to query:
alloydb-database
alloydb-cluster
alloydb-instance
alloydb-table
alloydb-schema
alloydb-view
An example query might look like the following:
type="projects/1234567890/locations/global/entryTypes/alloydb-cluster"
Search by aspect type
Knowledge Catalog includes a few built-in aspect types that help you perform searches.
To search by aspect type, follow these steps:
In the Aspects panel, click the Add more aspect types menu.
Optional. Select AlloyDB Access to filter the results by
AlloyDB dialect.
Select one or more of the following aspect types to limit the search
results to that type.
AlloyDB Database
AlloyDB Cluster
AlloyDB Instance
AlloyDB View
AlloyDB Schema
AlloyDB Table
Click OK .
In the results table, click the name of the asset to view the metadata
for that asset.
Optional: Enhance or view your assets. You can enhance or view your assets in the following ways:
To add a rich text description
of the asset, click Add in Overview .
To attach an aspect to the asset, click Add in Aspects .
To view member databases for an instance, click the Entry List tab,
and then click Show all children entries in search . If
the Entry List tab doesn't appear, then the cluster has no databases.
View the full details of the asset in Entry details . Click
the entry name to drill down to additional entries.
Natural Language search in AlloyDB
Natural language search (Preview) uses AI to understand semantic queries. It
helps you find resources using everyday language, eliminating the need for

Syntax search in AlloyDB
Keyword search helps you find resources using specific keywords, filters, and a
defined syntax. For example, enter system=AlloyDB AND type=Database
to view all AlloyDB databases.

Example workflow - Drill down from cluster to columns
To drill down from cluster to columns, follow these steps:
Go to the Knowledge Catalog Search page.
Go to Search
For the Choose search platform option, select Knowledge Catalog .
In the Filters panel , select Systems and then AlloyDB .
Alternatively, enter system=AlloyDB in the search field.
Select a cluster name.
On the AlloyDB details page, click the Entry list tab, and then
click Show all children entries in search . Knowledge Catalog
displays the databases in the cluster.
Note: If the Entry list tab doesn't appear, return to the Search
page and choose a different cluster.
On the AlloyDB database details page, click the Entry list tab,
and then click View child entries in search . Knowledge Catalog
displays the tables in the cluster.
Select a table name, and then on the AlloyDB table details page,
click Schema to view the table columns.
Optional: To add an aspect type to a column, click the Add aspect
button.
Pricing
There is no charge for storing AlloyDB technical metadata in Knowledge Catalog.
Standard Knowledge Catalog pricing applies for API calls and
additional business metadata enrichment. For more information, see the
Knowledge Catalog pricing page .
Resource usage
Knowledge Catalog periodically extracts metadata from your AlloyDB clusters. This extraction process consumes CPU resources on your cluster. The CPU usage is generally minimal. For example, clusters with smaller machine types (such as n2-highmem-2-icelake ) that manage large schemas (such as those with 100,000 or more tables) might experience a CPU usage increase of up to 5% during the extraction.
Limitations
The integration supports a maximum of one million tables per database and an average of 150 columns per table. If either of these limits is exceeded, metadata for resources such as databases, schemas, tables, and views is not extracted. Only cluster and instance metadata is available in Knowledge Catalog.
When a cluster is first created, the initial synchronization of all metadata to Knowledge Catalog can take up to 48 hours. After the initial sync, subsequent updates are available in near real-time .
In case of a high rate of metadata changes (over 100 or more DDL changes per second) on your database, Near real-time metadata
synchronization with Knowledge Catalog might pause for up to 30 minutes before resuming.
In the event any update is missed due to high rate of metadata changes, networking issues or when the synchronization process is interrupted, they eventually become visible in
Knowledge Catalog within 48 hours.
When an instance doesn't exist or is not running, it can take 7 days for
metadata to be deleted.
When a database is renamed, only the database update is available in
Knowledge Catalog in near real-time. The underlying mapping of the
database and all the respective tables will be updated in
Knowledge Catalog within 48 hours.
