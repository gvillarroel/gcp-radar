Configure backup plans
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
By default, AlloyDB for PostgreSQL continuously backs up your data with a
14-day recovery window, using Google-managed encryption. This page
describes how to adjust this default behavior in two ways:
Configure continuous backup and recovery.
Enable and configure an additional automated backup schedule.
Before you begin
The Google Cloud project you are using must have been
enabled to access AlloyDB .
You must have one of these IAM roles in the Google Cloud project you are using:
roles/alloydb.admin (the AlloyDB Admin predefined IAM role)
roles/owner (the Owner basic IAM role)
roles/editor (the Editor basic IAM role)
If you don't have any of these roles, contact your Organization Administrator to request
access.
Manage continuous backup and recovery
This section describes the Google Cloud CLI or Google Cloud console commands
that you can use to configure, disable, or re-enable continuous backup and
recovery on your cluster.
Configure continuous backup
You can configure the recovery window and
encryption settings of your cluster's continuous backup system.
If you decrease the recovery window's size, then AlloyDB
immediately shortens the distance into the past that you can perform a
point-in-time recovery. For example, if you reduce the window's size
from 14 days to 7 days, then points in time more than 7 days in the past
become unavailable for recovery.
If you increase the window's size, then the span of time available
for point-in-time recovery grows in real time until it reaches the new
limit that you specified. For example, if you change the window's size from
7 to 14 days, it takes an additional 7 days for the recovery window's
effective size to grow to its new maximum of 14 days into the past.
After configuring the plan, it might take up to 24 hours for continuous
backup and recovery to take a backup and enable its continuous recovery capability.
If you want to accelerate the backup operation without waiting for 24 hours and
to avoid data loss, then you can take an on-demand
backup after you configure the plan.
Console
Go to the Clusters page.
Go to Clusters
Click a cluster in the Resource Name column.
Click Data protection .
Under Continuous backups and recovery policy , click Edit .
In the Recovery window (days) field, enter a new recovery window size.
If you want to encrypt this cluster's continuous backups and
data-change logs using a specific
customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) instead of the cluster's encryption configuration, follow these additional steps:
Click Advanced encryption options .
Click the Customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) radio button.
Click the Select a customer-managed key list, and select a key.
Click Update .
gcloud
To use the gcloud CLI, you can
install and initialize the Google Cloud CLI, or you
can use Cloud Shell .
To configure continuous backup and recovery on a cluster, use the
gcloud alloydb clusters
update
command.
gcloud alloydb clusters update CLUSTER_ID \
--continuous-backup-recovery-window-days = WINDOW_LENGTH \
--region = REGION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_ID : The ID of the cluster.
WINDOW_LENGTH : The length of time, in days, of this cluster's
continuous backup and recovery window. The value must be between 1
and 35 , inclusive.
The value of this argument defines both of the following aspects of
continuous backup and recovery:
The maximum distance into the past, relative to the present, that
you can perform a point-in-time
recovery based on continuous
backups.
The length of time that AlloyDB retains continuous
backups and data-change logs in storage. To ensure that you can
restore to any point in time within your recovery window,
AlloyDB retains backups and logs for one day longer than
the specified value.
This argument is optional. If you do not include it, then
AlloyDB sets the recovery window to 14 days.
REGION_ID : the ID of the region where the cluster is placed.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where the cluster is placed.
If you want to encrypt this cluster's continuous backups and
data-change logs using a specific customer-managed encryption key
(CMEK) instead of the cluster's encryption configuration,
provide these additional arguments:
--continuous-backup-encryption-key= KEY_ID : the ID
of the CMEK key to use.
--continuous-backup-encryption-key-keyring= KEYRING_ID :
the ID of the key's keyring.
--continuous-backup-encryption-key-location= LOCATION_ID :
the ID of the keyring's region. Note that the region you specify
must match the cluster's region.
--continuous-backup-encryption-key-project= PROJECT_ID :
the keyring's project ID.
To use CMEK with AlloyDB, you need to complete
some additional setup steps. For more information, see Using CMEK with
AlloyDB .
Disable continuous backup and recovery
When you disable continuous backup, point-in-time
recovery becomes unavailable for your
cluster. It becomes available again if you re-enable continuous backup,
as described in the next section.
Console
Go to the Clusters page.
Go to Clusters
Click a cluster in the Resource Name column.
Click the Data protection tab.
Under Continuous backups and recovery policy , click Edit .
Clear the Google-managed continuous data protection checkbox.
Click Update .
gcloud
To disable continuous backup and recovery on a cluster, use the
gcloud alloydb clusters
update
command.
gcloud alloydb clusters update CLUSTER_ID \
--no-enable-continuous-backup
--region = REGION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_ID : the ID of the cluster.
REGION_ID : the ID of the region where the cluster is
placed.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where the cluster is
placed.
### Enable continuous backup
If you re-enable continuous backup after previously disabling it,
then point-in-time recovery
becomes available again as well. The recovery window begins with the first subsequent
backup that AlloyDB creates. To make point-in-time
recovery available as soon as possible, create an on-demand backup
right after re-enabling continuous backup. Otherwise, the recovery
window commences with the next daily backup that AlloyDB
takes.
Console
Go to the Clusters page.
Go to Clusters
Click a cluster in the Resource Name column.
Click Data protection .
Under Continuous backups and recovery policy , click Edit .
Select the Google-managed continuous data protection checkbox.
Click Update .
gcloud
To re-enable your cluster's continuous backup configuration after
disabling it, follow the same procedure as reconfiguring continuous
backup , adding an --enable-continuous-backup
argument to the gcloud CLI command:
gcloud alloydb clusters update CLUSTER_ID \
--enable-continuous-backup \
--continuous-backup-recovery-window-days = WINDOW_LENGTH \
--region = REGION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_ID : The ID of the cluster.
WINDOW_LENGTH : The length of time, in days, of this cluster's
continuous backup and recovery window. The value must be between 1
and 35 , inclusive.
The value of this argument defines both of the following aspects of
continuous backup and recovery:
The maximum distance into the past, relative to the present, that
you can perform a point-in-time
recovery based on continuous
backups.
The length of time that AlloyDB retains continuous
backups and data-change logs in storage. To ensure that you can
restore to any point in time within your recovery window,
AlloyDB retains backups and logs for one day longer than
the specified value.
This argument is optional. If you do not include it, then
AlloyDB sets the recovery window to 14 days.
REGION_ID : the ID of the region where the cluster is placed.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where the cluster is placed.
If you want to encrypt this cluster's continuous backups and
data-change logs using a specific customer-managed encryption key
(CMEK) instead of the cluster's encryption configuration,
provide these additional arguments:
--continuous-backup-encryption-key= KEY_ID : the ID
of the CMEK key to use.
--continuous-backup-encryption-key-keyring= KEYRING_ID :
the ID of the key's keyring.
--continuous-backup-encryption-key-location= LOCATION_ID :
the ID of the keyring's region. Note that the region you specify
must match the cluster's region.
--continuous-backup-encryption-key-project= PROJECT_ID :
the keyring's project ID.
To use CMEK with AlloyDB, you need to complete
some additional setup steps. For more information, see Using CMEK with
AlloyDB .
Configure additional automated backups
This section shows how to enable or disable an automated backup schedule on your
cluster that works independently from the continuous backup system. This
includes configuring how often AlloyDB takes these additional
automated backups, and for how long it retains them.
Automated backup configuration attributes
Each AlloyDB cluster can have one customizable automated backup
configuration, which includes the following attributes:
A schedule for taking backups. You can set this to specific days of the week, and at specific times on those days.
A retention policy, expressed either as an amount of time to keep
backups or as a number of backups to keep. By default, AlloyDB retains automated backups for 14 days.
Backups older than the retention policy are subject to automated
deletion. For more information, see Backup retention and
deletion .
The amount of time that AlloyDB waits before
canceling an incomplete attempt to take a new automated backup.
AlloyDB uses a default timeout of one hour.
A data-encryption preference: either the default Google-managed
encryption or a customer-managed encryption key
(CMEK) that you provide.
Enable and configure automated backups
Console
The Google Cloud console lets you enable and disable automated backups, but it
does not let you specify a backup schedule or other configuration.
To do that, use the gcloud CLI instead.
If you enable automated backups on a cluster where you have not
configured this feature, AlloyDB applies a default configuration that schedules
one automated backup per day, with a 14-day retention window, using Google-managed encryption.
Go to the Clusters page.
Go to Clusters
Click a cluster in the Resource Name column.
Click Data protection .
Under Automated backup policy , click Edit .
Select the Automate backups checkbox.
Click Update .
gcloud
To enable automated backups with the gcloud CLI, you must specify a backup schedule. All other
configuration options are optional. AlloyDB applies the
default values listed in the previous section to any configuration
options that you don't explicitly set.
Each time you run this command to define a new automated backup
configuration, AlloyDB completely replaces the cluster's
current configuration with the new one.
To enable automated backups without specifying a complete configuration,
use the Google Cloud console.
Warning: When you run the gcloud alloydb clusters update command to configure automated backups, you replace the cluster's entire existing automated backup policy with the new settings you provide.
Use the
gcloud alloydb clusters update
command to define a schedule for creating automated backups:
gcloud alloydb clusters update CLUSTER_ID \
--automated-backup-days-of-week = DAYS_LIST \
--automated-backup-start-times = UTC_TIMES_LIST \
--region = REGION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_ID : the ID of the cluster you
want to define the schedule for.
DAYS_LIST : a comma-separated list of
one or more days when you want automated backups to be taken. Valid
values are MONDAY ,
TUESDAY ,
WEDNESDAY ,
THURSDAY , FRIDAY ,
SATURDAY , and
SUNDAY .
UTC_TIMES_LIST : a comma-separated list
of one or more times when you want automated-backup operations to
start on the specified days. Specify times in the format
HH :00 on a 24-hour cycle in UTC time.
REGION_ID : the ID of the region where
the cluster is placed.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where
the cluster is placed.
This example sets a cluster to take an automated backup at midnight
UTC on every Monday and Thursday:
gcloud alloydb clusters update my - cluster \
-- automated - backup - days - of - week = MONDAY , THURSDAY \
-- automated - backup - start - times = 00 : 00 \
-- region = us - central1 \
-- project = my - project
To encrypt scheduled backups using a CMEK key instead of the default
Google-managed encryption, provide these additional
arguments:
--automated-backup-encryption-key= KEY_ID :
the ID of the CMEK key to use.
--automated-backup-encryption-key-keyring= KEYRING_ID : the ID of the key's keyring.
--automated-backup-encryption-key-location= LOCATION_ID : the ID of that keyring's region. Note that it must match
the cluster's region.
--automated-backup-encryption-key-project= PROJECT_ID : the keyring's project ID.
To use CMEK with AlloyDB, you need to complete
some additional setup steps. For more information, see Using CMEK with
AlloyDB .
You can also specify the automated backups retention policy, based on
either a duration or a number of backups to keep. To do this,
include either of the following arguments:
To have AlloyDB retain all automated backups for a
certain amount of time, use
--automated-backup-retention-period= DURATION .
Replace DURATION with a duration string, as
described by gcloud topic
datetimes . You can specify a
duration as long as one year.
To have AlloyDB instead retain a certain number of
backups, use
--automated-backup-retention-count= COUNT .
Replace COUNT with the number of automated
backups that AlloyDB should retain for up to one year.
Disable automated backups
Console
Go to the Clusters page.
Go to Clusters
Click a cluster in the Resource Name column.
Click Data protection .
Under Automated backup policy , click Edit .
Clear the Automate backups checkbox.
Click Update .
gcloud
To disable automated backups, use the
gcloud alloydb clusters update
command.
gcloud alloydb clusters update CLUSTER_ID \
--disable-automated-backup \
--region = REGION_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_ID : the ID of the cluster to disable automated backups on.
REGION_ID : the ID of the region where the cluster is placed.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where the cluster is placed.
View backup plans
You can view details about your cluster's
automated or continuous backup plans.
Console
Go to the Clusters page.
Go to Clusters
Click a cluster in the Resource Name column.
Click Data protection .
Find details about the cluster's backup plans in the
Continuous backups and recovery policy and Automated backup policy
tables.
gcloud
Use the gcloud alloydb clusters describe
command to display details about the
cluster.
The continuousBackupConfig and continuousBackupInfo keys summarize the cluster's continuous backup and recovery configuration. This includes whether continuous backup is enabled, the size of its recovery window, and its encryption settings.
The continuousBackupInfo key also displays the continuous backup schedule: always one backup per day, every day.
The automatedBackupPolicy key, if present, summarizes the cluster's automated backup configuration. This includes whether automated backup is enabled, and displays the backup schedule and encryption settings.
For example, the following output of a gcloud alloydb clusters
describe command shows that the cluster has automated backup enabled,
with backups taken every Monday and Thursday at around 1 AM UTC. It also has continuous backup enabled, with a 10-day recovery window.
