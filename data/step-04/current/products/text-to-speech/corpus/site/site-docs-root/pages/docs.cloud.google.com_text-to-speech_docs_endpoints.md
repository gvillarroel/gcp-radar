Specify a regional endpoint
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud Text-to-Speech offers global , us , eu multiregional and regional API endpoints.
If you use a regional endpoint, your data at-rest and in-use stay
within the regional or continental boundaries of Europe or the USA, respectively. If your data's location must be controlled in order to comply with local regulatory requirements, then specifying an endpoint is important. There is no functional change to the behavior of
the API.

Use regional endpoints
When you use a regional endpoint, make sure to include the matching us or eu
location in the parent string. See the
Synthesize
documentation for more information about configuring the synthesize request
body.
Protocol
To perform text to speech synthesis using a regional endpoint, run the
applicable command in the table below to configure the correct endpoint:
Multi-region
Endpoint override
EU
$ export CLOUD_TTS_ENDPOINT=https://eu-texttospeech.googleapis.com
US
$ export CLOUD_TTS_ENDPOINT=https://us-texttospeech.googleapis.com
Only Neural2 voices are available from these endpoints:
Single-region
Endpoint override
US Central1
$ export CLOUD_TTS_ENDPOINT=https://us-central1-texttospeech.googleapis.com
The following code sample demonstrates how to send a
synthesis request
that keeps all data confined to a specified region. You can substitute either
the EU or US regional endpoint for the CLOUD_TTS_ENDPOINT
variable. Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
--data "{
'input':{
'text':'Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google,
based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for
touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.'
},
'voice':{
'languageCode':'en-gb',
'name':'en-GB-Neural2-A',
'ssmlGender':'FEMALE'
},
'audioConfig':{
'audioEncoding':'MP3'
}
}" $ CLOUD_TTS_ENDPOINT /v1/text:synthesize > synthesize-text.txt
This example uses the Google Cloud CLI to create an access
token for your Google Account. For instructions on installing the
gcloud CLI, see
Authenticate to Cloud TTS .
Restrict global API endpoint usage
To help enforce the use of regional endpoints, use the
constraints/gcp.restrictEndpointUsage organization policy constraint to block
requests to the global API endpoint. For more information, see
Restrict endpoint usage .
