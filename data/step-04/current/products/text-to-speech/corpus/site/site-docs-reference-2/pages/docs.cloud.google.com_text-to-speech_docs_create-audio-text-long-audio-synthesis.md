Create long-form audio
Preview
This product or feature is

of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.

launch stage descriptions .
This document walks you through the process of synthesizing long-form audio.
Long Audio Synthesis asynchronously synthesizes up to 1 million bytes on input.
To learn more about the fundamental concepts in Cloud Text-to-Speech, read
Cloud Text-to-Speech Basics .
Before you begin
Before you can send a request to the Cloud Text-to-Speech API, you must have completed
the following actions. See the
before you begin page for details.
Enable Cloud Text-to-Speech on a Google Cloud project.
Make sure billing is enabled for Cloud Text-to-Speech.
Make sure you have the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles on the output Google Cloud bucket.
Storage Object Creator
Storage Object Viewer
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Synthesize long audio from text using the command line
You can convert long-form text to audio by making an HTTP POST request to the
https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/{$project_number}/locations/global:synthesizeLongAudio endpoint.
In the body of your POST command, specify the following fields.
• voice : The type of voice to synthesize.
• input.text : The text to synthesize.
• audioConfig : The type of audio to create.
• output_gcs_uri : The Google Cloud output path under the form of "gs://bucket_name/file_name.wav".
• parent : The parent under the form "projects/{YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER}/locations/{YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION}".
The input can contain up to 1MB of characters, the exact limit can vary from different inputs.
Create a Google Cloud storage bucket under the project that is used to run the synthesis. Make sure the service account used to run the synthesis has read and write access to the output Google Cloud bucket.
Execute the REST request at the command line to synthesize the audio from the
text using Cloud TTS. The command uses the gcloud auth
application-default print-access-token command to retrieve an authorization
token for the request.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/12345/locations/global:synthesizeLongAudio
Request JSON body:
{
"parent": "projects/12345/locations/global",
"audio_config":{
"audio_encoding":"LINEAR16"
},
"input":{
"text":"hello"
},
"voice":{
"language_code":"en-us",
"name":"en-us-Standard-A"
},
"output_gcs_uri": "gs://bucket_name/file_name.wav"
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/12345/locations/global:synthesizeLongAudio"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/12345/locations/global:synthesizeLongAudio" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "23456",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.texttospeech.v1beta1.SynthesizeLongAudioMetadata",
"progressPercentage": 0,
"startTime": "2022-12-20T00:46:56.296191037Z",
"lastUpdateTime": "2022-12-20T00:46:56.296191037Z"
},
"done": false
}
The JSON output for the REST command contains the long operation name in the
name field. Execute the REST request at the command line to query
the state of the long-running operation.
Make sure that the service account running the GET operation is from the same project as the one used for synthesis.
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/12345/locations/global/operations/23456
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/12345/locations/global/operations/23456"
PowerShell (Windows)

the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/12345/locations/global/operations/23456" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/12345/locations/global/operations/23456",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.texttospeech.v1beta1.SynthesizeLongAudioMetadata",
"progressPercentage": 100
},
"done": true
}
Query the list of all operations running under a given project, execute the
REST request.
Make sure that the service account running the LIST operation is from the same project as the one used for synthesis.
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/12345/locations/global/operations
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:

the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/12345/locations/global/operations"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/12345/locations/global/operations" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"operations": [
{
"name": "12345",
"done": false
},
{
"name": "23456",
"done": false
}
],
"nextPageToken": ""
}
Once the long-running operation successfully completes, find the output
audio file in the given bucket uri in the output_gcs_uri field. If the
operation did not complete successfully, find the error by querying using
the GET REST command, correct the error, and issue the RPC again.
Synthesize long audio from text using client libraries
Follow these instructions for synthesizing long audio.
Install the client library
Python
Before installing the library, make sure you've prepared your environment for Python development .
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-texttospeech
Create audio data
You can use Cloud TTS to create a long audio file
of synthetic human speech. Use the following code to create a long audio file
in your Google Cloud bucket.
