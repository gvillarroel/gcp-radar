Quotas and limits
This document lists the quotas and system limits that apply to
Application Integration.
Quotas have default values, but you can typically request
adjustments.
System limits are fixed values that can't be changed.
Google Cloud uses quotas to help ensure fairness and reduce
spikes in resource use and availability. A quota restricts how much of a
Google Cloud resource your Google Cloud project can use. Quotas
apply to a range of resource types, including hardware, software, and network
components. For example, quotas can restrict the number of API calls to a
service, the number of load balancers used concurrently by your project, or the
number of projects that you can create. Quotas protect the community of
Google Cloud users by preventing the overloading of services. Quotas also
help you to manage your own Google Cloud resources.
The Cloud Quotas system does the following:
Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services
Restricts your consumption of those resources
Provides a way to
request changes to the quota value
and automate quota adjustments
In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota
allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that
you're trying to perform fails.
Quotas generally apply at the Google Cloud project
level. Your use of a resource in one project doesn't affect
your available quota in another project. Within a Google Cloud project, quotas
are shared across all applications and IP addresses.
For more information, see the
Cloud Quotas overview .
There are also system limits on Application Integration resources.
System limits can't be changed.
By default, Application Integration quotas and limits apply on a per-project basis. Quotas and limits that apply on a different
basis are indicated as such; for example, the default concurrent executions for each project, or the maximum numbers of integrations per project.
Resource quotas
The following quotas apply to Application Integration resources for each Google Cloud project. You can increase or decrease the quota by requesting for a quota change .

Usage limits
Application Integration enforces the following usage limits. Your are responsible for tracking and ensuring that the values stay within the prescribed limits. Exceeding the limits might lead to reduced throughput, task failures, and increased latencies when running the integration.
Resource
Limit
Value
Applicable to the entire Application Integration
Maximum characters in the integration name
64 characters
Maximum cumulative size of all the integration
data (including input and output variables)
Note: Similar to integrations, each sub-integration also has a limit of 30 MB. However, when a private trigger is triggered from an integration, the size of both the integration and the private trigger is counted towards the limit, since they are in the same execution.
30 MB
Caution: If the data size exceeds 10 MB , Application Integration runs the integration,
but disables local logging . As a result, you
can't view the full execution logs, apply retry strategy, or monitor integrations in the
monitoring dashboard .
Maximum cumulative size of all the
integration data (including input and output variables)
sent and received from connections
8 MB
Timeout for synchronous (SYNC) integration executions
The timeout duration includes any external system calls or
sub-integration tasks of the integration during its execution. After the timeout duration, the execution status is set to CANCELED .
Examples of external system
calls include, calling external endpoints,
calling Salesforce using connectors, and calling Google Cloud functions
2 minutes
Timeout for asynchronous (ASYNC) integration executions
If your sub-integration takes longer than 2 minutes to run, consider executing your
integration in ASYNC mode
10 minutes
Maximum time till which an older version of the integration
can run after publishing the new version (system consistency)
This is because Application Integration is a distributed system that
provides eventual consistency . It uses caches throughout
the system that may take time to clear and refresh
10 minutes
Maximum numbers of integrations per project
1000
Maximum number of tasks in an integration
If there is a need for more tasks, it is recommended that you split your integration
into multiple integrations
100
Maximum versions allowed for an integration
100
Number of days an integration execution can last, including the pause during the approval task
31 days
API trigger
Maximum characters for TRIGGER_NAME in Trigger ID
Trigger ID format: api_trigger/ TRIGGER_NAME
64 characters
Apps Script task
Maximum active deployments for an Apps Script
50
Queries per second (QPS) for API executables
5000 per minute
Queries per second (QPS) for Webapp deployments
5000 per minute
Latency for API executables
1.5 seconds
Latency for Webapp
2.5 seconds
Maximum cumulative size of all the integration variables in an Apps Script
15 MB
Call REST Endpoint task
Maximum number of concurrent REST calls
100
Maximum size of the request from the REST endpoint
25 MB
Maximum size of the response from the REST endpoint
25 MB
Call Integration task
Maximum number of sub-integrations that can run from the main integration
10000
Connectors task
Timeout for Connector task execution
3 minutes
Maximum size of the response from the connector
20 MB
Execute Custom Query: Maximum timeout
180 seconds
Execute Custom Query: Maximum number of rows
50,000
While Loop task and For Each Loop task
Maximum cumulative size of data processed
20 MB
Maximum number of iterations
8000
Maximum cumulative size of data collected from each sub-integration call
50 MB
For Each Parallel task
Maximum cumulative size of data processed
20 MB
Maximum number of iterations
10000
Maximum number of parallel executions
To increase this limit, you must request an increase for the Default concurrent executions per project quota.
50
Data Mapping task
Maximum size of an array data type variable
100000 elements
Maximum size of a JSON data type variable
20 MB
Maximum size of a string data type variable
20 MB
Data Transformer task
Maximum memory available for script evaluation
300 MB
JavaScript task
Maximum request size for the script
25 MB
Send Email task
Maximum recipient count for the task
30
Data processing limits
We don't recommend using integrations in the following scenarios:
Integration requires movement of bulk data or focus on extract, transform, and
load (ETL) processes
Cumulative size of all the integration data is greater than 10 MB during
execution
When calculating the cumulative data size, add the size of all types of data
such as input variables, output variables, and other intermediate task variables
Caution: If the data size exceeds 10 MB, Application Integration runs the integration,
but disables local logging . As a result, you
can't view the full execution logs, apply retry strategy, or monitor integrations in the
monitoring dashboard .
