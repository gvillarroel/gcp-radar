Audience
This tutorial is designed to help you start exploring
and developing applications with the Video Intelligence API. It's
designed for people with basic familiarity with Python. You should also be able
to follow along with limited programming knowledge. Having
walked through this tutorial, you should be able to use the
Reference documentation to create your own
basic applications.
This tutorial steps through a Video Intelligence API application using Python
code. The purpose here is not to explain the Python client libraries, but to
explain how to make calls to the Video Intelligence API using the video label detection
feature. Applications in Java and Node.js are essentially similar.
If you're looking for a code-only example or an example in another language,
check out the companion
how-to guide .
Prerequisites
This tutorial has the following prerequisites:
You've set up a Video Intelligence API project in the Google Cloud console.
You've set up your environment using a service account and
Application Default Credentials .
You have basic familiarity with Python programming.
You've set up your Python development environment. It's recommended that
you have the latest version of Python, pip , and virtualenv installed on
your system. For instructions, refer to the Python Development Environment Setup Guide
for Google Cloud.
You've installed the Google Cloud client library
Annotate a video using label detection
This tutorial walks you through a basic Video API application, using a
LABEL_DETECTION request. A LABEL_DETECTION request annotates a video with
labels (or "tags") that are selected based on the image content. For example, a
video of a train at a crossing may produce labels such as "train",
"transportation", "railroad crossing."
The following is the entire code needed for this tutorial. Most comments
have been removed from this code to highlight how brief the code is. Instead,
comments are provided later as we walk through the code.
import argparse
from google.cloud import videointelligence
def analyze_labels ( path ):
"""Detects labels given a GCS path."""
video_client = videointelligence . VideoIntelligenceServiceClient ()
features = [ videointelligence . Feature . LABEL_DETECTION ]
operation = video_client . annotate_video (
request = { "features" : features , "input_uri" : path }
)
print ( " \n Processing video for label annotations:" )
result = operation . result ( timeout = 90 )
print ( " \n Finished processing." )
segment_labels = result . annotation_results [ 0 ] . segment_label_annotations
for i , segment_label in enumerate ( segment_labels ):
print ( "Video label description: {} " . format ( segment_label . entity . description ))
for category_entity in segment_label . category_entities :
print (
" \t Label category description: {} " . format ( category_entity . description )
)
for i , segment in enumerate ( segment_label . segments ):
start_time = (
segment . segment . start_time_offset . seconds
+ segment . segment . start_time_offset . microseconds / 1e6
)
end_time = (
segment . segment . end_time_offset . seconds
+ segment . segment . end_time_offset . microseconds / 1e6
)
positions = " {} s to {} s" . format ( start_time , end_time )
confidence = segment . confidence
print ( " \t Segment {} : {} " . format ( i , positions ))
print ( " \t Confidence: {} " . format ( confidence ))
print ( " \n " )
if __name__ == "__main__" :
parser = argparse . ArgumentParser (
description = __doc__ , formatter_class = argparse . RawDescriptionHelpFormatter
)
parser . add_argument ( "path" , help = "GCS file path for label detection." )
args = parser . parse_args ()
analyze_labels ( args . path )
This simple application performs the following tasks:
Imports the libraries necessary to run the application.
Takes a video file stored in Cloud Storage URI as an argument and
passes it to the main() function.
Gets credentials to run the Video Intelligence API service.
Creates a video annotation request to send to the video service.
Sends the request and returns a long-running operation.
Loops over the long-running operation until the video is processed and
returns available values.
Parses the response for the service and displays the response to the user.
Import libraries
import argparse
from google.cloud import videointelligence
Some standard libraries are imported: argparse to allow the application to
accept input filenames as arguments and sys for formatting output while
waiting for API responses. The package time is imported to run
some simple wait loops.
When using the Video Intelligence API, you'll also need to import the
google.cloud.videointelligence_v1 and its enumeration class, which holds
the directory of our API calls.
Run the application
parser = argparse . ArgumentParser (
description = __doc__ , formatter_class = argparse . RawDescriptionHelpFormatter
)
parser . add_argument ( "path" , help = "GCS file path for label detection." )
args = parser . parse_args ()
analyze_labels ( args . path )
Here, the passed argument is parsed for the Cloud Storage URI of
the video filename and is passed to the main() function.
Authenticate to the API
Before communicating with the Video Intelligence API service, you need to
authenticate your service using previously acquired credentials. Within an
application, the simplest way to obtain credentials is to use
Application Default Credentials
(ADC). By default, ADC attempts to obtain credentials from the
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment file, which should be set to point
to your service account's JSON key file. (You should have set up your service
account and environment to use ADC in the Quickstart .
Construct the request
video_client = videointelligence . VideoIntelligenceServiceClient ()
features = [ videointelligence . Feature . LABEL_DETECTION ]
operation = video_client . annotate_video (
request = { "features" : features , "input_uri" : path }
)
Now that the Video Intelligence API service is ready, you can construct a request
to that service. Requests to the Video Intelligence API are
provided as JSON objects. See the
Video Intelligence API Reference for
complete information on the specific structure of such a request.
This code snippet performs the following tasks:
Constructs the JSON for a POST request to the annotate_video() method.
Injects the Cloud Storage location of the passed video filename into
the request.
Indicates that the annotate method should perform LABEL_DETECTION .
Check the operation
result = operation . result ( timeout = 90 )
print ( " \n Finished processing." )
Using the existing operation request for the existing operation, a while loop
is constructed to periodically check the state of that operation. Once the
operation has indicated that the operation is done , the response is parsed.
Parse the response
segment_labels = result . annotation_results [ 0 ] . segment_label_annotations
for i , segment_label in enumerate ( segment_labels ):
print ( "Video label description: {} " . format ( segment_label . entity . description ))
for category_entity in segment_label . category_entities :
print (
" \t Label category description: {} " . format ( category_entity . description )
)
for i , segment in enumerate ( segment_label . segments ):
start_time = (
segment . segment . start_time_offset . seconds
+ segment . segment . start_time_offset . microseconds / 1e6
)
end_time = (
segment . segment . end_time_offset . seconds
+ segment . segment . end_time_offset . microseconds / 1e6
)
positions = " {} s to {} s" . format ( start_time , end_time )
confidence = segment . confidence
print ( " \t Segment {} : {} " . format ( i , positions ))
print ( " \t Confidence: {} " . format ( confidence ))
print ( " \n " )
Once the operation has been completed, the response will contain the result
within an
AnnotateVideoResponse ,
which consists of a list of annotationResults , one for each video sent in
the request. Because only one video was sent in the request, the
first segmentLabelAnnotations of the results is taken, all the labels in
segmentLabelAnnotations are looped through. By using only
segmentLabelAnnotations , this tutorial displays only video-level annotations.
Each segment_label includes a description ( segment_label.description ), a
list of entity categories ( segment_label.category_entities ), and a list of
segments identifying the start/end time of the label occurrences in the video
(should be one segment spanning the whole video or video segment for the case of segment_label_annotations ).

Because only one video was sent in the request, the
first description of the first result is printed.
Run your application
To run your application, simply pass it the Cloud Storage URI of a video:
$ python labels.py gs:// YOUR_BUCKET / YOUR_OBJECT
