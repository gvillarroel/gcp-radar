JSON representation
Status
JSON representation
This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
JSON representation
{
"name" : string ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
} ,
"done" : boolean ,
// Union field result can be only one of the following:

// End of list of possible types for union field result .
}
Fields
name
string
The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should have the format of operations/some/unique/name .
metadata
object
Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
done
boolean
If the value is false , it means the operation is still in progress. If true , the operation is completed, and either error or response is available.
Union field result . The operation result, which can be either an error or a valid response . If done == false , neither error nor response is set. If done == true , exactly one of error or response is set. result can be only one of the following:
error
object( Status )
The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
response
object
The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete , the response is google.protobuf.Empty . If the original method is standard Get / Create / Update , the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse , where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot() , the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse .
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
Status
The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC . The error model is designed to be:
Simple to use and understand for most users
Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
Overview
The Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code , but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers understand and resolve the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package google.rpc that can be used for common error conditions.
Language mapping
The Status message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the Status message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
Other uses
The error model and the Status message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments.
Example uses of this error model include:
Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the Status in the normal response to indicate the partial errors.
Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a Status message for error reporting.
Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the Status message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response.
Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the Status message.
Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message Status could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

Fields
code
number
The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code .
message
string
A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
details[]
object
A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
