Integrate AWS WAF with Google SecOps
This document describes how to integrate AWS WAF with
Google Security Operations (Google SecOps).
Use cases
The AWS WAF integration helps you secure your web applications by allowing
you to:
Automate IP blocking : Automatically add malicious IP addresses detected by
Google SecOps to AWS WAF IP Sets to block traffic at the network
edge.
Manage access control lists (ACLs) : Dynamically create and update Web ACLs
to respond to emerging threats.
Orchestrate global and regional security : Manage rules for both regional
resources (like ALBs) and global resources (Amazon CloudFront) from a single
interface.
Integration parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the integration:
Parameter Display Name
Type
Default Value
Is Mandatory
Description
AWS Access Key ID
String
N/A
Yes
AWS Access Key ID to use in integration.
AWS Secret Key
Password
N/A
Yes
AWS Secret Key to use in integration.
AWS Default Region
String
N/A
Yes
AWS default region to use in integration, for example us-west-2.
The Regional scope in AWS WAF corresponds to the
region set here. The CloudFront
scope is global and does not rely on this region, but resources created
under Regional are scoped to this value.
To manage AWS WAF resources across multiple AWS regions, you must
configure a separate integration instance for each region.
For instructions about how to configure an integration in
Google SecOps, see Configure
integrations .
You can make changes at a later stage, if needed. After you configure an
integration instance, you can use it in playbooks. For more information about
how to configure and support multiple instances, see Supporting
multiple instances .
Actions
For more information about actions, see
Respond to pending actions from Your Workdesk and Perform a
manual action .
Ping
Test the connectivity to AWS WAF.
Important: This action verifies connectivity only to the Regional AWS WAF
service endpoint corresponding to the AWS Default Region
set in the integration parameters. Successful execution confirms that
the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Key are valid for that region. It does
not test connectivity to the global CloudFront scope.
To verify connectivity to the CloudFront scope, configure the
integration and run the List Web ACLs action with
Scope set to CloudFront .
Parameters
N/A
Run On
This action doesn't run on entities.
