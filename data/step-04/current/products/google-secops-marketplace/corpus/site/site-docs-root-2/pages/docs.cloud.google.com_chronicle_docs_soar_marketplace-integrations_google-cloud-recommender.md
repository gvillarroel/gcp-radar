Integrate Recommender with
Google SecOps
This document explains how to integrate Recommender with
Google Security Operations.
Before you begin
Before you configure the Recommender integration in the
Google SecOps platform, verify that you have the following:
Custom Identity and Access Management role : A role containing the
specific permissions required to view and update recommendations across projects
or organizations.
Authentication method : Choose between the
recommended Workload Identity (keyless) method or a service account JSON key.
API service roots : Access to the endpoints for the
Recommender API and Cloud Resource Manager API.
Custom IAM role permissions
Create a custom role in the Google Cloud console and assign it the permissions
required for the integration to function correctly.
In the Google Cloud console, go to
IAM & Admin > Roles page.
Go to Roles
Click Create role .
Enter a Title , Description , and a unique ID for the role.
Set the Role Launch Stage to General Availability .
Click Add permissions and add the following:
Recommender API :
recommender.iamPolicyInsights.get
recommender.iamPolicyInsights.list
recommender.iamPolicyRecommendations.get
recommender.iamPolicyRecommendations.list
recommender.iamPolicyRecommendations.update
Cloud Resource Manager API :
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy
resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy
Location access :
recommender.locations.get
recommender.locations.list
Additional resource access :
resourcemanager.folders.get
resourcemanager.folders.getIamPolicy
resourcemanager.folders.setIamPolicy
resourcemanager.organizations.get
resourcemanager.organizations.getIamPolicy
resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy
Click Create .
Authentication configuration
Google SecOps supports two authentication paths. Configure one of
the following methods:
Option 1: Workload Identity (recommended) : This is
the recommended method because it provides a superior security posture by
eliminating the need to manage and rotate long-lived JSON keys.
Option 2: Service account JSON key : Uses a
standard JSON key file for authentication. Use this method only if Workload
Identity is not available in your environment.
Authenticate using Workload Identity (recommended)
This method uses service account impersonation to allow the platform to securely
access your resources.
Create a target service account:
Before the integration can access your Google Cloud resources, you must create a
dedicated service account in your project and assign it the necessary
permissions.
In the Google Cloud console, go IAM & Admin > Service Accounts .
Click Create service account .
Provide a name and ID, then click Create and continue .
Under Grant this service account access to project , select the
Custom IAM role created in the previous section.
Click Done .
Copy the email address of the service account.
Identify your Google SecOps instance identity:
To enable secure impersonation, you must first identify the unique service
account identity used by your specific Google SecOps instance.
In Google SecOps, go to
Content Hub > Response Integrations .
Search for and select the Recommender integration.
Paste the target service account email into Workload Identity Email .
Click Save and then click Test . The test is expected to fail.
Click close_small to the
right of Test and search the error message for an email address beginning
with gke-init-python@ or soar-python@ . Copy this unique email.
Grant impersonation permissions:
The final step is to grant your instance identity the permission to act as your
target service account, allowing it to perform actions without requiring a
static key file.
Return to the IAM & Admin > Service Accounts in the
Google Cloud console.
Select the name of the target service account you created.
Navigate to the Permissions tab and click Grant access .
In the New principals field, paste the email address .
In the Select a role field, choose Service account token creator
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ).
Click Save . Note that it may take a few minutes for this permission to
propagate before the connection test succeeds.
Authenticate using a service account JSON key
Use this method only if Workload Identity isn't available in your environment.
Create a service account:
To use key-based authentication, you must first create a service account in your
Google Cloud project to act as the identity for the integration.
In the Google Cloud console, go to
IAM & Admin > Service Accounts .
Click Create service account .
Provide a name and ID, then click Create and continue .
Under Grant this service account access to project , select the
Custom IAM role you created.
Click Done .
Generate and save a JSON key:
After creating the service account, you must generate a private JSON key file
that contains the credentials required for Google SecOps to sign
in.
In IAM & Admin > Service Accounts , select the service
account you created.
Navigate to the Keys tab.
Click Add key > Create new key .
Select JSON as the key type and click Create . The JSON file downloads
to your computer.
Copy the entire content of this file and paste it into
User's Service Account during integration configuration.
Integration parameters
The Recommender integration requires the following parameters:
Parameter
Description
API Root
Required.
The API root of the Recommender service.
The default value is https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/ .
Resource Manager API Root
Required.
The API root for the Resource Manager service used to manage project
and organization resources.
The default value is
https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/ .
Organization ID
Optional.
The unique identifier of the Google Cloud organization to use with the
integration.
Project ID
Optional.
The Google Cloud project ID to use for retrieving recommendations.
Quota Project ID
Optional.
The project ID used for billing and quota purposes.
If no value is provided, the project associated with the service account
credentials is used.
Workload Identity Email
Optional.
The client email address of the service account used for Workload
Identity impersonation.
Important: Don't populate this field if you
intend to authenticate using a JSON key, as providing both
causes authentication conflicts.
To prevent "Permission Denied" errors, grant the Service Account
Token Creator role to the Google SecOps instance
service account on the email provided in this field.
User's Service Account
Optional.
The full content of the service account JSON key file.
Important: To authenticate, you must provide either this field or
the Workload Identity Email . Don't populate this field if you
intend to authenticate using a Workload Identity, as providing both
causes authentication conflicts.
Verify SSL
Optional.
If selected, the integration validates the SSL certificate when connecting to
the Recommender server.
Enabled by default.
For instructions about how to configure an integration in
Google SecOps, see Configure
integrations .
You can make changes at a later stage, if needed. After you configure an
integration instance, you can use it in playbooks. For more information about
how to configure and support multiple instances, see Supporting
multiple instances .
