Response integrations community contribution guidelines
Supported in:
Google secops
SOAR
This document outlines the guidelines for submitting Response
Integrations to Google SecOps through community
contributions. All submitted integrations undergo a vetting process by the
official Google SecOps team, with a focus on the highlighted
requirements within this document.
Response integration metadata
Name
The Name should correspond to the product name with which the
integration is going to be integrated and shouldn't contain any
special characters.
The Display Name should be written with whitespaces; for example,
Vertex AI and not VertexAI .
Integration Identifier
The Integration Identifier is a unique identifier of the
integration. After the integration is created, this value can't be changed.
The identifier should be the same value as Name , but with
whitespaces removed.
The identifier is available in most places across the platform.
Description
The Description should provide a high-level overview of the
product with which the integration is created and shouldn't
exceed 500 characters. It must contain the following information:
This integration is owned by the "{vendor name}". Support Contact: {email}.
Avoid putting URLs in the description.
Logos
Each integration should be provided with an SVG icon. This icon should
adapt to the themes inside the platform. Icons should only inherit the theme
from the platform.
You should validate the logo on the following pages:
Response > Integration Setup
Response > Playbooks > Playbook Designer
Cases > Alert > Alert Playbook View
The following is an example of an SVG logo, designed to match our style guide:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><svg id="Layer_1" data-name="Layer 1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 21 23"> <defs> <style> .cls-1 { stroke-width: 0px; } </style> </defs> <path class="cls-1" d="M15.51,4.79H5.49c-.4,0-.72.32-.72.72v5.75c0,2.3,1.71,4.15,3.69,5.38.54.34,1.1.62,1.66.86l.09.04c.06.02.12.05.18.06.03,0,.07,0,.1,0,.1,0,.19-.03.28-.07l.09-.04c.76-.33,2.22-1.03,3.46-2.24,1.24-1.22,1.89-2.6,1.89-4v-5.75c0-.4-.32-.72-.72-.72ZM14.32,11.26c0,.88-.44,1.77-1.32,2.63-.65.64-1.55,1.22-2.5,1.68-.95-.46-1.84-1.04-2.5-1.68-.88-.86-1.32-1.75-1.32-2.63v-4.55h7.64v4.55ZM20.28,0H.72c-.4,0-.72.32-.72.72v10.77c0,2.56,1.18,4.99,3.51,7.21,2.29,2.18,5.12,3.56,6.61,4.2l.09.04s.1.04.15.05c.04,0,.09.01.13.01.1,0,.19-.02.28-.06l.09-.04c.53-.23,1.23-.55,2.02-.97,1.42-.75,3.11-1.82,4.59-3.23,2.33-2.22,3.51-4.64,3.51-7.21V.72c0-.4-.32-.72-.72-.72ZM16.17,17.31c-1.9,1.81-4.24,3.04-5.67,3.69-1.43-.65-3.77-1.88-5.67-3.69-1.94-1.84-2.92-3.8-2.92-5.82V1.92h17.18v9.57c0,2.02-.98,3.98-2.92,5.82Z"/></svg>
Be sure to encode the SVG before adding it to the integration definition
file, as can be found in other integrations in the Content Hub.
Documentation link
As part of the integration, you can add a link that will point users to
the documentation. This documentation is expected to be hosted on your end.
Users can access the documentation link from the Parameters
section of the Configure Instance dialog.
Configuration parameters
All integrations should contain configuration parameters (API Root + Auth
parameters), unless the underlying API doesn't require any authentication
and the API Root can be hardcoded. For all integrations where authentication
is needed, there should be a Verify SSL parameter.
All parameters should have a description. The description should help
users configure the integration from within the platform. Avoid putting URLs
in the description of parameters.
Ping action
The Ping action is a special action that is used by the platform
to validate API connectivity. This action is mandatory even if your
integration doesn't have any other actions. Whenever the user presses the
Test button inside the integration configuration, it should show an
accurate status of the connectivity.
Release notes
The general structure for the release note should follow the following
format:
{integration item} - {update}
For example: Get Case Details -
Added ability to fetch information about affected IOCs
Depending on the situation, there are unique release notes for specific
scenarios:
If it's a new integration: New Integration Added - {integration name}
If a new action is added: New Action Added - {action name}
If a new connector is added: New Connector Added - {connector name}
If a new job is added: New Job Added - {job name}
If a predefined widget is added to an action: {action name} - Added Predefined Widget.
If a predefined widget is updated: {action name} - Updated Predefined Widget.
For changes that affect all integration items: Integration - {Update}
For changes that affect all actions: Integration's Actions - {Update}
For changes that affect all connectors: Integration's Connectors - {Update}
For changes that affect all jobs: Integration's Jobs - {Update}
If the release contained a regressive change, then in the release note
you need to specify REGRESSIVE! . For example,
Google Chronicle - Chronicle Alerts Connector - REGRESSIVE! Updated
mapping.
Release notes are available in the Integration Details side
drawer that's displayed when you click the Details button in the
integration.
Versioning
Each integration update should be followed by a +1 update to the
integration version. Versions should be represented as an integer. Minor
versions like 11.1.3 or 11.1 are not allowed.
Tags
Optionally, you can add tags to your integration. Avoid creating new
types of tags; use the ones that are already inside the platform. If you
don't see a tag that suits you, consult with the vetting team.
General notes
Test every integration content before submission.
Review all integration content for potential vulnerabilities and
vulnerable dependencies.
Always use the latest supported version of Python during development
(Python 3.11).
Actions
Name
The Name of the action should point to the activity that is being
performed; for example, Get Case Details , List Entity Events ,
or Execute Search .
If the action is designed to work primarily with entities, then it's
preferred to put Entity in the name; for example,
Enrich Entities .
Action names should be conveyed in 2-3 words.
Description
The Description of the action should highlight to the user what
will be the outcome of the action execution.
If the action works with entities, then you need to append information
about what type of entities are supported. For example:
Add a vote to entities in VirusTotal. Supported entities: File Hash, URL, Hostname, Domain, IP Address. Note: only MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 Hash types are supported.
If the action works in Async mode, then you need to provide the following
note in the description:
Note: Action is running as async, adjust script timeout value in Google SecOps IDE for action, as needed.
Try to limit the description to 500 characters.
Action parameters
Action configuration parameters should have an intuitive name.
Avoid using special characters and try to limit the action parameter name to
2-4 words.
The description for the parameter should explain to the user what
impact that parameter has on the action execution. If the parameter supports
a predetermined amount of supported values, then inside the description
provide the following section:
Possible Values: {value 1}, {value 2}
Action output (script result)
The script result should represent a simple outcome of the action. In
most cases, it should just point to a variable called
is_success , which can take values true or
false .
In general, if the action finished execution and performed an operation,
is_success should be true .
Action output (JSON result)
The JSON Result is the most important output of the action. All of the
data available in the JSON result will be accessible during playbook
execution. Verify that a valid JSON object is being pushed to the output.
JSON Results have a limit of 15 MB in size.
When building a JSON result, make sure that there are no keys that will
be unique during execution. For example, the following JSON object
represents a poor structure as it would be unusable inside playbooks:
{
"10.10.10.10": {
"is_malicious": "false"
}
}
Instead, format it like this:
[
{
"is_malicious": "false",
"ip": "10.10.10.10"
}
]
If you're using entities inside the action and return results Per
Entity, then the best practice is to structure the JSON Result like this:
[
{
"Entity": "10.10.10.10",
"EntityResult": {
"is_malicious": "false",
}
}
]
Always consider how the output of the action can be used inside
automation.
Make sure that there is a JSON Sample for your action.
The JSON sample is used by the platform inside the Expression Builder
during the playbook building process. An accurate JSON sample makes the
playbook building experience significantly better. Remove any PII
information from JSON samples.
Action outputs (entity enrichment)
If actions are executing on entities, then during the action execution
you can append additional metadata to them. The structure of that metadata
should follow this format: {integration identifier}_{key} . For
example: WebRisk_is_malicious .
You can find the added metadata in the entities details page.
Action outputs (output message)
The output message should explain to the user how the action
execution went in a more descriptive manner. It should point the user to the
outcome of the action execution.
If some entities were successfully enriched but others were not, then the
best practice is to provide status information for each provided entity in
the message.
If you believe that a critical error was encountered during the action
execution, then make sure there is a verbose message for this situation and
fail the action. When the action fails, the corresponding playbook will stop
execution until the error is resolved or skipped manually.
Some examples of output messages:
Successfully enriched the following entities using information from VirusTotal: {entity.identifier}
Action wasn't able to find any information for the following entities using VirusTotal: {entity.identifier}
None of the provided entities were found in VirusTotal.
Successfully executed query "{query}" in Google SecOps.
If the action should fail and stop execution of the playbook, then it's
recommended to have the output message in the following structure:
"Error executing action "{action name}". Reason: {error}'
Avoid putting the whole traceback for errors. Instead, try to point the
user to the actual problem in natural language.
Connectors
Name
The Name of the connector should point the user to the data that's
going to be ingested. In general, the structure of the name should be like
this:
{integration display name} - {data that is being ingested} Connector
For example: Crowdstrike - Pull Alerts Connector
Description
The Description of the connector should highlight to the user what
will be ingested by the connector; for example, Pull alerts from Crowdstrike .
Additionally, you need to provide information about dynamic list support;
for example, Dynamic List works with the display_name parameter.
The final description in this case would look like this:
Pull alerts from Crowdstrike. Dynamic List works with the display_name parameter.
Try to limit the description to 500 characters.
Connector Parameters
Connector configuration parameters should have an intuitive name.
Avoid using special characters and try to limit the action parameter name to
2-4 words.
The description for the parameter should explain to the user what
impact that parameter has on the connector execution.
If the parameter supports a predetermined amount of supported values,
then inside the description provide the following section:
Possible Values: {value 1}, {value 2} . should have the
following parameters:
Max Alerts To Fetch : dictates how many {object} should be
processed during 1 connector iteration.
Max {Hours/Days} Backwards : dictates the start time on the
first iteration of the connector. For example, if Max Hours Backwards
is set to 1, the connector will begin pulling data from one hour earlier.
Verify SSL : verifies the connectivity to API/instance.
Ontology Mapping
For each connector that is created, it's recommended to provide ontology
mapping to verify that mutual customers get the best experience.
Ontology Mapping is used to automatically create entities (IOCs and
Assets). Additionally, critical metadata of system fields like
Start Time and End Time is defined there.
Dynamic List
The Dynamic list is an optional feature that lets you build an
advanced filter for ingestion. You have the flexibility to build any custom
logic with it, while having a unique UX. The most common use case is to
define an allowlist or a blocklist for ingestion.
If you are building any custom logic for Dynamic List , make sure
that it's provided in the description of the connector. Also, it's
recommended to have a Use Dynamic List as a blocklist parameter to
have inverse logic supported as well.
Jobs
Name
The Name of the job should explain to the user what this job is
performing. In general, the structure of the name should be like this:
{integration display name} - {process} Job
For example: ServiceNow - Sync Incidents Job
Description
The Description of the job should highlight to the user what the
job is doing during the iterations; for example, This job will
synchronize Security Command Center based cases created by the Urgent Posture
Findings connector.
Try to limit the description to 500 characters.
Job Parameters
Job configuration parameters should have an intuitive name. Avoid
using special characters and try to limit the action parameter name to 2-4
words.
The description for the parameter should explain to the user what
impact that parameter has on the job execution.
If the parameter supports a predetermined amount of supported values,
then inside the description provide the following section:
Possible Values: {value 1}, {value 2} .
Beyond authentication parameters, all jobs should have the
following parameters:
Max {Hours/Days} Backwards : dictates the start time on the
first iteration of the job.
Verify SSL : verifies the connectivity to API/instance.
