Introduction to Colab Enterprise
Colab Enterprise is a collaborative, managed notebook environment
with the security and compliance capabilities of Google Cloud.
Get started
To get started using Colab Enterprise, try any of the following:
Quickstart : To create your first Colab Enterprise notebook and
learn how to run its code on a default runtime, see Quickstart: Create a
Colab Enterprise notebook .
Notebook gallery : The notebook gallery is a curated collection of
notebooks to help you get started using Colab Enterprise. See
the notebook gallery . These
notebooks use ready-to-use templates and examples to make it easier to
learn new techniques, to understand best practices, and to get projects
started quickly. Browse the notebooks by category, or use the search bar
to find a notebook that helps you get started.
Share and collaborate
Colab Enterprise lets you share notebooks (IPYNB files) and collaborate
with others. You can share a notebook with a single user, Google group,
or Google Workspace domain. You control this access
through Identity and Access Management (IAM).
Learn how to grant access to a notebook .
Managed compute
Colab Enterprise lets you work in notebooks without having to manage
infrastructure. Colab Enterprise provisions a runtime for you when you
need it. If you want to, you can configure runtimes for specific needs,
but Colab Enterprise starts them for you and shuts them down when
you no longer need them.
Configurable runtimes
Use the default runtime or configure your own by creating a runtime template.
When you create a runtime template, you can choose between any available
machine type, add accelerators, and specify your disk space.
By using runtimes that you configured, you can run code on the runtime
that meets your needs at the moment. For example,
you can test your code with a small dataset by using a runtime with a
smaller, cost-effective machine type. Then you can use a runtime with
more processing power when you need to run your code with more data.
To learn more, see Runtimes and runtime templates .
Integrated with Vertex AI and BigQuery
Colab Enterprise's integrations with Google Cloud services
make it easier to use notebooks that interact with those services.
Colab Enterprise is a part of Vertex AI.
Colab Enterprise's API methods are a subset of the Vertex AI API.
This can save you time when you're managing access to
Colab Enterprise resources or when you authenticate and authorize
your notebook code to use Vertex AI.
To learn more, see the API usage overview .
Colab Enterprise is embedded within the UI of its integrated services.
This lets you do work in Vertex AI and BigQuery,
and then continue your work in a notebook without leaving their areas
of the Google Cloud console. For example, you can create
a notebook directly from the BigQuery editor, populated with a
sample query to help you get started. To learn more, see
BigQuery's Introduction to
notebooks .
Write and edit code with Gemini assistance
You can use Gemini in Colab Enterprise, which is a product in
the Gemini for Google Cloud portfolio,
to help you write and generate code in a Colab Enterprise notebook.
Gemini in Colab Enterprise can also help you fix
errors in your code. To learn more, see Write code
with Gemini assistance .
Idle shutdown
To help manage costs, Colab Enterprise runtimes shut down when they're
inactive for a specific time period. You can change the amount of time
or turn this feature off.
For more information, see Idle shutdown .
Run code that interacts with Google Cloud services and APIs
By default Colab Enterprise notebooks use your user credentials to
authenticate and authorize code that interacts with other Google Cloud
services.
This means that the notebook's code has the same level of access to
Google Cloud that the user does. This makes it easier to
write and run code that interacts with Google Cloud services.
For more information, see
Run code that interacts with Google Cloud .
Schedule notebook runs
You can schedule a notebook to run immediately for one time, or on a
recurring schedule. Colab Enterprise stores the results in
Cloud Storage for you to review and share with others. For more
information, see Schedule a notebook run .
Use with customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
By default, Google Cloud automatically
encrypts data when it is at rest
using encryption keys managed by Google. If you have specific compliance
or regulatory requirements related to the keys that protect your data,
you can use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) with your
Colab Enterprise runtimes and notebooks. For more information,
see Use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) .
Access Transparency
Colab Enterprise supports Access Transparency. Access Transparency provides
you with logs that capture the actions Google
personnel take when accessing your content. You can enable Access Transparency
for a Google Cloud project, if the project resides in an organization. See
Enabling Access Transparency .
For more information about Access Transparency, see Overview of
Access Transparency .
Reserve VM resources
Use
Compute Engine reservations
to gain a high level of assurance that your Colab Enterprise runtimes
have enough virtual machine (VM) resources to run.
Reservations are a Compute Engine feature. They help make sure that
you have the resources available to create VMs with the same hardware
(memory and vCPUs) and optional resources (GPUs and Local SSD disks)
whenever you need them.
For more information, see Use reservations .
Colab Enterprise is different from Colab
Colab Enterprise is different from
Colaboratory , which is still available. Both
have specific advantages that can be helpful depending on your needs.
See the main differences in the following table:

Storage
Regional storage in Dataform
Google Drive storage, regionalized storage not supported
Access control

Limitations
Consider the following limitations of Colab Enterprise
when planning your project:
The file size of imported notebooks is limited to approximately
20 MB. Working with a notebook that is near the
size limit can impact performance.
