Apigee Edge documentation.
This document provides a set of best practices for developing API proxies with Apigee.
The topics that are covered here include design, coding, policy use,
monitoring, and debugging. The information has been gathered by the experience of developers
working with Apigee to implement successful API programs. This is a living document and will be
updated from time to time.
In addition to the guidelines here, you might also find Introduction to antipatterns useful.
Development standards
Comments and Documentation
Provide inline comments in the ProxyEndpoint and TargetEndpoint
configurations. Comments enhance readability for a Flow, especially where policy file names are
not sufficiently descriptive to express the underlying functionality of the Flow.
Make comments useful. Avoid obvious comments.
Use consistent indentation, spacing, vertical alignment, and so on.
Framework-style coding
Framework-style coding involves storing API proxy resources in your own version control system
for reuse across local development environments. For example, to reuse a policy, store it in
source control so that developers can sync to it and use it in their own proxy development
environments.
To enable DRY (don't repeat yourself), where possible, policy configurations and scripts
should implement specialized, reusable functions. For example, a dedicated policy to extract
query parameters from request messages could be called
ExtractVariables.ExtractRequestParameters .
Clean up unused policies and resources (JavaScript, Java, XSLT, ) from API proxies,
especially large resources that have the potential to slow down import and deploy
procedures.
Naming Conventions
The policy name attribute and the XML policy file name must be identical.
The Script and ServiceCallout policy policy name attribute and the name of the
resource file should be identical.
DisplayName should accurately describe the policy’s function to someone
who has never worked with that API proxy before.
Name policies according to their function. Apigee recommends that you establish
a consistent naming convention for your policies.
For example, use short prefixes followed by a sequence of descriptive words separated by
dashes. For example, AM-xxx for AssignMessage policy .
See also apigeelint
tool .
Use proper extensions for resource files, .js for JavaScript, .py
for python, and .jar for Java JAR files.
Variable names should be consistent. If you choose a style, such as camelCase or
under_score, use it throughout the API proxy.
Use variable prefixes, where possible, to organize variables based on their purpose, for
example, Consumer.username and Consumer.password .
API proxy development
Initial Design Considerations
Warning: Do not call the Apigee API from
inside API proxies. The API is used for administrative management purposes, not API
flow logic. Due to longer-lived cache entries on the Apigee API servers, you may not see
updated data immediately in your proxy flows, particularly if you are doing quick writes and
then reads. Coding workarounds for this behavior can impact your proxies' performance.
Use policies
in API proxies instead.
For guidance on RESTful API design, download the e-book
Web API Design: The Missing Link .
Leverage Apigee policies and functionality wherever possible to build API proxies.
Avoid coding all proxy logic in JavaScript, Java, or Python resources.
Construct Flows in an organized manner. Multiple Flows, each with a single condition, are
preferable to multiple conditional attachments to the same PreFlow and Postflow.
As a 'failsafe', create a default API proxy with a ProxyEndpoint BasePath of
/ . This can be used to redirect base API requests to a developer site, to return a
custom response, or perform another action more useful than returning the default
messaging.adaptors.http.flow.ApplicationNotFound .
For optimal performance, Apigee recommends using no more than 3,000 API proxy basepaths per Apigee environment
or environment group. Exceeding this recommendation can result in increased latency for all new and existing API proxy deployments.
Use TargetServer resources to decouple TargetEndpoint configurations from concrete URLs,
supporting promotion across environments.
See Load balancing
across backend servers .
If you have multiple RouteRules, create one as the 'default', that is, as a RouteRule with
no condition. Ensure that the default RouteRule is defined last in the list of conditional
Routes. RouteRules are evaluated top-down in ProxyEndpoint. See API proxy configuration reference .
API proxy bundle size: API proxy bundles cannot be larger than 15MB.
API versioning: For Apigee's thoughts and recommendations on API versioning,
see Versioning in the Web API Design: The Missing
Link e-book.
Enabling CORS
Before publishing your APIs, you'll need to add the CORS policy to the
request PreFlow of the ProxyEndpoint to support client-side cross-origin requests.
CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) is a standard mechanism that allows JavaScript
XMLHttpRequest (XHR) calls executed in a web page to interact with resources from non-origin
domains. CORS is a commonly implemented solution to the
same-origin policy that is
enforced by all browsers. For example, if you make an XHR call to the Twitter API from JavaScript
code executing in your browser, the call will fail. This is because the domain serving the page
to your browser is not the same as the domain serving the Twitter API. CORS provides a solution
to this problem by allowing servers to opt-in if they wish to provide cross-origin resource
sharing.
For information about enabling CORS on your API proxies before publishing the APIs, see
Adding CORS
support to an API proxy .
Note: Most browsers support CORS. You can find a comprehensive list of supported
browsers here . For an in-depth description of
CORS, see the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing W3C
Recommendation .
If you are using a cache
policy on your API proxy, you must ensure that the response of the CORS policy is not
cached.
Message payload size
The message payload size in request or response flows for Apigee is restricted
by default to 10MB. Users who require large payload processing can configure a higher limit using the
<Properties> element in the ProxyEndpoint or TargetEndpoint configurations of their API proxies.
For more information on using response.payload.parse.limit or the request.payload.parse.limit
properties to configure a maximum payload size up to 30MB for request or response flows, see the
API proxy configuration reference .
Note that exceeding the specified message size results in a protocol.http.TooBigBody error.
Consider the following recommended strategies for handling large message sizes in Apigee:
We highly recommend isolating API proxies that frequently handle large payloads in a dedicated environment
to avoid a potential "noisy neighbor" scenario. System CPU and memory resources are consumed in greater quantities
by proxies that manage large payloads, especially when used in conjunction with policies that interact with large
payloads.
We also recommend limiting the use of policies to interact with large payloads. Using policies to repeatedly parse
and copy request or response payloads can negatively impact system performance.
Organizations that handle large volumes of high payload requests are encouraged to provide additional
IP addresses to avoid port exhaustion due to horizontal scaling.
Consider streaming requests and responses. Note that when you stream, policies no longer have access to
the message content. See Streaming
requests and responses .
If your organization uses Pay-as-you-go billing , we recommend using configurable limits for large payloads only
for API proxies deployed in Comprehensive environment.
Fault Handling
Leverage FaultRules to handle all fault handling. (RaiseFault policies are used to stop
message Flow and send processing to the FaultRules Flow.)
Within the FaultRules Flow, use an AssignMessage policy to build the fault response,
not a
RaiseFault policy . Conditionally execute AssignMessage policies based on the fault type that
occurs.
Always includes a default 'catch-all' fault handler so that system-generated faults can be
mapped to customer-defined fault response formats.
If possible, always make fault responses match any standard formats available in your
company or project.
Use meaningful, human-readable error messages that suggest a solution to the error
condition.
See Handling faults .
Persistence
Key/Value Maps
Use key/value maps only for limited data sets. They are not designed to be a long-term data
store.
Consider performance when using key/value maps as this information is stored in the
Cassandra database.
See KeyValueMapOperations policy .
Response Caching
Do not populate the response cache if the response is not successful or if the request is
not a GET. Creates, updates, and deletes should not be cached.
<SkipCachePopulation>response.status.code != 200 or request.verb !=
"GET"</SkipCachePopulation>
Populate cache with a single consistent content type (for example, XML or JSON). After
retrieving a responseCache entry, then convert to the needed content type with JSONtoXML or
XMLToJSON. This will prevent storing double, triple, or more data.
Ensure that the cache key is sufficient to the caching requirement. In many cases, the
request.querystring can be used as the unique identifier.
Do not include the API key ( client_id ) in the cache key, unless explicitly
required. Most often, APIs secured only by a key will return the same data to all clients for a
given request. It is inefficient to store the same value for a number of entries based on the
API key.
Set appropriate cache expiration intervals to avoid dirty reads.
Whenever possible, try to have the response cache policy that populates the cache execute
at the ProxyEndpoint response PostFlow as late as possible. In other words, have it execute
after translation and mediation steps, including JavaScript-based mediation and conversion
between JSON and XML. By caching mediated data, you avoid the performance cost of executing the
mediation step each time you retrieve cached data.
Note that you might want to instead cache unmediated data if mediation results in a
different response from request to request.
The response cache policy to lookup the cache entry should occur in the ProxyEndpoint
request PreFlow. Avoid implementing too much logic, other than cache key generation, before
returning a cache entry. Otherwise, the benefits of caching are minimized.
In general, you should always keep the response cache lookup as close to the client request
as possible. Conversely, you should keep the response cache population as close to the client
response as possible.
When using multiple, different response cache policies in a proxy, follow these guidelines
to ensure discrete behavior for each:
Execute each policy based on mutually exclusive conditions. This will help ensure that
only one of multiple response cache policies executes.
Define different cache resources for each response cache policy. You specify the cache
resource in the policy's <CacheResource> element.
See ResponseCache policy .
Policy and custom code
Policy or custom code?
Use built-in policies first and foremost (when possible). Apigee policies are hardened,
optimized, and supported. For example, use the standard AssignMessage policy and
ExtractVariables policy
policies instead of JavaScript (when possible) to create payloads, extract information from
payloads (XPath, JSONPath), and so on.
JavaScript is preferred over Python and Java. However, if performance is the primary
requirement, Java should be used over JavaScript.
JavaScript
Use JavaScript if it's more intuitive than Apigee policies (for example,
when setting target.url for many different URI combinations).
Complex payload parsing such as iterating through a JSON object and Base64
encoding/decoding.
JavaScript policy has a time limit, so infinite loops are blocked.
Always use JavaScript Steps and put files in jsc resources folder.
JavaScript policy type pre-compiles the code at deployment time.
Java
Warning: For JavaCallout policies, reliance on Java libraries that are
included with Apigee is not supported. Those libraries are for Apigee
product functionality
only, and there's no guarantee that a library will be available from release to release.
Use Java if performance is the highest priority, or if the logic cannot be implemented in
JavaScript.
Include Java source files in source code tracking.
See JavaCallout policy for information on using Java in API proxies.
Python
Do not use Python unless absolutely required. Python scripts can introduce performance
bottlenecks for simple executions, as it is interpreted at runtime.
Script Callouts (Java, JavaScript, Python)
Use a global try/catch, or equivalent.
Throw meaningful exceptions and catch these properly for use in fault responses.
Throw and catch exceptions early. Do not use the global try/catch to handle all
exceptions.
Perform null and undefined checks, when necessary. An example of when to do this is when
retrieving optional flow variables.
Avoid making HTTP/S requests inside of a script callout. Instead, use the
ServiceCallout policy as the policy handles connections gracefully.
JavaScript
JavaScript on the API Platform supports XML via
E4X .
See JavaScript object model .
Java
Warning: For JavaCallout policies, reliance on Java libraries that are
included with Apigee is not supported. Those libraries are for Apigee product functionality
only, and there's no guarantee that a library will be available from release to release.
When accessing message payloads, try to use context.getMessage() vs.
context.getResponseMessage or context.getRequestMessage . This ensures
that the code can retrieve the payload, in both request and response flows.
Import libraries to the Apigee organization or environment and do not include these in
the JAR file. This reduces the bundle size and will let other JAR files access the same library
repository.
Import JAR files using the Apigee resources API rather than including them inside the API
proxy resources folder. This will reduce deployment times and allow the same JAR files to be
referenced by multiple API proxies. Another benefit is class loader isolation.
Do not use Java for resource handling (for example, creating and managing thread
pools).
Python
Throw meaningful exceptions and catch these properly for use in Apigee fault
responses
See PythonScript policy .
ServiceCallouts
There are many valid use cases for using proxy chaining, where you use a service callout in
one API proxy to call another API proxy. If you use proxy chaining, be sure to avoid infinite
loop recursive callouts back into the same API proxy.
If you're connecting between proxies that are in the same organization and environment, be
sure to see
Chaining API
proxies together for more on implementing a local connection that avoids unnecessary
network overhead.
Build a ServiceCallout request message using the AssignMessage policy, and populate the
request object in a message variable. (This includes setting the request payload, path, and
method.)
The URL that is configured within the policy requires the protocol specification, meaning
the protocol portion of the URL, https:// for example, cannot be specified by a
variable. Also, you must use separate variables for the domain portion of the URL and for the
rest of the URL. For example: https://example.com .
Store the response object for a ServiceCallout in a separate message variable. You can then
parse the message variable and keep the original message payload intact for use by other
policies.
See ServiceCallout policy .
Accessing entities
AccessEntity Policy
For better performance, look up apps by uuid instead of app name.
See AccessEntity policy .
Logging
Use a common syslog policy across bundles and within the same bundle. This will keep a
consistent logging format.
See MessageLogging policy .
Monitoring
Cloud customers are not required to check individual components of Apigee (Routers,
Message Processors, and so on). Apigee's Global Operations team is thoroughly monitoring all of
the components, along with API health checks, given health check requests by the customer.
Apigee Analytics
Analytics can provide non-critical API monitoring as error percentages are measured.
See Analytics
dashboards .
Debug
The trace tool in the Apigee UI is useful for debugging runtime API issues, during
development or production operation of an API.
See Using the Debug tool .
Security
Use IP address restriction policies to limit access to your test environment. Allow access
for the IP addresses of your development machines or environments and disallow all others.
See AccessControl policy .
Always apply content protection policies (JSON and or XML) to API proxies that are deployed
to production. See JSONThreatProtection policy .
See the following topics for more security best practices:
XMLThreatProtection policy
RegularExpressionProtection policy
SOAPMessageValidation policy
Custom Logic in API Proxies
A common requirement when building API Proxies is to include some logic for processing requests
and/or responses. While many requirements can be met from a predefined set of
steps/actions/policies like verifying a token or applying a quota or responding with a cached
object, one often may require access to programmability. For example, looking up a location
(endpoint) from a routing table based on a key found in a request and dynamically applying a
target endpoint or a custom/proprietary authentication method, etc.
Apigee provides a developer with multiple options to deal with such custom logic. This document
will explore those options and when to use which:
Policy
Policy use cases
JavaScript and PythonScript
When to use:
The JavaScript and PythonScript policies are equivalent in capability. A developer's
familiarity in a language is typically the motivation of picking one over the other.
The JavaScript and PythonScript policies are best suited for processing logic
inline that is not overly complex and does not require the use of third-party libraries.
These policies are not as performant as the JavaCallout policy.
When not to use:
Apigee's API gateway is not an application server (nor does it provide the full
JavaScript runtime like node.js ). If the callout always takes over a second
to process, the logic most likely does not belong in the gateway and should be part of
the underlying service instead.
Best Practice : Apigee recommends JavaScript over PythonScript, since JavaScript offers
better performance.
JavaCallout
When to use:
The performance of processing the logic inline is critical.
Existing Java libraries provide much of the logic.
When not to use:
Apigee's API gateway is not an application server and is not meant to load
frameworks like Spring, JEE, etc. If the callout typically takes over a second
to process, the logic can be considered as functional (business logic).
Consider externalizing as a service.
To protect the Apigee API gateway from abuse, there are restrictions placed on the
type of code that can be executed. For example, Java code that tries to access certain
crypto libraries or access the file system is blocked from execution.
Java applications, especially those that rely on third party libraries, can bring
in many (and large) JAR files. These can slow down the bootup time of the gateways.
ExternalCallout
When to use:
Ideally suited to externalize custom logic and allow the custom logic to access
(and if necessary modify) the message context.
External callouts implement gRPC and may have better performance than a
ServiceCallout.
When using Apigee or Apigee hybrid on Google Cloud consider using
Cloud Functions or Cloud Run to host such logic.
As an effective replacement for the Hosted Targets feature in Apigee Edge.
When not use:
For lightweight logic that can execute quickly, inline.
ServiceCallout
When to use:
Complex logic is best implemented outside the gateway. This logic can have its own
life cycle (releases and versioning) and does not affect the functioning of the
gateway.
When the REST/SOAP/GraphQL endpoint already exists or can be easily implemented
When using Apigee or Apigee hybrid on Google Cloud, consider using Cloud Functions
or Cloud Run to host such logic.
As an effective replacement for the Hosted Targets feature in Apigee Edge.
When not use:
For lightweight logic that can execute quickly, inline
The API proxy must transfer context (like variables) or receive context from the
external implementation
To summarize:
If the logic is simple or trivial, use JavaScript (preferably) or PythonScript.
If inline logic requires better performance than JavaScript or PythonScript, use JavaCallout.
If the logic must be externalized, then use ExternalCallout.
If you already have external implementations and/or developers are familiar with REST, use
ServiceCallout.
