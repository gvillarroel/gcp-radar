Note: In environments enabled for archive deployments , you cannot manage target servers using the Apigee UI, API, or gcloud. To manage target servers for archive deployments using Apigee in VS Code,
see Configuring the target servers (targetservers.json) .
Apigee enhances the availability of your APIs by providing built-in support for load
balancing and failover across multiple backend server instances.
Target servers decouple concrete endpoint URLs from target endpoint
configurations. Instead of defining a concrete URL in the configuration, you can configure one
or more named target servers. Then, each target server is referenced by name in a target endpoint
HTTPConnection.

Description
Load balancing
using target servers
Load balancing APIs across target servers.
API routing based
on environment using target servers
Route an API to a different target server based on the environment.
About the target server configuration
A target server configuration consists of a name, a host, a protocol, and a port, with an
additional element to
indicate whether the target server is enabled or disabled. A target server can also have an optional
<sSLInfo>
object .
The following code provides an example of a target server configuration:
{
"name": "target1",
"host": "1.mybackendservice.com",
"protocol": "http",
"port": "80",
"isEnabled": "true"
}
For more information on the TargetServers API, see
organizations.environments.targetservers .
See the schema for TargetServer and other entities on
GitHub .
Creating target servers
Create target servers using the Apigee UI or API as described in the following sections.
Apigee UI
To create target servers using the Apigee UI:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Management > Environments page.
Go to Environments
Select the environment in which you want to define a new target server.
Click Target Servers at the top of the pane.
Click + Create Target Server .
Enter a name, host, protocol and port in the fields provided. The options for Protocol
are: HTTP for REST-based target servers, gRPC - Target for gRPC-based target
servers, or gRPC - External callout . See
Creating gRPC API proxies
for information on gRPC proxy support.
Optionally, you can select Enable SSL . See
SSL
certificates overview .
Click Create .
Apigee API
The following sections provide examples of using the Apigee API to create and list target servers.
Creating a target server in an environment using the API
Listing the target servers in an environment using the API
For
more information, see the TargetServers API .
Creating a target server in an environment using the API
To create a target server named target1 that connects to 1.mybackendservice.com on port 80 , use the following API call:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG /environments/ $ENV /targetservers" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d '
{
"name": "target1",
"host": "1.mybackendservice.com",
"protocol": "http",
"port": "80",
"isEnabled": "true",
}'
Where $TOKEN is set to your OAuth 2.0 access token, as described in
Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token . For information about the curl options used in this example, see
Using curl . For a description of environment variables you can use, see
Setting
environment variables for Apigee API requests .
The following provides an example of the response:
{
"host" : "1.mybackendservice.com",
"protocol": "http",
"isEnabled" : true,
"name" : "target1",
"port" : 80
}
Create a second target server using the following API call.
By defining two target servers, you provide two URLs that a target endpoint can use for load balancing:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG /environments/ $ENV /targetservers" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d '
{
"name": "target2",
"host": "2.mybackendservice.com",
"protocol": "http",
"port": "80",
"isEnabled": "true",
}'
The following provides an example of the response:
{
"host" : "2.mybackendservice.com",
"protocol": "http",
"isEnabled" : true,
"name" : "target2",
"port" : 80
}
Listing the target servers in an environment using the API
To list the target servers in an environment, use the following API call:
curl https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG /environments/ $ENV /targetservers \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
The following provides an example of the response:
[ "target2", "target1" ]
There are now two target servers available for use by API proxies deployed in the test
environment. To load balance traffic across these target servers, you configure the HTTP
connection in an API proxy's target endpoint to use the target servers.
Note: There is a limit of 1,000 target servers per environment, as
documented in the Limits topic.
Configuring a
target endpoint to load balance across named target servers
Now that you have two target servers available, you can modify the target endpoint's' <HTTPTargetConnection>
element to reference those two target servers by name:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<LoadBalancer>
<Server name="target1" />
<Server name="target2" />
</LoadBalancer>
<Path>/test</Path>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
Note: You can also call target servers and use load balancing in a
ServiceCallout policy. For details, see the ServiceCallout
policy .
The configuration above is the most basic load balancing configuration. The load
balancer supports three load balancing algorithms, RoundRobin , Weighted , and
LeastConnections .
Round Robin is the default algorithm. Since no algorithm is specified in the configuration above,
outbound requests from the API proxy to the backend servers will alternate, one for one, between
target1 and target2 .
The <Path> element forms the basepath of the target endpoint URI for
all target servers. It is only used when <LoadBalancer> is used. Otherwise, it
is ignored. In the above example, a request reaching to target1 will be
http://target1/test and so for other target servers.
Retries are triggered by I/O exceptions and HTTP time outs. Retries are not triggered by
HTTP error codes ( 4xx , 5xx ).
For more information, see
TargetEndpoint .
Configuring load balancer options
You can tune availability by configuring the options for load balancing and failover at the load
balancer and target server level as described in the following sections.
Algorithm
Sets the algorithm used by <LoadBalancer> . The available
algorithms are RoundRobin , Weighted , and LeastConnections ,
each of which is documented below.
Round robin
The default algorithm, round robin, forwards a request to each target server in the order in
which the servers are listed in the target endpoint HTTP connection. For example:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<LoadBalancer>
<Algorithm>RoundRobin</Algorithm>
<Server name="target1" />
<Server name="target2" />
</LoadBalancer>
<Path>/test</Path>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
Weighted
The weighted load balancing algorithm enables you to configure proportional traffic loads for
your target servers. The weighted LoadBalancer distributes requests to your target servers in direct
proportion to each target server's weight. Therefore, the weighted algorithm requires you to set
a weight attribute for each target server. For example:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<LoadBalancer>
<Algorithm>Weighted</Algorithm>
<Server name="target1">
<Weight>1</Weight>
</Server>
<Server name="target2">
<Weight>2</Weight>
</Server>
</LoadBalancer>
<Path>/test</Path>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
In this example, two requests will be routed to target2 for every one request routed to
target1 .
Least Connections
LoadBalancers configured to use the least connection algorithm route outbound requests to the
target server with fewest open HTTP connections. For example:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<LoadBalancer>
<Algorithm>LeastConnections</Algorithm>
<Server name="target1" />
<Server name="target2" />
</LoadBalancer>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
<Path>/test</Path>
</TargetEndpoint>
Maximum failures
The maximum number of failed requests from the API proxy to the target server that results in
the request being redirected to another target server.
A response failure means Apigee doesn't receive any response from a target server. When
this happens, the failure counter increments by one.
However, when Apigee does receive a response from a target,
even if the response is an HTTP error (such as 404 or 500 ),
that counts as a response from the
target server, and the failure counter is reset. To ensure that bad HTTP responses
(such as 500 ) also increment the failure counter to take an unhealthy server out of load
balancing rotation as soon as possible, you can add the
<ServerUnhealthyResponse> element with <ResponseCode>
child elements to your load balancer configuration. Apigee will also count responses with those
codes as failures.
In the following example, target1 will be removed from rotation after five failed requests,
including 404 and some 5XX responses from the target server.
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<LoadBalancer>
<Algorithm>RoundRobin</Algorithm>
<Server name="target1" />
<Server name="target2" />
<MaxFailures>5</MaxFailures>
<ServerUnhealthyResponse>
<ResponseCode>404</ResponseCode>
<ResponseCode>500</ResponseCode>
<ResponseCode>502</ResponseCode>
<ResponseCode>503</ResponseCode>
</ServerUnhealthyResponse>
</LoadBalancer>
<Path>/test</Path>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
The MaxFailures default is 0. This means that Apigee always tries to
connect to the target for each request and never removes the target server from the rotation.
It is best to use MaxFailures > 0 with a health monitor.
If you configure MaxFailures > 0, the target server is removed from rotation
when the target fails the number of times you indicate.
When a
health monitor is in place, Apigee automatically puts the
target server back in rotation after the target is up and running again, according to the
configuration of that health monitor. See Health monitoring
for more information.
Note that both regular API calls and calls initiated by a health monitor will count toward
the MaxFailures count.
Also note that the running failure count for each target server is maintained on a
per-load-balancer basis.
For example, suppose a proxy has two target endpoints, and each has a load balancer,
and both load balancers are configured to utilize the same set of target servers.
In such a case, the failures from one target endpoint only count against the
corresponding load balancer.
They do not affect the rotation of the other target endpoint.
Alternatively, if you configure MaxFailures > 0 and you do not configure a
health monitor, Apigee will automatically take the target server out of rotation when the
first failure is detected. Apigee will check the health of the target server every five minutes and return it to
the rotation when it responds normally.
Note: When Apigee executes a failover to an alternate target server in response to a backend error, the individual server failures that initiated the failover are not explicitly displayed within Trace sessions. Trace sessions are designed to provide a streamlined view of the complete request flow to an operational target, thereby minimizing diagnostic noise.
For comprehensive observation and tracking of failover events, consult your Google Cloud logs.
Retry
If retry is enabled, a request will be retried whenever a response failure (I/O error or HTTP timeout)
occurs or the response received matches a value set by <ServerUnhealthyResponse> .
See Maximum failures above for more on setting
<ServerUnhealthyResponse> .
By default <RetryEnabled> is set to true . Set to false to disable retry.
For example:
<RetryEnabled>false</RetryEnabled>
Note: There must be a minimum of two target servers defined
in the target endpoint configuration for retry to work.
IsFallback
One (and only one) target server can be set as the fallback server. The load balancer
will not use the fallback server until such time as
all the other target servers have been removed
from rotation by the load balancer.
When this happens, all traffic is routed to the fallback server until such time as one of the
other target servers reports as healthy again and is returned to rotation.
For example:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<LoadBalancer>
<Algorithm>RoundRobin</Algorithm>
<Server name="target1" />
<Server name="target2" />
<Server name="target3">
<IsFallback>true</IsFallback>
</Server>
</LoadBalancer>
<Path>/test</Path>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
The configuration above results in round robin load balancing between target1
and target2 until both target1 and target2 are
unavailable. When target1 and target2 are unavailable, all traffic
is routed to target3 .
If the fallback server is unhealthy, Apigee will not route traffic to it.
Instead, API calls will return a 503 "Service is temporarily unavailable"
error.
Path
Path defines a URI fragment that will be appended to all requests issued by the target server
to the backend server.
This element accepts a literal string path or a message template . A message
template lets you perform variable string substitution at runtime.
For example, in the following target endpoint definition, the value of {mypath} is used for the path:
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<SSLInfo>
<Enabled>true</Enabled>
</SSLInfo>
<LoadBalancer>
<Server name="testserver"/>
</LoadBalancer>
<Path>{mypath}</Path>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
Configuring a target server for TLS/SSL
If you are using a target server to define the backend service, and the backend service
requires the connection to use the HTTPS protocol, then you must enable TLS/SSL in the
target server definition. This is necessary because the host tag does not let you
specify the connection protocol.
Note: If you define the sSLInfo block in both the
target endpoint and the target server definition, the one in the target server takes precedence.
Configure one-way TLS/SSL
Use the following configuration to define a target server with one-way
TLS/SSL. In this example, Apigee makes HTTPS requests to the backend service:
{
"name": "target1",
"host": "mocktarget.apigee.net",
"protocol": "http",
"port": "443",
"isEnabled": "true",
"sSLInfo": {
"enabled": "true"
}
}
Configure strict SSL enforcement
To specify strict SSL enforcement in the target server definition, set enforce to true
in the sSLInfo block, as shown in the following example:
{
"name": "target1",
"host": "mocktarget.apigee.net",
"protocol": "http",
"port": "443",
"isEnabled": "true",
"sSLInfo": {
"enabled": "true",
"enforce": "true"
}
}
Configure two-way TLS/SSL
If the backend service requires two-way, or mutual, TLS/SSL, then you can configure
the target server with the same TLS/SSL configuration settings as target endpoints:
{
"name": "TargetServer 1",
"host": "www.example.com",
"protocol": "http",
"port": "443",
"isEnabled": "true",
"sSLInfo": {
"enabled": "true",
"clientAuthEnabled": "true",
"keyStore": "keystore-name",
"keyAlias": "keystore-alias",
"trustStore": "truststore-name",
"ignoreValidationErrors": "false",
"ciphers": []
}
}
Configure strict SSL using the API
To create a target server with strict SSL enforcement using an API call:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG /environments/ $ENV /targetservers" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d '
{
"name": "TargetServer 1",
"host": "www.example.com",
"protocol": "http",
"port": 443,
"isEnabled": true,
"sSLInfo":
{
"enabled":true,
"enforce":true,
"clientAuthEnabled":true,
"keyStore":"keystore-name",
"keyAlias":"keystore-alias",
"ciphers":[],
"protocols":[],
"clientAuthEnabled":true,
"ignoreValidationErrors":false,
"trustStore":"truststore-name"
}
}'
Health monitoring
Health monitoring enables you to enhance load balancing configurations by actively polling the
backend service URLs defined in the target server configurations. With health monitoring enabled, target servers that
are unreachable or return an error response are marked unhealthy. A failed target server is automatically
put back into rotation when the health monitor determines that the target server is active. No proxy
re-deployments are required.
Health monitoring works with <MaxFailures> . Without health monitoring enabled,
<MaxFailures> specifies the number of failed requests from the API proxy to the
target server that results in the request being redirected to another target server.
The failing target server is then taken out of rotation until you redeploy the proxy.
-->
You must set <MaxFailures> greater than 0 when using a health monitor.
If the <MaxFailures> value is set to 0, Apigee will always try to connect to the target
for each request and will not remove the target server from the rotation.
A health monitor acts as a simple client that invokes a backend service over TCP or HTTP:
A TCP client simply ensures that a socket can be opened.
You configure the HTTP client to submit a valid HTTP request to the backend service. You
can define HTTP GET , PUT , POST , or DELETE
operations. The response of the HTTP monitor call must match the
configured settings in the <SuccessResponse> block.
Successes and failures
When you enable health monitoring, Apigee begins sending health checks to your target
server. A health check is a request sent to the target server that determines whether or not the
target server is healthy.
A health check can have one of two possible results:
Success: The target server is considered healthy when a successful health
check occurs. This is typically the result of one or more of the following:
The target server accepts a new connection to the specified port, responds to a request on that port, and then closes the port within the specified timeframe. The response from the target server contains Connection: close
The target server responds to a health check request with a 200 (OK) or other HTTP status code that you determine is acceptable.
The target server responds to a health check request with a message body that matches the expected message body.
When Apigee determines that a server is healthy, Apigee continues or resumes sending requests to it.
Failure: The target server can fail a health check in different ways,
depending on the type of check. A failure can be detected when the target server:
Refuses a connection from Apigee to the health check port.
Does not respond to a health check request within a specified period of time.
Returns an unexpected HTTP status code.
Responds with a message body that does not match the expected message body.
When a target server fails a health check, Apigee increments that server's failure count. If
the number of failures for that server meets or exceeds a predefined threshold
( <MaxFailures> ), Apigee stops sending requests to that server.
Enabling a health monitor
To create a health monitor for an API proxy, add the <HealthMonitor> element to the target endpoint's <HTTPTargetConnection element
configuration for the proxy.
Health monitors cannot be created in the UI. Instead, you create a proxy configuration and
upload it as a ZIP file to Apigee. A proxy configuration is a structured description of all aspects
of an API proxy. Proxy configurations consist of XML files in a pre-defined directory structure. For more
information, see API Proxy
Configuration Reference .
Note: Health monitors must be configured on a per-proxy basis. If you
have multiple proxies that call the same target server, you must configure a Health Monitor for
each proxy.
<HealthMonitor> configuration elements
The following table describes the <HealthMonitor> configuration elements:
Name
Description
Default
Required?
IsEnabled
A boolean that enables or disables the health monitor.
false
No
IntervalInSec
The time interval, in seconds, between each polling TCP or HTTP request.
0
Yes
HTTPMonitor or TCPMonitor
A definition of the TCP or HTTP client to be used to poll the target server.
N/A
Yes
In addition to these elements, enabling a health monitor requires that you set the
<MaxFailures> element in the <HTTPTargetConnection> block
of the <TargetEndpoint> element to a value greater than 0.
<MaxFailures> is used to specify the maximum number of failed requests from the API proxy
to the target server that can occur before the request is redirected to another target server.
By default <MaxFailures> is 0, which means
Apigee performs no corrective action. When configuring a health monitor, ensure that you set
<MaxFailures>
to a non-zero value.
Health monitor using TCP monitor
The sample health monitor described in the following configuration uses a TCP monitor to poll each target server by opening a
connection on port 80 every five seconds. (Port is optional. If not specified, the TCP monitor port
is the target server port.)
In this sample health monitor configuration:
If the connection fails or takes more than 10 seconds to connect, then the failure count
increments by 1 for that target server.
If the connection succeeds, then the failure count for the target server is reset to 0.
You can add a health monitor as a child element of the target endpoint's <HTTPTargetConnection>
element, as shown below:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<LoadBalancer>
<Algorithm>RoundRobin</Algorithm>
<Server name="target1" />
<Server name="target2" />
<MaxFailures>5</MaxFailures>
</LoadBalancer>
<Path>/test</Path>
<HealthMonitor>
<IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled>
<IntervalInSec>5</IntervalInSec>
<TCPMonitor>
<ConnectTimeoutInSec>10</ConnectTimeoutInSec>
<Port>80</Port>
</TCPMonitor>
</HealthMonitor>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
<TCPMonitor> configuration elements
The following table describes the <TCPMonitor> configuration elements:
Name
Description
Default
Required?
ConnectTimeoutInSec
Time in which connection to the TCP port must be established to be considered a
success. Failure to connect in the specified interval counts as a failure, incrementing the
load balancer's failure count for the target server.
0
Yes
Port
Optional. The port on which the TCP connection will be established. If not specified,
the TCP monitor port is the target server port.
0
No
Health monitor using HTTP monitor
The sample health monitor described in the following configuration uses an HTTP monitor that
submits a GET request to the backend
service once every five seconds and adds an HTTP Basic Authorization header to the
request message.
In this sample health monitor configuration:
The expected response from the backend service is an HTTP response code 200 .
The expected value for the custom HTTP Basic Authorization header ImOK is YourOK .
The <UseTargetServerSSLInfo> element is set to true
to use the SSL parameters from the target server's <SSLInfo> block.
With this configuration, the expected response codes and header values will be compared against actual
responses from the backend service. If the response does not match, then the request will treated as a failure
by the load balancer configuration.
Note : All of the Request and Response settings in an HTTP monitor are specific to the
backend service that is invoked.
By default, health monitors cannot access keystores, truststores, or other SSL parameters from their target servers.
To enable access to these parameters for your health monitor in order to support mutual TLS, for example,
add <UseTargetServerSSLInfo>true</UseTargetServerSSLInfo> in the <Request> block.
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<LoadBalancer>
<Algorithm>RoundRobin</Algorithm>
<Server name="target1" />
<Server name="target2" />
<MaxFailures>5</MaxFailures>
</LoadBalancer>

<Header name="ImOK">YourOK</Header>
</SuccessResponse>
</HTTPMonitor>
</HealthMonitor>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
<HTTPMonitor> configuration elements
The following table describes the top-level <HTTPMonitor> configuration elements:
Name
Description
Default
Required?
Request
The outbound request message sent by the health monitor to the target servers in the rotation.
N/A
Yes
SuccessResponse
(Optional) Matching options for the inbound HTTP response message generated by the polled backend service.
N/A
No
<HTTPMonitor>/<Request> configuration elements
Configuration options for the outbound request message sent by the health monitor to
the target servers in the rotation. Note that <Request> is a required element.
Name
Description
Default
Required?
ConnectTimeoutInSec
Time, in seconds, in which the TCP connection handshake to the HTTP service must
complete to be considered a success. Failure to connect in the specified interval counts as
a failure, incrementing the LoadBalancer's failure count for the target server.
Note : If the specified value is 0, Apigee will use a default timeout of 30 seconds.
0
No
SocketReadTimeoutInSec
Time, in seconds, in which data must be read from the HTTP service to be considered a
success. Failure to read in the specified interval counts as a failure, incrementing the
LoadBalancer's failure count for the target server.
Note : If the specified value is 0, Apigee will use a default timeout of 30 seconds.
0
No
Port
The port on which the HTTP connection to the backend service will be established.
Target server port
No
Verb
The HTTP verb used for each polling HTTP request to the backend service.
N/A
No
Path
The path appended to the URL defined in the target server. Use the Path element to
configure a 'polling endpoint' on your HTTP service. Note that the Path element does not support variables.
N/A
No
UseTargetServerSSLInfo
When UseTargetServerSSLInfo is true, health monitor requests to a target server will
use the SSL parameters from the target server's SSLInfo ("sSLInfo") block. Otherwise,
SSL parameters such as the protocol, keystore, truststore, and so on will not be available to
the health monitor.
false
No
IncludeHealthCheckIdHeader Allows you
to track the healthcheck requests on upstream systems. The
IncludeHealthCheckIdHeader takes a Boolean value, and
defaults to false . If you set it to true , then
there is a Header named X-Apigee-Healthcheck-Id
which gets
injected into the healthcheck request. The value of the header is
dynamically assigned, and takes the form
ORG/ENV/SERVER_UUID/N , where ORG is the
organization name, ENV is the environment name,
SERVER_UUID is a unique ID identifying the MP, and
N is the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970.
Example resulting request header:
X-Apigee-Healthcheck-Id: orgname/envname/E8C4D2EE-3A69-428A-8616-030ABDE864E0/1586802968123
false
No
Payload
The HTTP body generated for each polling HTTP request. Note that this element is not
required for GET requests.
N/A
No
Header
One or more HTTP headers and values expected to be received from the polled
backend service. Any HTTP headers or values on the response that are different from those
specified result in a failure, and the count for the polled target server is incremented by
1. You can define multiple Header elements.
N/A
No
IsSSL
When true, specifies that the health monitor request be sent using HTTPS.
False
No
TrustAllSSL
Specifies whether the HTTP monitor check will automatically trust all SSL certificates.
False
No
<HTTPMonitor>/<SuccessResponse> configuration elements
(Optional) Matching options for the inbound HTTP response message generated by the polled backend
service. Responses that do not match increment the failure count by 1.
Name
Description
Default
Required?
ResponseCode
The HTTP response code expected to be received from the polled target server. A code
different than the code specified results in a failure, and the count being incremented for
the polled backend service. You can define multiple ResponseCode elements.
