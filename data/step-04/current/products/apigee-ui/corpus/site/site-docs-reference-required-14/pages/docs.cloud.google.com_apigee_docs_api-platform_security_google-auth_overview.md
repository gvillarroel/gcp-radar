View
Apigee Edge documentation.
This topic explains how to set up and deploy an API proxy that is configured to use
Google authentication.
Apigee hybrid users: If you are using Apigee hybrid, note that
this feature is only supported for Apigee hybrid v1.6.x and later versions.
Introduction
Apigee supports using Google
OAuth tokens or
OpenID
Connect tokens to authenticate with Google services such as
Cloud Logging and
Secret Manager , and custom services running
on certain Google Cloud products such as Cloud Functions and
Cloud Run .
To use this feature, you must configure the <Authentication> XML element in
one of the following contexts:
AssignMessage policies
ServiceCallout policies
ExternalCallout policies
TargetEndpoint configurations
After you complete some basic setup steps (as described in this topic), Apigee performs the token generation and makes secure
calls to targeted Google services or custom hosted services for you, without the need to manually set authentication headers or
otherwise modify a service request. From the perspective of an API developer, the process of
calling Google services from within a properly configured API proxy is handled seamlessly.
API proxy configuration options
This section explains where you can use the <Authentication> XML element to
enable Google OAuth Token or OpenID Connect authentication:
Configuration option
Description
AssignMessage policy
The
AssignMessage policy allows you to add the headers required for Google authentication and token injection.
For usage details and examples, see
AssignMessage policy .
ServiceCallout policy
The
ServiceCallout policy lets you call other internal or external services
from an API proxy. For example, ServiceCallout can call external Google services or
custom hosted services.
For usage details and examples, see
ServiceCallout policy .
ExternalCallout policy
The
ExternalCallout policy enables you to send gRPC requests to your gRPC server to
implement custom behavior that isn't supported by Apigee policies. For usage details
and examples, see
ExternalCallout policy .
TargetEndpoint
Specify a Google service or custom hosted service as an API proxy target endpoint.
For usage details and examples, see API Proxy configuration reference .
Google Auth Token supported contexts
The <Authentication> element has two sub-element configurations:
<GoogleAccessToken> or <GoogleIDToken> . The following
table shows the contexts in which these elements are supported:
Used in
GoogleAccessToken
GoogleIDToken
AssignMessage policy

ServiceCallout policy

ExternalCallout policy
Not supported

Supported
Note: The ExternalCallout policy cannot call Google APIs, so
Google access tokens
are not supported by the policy. However, OpenID Connect tokens are supported, so if the target
service is hosted in, for example, Cloud Run,
the policy can seamlessly connect to it.
Caution: Avoid using non-SSL dynamic targets. For example, avoid
overriding the target.url
flow variable to point to a non-SSL target endpoint. If you use a non-SSL dynamic target, the Google Auth Token will
still be generated; however, the authentication token will be exposed in plain text.
Deployment steps
This section explains how to deploy an API proxy that uses Google authentication to call
targeted Google services or custom hosted services. We explain the deployment steps for Apigee and Apigee hybrid separately.
Note:
Shared flow deployments also support use
of the Authentication tag in the supported policies and TargetEndpoint configuration. See
also the Shared flow deployment API documentation.
Deploy on Apigee
The following steps explain how to deploy an API proxy on Apigee, where the proxy is configured to make
authenticated calls to Google services or custom hosted services. The steps assume that you have already created the proxy, and
that it includes an <Authentication> element in one of the listed supported contexts .
Create a Google service account in the same Google Cloud
project where your
Apigee organization was created. You can create the service account in the Google Cloud console or with
the Google Cloud CLI. See
Creating and managing service accounts .
You must provide this service account's name when you deploy an API proxy that
is configured to use Google authentication, and the OAuth tokens that are generated will represent
the service account.
Give the user who will do the deployment (the deployer) the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
permission on the service account. See
About service account permissions and
Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources .
Caution: Users granted the Service Account
User role on a service account can use it to indirectly access all the resources
to which the service account has access. For details, see
Service Account User role .
We recommend configuring the service account for
least privilege
to minimize the impact of user role assignments.
Note: This step may be optional if the deployer already has
sufficient permission, for example, when deploying through the UI and the Google Cloud user has the Owner
role on the project.
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member=" MEMBER " \
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
With:
SA_NAME : The name that you provided when you created the service account.
PROJECT_ID : The project ID. The ID is the same as your organization name.
MEMBER : The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain .
Ensure that the Apigee service account has the ability to impersonate the proxy service account. To provide
this ability, grant the Apigee service account the iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
role on the proxy service account. See also
About service account permissions .
To configure your service account with this role using the gcloud CLI:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
--member="serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-apigee.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
With:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL : The email for your service account.
PROJECT_NUMBER : Your Google Cloud project number.
See
Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources .
Give the service account permissions needed to talk to your targeted Google services. For example,
if you want to call the Google Logging service, this service account must include
the required permissions to talk to that service. See also
Understanding roles .
Before deploying an API proxy that is configured to use Google authentication, you need:
The name of the service account you created previously. For example:
SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
As the user performing the deployment (the deployer), you must already have or be granted the
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on the service account, as noted in Step 2.
Deploy the API proxy containing the Google authentication configuration you implemented. You can
use the Apigee UI or API to deploy the proxy. To learn more, see Deploying an API proxy .
If using the UI, you are asked to provide a service account name. Use the name
of the proxy service account you created in Step 1. For example: SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com .
When deploying the proxy using the Apigee deployment API , here's an example
cURL command that you can use. Notice
that the command includes a service account name as a query parameter. This is the name
of the service account you created in Step 1:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
"https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG_NAME /environments/ ENV_NAME /apis/apiproxy/revisions/2/deployments?serviceAccount= SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST
Where:
TOKEN : An OAuth token that you must obtain in exchange for your Google
credentials. For details, see Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token .
ORG_NAME : Your Apigee organization name.
ENV_NAME : The name of the environment to deploy the API proxy to.
SA_NAME : The name that you provided when you created the service account.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID (same as the organization name).
When the deployment completes, test your API proxy to make sure the Google service returns
the expected response.
Deploy on Apigee hybrid
The following steps explain how to deploy to Apigee hybrid an API proxy that is configured to make
authenticated calls to Google services.
The steps assume that you have already created the proxy, and
that it includes an <Authentication> element in one of the listed supported contexts .
Note: Steps 1-3 below are required, but are one-time setup steps.
Before you begin, we recommend confirming that all required APIs are enabled, as described in
Step 1: Enable APIs .
Create a service account and key for the Apigee hybrid runtime component by using
one of the following methods:
Note: If you already created an apigee-runtime service
account when you installed Apigee hybrid, then you can skip this step.
Use the
create-service-account tool supplied with Apigee hybrid to create an apigee-runtime service
account. The tool creates the service account and returns a service account key. See
create-service-account
for details.
Create the service account in the Google Cloud console or with
the gcloud CLI. See Creating and managing service accounts .
To fetch the service account key, see
Creating and managing service account keys .
Note: You can create the runtime service account in any Google Cloud
project where you have permission to do so. It does not have to be created in the same project
used for your Apigee organization.
Open your overrides.yaml file and specify the path to the service account key file
for each environment that requires Google authentication capability:
envs:
- name: " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
serviceAccountPaths:
runtime: " KEY_FILE_PATH "
Note: If you have multiple environments that require Google
Authentication capability, each can have its own service account, or they can all share
the same one. See also About service account
permissions .
For example:
envs:
- name: "test"
serviceAccountPaths:
runtime: "./service_accounts/my_runtime_sa.json"
Apply the overrides file to your cluster using
Helm :
helm upgrade ENV_NAME apigee-env/ \
--namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \
--set env= ENV_NAME \
--atomic \
-f overrides .yaml
Create a second service account, which we call the proxy
service account. This service account must be in the same Google Cloud
project you used to create your
Apigee organization. You must provide this service account's email address when you deploy an API
proxy that is configured to use Google authentication, and the OAuth tokens that are generated
will represent the service account.
Give the user who will do the deployment (the deployer) the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
permission on the service account. See also
About service account permissions .
Caution: Users granted the Service Account
User role on a service account can use it to indirectly access all the resources
to which the service account has access. For details, see
Service Account User role .
We recommend configuring the service account for
least privilege
to minimize the impact of user role assignments.
Note: This step may be optional if the deployer already has
sufficient permission, for example, when deploying through the UI and the Google Cloud user has the Owner
role on the project.
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member=" MEMBER " \
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
Where:
PROJECT_ID : The project ID. The ID is the same as your organization name.
SA_NAME : The name you provided when you created the service account.
MEMBER : The member to add the binding for. Should be of the form
user|group|serviceAccount:email or domain:domain .
Give the proxy service account permissions needed to talk to your targeted Google services. For example,
if you want to call the Google Logging service, this service account must include
the required permissions to talk to that service. See also
Understanding roles .
Ensure that the runtime has the ability to impersonate the
proxy service account. To provide this ability, grant the runtime service account the
iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role
on the proxy service account. See also About service account
permissions . For example:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
PROXY_SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member=serviceAccount: RUNTIME_SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role=roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
Where:
PROJECT_ID : The project ID. The ID is the same as your organization
name. Note that you did not have to use the project associated with your organization to
create the runtime service account. Just be sure you use the correct project IDs in this command.
PROXY_SA_NAME : The ID for the proxy service account.
RUNTIME_SA_NAME : The ID for the runtime service account.
Before deploying an API proxy that is configured to use Google authentication, you need:
The name of the proxy service account you created previously. For example:
PROXY_SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
As the user performing the deployment, you must already have or be granted the
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission in the Google Cloud project
where the Apigee organization is provisioned. See
Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources .
Deploy the API proxy containing the Google authentication configuration you implemented. You can
use the Apigee UI or API to deploy the proxy. To learn more, see Deploying an API proxy .
If using the UI, you are asked to provide a service account name. Use the name
of the proxy service account you created previously. For example: PROXY_SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com .
If you prefer to deploy the proxy using the Apigee deployment API , here's an example
cURL command that you can use. Notice
that the command includes a service account name as a query parameter. This is the name
of the proxy service account:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
"https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG_NAME /environments/ ENV_NAME /apis/apiproxy/revisions/2/deployments?serviceAccount= PROXY_SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST
Where:
TOKEN : An OAuth token that you must obtain in exchange for your Google
credentials. For details, see Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token .
ORG_NAME : Your Apigee organization name.
ENV_NAME : The name of the environment to deploy the API proxy to.
PROXY_SA_NAME : The name of the proxy service account.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID (same as the organization name).
When the deployment completes, test your API proxy to make sure the Google service returns
the expected response.
About service account permissions
To configure an API proxy to use Google authentication, you must create a service account as described
in the following table.
See also
Creating and managing service accounts .
Service account
Required for
Description
Proxy
Apigee and Apigee hybrid
Has permissions needed for an API proxy to make authenticated calls to targeted Google
services.
Must be created in the same Google Cloud project as your Apigee
organization.
The user performing the deployment (the deployer), must have or be granted the
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on the proxy service account.
Must include permissions needed to talk to specific target Google services. For example,
if you want to call the Google Logging service, this service account must include
the required permissions to talk to that service. See also
Understanding roles .
The name of the service account must be provided when you deploy the proxy
that uses Google authentication.
Runtime
Apigee hybrid only
Allows the Apigee runtime to generate tokens to authenticate on Google services requested
by an API proxy. This service account "impersonates" the proxy-specific
service account to make authenticated calls on its behalf.
To be able to impersonate the proxy service account and create
tokens, the runtime service account must be granted the role
roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator on the proxy service account.
