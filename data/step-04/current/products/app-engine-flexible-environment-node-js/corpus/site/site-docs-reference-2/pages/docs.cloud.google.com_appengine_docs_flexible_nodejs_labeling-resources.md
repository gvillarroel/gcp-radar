Labeling App Engine resources
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Labels are a lightweight way to group together resources that are related or
associated with each other. You can use labels to get a more fine-grained view
of how resources are billed for your App Engine services. You can also
take advantage of features like nested filtering to perform more precise
searches for your resources.
Here are some ways you can use labels:
Label the types of services you create. For example, if you add labels such
as service:default , service:backend and service:frontend to your
App Engine services, you can compare how these different services use
outgoing bandwidth, instance hours, and other
resources .
Label by team or cost center to distinguish projects owned by
different teams. This can be used in cost accounting or budgeting. For
example, team:marketing and team:research .
Label the environment a service is running in. For example,
environment:prod and environment:test .
Label by owner or primary contact if there's an individual who is
responsible for a resource.
Label the status of a service. For example, state:inuse and
state:readyfordeletion .
Labels can be used only for billing data and not for any other tools, such as
the Metrics Explorer.
Restrictions
You can assign up to 64 labels to each resource.
You can only explicitly label services. Versions and instances inherit
labels from their parent service.
The App Engine flexible environment does not support billing labels for Firestore in Datastore mode (Datastore) usage.
Adding or modifying labels
To add labels to App Engine services:
Console
Go to the App Engine Services page.
Go to Services
Select the checkboxes next to the services you want to label.
Click Show info panel and select the Labels tab to expand the labels
column.
Click Add label to add a key-value pair to the services you selected. For
example, to add the label env:prod , enter env for the Key and prod
for the Value .
Save your changes.
Admin API
You can add and set labels through the Service resource. Refer to the
Admin API reference documentation:
REST API
RPC API
Viewing billing data associated with your labeled services
You can add granularity to billing data for your application using labels. For
example, you can view the costs for a specific resource, such as the outgoing
bandwidth, broken down by day and by service. This can give you insight into
daily application costs and allow you to optimize your application's resource use.
To view labels for billing, export your data to BigQuery and then query
the data:
Export your billing data to BigQuery .
After you enable the BigQuery export, it might take a few
hours to see your data.
From the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console ,
select your project and billing dataset.
Run a query against the table created from your BigQuery
export.
Labels are added to your dataset as repeated fields, which that means multiple
labels can be attached to a single row in your cost dataset. To easily query by
label, you might want to
FLATTEN the table on the labels
field.
For example, the following query pulls cost data, the label key, and the label
value for outgoing bandwidth where a label exists:
SELECT
product ,
resource_type ,
start_time ,
end_time ,
labels . key ,
labels . value ,
cost
FROM ( FLATTEN ([ YOUR_DATASET . TABLEID ], labels ))
WHERE
cost > 0.0
and labels . key is not null
and resource_type = ' Out Bandwidth '
LIMIT 100
BigQuery returns your data with a flattened output:
product
resource_type
start_time
end_time
labels_key
labels_value
cost

Time periods in billing reports
To ensure that each day in the report covers a full 24 hour period, the billing
data that you export only contains data up to the most recent midnight, Pacific
Time. For example, if you export billing data at noon on December 3rd, the
export includes data up to December 2nd, 11:59 PM.
For each day in the report, billing data is attributed to labels that
exist at the beginning of the day. For example, if you create a label at noon
Pacific Time on December 3rd, the report for December 3rd will not attribute
data to the label since the label did not exist at the beginning of the day.
Data will be attributed to the label starting December 4th.
Labels created at noon and removed in the same 24 hour period will not have data
attributed to it.
Viewing labels in the Google Cloud console
After you label resources, you can view the labels in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the App Engine Services page.
Go to Services
For each service, you can see all the labels in the Labels column.
Removing labels
To remove labels from services:
Go to the App Engine Services page.
Go to App Engine Services
Select the checkboxes next to the services for which you want to remove
labels.
Click Show info panel and select the Labels tab to expand the labels
column.
Click the X next to all the labels you want to remove.
Save your changes.
