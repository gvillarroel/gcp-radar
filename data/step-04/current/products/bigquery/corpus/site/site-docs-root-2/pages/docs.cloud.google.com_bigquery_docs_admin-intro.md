Introduction to BigQuery administration
This document provides an introduction to BigQuery administration
tasks, and the BigQuery features that
help you accomplish them.
BigQuery administrators typically do the following types of
tasks:
Manage resources, such as projects, datasets, and tables.
Secure resources, so that access is limited to the principals who need it.
Manage workloads, such as jobs, queries, and compute capacity (reservations).
Monitor resources, including quotas, jobs, and compute usage.
Optimize workloads for best performance while controlling costs.
Troubleshoot error messages, billing issues, and quotas.
This document gives an overview of the features that BigQuery
provides to help you do these tasks.
To take a tour of BigQuery data administration features
directly in the Google Cloud console, click Take the tour .
Take the tour
Tools
BigQuery provides several interfaces you can use for administration tasks.
Often a particular task can be done with
multiple tools, letting you choose the tool that works best for you. For
example, you can create a table by using the Explorer pane in the
Google Cloud console, a bq mk --table command, or a CREATE TABLE SQL
statement.
Google Cloud console. The Google Cloud console has several pages dedicated
to BigQuery administration. For more information, see
Use the Google Cloud console .
SQL statements. The BigQuery page in the
Google Cloud console has
a query editor where you can do administrative tasks by using DDL and DCL
statements. For more information, see
Data definition language (DDL)
and
Data control language (DCL) .
You can use stored procedures to automate administration tasks that use
SQL statements. For more information, see
Work with stored procedures .
bq commands. The bq command-line tool lets you do many administrative tasks by using
bq commands. You can use the bq command-line tool to do tasks that aren't
supported in the Google Cloud console, to prototype capabilities before
encoding them in queries or API methods, or if you prefer working in a
command-line interface. For more information, see
Use the bq command-line tool .
Manage resources
BigQuery resources include organizations, folders, projects,
datasets, and tables. This section describes how to manage
your organization's resources.
For information about the BigQuery resource hierarchy, see
Organize BigQuery resources .
In particular, you can create an Organization resource, which lets you do
some tasks, such as setting access controls, at the organization level.
Manage datasets
Datasets are containers for tables. You can create tables in a dataset, and then
manage them as a group. For example, you can configure a dataset's default
table expiration time, which applies to all tables in the dataset unless you
override it. You can copy a group of tables by making a copy of their dataset,
and you can control access to tables at the dataset level.
Refer to the following documents for more information about dataset
administration:
For more information about creating, copying, moving, and updating datasets,
see Introduction to datasets .
For more information about dataset-level access control, see
Controlling access to datasets and
Authorized datasets .
Manage tables
In BigQuery, data is stored in tables, where it can be queried.
You can create tables, load data into tables from various types of sources and
in various formats, partition tables based on a specific column or by ingestion
time, cluster tables, update table properties, and export table data.
Refer to the following documents for more information about table
administration:
For more information about loading data into BigQuery tables,
see
Introduction to loading tables .
For more information about managing tables and exporting table data, see
Introduction to tables .
For more information about partitioning and clustering tables, see
Introduction to partitioned tables and
Introduction to clustered tables .
Label resources
To help organize your BigQuery resources, you can add labels to
your datasets, tables, and views. Labels are key-value pairs that you can attach
to a resource. After labeling your resources, you can search for them based on
label values. For example, you could use labels to group datasets by department
by adding labels like dept:sales , dept:marketing , or dept:analytics .
Then you could break down your billed charges
by department using the labels.
For more information, see Introduction to labels .
Get resource information
You can get information about your BigQuery resources by querying
the INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. BigQuery provides views
for each resource type. For example, the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES view contains
information about your tables.
The following are a few examples of information you can obtain by querying
INFORMATION_SCHEMA views:
See when a table was created.
Get the names and data types of each column in a table.
Find all of the jobs running in a project.
Get a list of the table snapshots that were created from a base
table.
For a dataset, table, view, or routine, get the DDL statement that can be
used to create the resource.
Get the options that were used to create a table (for example, table
expiration).
Find the partitioning and clustering columns on a table.
Get a project's assigned reservation and its slot capacity.
For more information, see Introduction to BigQuery
INFORMATION_SCHEMA .
Copy data
You might want to create copies of
your data for various reasons, such as protection from human error, or to retain
data for comparison in the future.
BigQuery provides several options for copying a table's data from
a particular point in time.
Time travel. You might need to access a table's state as it was sometime
within the past
week; for example, if the data became corrupted due to human error.
BigQuery retains historical data for your tables for
seven days. You can access a table's recent historical data by using the
time travel feature.
For more information, see
Access historical data using time travel .
Table snapshots.
If you want to be able to access a table's state from earlier than one week in
the past, consider creating
table snapshots periodically.
Table snapshots are lightweight, read-only copies that let you
preserve the state of your tables indefinitely. With table snapshots, for
example, you can compare a table's current data to the data from the beginning
of the year, which isn't possible by using time travel.
You are only charged for storing the data that differs between the base
table and its table snapshot.
For more information, see
Introduction to table snapshots .
Table clones.
If you want to make a lightweight, writable copy of a table, you can use
table clones. You only pay for storage of
the data that differs between a base table and its table clone. For example, you
could create table clones in a test environment so that you can experiment with
copies of production data without impacting the production data and without
having to pay for storage of full copies of the tables.
For more information, see
Introduction to table clones .
Track data lineage
Data lineage is a Knowledge Catalog feature that
lets you track how data moves through your systems: where it comes from,
where it is passed to, and what transformations are applied to it.
For more information about how data lineage can help you track data movement in your
project, see About data lineage
in Knowledge Catalog.
Secure resources
BigQuery security is based on
Google Cloud Identity and Access Management .
BigQuery lets you control access to your resources at many
levels, including access to the organization, folders, projects, datasets,
tables, table columns, and table rows.
For information about controlling access to your BigQuery
resources, see
Overview of data security and governance .
Manage workloads
BigQuery does many tasks on behalf of your users,
including ingesting, querying, and exporting data. Each task is done by
a BigQuery job . This section describes how you can monitor
and manage your organization's jobs.
Manage jobs
Jobs are actions that BigQuery runs on a user's behalf to load,
export, query, or copy data. When a user initiates one of these tasks by using
the Google Cloud console , the
bq command-line tool , a
SQL statement , or an
API call , BigQuery automatically
creates a job to execute the task.
As a BigQuery administrator, you can monitor, manage, and
troubleshoot your organization's jobs to ensure they are running smoothly.
For more information, see Manage jobs .
Manage reservations
When BigQuery executes queries, it uses units of computing called
slots . BigQuery calculates how many
slots are needed to run each query, depending on the size and complexity of the
query.
BigQuery has two pricing models for charging for the slots that
run your queries:
On-demand billing. Your queries use a shared pool of slots, and you are
charged for the number of bytes your queries process. For more information on
on-demand billing limits, see Query jobs .
Capacity-based billing. You assign a reservation or capacity commitment to an
edition, each of which comes with their own feature set and price point to
provide the best working environment for you.
These pricing models apply per project, so you can have some projects that use
on-demand billing and some projects that use capacity-based billing.
With on-demand billing, after your monthly allocation of
free usage is consumed, you are charged for the
number of bytes that each query processes. Throughput is limited to a predefined
slot quota, which is shared among the queries that run in a project.
With BigQuery editions billing, you allocate slots for your organization through
autoscaling reservations and optional, but cheaper, capacity commitments. Slots
for each edition come at their own price point, and offer their own set of
features. For more information about BigQuery editions and the features that are
associated with them, see Introduction to
BigQuery editions .
Refer to the following documents for more information about managing compute
capacity for processing your queries:
For slots, and the trade-offs between on-demand billing
and capacity-based billing, see
Introduction to reservations .
For the different options for capacity-based billing (monthly or annual commitments), see
Slot commitments .
For creating pools of capacity-based slots, called slot
reservations , see
Work with slot reservations .
For allocating slot reservations to specific projects,
see
Work with reservation assignments .
For estimating the right number of slots to allocate to your
workloads, see
Estimate slot capacity requirements .
Monitor resources
Google Cloud provides the capability to monitor and audit your
resources,
including BigQuery resources. This section describes the
Google Cloud monitoring and auditing capabilities that apply
to BigQuery.
For more information, see Introduction to BigQuery
monitoring .
The Cloud Monitoring dashboard
Cloud Monitoring provides a dashboard for monitoring BigQuery.
Use this dashboard to view information about BigQuery incidents,
datasets, tables, projects, query times, and slot utilization.
For more information, see
View the Monitoring dashboard .
Administration charts and alerts
You can use Cloud Monitoring to create custom charts based on the
resources, metrics, and any aggregation that you specify.
For more information, see
Dashboards and charts .
You can also create alert policies that notify you if the configured alert is
triggered. For example, you could create an alert that sends an email to a
specified email address if the execution time of a query exceeds a specified
limit.
For more information, see
Creating an alert .
Monitor reservations
You can monitor your slot usage on the Capacity management page of the
Google Cloud console. You can view your capacity commitments and see where your
slot reservations have been assigned. You can also use the Slot estimator
( Preview ) to help you estimate your organization's
capacity requirements based on historical performance metrics.
For more information, see
Monitoring BigQuery reservations .
Quotas
Google Cloud sets limits on the use of resources, including
BigQuery resources, both to
ensure fair usage of shared resources, and to protect you from runaway costs.
You can view your usage of BigQuery resources that have
quotas , and
request a higher quota , if
needed, by using the Google Cloud console.
For more information, see
BigQuery quotas and limits .
Audit logs
Cloud Audit Logs maintain a record of Google Cloud events, including BigQuery
events. You can use the Logs Explorer to query the logs about events related
to BigQuery jobs, datasets, transfers, and more. The Logs
Dashboard displays information about recent errors, and you can use
Logs-based metrics to count the log entries that match a given filter.
For more information, see the
Google Cloud logging documentation .
Optimize workloads
You can optimize your BigQuery configuration to control both
storage and query processing costs.
For assistance managing your BigQuery storage costs, see
Optimize storage in BigQuery .
For assistance managing your BigQuery processing costs, see
Control costs in BigQuery .
For assistance optimizing your BigQuery
queries, see
Introduction to optimizing query performance .
