Manage listings
This document describes how to manage listings in BigQuery sharing
(formerly Analytics Hub). As a BigQuery sharing publisher, you can do the following:
Create listings in a data exchange for which you have publishing access.
Update, delete, share, and view usage metrics for listings.
Manage different BigQuery sharing roles for your listings, such as
listing administrators, subscribers, and viewers.
View all subscribers who subscribed to your listing.
Monitor usage
of your listings.
Remove subscribers from your listing.
A listing is a reference to a shared dataset that a publisher lists in a
data exchange .
A listing can be of the following two types based on the
Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that's set for the listing and the type of
data exchange that contains the listing:
Public listing. A public listing can be
discovered
and
subscribed to
by
Google Cloud users ( allAuthenticatedUsers ) .
Listings in a public data exchange are public listings. These listings can be
references to a free public dataset or a commercial dataset . If the
listing is of a commercial dataset, BigQuery sharing subscribers can
either request access to the listing directly from the data provider, or they
can browse and purchase
Google Cloud Marketplace-integrated commercial listings .
Private listing. A private listing is shared directly with individuals or
groups. For example, a private listing can reference marketing metrics dataset that you share with other internal teams within your organization. Even though you can
allow Google Cloud users ( allAuthenticatedUsers )
to subscribe to your listings, the listing will remain private and won't
show as a public listing on the BigQuery sharing page .
To share such listings with users, share the listing's URL with them. To make
a private listing discoverable,
make your exchange public .
Note: Both requesting access and Cloud Marketplace-integrated flows are
supported on a single BigQuery sharing listing. This means that you
can create a Cloud Marketplace-integrated listing from an existing
(offline) commercial listing, without any disruptions to existing subscriptions.
Before you begin
To get started with BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub), you need to
enable the Analytics Hub API inside your Google Cloud project.
To enable the Analytics Hub API, you need the following
Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions:
serviceUsage.services.get
serviceUsage.services.list
serviceUsage.services.enable
The following predefined IAM role includes the
permissions that you need to enable the Analytics Hub API:
Service Usage Admin ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin )
To enable the Analytics Hub API, select one of the following options:
Console
Go to the Analytics Hub API page and enable the Analytics Hub API for
your Google Cloud project.
Enable the Analytics Hub API
gcloud
Run the gcloud services enable
command:
gcloud services enable analyticshub.googleapis.com
Required roles
To manage listings and subscriptions, you must have one of the following
BigQuery sharing Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles:
Analytics Hub Publisher role
( roles/analyticshub.publisher ), which lets you
create, update, delete, and set IAM policies on your listings.
Analytics Hub Listing Admin role
( roles/analyticshub.listingAdmin ), which lets you
update, delete, and set IAM policies on your listings.
Analytics Hub Admin role
( roles/analyticshub.admin ), which lets you
create, update, delete, and set IAM policies on all listings in
your data exchange.
For more information, see
BigQuery sharing IAM roles .
To learn how to grant these roles to other users, see
Create a listing administrator .
To create listings or to update replica regions for a listing,
you must have the bigquery.datasets.get
and bigquery.datasets.update permissions for the datasets where you want
to create or update listings. The following
BigQuery predefined roles
contain the bigquery.datasets.update permission:
BigQuery Data Owner
( roles/bigquery.dataOwner )
BigQuery Admin
( roles/bigquery.admin )
To view all data exchanges across projects in an organization that you have
access to, you must have the resourcemanager.organizations.get permission.
There are no
BigQuery predefined roles
that contain this permission, so you would need to use an
IAM custom role .
View data exchanges
To view the list of data exchanges in your organization that you have access to,
see
View data exchanges .
If the data exchange is in another organization, then the
BigQuery sharing administrator must
share a link to that data exchange
with you.
Create a listing
A listing is a reference to a
shared dataset
that a BigQuery sharing publisher lists in a data exchange.
Caution: We recommend that you don't add your shared datasets in a
Google Cloud project with a VPC Service Controls perimeter. If you do so, then you
must add the appropriate
ingress and egress rules .
To create a listing, follow these steps:
Console
Go to the Sharing (Analytics Hub) page.
Go to Sharing (Analytics Hub)
A page appears that lists all data exchanges that you can access.
Click the data exchange name in which you want to create the listing.
Click add_box
Create listing .
In the Configure data section, in the Resource type menu, select
BigQuery dataset or Pub/Sub Topic .
If you select BigQuery dataset , then do the following:
In the Shared dataset menu, select an existing dataset, or
click Create a dataset to create a new dataset. Select the
dataset that you want to list in the data exchange. The dataset must be in the same region as the data exchange. You cannot update this field after the listing is created. The source dataset name and the
ID of the project that contains the dataset are returned when BigQuery sharing subscribers
view the metadata of their linked dataset .
Optional: To let subscribers
share a SQL stored procedure within a listing ,
select Allow stored procedure sharing
( Preview ).
Expand the Region data availability menu
( Preview )
to make the shared dataset available in additional regions. The
menu displays the regions where dataset replicas exist with the
Ready to use label. Before configuring the listing for multiple
regions, verify you've enabled
cross-region dataset replication
on the shared dataset, as you can select only regions where
cross-region dataset replication is enabled. All other regions are
labeled as Unavailable . If no additional region is selected, the
listing uses the shared dataset primary region by default, which is
labeled as Provider primary .
In Data Egress controls , select the appropriate data egress
option.
To apply data egress restrictions on your shared dataset, but not
on query results of your shared dataset, select
Disable copy and export of shared data .
To apply data egress restrictions on your shared dataset and query
results of your shared dataset, select
Disable copy and export of query results , which will
automatically set Disable copy and export of shared data as well.
To apply data API copy and export egress restrictions on your shared
dataset, select Disable copy and export of tables through APIs ,
which will automatically set Disable copy and export of shared data as well.
For more information about data egress controls, including
restrictions, see
Data egress options (BigQuery shared datasets only) .
If you select Pub/Sub Topic , then in the Shared topic menu, you
can select an existing Pub/Sub topic, or click Create a topic
to create a new topic.
In the Listing details section, in Display name , enter the name of the listing.
Enter the following optional details:
Category : select up to two categories that best represent your
listing. BigQuery sharing subscribers can
filter listings
based on these categories.
Data affinity : regions used by the BigQuery sharing publisher
for publishing the data if you're using a Pub/Sub topic. This
information is useful for BigQuery sharing subscribers to minimize
or avoid Pub/Sub network egress costs by reading the data from
the same region. For more information about egress costs, see
Data transfer costs .
Icon : an icon for your listing. PNG and JPEG file formats are
supported. Icons must have a file size of less than 512 KiB and
dimensions of no more than 512 x 512 pixels.
Description : a brief description about your listing. Subscribers can
search for listings
based on the description.
Public Discoverability : enable public discoverability of your
listing in the BigQuery sharing catalog. If you enable this option,
grant allUsers or allAuthenticatedUsers the
Analytics Hub Viewer role
( roles/analyticshub.viewer ). For more information, see
Grant the role for a listing .
If the exchange is already
public ,
listing permissions are already inherited and no further action is
required.
Publicly discoverable exchanges can't have private listings due to
permission inheritance, but private exchanges can have public listings.
For public listings to be created, the project the data listing is in
must have an associated organization and billing account. If you're
creating a
Cloud Marketplace-integrated commercial listing ,
we recommend making your listing publicly discoverable.
Subscriber Email Logging : turn on logging of the
principal identifiers
of all users running jobs and queries on linked datasets. When you enable
this option, all future subscriptions for this listing have subscriber
email logging turned on. The logged data is available in the
job_principal_subject field of the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SHARED_DATASET_USAGE view .
Note: Once you enable and save email logging, this setting cannot be
edited. To disable email logging, delete the listing and recreate
it without clicking the Subscriber Email Logging toggle.

view the metadata of their linked dataset .
Optional: To let subscribers
share a SQL stored procedure within a listing ,
select Allow stored procedure sharing
( Preview ).
Expand the Region data availability menu
( Preview )
to make the shared dataset available in additional regions. The menu displays
the regions where dataset replicas exist with the Ready to use
label. Before configuring the listing for multiple regions, verify
you've enabled
cross-region dataset replication
on the shared dataset, as you can select only regions where
cross-region dataset replication is enabled. All other regions are
labeled as Unavailable . If no additional region is selected, the
listing uses the shared dataset region by default, which is labeled
as Provider primary .
In Data Egress controls , select the appropriate data egress option.

If the exchange is already
public ,
listing permissions are already inherited and no further action is required.
Publicly discoverable exchanges can't have private listings due to
permission inheritance, but private exchanges can have public listings. For
public listings to be created, the project the data listing is in must have
an associated organization and billing account. If you're creating a
Cloud Marketplace-integrated commercial listing ,
we recommend making your listing publicly discoverable.
Subscriber Email Logging : turn on logging of the
principal identifiers of subscribers
running jobs and queries on this listing's linked dataset for all future
subscriptions. When you enable this option, only newly created
subscriptions log the principal identifiers. The logged data is available

You can share
SQL stored procedures
when creating listings with BigQuery datasets. Since stored
procedures can create, drop, and manipulate tables, as well as invoke
other stored procedures, additional authorization is needed.
Subscriber authorization
After subscribing to a listing, the linked stored procedures might not be
executed directly. To ensure that the linked stored procedures can be accessed,
the subscriber must communicate to the provider with the linked dataset name so that
the provider authorizes the linked stored procedure on the provider resources .
In addition, the subscriber must
authorize the linked shared stored procedure and attach an IAM role
to the resources that they own in order to read from and write to those
resources.
Provider authorization
When a provider creates a listing with a stored procedure, they need to let the
subscriber read from and write to their tables through the linked stored
procedure. To ensure this, do the following:
For non-read operations, the provider must
authorize the linked shared stored procedure and
attach an IAM role
to any of the provider's resources that are accessed by the linked stored
procedure.
For read operations, the provider can authorize either the linked shared stored
procedure (in the subscriber's linked dataset) or their original shared stored
procedure (in the provider's dataset) and
attach an IAM role
to any of the provider's resources that are accessed by the linked stored
procedure.
Give users access to a listing
If you want to give users access to a private listing, you must set
IAM policy for an individual or a group for that listing. For a
commercial listing, your
data exchange must be public .
Listings in a public data exchange appear in BigQuery sharing for all
Google Cloud users ( allAuthenticatedUsers ) .
To enable users to browse and request access to commercial listings, you must
grant users the
Analytics Hub Viewer role
( roles/analyticshub.viewer ). To enable users to subscribe to commercial
listings, you must explicitly grant users the
Analytics Hub Subscriber role
( roles/analyticshub.subscriber ). For
Cloud Marketplace-integrated commercial listings ,
the Analytics Hub Subscriber role is automatically provisioned
based on the Cloud Marketplace orders.
If you want to make your listing accessible to everyone, including people who
don't use Google Cloud, you must grant allUsers the Analytics Hub Viewer role
( roles/analyticshub.viewer ).
To give users access to view or subscribe to your listing, follow these steps:
Console
Go to the Sharing (Analytics Hub) page.
Go to Sharing (Analytics Hub)
Click the data exchange name that contains the listing.
Click the listing for which you want to add subscribers.
Click person Set permissions .
To add principals, click person_add
Add principal .
In the New principals field, add the following details based on the
type of listing:
For a private listing, enter email IDs of the identity to whom you want
to grant access.
For a public listing, add allAuthenticatedUsers .
For a public listing discoverable to everyone, including non-Google Cloud
users, add allUsers .
For Select a role , hold the pointer over Analytics Hub , and then
based on the type of listing, select one of the following roles:
For a commercial listing (including Cloud Marketplace-integrated
listings), select the Analytics Hub Viewer role. This role lets users
view the listing and request access .
For a private or non-commercial public listing, select the
Analytics Hub Subscriber role. This role lets users
subscribe to your listing .
For Cloud Marketplace-integrated listings, the
Analytics Hub Subscriber role ( roles/analyticshub.subscriber )
doesn't need to be granted, as subscriptions are automatically governed
and managed based on the Cloud Marketplace order.
Note: After you grant licenses to users to access
non-Cloud Marketplace-integrated commercial listings, you can
either create a private listing for those users, or grant those users the
Analytics Hub Subscriber ( roles/analyticshub.subscriber ) role for your commercial listing.
For more information, see the
Analytics Hub Subscriber and Viewer roles .
Click Save .
API
Read the existing policy with the listing getIamPolicy method by using
the
projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings.getIamPolicy method .
POST https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /dataExchanges/ DATAEXCHANGE_ID /listings/ LISTING_ID :getIamPolicy
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID—for example,
my-project-1 .
LOCATION : the location of the data exchange
that contains the listing.
DATAEXCHANGE_ID : the data exchange ID.
LISTING_ID : the listing ID.
Sharing returns the current policy in the response.
To add or remove members and their associated roles, edit the policy with
a text editor. Use the following format to add members:
user:test-user@gmail.com
group:admins@example.com
serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com
domain:example.domain.com
For example, to grant the roles/analyticshub.subscriber role to
group:subscribers@example.com , add the following binding to the policy:
{
"members": [
"group:subscribers@example.com"
],
"role":"roles/analyticshub.subscriber"
}
Write the updated policy by using the
projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings.setIamPolicy method .
In the body of the request, provide the updated IAM policy
from the previous step.
POST https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /location/ LOCATION /dataExchanges/ DATAEXCHANGE_ID /listings/ LISTING_ID :setIamPolicy
In the body of the request, provide the listing details. If the request
is successful, then the response body contains details of the listing.
For more information about the tasks that you can perform on listings using
APIs, see projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings methods .
Note: After you grant licenses to users to access your commercial listing, you
can either
create a private listing
for those users or grant those users the
Analytics Hub Subscriber role
( roles/analyticshub.subscriber ) for your commercial listing.
Create a non-authenticated URL for public listing
To create a non-authenticated BigQuery sharing listing URL that is
viewable to even non-Google Cloud users, do the following:
Go to the Sharing (Analytics Hub) page.
Go to Sharing (Analytics Hub)
A page appears that lists all data exchanges that you can access.
Click the data exchange name that contains the listing.
Click the display name to view the listing details. The listing must have
public discoverability
enabled.
Click Copy public link to generate an unauthenticated listing URL. Ensure
that this listing grants allUsers the
Analytics Hub Viewer role ( roles/analyticshub.viewer ).
Create a listing administrator
To let users manage listings, you must create listing administrators. To
create listing administrators, you need to grant users the
Analytics Hub Publisher or the Analytics Hub Listing Admin IAM role
at the listing level. For more information about how to grant these roles for a
listing, see
Grant the role for a listing .
View all subscriptions
To view all the current subscriptions to your listing, select one of the
