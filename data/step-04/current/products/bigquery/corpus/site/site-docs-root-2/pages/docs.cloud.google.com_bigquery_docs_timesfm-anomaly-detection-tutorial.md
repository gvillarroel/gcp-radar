Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial teaches you how to use the
AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES function
with BigQuery ML's built-in
TimesFM model to detect anomalies in time series data.
This tutorial uses data from the public
bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips
table.
Objectives
This tutorial guides you through using the AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES function with the built-in TimesFM model to detect anomalies in bike share trips. The first section covers how to detect anomalies and visualize results for a single time series. The second section covers how to detect anomalies for multiple time series.
Costs
This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud, including the following:

Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to

In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

Detect anomalies in a single bike share trips time series
Detect anomalies in time series data by using the AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES
function.
The following query detects anomalies in the number of bike share trips per
hour for the month of August 2017, based on the historical data from the previous month. The anomaly_prob_threshold argument indicates the threshold for identifying an anomaly.
Follow these steps to detect anomalies with the TimesFM model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run , the query takes 1-2 minutes to complete:
WITH
bike_share_trips AS (
SELECT
TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( start_date , HOUR ) AS trip_hour , COUNT ( * ) AS num_trips
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
GROUP BY TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( start_date , HOUR )
)
SELECT *
FROM
AI . DETECT_ANOMALIES (
(
SELECT *
FROM bike_share_trips
WHERE trip_hour >= TIMESTAMP ( '2017-07-01' ) AND trip_hour TIMESTAMP ( '2017-08-01' )
),
(
SELECT *
FROM bike_share_trips
WHERE trip_hour >= TIMESTAMP ( '2017-08-01' ) AND trip_hour TIMESTAMP ( '2017-09-01' )
),
anomaly_prob_threshold => 0.95 ,
timestamp_col => 'trip_hour' ,
data_col => 'num_trips' );
The results look similar to the following:
+-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
| time_series_timestamp | time_series_data | is_anomaly | lower_bound | upper_bound | anomaly_probability | ai_detect_anomalies_status|
+-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
| 2017-08-01 00:00:00 UTC | 13.0 | false | -1.97939332204... | 27.604928623830... | 0.38048622012138... | |
+-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
| 2017-08-01 01:00:00 UTC | 6.0 | false | -9.42939322810... | 20.154928628380... | 0.38048622012138... | |
+-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
+-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
When the query is finished running, click the Visualization tab. The resulting chart looks similar to the following:
You can identify the anomalies where the time_series_data value falls outside the lower_bound and upper_bound range.
Detect anomalies in multiple bike share trips time series
The following query detects anomalies in the number of bike share trips per subscriber type
and per hour for the month of August 2017, based on the historical data from the previous month.
Follow these steps to detect anomalies with the TimesFM model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
WITH
bike_share_trips AS (
SELECT
TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( start_date , HOUR ) AS trip_hour , COUNT ( * ) AS num_trips , subscriber_type
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
GROUP BY TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( start_date , HOUR ), subscriber_type
)
SELECT *
FROM
AI . DETECT_ANOMALIES (
(
SELECT *
FROM bike_share_trips
WHERE trip_hour >= TIMESTAMP ( '2017-07-01' ) AND trip_hour TIMESTAMP ( '2017-08-01' )
),
(
SELECT *
FROM bike_share_trips
WHERE trip_hour >= TIMESTAMP ( '2017-08-01' ) AND trip_hour TIMESTAMP ( '2017-09-01' )
),
anomaly_prob_threshold => 0.95 ,
timestamp_col => 'trip_hour' ,
data_col => 'num_trips' ,
id_cols => [ 'subscriber_type' ] );
The results look similar to the following:
+-----------------+-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
| subscriber_type | time_series_timestamp | time_series_data | is_anomaly | lower_bound | upper_bound | anomaly_probability | ai_detect_anomalies_status|

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete your project
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
