Create a k-means model to cluster London bicycle hires dataset
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial teaches you how to use a
k-means model
in BigQuery ML to identify clusters in a set of data.
The k-means
algorithm that groups your data into clusters is a form of unsupervised
machine learning. Unlike supervised machine learning, which is about predictive
analytics, unsupervised machine learning is about descriptive analytics.
Unsupervised machine learning can help you understand your data so that you can
make data-driven decisions.
The queries in this tutorial use
geography functions
available in geospatial analytics. For more information, see
Introduction to geospatial analytics .
This tutorial uses the
London Bicycle Hires public dataset . The data
includes start and stop timestamps, station names, and ride duration.
Objectives
This tutorial guides you through completing the following tasks:
Examine the data used to train the model.
Create a k-means clustering model.
Interpret the data clusters produced, using BigQuery ML's
visualization of the clusters.
Run the
ML.PREDICT function
on the k-means model to predict the likely cluster for a set of bike hire
stations.
Costs
This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud, including the following:

Create a dataset
Create a BigQuery dataset to store your k-means model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to the BigQuery page
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
If you don't see the left pane, click last_page Expand left pane to open the pane.
In the Explorer pane, click your project name.
Click more_vert View actions > Create dataset .
On the Create dataset page, do the following:
For Dataset ID , enter bqml_tutorial .
For Location type , select Multi-region , and then select
EU (multiple regions in European Union) .
The London Bicycle Hires public dataset is stored in the EU
multi-region . Your dataset must
be in the same location.
Leave the remaining default settings as they are, and click
Create dataset .
Examine the training data
Examine the data you will use to train your k-means model. In this
tutorial, you cluster bike stations based on the following attributes:
Duration of rentals
Number of trips per day
Distance from city center
SQL
This query extracts data on cycle hires, including the start_station_name
and duration columns, and joins this data with station information. This
includes creating a calculated column that contains the station distance
from the city center. Then, it computes attributes of
the station in a stationstats column, including the average duration of
rides and the number of trips, and the calculated distance_from_city_center
column.
Follow these steps to examine the training data:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
WITH
hs AS (
SELECT
h . start_station_name AS station_name ,
IF (
EXTRACT ( DAYOFWEEK FROM h . start_date ) = 1
OR EXTRACT ( DAYOFWEEK FROM h . start_date ) = 7 ,
'weekend' ,
'weekday' ) AS isweekday ,
h . duration ,
ST_DISTANCE ( ST_GEOGPOINT ( s . longitude , s . latitude ), ST_GEOGPOINT ( - 0.1 , 51.5 )) / 1000
AS distance_from_city_center
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` AS h

Create a k-means model
Create a k-means model using London Bicycle Hires training data.
SQL
In the following query, the CREATE MODEL statement specifies the number of
clusters to use — four. In the SELECT statement, the EXCEPT clause
excludes the station_name column because this column doesn't contain a
feature. The query creates a unique row per station_name, and only the
features are mentioned in the SELECT statement.
Follow these steps to create a k-means model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :

Interpret the data clusters
The information in the model's Evaluation tab can help you to interpret
the clusters produced by the model.
Follow these steps to view the model's evaluation information:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
In the Explorer pane, expand your project and click Datasets .
Click the bqml_tutorial dataset, and then go to the Models tab.
Select the london_station_clusters model.
Select the Evaluation tab. This tab displays visualizations of the
clusters identified by the k-means model. In the Numeric features
section, bar graphs display the most important numeric feature values for
each centroid. Each centroid represents a given cluster of data. You can
select which features to visualize from the drop-down menu.
This model creates the following centroids:
Centroid 1 shows a less busy city station, with shorter duration rentals.
Centroid 2 shows the second city station which is less busy and used for
longer duration rentals.
Centroid 3 shows a busy city station that is close to the city center.
Centroid 4 shows a suburban station with trips that are longer.
If you were running the bicycle hire business, you could use this information
to inform business decisions. For example:
Assume that you need to experiment with a new type of lock. Which cluster of
stations should you choose as a subject for this experiment? The stations in
centroid 1, centroid 2 or centroid 4 seem like logical choices because they
are not the busiest stations.
Assume that you want to stock some stations with racing bikes. Which stations
should you choose? Centroid 4 is the group of stations that are far from the
city center, and they have the longest trips. These are likely candidates for
racing bikes.
Use the ML.PREDICT function to predict a station's cluster
Identify the cluster to which a particular station belongs by using the
ML.PREDICT SQL function or the
predict BigQuery DataFrames function .
SQL
The following query uses the
REGEXP_CONTAINS
function to find all entries in the station_name column that contain the
string Kennington . The ML.PREDICT function uses those values to predict
which clusters might contain those stations.
Follow these steps to predict the cluster of every station that has
the string Kennington in its name:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
WITH
hs AS (
SELECT
h . start_station_name AS station_name ,
IF (
EXTRACT ( DAYOFWEEK FROM h . start_date ) = 1
OR EXTRACT ( DAYOFWEEK FROM h . start_date ) = 7 ,
'weekend' ,
'weekday' ) AS isweekday ,
h . duration ,
ST_DISTANCE ( ST_GEOGPOINT ( s . longitude , s . latitude ), ST_GEOGPOINT ( - 0.1 , 51.5 )) / 1000

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
You can delete the project you created.
Or you can keep the project and delete the dataset.
Delete your dataset
Deleting your project removes all datasets and all tables in the project. If you
prefer to reuse the project, you can delete the dataset you created in this
tutorial:
If necessary, open the BigQuery page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to the BigQuery page
In the navigation, click the bqml_tutorial dataset you created.
Click Delete dataset on the right side of the window.
This action deletes the dataset and the model.
In the Delete dataset dialog, confirm the delete command by typing
the name of your dataset ( bqml_tutorial ) and then click Delete .
Delete your project
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
