Stream sharing with Pub/Sub
You can share Pub/Sub topics through BigQuery sharing (formerly
Analytics Hub) to curate and distribute a library of streaming data across
multiple internal and external organizational boundaries. Real-time streaming data
is shared using BigQuery sharing exchanges and listings, which lets you
logically categorize and group large sets of Pub/Sub topics and
provision access at scale.
You can share streaming data to do the following:
Financial services :
Share rapidly changing instrument prices, quotes, and orders in real time.
Detect money laundering and payment fraud.
Support trading risk computations.
Retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) :
Manage store inventory in real time.
Personalize marketing and customer support.
Adjust prices dynamically.
Monitor social media channels.
Optimize physical store layouts.
Healthcare :
Power predictive algorithms to monitor patients and analyze risk in real
time.
Monitor vitals with wearable medical devices.
Automatically acquire, structure, store, and process data from patients, healthcare professionals, and facility administration.
Telecommunications :
Monitor network health and predict failures.
Discover user behavior patterns to better locate devices and antennas.
Required roles
The roles for sharing Pub/Sub topics are analogous to sharing BigQuery datasets:
Administrator : manages permissions, visibility, and membership of
exchanges and listings. This role is analogous to the
Analytics Hub Admin
( roles/analyticshub.admin ) IAM role.
Shared topic publisher : creates, manages, and grants access to listings
of the shared Pub/Sub topics. This role is analogous to the
Analytics Hub Publisher or Analytics Hub Listing Admin
IAM role. The publisher is a user, not the
publisher application
that creates and sends messages to the topic.
Shared topic subscriber : subscribes to the shared topic listing. Shared
topic subscribers can configure how topic messages are delivered. This role is
analogous to the
Analytics Hub Subscriber
or
Analytics Hub Subscription Owner
IAM role. Depending on how the message data is delivered,
additional permissions may be required, such as
Pub/Sub service account permissions
for writing messages to BigQuery.
Architecture
The following diagram describes how publishers and subscribers of
Pub/Sub resources interact with BigQuery sharing:
Figure 1. Shared topic publisher and subscriber workflow with Pub/Sub topics.
Shared topics
A shared topic is the unit for sharing a Pub/Sub topic in
BigQuery sharing. As a shared topic publisher, you create or use an
existing Pub/Sub topic to distribute message data to subscribers.
BigQuery sharing doesn't replicate the source Pub/Sub topic.
Listings
A listing is created when a publisher adds a shared topic to an exchange. It references the shared topic.
Exchanges
An exchange is a logical grouping of listings that reference shared topics.
Linked Pub/Sub subscriptions
When subscribing to a listing with a shared topic, a linked
Pub/Sub subscription is created in the shared topic subscriber
project. The shared topic publisher's project also represents a
Pub/Sub subscription as a Pub/Sub subscription and
a Sharing listing subscription.
Limitations
Stream sharing with Pub/Sub has the following limitations:
A shared topic supports a maximum of 10,000 Pub/Sub
subscriptions. This limit includes linked Pub/Sub subscriptions
and Pub/Sub subscriptions created outside of
Sharing, for example, those created directly from
Pub/Sub.
Shared topics are indexed in Data Catalog (deprecated) and Knowledge Catalog, but you cannot filter specifically for their resource type.
Usage metrics are captured and displayed in the Metrics dashboard for
shared Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions, but are not
available in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SHARED_DATASET_USAGE .
To monitor metrics, see Monitor Pub/Sub in
Cloud Monitoring .
These metrics can include the following:
Publish message count
Publish requests
Publish throughput in bytes
Top 5 subscriptions
Ingested bytes
Others
Enable the Analytics Hub API
To enable the Analytics Hub API, do the following:
Console
Go to the API library and enable the Analytics Hub API for your
Google Cloud project.
Enable the Analytics Hub API
gcloud
Run the gcloud services enable
command:
gcloud services enable analyticshub.googleapis.com
Enable the Pub/Sub API
Go to the API library and enable the Pub/Sub API for your
Google Cloud project.
Enable the Pub/Sub API
Shared topic publisher workflows
As a shared topic publisher, you can do the following:
Add shared topics to an exchange by creating a listing.
Update a listing.
Delete a listing.
Share a listing.
Manage subscriptions to your listing.
Remove subscribers from your listing.
Additional publisher permissions
To perform shared topic publisher tasks, you must have the
Analytics Hub Publisher role
( roles/analyticshub.publisher ) on an exchange or listing. To view all the
data exchanges
across projects in an organization that you have access to, you must have the
resourcemanager.organizations.get permission.
In addition, you need the pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy permission on the
Pub/Sub topic you want to list. To share topics with a schema
attached, you must grant BigQuery sharing subscribers the
pubsub.schemas.get permission on the schema attached to the topic. This
permission lets BigQuery sharing subscribers properly parse messages from
the Pub/Sub subscription.
Create a listing (to add a shared topic)
To add a shared topic to a listing, select one of the following options:
Console
Go to the Sharing (Analytics Hub) page.

PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the subscription that
you want to remove.
LOCATION : the location of the subscription.
SUBSCRIPTION_ID : the ID of the subscription that
you want to remove.
When you revoke a subscription from BigQuery sharing, a shared topic
subscriber no longer receives message data from the shared topic. The
Pub/Sub subscription is detached from the shared topic. If you
delete a subscription directly from Pub/Sub, the
BigQuery sharing subscription persists and requires cleanup.
Subscriber workflows
As a BigQuery sharing subscriber, you can view and subscribe to a listing.
Subscribing to a listing of a shared topic creates one linked
Pub/Sub subscription in the subscriber's project. The
Pub/Sub subscription is visible in the shared topic publisher's
project.
Additional subscriber permissions
You must have the
Analytics Hub Subscriber
( roles/analyticshub.subscriber ) role granted at the project, exchange, or
listing-level to perform subscriber tasks.
Subscribe to a shared topic listing
To subscribe to a listing with a shared topic, select one of the following options:
