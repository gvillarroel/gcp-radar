Use BigQuery ML to predict penguin weight
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In this tutorial, you use a
linear regression model
in BigQuery ML to predict the weight of a penguin based on the
penguin's demographic information. A linear regression is a type of regression
model that generates a continuous value from a linear combination of input
features.
This tutorial uses the
bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins
dataset.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you will perform the following tasks:
Create a linear regression model.
Evaluate the model.
Make predictions by using the model.
Note: This tutorial covers linear regression in pure SQL. For a linear
regression tutorial using Python and BigQuery DataFrames on the same dataset,
see Create a regression model with BigQuery DataFrames .

bqclient . create_dataset ( "bqml_tutorial" , exists_ok = True )
Create the model
Create a linear regression model using the Analytics sample
dataset for BigQuery.
SQL
You can create a linear regression model by using the
CREATE MODEL statement
and specifying LINEAR_REG for the model type. Creating the model includes
training the model.
The following are useful things to know about the CREATE MODEL statement:
The input_label_cols
option specifies which column in the SELECT statement
to use as the label column. Here, the label column is body_mass_g . For
linear regression models, the label column must be real-valued, that is,
the column values must be real numbers.
This query's SELECT statement uses the following columns in the
bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins table to predict a penguin's
weight:
species : the species of penguin.
island : the island that the penguin resides on.
culmen_length_mm : the length of the penguin's culmen in millimeters.
culmen_depth_mm : the depth of the penguin's culmen in millimeters.
flipper_length_mm : the length of the penguin's flippers in millimeters.
sex : the sex of the penguin.
The WHERE clause in this query's SELECT statement, WHERE body_mass_g IS
NOT NULL , excludes rows where the body_mass_g column is NULL .
Run the query that creates your linear regression model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, run the following query:
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model`
OPTIONS
( model_type = 'linear_reg' ,
input_label_cols =[ 'body_mass_g' ] ) AS
SELECT
*
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
WHERE
body_mass_g IS NOT NULL ;
It takes about 30 seconds to create the penguins_model model.
To see the model, follow these steps:
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
If you don't see the left pane, click last_page Expand left pane to open the pane.
In the Explorer pane, expand your project and click Datasets .
Click the bqml_tutorial dataset.
Click the Models tab.
BigQuery DataFrames
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart
using BigQuery DataFrames .
For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation .
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see Set
up ADC for a local development environment .
from bigframes.ml.linear_model import LinearRegression
import bigframes.pandas as bpd
# Load data from BigQuery
bq_df = bpd . read_gbq ( "bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins" )
# Drop rows with nulls to get training data
training_data = bq_df . dropna ( subset = [ "body_mass_g" ])
# Specify your feature (or input) columns and the label (or output) column:
feature_columns = training_data . drop ( columns = [ "body_mass_g" ])
label_columns = training_data [[ "body_mass_g" ]]
# Create the linear model
model = LinearRegression ()
model . fit ( feature_columns , label_columns )
model . to_gbq (
your_model_id , # For example: "bqml_tutorial.penguins_model"
replace = True ,
)
It takes about 30 seconds to create the model. To see the model, follow these
steps:
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
In the Explorer pane, expand your project and click Datasets .
Click the bqml_tutorial dataset.
Click the Models tab.
Get training statistics
To see the results of the model training, you can use the
ML.TRAINING_INFO function ,
or you can view the statistics in the Google Cloud console. In this
tutorial, you use the Google Cloud console.
A machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and
attempting to find a model that minimizes loss. This process is called empirical
risk minimization.
Loss is the penalty for a bad prediction. It is a number indicating
how bad the model's prediction was on a single example. If the model's
prediction is perfect, the loss is zero; otherwise, the loss is greater. The
goal of training a model is to find a set of weights and biases that have low
loss, on average, across all examples.
See the model training statistics that were generated when you ran the
CREATE MODEL query:
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
In the Explorer pane, expand your project and click Datasets .
Click the bqml_tutorial dataset.
Click the Models tab.
To open the model information pane, click penguins_model .
Click the Training tab, and then click Table . The results should look
similar to the following:
The Training Data Loss column represents the loss metric calculated
after the model is trained on the training dataset. Since you performed a
linear regression, this column shows the
mean squared error
value. A
normal_equation
optimization strategy is automatically used for this training, so only one
iteration is required to converge to the final model. For more information
on setting the model optimization strategy, see
optimize_strategy .
Evaluate the model
After creating the model, evaluate the model's performance by using the
ML.EVALUATE function
or the
score BigQuery DataFrames function
to evaluate the predicted values generated by the model against the actual data.
SQL
For input, the ML.EVALUATE function takes the trained model and a dataset
that matches the schema of the data that you used to train the model. In
a production environment, you should
evaluate the model on different data than the data you used to train the model.
If you run ML.EVALUATE without providing input data, the function retrieves
the evaluation metrics calculated during training. These metrics are calculated
by using the automatically reserved evaluation dataset:
SELECT
*
FROM
ML . EVALUATE ( MODEL bqml_tutorial . penguins_model );
Run the ML.EVALUATE query:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, run the following query:
SELECT
*
FROM
ML . EVALUATE ( MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model` ,
(
SELECT
*
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
WHERE
body_mass_g IS NOT NULL ));
BigQuery DataFrames
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart
using BigQuery DataFrames .
For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation .
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see Set
up ADC for a local development environment .
import bigframes.pandas as bpd
# Select the model you will be evaluating. `read_gbq_model` loads model data from
# BigQuery, but you could also use the `model` object from the previous steps.
model = bpd . read_gbq_model (
your_model_id , # For example: "bqml_tutorial.penguins_model"
)
# Score the model with input data defined in an earlier step to compare
# model predictions on feature_columns to true labels in label_columns.
score = model . score ( feature_columns , label_columns )
# Expected output results:
# index mean_absolute_error mean_squared_error mean_squared_log_error median_absolute_error r2_score explained_variance
# 0 227.012237 81838.159892 0.00507 173.080816 0.872377 0.872377
# 1 rows x 6 columns
The results should look similar to the following:
Because you performed a linear regression, the results include the following
columns:
mean_absolute_error
mean_squared_error
mean_squared_log_error
median_absolute_error
r2_score
explained_variance
An important metric in the evaluation results is the
R 2 score .
The R 2 score is a statistical measure that determines if the linear
regression predictions approximate the actual data. A value of 0 indicates
that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around the
mean. A value of 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability of
the response data around the mean.
You can also look at the model's information pane in the Google Cloud console
to view the evaluation metrics:
Use the model to predict outcomes
Now that you have evaluated your model, the next step is to use it to predict
an outcome. You can run the
ML.PREDICT function
or the
predict BigQuery DataFrames function
on the model to predict the body mass in grams of all penguins that reside on
the Biscoe Islands.
SQL
For input, the ML.PREDICT function takes the trained model and a dataset that
matches the schema of the data that you used to train the model, excluding the
label column.
Run the ML.PREDICT query:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, run the following query:
SELECT
*
FROM
ML . PREDICT ( MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model` ,
(
SELECT
*
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
WHERE island = 'Biscoe' ));
BigQuery DataFrames
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart
using BigQuery DataFrames .
For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation .
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see Set
up ADC for a local development environment .
# Select the model you'll use for predictions. `read_gbq_model` loads
# model data from BigQuery, but you could also use the `model` object
# object from previous steps.
model = bpd . read_gbq_model (
your_model_id ,
# For example: "bqml_tutorial.penguins_model",
)
# Load data from BigQuery
bq_df = bpd . read_gbq ( "bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins" )
# Use 'contains' function to filter by island containing the string
# "Biscoe".
biscoe_data = bq_df . loc [ bq_df [ "island" ] . str . contains ( "Biscoe" )]
result = model . predict ( biscoe_data )
# Expected output results:
# predicted_body_mass_g species island culmen_length_mm culmen_depth_mm body_mass_g flipper_length_mm sex

# 160 4731.310452 Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) Biscoe 44.5 14.3 216.0 4100.0 <NA>
The results should look similar to the following:
Explain the prediction results
SQL
To understand why the model is generating these prediction results, you can use
the
ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT function .
ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT is an extended version of the ML.PREDICT function.
ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT not only outputs prediction results, but also outputs
additional columns to explain the prediction results. In practice, you can run
ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT instead of ML.PREDICT . For more information, see
BigQuery ML explainable AI overview .
Run the ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT query:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, run the following query:
SELECT
*
FROM
ML . EXPLAIN_PREDICT ( MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model` ,
(
SELECT
*
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
WHERE island = 'Biscoe' ),
STRUCT ( 3 as top_k_features ));
The results should look similar to the following:
Note: The ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT query outputs all the input feature columns,
similar to what ML.PREDICT does. For readability purposes, only one feature
column, species , is shown in the preceding figure.
BigQuery DataFrames

For linear regression models, Shapley values are used to generate feature
attribution values for each feature in the model. The output includes
the top three feature attributions per row of the penguins table because
top_k_features was set to 3 . These attributions are sorted by
the absolute value of the attribution in descending order. In all examples, the
feature sex contributed the most to the overall prediction.
Globally explain the model
SQL
To know which features are generally the most important to determine penguin
weight, you can use the
ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN function .
In order to use ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN , you must retrain the model with the
ENABLE_GLOBAL_EXPLAIN option set to TRUE .
Retrain and get global explanations for the model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, run the following query to retrain the model:
#standardSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model`
OPTIONS (
model_type = 'linear_reg' ,
input_label_cols = [ 'body_mass_g' ] ,
enable_global_explain = TRUE )
AS
SELECT
*
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
WHERE
body_mass_g IS NOT NULL ;
In the query editor, run the following query to get global explanations:
SELECT
