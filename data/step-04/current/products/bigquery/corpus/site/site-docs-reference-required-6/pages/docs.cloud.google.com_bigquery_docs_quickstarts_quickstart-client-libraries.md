libraries.

Before you begin
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Choose whether to
use the BigQuery sandbox at no charge ,
or to
enable billing for your Google Cloud project .
If you do not enable billing for a project, you automatically work in the
BigQuery sandbox. The BigQuery sandbox lets you learn
BigQuery with a limited set of BigQuery
features at no charge. If you do not plan to use your project beyond this
document, we recommend that you use the BigQuery sandbox.
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin, roles/bigquery.jobUser
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Enable the BigQuery API:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable bigquery
For new projects, the BigQuery API is automatically enabled.
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
Activate your Google Cloud project in Cloud Shell:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the project that you selected for
this walkthrough.
The output is similar to the following:
Updated property [core/project].
Query a public dataset
Select one of the following languages:
C#
In Cloud Shell, create a new C# project and file:
dotnet new console -n BigQueryCsharpDemo
The output is similar to the following. Several lines are omitted to
simplify the output.

var client = BigQueryClient . Create ( projectId );
string query = @"SELECT

You have successfully queried a public dataset with the
BigQuery Python client library.
Ruby
In Cloud Shell, create a new Ruby project and file:
mkdir bigquery-ruby-quickstart \
&& touch \
bigquery-ruby-quickstart/app.rb
This command creates a Ruby project that's named
bigquery-ruby-quickstart and a file that's named app.rb .
Open the Cloud Shell Editor:
cloudshell workspace bigquery-ruby-quickstart
To open a terminal in the Cloud Shell Editor, click
Open Terminal .
Open your project directory:
cd bigquery-ruby-quickstart
Install the BigQuery client library for Ruby:
gem install google-cloud-bigquery
The output is similar to the following. Several lines are omitted to
simplify the output.
23 gems installed
Click Open Editor .
In the Explorer pane, locate your BIGQUERY-RUBY-QUICKSTART
project.
Click the app.rb file to open it.
To create a query against the
bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow dataset that returns the
top 10 most viewed Stack Overflow pages and their view counts, copy the
following code into the app.rb file:
require "google/cloud/bigquery"
# This uses Application Default Credentials to authenticate.
# @see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/authentication/getting-started
bigquery = Google :: Cloud :: Bigquery . new
sql = "SELECT " \
"CONCAT('https://stackoverflow.com/questions/', CAST(id as STRING)) as url, view_count " \
"FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` " \
"WHERE tags like '%google-bigquery%' " \
"ORDER BY view_count DESC LIMIT 10"
results = bigquery . query sql
results . each do | row |
puts " #{ row [ :url ] } : #{ row [ :view_count ] } views"
end
Click Open Terminal .
In the terminal, run the app.rb script. If you are prompted to
authorize Cloud Shell and agree to the terms, click
Authorize .
ruby app.rb
The result is similar to the following:

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account, either delete
your Google Cloud project, or delete the resources that you created in
this walkthrough.
Delete the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete the resources
If you used an existing project, delete the resources that you created:
C#
In Cloud Shell, move up a directory:
cd ..
Delete the BigQueryCsharpDemo folder that you created:
rm -R BigQueryCsharpDemo
The -R flag deletes all assets in a folder.
Go
In Cloud Shell, move up a directory:
cd ..
Delete the bigquery-go-quickstart folder that you created:
rm -R bigquery-go-quickstart
The -R flag deletes all assets in a folder.
Java
In Cloud Shell, move up a directory:
cd ..
Delete the bigquery-java-quickstart folder that you created:
rm -R bigquery-java-quickstart
The -R flag deletes all assets in a folder.
Node.js
In Cloud Shell, move up a directory:
cd ..
Delete the bigquery-node-quickstart folder that you created:
rm -R bigquery-node-quickstart
The -R flag deletes all assets in a folder.
PHP
In Cloud Shell, move up a directory:
cd ..
Delete the bigquery-php-quickstart folder that you created:
rm -R bigquery-php-quickstart
The -R flag deletes all assets in a folder.
Python
In Cloud Shell, move up a directory:
cd ..
Delete the bigquery-python-quickstart folder that you created:
rm -R bigquery-python-quickstart
The -R flag deletes all assets in a folder.
