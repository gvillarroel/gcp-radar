Introduction to SQL in BigQuery
This document provides an overview of supported statements and SQL dialects in
BigQuery.
GoogleSQL is an ANSI-compliant
Structured Query Language (SQL)
that includes the following types of supported statements:
Query statements , also
known as Data Query Language (DQL) statements, are the primary method to
analyze data in BigQuery. They scan one or more tables or
expressions and return the computed result rows. Query statements can
include pipe syntax .
Procedural language statements
are procedural extensions to
GoogleSQL that allow you to execute multiple SQL
statements in one request. Procedural statements can use variables and
control-flow statements, and can have side effects.
Data Definition Language (DDL) statements
let you create and modify objects such as the following:
Datasets
Tables, including their schema and column types
Table clones and snapshots
Views
Functions
Indexes
Capacity commitments, reservations, and assignments
Row-level access policies
Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements
enable you to update, insert, and delete data from your
BigQuery tables.
Data Control Language (DCL) statements
let you control BigQuery system resources such as access and
capacity.
Transaction Control Language (TCL) statements
allow you to manage transactions for data modifications.
Load statements
and export statements
to manage data coming in and out of BigQuery.
BigQuery SQL dialects
BigQuery supports the GoogleSQL dialect, which is the
recommended dialect for all new projects. A legacy SQL dialect is also available
with some restrictions . We
recommend that you migrate from legacy SQL to GoogleSQL .
Changing from the default dialect
The interface you use to query your data determines which query dialect is the
default. To switch to a different dialect:
Console
The default dialect for the Google Cloud console is GoogleSQL. To
change the dialect to legacy SQL:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, click the More > Query settings button.
In the Advanced options section, for SQL dialect , click
Legacy , then click Save . This sets the legacy SQL option for this
query. When you click add_box
SQL Query to create a new query, you must select the legacy SQL option
again.
SQL
The default SQL dialect is GoogleSQL.
You can set the SQL dialect by including the prefix
#standardSQL or #legacySQL as part of your query.
These query prefixes are not case-sensitive, must precede the query, and
must be separated from the query by a newline character. The following
example sets the dialect to legacy SQL and queries the natality dataset:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, enter the following statement:
# legacySQL
SELECT
weight_pounds , state , year , gestation_weeks
FROM
[ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ]
ORDER BY
weight_pounds DESC
LIMIT
10 ;
Click play_circle Run .
For more information about how to run queries, see Run an interactive query .
bq
The default query dialect in the bq command-line tool is legacy SQL. To
switch to the GoogleSQL dialect, add the --use_legacy_sql=false or
--nouse_legacy_sql flag to your command-line statement.
Switch to the GoogleSQL dialect
To use GoogleSQL syntax in a query job, set the use_legacy_sql
parameter to false .
bq query \
--use_legacy_sql = false \
'SELECT
word
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`'
Set GoogleSQL as the default dialect
You can set GoogleSQL as the default dialect for the command-line tool and
the interactive shell by editing the command-line tool's configuration file:
.bigqueryrc .
For more information on .bigqueryrc , see
Setting default values for command-specific flags .
To set --use_legacy_sql=false in .bigqueryrc :
Open .bigqueryrc in a text editor. By default, .bigqueryrc should be in
your user directory, for example, $HOME/.bigqueryrc .
Add the following text to the file. This example sets GoogleSQL as the
default syntax for queries and for the mk command (used when you create a
view). If you have already configured default values for query or mk command
flags, you do not need to add [query] or [mk] again.
[query]
--use_legacy_sql = false
[mk]
--use_legacy_sql = false
Save and close the file.
If you are using the interactive shell, you must exit and restart for the changes to be applied.
For information on available command-line flags, see
bq command-line tool reference .
