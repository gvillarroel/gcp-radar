AlloyDB federated queries
As a data analyst, you can query data in AlloyDB for PostgreSQL from BigQuery
using federated queries .
BigQuery AlloyDB federation lets BigQuery
query data residing in AlloyDB in real time without copying or
moving the data.
Before you begin
Ensure that your BigQuery administrator has created an AlloyDB connection and
shared
it with you.
To get the permissions that
you need to query an AlloyDB instance,
ask your administrator to grant you the
BigQuery Connection User ( roles/bigquery.connectionUser )
IAM role on your project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Query data
To send a federated query to AlloyDB from a
GoogleSQL query, use the
EXTERNAL_QUERY function .
Suppose that you store a customer table in BigQuery, while
storing a sales table in AlloyDB, and want to join the two tables in
a single query. The following example makes a federated query to an
AlloyDB table named orders and joins the results with a
BigQuery table named mydataset.customers .
The example query includes 3 parts:
Run the external query SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS
first_order_date FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id in the AlloyDB database
to get the first order date for each customer through
the EXTERNAL_QUERY function.
Join the external query results table with the customers table in
BigQuery by customer_id .
Select customer information and first order date in the final result set.
SELECT c . customer_id , c . name , rq . first_order_date
FROM mydataset . customers AS c
LEFT OUTER JOIN EXTERNAL_QUERY (
'us.connection_id' ,
' '' SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id '' ' ) AS rq ON rq . customer_id = c . customer_id
GROUP BY c . customer_id , c . name , rq . first_order_date ;
View an AlloyDB table schema
You can use the EXTERNAL_QUERY function to query information_schema tables
to access database metadata. For example, you can list all of the tables in the
database or view the table schema. For more information, see PostgreSQL information_schema tables .
-- List all tables in a database.
SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL_QUERY ( "region.connection_id" ,
"select * from information_schema.tables;" );
-- List all columns in a table.
SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL_QUERY ( "region.connection_id" ,
"select * from information_schema.columns where table_name='x';" );
Track BigQuery federated queries
When you run a federated query against AlloyDB,
BigQuery annotates the query with a comment similar to the following:
/* Federated query from BigQuery. Project ID: PROJECT_ID , BigQuery Job ID: JOB_ID . */
If you are monitoring logs for query usage, the following annotation can help you
identify queries coming from BigQuery.
Go to the Logs Explorer page.
Go to the Logs Explorer
In the Query tab, enter the following query:
resource.type="alloydb.googleapis.com/Instance"
textPayload=~"Federated query from BigQuery"
Click Run query .
If there are records available for BigQuery federated queries,
a list of records similar to the following appears in Query results .
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.millis UTC [3210064]: [4-1]
db= DATABASE , user= USER_ACCOUNT
STATEMENT: SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT FROM company_name_table) t;
/* Federated query from BigQuery.
Project ID: PROJECT_ID , BigQuery Job ID: JOB_ID
*/
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.millis UTC [3210532]: [2-1]
db= DATABASE , user= USER_ACCOUNT
STATEMENT: SELECT "company_id", "company type_id" FROM
(SELECT FROM company_name_table) t;
/* Federated query from BigQuery.
Project ID: PROJECT_ID , BigQuery Job ID: JOB_ID
*/

Troubleshooting
This section describes potential errors you might encounter when sending a
federated query to AlloyDB and provides possible troubleshooting
resolutions.
Issue: Failed to connect to the database server with this error:
Invalid table-valued function EXTERNAL_QUERY Connect to PostgreSQL server failed: server closed the connection unexpectedly. This probably means the server terminated abnormally before or while processing the request.
Resolution: Ensure that you used valid credentials and followed all prerequisites
while creating the connection to AlloyDB .
Check if the service account that is automatically created
when a connection to AlloyDB is
created has the AlloyDB Client ( roles/alloydb.client ) role.
For more information, see
Grant access to the service account .
