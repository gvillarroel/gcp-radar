Analyze multimodal data with SQL and BigQuery DataFrames
This tutorial shows you how to
analyze multimodal data by using SQL
queries and
BigQuery DataFrames .
This tutorial uses the product catalog from the public Cymbal pet store dataset.
Objectives
Use
ObjectRef
values to store image data alongside structured data in
a BigQuery
standard table .
Generate text based on image data from a standard table by using the
AI.GENERATE_TABLE function .
Transform existing images to create new images by using a
Python UDF.
Chunk PDFs for further analysis by using a Python UDF.
Use a Gemini model and the AI.GENERATE_TEXT function to analyze the
chunked PDF data.
Generate embeddings based on image data from a standard table by using the
AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING function .
Process ordered multimodal data using arrays of ObjectRef values.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
BigQuery : you incur costs for the data that you
process in BigQuery.
BigQuery Python UDFs : you incur costs for
using Python UDFs.
Cloud Storage : you incur costs for the objects stored
in Cloud Storage.
Vertex AI : you incur costs for calls to
Vertex AI models.
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
For more information about, see the following pricing pages:

Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the BigQuery, BigQuery Connection, Cloud Storage, and Vertex AI APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to complete this tutorial,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Create a connection:
BigQuery Connection Admin ( roles/bigquery.connectionAdmin )
Grant permissions to the connection's service account:
Project IAM Admin ( roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin )
Create a Cloud Storage bucket:
Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin )
Create datasets, models, UDFs, and tables, and run BigQuery jobs:
BigQuery Admin ( roles/bigquery.admin )
Create URLs that let you read and modify Cloud Storage objects:
BigQuery ObjectRef Admin ( roles/bigquery.objectRefAdmin )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .

Create a Python UDF to chunk PDF data
Create a Python UDF to chunk the PDF objects that contain the
Cymbal pets product manuals into multiple parts.
PDFs are often very large and might not fit into a single call to a
generative AI model. By chunking the PDFs, you can store the PDF data in a
model-ready format for easier analysis.
Run the following
to create the chunk_pdf UDF:
SQL
-- This function chunks the product manual PDF into multiple parts.
-- The function accepts an ObjectRefRuntime value for the PDF file and the chunk size.
-- It then parses the PDF, chunks the contents, and returns an array of chunked text.

Generate embeddings and perform a vector search
Generate embeddings from image data, and then use the embeddings to return
similar images by using vector search .
In a production scenario, we recommend creating a
vector index
before running a vector search. A vector
index lets you perform the vector search more quickly, with the trade-off of
reducing recall and so returning more approximate results.
Run the following to create the
products_embeddings table:
SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE cymbal_pets . products_embedding
AS
SELECT product_id , embedding , content as image
FROM AI . GENERATE_EMBEDDING (

Process ordered multimodal data using arrays of ObjectRef values
This section shows you how to complete the following tasks:
Recreate the product_manuals table so that it contains both a PDF file
for the Crittercuisine 5000 product manual, and PDF files for each page
of that manual.
Create a table that maps the manual to its chunks. The ObjectRef value
that represents the complete manual is stored in a
STRUCT<uri STRING, version STRING, authorizer STRING, details JSON>>
column. The ObjectRef values that represent the manual pages are stored
in an
ARRAY<STRUCT<uri STRING, version STRING, authorizer STRING, details JSON>>
column.
Analyze an array of ObjectRef values together to return
a single generated value.
Analyze an array of ObjectRef values separately and
returning a generated value for each array value.
As part of the analysis tasks, you convert the array of ObjectRef values to
an ordered list of
ObjectRefRuntime
values, and then pass that list to a Gemini model, specifying the
ObjectRefRuntime values as part of the prompt. The ObjectRefRuntime values
provide signed URLs that the model uses to access the object information in
Cloud Storage.
Follow these steps to process ordered multimodal data using
arrays of ObjectRef values:
