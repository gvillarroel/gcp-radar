BigQuery Graph and ISO standards
The document describes how BigQuery Graph supports the ISO international
standard query language for graph databases.
BigQuery Graph is based on two ISO standards:
ISO/IEC 9075-16:2023 - Information technology — Database languages SQL Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ) ,
Edition 1, 2023
ISO/IEC 39075:2024 - Information technology — Database languages — GQL ,
Edition 1, 2024
The following tables describe the high-level relationship between SQL/PGQ, GQL,
and how BigQuery Graph supports these standards.
Standard
SQL/PGQ
GQL
BigQuery Graph
Query
Graph pattern matching capabilities
Shares the core Graph Pattern Matching Language (GPML) functionalities with GQL.
Shares the core GPML functionalities with SQL/PGQ.
Both standards are supported. For more information, see BigQuery Graph GQL patterns .
Query
Other query language features (for example, LIMIT , ORDER , aggregation)
SQL-based.
Similar to SQL, but the GQL query features are linearly composable graph query statements.
Both standards are supported. For more information, see BigQuery Graph GQL query statements and Query syntax in GoogleSQL .
Query
Graph and table interoperability
Supported.
Not supported.
Both standards are supported. For more information, see GRAPH_TABLE operator .
Types
Data types, functions and expressions in SQL/PGQ and GQL are similar.
Data types, functions and expressions in SQL/PGQ and GQL are similar.
Supports most data types and expressions in SQL/PGQ and GQL. For more information, see Data types in GoogleSQL .
DML
SQL/PGQ inherits DML from SQL.
Graph-based DML is supported.
Supports SQL table-based DML. For more information, see the GoogleSQL data manipulation language .
Schema
Supports using CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH from tables.
Supports using CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH with open types and closed types.
Supports the SQL/PGQ method. For more information, see the CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH definition.
SQL/PGQ support
Note: G000 is the feature ID from the ISO SQL/PGQ standard.
Standard
SQL/PGQ feature ID
BigQuery Graph
Query (Graph and table interoperability)
Feature G900: GRAPH_TABLE
Supported. For more information, see GRAPH_TABLE operator.
Schema
Feature G924: Explicit key clause for element tables. This implies a claim of conformance to Feature G920: DDL-based SQL-property graphs.
Supported. For more information, see CREATE_PROPERTY_GRAPH statement .
Schema
Feature G925: Explicit label and properties clause for element tables. This implies a claim of conformance to Feature G920: DDL-based SQL-property graphs.
Supported. For more information, see CREATE_PROPERTY_GRAPH statement .
Query (GPML)
Feature G001: Repeatable-elements match mode.
Supported. Repeatable elements match mode is the default semantic. Explicit repeatable elements match mode clause syntax is not supported.
Query (GPML)
Feature G008: Graph pattern WHERE clause. This implies a claim of conformance to Feature G000: Graph pattern.
Supported. For more information, see Graph pattern .
Query (GPML)
Feature G034: Path concatenation.
Supported. For more information, see see Graph pattern .
Query (GPML)
Feature G040: Vertex pattern.
Supported. For more information, see Element pattern .
Query (GPML)
Feature G042: Basic full edge patterns.
Supported. For more information, see Element pattern .
Query (GPML)
Feature G070: Label expression: label disjunction.
Supported. For more information, see Label expression .
Query (GPML)
Feature G073: Label expression: individual label name.
Supported. For more information, see Label expression .
Query (GPML)
Feature G090: Property reference.
Supported.
GQL support
Note: GG00 is the feature ID from the ISO GQL standard.
Standard
GQL feature ID
BigQuery Graph
Schema
Feature GG02: Graph with a closed graph type. Conformance with at least one of GG20, GG21, GG22, or GG23: Feature GG20: Explicit element type names.
Feature GG21: Explicit element type key label sets.
Feature GG22: Element type key label set inference.
Feature GG22: Element type key label set inference.
Feature GG23 Optional element type key label sets.
Supported. GQL support can be chosen from GG01: Graph with an open type or GG02. BigQuery Graph doesn't support the exact same CREATE_GRAPH_TYPE statement as GQL. However, the CREATE_PROPERTY_GRAPH statement supported by BigQuery Graph is closely related to GG02 (with similar support for GG20, GG21, GG22, and GG23).
Lexical structure
"A claim of conformance to a specific version of TheUnicode® Standard and the synchronous versions of Unicode Technical Standard #10, Unicode Standard Annex #15, and Unicode Standard Annex #31. The claimed version of The Unicode® Standard shall not be less than 13.0.0."
BigQuery Graph GQL shares the exact lexical structure with GoogleSQL. For reference to unicode escape values, see Escape sequences for string and bytes literals .
Data types
"A claim of conformance to the set of all value types that are supported as the types of property values. At minimum, this set shall include: The character string type specified by STRING or VARCHAR .
The boolean type specified by BOOLEAN or BOOL .
The signed regular integer type specified by SIGNED INTEGER , INTEGER , or INT .
The approximate numeric type specified by FLOAT ."
Supported. For more information, see a full list of data types supported by BigQuery Graph GQL.
Additional features
The features listed in the previous sections are the minimal conformance
features of the standards. BigQuery Graph supports additional features
in the ISO standards. To learn more, see
BigQuery Graph schema overview
and GQL overview .
