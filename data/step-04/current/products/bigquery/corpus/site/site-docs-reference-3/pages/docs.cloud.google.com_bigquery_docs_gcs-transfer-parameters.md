Runtime parameters in Cloud Storage transfers
When you set up a data transfer in Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), you can parameterize the URI (or data path) and the destination
table. Parameterizing lets you load data from buckets that are organized by
date. These parameters are referred to as runtime parameters to distinguish
them from query parameters.
When you use runtime parameters in a transfer, you can do the following:
Specify how you want to partition the destination table
Retrieve files that match a particular date
Available runtime parameters
When you set up the Cloud Storage, Blob Storage, or
Amazon S3 transfer, you can specify how you want to partition the
destination table by using runtime parameters.
Parameter
Template type
Value
run_time
Formatted timestamp
In UTC time, per the schedule. For regularly scheduled transfers, run_time represents the intended time of execution. For example, if the transfer is set to "every 24 hours", the run_time difference between two consecutive queries will be exactly 24 hours—even though the actual execution time might vary slightly. See TransferRun.runTime
run_date
Date string
The date of the run_time parameter in the following format: %Y%m%d ; for example, 20180101 . This format is compatible with ingestion-time partitioned tables.
Templating system
Cloud Storage, Blob Storage, and Amazon S3 transfers
support runtime parameters in the destination table name by using a templating
syntax.
Parameter templating syntax
The templating syntax supports basic string templating and time offsetting. Parameters are
referenced in the following formats:
{run_date}
{run_time[+\-offset]|"time_format"}
Parameter
Purpose
run_date
This parameter is replaced by the date in format YYYYMMDD .
run_time
This parameter supports the following properties:
offset
Time offset expressed in hours (h), minutes (m), and seconds (s) in that order.
Days (d) are not supported.
Decimals are allowed, for example: 1.5h .
time_format
A formatting string. The most common formatting parameters are years (%Y), months
(%m), and days (%d).
For partitioned tables, YYYYMMDD is the required suffix - this is equivalent to "%Y%m%d".
Read more about
formatting datetime elements .
Usage notes:
No whitespace is allowed between run_time, offset, and time format.
To include literal curly braces in the string, you can escape them as '\{' and '\}' .
To include literal quotes or a vertical bar in the time_format, such as
"YYYY|MM|DD" , you can escape them in the format string as: '\"' or
'\|' .
Parameter templating examples
These examples demonstrate specifying destination table names with different time formats, and
offsetting the run time.

20180215_mytable_000137
Note: When you use date or time parameters to create tables with names ending in a date
format such as YYYYMMDD , BigQuery groups these tables together . In
the Google Cloud console, these grouped tables might be displayed with a name like
mytable_(1) , which represents the collection of sharded tables.
Partitioning options
There are two types of partitioned tables in BigQuery:
Tables that are partitioned by ingestion time.
For Cloud Storage, Blob Storage, and
Amazon S3 transfers, the ingestion time is the transfer's run time.
Tables that are partitioned based on a column. The
column type must be a
TIMESTAMP
or DATE
column.
If the destination table is partitioned on a column, you identify the
partitioning column when you create the destination table and specify its
schema. Learn more about creating column-based partitioned tables in
Creating and using partitioned tables .
Note: Minutes cannot be specified when partitioning a table.
Partitioning examples
Table with no partitioning
Destination table: mytable
Ingestion-time partitioned table
Destination table: mytable $YYYYMMDD
Note that minutes cannot be specified.
Column-partitioned table
Destination table: mytable
Specify the partitioning column as a TIMESTAMP or
DATE column when you create the table's schema.
Notes on parameter usage
If you partition your data based on your local timezone, you need to
manually calculate the hour offset from UTC by using the offsetting mechanism
in the templating syntax .
Minutes cannot be specified in parameters.
Using wildcards for the URI or data path in combination with parameters
on the destination table name is allowed.
Runtime parameter examples
The following examples show ways to combine the wildcard character and
parameters for common use cases. Assume the table's name is mytable and
the run_time is 2018-02-15 00:00:00 (UTC) for all examples.
Transfer data to a non-partitioned table
This use case applies to loading new files from a Cloud Storage,
Blob Storage, or Amazon S3 bucket into a non-partitioned
table. This example uses a wildcard in the URI or data path and uses an ad hoc
refresh transfer to pick up new files.
Data source
Source URI or data path
Destination table name
Cloud Storage
gs://bucket/*.csv
mytable
Amazon S3
s3://bucket/*.csv
mytable
Blob Storage
*.csv
mytable
Load a snapshot of all data into an ingestion-time partitioned table
In this case, all data in the specified URI or data path is transferred to a
table partitioned by today's date. In a refresh transfer, this configuration
picks up files added since the last load and adds them to a particular
partition.
Data source
Source URI or data path
Parameterized destination table name
Evaluated destination table name
Cloud Storage
gs://bucket/*.csv
mytable${ run_time|"%Y%m%d" }
mytable$20180215
Amazon S3
s3://bucket/*.csv
mytable${ run_time|"%Y%m%d" }
mytable$20180215
Blob Storage
*.csv
mytable${ run_time|"%Y%m%d" }
mytable$20180215
This use case transfers today's data into a table partitioned on today's date.
This example also applies to a refresh transfer that retrieves newly added files
that match a certain date and loads the data into the corresponding partition.
