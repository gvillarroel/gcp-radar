Deploy and apply a remote function using BigQuery DataFrames
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Use the BigQuery DataFrames API to deploy a Python function as a Cloud Function and use it as a remote function.
Code sample
Python
Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the
BigQuery quickstart using
client libraries .
For more information, see the
BigQuery Python API
reference documentation .
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see
Set up authentication for client libraries .
import bigframes.pandas as bpd
# Set BigQuery DataFrames options
bpd . options . bigquery . project = your_gcp_project_id
bpd . options . bigquery . location = "US"
# BigQuery DataFrames gives you the ability to turn your custom scalar
# functions into a BigQuery remote function. It requires the GCP project to
# be set up appropriately and the user having sufficient privileges to use
# them. One can find more details about the usage and the requirements via
# `help` command.
help ( bpd . remote_function )
# Read a table and inspect the column of interest.
df = bpd . read_gbq ( "bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins" )
df [ "body_mass_g" ] . head ( 10 )
# Define a custom function, and specify the intent to turn it into a remote
# function. It requires a BigQuery connection. If the connection is not
# already created, BigQuery DataFrames will attempt to create one assuming
# the necessary APIs and IAM permissions are setup in the project. In our
# examples we will be letting the default connection `bigframes-default-connection`
# be used. We will also set `reuse=False` to make sure we don't
# step over someone else creating remote function in the same project from
# the exact same source code at the same time. Let's try a `pandas`-like use
# case in which we want to apply a user defined scalar function to every
# value in a `Series`, more specifically bucketize the `body_mass_g` value
# of the penguins, which is a real number, into a category, which is a
# string.
@bpd . remote_function (
reuse = False ,
cloud_function_service_account = "default" ,
)
def get_bucket ( num : float ) - > str :
if not num :
return "NA"
boundary = 4000
return "at_or_above_4000" if num > = boundary else "below_4000"
# Then we can apply the remote function on the `Series` of interest via
# `apply` API and store the result in a new column in the DataFrame.
df = df . assign ( body_mass_bucket = df [ "body_mass_g" ] . apply ( get_bucket ))
# This will add a new column `body_mass_bucket` in the DataFrame. You can
# preview the original value and the bucketized value side by side.
df [[ "body_mass_g" , "body_mass_bucket" ]] . head ( 10 )
# The above operation was possible by doing all the computation on the
# cloud. For that, there is a google cloud function deployed by serializing
# the user code, and a BigQuery remote function created to call the cloud
# function via the latter's http endpoint on the data in the DataFrame.
# The BigQuery remote function created to support the BigQuery DataFrames
# remote function can be located via a property `bigframes_remote_function`
# set in the remote function object.
print ( f "Created BQ remote function: { get_bucket . bigframes_remote_function } " )
# The cloud function can be located via another property
# `bigframes_cloud_function` set in the remote function object.
print ( f "Created cloud function: { get_bucket . bigframes_cloud_function } " )
# Warning: The deployed cloud function may be visible to other users with
# sufficient privilege in the project, so the user should be careful about
# having any sensitive data in the code that will be deployed as a remote
# function.
# Let's continue trying other potential use cases of remote functions. Let's
# say we consider the `species`, `island` and `sex` of the penguins
# sensitive information and want to redact that by replacing with their hash
# code instead. Let's define another scalar custom function and decorate it
# as a remote function. The custom function in this example has external
# package dependency, which can be specified via `packages` parameter.
@bpd . remote_function (
reuse = False ,
packages = [ "cryptography" ],
cloud_function_service_account = "default" ,
)
def get_hash ( input : str ) - > str :
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
# handle missing value
if input is None :
input = ""
key = Fernet . generate_key ()
f = Fernet ( key )
return f . encrypt ( input . encode ()) . decode ()
# We can use this remote function in another `pandas`-like API `map` that
# can be applied on a DataFrame
df_redacted = df [[ "species" , "island" , "sex" ]] . map ( get_hash )
df_redacted . head ( 10 )
