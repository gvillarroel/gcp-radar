Perform classification with a boosted trees model
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial teaches you how to use a
boosted trees classifier model
to predict the income range of individuals based on their demographic data.
The model predicts whether a value falls into one of two categories, in this
case whether an individual's annual income falls above or below $50,000.
This tutorial uses the
bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.census_adult_income
dataset. This dataset contains the demographic and income information of US
residents from 2000 and 2010.
Objectives
This tutorial guides you through completing the following tasks:
Creating a boosted trees model to predict census respondents' income bracket
by using the
CREATE MODEL statement .
Evaluating the model by using the
ML.EVALUATE function .
Getting predictions from the model by using the
ML.PREDICT function .
Costs

API
Call the datasets.insert
method with a defined dataset resource .
{
"datasetReference" : {
"datasetId" : "bqml_tutorial"
}
}
BigQuery DataFrames
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart
using BigQuery DataFrames .
For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation .
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see Set
up ADC for a local development environment .
import google.cloud.bigquery
bqclient = google . cloud . bigquery . Client ()
bqclient . create_dataset ( "bqml_tutorial" , exists_ok = True )
Prepare the sample data
The model you create in this tutorial predicts the income bracket for census
respondents, based on the following features:
Age
Type of work performed
Marital status
Level of education
Occupation
Hours worked per week
The education column isn't included in the training data, because
the education and education_num columns both express the respondent's level
of education in different formats.
You separate the data into training, evaluation, and prediction sets by creating
a new dataframe column that is derived from the functional_weight column.
Eighty percent of the data is used for training the model, and the remaining
twenty percent of the data is used for evaluation and prediction.
SQL
To prepare your sample data, create a view to
contain the training data. This view is used by the CREATE MODEL statement
later in this tutorial.
Run the query that prepares the sample data:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, run the following query:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
`bqml_tutorial.input_data` AS
SELECT
age ,
workclass ,
marital_status ,
education_num ,
occupation ,
hours_per_week ,
income_bracket ,
CASE
WHEN MOD ( functional_weight , 10 ) 8 THEN 'training'
WHEN MOD ( functional_weight , 10 ) = 8 THEN 'evaluation'
WHEN MOD ( functional_weight , 10 ) = 9 THEN 'prediction'
END AS dataframe
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.census_adult_income` ;
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
If you don't see the left pane, click last_page Expand left pane to open the pane.
In the Explorer pane, search for the bqml_tutorial dataset.
Click the dataset, and then click Overview > Tables .
Click the input_data view to open the information pane. The view
schema appears in the Schema tab.
BigQuery DataFrames
Create a DataFrame called input_data . You use input_data later in this tutorial to use to train the model, evaluate it, and make predictions.
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart
using BigQuery DataFrames .
For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation .
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see Set
up ADC for a local development environment .
import bigframes.pandas as bpd
input_data = bpd . read_gbq (
"bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.census_adult_income" ,
columns = (
"age" ,
"workclass" ,
"marital_status" ,
"education_num" ,
"occupation" ,
"hours_per_week" ,
"income_bracket" ,
"functional_weight" ,
),
)
input_data [ "dataframe" ] = bpd . Series ( "training" , index = input_data . index ,) . case_when (
[
((( input_data [ "functional_weight" ] % 10 ) == 8 ), "evaluation" ),
((( input_data [ "functional_weight" ] % 10 ) == 9 ), "prediction" ),
]
)
del input_data [ "functional_weight" ]
Create the boosted trees model
Create a boosted trees model to predict census respondents' income bracket, and
train it on the census data. The query takes about 30 minutes to complete.
SQL
Follow these steps to create the model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
CREATE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.tree_model`
OPTIONS ( MODEL_TYPE = 'BOOSTED_TREE_CLASSIFIER' ,
BOOSTER_TYPE = 'GBTREE' ,
NUM_PARALLEL_TREE = 1 ,
MAX_ITERATIONS = 50 ,
TREE_METHOD = 'HIST' ,
EARLY_STOP = FALSE ,
SUBSAMPLE = 0.85 ,
INPUT_LABEL_COLS = [ 'income_bracket' ] )
AS SELECT * EXCEPT ( dataframe )
FROM `bqml_tutorial.input_data`
WHERE dataframe = 'training' ;
After the query completes, the
tree_model model can be accessed through the Explorer pane. Because
the query uses a CREATE MODEL statement to create a model, you don't see
query results.
BigQuery DataFrames
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart
using BigQuery DataFrames .
For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation .
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see Set
up ADC for a local development environment .
from bigframes.ml import ensemble
# input_data is defined in an earlier step.
training_data = input_data [ input_data [ "dataframe" ] == "training" ]
X = training_data . drop ( columns = [ "income_bracket" , "dataframe" ])
y = training_data [ "income_bracket" ]
# create and train the model
tree_model = ensemble . XGBClassifier (
n_estimators = 1 ,
booster = "gbtree" ,
tree_method = "hist" ,
max_iterations = 1 , # For a more accurate model, try 50 iterations.
subsample = 0.85 ,
)
tree_model . fit ( X , y )
tree_model . to_gbq (
your_model_id , # For example: "your-project.bqml_tutorial.tree_model"
replace = True ,
)
Evaluate the model
SQL
Follow these steps to evaluate the model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
SELECT
*
FROM
ML . EVALUATE ( MODEL `bqml_tutorial.tree_model` ,
(
SELECT
*
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.input_data`
WHERE
dataframe = 'evaluation'
)
);
The results should look similar to the following:
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| precision | recall | accuracy | f1_score | log_loss | roc_auc |
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------+

X = evaluation_data . drop ( columns = [ "income_bracket" , "dataframe" ])
y = evaluation_data [ "income_bracket" ]
# The score() method evaluates how the model performs compared to the
# actual data. Output DataFrame matches that of ML.EVALUATE().
score = tree_model . score ( X , y )
score . peek ()
# Output:
# precision recall accuracy f1_score log_loss roc_auc
# 0 0.671924 0.578804 0.839429 0.621897 0.344054 0.887335
The evaluation metrics indicate good model performance, in particular,
the fact that the
roc_auc score is greater than 0.8 .
For more information about the evaluation metrics, see
Output .
Use the model to predict classifications
SQL
Follow these steps to forecast data with the model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
You can delete the project you created.
Or you can keep the project and delete the dataset.
Delete your dataset
Deleting your project removes all datasets and all tables in the project. If you
prefer to reuse the project, you can delete the dataset you created in this
tutorial:
If necessary, open the BigQuery page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to the BigQuery page
In the navigation, click the bqml_tutorial dataset you created.
Click Delete dataset on the right side of the window.
This action deletes the dataset, the table, and all the data.
In the Delete dataset dialog, confirm the delete command by typing
the name of your dataset ( bqml_tutorial ) and then click Delete .
Delete your project
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
