Improve model performance with hyperparameter tuning
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial teaches you how to use
hyperparameter tuning in
BigQuery ML to tune a machine learning model and improve its
performance.
You perform hyperparameter tuning by specifying the
NUM_TRIALS option
of the CREATE MODEL statement, in combination with other model-specific
options. When you set these options, BigQuery ML trains
multiple versions, or trials of the model, each with slightly different
parameters, and returns the trial that performs the best.
This tutorial uses the public
tlc_yellow_trips_2018 sample table , which contains information about taxi trips in New York City
in 2018.
Objectives
This tutorial guides you through completing the following tasks:
Using the
CREATE MODEL statement
to create a baseline linear regression model.
Evaluating the baseline model by using the
ML.EVALUATE function .
Using the CREATE MODEL statement with hyperparameter tuning options to
train twenty trials of a linear regression model.
Reviewing the trials by using the
ML.TRIAL_INFO function .
Evaluating the trials by using the ML.EVALUATE function.
Get predictions about taxi trips from the optimal model among the trials by
using the
ML.PREDICT function .

Follow these steps to create the table:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `bqml_tutorial.taxi_tip_input`
AS
SELECT * EXCEPT ( tip_amount ), tip_amount AS label
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2018`
WHERE
tip_amount IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100000 ;
Create a baseline linear regression model
Create a linear regression model without hyperparameter tuning and train it on
the taxi_tip_input table data.
Follow these steps to create the model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.baseline_taxi_tip_model`
OPTIONS (
MODEL_TYPE = 'LINEAR_REG'
)
AS
SELECT
*
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.taxi_tip_input` ;
The query takes about 2 minutes to complete.
Evaluate the baseline model
Evaluate the performance of the model by using the ML.EVALUATE function.
The ML.EVALUATE function evaluates the predicted content ratings returned by
the model against the evaluation metrics calculated during model training.
Follow these steps to evaluate the model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
SELECT *
FROM
ML . EVALUATE ( MODEL `bqml_tutorial.baseline_taxi_tip_model` );
The results look similar to the following:
+---------------------+--------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| mean_absolute_error | mean_squared_error | mean_squared_log_error | median_absolute_error | r2_score | explained_variance |
+---------------------+--------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| 2.5853895559690323 | 23760.416358496139 | 0.017392406523370374 | 0.0044248227819481123 | -1934.5450533482465 | -1934.3513857946277 |
+---------------------+--------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
The r2_score value for the baseline model is negative, which indicates a
poor fit for the data; the closer the
R 2 score
is to 1, the better the model fit is.
Create a linear regression model with hyperparameter tuning
Create a linear regression model with hyperparameter tuning and train it on
the taxi_tip_input table data.
You use the following hyperparameter tuning options in the CREATE MODEL
statement:
The
NUM_TRIALS option
to set the number of trials to twenty.
The
MAX_PARALLEL_TRIALS option
to run two trials in each training job, for a total of ten jobs and twenty
trials. This reduces the training time needed. However, the two concurrent
trials don't benefit from each other's training results.
The
L1_REG option
to try different L1 regularization values in the different trials.
L1 regularization removes irrelevant features from the model, which
helps prevent
overfitting .
The other hyperparameter tuning options supported by the model use their default
values, as follows:
L1_REG : 0
HPARAM_TUNING_ALGORITHM : 'VIZIER_DEFAULT'
HPARAM_TUNING_OBJECTIVES : ['R2_SCORE']
Follow these steps to create the model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.hp_taxi_tip_model`
OPTIONS (
MODEL_TYPE = 'LINEAR_REG' ,
NUM_TRIALS = 20 ,
MAX_PARALLEL_TRIALS = 2 ,
L1_REG = HPARAM_RANGE ( 0 , 5 ))
AS
SELECT
*
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.taxi_tip_input` ;
The query takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.
Get information about the training trials
Get information about all of the trials, including their hyperparameter values,
objectives, and status, by using the ML.TRIAL_INFO function. This function
also returns information about which trial has the best performance, based on
this information.
Follow these steps to get trial information:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
SELECT *
FROM
ML . TRIAL_INFO ( MODEL `bqml_tutorial.hp_taxi_tip_model` )
