PROJECT_OPTIONS_CHANGES view
You can query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROJECT_OPTIONS_CHANGES view to retrieve
real-time metadata about BigQuery configuration changes of a project.
This view reflects project-level configuration changes
made after January 31, 2024.
Required permissions
To get the configuration, you need the bigquery.config.update
Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission at the project level. The predefined
IAM role roles/bigquery.admin includes the permissions that you
need to create a configuration.
For more information about granular BigQuery permissions, see
roles and permissions .
Schema
When you query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROJECT_OPTIONS_CHANGES view, the query
results contain one row for each configuration change in a project.
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROJECT_OPTIONS_CHANGES view has the following schema:
Column name
Data type
Value
update_time
TIMESTAMP
The time the configuration change occurred.
username
STRING
For first-party users, it's their user email. For third-party users, it's
the name that users set in the third-party identity provider.
updated_options
JSON
A JSON object of the configuration options users updated in the
change, containing the previous and the new values of updated fields.
project_id
STRING
The project ID. This field is empty for organization-level
configuration changes.
project_number
INTEGER
The project number. This field is empty for the organization-level
configuration changes.
For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of
using a wildcard ( SELECT * ). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from
breaking if the underlying schema changes.
Data retention
This view contains sessions that are running and the history of sessions
completed in the past 180 days.
Scope and syntax
Queries against this view must have a region qualifier .
View name
Resource scope
Region scope
`region- REGION `.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROJECT_OPTIONS_CHANGES
Configuration changes within the specified project.
REGION
Replace the following:
REGION : any dataset region name . For example, US , or us-west2 .
Note: To learn how to extract a JSON scalar value from the updated_options
column and convert it to a SQL STRING value such as JSON_VALUE() , see
JSON functions .
Examples
The following example retrieves all columns from the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROJECT_OPTIONS_CHANGES view.
SELECT
*
FROM
`region- REGION ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . PROJECT_OPTIONS_CHANGES ;
Note: INFORMATION_SCHEMA view names are case-sensitive.
The result is similar to the following:
+----------------+------------+-------------------------+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
