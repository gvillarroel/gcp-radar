SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION view
BigQuery search indexes provide free
index management until your organization reaches the
limit in a given region. You can use the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION view to understand your
current consumption towards that limit, broken down by projects and tables. The
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION view contains one row for
each search index for the whole organization associated with the current project.
Note: The data in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION view
isn't kept in real time, and might be delayed by a few seconds to a few minutes.
Required permissions
To query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION view, you need
the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for your organization:
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.list
Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the preceding
permissions:
roles/bigquery.admin
roles/bigquery.dataViewer
roles/bigquery.dataEditor
roles/bigquery.metadataViewer
This schema view is only available to users with defined
Google Cloud organizations .
For more information about BigQuery permissions, see
Access control with IAM .
Schema
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION view has the following
schema:
Column name
Data type
Value
project_id
STRING
The name of the project that contains the dataset.
project_number
STRING
The project number that contains the dataset.
index_catalog
STRING
The name of the project that contains the dataset.
index_schema
STRING
The name of the dataset that contains the index.
table_name
STRING
The name of the base table that the index is created on.
index_name
STRING
The name of the search index.
index_status
STRING
The status of the index can be one of the following:
ACTIVE : the index is usable or being created.
PENDING DISABLEMENT : the total size of indexed base tables exceeds your organization's limit ; the index is queued for deletion. While in this state, the index is usable in search queries and you are charged for the search index storage.
TEMPORARILY DISABLED : either the total size of indexed base tables exceeds your organization's limit , or the base indexed table is smaller than 10 GB. While in this state, the index is not used in search queries and you are not charged for the search index storage.
PERMANENTLY DISABLED : there is an incompatible schema change on the base table, such as changing the type of an indexed column from STRING to INT64 .
index_status_details
RECORD
The record contains following fields:
throttle_status : indicates the throttle status of the search index, possible values are as follows:
UNTHROTTLED : the index is usable.
BASE_TABLE_TOO_SMALL : the base table size is smaller than 10 GB. This limit applies whether or not you use your own reservation for your index-management jobs. In this case, the index is temporarily disabled and search queries don't use the index.
BASE_TABLE_TOO_LARGE : the base table size exceeds your organization's limit .
ORGANIZATION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED : the total size of indexed base tables in your organization exceeds your organization's limit .
message : detailed message that describes the index status.
use_background_reservation
BOOL
Indicates whether the index maintenance uses the BACKGROUND reservation. This is set to FALSE when the index maintenance uses the limit.
For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of
using a wildcard ( SELECT * ). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from
breaking if the underlying schema changes.
Scope and syntax
Queries against this view must include a region qualifier .
The following table explains the region scope for this view:
View name
Resource scope
Region scope
[` PROJECT_ID `.]`region- REGION `.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION
Organization that contains the specified project
REGION
Replace the following:
Optional: PROJECT_ID : the ID of your
Google Cloud project. If not specified, the default project is used.
REGION : the region for
your project. For example, `myproject`.`region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION .
Note: You must use a region qualifier
to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. The location of the query
execution must match the region of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA view.
Index throttling
If an index is throttled, its table size is not counted towards your
organization's limit. This throttling occurs when the base table size falls
under 10 GB or exceeds your organization's
limit . When an index is throttled,
its management jobs are paused, causing the index to become stale and
eventually temporarily disabled. Consequently, search queries are unable to use
the index.
You can set up alerts to get notified when a certain threshold is exceeded,
similar to setting up alerts for scheduled queries .
For example, set up an alert when the table size exceeds 70% of the quota limit,
so that you have time to act.
Examples
This section includes example queries of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION view.
Find if the consumption exceeds the limit in a given region
The following example illustrates if the total indexed base table size across an
organization, utilizing shared slots within the US multi-region, exceeds 100 TB:
WITH
indexed_base_table_size AS (
SELECT
SUM ( base_table . total_logical_bytes ) AS total_logical_bytes
FROM
` region - us ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION AS search_index
JOIN
` region - us ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TABLE_STORAGE_BY_ORGANIZATION AS base_table
ON
( search_index . table_name = base_table . table_name
AND search_index . project_id = base_table . project_id
AND search_index . index_schema = base_table . table_schema )
WHERE
TRUE
-- Excludes search indexes that are permanently disabled.
AND search_index . index_status != 'PERMANENTLY DISABLED'
-- Excludes BASE_TABLE_TOO_SMALL search indexes whose base table size is
-- less than 10 GB. These tables don't count toward the limit.
AND search_index . index_status_details . throttle_status != 'BASE_TABLE_TOO_SMALL'
-- Excludes search indexes whose project has BACKGROUND reservation purchased
-- for search indexes.
AND search_index . use_background_reservation = false
-- Outputs the total indexed base table size if it exceeds 100 TB,
-- otherwise, doesn't return any output.
)
SELECT * FROM indexed_base_table_size
WHERE total_logical_bytes >= 109951162777600 -- 100 TB
The result is similar to the following:
+---------------------+
| total_logical_bytes |
+---------------------+
| 109951162777601 |
+---------------------+
Find total indexed base table size by projects in a region
The following example gives the breakdown on each project in a US multi-region
with the total size of indexed base tables:
SELECT
search_index . project_id ,
search_index . use_background_reservation ,
SUM ( base_table . total_logical_bytes ) AS total_logical_bytes
FROM
` region - us ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION AS search_index
JOIN
` region - us ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TABLE_STORAGE_BY_ORGANIZATION AS base_table
ON
( search_index . table_name = base_table . table_name
AND search_index . project_id = base_table . project_id
AND search_index . index_schema = base_table . table_schema )
WHERE
TRUE
-- Excludes search indexes that are permanently disabled.
AND search_index . index_status != 'PERMANENTLY DISABLED'
-- Excludes BASE_TABLE_TOO_SMALL search indexes whose base table size is
-- less than 10 GB. These tables don't count toward limit.
AND search_index . index_status_details . throttle_status != 'BASE_TABLE_TOO_SMALL'
GROUP BY search_index . project_id , search_index . use_background_reservation
The result is similar to the following:
+---------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+
| project_id | use_background_reservation | total_logical_bytes |
+---------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+
| projecta | true | 971329178274633 |
+---------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+
| projectb | false | 834638211024843 |
+---------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+
| projectc | false | 562910385625126 |
+---------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+
Find throttled search indexes
This following example returns all search indexes that are throttled within the
organization and region:
SELECT project_id , index_schema , table_name , index_name
FROM
` region - us ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . SEARCH_INDEXES_BY_ORGANIZATION
WHERE
-- Excludes search indexes that are permanently disabled.
index_status != 'PERMANENTLY DISABLED'
AND index_status_details . throttle_status IN ( 'ORGANIZATION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED' , 'BASE_TABLE_TOO_LARGE' )
The result is similar to the following:
+--------------------+--------------------+---------------+----------------+
| project_id | index_schema | table_name | index_name |
+--------------------+--------------------+---------------+----------------+
| projecta | dataset_us | table1 | index1 |
| projectb | dataset_us | table1 | index1 |
+--------------------+--------------------+---------------+----------------+
