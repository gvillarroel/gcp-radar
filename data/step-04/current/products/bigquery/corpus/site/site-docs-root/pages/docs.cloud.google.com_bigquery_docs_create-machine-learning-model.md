Create a machine learning model in BigQuery ML by using SQL
This tutorial shows you how to create a logistic regression model by using
BigQuery ML SQL queries.
BigQuery ML lets you create and train machine learning models in
BigQuery by using SQL queries. This helps make machine learning more
approachable by letting you use familiar tools like the BigQuery
SQL editor, and also increases development speed by removing the need to move
data into a separate machine learning environment.
In this tutorial, you use the sample
Google Analytics sample dataset for BigQuery
to create a model that predicts whether a website visitor will make a
transaction. For information on the schema of the Analytics dataset, see
BigQuery export schema
in the Analytics Help Center.
To learn how to create models by using the Google Cloud console user interface, see
work with models by using a UI .
Objectives
This tutorial shows you how to perform the following tasks:
Using the
CREATE MODEL statement
to create a binary logistic regression model.
Using the
ML.EVALUATE function
to evaluate the model.
Using the
ML.PREDICT function
to make predictions by using the model.

Create a logistic regression model
Create a logistic regression model using the Analytics sample
dataset for BigQuery.
SQL
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, run the following statement:
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.sample_model`
OPTIONS ( model_type = 'logistic_reg' ) AS
SELECT
IF ( totals . transactions IS NULL , 0 , 1 ) AS label ,
IFNULL ( device . operatingSystem , "" ) AS os ,
device . isMobile AS is_mobile ,
IFNULL ( geoNetwork . country , "" ) AS country ,
IFNULL ( totals . pageviews , 0 ) AS pageviews
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170630'
The query takes several minutes to complete. After the first iteration is
complete, your model ( sample_model ) appears in the navigation panel.
Because the query uses a CREATE MODEL statement to create a model, you don't
see query results.
Query details
The CREATE MODEL statement creates the model and then trains the model
using the data retrieved by your query's SELECT statement.
The OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') clause creates a logistic
regression model. A
logistic regression model splits input data into two classes, and then
estimates the probability that the data is in one of the classes. What you are
trying to detect, such as whether an email is spam, is represented by 1 and
other values are represented by 0. The likelihood of a given value belonging
to the class you are trying to detect is indicated by a value between 0 and 1.
For example, if an email receives a probability estimate of 0.9, then there is
a 90% probability that the email is spam.
This query's SELECT statement retrieves the following columns that are used
by the model to predict the probability that a customer will complete a
transaction:
totals.transactions : the total number of ecommerce transactions
within the session. If the number of transactions is NULL , the value in the
label column is set to 0 . Otherwise, it is set to 1 . These values
represent the possible outcomes. Creating an alias named label is an
alternative to setting the input_label_cols= option in the CREATE MODEL
statement.
device.operatingSystem : the operating system of the visitor's device.
device.isMobile — Indicates whether the visitor's device is a mobile
device.
geoNetwork.country : the country from which the sessions originated,
based on the IP address.
totals.pageviews : the total number of page views within the session.
The FROM clause — causes the query to train the model by using the
bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions sample tables.
These tables are sharded by date, so you aggregate them by using a wildcard in
the table name: google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_* .
The WHERE clause — _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170630'
— limits the number of tables scanned by the query. The date range
scanned is August 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017.

View the model's loss statistics
Machine learning is about creating a model that can use data to make a
prediction. The model is essentially a function that takes inputs and applies
calculations to the inputs to produce an output — a prediction.
Machine learning algorithms work by taking several examples where the
prediction is already known (such as the historical data of user purchases) and
iteratively adjusting various weights in the model so that the model's
predictions match the true values. It does this by minimizing how wrong the
model is using a metric called loss.
The expectation is that for each iteration, the loss should be decreasing,
ideally to zero. A loss of zero means the model is 100% accurate.
When training the model, BigQuery ML automatically splits the
input data into
training and evaluation sets ,
in order to avoid overfitting
the model. This is necessary so that the training algorithm doesn't fit itself
so closely to the training data that it can't generalize to new examples.
Use the Google Cloud console to see how the model's loss changes over the
model's training iterations:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
If you don't see the left pane, click last_page Expand left pane to open the pane.
In the Explorer pane, expand your project, click Datasets ,
and then click the bqml_tutorial dataset.
Click the Models tab, and then click the sample_model model.
Click the Training tab and look at the Loss graph. The Loss
graph shows the change in the loss metric over the iterations on the
training dataset. If you hold your cursor over the graph, you can see that
there are lines for Training loss and Evaluation loss . Since you
performed a logistic regression, the training loss value is calculated as
log loss , using
the training data. The evaluation loss is the log loss calculated on the
evaluation data. Both loss types represent average loss values, averaged
over all examples in the respective datasets for each iteration.
You can also see the results of the model training by using the
ML.TRAINING_INFO function .
Evaluate the model
Evaluate the performance of the model by using the ML.EVALUATE function. The
ML.EVALUATE function evaluates the predicted values generated by the model
against the actual data. To calculate logistic regression specific
metrics, you can use the
ML.ROC_CURVE SQL function
or the
bigframes.ml.metrics.roc_curve BigQuery DataFrames function .
In this tutorial, you are using a binary classification model that
detects transactions. The values in the label column are the two classes
generated by the model: 0 (no transactions) and 1 (transaction made).
SQL
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

FROM
`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801' ))
The results should look like the following:
+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------+
| precision | recall | accuracy | f1_score | log_loss | roc_auc |
+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------+

+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------+
Because you performed a logistic regression, the results include the following
columns:
precision :
a metric for classification models. Precision identifies the frequency
with which a model was correct when predicting the positive class.
recall :
a metric for classification models that answers the following
question: Out of all the possible positive labels, how many did the model
correctly identify?
accuracy :
accuracy is the fraction of predictions that a classification model
got right.
f1_score :
a measure of the accuracy of the model. The f1 score is the harmonic average of
the precision and recall. An f1 score's best value is 1. The worst value is 0.
log_loss :
the loss function used in a logistic regression. This is the measure
of how far the model's predictions are from the correct labels.
roc_auc :
the area under the ROC
curve. This is the probability that a classifier is more confident that a
randomly chosen positive example is actually positive than that a randomly
chosen negative example is positive. For more information, see
Classification
in the Machine Learning Crash Course.
Query details
The initial SELECT statement retrieves the columns from your model.
The FROM clause uses the ML.EVALUATE function against your model.
The nested SELECT statement and FROM clause are the same as those
in the CREATE MODEL query.
The WHERE clause — _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'
— limits the number of tables scanned by the query. The date range
scanned is July 1, 2017 to August 1, 2017. This is the data you're using to
evaluate the predictive performance of the model. It was collected in the month
immediately following the time period spanned by the training data.

Query details
The initial SELECT statement retrieves the country column and sums the
predicted_label column. The predicted_label column is generated by the
ML.PREDICT function. When you use the ML.PREDICT function, the output
column name for the model is predicted_<label_column_name> . For linear
regression models, predicted_label is the estimated value of label .
For logistic regression models, predicted_label is the label that best
describes the given input data value, either 0 or 1 .
The ML.PREDICT function is used to predict results using your model.
The nested SELECT statement and FROM clause are the same as those
in the CREATE MODEL query.
The WHERE clause — _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'
— limits the number of tables scanned by the query. The date range
scanned is July 1, 2017 to August 1, 2017. This is the data for which you're
making predictions. It was collected in the month immediately following the time
period spanned by the training data.
The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses group the results by country and order
them by the sum of the predicted purchases in descending order.
The LIMIT clause is used here to display only the top 10 results.

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
You can delete the project you created, or keep the project and delete the
dataset.
Delete the dataset
Deleting your project removes all datasets and all tables in the project. If you
prefer to reuse the project, you can delete the dataset you created in this
tutorial:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
In the Explorer pane, expand your project, click Datasets ,
and then click the bqml_tutorial dataset that you created.
Click Delete .
In the Delete dataset dialog, confirm the delete command by typing
delete .
Click Delete .
Delete the project
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
