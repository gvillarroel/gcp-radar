Loading CSV data from Cloud Storage
When you load CSV data from Cloud Storage, you can load the data into a new
table or partition, or you can append to or overwrite an existing table or
partition. When your data is loaded into BigQuery, it is
converted into columnar format for
Capacitor
(BigQuery's storage format).
When you load data from Cloud Storage into a BigQuery table,
the dataset that contains the table must be in the same regional or multi-
regional location as the Cloud Storage bucket.
For information about loading CSV data from a local file, see
Loading data into BigQuery from a local data source .
Try it for yourself

BigQuery performs in real-world
scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and

Limitations
You are subject to the following limitations when you load data into
BigQuery from a Cloud Storage bucket:
BigQuery does not guarantee data consistency for external data
sources. Changes to the underlying data while a query is running can result in
unexpected behavior.
BigQuery doesn't support
Cloud Storage object versioning . If you
include a generation number in the Cloud Storage URI, then the load job
fails.
When you load CSV files into BigQuery, note the following:
CSV files don't support nested or repeated data.
Remove byte order mark (BOM) characters. They might cause unexpected issues.
If you use gzip compression,
BigQuery cannot read the data in parallel. Loading compressed
CSV data into BigQuery is slower than loading uncompressed data.
See Loading compressed and uncompressed data .
You cannot include both compressed and uncompressed files in the same load
job.
The maximum size for a gzip file is 4 GB.
Loading CSV data using schema autodetection
does not automatically detect headers if all of the columns are string types.
In this case, add a numerical column to the input or declare the schema
explicitly.
When you load CSV or JSON data, values in DATE columns must use the dash
( - ) separator and the date must be in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD
(year-month-day).
When you load JSON or CSV data, values in TIMESTAMP columns
must use a dash ( - ) or slash ( / ) separator for the date portion of the
timestamp, and the date must be in one of the following formats: YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) or
YYYY/MM/DD (year/month/day).
The hh:mm:ss (hour-minute-second) portion of the timestamp must use a colon
( : ) separator.
Your files must meet the CSV file size limits described in the
load jobs limits .
Before you begin
Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that give users the necessary
permissions to perform each task in this document, and create a dataset
to store your data.
Required permissions
To load data into BigQuery, you need IAM permissions to run a load job and load data into BigQuery tables and partitions. If you are loading data from Cloud Storage, you also need IAM permissions to access the bucket that contains your data.
Permissions to load data into BigQuery
To load data into a new BigQuery table or partition or to append or overwrite an existing table or partition, you need the following IAM permissions:
bigquery.tables.create
bigquery.tables.updateData
bigquery.tables.update
bigquery.jobs.create
Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need in order to load data into a BigQuery table or partition:
roles/bigquery.dataEditor
roles/bigquery.dataOwner
roles/bigquery.admin (includes the bigquery.jobs.create permission)
bigquery.user (includes the bigquery.jobs.create permission)
bigquery.jobUser (includes the bigquery.jobs.create permission)
Additionally, if you have the bigquery.datasets.create permission, you can create and
update tables using a load job in the datasets that you create.
For more information on IAM roles and permissions in
BigQuery, see Predefined roles and permissions .
Permissions to load data from Cloud Storage
To get the permissions that
you need to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin )
IAM role on the bucket.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket:
storage.buckets.get
storage.objects.get
storage.objects.list (required if you are using a URI wildcard )
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Create a dataset
Create a BigQuery dataset to store
your data.
CSV compression
You can use the gzip utility to compress CSV files. Note that gzip performs
full file compression, unlike the file content compression performed by
compression codecs for other file formats, such as Avro. Using gzip to
compress your CSV files might have a performance impact; for more information
about the trade-offs, see
Loading compressed and uncompressed data .
Loading CSV data into a table
To load CSV data from Cloud Storage into a new BigQuery
table, select one of the following options:
Console
To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the
Cloud Shell Editor, click Guide me :
Guide me
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the left pane, click explore Explorer .
In the Explorer pane, expand your project, click Datasets , and then select a dataset.
In the Dataset info section, click add_box Create table .
In the Create table pane, specify the following details:
In the Source section, select Google Cloud Storage in the Create table from list.
Then, do the following:
Select a file from the Cloud Storage bucket, or enter the
Cloud Storage URI .
You cannot include multiple URIs
in the Google Cloud console, but wildcards
are supported. The Cloud Storage bucket must be in the same
location as the dataset that contains the table you want to create, append, or
overwrite.
For File format , select
CSV .
In the Destination section, specify the following details:
For Dataset , select the dataset in which you want to create the
table.
In the Table field, enter the name of the table that you want to create.
Verify that the Table type field is set to Native table .
In the Schema section, enter the schema
definition.
To enable the auto detection of a schema,
select Auto detect .
You can enter schema information manually by using one of
the following methods:
Option 1: Click Edit as text and paste the schema in the form of a
JSON array. When you use a JSON array, you generate the schema using the
same process as creating a JSON schema file .
You can view the schema of an existing table in JSON format by entering the following
command:
bq show --format = prettyjson dataset.table
Option 2: Click add_box
Add field and enter the table schema. Specify each field's Name ,
Type ,
and Mode .
Optional: Specify Partition and cluster settings . For more information, see
Creating partitioned tables and
Creating and using clustered tables .
Click Advanced options and do the following:
For Write preference , leave Write if empty selected. This
option creates a new table and loads your data into it.
For Number of errors allowed , accept the default value of 0 or
enter the maximum number of rows containing errors that can be ignored.
If the number of rows with errors exceeds this value, the job will
result in an invalid message and fail. This option applies only to CSV and
JSON files.
For Time zone , enter the default time zone that will apply when parsing timestamp
values that have no specific time zone. Check
here for more
valid time zone names. If this value is not present, the timestamp values without specific
time zone is parsed using default time zone UTC.
For Date Format , enter the
format elements that define how the DATE values are formatted in the input files. This
field expects SQL styles format (for example, MM/DD/YYYY ). If this value is
present, this format is the only compatible DATE format.
Schema autodetection will
also decide DATE column type based on this format instead of the existing format. If this
value is not present, the DATE field is parsed with the
default formats .
For Datetime Format , enter the
format elements that define how the DATETIME values are formatted in the input files.
This field expects SQL styles format (for example, MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS.FF3 ).
If this value is present, this format is the only compatible DATETIME format.
Schema autodetection will
also decide DATETIME column type based on this format instead of the existing format. If
this value is not present, the DATETIME field is parsed with the
default formats .
For Time Format , enter the
format elements that define how the TIME values are formatted in the input files. This
field expects SQL styles format (for example, HH24:MI:SS.FF3 ). If this value is
present, this format is the only compatible TIME format.
Schema autodetection will
also decide TIME column type based on this format instead of the existing format. If this
value is not present, the TIME field is parsed with the
default formats .
For Timestamp Format , enter the
format elements that define how the TIMESTAMP values are formatted in the input files.
This field expects SQL styles format (for example, MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS.FF3 ).
If this value is present, this format is the only compatible TIMESTAMP format.
Schema autodetection will
also decide TIMESTAMP column type based on this format instead of the existing format. If
this value is not present, the TIMESTAMP field is parsed with the
default formats .
If you want to ignore values in a row that are not present in the table's schema, then
select Unknown values .
For Field delimiter , choose the character that separates the cells
in your CSV file: Comma , Tab , Pipe , or Custom . If you
choose Custom , enter the delimiter in the Custom field delimiter
box. The default value is Comma .
For Source column match , choose one of the following strategies
used to match the loaded columns to the schema.
Default : Default behavior is chosen based on how the schema is provided.
If autodetect is enabled, then the default behavior is to match columns by name.
Otherwise, the default is to match columns by position. This is done to keep the
behavior backward-compatible.
Position : Matches columns by position, assuming that the columns are
ordered the same way as the schema.
Name : Matches by name by reading the header row as the column names and
reordering columns to match the field names in the schema. Column names are read from
the last skipped row based on Header rows to skip .
For Header rows to skip , enter the number of header rows to skip
at the top of the CSV file. The default value is 0 .
For Quoted newlines , check Allow quoted newlines to allow
quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The
default value is false .
For Jagged rows , check Allow jagged rows to accept rows in CSV
files that are missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are
treated as nulls. If unchecked, records with missing trailing columns
are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an
invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is
false .
For Null markers , enter a list of custom strings that represents a NULL value
in CSV data.
For Encryption , click Customer-managed key to use a
Cloud Key Management Service key .
If you leave the Google-managed key setting,
BigQuery
encrypts the data at rest .
Click Create table .
Note: When you load data into an empty table by using the
Google Cloud console, you cannot add a label, description, table
expiration, or partition expiration.
After the table is created, you can update the table's expiration,
description, and labels, but you cannot add a partition expiration after a
table is created using the Google Cloud console. For more information, see
Managing tables .
SQL
Use the
LOAD DATA DDL statement .
The following example loads a CSV file into the new table mytable :
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, enter the following statement:
LOAD DATA OVERWRITE mydataset . mytable
( x INT64 , y STRING )
FROM FILES (
format = 'CSV' ,
uris = [ 'gs://bucket/path/file.csv' ] );
Click play_circle Run .
For more information about how to run queries, see Run an interactive query .
bq
Use the bq load command, specify CSV using the
--source_format flag, and include a Cloud Storage URI .
You can include a single URI, a comma-separated list of URIs, or a URI
containing a wildcard .
Supply the schema inline, in a schema definition file, or use
schema auto-detect . If you don't specify a
schema, and --autodetect is false , and the destination
table exists, then the schema of the destination table is used.
(Optional) Supply the --location flag and set the value to your
location .
Other optional flags include:
--allow_jagged_rows : When specified, accept rows in CSV files that are
missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are treated as nulls.
If unchecked, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad
records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned
in the job result. The default value is false .
--allow_quoted_newlines : When specified, allows quoted data sections
that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false .
--field_delimiter : The character that indicates the boundary between
columns in the data. Both \t and tab are allowed for tab delimiters.
The default value is , .
--null_marker : An optional custom string that represents a NULL value in
CSV data.
--null_markers : An optional comma-separated list of custom strings that
represent NULL values in CSV data. This option cannot be used with
--null_marker flag.
--source_column_match : Specifies the strategy used to match loaded
columns to the schema. You can specify POSITION to match loaded columns
by position, assuming that the columns are ordered the same way as the
schema. You can also specify NAME to match by name by reading the header
row as the column names and reordering columns to match the field names in
the schema. If this value is unspecified, then the default is based on how
the schema is provided. If --autodetect is enabled, then the default
behavior is to match columns by name. Otherwise, the default is to match
columns by position.
--skip_leading_rows : Specifies the number of header rows to skip
at the top of the CSV file. The default value is 0 .
--quote : The quote character to use to enclose records. The default
value is " . To indicate no quote character, use an empty string.
--max_bad_records : An integer that specifies the maximum number of bad
records allowed before the entire job fails. The default value is 0 . At
most, five errors of any type are returned regardless of the
--max_bad_records value.
--ignore_unknown_values : When specified, allows and ignores extra,
unrecognized values in CSV or JSON data.
--time_zone : An optional default time zone that will apply when
parsing timestamp values that have no specific time zone in CSV or JSON
data.
--date_format : An optional custom string that defines how the DATE
values are formatted in CSV or JSON data.
--datetime_format : An optional custom string that defines how the
DATETIME values are formatted in CSV or JSON data.
--time_format : An optional custom string that defines how the TIME
values are formatted in CSV or JSON data.
--timestamp_format : An optional custom string that defines how the
TIMESTAMP values are formatted in CSV or JSON data.
--autodetect : When specified, enable schema auto-detection for CSV and
JSON data.
--time_partitioning_type : Enables time-based partitioning on a table and
sets the partition type. Possible values are HOUR , DAY , MONTH , and
YEAR . This flag is optional when you create a
table partitioned on a DATE , DATETIME , or TIMESTAMP column. The
default partition type for time-based partitioning is DAY . You cannot
change the partitioning specification on an existing table.
--time_partitioning_expiration : An integer that specifies (in seconds)
when a time-based partition should be deleted. The expiration time evaluates
to the partition's UTC date plus the integer value.
--time_partitioning_field : The DATE or TIMESTAMP column used to
create a partitioned table. If time-based partitioning is enabled without
this value, an ingestion-time partitioned table is created.
--require_partition_filter : When enabled, this option requires users
to include a WHERE clause that specifies the partitions to query.
Requiring a partition filter may reduce cost and improve performance.
For more information, see Querying partitioned tables .
--clustering_fields : A comma-separated list of up to four column names
used to create a
clustered table .
--destination_kms_key : The Cloud KMS key for encryption of the
table data.
--column_name_character_map : Defines the scope and handling of
characters in column names, with the option of enabling
flexible column names .
Requires the --autodetect option for CSV files.

To load CSV data into BigQuery, enter the following command:
bq --location = location load \
--source_format = format \
dataset.table \
path_to_source \
schema
Where:
location is your location. The --location flag is optional.
For example, if you are using BigQuery in the Tokyo region,
you can set the flag's value to asia-northeast1 . You can set a default
value for the location using the .bigqueryrc file .
format is CSV .
dataset is an existing dataset.
table is the name of the table into which you're loading data.
path_to_source is a fully-qualified Cloud Storage URI
or a comma-separated list of URIs. Wildcards
are also supported.
schema is a valid schema. The schema can be a local JSON file,
or it can be typed inline as part of the command. You can also use the
--autodetect flag instead of supplying a schema definition.
Examples:
The following command loads data from gs://mybucket/mydata.csv into a
table named mytable in mydataset . The schema is defined in a local
schema file named myschema.json .
bq load \
-- source_format = CSV \
mydataset . mytable \
gs : // mybucket / mydata . csv \
./ myschema . json
The following command loads data from gs://mybucket/mydata.csv into a
table named mytable in mydataset . The schema is defined in a local
schema file named myschema.json . The CSV file includes two header rows.
If --skip_leading_rows is unspecified, the default behavior is to assume
the file does not contain headers.
bq load \
-- source_format = CSV \
-- skip_leading_rows = 2
mydataset . mytable \
gs : // mybucket / mydata . csv \
./ myschema . json
The following command loads data from gs://mybucket/mydata.csv into an
ingestion-time partitioned table named mytable in mydataset . The schema
is defined in a local schema file named myschema.json .
bq load \
-- source_format = CSV \
-- time_partitioning_type = DAY \
mydataset . mytable \
gs : // mybucket / mydata . csv \
./ myschema . json
The following command loads data from gs://mybucket/mydata.csv into a new
partitioned table named mytable in mydataset . The table is partitioned
on the mytimestamp column. The schema is defined in a local schema file
named myschema.json .
bq load \
-- source_format = CSV \
-- time_partitioning_field mytimestamp \
mydataset . mytable \
gs : // mybucket / mydata . csv \
./ myschema . json
The following command loads data from gs://mybucket/mydata.csv into a
table named mytable in mydataset . The schema is auto detected.
bq load \
-- autodetect \
-- source_format = CSV \
mydataset . mytable \
gs : // mybucket / mydata . csv
The following command loads data from gs://mybucket/mydata.csv into a
table named mytable in mydataset . The schema is defined inline in the
format field:data_type , field:data_type .
bq load \
-- source_format = CSV \
mydataset . mytable \
gs : // mybucket / mydata . csv \
qtr : STRING , sales : FLOAT , year : STRING
Note: When you specify the schema using the bq command-line tool, you cannot
include a RECORD ( STRUCT ) type, you cannot include a
field description, and you cannot specify the field mode. All field
modes default to NULLABLE . To include field descriptions, modes, and
RECORD types, supply a JSON schema file
instead.
The following command loads data from multiple files in gs://mybucket/
into a table named mytable in mydataset . The Cloud Storage URI uses a
wildcard. The schema is auto detected.
bq load \
-- autodetect \
-- source_format = CSV \
mydataset . mytable \
gs : // mybucket / mydata *. csv
The following command loads data from multiple files in gs://mybucket/
into a table named mytable in mydataset . The command includes a comma-
separated list of Cloud Storage URIs with wildcards. The schema is
defined in a local schema file named myschema.json .
bq load \
-- source_format = CSV \
mydataset . mytable \
"gs://mybucket/00/*.csv" , "gs://mybucket/01/*.csv" \
./ myschema . json
API
Create a load job that points to the source data in Cloud Storage.
(Optional) Specify your location in
the location property in the jobReference section of the job resource .
The source URIs property must be fully-qualified, in the format
gs:// bucket / object .
Each URI can contain one '*' wildcard character .
Specify the CSV data format by setting the sourceFormat property to
CSV .
To check the job status, call
jobs.get( job_id *) ,
where job_id is the ID of the job returned by the initial
request.
If status.state = DONE , the job completed successfully.
If the status.errorResult property is present, the request failed,
and that object will include information describing what went wrong.
When a request fails, no table is created and no data is loaded.
If status.errorResult is absent, the job finished successfully,
although there might have been some nonfatal errors, such as problems
importing a few rows. Nonfatal errors are listed in the returned job
object's status.errors property.
API notes:
Load jobs are atomic and consistent; if a load job fails, none of the data
is available, and if a load job succeeds, all of the data is available.
As a best practice, generate a unique ID and pass it as
jobReference.jobId when calling jobs.insert to create a load job. This
approach is more robust to network failure because the client can poll or
retry on the known job ID.
Calling jobs.insert on a given job ID is idempotent. You can retry as
many times as you like on the same job ID, and at most one of those
operations will succeed.

Appending to or overwriting a table with CSV data
You can load additional data into a table either from source files or by
appending query results.
In the Google Cloud console, use the Write preference option to specify
what action to take when you load data from a source file or from a query
result.
You have the following options when you load additional data into a table:
Console option
bq tool flag
BigQuery API property
Description
Write if empty
Not supported
WRITE_EMPTY
Writes the data only if the table is empty.
Append to table
--noreplace or --replace=false ; if
--[no]replace is unspecified, the default is append
WRITE_APPEND
( Default )
Appends the data to the end of the table.
Overwrite table
--replace or --replace=true
WRITE_TRUNCATE
Erases all existing data in a table before writing the new data.
This action also deletes the table schema, row level security, and removes any
Cloud KMS key.
If you load data into an existing table, the load job can append the data or
overwrite the table.
Note: This page does not cover appending or overwriting partitioned tables. For
information on appending and overwriting partitioned tables, see:
Appending to and overwriting partitioned table data .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the left pane, click explore Explorer .
In the Explorer pane, expand your project, click Datasets , and then select a dataset.
In the Dataset info section, click add_box Create table .
In the Create table pane, specify the following details:
In the Source section, select Google Cloud Storage in the Create table from list.
Then, do the following:
Select a file from the Cloud Storage bucket, or enter the
Cloud Storage URI .
You cannot include multiple URIs
in the Google Cloud console, but wildcards
are supported. The Cloud Storage bucket must be in the same
location as the dataset that contains the table you want to create, append, or
overwrite.
For File format , select
CSV .
Note: It is possible to modify the table's schema when you append or
overwrite it. For more information about supported schema changes during a
load operation, see Modifying table schemas .
In the Destination section, specify the following details:
For Dataset , select the dataset in which you want to create the
table.
In the Table field, enter the name of the table that you want to create.
Verify that the Table type field is set to Native table .
In the Schema section, enter the schema
definition.
To enable the auto detection of a schema,
select Auto detect .
You can enter schema information manually by using one of
the following methods:
Option 1: Click Edit as text and paste the schema in the form of a
JSON array. When you use a JSON array, you generate the schema using the
same process as creating a JSON schema file .
You can view the schema of an existing table in JSON format by entering the following
command:
bq show --format = prettyjson dataset.table
Option 2: Click add_box
Add field and enter the table schema. Specify each field's Name ,
Type ,
and Mode .
Note: It is possible to modify the table's schema when you append or
overwrite it. For more information about supported schema changes during a
load operation, see
Modifying table schemas .
Optional: Specify Partition and cluster settings . For more information, see
Creating partitioned tables and
Creating and using clustered tables .
You
cannot convert a table to a partitioned or clustered table by appending or
overwriting it. The Google Cloud console does not support
appending to or overwriting partitioned or clustered tables in a load job.
Click Advanced options and do the following:
For Write preference , choose Append to table or Overwrite
table .
For Number of errors allowed , accept the default value of 0 or
enter the maximum number of rows containing errors that can be ignored.
If the number of rows with errors exceeds this value, the job will
result in an invalid message and fail. This option applies only to CSV and
JSON files.
For Time zone , enter the default time zone that will apply when parsing timestamp
values that have no specific time zone. Check
here for more
valid time zone names. If this value is not present, the timestamp values without specific
time zone is parsed using default time zone UTC.
For Date Format , enter the
format elements that define how the DATE values are formatted in the input files. This
field expects SQL styles format (for example, MM/DD/YYYY ). If this value is
present, this format is the only compatible DATE format.
Schema autodetection will
also decide DATE column type based on this format instead of the existing format. If this
value is not present, the DATE field is parsed with the
default formats .
For Datetime Format , enter the
format elements that define how the DATETIME values are formatted in the input files.
This field expects SQL styles format (for example, MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS.FF3 ).
If this value is present, this format is the only compatible DATETIME format.
Schema autodetection will
also decide DATETIME column type based on this format instead of the existing format. If
this value is not present, the DATETIME field is parsed with the
default formats .
For Time Format , enter the
format elements that define how the TIME values are formatted in the input files. This
field expects SQL styles format (for example, HH24:MI:SS.FF3 ). If this value is
present, this format is the only compatible TIME format.
Schema autodetection will
also decide TIME column type based on this format instead of the existing format. If this
value is not present, the TIME field is parsed with the
default formats .
For Timestamp Format , enter the
format elements that define how the TIMESTAMP values are formatted in the input files.
This field expects SQL styles format (for example, MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS.FF3 ).
If this value is present, this format is the only compatible TIMESTAMP format.
Schema autodetection will
also decide TIMESTAMP column type based on this format instead of the existing format. If
this value is not present, the TIMESTAMP field is parsed with the
default formats .
If you want to ignore values in a row that are not present in the table's schema, then
select Unknown values .
For Field delimiter , choose the character that separates the cells
in your CSV file: Comma , Tab , Pipe , or Custom . If you
choose Custom , enter the delimiter in the Custom field delimiter
box. The default value is Comma .
For Source column match , choose one of the following strategies
used to match the loaded columns to the schema.
Default : Default behavior is chosen based on how the schema is provided.
If autodetect is enabled, then the default behavior is to match columns by name.
Otherwise, the default is to match columns by position. This is done to keep the
behavior backward-compatible.
Position : Matches columns by position, assuming that the columns are
ordered the same way as the schema.
Name : Matches by name by reading the header row as the column names and
reordering columns to match the field names in the schema. Column names are read from
the last skipped row based on Header rows to skip .
For Header rows to skip , enter the number of header rows to skip
at the top of the CSV file. The default value is 0 .
For Quoted newlines , check Allow quoted newlines to allow
quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The
default value is false .
For Jagged rows , check Allow jagged rows to accept rows in CSV
files that are missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are
treated as nulls. If unchecked, records with missing trailing columns
are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an
invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is
false .
For Null markers , enter a list of custom strings that represents a NULL value
in CSV data.
For Encryption , click Customer-managed key to use a
Cloud Key Management Service key .
If you leave the Google-managed key setting,
BigQuery
encrypts the data at rest .
Click Create table .
SQL
Use the
LOAD DATA DDL statement .
The following example appends a CSV file to the table mytable :
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, enter the following statement:
LOAD DATA INTO mydataset . mytable
FROM FILES (
format = 'CSV' ,
uris = [ 'gs://bucket/path/file.csv' ] );
Click play_circle Run .
For more information about how to run queries, see Run an interactive query .
bq
Use the bq load command, specify CSV using the
--source_format flag, and include a Cloud Storage URI .
You can include a single URI, a comma-separated list of URIs, or a URI
containing a wildcard .
Supply the schema inline, in a schema definition file, or use
schema auto-detect . If you don't specify a
schema, and --autodetect is false , and the destination
table exists, then the schema of the destination table is used.
Specify the --replace flag to overwrite the
table. Use the --noreplace flag to append data to the table. If no flag is
specified, the default is to append data.
It is possible to modify the table's schema when you append or
overwrite it. For more information on supported schema changes during a load
operation, see Modifying table schemas .
(Optional) Supply the --location flag and set the value to your
location .
Other optional flags include:
--allow_jagged_rows : When specified, accept rows in CSV files that are
missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are treated as nulls.
If unchecked, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad
records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned
in the job result. The default value is false .
--allow_quoted_newlines : When specified, allows quoted data sections
that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false .
--field_delimiter : The character that indicates the boundary between
columns in the data. Both \t and tab are allowed for tab delimiters.
The default value is , .
--null_marker : An optional custom string that represents a NULL value in
CSV data.
--null_markers : An optional comma-separated list of custom strings
that represent NULL values in CSV data. This option cannot be used
with --null_marker flag.
--source_column_match : Specifies the strategy used to match loaded
columns to the schema. You can specify POSITION to match loaded
columns by position, assuming that the columns are ordered the same
way as the schema. You can also specify NAME to match by name by
reading the header row as the column names and reordering columns to
match the field names in the schema. If this value is unspecified,
then the default is based on how the schema is provided. If
--autodetect is enabled, then the default behavior is to match
columns by name. Otherwise, the default is to match columns by
position.
--skip_leading_rows : Specifies the number of header rows to skip
at the top of the CSV file. The default value is 0 .
--quote : The quote character to use to enclose records. The default
value is " . To indicate no quote character, use an empty string.
--max_bad_records : An integer that specifies the maximum number of bad
records allowed before the entire job fails. The default value is 0 . At
most, five errors of any type are returned regardless of the
--max_bad_records value.
--ignore_unknown_values : When specified, allows and ignores extra,
unrecognized values in CSV or JSON data.
--time_zone : An optional default time zone that will apply when parsing
timestamp values that have no specific time zone in CSV or JSON data.
--date_format : An optional custom string that defines how the DATE
values are formatted in CSV or JSON data.
--datetime_format : An optional custom string that defines how the
DATETIME values are formatted in CSV or JSON data.
--time_format : An optional custom string that defines how the TIME
values are formatted in CSV or JSON data.
--timestamp_format : An optional custom string that defines how the
TIMESTAMP values are formatted in CSV or JSON data.
--autodetect : When specified, enable schema auto-detection for CSV and
JSON data.
--destination_kms_key : The Cloud KMS key for encryption of the
table data.

Loading hive-partitioned CSV data
BigQuery supports loading hive-partitioned CSV data stored on
Cloud Storage and will populate the hive partitioning columns as columns in
the destination BigQuery managed table. For more information, see
Loading Externally Partitioned Data from Cloud Storage .
Details of loading CSV data
This section describes how BigQuery handles various CSV formatting
options.
Encoding
BigQuery expects CSV data to be UTF-8 encoded. If you have
CSV files with other supported encoding types, you should explicitly specify the
encoding so that BigQuery can properly convert the data to UTF-8.
BigQuery supports the following encoding types for CSV files:
UTF-8
ISO-8859-1
UTF-16BE (UTF-16 Big Endian)
UTF-16LE (UTF-16 Little Endian)
UTF-32BE (UTF-32 Big Endian)
UTF-32LE (UTF-32 Little Endian)
If you don't specify an encoding, or if you specify UTF-8 encoding when the CSV
file is not UTF-8 encoded, BigQuery attempts to convert the data
to UTF-8. Generally, if the CSV file is ISO-8859-1 encoded, your data will be
loaded successfully, but it may not exactly match what you expect. If the CSV
file is UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, or UTF-32LE encoded, the load might fail.
To avoid unexpected failures, specify the correct encoding by using the
--encoding flag .
Note: If the CSV file is UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, or UTF-32LE encoded, and
the --allow_quoted_newlines flag is set as
true , then the CSV file has a maximum size limit of 1GB. Note: By default, if the CSV file contains the ASCII 0 (NULL) character, you
can't load the data into BigQuery. If you want to allow ASCII 0
and other ASCII control characters, then set
--preserve_ascii_control_characters=true to your load jobs.
If BigQuery can't convert a character other than the ASCII 0
character, BigQuery converts the character to the standard
Unicode replacement character: �.
Field delimiters
Delimiters in CSV files can be any single-byte character. If the source file
uses ISO-8859-1 encoding, any character can be a delimiter. If the source file
uses UTF-8 encoding, any character in the decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F)
can be used without modification. You can insert an ISO-8859-1 character outside
of this range as a delimiter, and BigQuery will interpret it
correctly. However, if you use a multibyte character as a delimiter, some of the
bytes will be interpreted incorrectly as part of the field value.
Generally, it's a best practice to use a standard delimiter, such as a tab,
pipe, or comma. The default is a comma.
Data types
Boolean . BigQuery can parse any of the following pairs for
Boolean data: 1 or 0, true or false, t or f, yes or no, or y or n (all case
insensitive). Schema autodetection
automatically detects any of these except 0 and 1.
Bytes . Columns with BYTES types must be encoded as Base64.
Date . Columns with DATE types must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD .
Datetime . Columns with DATETIME types must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS[.SSSSSS] .
Geography . Columns with GEOGRAPHY types must contain strings in one of the
following formats:
Well-known text (WKT)
Well-known binary (WKB)
GeoJSON
If you use WKB, the value should be hex encoded.
The following list shows examples of valid data:
WKT: POINT(1 2)
GeoJSON: { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [1, 2] }
Hex encoded WKB: 0101000000feffffffffffef3f0000000000000040
Before loading GEOGRAPHY data, also read
Loading geospatial data .
Interval . Columns with INTERVAL types must be in the format
Y-M D H:M:S[.F] , where:
Y = Year. Supported range is 0-10,000.
M = Month. Supported range is 1-12.
D = Day. Supported range is 1-[last day of the indicated month].
H = Hour.
M = Minute.
S = Second.
[.F] = Fractions of a second up to six digits, with microsecond precision.
You can indicate a negative value by prepending a dash (-).
The following list shows examples of valid data:
10-6 0 0:0:0
0-0 -5 0:0:0
0-0 0 0:0:1.25
To load INTERVAL data, you must use the
bq load command and use
the --schema flag to specify a schema. You can't upload INTERVAL data by using
the console.
JSON . Quotes are escaped by using the two character sequence "" . For more
information, see an example of
loading JSON data from a CSV file
Time . Columns with TIME types must be in the format HH:MM:SS[.SSSSSS] .
Timestamp . BigQuery accepts various timestamp formats.
The timestamp must include a date portion and a time portion.
The date portion can be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD .
The timestamp portion must be formatted as HH:MM[:SS[.SSSSSS]] (seconds and
fractions of seconds are optional).
The date and time must be separated by a space or 'T'.
Optionally, the date and time can be followed by a UTC offset or the UTC zone
designator ( Z ). For more information, see
Time zones .
For example, any of the following are valid timestamp values:
2018-08-19 12:11
2018-08-19 12:11:35
2018-08-19 12:11:35.22
2018/08/19 12:11
2018-07-05 12:54:00 UTC
2018-08-19 07:11:35.220 -05:00
2018-08-19T12:11:35.220Z
If you provide a schema, BigQuery also accepts Unix epoch time for
timestamp values. However, schema autodetection doesn't detect this case, and
treats the value as a numeric or string type instead.
Examples of Unix epoch timestamp values:
1534680695
1.534680695e12
RANGE . Represented in CSV files in the format
[ LOWER_BOUND , UPPER_BOUND ) ,
where LOWER_BOUND and UPPER_BOUND
are valid DATE , DATETIME , or TIMESTAMP strings. NULL and UNBOUNDED
represent unbounded start or end values.
Note: Since the range CSV format contains a comma, if the CSV delimiter is a
comma, it must be surrounded by double quotes for the CSV file to be valid.
The following are example of CSV values for RANGE<DATE> :
"[2020-01-01, 2021-01-01)"
"[UNBOUNDED, 2021-01-01)"
"[2020-03-01, NULL)"
"[UNBOUNDED, UNBOUNDED)"
Schema auto-detection
This section describes the behavior of
schema auto-detection when loading CSV files.
CSV delimiter
BigQuery detects the following delimiters:
comma ( , )
pipe ( | )
tab ( \t )
CSV header
BigQuery infers headers by comparing the first row of the file
with other rows in the file. If the first line contains only strings, and the
other lines contain other data types, BigQuery assumes that the
first row is a header row. BigQuery assigns column names based on the field names in the header row. The names might be modified to meet the naming rules for columns in BigQuery. For example, spaces will be replaced with underscores.
Otherwise, BigQuery assumes the first row is a data row, and
assigns generic column names such as string_field_1 . Note that after a table
is created, the column names cannot be updated in the schema, although you can
change the names
manually
after the table is created. Another option is to provide an explicit schema
instead of using autodetect.
You might have a CSV file with a header row, where all of the data fields are
strings. In that case, BigQuery will not automatically detect that
the first row is a header. Use the --skip_leading_rows option to skip the
header row. Otherwise, the header will be imported as data. Also consider
providing an explicit schema in this case, so that you can assign column names.
CSV quoted new lines
BigQuery detects quoted new line characters within a CSV field
and does not interpret the quoted new line character as a row boundary.
Troubleshoot parsing errors
If there's a problem parsing your CSV files, then the
load job's errors resource is
populated with the error details.
Generally, these errors identify the start of the problematic line with a byte
offset. For uncompressed files you can use gcloud storage with the
--recursive argument to access the relevant line.
For example, you run the bq load command
and receive an error:
bq load
--skip_leading_rows=1 \
--source_format=CSV \
mydataset.mytable \
gs://my-bucket/mytable.csv \
'Number:INTEGER,Name:STRING,TookOffice:STRING,LeftOffice:STRING,Party:STRING'
The error in the output is similar to the following:
Waiting on bqjob_r5268069f5f49c9bf_0000018632e903d7_1 ... (0s)
Current status: DONE
BigQuery error in load operation: Error processing job
'myproject:bqjob_r5268069f5f49c9bf_0000018632e903d7_1': Error while reading
data, error message: Error detected while parsing row starting at position: 1405.
Error: Data between close quote character (") and field separator.
File: gs://my-bucket/mytable.csv
Failure details:
- gs://my-bucket/mytable.csv : Error while reading data,
error message: Error detected while parsing row starting at
position: 1405 . Error: Data between close quote character (") and
field separator. File: gs://my-bucket/mytable.csv
- Error while reading data, error message: CSV processing encountered
too many errors, giving up. Rows: 22; errors: 1; max bad: 0; error
percent: 0
Based on the preceding error, there's a format error in the file.
To view the file's content, run the gcloud storage cat command :
gcloud storage cat 1405 -1505 gs://my-bucket/mytable.csv --recursive
The output is similar to the following:
16,Abraham Lincoln,"March 4, 1861", "April 15, "1865 ,Republican
18,Ulysses S. Grant,"March 4, 1869",
...
Based on the output of the file, the problem is a misplaced quote in
"April 15, "1865 .
Compressed CSV files
Debugging parsing errors is more challenging for compressed CSV files, since
the reported byte offset refers to the location in the uncompressed file.
The following gcloud storage cat command
streams the file from Cloud Storage, decompresses the file, identifies
the appropriate byte offset, and prints the line with the format error:
gcloud storage cat gs://my-bucket/mytable.csv.gz | gunzip - | tail -c +1406 | head -n 1
The output is similar to the following:
16,Abraham Lincoln,"March 4, 1861", "April 15, "1865 ,Republican
Troubleshoot quota errors
Use the information in this section to troubleshoot quota or limit errors
related to loading CSV files into BigQuery.
Loading CSV files quota errors
If you load a large CSV file using the bq load command with the
--allow_quoted_newlines flag ,
you might encounter this error.
Error message
Input CSV files are not splittable and at least one of the files is larger than
the maximum allowed size. Size is: ...
Resolution
To resolve this quota error, do the following:
Set the --allow_quoted_newlines flag to false .
Split the CSV file into smaller chunks that are each less than 4 GB.
For more information about limits that apply when you load data into
BigQuery, see Load jobs .
CSV options
To change how BigQuery parses CSV data, specify additional options
in the Google Cloud console, the bq command-line tool, or the API.
For more information on the CSV format, see
RFC 4180 .
CSV option
Console option
bq tool flag
BigQuery API property
Description
Field delimiter
Field delimiter: Comma, Tab, Pipe, Custom
-F or --field_delimiter
fieldDelimiter
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) The separator for fields in a CSV file. The separator can be
any ISO-8859-1 single-byte character. BigQuery
converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and uses the first byte of
the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.
BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" to specify a
tab separator. The default value is a comma (`,`).
Header rows
Header rows to skip
--skip_leading_rows
skipLeadingRows
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) An integer indicating the number of header rows in the source
data.
Source column match
Source column match: Default, Position, Name
--source_column_match
sourceColumnMatch
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) This
controls the strategy used to match loaded columns to the schema.
Supported values include:
POSITION : matches by position. This option assumes that
the columns are ordered the same way as the schema.
NAME : matches by name. This option reads the header row
as column names and reorders columns to match the field names in the
schema. Column names are read from the last skipped row based on the
skipLeadingRows property.
If this value is unspecified, then the default is based on how the schema
is provided. If autodetect is enabled, then the default behavior is to
match columns by name. Otherwise, the default is to match columns by
position. This is done to keep the behavior backward-compatible.
Number of bad records allowed
Number of errors allowed
--max_bad_records
maxBadRecords
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery
can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this
value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value
is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
Newline characters
Allow quoted newlines
--allow_quoted_newlines
allowQuotedNewlines
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) Indicates whether to allow quoted data sections that contain
newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.
Custom null values
None
--null_marker
nullMarker
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file.
For example, if you specify "\N", BigQuery interprets "\N"
as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty
string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery
throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except
for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery
interprets the empty string as an empty value.
Trailing optional columns
Allow jagged rows
--allow_jagged_rows
allowJaggedRows
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) Accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. The
missing values are treated as nulls. If false, records with missing
trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad
records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value
is false. Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other formats.
Unknown values
Ignore unknown values
--ignore_unknown_values
ignoreUnknownValues
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values
that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values
are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad
records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is
returned in the job result. The default value is false. The
sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery
treats as an extra value:
CSV: Trailing columns
JSON: Named values that don't match any column names
Quote
Quote character: Double quote, Single quote, None, Custom
--quote
quote
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file.
BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and
then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its
raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data
does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty
string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set
the allowQuotedNewlines property to true . To
include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it
with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to
escape the default character ' " ', use ' "" '.
Encoding
None
-E or --encoding
encoding
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional) The character encoding of the data. The supported values are
UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, or UTF-32LE.
The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery
decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the
values of the quote and fieldDelimiter
properties.
ASCII control character
None
--preserve_ascii_control_characters
None
(Optional) If you want to allow ASCII 0 and other ASCII control
characters, then set --preserve_ascii_control_characters to
true to your load jobs.
Null Markers
Null Markers
--null_markers
nullMarkers
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional)
A list of custom strings that represents a NULL value in CSV
data. This option cannot be used with --null_marker
option.
Time Zone
Time Zone
--time_zone
timeZone
( Java ,
Python )
(Optional)
Default time zone that will apply when parsing timestamp values
