Migrate code with the batch SQL translator
Note: For API-based translations, including new batch translations, we recommend
that you use the BigQuery Migration API
to translate your SQL scripts. The BigQuery Migration API works much like the
batch SQL translator, but without the need to install or use client code.
This document describes how to use the batch SQL translator in
BigQuery to translate scripts written in other SQL dialects into
GoogleSQL
queries. This document is intended for users who are familiar with the
Google Cloud console .
Before you begin
Before you submit a translation job, complete the following steps:
Ensure that you have all the required permissions.
Enable the BigQuery Migration API.
Collect the source files containing the SQL scripts and queries to be
translated.
Optional. Create a metadata file to improve the accuracy of the translation.
Optional. Decide if you need to map SQL object names in the source files
to new names in BigQuery. Determine what name mapping rules to
use if this is necessary.
Decide what method to use to submit the translation job.
Upload the source files to Cloud Storage.
Required permissions
You must have the following permissions on the project to enable the
BigQuery Migration Service:
resourcemanager.projects.get
serviceusage.services.enable
serviceusage.services.get
You need the following permissions on the project to access and use the
BigQuery Migration Service:
bigquerymigration.workflows.create
bigquerymigration.workflows.get
bigquerymigration.workflows.list
bigquerymigration.workflows.delete
bigquerymigration.subtasks.get
bigquerymigration.subtasks.list
Alternatively, you can use the following roles to get the same permissions:
bigquerymigration.viewer - Read only access.
bigquerymigration.editor - Read/write access.
To access the Cloud Storage buckets for input and output files:
storage.objects.get on the source Cloud Storage bucket.
storage.objects.list on the source Cloud Storage bucket.
storage.objects.create on the destination Cloud Storage bucket.
You can have all the above necessary Cloud Storage permissions from
the following roles:
roles/storage.objectAdmin
roles/storage.admin
Enable the BigQuery Migration API
If your Google Cloud CLI project was created before February 15, 2022, enable
the BigQuery Migration API as follows:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery Migration API page.
Go to BigQuery Migration API
Click Enable .
Note: Projects created after February 15, 2022 have this API enabled automatically.
Collect source files
Source files must be text files that contain valid SQL for the source dialect.
Source files can also include comments. Do your best to ensure the SQL is valid,
using whatever methods are available to you.
Create metadata files
To help the service generate more accurate translation results, we recommend
that you provide metadata files. However, this isn't mandatory.
You can use the dwh-migration-dumper command-line extraction tool to generate the metadata
information, or you can provide your own metadata files. Once metadata files are prepared, you can include them along with the source files in the translation
source folder. The translator automatically detects them and leverages them
to translate source files, you don't need to configure any extra settings to enable this.
To generate metadata information by using the
dwh-migration-dumper tool, see
Generate metadata for translation .
To provide your own metadata, collect the data definition language (DDL)
statements for the SQL objects in your source system into separate text files.
Decide how to submit the translation job
You have three options for submitting a batch translation job:
Batch translation client : Configure a job by changing settings in
a configuration file, and submit the job using the command line. This
approach doesn't require you to manually upload source files to
Cloud Storage. The client still uses Cloud Storage
to store files during translation job processing.
The legacy batch translation client is an open-source Python
client that lets you translate source files located on your local
machine and have the translated files output to a local directory.
You configure the client for basic use by changing a few settings in
its configuration file. If you choose to, you can also configure the client to
address more complex tasks like macro replacement, and pre- and
postprocessing of translation inputs and outputs. For more information,
see the batch translation client
readme .
Google Cloud console : Configure and submit a job using a user
interface. This approach requires you to upload source files to
Cloud Storage.
Create configuration YAML files
You can optionally create and use configuration configuration YAML files
to customize your batch translations. These files can be used to transform your
translation output in various ways. For example,
you can create a configuration YAML file to change the case of a SQL object
during translation.
If you want to use the Google Cloud console or the BigQuery Migration API for a
batch translation job, you can upload the configuration YAML file to the
Cloud Storage bucket containing the source files .
If you want to use the batch translation client, you can place the configuration YAML
file in the local translation input folder.
Upload input files to Cloud Storage
If you want to use the Google Cloud console or the BigQuery Migration API
to perform a translation job, you must upload the source files containing
the queries and scripts you want to translate to Cloud Storage. You
can also upload any metadata files or configuration YAML files
to the same Cloud Storage bucket and directory containing the source files.
For more information about creating buckets and uploading files to
Cloud Storage, see Create buckets
and Upload objects from a filesystem .
Supported SQL dialects
The batch SQL translator is part of the BigQuery Migration Service. The
batch SQL translator can translate the
following SQL dialects into GoogleSQL:
Amazon Redshift SQL
Apache HiveQL and Beeline CLI
IBM Netezza SQL and NZPLSQL
Teradata and Teradata Vantage:
SQL
Basic Teradata Query (BTEQ)
Teradata Parallel Transport (TPT)
Additionally, translation of the following SQL dialects is supported in
preview :
Apache Impala SQL
Apache Spark SQL
Azure Synapse T-SQL
GoogleSQL (BigQuery)
Greenplum SQL
IBM DB2 SQL
MySQL SQL
Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, Exadata
PostgreSQL SQL
Trino or PrestoSQL
Snowflake SQL
SQL Server T-SQL
SQLite
Vertica SQL
Important: Translation is done on a best effort basis. Translation success
can vary, depending on the uniqueness and complexity of the SQL statements
in your source scripts. You might need to manually translate some scripts.
Use the Actions tab in the Google Cloud console output to
diagnose and correct translation issues.
Handling unsupported SQL functions with helper UDFs
When translating SQL from a source dialect to BigQuery, some functions might not have a direct equivalent. To address this, the BigQuery Migration Service (and the broader BigQuery community) provide helper user-defined functions (UDFs) that replicate the behavior of these unsupported source dialect functions.
These UDFs are often found in the bqutil public dataset, allowing translated queries to initially reference them using the format bqutil.<dataset>.<function>() . For example, bqutil.fn.cw_count() .
Important considerations for production environments:
While bqutil offers convenient access to these helper UDFs for initial translation and testing, direct reliance on bqutil for production workloads is not recommended for several reasons:
Version control: The bqutil project hosts the latest version of these UDFs, which means their definitions can change over time. Relying directly on bqutil could lead to unexpected behavior or breaking changes in your production queries if a UDF's logic is updated.
Dependency isolation: Deploying UDFs to your own project isolates your production environment from external changes.
Customization: You might need to modify or optimize these UDFs to better suit your specific business logic or performance requirements. This is only possible if they are within your own project.
Security and governance: Your organization's security policies might restrict direct access to public datasets like bqutil for production data processing. Copying UDFs to your controlled environment aligns with such policies.
Deploying helper UDFs to your project:
For reliable and stable production use, you should deploy these helper UDFs into your own project and dataset. This gives you full control over their version, customization, and access.
For detailed instructions on how to deploy these UDFs, refer to the UDFs deployment guide on GitHub . This guide provides the necessary scripts and steps to copy the UDFs into your environment.

Submit a translation job
Follow these steps to start a translation job, view its progress, and see the
results.
Console
These steps assume you have source files uploaded into a
Cloud Storage bucket already.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the SQL Translation page.
Go to SQL Translation
In the SQL translation panel, click Start translation .
For Translation configuration , enter the following:
For Display name , type a name for the translation job. The name
can contain letters, numbers or underscores.
For Processing location , select the location where you want the
translation job to run. For example, if you are in Europe and you
don't want your data to cross any location boundaries, select the
eu region. The translation job performs best when you choose the same
location as your source file bucket.
For Source dialect , select the SQL dialect that you want to
translate.
For Target dialect , select GoogleSQL .
Click Next .
For File location details , specify the Cloud Storage paths to use
for translation input and output. You can type the paths in the format
bucket_name/folder_name/ or use the Browse option to navigate to a
folder.
For Output directory location , specify a path to the destination
Cloud Storage folder for the translated files. This serves as a root
directory for all translation output.
Choose one or more Input directory locations containing the path to
the SQL files to translate.
Each input directory can optionally be given an Output
subdirectory name underneath the root output directory if necessary.
Click Next .
Select any the optional settings that you need to customize metadata and
any additional translation outputs.
You can further customize translation behavior by creating
configuration YAML files and placing these files in the input Cloud Storage
bucket. These files can be used to set rename objects, enable optimizations,
enhance translations with Gemini and more.
For more information about configuration YAML files, see
Create a configuration YAML file .
Click Create to start the translation job.
Once the translation job is created, you can see its status in the
translation jobs list.
Batch translation client
Note: We recommend that new translations use the
BigQuery Migration API
instead of the batch translation client.
Install the batch translation client and the Google Cloud CLI .
Generate a gcloud CLI credential file .
In the batch translation client installation directory, use the text
editor of your choice to open the
config.yaml file and modify the following settings:
project_number : Type the project number of the project you want to
use for the batch translation job. You can find this in the
Project info pane on the
Google Cloud console welcome page for
the project.
gcs_bucket : Type the name of the Cloud Storage bucket that the batch
translation client uses to store files during translation job
processing.
input_directory : Type the absolute or relative path to the directory
containing the source files and any metadata files.
output_directory : Type the absolute or relative path to the target
directory for the translated files.
Save the changes and close the config.yaml file.
Place your source and metadata files in the input directory.
Run the batch translation client using the following command:
bin / dwh - migration - client
Create a translation job.
The following example shows a command to create a translation job. The command will run the workflow and show output if this workflow is successful.
gcloud bq migration-workflows create --location = us --config-file = CONFIG_FILE_NAME .json
The following example shows a command to create and run the workflow with the --async flag. The command will create and run the workflow and return immediately with a link to the workflow.
gcloud bq migration-workflows create --location = LOCATION --config-file = CONFIG_FILE_NAME .json --async
The following example shows a command to list your translation jobs:
gcloud bq migration-workflows list --location = LOCATION
Replace the following:
LOCATION : the location of the Google Cloud project that is running this translation job.
CONFIG_FILE_NAME : the name of the config.yaml file.
Once the translation job is created, you can see its status in the
translation jobs list in the Google Cloud console.
Optional. Once the translation job is completed, delete the files that
the job created in the Cloud Storage bucket you specified, in order
to avoid storage costs.
BigQuery CLI
You can run the batch SQL translator using the bq command-line tool command-line tool with the following steps:
Create a translation configuration file in either YAML or JSON. In this file, you must define the path to the source file, the output destination, and the source and target dialects of your translation.
The following example shows a translation configuration YAML file for a Teradata to BigQuery translation:
tasks:
translation_task:
type: Teradata2BigQuery_Translation
translationDetails:
sourceTargetMapping:
- sourceSpec:
baseUri: gs://bq-translations/input
targetSpec:
relativePath: output
targetBaseUri: gs://bq-translations
targetTypes:
- sql
sourceEnvironment:
defaultDatabase: default_db
schemaSearchPath:
- foo
The following example shows a translation configuration JSON file for a Teradata to BigQuery translation:
{
"tasks" : {
"translation_task" : {
"type" : "Teradata2BigQuery_Translation" ,
"translationDetails" : {
"sourceTargetMapping" : [
{
"sourceSpec" : {
"literal" : {
"literalString" : "sel 1" ,
"relativePath" : "my_input_1"
} ,
"encoding" : "UTF-8"
}
} ,
{
"sourceSpec" : {
"literal" : {
"literalString" : "sel 2" ,
"relativePath" : "my_input_2"
} ,
"encoding" : "UTF-8"
}
}
] ,
"targetReturnLiterals" : [
"sql/my_input_1" ,
"sql/my_input_2"
]
}
}
}
}
Once the translation configuration is created, run the following command to run the translation job.
bq mk --migration_workflow --location = LOCATION --config_file = CONFIG_FILE_NAME .json
Replace the following:
LOCATION : the location of the Google Cloud project that is running this translation job.
CONFIG_FILE_NAME : the name of the config.yaml file.
To view details about a specific translation job, run the following command:
bq show --migration_workflow projects/ PROJECT_ID / locations/us/workflows/ WORKFLOW_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project that is running this translation job.
WORKFLOW_ID : the ID of the translation job.
To see the results of a specific translation job, run the following command:
gcloud bq migration-workflows describe projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us/workflows/ WORKFLOW_ID
To remove a translation job from the list, run the following command:
bq rm --migration_workflow projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us/workflows/ WORKFLOW_ID
To list all your translation jobs, run the following command:
bq ls --migration_workflow --location = LOCATION
Explore the translation output
After running the translation job, you can see information about the job
in the Google Cloud console. If you used the Google Cloud console to run the job, you can see job results in the destination
Cloud Storage bucket that you specified. If you used the batch
translation client to run the job, you can see job results in the output
directory that you specified. The batch SQL translator
outputs the following files to the specified destination:
The translated files.
The translation summary report in CSV format.
The consumed output name mapping in JSON format.
The AI suggestion files.
Google Cloud console output

Consumed output name mapping file
This JSON file contains the output name mapping rules that were used by the
translation job. The rules in this file might differ from the
output name mapping rules
that you specified for the translation job, due to either conflicts in the
name mapping rules, or lack of name mapping rules for SQL objects
that were identified during translation. Review this file to
determine whether the name mapping rules
need correction. If they do, create new output name mapping rules that address
any issues you identify, and run a new translation job.
Translated files
For each source file, a corresponding output file is generated in the
destination path. The output file contains the translated query.
Important: Translation is done on a best effort basis. Whenever possible,
validate the translated queries.
Debug batch translated SQL queries with the interactive SQL translator
You can use the BigQuery interactive SQL translator to
review or debug a SQL query using the same metadata or object mapping
information as your source database. After you complete a batch translation job,
BigQuery generates a translation configuration ID that contains
information about the job's metadata, the object mapping, or the schema search
path, as applicable to the query.
You use the batch translation configuration ID with the interactive SQL translator
to run SQL queries with the specified configuration.
To start an interactive SQL translation by using a batch translation
configuration ID, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the SQL Translation page.
Go to SQL Translation
In the list of translation jobs, locate the job that you are interested in,
and then click more_vert More Options
> Open Interactive Translation .
The BigQuery interactive SQL translator now opens
with the corresponding batch translation configuration ID. To view the
translation configuration ID for the interactive translation, click
More > Translation settings in the
interactive SQL translator.
To debug a batch translation file in the interactive SQL translator,
follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the SQL Translation page.
Go to SQL Translation
In the list of translation jobs, locate the job that you are interested in,
and then click the job name or click More options > Show details .
In the Translation details window, click the Code tab.
In the file explorer, click your filename to open the file.
Next to the output filename, click Edit to open the files in the
interactive SQL translator ( Preview ).
You see the input and output files populated in the
interactive SQL translator that now uses the corresponding batch
translation configuration ID.
To save the edited output file back to Cloud Storage, in the
interactive SQL translator click Save > Save To GCS .
Limitations
The translator can't translate user-defined functions (UDFs) from languages
other than SQL, because it can't parse them to determine
their input and output data types. This causes translation of SQL statements
that reference these UDFs to be inaccurate. To make sure non-SQL UDFs are
properly referenced during translation, use valid SQL to create placeholder
UDFs with the same signatures.
For example, say you have a UDF written in C that calculates the sum of two
integers. To make sure that SQL statements that reference this UDF are correctly
translated, create a placeholder SQL UDF that shares the same signature as the
C UDF, as shown in the following example:
CREATE FUNCTION Test . MySum ( a INT , b INT )
RETURNS INT
LANGUAGE SQL
RETURN a + b ;
Save this placeholder UDF in a text file, and include that file as one of the
source files for the translation job. This enables the translator to learn the
UDF definition and identify the expected input and output data types.
Quota and limits
BigQuery Migration API quotas apply.
Each project can have at most 10 active translation tasks.
While there is no hard limit on the total number of source and metadata
files, we recommend keeping the number of files to under 1000 for better
performance.
Troubleshoot translation errors
RelationNotFound or AttributeNotFound translation issues
After translating a querying using the batch SQL translator , you might encounter a failed translation with the RelationNotFound or AttributeNotFound error.
You can find failed translations by navigating to the Translation details page and opening the Log Messages tab.
Translation works best with metadata DDLs. When SQL object definitions cannot be
found, the translation engine raises RelationNotFound or AttributeNotFound
issues. We recommend using the metadata extractor to generate metadata packages
to make sure all object definitions are present. Adding metadata is the
recommended first step to resolve most translation errors, as it often can fix
many other errors that are indirectly caused from a lack of metadata.
For more information, see Generate metadata for translation and assessment .
