Analyze multimodal data in BigQuery
This document describes the BigQuery features that you can use to
create and analyze multimodal data. These features can be used in
BigQuery with GoogleSQL and with Python by using
BigQuery DataFrames .
BigQuery's multimodal data features let you perform the
following tasks:
Integrate unstructured data stored in Cloud Storage as another column
alongside structured data in standard BigQuery tables by
representing unstructured data as ObjectRef values.
Generate annotations, embeddings, and scalar values from multimodal data by
using BigQuery ML generative AI functions
with Gemini models.
Generate annotations, embeddings, and scalar values from multimodal data by
creating multimodal DataFrames in
BigQuery DataFrames and using Python libraries.
For a step-by-step tutorial that uses the Google Cloud console, see
Analyze multimodal data with SQL and Python .
Benefits
BigQuery's multimodal data features offer the following benefits:
Composability : you can store and manage structured and unstructured data
in the same standard table row by using ObjectRef values. For example, you
could store images for a product in the same row as the rest of the product
information. You can use standard SQL functions to create and update
columns that contain ObjectRef values, and you can create
ObjectRef values as the output of a transformation action on an object.
Add multiple pieces of unstructured data in generative AI prompts :
add multiple ObjectRef
values as input to generative AI functions. For example, you can generate
embeddings of image and text data from the same table. For text and scalar
value generation, you can also refer to multiple objects within the prompt
that you send to a model. For example, you could create a prompt that asks the
model to generate a product description based on images and attributes of
the product.
Persisting chunk ordering : you can chunk objects and then store the chunks
as an array of ObjectRef values in a standard table column, in order to
persist their order. For example, you could parse images from a video, and
then store these images as an array of ObjectRef values, so that the images
stay in the same order that they appear in the original video.
ObjectRef values
An ObjectRef value is a STRUCT value that uses the
ObjectRef schema .
You can store Cloud Storage object metadata and an
associated authorizer in a
BigQuery standard table
by creating a STRUCT or ARRAY<STRUCT> column that uses this format.
The authorizer value identifies the
Cloud resource connection
that BigQuery uses to access the Cloud Storage object.
If you set the authorizer to NULL , then BigQuery uses your
end-user credentials.
Use ObjectRef values when you need to integrate unstructured data into a
standard table. For example, in a products table, you could store product images
in the same row with the rest of the product information by adding a column
containing an ObjectRef value.
Create and update ObjectRef values by using the following
GoogleSQL functions:
OBJ.MAKE_REF :
create an ObjectRef value that contains metadata for a
Cloud Storage object.
OBJ.FETCH_METADATA :
fetch Cloud Storage metadata for an ObjectRef value that
is partially populated with uri and authorizer values.
For more information, see
Work with ObjectRef values .
ObjectRefRuntime values
An ObjectRefRuntime value is a JSON value that uses the
ObjectRefRuntime schema .
An ObjectRefRuntime value contains the Cloud Storage object metadata
from the ObjectRef value that was used to create it, an associated authorizer,
and access URLs. You can use the access URLs to read or modify the object in
Cloud Storage.
Use ObjectRefRuntime values to work with object data in analysis and
transformation workflows. The access URLs in ObjectRefRuntime values expire
after 6 hours at most, although you can configure shorter expiration time. If
you persist ObjectRefRuntime values anywhere as part of your workflow, you
should refresh this data regularly. To persist object metadata, store
ObjectRef values instead, and then use them to generate ObjectRefRuntime
values when you need them. ObjectRef values don't need to be refreshed unless
the underlying objects in Cloud Storage are modified.
Create ObjectRefRuntime values by using the
OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL function .
Generative AI functions
Generate text, embeddings, and scalar values based on ObjectRef or
ObjectRefRuntime input by using the following generative AI functions with
Gemini models:
AI.GENERATE
AI.GENERATE_TEXT
AI.GENERATE_TABLE
AI.GENERATE_BOOL
AI.GENERATE_DOUBLE
AI.GENERATE_INT
AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING
AI.EMBED
AI.SIMILARITY
AI.CLASSIFY
AI.IF
AI.SCORE
Work with multimodal data in Python
You can analyze multimodal data in Python by using BigQuery DataFrames
classes and methods.
Multimodal DataFrames
Create a multimodal DataFrame that integrates structured and unstructured data
by using the
read_gbq method :
create a multimodal DataFrame from an object table.
To try it out, see the
Multimodal Dataframes tutorial
on GitHub.
Generative AI methods
Use the following methods to perform generative AI tasks on multimodal data:
predict method
of the
GeminiTextGenerator class :
generate text based on multimodal data.
predict method
of the
MultimodalEmbeddingGenerator class :
generate embeddings based on multimodal data.
Object tables
Any new
object tables that
you create have a ref column that contains an ObjectRef value for the
given object. The connection that is used to create the object table is used
to populate the authorizer values in the ref column. You can use the
ref column to populate and refresh ObjectRef values in standard tables.
Storage Insights datasets
A Storage Insights dataset is a linked
BigQuery dataset that
you can query to analyze and visualize your Cloud Storage data. The
ref column
contains ObjectRef values that you can use to
analyze object data and metadata .
Limitations
The following limitations apply to BigQuery multimodal data
features:
If you don't explicitly specify the name of the project that contains the
connection in the authorizer field of an ObjectRef value, then the
connection must exist either in the project that contains the object table
that stores it, or in the project in which the query that references the
ObjectRef value is run.
You can't have more than 20 Cloud resource connections in the project and
region where your query accesses object data as ObjectRef values.
You can reference ObjectRef values from at most five projects besides the
project in which you run the query.
Costs
The following costs are applicable when using multimodal data:
Storage of object metadata as ObjectRef values in standard tables
contributes to the BigQuery storage cost for the table.
Queries run on ObjectRef values incur BigQuery compute costs.
New objects that you create from object transformations incur
Cloud Storage costs.
New data that you create and persist in
BigQuery incurs BigQuery storage costs.
Use of generative AI functions incurs Vertex AI costs.
Use of BigQuery Python UDFs, and of multimodal DataFrames and
object transformations methods in BigQuery DataFrames, incurs
Python UDF costs.
