Migrate Hive managed tables to Google Cloud
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Note: To get support or provide feedback for this feature, contact bigquery-permission-migration-support@google.com .
This document shows you how to migrate your Hive managed tables to Google Cloud.
You can use the Hive managed tables migration connector in
the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to seamlessly migrate your tables managed by Hive metastore, supporting both Hive and Iceberg formats from on-premises and cloud environments to Google Cloud. The Hive managed tables migration connector supports files stored in the following data sources:
HDFS
Amazon S3
Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
With the Hive managed tables migration connector, you can register your Hive managed tables with Dataproc Metastore or BigLake metastore Iceberg REST Catalog while using Cloud Storage as the file storage.
This connector supports both full and metadata-only transfers. Full transfers will transfer both your data and metadata from your source tables to your target metastore. You can make a metadata-only transfer if you already have your data migrated to Cloud Storage.
The following diagram provides an overview of the table migration process from Hadoop cluster.
Limitations
Hive managed tables transfers are subject to the following
limitations:
To migrate Apache Iceberg tables, you must register the tables with the BigLake metastore Iceberg REST catalog to allow write access for open-source engines (such as Apache Spark or Flink).
To migrate Hive managed tables, you must register the tables with Dataproc Metastore to allow write access for open-source engines, and to allow read access for BigQuery.
File names must comply with Cloud Storage object naming requirements .
Storage Transfer Service has specific behaviors if data is changed at the source while a transfer is in progress. We don't recommend writing to tables while the table is being actively migrated.
Cloud Storage has a 5 TiB limit for single objects. Files within your Apache Hive tables larger than 5 TiB will fail to transfer.
For a list of other limitations, see Storage Transfer Service Known Limitations .
Quotas and concurrency limits
When you migrate data from Hive managed tables, Storage Transfer Service quotas and limits apply. For more information, see Quotas & Limits .
Before you begin
Before you schedule Hive managed tables transfer, you must
perform the following:
Generate metadata file for Apache Hive
Run the dwh-migration-dumper tool to extract metadata
for Apache Hive. The tool generates a file named hive-dumper-output.zip
to a Cloud Storage bucket, referred to in this document as DUMPER_BUCKET .
Enable APIs
Enable the following APIs in your
Google Cloud project:
Data Transfer API
Storage Transfer API
A service agent is
created when you enable the Data Transfer API.
Configure permissions
Create a service account and grant it the BigQuery Admin role ( roles/bigquery.admin ).
This service account is used to create the transfer configuration.
A service agent (P4SA) is created upon enabling the Data Transfer API. Grant
it the following roles:
roles/metastore.metadataOwner
roles/storagetransfer.admin
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer
roles/storage.objectAdmin
roles/storage.admin
If you are migrating metadata to BigLake metastore Iceberg REST Catalog, you must also grant the roles/biglake.admin role.
Grant the service agent the roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role with
the following command:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding SERVICE_ACCOUNT --member serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-bigquerydatatransfer.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
Grant the Storage Transfer Service service agent ( project-<var>PROJECT_NUMBER</var>@storage-transfer-service.iam.gserviceaccount.com ) the following roles in the project:
roles/storage.admin
If you are migrating from HDFS, you must also grant the roles/storagetransfer.serviceAgent role.
You can also configure more granular permissions. For more information, see the source-specific permissions guides:
HDFS permissions
Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure permissions
Configure your Storage Transfer Agent for HDFS data lakes
Required when the file is stored in HDFS. To set up the storage transfer agent
required for an HDFS data lake transfer, do the following:
Install Docker on
on-premises agent machines.
Create a Storage Transfer Service agent pool
in your Google Cloud project.
Install agents
on your on-premises agent machines.
Configure Storage Transfer Service permissions for Amazon S3
Required when the file is stored in Amazon S3. Transfers from Amazon S3 are agentless transfers, which require specific permissions.
To configure the Storage Transfer Service for a Amazon S3 transfer, do the following:
Set up access credentials for AWS Amazon S3 .
Note the access key ID and secret access key after setting up your access
credentials.
Add IP ranges used by Storage Transfer Service workers to
your list of allowed IPs if your AWS project uses IP restrictions.
Configure Storage Transfer Service permissions for Microsoft Azure Storage
Required when the file is stored in Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Transfers from Microsoft Azure Storage are agentless transfers, which require specific permissions.
To configure the Storage Transfer Service for a Microsoft Azure Storage transfer, do the following:
Generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token for your Microsoft Azure storage account.
Note the SAS token after generating it.
Add IP ranges used by Storage Transfer Service workers to
your list of allowed IPs if your Microsoft Azure storage account uses IP restrictions.

Run this command to create the transfer configuration and start the Hive managed tables
transfer. Transfers are scheduled to run
every 24 hours by default, but can be configured with transfer scheduling options .
When the transfer is complete, your tables in Hadoop cluster will be
migrated to MIGRATION_BUCKET .
Data ingestion options
The following sections provide more information about how you can configure your
Hive managed tables transfers.
Incremental transfers
When a transfer configuration is set up with a recurring schedule, every
subsequent transfer updates the table on Google Cloud with the latest updates
made to the source table. For example, all insert, delete, or update operations
with schema changes are reflected in Google Cloud with each transfer.
Transfer scheduling options
By default, transfers are scheduled to
run every 24 hours by default. To configure how often transfers are run,
add the --schedule flag to the transfer configuration, and specify a transfer
schedule using the schedule syntax .
Hive managed tables transfers must have a minimum of 24 hours
between transfer runs.
For one-time transfers, you can add the
end_time flag to the transfer configuration to only run the
transfer once.
Filter partitions
You can transfer a subset of partitions from your Hive
managed tables by providing a custom filter JSON file stored in
Cloud Storage. When scheduling the transfer, supply the full
Cloud Storage path to this JSON file using the partition_filter_gcs_path
parameter.
The following is an example of the filter JSON file structure:
{
"filters" : [
{
"table" : "db1.table1" ,
"condition" : "IN" ,
"partition" : [ "partition1=value1/partition2=value2" ]
},
{
"table" : "db1.table2" ,
"condition" : "LESS_THAN" ,
"partition" : [ "partition1;value1" ]
},
{
"table" : "db1.table3" ,
"condition" : "GREATER_THAN" ,
"partition" : [ "partition1;value1" ]
},
{
"table" : "db1.table4" ,
"condition" : "RANGE" ,
"partition" : [ "partition1;value1;value2" ]
}
]
}
Filter conditions
The condition field in the JSON file supports the following values, each with
a specific format for the partition array:
IN : Specifies the exact partition paths to include. The partition
array contains strings representing the exact directory structure of the
partitions relative to the table base path (for example,
["partition_key1=value1/partition_key2=value2"] ). You can specify multiple
paths in the array.
LESS_THAN : Includes partitions where the primary partition key value
is less than or equal to the specified value. The partition array must
contain a single string in the format ["<partition_key>;<value>"] .
GREATER_THAN : Includes partitions where the primary partition key
value is greater than or equal to the specified value. The partition array
must contain a single string in the format ["<partition_key>;<value>"] .
RANGE : Includes partitions where the primary partition key value
falls within the specified range (inclusive). The partition array must
contain a single string in the format
["<partition_key>;<start_value>;<end_value>"] .
The filter conditions are subject to the following rules and restrictions:
Inclusive values: Filter conditions for GREATER_THAN , LESS_THAN , and
RANGE are inclusive of the values provided. For example, a LESS_THAN
filter with a value of 2023 includes partitions up to and including 2023 .
Partition deletion: If an existing destination partition satisfies the
partition filter and is no longer present at the source, then it is dropped
from the destination metastore. However, the underlying data files for that
partition aren't deleted from the Cloud Storage destination bucket.
Single table restrictions:
Multiple filters on the same table aren't allowed.
You can't mix different condition types (for example: GREATER_THAN and
IN ) on the same table.
Target partition column: Filter conditions like GREATER_THAN ,
LESS_THAN , and RANGE must target the primary partition column.
Prefix limitations: The specified filter combination must not resolve to
more than 1000 prefixes per table. For example, a filter like year>2020 on
a table partitioned by year/month/day must result in fewer than 1000
unique year= prefixes.
Configure Translation output
You can configure a unique Cloud Storage path and database for each migrated table. To do so, perform the following steps to generate a tables mapping YAML file that you can use in your transfer configuration.
Create a configuration YAML file (suffixed with config.yaml ) in the DUMPER_BUCKET that contains the following:
type : object_rewriter
relation :
- match :
relationRegex : ".*"
external :
location_expression : "'gs:// MIGRATION_BUCKET /' + table.schema + '/' + table.name"
Replace MIGRATION_BUCKET with the name of the Cloud Storage bucket that is the destination for your migrated table files. The location_expression field is a common expression language (CEL) expression.
Create another configuration YAML file (suffixed with config.yaml ) in the DUMPER_BUCKET that contains the following:
type : experimental_object_rewriter
relation :
- match :
schema : SOURCE_DATABASE
outputName :
database : null
schema : TARGET_DATABASE
Replace SOURCE_DATABASE and TARGET_DATABASE with the source database's name and Dataproc Metastore database or BigQuery dataset depending on the chosen metastore. Ensure that the BigQuery dataset exists if you are configuring the database for BigLake metastore.
For more information about these configuration YAML, see Guidelines to create a configuration YAML file .
Generate tables mapping YAML file using the following command:
curl -d '{
"tasks": {
"string": {
"type": "HiveQL2BigQuery_Translation",
"translation_details": {
"target_base_uri": " TRANSLATION_OUTPUT_BUCKET ",
"source_target_mapping": {
"source_spec": {
"base_uri": " DUMPER_BUCKET "
}
},
"target_types": ["metadata"]
}
}
}
}' \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " -X POST https://bigquerymigration.googleapis.com/v2alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /workflows
Replace the following:
TRANSLATION_OUTPUT_BUCKET : (Optional) Specify a Cloud Storage
bucket for the translation output. For more information, see Using Translation output .
DUMPER_BUCKET : the base URI for Cloud Storage bucket
that contains the hive-dumper-output.zip and configuration YAML file.
TOKEN : the OAuth token. You can generate this in the
command line with the command gcloud auth print-access-token .
PROJECT_ID : the project to process the translation.
LOCATION : the location where the job is processed. For example, eu or us .
Monitor the status of this job . When completed, a mapping file is generated for each table in a database within a predefined path in TRANSLATION_OUTPUT_BUCKET .
Orchestrate dumper execution by using the cron command
You can automate incremental transfers by using a cron job to execute the dwh-migration-dumper tool. By automating metadata extraction, you ensure that an up-to-date dump from Hadoop is available for subsequent incremental transfer runs.
Before you begin
Before using this automation script, you must do the following:
Complete all dumper installation prerequisites , including installing the dwh-migration-dumper tool and configuring IAM permissions.
Install the Google Cloud CLI . The script uses the gsutil command-line tool to upload dumper output to Cloud Storage.
Authenticate with Google Cloud to allow gsutil to upload files to Cloud Storage with the following command:
gcloud auth application-default login
Scheduling the automation
Save the following script to a local file. This script is designed to be configured and executed by a cron daemon to automate the extraction and upload process of dumper output:
#!/bin/bash
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e
# Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
set -u
# Pipelines return the exit status of the last command to exit with a non-zero status.
set -o pipefail
# These values are used if not overridden by command-line options.

Run the following command to make the script executable:
chmod +x PATH_TO_SCRIPT
Schedule the script using crontab , replacing the variables with appropriate
values for your job. Add an entry to schedule the job.
The following examples run the script every day at 2:30 AM:
If you are running on a host that has direct access to Apache Hive and does not
require Kerberos authentication, use the following command:
Without Kerberos authentication
# Run the Hive dumper daily at 2 :30 AM for incremental BigQuery transfer.
30 2 * * * PATH_TO_SCRIPT
--dumper-executable PATH_TO_DUMPER_EXECUTABLE
--gcs-base-path GCS_PATH_TO_UPLOAD_DUMPER_OUTPUT
--local-base-dir LOCAL_PATH_TO_SAVE_INTERMEDIARY_FILES
If your Apache Hive instance requires Kerberos authentication, use the following
command:
With Kerberos authentication
# Run the Hive dumper daily at 2 :30 AM for incremental BigQuery transfer with Kerberos authentication.
30 2 * * * PATH_TO_SCRIPT
--dumper-executable PATH_TO_DUMPER_EXECUTABLE
--gcs-base-path GCS_PATH_TO_UPLOAD_DUMPER_OUTPUT
--local-base-dir LOCAL_PATH_TO_SAVE_INTERMEDIARY_FILES
--kerberos-authentication
--host HIVE_HOST
--port HIVE_PORT
--hive-kerberos-url HIVE_KERBEROS_URL
--hiveql-rpc-protection HIVEQL_RPC_PROTECTION
When creating the transfer, ensure the table_metadata_path field is set to
the same Cloud Storage path you configured for GCS_PATH_TO_UPLOAD_DUMPER_OUTPUT .
This is the path containing the dumper output ZIP files.
Scheduling Considerations
To avoid data staleness, the metadata dump must be ready before your scheduled
transfer begins. Configure the cron job frequency accordingly.
We recommend performing a few trial runs of the script manually to determine the
average time it takes for the dumper tool to generate its output. Use this
timing to set a cron schedule that safely precedes your DTS transfer run and
ensures freshness.
Monitor and view transfer status
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Note: To get support or provide feedback for this feature, contact dts-preview-support@google.com .
You can monitor resource-level transfers for individual tables to track
progress, view granular error details, and query the state of specific
resources being migrated.
To view the progress and status of your resources, select one of the
following options:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Data transfers page.
Go to Data transfers
Click your transfer configuration from the list.
On the Transfer details page, click the Tables transferred tab.
View the list of resources being transferred. You can see details like the
following:
Last transfer status : the current state of the resource based on
the latest resource transfer, including completion progress.
Table name : the name of the resource being transferred. Click the
resource name to see a detailed view of the resource.
Latest run : the last transfer run that updated the resource.
Status summary : granular progress metrics or error messages if the
transfer failed.
Last successful run : the last run that successfully transferred the
resource.
Use the filter bar to search for specific resources by name or filter by
their current status, for example, Failed transfers . The Table name
filter supports wildcard matching—for example, using * —but wildcard
matching isn't supported for other filter fields.
API
You can query the status of transfer resources using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service API.
List all resources and their statuses
To list all resources and their statuses, use the
projects.locations.transferConfigs.transferResources.list method .
Run the API request with the following information:
GET https://bigquerydatatransfer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /transferConfigs/ CONFIG_ID /transferResources
Example Response (abridged) (JSON):
{
"transferResources": [
{
"name": "projects/.../transferResources/table1",
"latestStatusDetail": {
"state": "RESOURCE_TRANSFER_SUCCEEDED",
"completedPercentage": 100.0
},
"updateTime": "2026-02-03T22:42:06Z"
}
]
}
curl command:
curl -X GET
"https://bigquerydatatransfer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /transferConfigs/ CONFIG_ID /transferResources"
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) "
-H "Accept: application/json"
You can filter the results by resource name or state. For example, to find
all failed transfers, add
?filter=latest_status_detail.state="RESOURCE_TRANSFER_FAILED"
to the request URL.
Replace the following:
CONFIG_ID : the ID of the transfer configuration.
LOCATION : the location where the transfer
configuration was created.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project that's
running the transfers.
Get a specific resource
To get the status of a specific table or partition, use the
projects.locations.transferConfigs.transferResources.get method .
Run the API request with the following information:
GET h tt ps : //bigquerydatatransfer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /transferConfigs/ CONFIG_ID /transferResources/ RESOURCE_ID
curl command:
curl -X GET
"https://bigquerydatatransfer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /transferConfigs/ CONFIG_ID /transferResources/ RESOURCE_ID "
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) "
-H "Accept: application/json"
Replace the following:
CONFIG_ID : the ID of the transfer
configuration.
LOCATION : the location where the transfer
configuration was created.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project
that's running the transfers.
RESOURCE_ID : the ID of the resource, for example,
the table name.
