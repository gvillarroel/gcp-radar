CAPACITY_COMMITMENTS view
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CAPACITY_COMMITMENTS view contains a near real-time
list of all current capacity commitments within the administration project. Each
row represents a single, current capacity commitment. A current capacity
commitment is either pending or active and has not been deleted. For more
information about reservation, see Slot commitments .
Note: The view names INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CAPACITY_COMMITMENTS and
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CAPACITY_COMMITMENTS_BY_PROJECT are synonymous and can be
used interchangeably.
Required permission
To query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CAPACITY_COMMITMENTS view,
you need the bigquery.capacityCommitments.list Identity and Access Management (IAM)
permission for the project.
Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the required
permission:
roles/bigquery.resourceAdmin
roles/bigquery.resourceEditor
roles/bigquery.resourceViewer
roles/bigquery.user
roles/bigquery.admin
For more information about BigQuery permissions, see
Access control with IAM
Schema
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CAPACITY_COMMITMENTS view has the
following schema:
Column name
Data type
Value
ddl
STRING
The DDL statement used to create this capacity commitment.
project_id
STRING
ID of the administration project.
project_number
INTEGER
Number of the administration project.
capacity_commitment_id
STRING
ID that uniquely identifies the capacity commitment.
commitment_plan
STRING
Commitment plan of the capacity commitment.
state
STRING
State the capacity commitment is in. Can be PENDING or
ACTIVE .
slot_count
INTEGER
Slot count associated with the capacity commitment.
edition
STRING
The edition associated with this reservation. For more information about editions, see Introduction to BigQuery editions .
is_flat_rate
BOOL
Whether the commitment is associated with the legacy flat-rate capacity model or an edition. If FALSE , the current commitment is associated with an edition. If TRUE , the commitment is the legacy flat-rate capacity model.
renewal_plan
STRING
New commitment plan after the end of current commitment plan. You can change the renewal plan for a commitment at any time until it expires.
For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of
using a wildcard ( SELECT * ). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from
breaking if the underlying schema changes.
Scope and syntax
Queries against this view must include a region qualifier .
If you don't specify a regional qualifier, metadata is retrieved from all
regions. The following table explains the region scope for this view:
View name
Resource scope
Region scope
[ PROJECT_ID .]`region- REGION `.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CAPACITY_COMMITMENTS[_BY_PROJECT]
Project level
REGION
Replace the following:
Optional: PROJECT_ID : the ID of your
Google Cloud project. If not specified, the default project is used.
REGION : any dataset region name .
For example, `region-us` .
Note: You must use a region qualifier
to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. The location of the query
execution must match the region of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA view.
Example
The following example returns a list of active capacity commitments for the
current project:
SELECT
capacity_commitment_id ,
slot_count
FROM
`region-us` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . CAPACITY_COMMITMENTS
WHERE
state = 'ACTIVE' ;
The result is similar to the following:
+------------------------+------------+
| capacity_commitment_id | slot_count |
+------------------------+------------+
| my_commitment_05 | 1000 |
| my_commitment_06 | 1000 |
| my_commitment_07 | 1500 |
| my_commitment_08 | 2000 |
+------------------------+------------+
