ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES view
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES view contains a near real-time list
of all changes to assignments within the administration project. Each row
represents a single change to a single assignment. For more information about
reservation, see Introduction to Reservations .
Note: The view names INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES and
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES_BY_PROJECT are synonymous and can be
used interchangeably.
Required permission
To query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES view, you need the
bigquery.reservationAssignments.list Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission for
the project.
Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the required
permission:
roles/bigquery.resourceAdmin
roles/bigquery.resourceEditor
roles/bigquery.resourceViewer
roles/bigquery.user
roles/bigquery.admin
For more information about BigQuery permissions, see
Access control with IAM .
Schema
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES view has the following
schema:
Column name
Data type
Value
change_timestamp
TIMESTAMP
Time when the change occurred.
project_id
STRING
ID of the administration project.
project_number
INTEGER
Number of the administration project.
assignment_id
STRING
ID that uniquely identifies the assignment.
reservation_name
STRING
Name of the reservation that the assignment uses.
job_type
STRING
The type of job that can use the reservation. Can be
PIPELINE or QUERY .
assignee_id
STRING
ID that uniquely identifies the assignee resource.
assignee_number
INTEGER
Number that uniquely identifies the assignee resource.
assignee_type
STRING
Type of assignee resource. Can be organization ,
folder or project .
action
STRING
Type of event that occurred with the assignment. Can be
CREATE , UPDATE , or DELETE .
user_email
STRING
Email address of the user or subject of the workforce identity
federation that made the change. google for changes
made by Google. NULL if the email address is unknown.
state
STRING
State of the assignment. Can be PENDING or
ACTIVE .
For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of
using a wildcard ( SELECT * ). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from
breaking if the underlying schema changes.
Data retention
This view contains current assignments and deleted assignments that are
kept for a maximum of 41 days after which they are removed from the view.
Scope and syntax
Queries against this view must include a region qualifier .
If you don't specify a regional qualifier, metadata is retrieved from all
regions. The following table explains the region scope for this view:
View name
Resource scope
Region scope
[ PROJECT_ID .]`region- REGION `.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES[_BY_PROJECT]
Project level
REGION
Replace the following:
Optional: PROJECT_ID : the ID of your
Google Cloud project. If not specified, the default project is used.
REGION : any dataset region name .
For example, `region-us` .
Note: You must use a region qualifier
to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. The location of the query
execution must match the region of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA view.
Examples
Find the latest changes to an assignment
The following example displays the user who has made the latest assignment
update to a particular assignment within a specified date.
SELECT
user_email ,
change_timestamp ,
reservation_name ,
assignment_id
FROM
`region-us` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES
WHERE
change_timestamp BETWEEN '2021-09-30' AND '2021-10-01'
AND assignment_id = 'assignment_01'
ORDER BY
change_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 1 ;
The result is similar to the following:
+--------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+-----------------+
| user_email | change_timestamp | reservation_name | assignment_id |
+--------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+-----------------+
| cloudysanfrancisco@gmail.com |2021-09-30 09:30:00 UTC| my_reservation | assignment_01 |
+--------------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+-----------------+
Identify the assignment status of a reservation at a specific point in time
The following example displays all of the active assignments of a reservation at
a certain point in time.
SELECT
reservation_name ,
assignee_id ,
assignee_type ,
job_type
FROM
`region- REGION ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES
WHERE
reservation_name = RESERVATION_NAME
AND change_timestamp TIMESTAMP
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER () OVER ( PARTITION BY assignee_id , job_type ORDER BY change_timestamp DESC ) = 1
AND action != 'DELETE' ;
Replace the following:
REGION : the region where your reservation is located
RESERVATION_NAME : the name of the reservation that the assignment uses
TIMESTAMP : the timestamp representing the specific point in time at which the list of assignments is checked
The result is similar to the following:
+-------------------------+---------------------------+---------------+----------+
| reservation_name | assignee_id | assignee_type | job_type |
+-------------------------+---------------------------+---------------+----------+
| test-reservation | project_1 | PROJECT | QUERY |
| test-reservation | project_2 | PROJECT | QUERY |
+-------------------------+---------------------------+---------------+----------+
Identify the assignment status of a reservation when a particular job was executed
To display the assignments that were active when a certain job was executed,
use the following example.
SELECT
reservation_name ,
assignee_id ,
assignee_type ,
job_type
FROM
`region- REGION ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . ASSIGNMENT_CHANGES
WHERE
reservation_name = RESERVATION_NAME
AND change_timestamp ( SELECT creation_time FROM PROJECT_ID . `region- REGION ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . JOBS WHERE job_id = JOB_ID )
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER () OVER ( PARTITION BY assignee_id , job_type ORDER BY change_timestamp DESC ) = 1
AND action != 'DELETE' ;
Replace the following:
REGION : the region where your reservation is located
RESERVATION_NAME : the name of the reservation that the assignment uses
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project where the job was executed
JOB_ID : the job ID against which the assignment status was checked
