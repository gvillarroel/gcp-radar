Introduction to Cloud Storage transfers
The BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Cloud Storage lets you schedule recurring
data loads from Cloud Storage buckets to
BigQuery. The path to the data stored in Cloud Storage and
the destination table can both be
parameterized ,
allowing you to load data from Cloud Storage buckets organized by date.
Supported file formats
The BigQuery Data Transfer Service supports loading data
from Cloud Storage in one of the following formats:
Comma-separated values (CSV)
JSON (newline-delimited)
Avro
Parquet
ORC
Supported compression types
The BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Cloud Storage supports loading compressed data.
The compression types supported by BigQuery Data Transfer Service are the same as the
compression types supported by BigQuery load jobs. For more
information, see
Loading compressed and uncompressed data .
Data ingestion for Cloud Storage transfers
You can specify how data is loaded into BigQuery by selecting a
Write Preference in the transfer configuration when you
set up a Cloud Storage transfer .
There are two types of write preferences available, incremental transfers
and truncated transfers .
Incremental transfers
A transfer configuration with an APPEND or WRITE_APPEND write
preference, also called an incremental transfer, incrementally appends new data
since the previous successful transfer to a BigQuery destination
table. When a transfer configuration runs with an APPEND write preference,
the
BigQuery Data Transfer Service filters for files which have been modified since the
previous successful transfer run. To determine when a file is modified,
BigQuery Data Transfer Service looks at the file metadata for a "last modified time"
property. For example, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service looks at the updated timestamp property
in a Cloud Storage file. If the
BigQuery Data Transfer Service finds any files with a "last modified time" that have
occurred after the timestamp of the last successful transfer, the
BigQuery Data Transfer Service transfers those files in an incremental transfer.
To demonstrate how incremental transfers work, consider the following
Cloud Storage transfer example. A user creates a file in a
Cloud Storage bucket at time 2023-07-01T00:00Z named file_1 . The
updated timestamp for file_1 is
the time that the file was created. The user then
creates an incremental transfer from the Cloud Storage bucket,
scheduled to run once daily at time 03:00Z, starting from 2023-07-01T03:00Z.
At 2023-07-01T03:00Z, the first transfer run starts. As this is the first
transfer run for this configuration, BigQuery Data Transfer Service attempts to
load all files matching the source URI into the destination
BigQuery table. The transfer run succeeds and
BigQuery Data Transfer Service successfully loads file_1 into the destination
BigQuery table.
The next transfer run, at 2023-07-02T03:00Z, detects no files where the
updated timestamp property is greater
than the last successful transfer run (2023-07-01T03:00Z). The transfer run
succeeds without loading any additional data into the destination
BigQuery table.
The preceding example shows how the BigQuery Data Transfer Service looks at the
updated timestamp property of the source file to determine if any changes were
made to the source files, and to transfer those changes if any were detected.
Following the same example, suppose that the user then creates another file in
the Cloud Storage bucket at time 2023-07-03T00:00Z, named file_2 . The
updated timestamp for file_2 is
the time that the file was created.
The next transfer run, at 2023-07-03T03:00Z, detects that file_2 has an
updated timestamp greater than the last successful transfer run
(2023-07-01T03:00Z). Suppose that when the transfer run starts it fails due to
a transient error. In this scenario, file_2 is not loaded into the
destination BigQuery table. The last successful transfer
run timestamp remains at 2023-07-01T03:00Z.
The next transfer run, at 2023-07-04T03:00Z, detects that file_2 has an
updated timestamp greater than the last successful transfer run
(2023-07-01T03:00Z). This time, the transfer run completes without issue, so
it successfully loads file_2 into the destination BigQuery table.
The next transfer run, at 2023-07-05T03:00Z, detects no files where the
updated timestamp is greater than the last successful transfer run
(2023-07-04T03:00Z). The transfer run succeeds without loading any additional
data into the destination BigQuery table.
The preceding example shows that when a transfer fails, no files are
transferred to the BigQuery destination table. Any file changes
are transferred at the next successful transfer run. Any subsequent
successful transfers following a failed transfer does not cause duplicate
data. In the case of a failed transfer, you can also choose to manually trigger a transfer
outside its regularly scheduled time.
Warning: BigQuery Data Transfer Service relies on the "last modified time" property in each source file
to determine which files to transfer, as seen in the incremental
transfer examples. Modifying these properties can cause the transfer to skip
certain files, or load the same file multiple times. This property can have
different names in each storage system supported by BigQuery Data Transfer Service.
For example, Cloud Storage objects call this property updated .
Truncated transfers
A transfer configuration with a MIRROR or WRITE_TRUNCATE write
preference, also called a truncated transfer, overwrites data in the
BigQuery destination table during each transfer run with data
from all files matching the source URI. MIRROR overwrites a fresh copy of
data in the destination table. If the destination table is using a partition
decorator, the transfer run only overwrites data in the specified partition. A
destination table with a partition decorator has the format
my_table${run_date} —for example, my_table$20230809 .
Repeating the same incremental or truncated transfers in a day does not cause
duplicate data. However, if you run multiple different transfer
configurations that affect the same BigQuery destination table,
this can cause the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to duplicate data.
Cloud Storage resource path
To load data from a Cloud Storage data source, you must provide the path to
the data.
The Cloud Storage resource path contains your bucket name and your
object (filename). For example, if the Cloud Storage bucket is named
mybucket and the data file is named myfile.csv , the resource path would be
gs://mybucket/myfile.csv .
BigQuery does not support Cloud Storage resource paths
that include multiple consecutive slashes after the initial double slash.
Cloud Storage object names can contain multiple consecutive slash ("/")
characters. However, BigQuery converts multiple consecutive
slashes into a single slash. For example, the following resource path, though
valid in Cloud Storage, does not work in BigQuery:
gs:// bucket /my//object//name .
To retrieve the Cloud Storage resource path:
Open the Cloud Storage console.
Cloud Storage console
Browse to the location of the object (file) that contains the source data.
Click on the name of the object.
The Object details page opens.
Copy the value provided in the gsutil URI field, which begins with
gs:// .
Note: You can also use the
gcloud storage ls command to list buckets
or objects.
Wildcard support for Cloud Storage resource paths
If your Cloud Storage data is separated into multiple files that share a
common base name, you can use a wildcard in the resource path when you load the
data.
To add a wildcard to the Cloud Storage resource path, you append an
asterisk (*) to the base name. For example, if you have two files named
fed-sample000001.csv and fed-sample000002.csv , the resource path would be
gs://mybucket/fed-sample* . This wildcard can then be used in the
Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI.
You can use multiple wildcards for objects (filenames) within buckets. The
wildcard can appear anywhere inside the object name.
Wildcards don't expand a directory in a gs://bucket/ . For example,
gs://bucket/dir/* finds files in the directory dir but doesn't find
files in the subdirectory gs://bucket/dir/subdir/ .
Neither can you match on prefixes without wildcards. For example,
gs://bucket/dir doesn't match on gs://bucket/dir/file.csv nor
gs://bucket/file.csv
However, you can use multiple wildcards for filenames within buckets.
For example, gs://bucket/dir/*/*.csv matches
gs://bucket/dir/subdir/file.csv .
For examples of wildcard support in combination with parameterized table names,
see
Runtime parameters in transfers .
Quotas and limits
The BigQuery Data Transfer Service uses load jobs to load Cloud Storage data into
BigQuery.
All BigQuery
quotas and limits on load jobs apply to recurring
Cloud Storage load jobs, with the following additional considerations:
Value
Limit
Maximum size per load job transfer run
15 TB
Maximum number of files per transfer run
10,000 files
Pricing
After data is transferred to BigQuery, standard
BigQuery storage and
query pricing applies.
For cross-location transfers from Cloud Storage, pricing is determined by the
location of the Cloud Storage bucket and the location of the destination
BigQuery dataset. For more information, see Data transfer within Google Cloud .
For more information about pricing, see BigQuery pricing .
