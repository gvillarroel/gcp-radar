Export a BigQuery ML model for online prediction
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: Exporting your models is not required for deployment on Vertex AI
if you are using the Vertex AI Model Registry. To learn more about the
registry, see
Manage BigQuery ML models in the Model Registry .
This tutorial shows how to export a BigQuery ML model
and then deploy the model either on Vertex AI or on a local machine. You will
use the iris table
from the BigQuery public datasets and work through the following three end-to-end scenarios:
Train and deploy a logistic regression model - also applies to DNN classifier, DNN regressor, k-means, linear regression, and matrix factorization models.
Train and deploy a boosted tree classifier model - also applies to boosted tree regressor model.
Train and deploy an AutoML classifier model - also applies to AutoML regressor model.

Delete your project
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
