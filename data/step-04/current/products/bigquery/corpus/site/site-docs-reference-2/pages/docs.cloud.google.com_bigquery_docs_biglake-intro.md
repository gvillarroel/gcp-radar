Introduction to BigLake external tables
Important: The term "BigLake" on this page refers to an access
delegation functionality for external tables in BigQuery. For
information about BigLake, the stand-alone Google Cloud
product that includes BigLake metastore, the Apache Iceberg REST catalog,
and BigLake tables for Apache Iceberg see
BigLake overview .
This document provides an overview of BigLake and assumes familiarity
with database tables and Identity and Access Management (IAM). To query data stored in the
supported data stores , you must first create
BigLake tables and then query them using GoogleSQL
syntax:
Create Cloud Storage BigLake tables
and then query .
Create Amazon S3 BigLake tables
and then query .
Create Azure Blob Storage BigLake tables
and then query .
You can also upgrade an external table to BigLake. For more
information, see Upgrade an external table to BigLake .
BigLake tables let you query structured data in
external data stores with access delegation. Access delegation
decouples access to the BigLake table from access to
the underlying data store. An
external connection
associated with a service account is used to connect to the data store. Because
the service account handles retrieving data from the data store, you only have
to grant users access to the BigLake table. This lets you enforce
fine-grained security at the table level, including
row-level and
column-level security. For
BigLake tables based on Cloud Storage, you can also use
dynamic data masking . To learn more about
multi-cloud analytic solutions using BigLake tables with
Amazon S3 or Blob Storage data, see
BigQuery Omni .
Supported data stores
You can use BigLake tables with the following data stores:
Amazon S3 by using
BigQuery Omni
Blob Storage by using
BigQuery Omni
Cloud Storage
Temporary table support
BigLake tables based on Cloud Storage can be temporary
or permanent. BigLake tables based on Amazon S3 or
Blob Storage must be permanent.
Multiple source files
You can create a BigLake table based on multiple external data
sources, provided those data sources have the same schema.
Cross-cloud joins
Cross-cloud joins let you run queries that span both Google Cloud and
BigQuery Omni regions. You can use
GoogleSQL JOIN operations
to analyze data across many different storage solutions, such as AWS, Azure,
public datasets, and other Google Cloud services. Cross-cloud joins
eliminate the need to copy data across sources before running queries.
You can reference BigLake tables anywhere in a SELECT statement
as if they were standard BigQuery tables, including in
data manipulation language (DML)
and data definition language (DDL)
statements that
use subqueries to retrieve data. You can use multiple BigLake
tables from different clouds and BigQuery tables in the same
query. All BigQuery tables must be from the same region.
Cross-cloud join required permissions
To get the permissions that
you need to run a cross-cloud join,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the project where the join is executed:
BigQuery Data Viewer ( roles/bigquery.dataViewer )
BigQuery Job User ( roles/bigquery.jobUser )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to run a cross-cloud join. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to run a cross-cloud join:
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.tables.getData
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Cross-cloud join costs
When you run a cross-cloud join operation, BigQuery parses the
query into local and remote parts. The local part is treated as a standard query
in the BigQuery region. The remote part is converted into a
CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) operation on the referenced
BigLake table in the BigQuery Omni region, which
creates a temporary table in your BigQuery region.
BigQuery then uses this temporary table to execute your
cross-cloud join and deletes the table automatically after eight hours.
You incur data transfer costs for data in the referenced BigLake
tables. However, BigQuery helps reduce these costs by only
transferring columns and rows in the BigLake table that are
referenced in the query, rather than the entire table. We recommend specifying a
column filter that is as narrow as possible to further reduce transfer costs.
The CTAS job appears in your job history and displays information such as the
number of transferred bytes. Successful transfers incur costs even if the main
query job fails. For more information, see
BigQuery Omni pricing .
Consider the following query as an example:
SELECT *
FROM bigquery_dataset . bigquery_table AS clients
WHERE clients . sales_rep IN (
SELECT id
FROM aws_dataset . aws_table1 AS employees
INNER JOIN aws_dataset . aws_table2 AS active_employees
ON employees . id = active_employees . id
WHERE employees . level > 3
);
This example has two transfers: one from an employees table (with a level
filter) and one from an active employees table. The join is performed in the
BigQuery region after the transfer occurs. If one transfer fails
and the other succeeds, data transfer charges are still applied for the
successful transfer.
Cross-cloud join limitations
Cross-cloud joins aren't supported in the BigQuery
free tier and in the
BigQuery sandbox .
Aggregations might not be pushed down to the BigQuery Omni
regions if the query contains JOIN statements.
Each temporary table is only used for a single cross-cloud query and is not
reused even if the same query is repeated multiple times.
The transfer size limit for each transfer is 60 GB. Specifically, if you apply
a filter on a BigLake table and load the result, it must be
smaller than 60 GB. If needed, you can
request a quota adjustment .
There is no limit on scanned bytes.
Cross-cloud join queries employ an internal quota on the rate of queries. If
the rate of queries exceeds the quota, you might receive an
All our servers are busy processing data transferred between regions error.
Retrying the query should work in most cases. Contact support to increase the
internal quota to support a higher rate of queries.
Cross-cloud joins are only supported in
colocated BigQuery regions
with their corresponding BigQuery Omni regions and in the US
and EU multi-regions. Cross-cloud joins that are run in the US or EU
multi-regions can only access data in US or EU BigQuery Omni
regions respectively.
If a cross-cloud join query references 10 or more datasets from
BigQuery Omni regions, it might fail with an error
Not found: Dataset <BigQuery dataset> was not found in
location <BigQuery Omni region> . To avoid this issue, we
recommend
explicitly specifying a location
when you run a cross-cloud join that references more than 10 datasets. Be
aware that if you explicitly specify a BigQuery region and your
query only contains BigLake tables, then your query is run as a
cross-cloud query and incurs data transfer costs.
You can't
query the _FILE_NAME pseudo-column
with cross-cloud joins.
When you reference the columns of a BigLake table in a WHERE
clause, you can't use INTERVAL or RANGE literals.
Cross-cloud join jobs don't report the number of bytes that are processed and
transferred from other clouds. This information is available in the child CTAS
jobs that are created as part of cross-cloud query execution.
Authorized views and
authorized routines referencing
BigQuery Omni tables or views are only supported in
BigQuery Omni regions.
If your cross-cloud query references STRUCT or JSON columns, no pushdowns
are applied to any remote subqueries. To optimize performance, consider
creating a view in the BigQuery Omni region that filters
STRUCT and JSON columns and returns only the necessary fields as
individual columns.
Collation isn't
supported by cross-cloud joins.
Cross-cloud joins don't support joining Omni views using the ORDER BY clause.
Cross-cloud join examples
The following query joins an orders table in a BigQuery region
with a lineitem table in a BigQuery Omni region:
SELECT
l_shipmode ,
o_orderpriority ,
count ( l_linenumber ) AS num_lineitems
FROM bigquery_dataset . orders
JOIN aws_dataset . lineitem
ON orders . o_orderkey = lineitem . l_orderkey
WHERE
l_shipmode IN ( 'AIR' , 'REG AIR' )
AND l_commitdate l_receiptdate
AND l_shipdate l_commitdate
AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1997-01-01'
AND l_receiptdate DATE '1997-02-01'
GROUP BY l_shipmode , o_orderpriority
ORDER BY l_shipmode , o_orderpriority ;
This query is broken into local and remote parts. The following query is sent to
the BigQuery Omni region to execute first. The result is a
temporary table in the BigQuery region. You can view this child
CTAS job and its metadata in your job history.
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE temp_table
AS (
SELECT
l_shipmode ,
l_linenumber ,
l_orderkey
FROM aws_dataset . lineitem
WHERE
l_shipmode IN ( 'AIR' , 'REG AIR' )
AND l_commitdate l_receiptdate
AND l_shipdate l_commitdate
AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1997-01-01'
AND l_receiptdate DATE '1997-02-01'
);
After the temporary table is created, the JOIN operation completes, and the
following query is run:
SELECT
l_shipmode ,
o_orderpriority ,
count ( l_linenumber ) AS num_lineitems
FROM bigquery_dataset . orders
JOIN temp_table
ON orders . o_orderkey = lineitem . l_orderkey
GROUP BY l_shipmode , o_orderpriority
ORDER BY l_shipmode , o_orderpriority ;
As another example, consider the following cross-cloud join:
SELECT c_mktsegment , c_name
FROM bigquery_dataset . customer
WHERE c_mktsegment = 'BUILDING'
UNION ALL
SELECT c_mktsegment , c_name
FROM aws_dataset . customer
WHERE c_mktsegment = 'FURNITURE'
LIMIT 10 ;
In this query, the LIMIT clause is not pushed down to the
BigQuery Omni region. All customers in the FURNITURE market
segment are transferred to the BigQuery region first, and then
the limit of 10 is applied.
Connectors
You can access data in BigLake tables based on
Cloud Storage from other data processing tools by using
BigQuery connectors.
For example, you could access data in BigLake tables from
Apache Spark ,
Apache Hive ,
TensorFlow ,
Trino , or
Presto .
The BigQuery Storage API enforces row- and column-level governance policies on all
data access to BigLake tables, including through connectors.
For example, the following diagram demonstrates how
the BigQuery Storage API
lets users access authorized data using open source query engines such as Apache
Spark:
For more information about connectors supported by BigQuery, see
BigQuery connectors .
BigLake tables on object stores
For data lake administrators, BigLake lets you set access
controls on tables rather than files, which gives you finer-grained options
when setting user access to data in the data lake.
Because BigLake tables simplifies access control in this way,
we recommend using BigLake tables to build and maintain
connections to external object stores.
You can use external tables in cases where
governance is not a requirement, or for ad hoc data discovery and manipulation.
Limitations
All
limitations for external tables
apply to BigLake tables.
BigLake tables on object stores are subject to the same
limitations as BigQuery tables. For more information, see
Quotas .
BigLake does not support downscoped credentials from
Managed Service for Apache Spark Personal Cluster Authentication .
As a workaround, to use clusters with Personal Cluster Authentication, you
must inject your credentials using an empty
Credential Access Boundary
with the --access-boundary=<(echo -n "{}") flag. For example, the following
command enables a credential propagation session in a project named
myproject for the cluster named mycluster :
gcloud dataproc clusters enable-personal-auth-session \
--region=us \
--project=myproject \
--access-boundary=<(echo -n "{}") \
mycluster
Caution: Using an empty credential access boundary removes
one layer of protection against attacks through stolen credentials from
Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters. Stolen credentials have a larger blast radius
without downscoping.
As an alternative, you can disable Personal Cluster Authentication
and use the Managed Service for Apache Spark virtual machine (VM) service account as a proxy for user groups.
BigLake tables are read-only. You cannot modify
BigLake tables using DML statements or other methods.
BigLake tables support the following formats:
Avro
CSV
Delta Lake
Iceberg
JSON
ORC
Parquet
You can't use
cached metadata
with
Apache Iceberg external tables ;
BigQuery already uses the
metadata that Iceberg captures in manifest files.
The BigQuery Storage API is not available
in other cloud environments, such as AWS and Azure.
If you use cached metadata ,
then the following limitations apply:
You can only use
cached metadata
with BigLake tables that use Avro, ORC,
Parquet, JSON, and CSV formats.
If you create, update, or delete files in Amazon S3, then
querying the files does not return the updated data until the next
refresh of the metadata cache. This can lead to unexpected results.
For example, if you delete a file and write a new file, your query
results may exclude both the old and the new files depending on when
cached metadata was last updated.
Using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) with cached metadata is not
supported for BigLake tables that reference
Amazon S3 or Blob Storage data.
Security model
The following organizational roles are typically involved in managing and
using BigLake tables:
Data lake administrators. These administrators typically manage
Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies on Cloud Storage buckets and
objects.
Data warehouse administrators. These administrators typically
create, delete, and update tables.
Data analysts. Analysts typically read data and run queries.
Data lake administrators are responsible for creating connections and sharing
them with data warehouse administrators. In turn, data warehouse
administrators create tables, set appropriate access controls, and share the
tables with data analysts.
Caution: Data analysts should not have the
following:
The ability to read objects directly from Cloud Storage (see the
Storage
Object Viewer IAM role ), which lets data analysts circumvent
access controls placed by data warehouse administrators.
The ability to bind tables to connections (like the BigQuery Connection
Administrator).
Otherwise, data analysts can create new tables that do
not have any access controls, thus circumventing controls placed by data
warehouse administrators.
Metadata caching for performance
You can use cached metadata to improve query performance on some types of
BigLake tables. Metadata caching is especially helpful in cases
where you are working with large numbers of files or if the data is hive
partitioned. The following types of BigLake tables
support metadata caching:
Amazon S3 BigLake tables
Cloud Storage BigLake tables
BigQuery uses CMETA as a distributed metadata system to handle
large tables efficiently. CMETA provides fine-grained metadata at the column and
block level, accessible through system tables. This system helps improve query
performance by optimizing data access and processing. To further accelerate
query performance on large tables, BigQuery maintains a metadata
cache. CMETA refresh jobs keep this cache up-to-date.
The metadata includes file names, partitioning information, and physical
metadata from files such as row counts. You can choose whether or not to enable
metadata caching on a table. Queries with a large number of files and with
Apache Hive partition filters benefit the most from metadata caching.
If you don't enable metadata caching, queries on the table must read the
external data source to get object metadata. Reading this data increases the
query latency; listing millions of files from the external data source can take
several minutes. If you enable metadata caching, queries can avoid listing files
from the external data source and can partition and prune files more quickly.
Metadata caching also integrates with Cloud Storage object versioning. When the cache is populated or refreshed, it captures metadata based on the live version of the Cloud Storage objects at that time. As a result, metadata caching-enabled queries read data corresponding to the specific cached object version, even if newer versions become live in Cloud Storage. Accessing data from any subsequently updated object versions in Cloud Storage necessitates a metadata cache refresh.
There are two properties that control this feature:
Maximum staleness specifies when queries use cached metadata.
Metadata cache mode specifies how the metadata is collected.
When you have metadata caching enabled, you specify the maximum interval of
metadata staleness that is acceptable for operations against the table. For
example, if you specify an interval of 1 hour, then operations against the table
use cached metadata if it has been refreshed within the past hour. If the cached
metadata is older than that, the operation falls back to retrieving metadata
from
the datastore (Amazon S3 or Cloud Storage) instead.
You can specify a staleness interval between 30 minutes and 7 days.
When you enable metadata caching for BigLake or object tables, BigQuery triggers metadata generation refresh jobs. You can choose to refresh the cache either automatically or manually:
For automatic refreshes, the cache is refreshed at a system defined
interval, usually somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes. Refreshing the
cache automatically is a good approach if the files in
the datastore
are added, deleted, or modified at random
intervals. If you need to control the timing of the refresh, for example to
trigger the refresh at the end of an extract-transform-load job, use
manual refresh.
For manual refreshes, you run the
BQ.REFRESH_EXTERNAL_METADATA_CACHE system
procedure
to refresh the metadata cache on a schedule that meets your requirements.
For BigLake tables, you can refresh the metadata selectively
by providing subdirectories of the table data directory. This lets you
avoid unnecessary metadata
processing.
Refreshing the cache manually is a good approach if the files in
the datastore
are added, deleted, or modified at known intervals,
for example as the output of a pipeline.
If you issue multiple concurrent manual refreshes, only one will succeed.
The metadata cache expires after 7 days if it isn't refreshed.
Both manual and automatic cache refreshes are executed with
INTERACTIVE query priority.
Use BACKGROUND reservations
If you choose to use automatic refreshes, we recommend that you create a
reservation , and then create an
assignment with a BACKGROUND job type
for the project that runs the metadata cache refresh jobs. With BACKGROUND reservations, refresh jobs use a dedicated resource pool which prevents the refresh jobs from competing with user queries, and prevents the jobs from potentially failing if there aren't sufficient resources available for them.
While using a shared slot pool incurs no extra cost, using BACKGROUND reservations instead provides more consistent performance by allocating a dedicated resource pool, and improves the reliability of refresh jobs and overall query efficiency in BigQuery.
You should consider how the staleness interval and metadata caching mode
values will interact before you set them. Consider the following examples:
If you are manually refreshing the metadata cache for a table, and you set
the staleness interval to 2 days, you must run the
BQ.REFRESH_EXTERNAL_METADATA_CACHE system procedure every 2 days or less
if you want operations against the table to use cached metadata.
If you are automatically refreshing the metadata cache for a table, and you
set the staleness interval to 30 minutes, it is possible that some of your
operations against the table might read from
the datastore
if the metadata cache refresh takes on the longer side of the usual
30 to 60 minute window.
To find information about metadata refresh jobs, query the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS view ,
as shown in the following example:
SELECT *
FROM `region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT`
WHERE job_id LIKE '%metadata_cache_refresh%'
AND creation_time > TIMESTAMP_SUB ( CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (), INTERVAL 6 HOUR )
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10 ;
For Cloud Storage BigLake tables that are based on Parquet
files, table statistics are
collected during the metadata cache refresh and used to improve query plans.
To learn more, see Metadata caching .
For more information on setting metadata caching options, see
Create Amazon S3 BigLake tables
or
Create Cloud Storage BigLake tables .
Cache-enabled tables with materialized views
You can use materialized views over BigLake metadata cache-enabled
tables to improve
performance and efficiency when querying structured data stored in
Cloud Storage or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
These materialized views function like materialized views over
BigQuery-managed storage tables, including the benefits of
automatic refresh
and smart tuning .
Integrations
BigLake tables are accessible from a number of other BigQuery features
and gcloud CLI services, including the following, highlighted services.
BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub)
BigLake tables are compatible with Sharing.
Datasets containing BigLake tables can be published as
Sharing listings .
Sharing subscribers can subscribe to these
listings, which provision a read-only dataset, called a linked
dataset , in
their project.
Subscribers can query all tables in the linked dataset, including all
BigLake tables. For more information, see View and subscribe to
listings .
BigQuery ML
You can use BigQuery ML to train and
run models on BigLake in Cloud Storage.
Sensitive Data Protection
Sensitive Data Protection scans your BigLake tables
to identify and classify sensitive data. If sensitive data is detected,
Sensitive Data Protection de-identification transformations can
mask, delete, or otherwise obscure
that data.
Costs
Costs are associated with the following aspects of BigLake tables:
Querying the tables.
Refreshing the metadata cache .
If you have slot
reservations , you are not
charged for querying external tables. Instead, slots are consumed for these
queries.
The following table shows how your pricing model affects how these costs are
applied:
On-demand pricing
Standard, Enterprise, and Enterprise Plus editions
Queries
You are billed for the bytes
processed by user queries.
Slots in
reservation assignments
with a QUERY job type are consumed during query time.
Manually refreshing the metadata cache .
You are billed for the bytes
processed to refresh the cache.
Slots in
reservation assignments
with a QUERY job type are consumed during cache refresh.
Automatically refreshing the metadata cache.
You are billed for the bytes
processed to refresh the cache.
Slots in
reservation assignments
with a BACKGROUND job type are consumed during cache refresh.
If there are no BACKGROUND reservations available for refreshing
the metadata cache, BigQuery automatically uses slots in
QUERY reservations instead if you are using the Enterprise or Enterprise Plus edition.
You are also charged for storage and data access by
Cloud Storage ,
Amazon S3 ,
and Azure Blob Storage ,
subject to each product's pricing guidelines.
When BigQuery interacts with Cloud Storage, you might
incur the following Cloud Storage costs:
Data storage costs for the amount of data stored.
Data retrieval costs for accessing data in
Nearline ,
Coldline ,
and Archive storage
classes. Take caution when querying tables or refreshing the metadata cache
against these storage classes, as charges can be significant.
Network usage costs for data that you read across different regions, such
as when your BigQuery dataset and Cloud Storage
bucket are in different regions.
Data processing charges. However, you aren't charged for API calls that are
made by BigQuery on your behalf, such as listing or getting
resources.
