Batch loading data
You can load data into BigQuery from Cloud Storage or from a local
file as a batch operation. The source data can be in any of the following
formats:
Avro
Comma-separated values (CSV)
JSON (newline-delimited)
ORC
Parquet
Datastore exports stored in Cloud Storage
Firestore exports stored in Cloud Storage
You can also use BigQuery Data Transfer Service to set
up recurring loads from Cloud Storage into BigQuery.
Try it for yourself
If you're new to Google Cloud, create an account to evaluate how
BigQuery performs in real-world
scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and
deploy workloads.

Before you begin
Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that give users the necessary
permissions to perform each task in this document, and create a dataset
to store your data.
Required permissions
To load data into BigQuery, you need IAM permissions to run a load job and load data into BigQuery tables and partitions. If you are loading data from Cloud Storage, you also need IAM permissions to access the bucket that contains your data.
Permissions to load data into BigQuery
To load data into a new BigQuery table or partition or to append or overwrite an existing table or partition, you need the following IAM permissions:
bigquery.tables.create
bigquery.tables.updateData
bigquery.tables.update
bigquery.jobs.create
Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need in order to load data into a BigQuery table or partition:
roles/bigquery.dataEditor
roles/bigquery.dataOwner
roles/bigquery.admin (includes the bigquery.jobs.create permission)
bigquery.user (includes the bigquery.jobs.create permission)
bigquery.jobUser (includes the bigquery.jobs.create permission)
Additionally, if you have the bigquery.datasets.create permission, you can create and
update tables using a load job in the datasets that you create.
For more information on IAM roles and permissions in
BigQuery, see Predefined roles and permissions .
Permissions to load data from Cloud Storage
To get the permissions that
you need to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin )
IAM role on the bucket.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket:
storage.buckets.get
storage.objects.get
storage.objects.list (required if you are using a URI wildcard )
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Create a dataset
Create a BigQuery dataset to store
your data.
Loading data from Cloud Storage
BigQuery supports loading data from any of the following
Cloud Storage storage classes :
Standard
Nearline
Coldline
Archive
To learn how to load data into BigQuery, see the page for your
data format:
CSV
JSON
Avro
Parquet
ORC
Datastore exports
Firestore exports
To learn how to configure a recurring load from Cloud Storage into
BigQuery, see
Cloud Storage transfers .
Location considerations
You cannot change the location of a dataset after it is created, but you can
make a copy of the dataset or manually move it. For more information, see:
Copying datasets
Moving a dataset
Retrieving the Cloud Storage URI
To load data from a Cloud Storage data source, you must provide the
Cloud Storage URI.
The Cloud Storage resource path contains your bucket name and your
object (filename). For example, if the Cloud Storage bucket is named
mybucket and the data file is named myfile.csv , the resource path would be
gs://mybucket/myfile.csv .
BigQuery does not support Cloud Storage resource paths
that include multiple consecutive slashes after the initial double slash.
Cloud Storage object names can contain multiple consecutive slash ("/")
characters. However, BigQuery converts multiple consecutive
slashes into a single slash. For example, the following resource path, though
valid in Cloud Storage, does not work in BigQuery:
gs:// bucket /my//object//name .
To retrieve the Cloud Storage resource path:
Open the Cloud Storage console.
Cloud Storage console
Browse to the location of the object (file) that contains the source data.
Click on the name of the object.
The Object details page opens.
Copy the value provided in the gsutil URI field, which begins with
gs:// .
Note: You can also use the
gcloud storage ls command to list buckets
or objects.
For Google Datastore exports, only one URI can be specified, and it
must end with .backup_info or .export_metadata .
Wildcard support for Cloud Storage URIs
If your data is separated into multiple files, you can use an asterisk (*)
wildcard to select multiple files. Use of the asterisk wildcard must follow
these rules:
The asterisk can appear inside the object name or at the end of the object
name.
Using multiple asterisks is unsupported. For example, the path
gs://mybucket/fed-*/temp/*.csv is invalid.
Using an asterisk with the bucket name is unsupported.
Examples:
The following example shows how to select all of the files in all the
folders which start with the prefix gs://mybucket/fed-samples/fed-sample :
gs://mybucket/fed-samples/fed-sample*
The following example shows how to select only files with a .csv extension
in the folder named fed-samples and any subfolders of fed-samples :
gs://mybucket/fed-samples/*.csv
The following example shows how to select files with a naming pattern of
fed-sample*.csv in the folder named fed-samples . This example doesn't
select files in subfolders of fed-samples .
gs://mybucket/fed-samples/fed-sample*.csv
When using the bq command-line tool, you might need to escape the asterisk on some
platforms.
You can't use an asterisk wildcard when you load Datastore or
Firestore export data from Cloud Storage.
Limitations
You are subject to the following limitations when you load data into
BigQuery from a Cloud Storage bucket:
BigQuery does not guarantee data consistency for external data
sources. Changes to the underlying data while a query is running can result in
unexpected behavior.
BigQuery doesn't support
Cloud Storage object versioning . If you
include a generation number in the Cloud Storage URI, then the load job
fails.
Depending on the format of your Cloud Storage source data, there may be
additional limitations. For more information, see:
CSV limitations
JSON limitations
Datastore export limitations
Firestore export limitations
Limitations on nested and repeated data
Loading data from local files
You can load data from a readable data source (such as your local machine) by
using one of the following:
The Google Cloud console
The bq command-line tool's bq load command
The API
The client libraries
When you load data using the Google Cloud console or the bq command-line tool, a load
job is automatically created.
To load data from a local data source:
Console
Open the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the BigQuery page
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
If you don't see the left pane, click last_page Expand left pane to open the pane.
In the Explorer pane, expand your project, click Datasets , and
then select a dataset.
In the details pane, click add_box Create table .
On the Create table page, in the Source section:
For Create table from , select Upload .
For Select file , click Browse .
Browse to the file, and click Open . Note that wildcards
and comma-separated lists are not supported for local files.
For File format , select CSV , JSON (newline delimited) ,
Avro , Parquet , or ORC .
On the Create table page, in the Destination section:
For Project , choose the appropriate project.
For Dataset , choose the appropriate dataset.
In the Table field, enter the name of the table you're
creating in BigQuery.
Verify that Table type is set to Native table .
In the Schema section, enter the schema
definition.
For CSV and JSON files, you can check the Auto-detect option to
enable schema auto-detect . Schema
information is self-described in the source data for other supported
file types.
You can also enter schema information manually by:
Clicking Edit as text and entering the table schema as a JSON
array:
Note: You can view the schema of an existing table in JSON
format by entering the following command:
bq show --format=prettyjson dataset.table .
Using Add Field to manually input the schema.
Select applicable items in the Advanced options section. For information on the available options, see
CSV options
and JSON options .
Optional: In the Advanced options choose the write disposition:
Write if empty : Write the data only if the table is empty.
Append to table : Append the data to the end of the table. This
setting is the default.
Overwrite table : Erase all existing data in the table before
writing the new data.
Click Create Table .
bq
Use the bq load command, specify the source_format , and include the path
to the local file.
(Optional) Supply the --location flag and set the value to your
location .
If you are loading data in a project other than your default project, add
the project ID to the dataset in the following format:
PROJECT_ID:DATASET .
bq --location = LOCATION load \
--source_format = FORMAT \
PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE \
PATH_TO_SOURCE \
SCHEMA
Replace the following:
LOCATION : your location. The --location flag is
optional. For example, if you are using BigQuery in the
Tokyo region, set the flag's value to asia-northeast1 . You can set a
default value for the location by using the
.bigqueryrc file .
FORMAT : CSV , AVRO , PARQUET , ORC , or
NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON .
project_id : your project ID.
dataset : an existing dataset.
table : the name of the table into which you're
loading data.
path_to_source : the path to the local file.
schema : a valid schema. The schema can be a local
JSON file, or it can be typed inline as part of the command. You can also
use the --autodetect flag instead of supplying a schema definition.
In addition, you can add flags for options that let you control how
BigQuery parses your data. For example, you can use the
--skip_leading_rows flag to ignore header rows in a CSV file. For more
information, see CSV options
and JSON options .
Examples:
The following command loads a local newline-delimited JSON file
( mydata.json ) into a table named mytable in mydataset in your default
project. The schema is defined in a local schema file named myschema.json .
bq load \
-- source_format = NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON \
mydataset . mytable \
./ mydata . json \
./ myschema . json
The following command loads a local CSV file ( mydata.csv ) into a table
named mytable in mydataset in myotherproject . The schema is defined
inline in the format
FIELD:DATA_TYPE , FIELD:DATA_TYPE .
bq load \
-- source_format = CSV \
myotherproject : mydataset . mytable \
./ mydata . csv \
qtr : STRING , sales : FLOAT , year : STRING
Note: When you specify the schema on the command
line, you cannot include a RECORD ( STRUCT ) type,
you cannot include a field description, and you cannot specify the
field mode. All field modes default to NULLABLE . To include field
descriptions, modes, and RECORD types, supply a
JSON schema file instead.
The following command loads a local CSV file ( mydata.csv ) into a table
named mytable in mydataset in your default project. The schema is
defined using schema auto-detection .
bq load \
-- autodetect \
-- source_format = CSV \
mydataset . mytable \
./ mydata . csv

table = dataset . table table_id
puts "Loaded #{ table . rows_count } rows into #{ table . id } "
end
Limitations
Loading data from a local data source is subject to the following limitations:
Wildcards and comma-separated lists are not supported when you load files from
a local data source. Files must be loaded individually.
When using the Google Cloud console, files loaded from a local data source
cannot exceed 100 MB. For larger files, load the file from Cloud Storage.
Load job capacity
Similar to the on-demand mode for queries, by default, load jobs use a shared
pool of slots. If a load job uses the shared pool, the reservation
default-pipeline is displayed in the job details. BigQuery
doesn't guarantee the available capacity of this shared pool or load job
throughput.
To increase throughput or predictably control the capacity of your load jobs,
you can create a slot reservation
and assign dedicated PIPELINE slots to run load jobs. For more information, see
Reservation assignments .
Loading compressed and uncompressed data
For Avro, Parquet, and ORC formats, BigQuery supports
loading files where the file data has been compressed using a
supported codec. However, BigQuery doesn't support loading files
in these formats that have themselves been compressed, for example by using
the gzip utility.
The Avro binary format is the preferred format for loading both compressed and
uncompressed data. Avro data is faster to load because the data can be read in
parallel, even when the data blocks are compressed.
For a list of supported compression codecs, see
Avro compression .
Parquet binary format is also a good choice because Parquet's efficient,
per-column encoding typically results in a better compression ratio and smaller
files. Parquet files also leverage compression techniques that allow files to be
loaded in parallel. For a list of supported compression codecs, see
Parquet compression .
The ORC binary format offers benefits similar to the benefits of the Parquet
format. Data in ORC files is fast to load because data stripes can be read in
parallel. The rows in each data stripe are loaded sequentially. To optimize load
time, use a data stripe size of approximately 256 MB or less.
For a list of supported compression codecs, see
ORC compression .
For other data formats such as CSV and JSON, BigQuery can load
uncompressed files significantly faster than compressed files because
uncompressed files can be read in parallel. Because uncompressed files are
larger, using them can lead to bandwidth limitations and higher Cloud Storage
costs for data staged in Cloud Storage prior to being loaded into
BigQuery. Keep in mind that line ordering isn't
guaranteed for compressed or uncompressed files. It's important to weigh these
tradeoffs depending on your use case.
In general, if bandwidth is limited, compress your CSV and JSON files by using
gzip before uploading them to Cloud Storage. gzip is the only
supported file compression type for CSV and JSON files when loading data into
BigQuery. If loading speed is important to your app and you have
a lot of bandwidth to load your data, leave your files uncompressed.
Appending to or overwriting a table
You can load additional data into a table either from source files or by
appending query results. If the
schema of the data does not match the schema of the destination table or
partition, you can update the schema when you append to it or overwrite it.
If you update the schema when appending data, BigQuery allows
you to:
Add new fields
Relax REQUIRED fields to NULLABLE
If you are overwriting a table, the schema is always overwritten. Schema updates
are not restricted when you overwrite a table.
In the Google Cloud console, use the Write preference option to specify
what action to take when you load data from a source file or from a query
result. The bq command-line tool and the API include the following options:
Console option
bq tool flag
BigQuery API property
Description
Write if empty
None
WRITE_EMPTY
Writes the data only if the table is empty.
Append to table
--noreplace or --replace=false ; if
--replace is unspecified, the default is append
WRITE_APPEND
(Default) Appends the data to the end of the table.
Overwrite table
--replace or --replace=true
WRITE_TRUNCATE
Erases all existing data in a table before writing the new data.
Quota policy
For information about the quota policy for batch loading data, see
Load jobs on the Quotas and limits page.
View current quota usage
You can view your current usage of query, load, extract, or copy jobs by running
an INFORMATION_SCHEMA query to view metadata about the jobs ran over a
specified time period. You can compare your current usage against the quota
limit to determine your quota usage for a
particular type of job. The following example query uses the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS view to list the number of query, load, extract, and
copy jobs by project:
SELECT
sum ( case when job_type = "QUERY" then 1 else 0 end ) as QRY_CNT ,
sum ( case when job_type = "LOAD" then 1 else 0 end ) as LOAD_CNT ,
sum ( case when job_type = "EXTRACT" then 1 else 0 end ) as EXT_CNT ,
sum ( case when job_type = "COPY" then 1 else 0 end ) as CPY_CNT
FROM `region- REGION_NAME ` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE date ( creation_time ) = CURRENT_DATE ()
Pricing
There is no charge for batch loading data into
BigQuery using the shared slot pool. For more information, see
BigQuery data ingestion pricing .
If you attempt to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket that's in a
different location than the destination BigQuery dataset,
data transfer charges
apply.
Example use case
Suppose there is a nightly batch processing pipeline that needs to be
completed by a fixed deadline. Data needs to be available by this deadline for
further processing by another batch process to generate reports to be sent to a
regulator. This use case is common in regulated industries such as finance.
Batch loading of data with load jobs
is the right approach for this use case because latency is not a concern
provided the deadline can be met. Ensure your Cloud Storage buckets
meet the location requirements
for loading data into the BigQuery dataset.
The result of a BigQuery load job is atomic; either all records
get inserted or none do. As a best practice, when inserting all data in a single
load job, create a new table by using the WRITE_TRUNCATE disposition of
the JobConfigurationLoad
resource.
This is important when retrying a failed load job, as the client might
not be able to distinguish between jobs that have failed and the failure
caused by for example in communicating the success state back to the client.
Assuming data to be ingested has been successfully copied to
Cloud Storage already, retrying with exponential backoff is sufficient
to address ingestion failures.
It's recommended that a nightly batch job doesn't hit the
default quota
of 1,500 loads per table per day even with retries. When loading data
incrementally, the default quota is sufficient for running a load job every 5
