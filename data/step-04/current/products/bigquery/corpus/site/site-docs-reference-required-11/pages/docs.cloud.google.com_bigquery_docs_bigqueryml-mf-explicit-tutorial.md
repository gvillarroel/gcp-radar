Create recommendations based on explicit feedback with a matrix factorization model
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial teaches you how to create a
matrix factorization model
and train it on the customer movie ratings in the
movielens1m dataset. You then
use the matrix factorization model to generate movie recommendations for users.
Using customer-provided ratings to train the model is called
training with explicit feedback . Matrix factorization models are trained
using the
Alternating Least Squares algorithm when you use
explicit feedback as training data.
Important: You must have a reservation in order to use a matrix factorization
model. For more information, see
Pricing .

Create the model
Create a matrix factorization model and train it on the data in the ratings
table. The model is trained to predict a rating for every user-item pair,
based on the customer-provided movie ratings.
SQL
The following CREATE MODEL statement uses these columns to generate
recommendations:
user_id —The user ID.
item_id —The movie ID.
rating —The explicit rating from 1 to 5 that the user gave the
item.
Follow these steps to create the model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.mf_explicit`
OPTIONS (
MODEL_TYPE = 'matrix_factorization' ,
FEEDBACK_TYPE = 'explicit' ,
USER_COL = 'user_id' ,
ITEM_COL = 'item_id' ,
L2_REG = 9.83 ,
NUM_FACTORS = 34 )
AS
SELECT
user_id ,
item_id ,
rating
FROM `bqml_tutorial.ratings` ;
The query takes about 10 minutes to complete, after which the
mf_explicit model appears in the Explorer pane. Because
the query uses a CREATE MODEL statement to create a model, you don't see
query results.
BigQuery DataFrames
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart
using BigQuery DataFrames .
For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation .
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see Set
up ADC for a local development environment .
from bigframes.ml import decomposition
import bigframes.pandas as bpd
# Load data from BigQuery
bq_df = bpd . read_gbq (
"bqml_tutorial.ratings" , columns = ( "user_id" , "item_id" , "rating" )
)
# Create the Matrix Factorization model
model = decomposition . MatrixFactorization (
num_factors = 34 ,
feedback_type = "explicit" ,
user_col = "user_id" ,
item_col = "item_id" ,
rating_col = "rating" ,
l2_reg = 9.83 ,
)
model . fit ( bq_df )
model . to_gbq (
your_model_id , replace = True # For example: "bqml_tutorial.mf_explicit"
)
The code takes about 10 minutes to complete, after which the
mf_explicit model appears in the Explorer pane.
Get training statistics
Optionally, you can view the model's training statistics in the
Google Cloud console.
A machine learning algorithm builds a model by creating many iterations of
the model using different parameters, and then selecting the version of the
model that minimizes loss .
This process is called empirical risk minimization. The model's training
statistics let you see the loss associated with each iteration of the model.
Follow these steps to view the model's training statistics:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
If you don't see the left pane, click last_page Expand left pane to open the pane.
In the Explorer pane, expand your project, click Datasets , and then
click the bqml_tutorial dataset.
Click the Models tab.
Click the mf_explicit model and then click the Training tab
In the View as section, click Table . The results should look
similar to the following:
+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+
| Iteration | Training Data Loss | Duration (seconds) |
+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 11 | 0.3943 | 42.59 |
+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 10 | 0.3979 | 27.37 |
+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 9 | 0.4038 | 40.79 |
+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+
| ... | ... | ... |
+-----------+--------------------+--------------------+
The Training Data Loss column represents the loss metric calculated
after the model is trained. Because this is a matrix factorization model,
this column shows the
mean squared error .
You can also use the
ML.TRAINING_INFO function
to see model training statistics.
Evaluate the model
Evaluate the performance of the model by comparing the predicted movie ratings
returned by the model against the actual user movie ratings from the training
data.
SQL
Use the ML.EVALUATE function to evaluate the model:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
SELECT
*
FROM
ML . EVALUATE (
MODEL `bqml_tutorial.mf_explicit` ,
(
SELECT
user_id ,
item_id ,
rating
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.ratings`
));
The results should look similar to the following:
+---------------------+---------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| mean_absolute_error | mean_squared_error | mean_squared_log_error | median_absolute_error | r2_score | explained_variance |
+---------------------+---------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 0.48494444327829156 | 0.39433706592870565 | 0.025437895793637522 | 0.39017059802629905 | 0.6840033369412044 | 0.6840033369412264 |
+---------------------+---------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
An important metric in the evaluation results is the
R 2
score .
The R 2 score is a statistical measure that determines if the
linear regression predictions approximate the actual data. A value of 0
indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the
response data around the mean. A value of 1 indicates that the model
explains all the variability of the response data around the mean.
For more information about the ML.EVALUATE function output, see
Output .
You can also call ML.EVALUATE without providing the input data. It will
use the evaluation metrics calculated during training.
BigQuery DataFrames
Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames
setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart
using BigQuery DataFrames .
For more information, see the
BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation .
To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see Set
up ADC for a local development environment .
Call
model.score()
to evaluate the model.
# Evaluate the model using the score() function
model . score ( bq_df )
# Output:
# mean_absolute_error mean_squared_error mean_squared_log_error median_absolute_error r2_score explained_variance
# 0.485403 0.395052 0.025515 0.390573 0.68343 0.68343
Get the predicted ratings for a subset of user-item pairs
Get the predicted rating for each movie for five users.
SQL
Use the ML.RECOMMEND function to get predicted ratings:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, paste in the following query and click Run :
SELECT
*
FROM
ML . RECOMMEND (
MODEL `bqml_tutorial.mf_explicit` ,
(
SELECT
user_id
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.ratings`
LIMIT 5
));
The results should look similar to the following:
+--------------------+---------+---------+
| predicted_rating | user_id | item_id |
+--------------------+---------+---------+
| 4.2125303962491873 | 4 | 3169 |
