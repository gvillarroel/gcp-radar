INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BI_CAPACITIES view
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BI_CAPACITIES view contains metadata about the current
state of BI Engine capacity. If you want to view the history
of changes to BI Engine reservation, see the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BI_CAPACITY_CHANGES view .
Required permission
To query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BI_CAPACITIES view, you need the
bigquery.bireservations.get Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission for
BI Engine reservations.
For more information about BigQuery permissions, see
Access control with IAM .
Schema
When you query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BI_CAPACITIES view, the query results
contain one row with current state of BI Engine capacity.
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BI_CAPACITIES view has the following schema:
Column name
Data type
Value
project_id
STRING
The project ID of the project that contains BI Engine
capacity.
project_number
INTEGER
The project number of the project that contains
BI Engine capacity.
bi_capacity_name
STRING
The name of the object. There can only be one capacity per
project, hence the name is always set to default .
size
INTEGER
BI Engine RAM in bytes
preferred_tables
REPEATED STRING
Set of preferred tables this BI Engine capacity must be
used for. If set to null , BI Engine capacity
is used for all queries in the current project
For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of
using a wildcard ( SELECT * ). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from
breaking if the underlying schema changes.
Scope and syntax
Queries against this view must include a
region qualifier . A project ID
is optional. If no project ID is specified, the project that the query runs
in is used.
View name
Resource scope
Region scope
[ PROJECT_ID .]`region- REGION `.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BI_CAPACITIES
Project level
REGION
Replace the following:
Optional: PROJECT_ID : the ID of your
Google Cloud project. If not specified, the default project is used.
REGION : any dataset region name .
For example, `region-us` .
Note: You must use a region qualifier
to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. The location of the query
execution must match the region of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA view.
Example
-- Returns current state of BI Engine capacity.
SELECT * FROM myproject . `region-us` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . BI_CAPACITIES ;
Examples
The following example retrieves current BI Engine capacity changes from
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BI_CAPACITIES view.
To run the query against a project other than the project that the query is
running in, add the project ID to the region in the following format:
` project_id `.` region_id `.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.BI_CAPACITIES .
The following example shows the current state of BI Engine in the
project with id 'my-project-id':
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-id.region-us` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . BI_CAPACITIES
The result looks similar to the following:
+---------------+----------------+------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| project_id | project_number | bi_capacity_name | size | preferred_tables |
+---------------+----------------+------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| my-project-id | 123456789000 | default | 268435456000 | "my-company-project-id.dataset1.table1","bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips"] |
+---------------+----------------+------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The following example returns size of BI Engine capacity in
gigabytes for the query project:
SELECT
project_id ,
size / 1024.0 / 1024.0 / 1024.0 AS size_gb
FROM `region-us` . INFORMATION_SCHEMA . BI_CAPACITIES
The result looks similar to the following:
+---------------+---------+
| project_id | size_gb |
+---------------+---------+
| my-project-id | 250.0 |
+---------------+---------+
