Approximate aggregate functions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
GoogleSQL for BigQuery supports approximate aggregate functions.
To learn about the syntax for aggregate function calls, see
Aggregate function calls .
Approximate aggregate functions are scalable in terms of memory usage and time,
but produce approximate results instead of exact results. These functions
typically require less memory than exact aggregation functions
like COUNT(DISTINCT ...) , but also introduce statistical uncertainty.
This makes approximate aggregation appropriate for large data streams for
which linear memory usage is impractical, as well as for data that is
already approximate.
The approximate aggregate functions in this section work directly on the
input data, rather than an intermediate estimation of the data. These functions
don't allow users to specify the precision for the estimation with
sketches. If you would like to specify precision with sketches, see:
HyperLogLog++ functions to estimate cardinality.
KLL functions to estimate quantile values.
Function list
Name
Summary
APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT
Gets the approximate result for COUNT(DISTINCT expression) .
APPROX_QUANTILES
Gets the approximate quantile boundaries.
APPROX_TOP_COUNT
Gets the approximate top elements and their approximate count.
APPROX_TOP_SUM
Gets the approximate top elements and sum, based on the approximate sum
of an assigned weight.
APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT
APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT (
expression
)
Description
Returns the approximate result for COUNT(DISTINCT expression) . The value
returned is a statistical estimate, not necessarily the actual value.
This function is less accurate than COUNT(DISTINCT expression) , but performs
better on huge input.
Supported Argument Types
Any data type except :
ARRAY
STRUCT
INTERVAL
Returned Data Types
INT64
Examples
SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT ( x ) as approx_distinct
FROM UNNEST ( [ 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 ] ) as x ;
/*-----------------+
| approx_distinct |
+-----------------+
| 5 |
+-----------------*/
APPROX_QUANTILES
APPROX_QUANTILES (
[ DISTINCT ]
expression , number
[ { IGNORE | RESPECT } NULLS ]
)
Description
Returns the approximate boundaries for a group of expression values, where
number represents the number of quantiles to create. This function returns an
array of number + 1 elements, sorted in ascending order, where the
first element is the approximate minimum and the last element is the approximate
maximum.
Returns NULL if there are zero input rows or expression evaluates to
NULL for all rows.
To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass
into this function, see
Aggregate function calls .
Supported Argument Types
expression : Any supported data type except :
ARRAY
STRUCT
INTERVAL
number : INT64 literal or query parameter.
Returned Data Types
ARRAY<T> where T is the type specified by expression .
Examples
SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES ( x , 2 ) AS approx_quantiles
FROM UNNEST ( [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] ) AS x ;
/*------------------+
| approx_quantiles |
+------------------+
| [1, 5, 10] |
+------------------*/
SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES ( x , 100 ) [ OFFSET ( 90 ) ] AS percentile_90
FROM UNNEST ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] ) AS x ;
/*---------------+
| percentile_90 |
+---------------+
| 9 |
+---------------*/
SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES ( DISTINCT x , 2 ) AS approx_quantiles
FROM UNNEST ( [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] ) AS x ;
/*------------------+
| approx_quantiles |
+------------------+
| [1, 6, 10] |
+------------------*/
SELECT FORMAT ( "%T" , APPROX_QUANTILES ( x , 2 RESPECT NULLS )) AS approx_quantiles
FROM UNNEST ( [ NULL , NULL , 1 , 1 , 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] ) AS x ;
/*------------------+
| approx_quantiles |
+------------------+
| [NULL, 4, 10] |
+------------------*/
SELECT FORMAT ( "%T" , APPROX_QUANTILES ( DISTINCT x , 2 RESPECT NULLS )) AS approx_quantiles
FROM UNNEST ( [ NULL , NULL , 1 , 1 , 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] ) AS x ;
/*------------------+
| approx_quantiles |
+------------------+
| [NULL, 6, 10] |
+------------------*/
APPROX_TOP_COUNT
APPROX_TOP_COUNT (
expression , number
)
Description
Returns the approximate top elements of expression as an array of STRUCT s.
The number parameter specifies the number of elements returned.
Each STRUCT contains two fields. The first field (named value ) contains an
input value. The second field (named count ) contains an INT64 specifying the
number of times the value was returned.
Returns NULL if there are zero input rows.
To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass
into this function, see
Aggregate function calls .
Supported Argument Types
expression : Any data type that the GROUP BY clause supports.
number : INT64 literal or query parameter.
Returned Data Types
ARRAY<STRUCT>
Examples
SELECT APPROX_TOP_COUNT ( x , 2 ) as approx_top_count
FROM UNNEST ( [ "apple" , "apple" , "pear" , "pear" , "pear" , "banana" ] ) as x ;
/*-------------------------+
| approx_top_count |
+-------------------------+
| [{pear, 3}, {apple, 2}] |
+-------------------------*/
NULL handling
APPROX_TOP_COUNT doesn't ignore NULL s in the input. For example:
SELECT APPROX_TOP_COUNT ( x , 2 ) as approx_top_count
FROM UNNEST ( [ NULL , "pear" , "pear" , "pear" , "apple" , NULL ] ) as x ;
/*------------------------+
| approx_top_count |
+------------------------+
| [{pear, 3}, {NULL, 2}] |
+------------------------*/
APPROX_TOP_SUM
APPROX_TOP_SUM (
expression , weight , number
)
Description
Returns the approximate top elements of expression , ordered by the sum of the
weight values provided for each unique value of expression . The number
parameter specifies the number of elements returned.
If the weight input is negative or NaN , this function returns an error.
The elements are returned as an array of STRUCT s.
Each STRUCT contains two fields: value and sum .
The value field contains the value of the input expression. The sum field is
the same type as weight , and is the approximate sum of the input weight
associated with the value field.
Returns NULL if there are zero input rows.
To learn more about the optional aggregate clauses that you can pass
into this function, see
Aggregate function calls .
Supported Argument Types
expression : Any data type that the GROUP BY clause supports.
weight : One of the following:
INT64
NUMERIC
BIGNUMERIC
FLOAT64
number : INT64 literal or query parameter.
Returned Data Types
ARRAY<STRUCT>
Examples
SELECT APPROX_TOP_SUM ( x , weight , 2 ) AS approx_top_sum FROM
UNNEST ( [
STRUCT ( "apple" AS x , 3 AS weight ),
( "pear" , 2 ),
( "apple" , 0 ),
( "banana" , 5 ),
( "pear" , 4 )
] );
/*--------------------------+
| approx_top_sum |
+--------------------------+
| [{pear, 6}, {banana, 5}] |
+--------------------------*/
NULL handling
APPROX_TOP_SUM doesn't ignore NULL values for the expression and weight
parameters.
SELECT APPROX_TOP_SUM ( x , weight , 2 ) AS approx_top_sum FROM
UNNEST ( [ STRUCT ( "apple" AS x , NULL AS weight ), ( "pear" , 0 ), ( "pear" , NULL ) ] );
/*----------------------------+
| approx_top_sum |
+----------------------------+
| [{pear, 0}, {apple, NULL}] |
+----------------------------*/

UNNEST ( [ STRUCT ( "apple" AS x , 0 AS weight ), ( NULL , 2 ) ] );
/*-------------------------+
| approx_top_sum |
+-------------------------+
| [{NULL, 2}, {apple, 0}] |
