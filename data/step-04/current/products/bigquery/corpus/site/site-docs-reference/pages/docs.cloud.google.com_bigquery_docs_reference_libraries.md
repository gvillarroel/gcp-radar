BigQuery API Client Libraries
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows how to get started with the Cloud Client Libraries for the
BigQuery API. Client libraries make it easier to access
Google Cloud APIs from a supported language. Although you can use
Google Cloud APIs directly by making raw requests to the server, client
libraries provide simplifications that significantly reduce the amount of code
you need to write.
Read more about the Cloud Client Libraries
and the older Google API Client Libraries in
Client libraries explained .
Install the client library
C#
Install-Package Google.Cloud.BigQuery.V2 -Pre
For more information, see Setting Up a C# Development Environment .
Go
go get cloud.google.com/go/bigquery
For more information, see Setting Up a Go Development Environment .
Java
If you are using Maven , add
the following to your pom.xml file. For more information about
BOMs, see The Google Cloud Platform Libraries BOM .
< !-- Using libraries - bom to manage versions .
See https : //github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-opensource-java/wiki/The-Google-Cloud-Platform-Libraries-BOM -- >

If you are using Gradle ,
add the following to your dependencies:
implementation platform ( ' com . google . cloud : libraries - bom : 26.45.0 ' )
implementation ' com . google . cloud : google - cloud - bigquery '
If you are using sbt , add
the following to your dependencies:
libraryDependencies += "com.google.cloud" % "google-cloud-bigquery" % "2.42.2"
If you're using Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ, you can add client libraries to your
project using the following IDE plugins:
Cloud Code for VS Code
Cloud Code for IntelliJ
The plugins provide additional functionality, such as key management for service accounts. Refer
to each plugin's documentation for details.
Note: Cloud Java client libraries do not currently support Android.
For more information, see Setting Up a Java Development Environment .
Node.js
npm install @google-cloud/bigquery
For more information, see Setting Up a Node.js Development Environment .
PHP
composer require google/cloud-bigquery
For more information, see Using PHP on Google Cloud .
Python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery
For more information, see Setting Up a Python Development Environment .
Ruby
gem install google-cloud-bigquery
For more information, see Setting Up a Ruby Development Environment .
Set up authentication
To authenticate calls to Google Cloud APIs, client libraries support
Application Default Credentials (ADC) ;
the libraries look for credentials in a set of defined locations and use those credentials
to authenticate requests to the API. With ADC, you can make
credentials available to your application in a variety of environments, such as local
development or production, without needing to modify your application code.
For production environments, the way you set up ADC depends on the service
and context. For more information, see Set up Application Default Credentials .
For a local development environment, you can set up ADC with the credentials
that are associated with your Google Account:
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
A sign-in screen appears. After you sign in, your credentials are stored in the
local credential file used by ADC .
Use the client library
The following example shows how to initialize a client and perform a query on a BigQuery API public dataset.
Note: JRuby is not supported.
C#
using Google.Cloud.BigQuery.V2 ;
using System ;
public class BigQueryQuery
{
public void Query (
string projectId = "your-project-id"
)
{
BigQueryClient client = BigQueryClient . Create ( projectId );
string query = @"
SELECT name FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013`
WHERE state = 'TX'
LIMIT 100" ;
BigQueryJob job = client . CreateQueryJob (
sql : query ,
parameters : null ,
options : new QueryOptions { UseQueryCache = false });
// Wait for the job to complete.
job = job . PollUntilCompleted (). ThrowOnAnyError ();
// Display the results
foreach ( BigQueryRow row in client . GetQueryResults ( job . Reference ))
{
Console . WriteLine ( $"{row[" name "]}" );
}
}
}
Go
import (
"context"
"fmt"
"io"
"cloud.google.com/go/bigquery"
"google.golang.org/api/iterator"
)
// queryBasic demonstrates issuing a query and reading results.
func queryBasic ( w io . Writer , projectID string ) error {
// projectID := "my-project-id"
ctx := context . Background ()
client , err := bigquery . NewClient ( ctx , projectID )
if err != nil {
return fmt . Errorf ( "bigquery.NewClient: %v" , err )
}
defer client . Close ()
q := client . Query (
"SELECT name FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013` " +
"WHERE state = \"TX\" " +
"LIMIT 100" )
// Location must match that of the dataset(s) referenced in the query.
q . Location = "US"
// Run the query and print results when the query job is completed.
job , err := q . Run ( ctx )
if err != nil {
return err
}
status , err := job . Wait ( ctx )
if err != nil {
return err
}
if err := status . Err (); err != nil {
return err
}
it , err := job . Read ( ctx )
for {
var row [] bigquery . Value
err := it . Next ( & row )
if err == iterator . Done {
break
}
if err != nil {
return err
}
fmt . Fprintln ( w , row )
}
return nil

BigQuery DataFrames (BigFrames)
BigQuery DataFrames is a pythonic DataFrame and machine learning (ML) API powered by the BigQuery engine. It implements the pandas and scikit-learn APIs by pushing the processing down to BigQuery through SQL conversion.
To get started with BigQuery DataFrames, install the library:
pip install --upgrade bigframes
The following example shows how to initialize BigQuery DataFrames and perform a simple query.
import bigframes . pandas as bpd
# Set BigQuery DataFrames options
# Note: The project option is not required in all environments.
# On BigQuery Studio, the project ID is automatically detected.
bpd . options . bigquery . project = your_gcp_project_id
# Use "partial" ordering mode to generate more efficient queries, but the
# order of the rows in DataFrames may not be deterministic if you have not
# explictly sorted it. Some operations that depend on the order, such as
# head() will not function until you explictly order the DataFrame. Set the
# ordering mode to "strict" (default) for more pandas compatibility.
bpd . options . bigquery . ordering_mode = "partial"
# Create a DataFrame from a BigQuery table
query_or_table = "bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins"
df = bpd . read_gbq ( query_or_table )
# Efficiently preview the results using the .peek() method.
df . peek ()
For more information, see the BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation and Getting started with BigQuery DataFrames .
