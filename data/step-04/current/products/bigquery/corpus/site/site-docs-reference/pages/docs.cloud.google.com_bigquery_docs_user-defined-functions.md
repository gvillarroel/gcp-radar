User-defined functions
A user-defined function (UDF) lets you create a function by using a SQL
expression or JavaScript code. A UDF accepts columns of input, performs actions
on the input, and returns the result of those actions as a value.
You can define UDFs as either persistent or temporary. You can reuse
persistent UDFs across multiple queries, while temporary UDFs only exist in the
scope of a single query.
Note: Persistent UDFs are safe to call when shared between owners. UDFs cannot
mutate data, talk to external systems, or send logs to Google Cloud Observability or similar
applications.
To create a UDF, use the
CREATE FUNCTION
statement. To delete a persistent user-defined function, use the
DROP FUNCTION
statement. Temporary UDFs expire as soon as the query finishes. The DROP
FUNCTION statement is only supported for temporary UDFs in
multi-statement queries and
procedures .
For information on UDFs in legacy SQL, see
User-defined functions in legacy SQL .
SQL UDFs
The following example creates a temporary SQL UDF named AddFourAndDivide and
calls the UDF from within a SELECT statement:
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION AddFourAndDivide ( x INT64 , y INT64 )
RETURNS FLOAT64
AS (
( x + 4 ) / y
);
SELECT
val , AddFourAndDivide ( val , 2 )
FROM
UNNEST ( [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 ] ) AS val ;
This example produces the following output:
+-----+-----+
| val | f0_ |
+-----+-----+
| 2 | 3.0 |
| 3 | 3.5 |
| 5 | 4.5 |
| 8 | 6.0 |
+-----+-----+
The next example creates the same function as a persistent UDF:
CREATE FUNCTION mydataset . AddFourAndDivide ( x INT64 , y INT64 )
RETURNS FLOAT64
AS (
( x + 4 ) / y
);
Because this UDF is persistent, you must specify a dataset for the function
( mydataset in this example). After you run the CREATE FUNCTION statement,
you can call the function from a query:
SELECT
val , mydataset . AddFourAndDivide ( val , 2 )
FROM
UNNEST ( [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 12 ] ) AS val ;
Templated SQL UDF parameters
A parameter with a type equal to ANY TYPE can match more than one argument
type when the function is called.
If more than one parameter has type ANY TYPE , then BigQuery doesn't
enforce any type relationship between these arguments.
The function return type cannot be ANY TYPE . It must be either omitted,
which means to be automatically determined based on sql_expression ,
or an explicit type.
Passing the function arguments of types that are incompatible with the
function definition results in an error at call time.
The following example shows a SQL UDF that uses a templated parameter.
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION addFourAndDivideAny ( x ANY TYPE , y ANY TYPE )
AS (
( x + 4 ) / y
);
SELECT
addFourAndDivideAny ( 3 , 4 ) AS integer_input ,
addFourAndDivideAny ( 1.59 , 3.14 ) AS floating_point_input ;
This example produces the following output:
+----------------+-----------------------+
| integer_input | floating_point_input |
+----------------+-----------------------+
| 1.75 | 1.7802547770700636 |
+----------------+-----------------------+
The next example uses a templated parameter to return the last element of an
array of any type:
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION lastArrayElement ( arr ANY TYPE )
AS (
arr [ ORDINAL ( ARRAY_LENGTH ( arr )) ]
);
SELECT
lastArrayElement ( x ) AS last_element
FROM (
SELECT [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ] AS x
);
This example produces the following output:
+--------------+
| last_element |
+--------------+
| 13 |
+--------------+
Scalar subqueries
A SQL UDF can return the value of a
scalar subquery .
A scalar subquery must select a single column.
The following example shows a SQL UDF that uses a scalar subquery to count the
number of users with a given age in a user table:
CREATE TEMP TABLE users
AS (
SELECT
1 AS id , 10 AS age
UNION ALL
SELECT
2 AS id , 30 AS age
UNION ALL
SELECT
3 AS id , 10 AS age
);
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION countUserByAge ( userAge INT64 )
AS (
( SELECT COUNT ( 1 ) FROM users WHERE age = userAge )
);
SELECT
countUserByAge ( 10 ) AS count_user_age_10 ,
countUserByAge ( 20 ) AS count_user_age_20 ,
countUserByAge ( 30 ) AS count_user_age_30 ;
This example produces the following output:
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| count_user_age_10 | count_user_age_20 | count_user_age_30 |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| 2 | 0 | 1 |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
Default project in SQL expressions
In the body of a SQL UDF, any references to BigQuery entities,
such as tables or views, must include the project ID, unless the entity resides
in the same project that contains the UDF.
For example, consider the following statement:
CREATE FUNCTION project1 . mydataset . myfunction ()
AS (
( SELECT COUNT ( * ) FROM mydataset . mytable )
);
If you run this statement from project1 and mydataset.mytable exists in
project1 , then the statement succeeds. However, if you run this statement
from a different project, then the statement fails. To correct the error,
include the project ID in the table reference:
CREATE FUNCTION project1 . mydataset . myfunction ()
AS (
( SELECT COUNT ( * ) FROM project1 . mydataset . mytable )
);
You can also reference an entity in a different project or dataset from the
one where you create the function:
CREATE FUNCTION project1 . mydataset . myfunction ()
AS (
( SELECT COUNT ( * ) FROM project2 . another_dataset . another_table )
);
Use system variables with SQL UDFs
The @@session_id and @@location
system variables are supported with
SQL UDFs. You can include these system variables anywhere in your function
creation statement to return the session ID or location of the current query.
All other system variables aren't supported.
JavaScript UDFs
A JavaScript UDF lets you call code written in JavaScript from a SQL query.
JavaScript UDFs typically consume more slot resources as compared to standard SQL
queries, decreasing job performance. If the function can be
expressed in SQL, it is often more optimal to run the code as a standard
SQL query job.
The following example shows a JavaScript UDF. The JavaScript code is quoted
within a
raw string .
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION multiplyInputs ( x FLOAT64 , y FLOAT64 )
RETURNS FLOAT64
LANGUAGE js
AS r " ""
return x*y;
"" " ;
WITH numbers AS
( SELECT 1 AS x , 5 as y
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS x , 10 as y
UNION ALL
SELECT 3 as x , 15 as y )
SELECT x , y , multiplyInputs ( x , y ) AS product
FROM numbers ;
This example produces the following output:
+-----+-----+--------------+
| x | y | product |
+-----+-----+--------------+
| 1 | 5 | 5 |
| 2 | 10 | 20 |
| 3 | 15 | 45 |
+-----+-----+--------------+
The next example sums the values of all fields named foo in the given JSON string.
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION SumFieldsNamedFoo ( json_row STRING )
RETURNS FLOAT64
LANGUAGE js
AS r " ""
function SumFoo(obj) {
var sum = 0;
for (var field in obj) {
if (obj.hasOwnProperty(field) && obj[field] != null) {
if (typeof obj[field] == " object ") {
sum += SumFoo(obj[field]);
} else if (field == " foo ") {
sum += obj[field];
}
}
}
return sum;
}
var row = JSON.parse(json_row);
return SumFoo(row);
"" " ;
WITH Input AS (
SELECT
STRUCT ( 1 AS foo , 2 AS bar , STRUCT ( 'foo' AS x , 3.14 AS foo ) AS baz ) AS s ,
10 AS foo
UNION ALL
SELECT
NULL ,
4 AS foo
UNION ALL
SELECT
STRUCT ( NULL , 2 AS bar , STRUCT ( 'fizz' AS x , 1.59 AS foo ) AS baz ) AS s ,
NULL AS foo
)
SELECT
TO_JSON_STRING ( t ) AS json_row ,
SumFieldsNamedFoo ( TO_JSON_STRING ( t )) AS foo_sum
FROM Input AS t ;
The example produces the following output:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| json_row | foo_sum |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| { "s" :{ "foo" : 1 , "bar" : 2 , "baz" :{ "x" : "foo" , "foo" : 3.14 }} , "foo" : 10 } | 14.14 |
| { "s" : null , "foo" : 4 } | 4 |
| { "s" :{ "foo" : null , "bar" : 2 , "baz" :{ "x" : "fizz" , "foo" : 1.59 }} , "foo" : null } | 1.59 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
Supported JavaScript UDF data types
Some SQL types have a direct mapping to JavaScript types, but others don't.
BigQuery represents types in the following manner:
BigQuery data type
JavaScript data type
ARRAY
ARRAY
BOOL
BOOLEAN
BYTES
base64-encoded STRING
FLOAT64
NUMBER
NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC
If a NUMERIC or BIGNUMERIC value can be represented exactly as an
IEEE 754 floating-point
value and has no fractional part, the value is encoded as a Number. These
values are in the range [-2 53 , 2 53 ]. Otherwise, the
value is encoded as a string.
STRING
STRING
STRUCT
OBJECT where each STRUCT field is a named field
TIMESTAMP
DATE with a microsecond field containing the microsecond
fraction of the timestamp
DATE
DATE
JSON
JSON OBJECTS, ARRAYS, and VALUES are converted into equivalent JavaScript
OBJECTS, ARRAYS, and VALUES.
JavaScript does not support INT64 values. Only JSON numbers in the range
[-2 53 , 2 53 ] are converted exactly. Otherwise, the numeric
value is rounded, which could result in a loss of precision.
Because JavaScript does not support a 64-bit integer type,
INT64 is unsupported as an input type for JavaScript
UDFs. Instead, use FLOAT64 to represent integer
values as a number, or STRING to represent integer
values as a string.
BigQuery does support INT64 as a return type
in JavaScript UDFs. In this case, the JavaScript function body can return either
a JavaScript Number or a String. BigQuery then converts either of
these types to INT64 .
If the return value of the JavaScript UDF is a
Promise , BigQuery waits for the Promise
until Promise is settled. If the Promise settles into a
fulfilled state, BigQuery returns its result. If the
Promise settles into a rejected state, BigQuery returns
an error.
Quote rules
You must enclose JavaScript code in quotes. For one line code snippets,
you can use a standard quoted string:
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION plusOne ( x FLOAT64 )
RETURNS FLOAT64
LANGUAGE js
AS "return x+1;" ;
SELECT val , plusOne ( val ) AS result
FROM UNNEST ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] ) AS val ;
This example produces the following output:
+-----------+-----------+
| val | result |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1 | 2.0 |
| 2 | 3.0 |
| 3 | 4.0 |
| 4 | 5.0 |
| 5 | 6.0 |
+-----------+-----------+
In cases where the snippet contains quotes, or consists of multiple lines, use
triple-quoted blocks:
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION customGreeting ( a STRING )
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE js
AS r " ""
var d = new Date();
if (d.getHours() < 12) {
return 'Good Morning, ' + a + '!';
} else {
return 'Good Evening, ' + a + '!';
}
"" " ;
SELECT customGreeting ( names ) AS everyone
FROM UNNEST ( [ 'Hannah' , 'Max' , 'Jakob' ] ) AS names ;
This example produces the following output:
+-----------------------+
| everyone |
+-----------------------+
| Good Morning, Hannah! |
| Good Morning, Max! |
| Good Morning, Jakob! |
+-----------------------+
Include JavaScript libraries
You can extend your JavaScript UDFs using the OPTIONS section.
This section lets you specify external code libraries for the UDF.
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION myFunc ( a FLOAT64 , b STRING )
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE js
OPTIONS (
library =[ 'gs://my-bucket/path/to/lib1.js' , 'gs://my-bucket/path/to/lib2.js' ] )
AS r " ""
// Assumes 'doInterestingStuff' is defined in one of the library files.
return doInterestingStuff(a, b);
"" " ;
SELECT myFunc ( 3.14 , 'foo' );
In the preceding example, code in lib1.js and lib2.js
is available to any code in the [external_code] section of the UDF.
Best practices for JavaScript UDFs
Prefilter your input
If your input can be filtered down before being passed to a JavaScript
UDF, your query might be faster and cheaper.
Avoid persistent mutable state
Don't store or access mutable state across JavaScript UDF calls. For
example, avoid the following pattern:
-- Avoid this pattern
CREATE FUNCTION temp . mutable ()
RETURNS INT64
LANGUAGE js
AS r " ""
var i = 0; // Mutable state
function dontDoThis() {
return ++i;
}
return dontDoThis()
"" " ;
Use memory efficiently
The JavaScript processing environment has limited memory available per query.
JavaScript UDF queries that accumulate too much local state might fail due to
memory exhaustion.
Authorize routines
You can authorize UDFs as routines .
Authorized routines let you share query results with specific users or groups
without giving them access to the underlying tables that generated the results.
For example, an authorized routine can compute an aggregation
over data or look up a table value and use that value in a computation.
For more information, see Authorized routines .
Add descriptions to UDFs
To add a description to a UDF, follow these steps:
Console
Go to the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to BigQuery
In the left pane, click explore Explorer :
If you don't see the left pane, click last_page Expand left pane to open the pane.
In the Explorer pane, expand your project and click Datasets .
Click your dataset. You can also use the search feature or filters to find
your dataset.
Click the Routines tab, and then select the function.
In the details pane, click
mode_edit Edit Routine
Details to edit the description text.
In the dialog, enter a description in the box or edit the existing
description. Click Save to save the new description text.
SQL
To update the description of a function, recreate your function using
the CREATE FUNCTION DDL statement
and set the description field in the OPTIONS list:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the query editor, enter the following statement:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mydataset . my_function (...)
AS (
...
) OPTIONS (
description = ' DESCRIPTION '
);
Click play_circle Run .
For more information about how to run queries, see Run an interactive query .
Create custom masking routines
Note: This feature may not be available when using reservations that are created with
certain BigQuery editions. For more information about which
features are enabled in each edition, see Introduction to
BigQuery editions .
You can create UDFs for use with
custom masking routines .
You should create dedicated datasets and set up proper IAM
permissions for managing masking UDFs.
Custom masking routines must meet the following requirements:
The custom masking routine must be a SQL UDF.
In the function OPTIONS , the data_governance_type option must be set to
DATA_MASKING .
Custom masking routines support the following functions:
AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES AEAD encryption function with KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN (raw key usage not supported)
AEAD.DECRYPT_STRING, AEAD encryption function with KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN (raw key usage not supported)
AEAD.ENCRYPT AEAD encryption function with keyset_chain (raw key usage not supported)

Custom masking routines can accept either no inputs or one input within
BigQuery data types ,
with the exception of GEOGRAPHY and STRUCT . GEOGRAPHY and STRUCT are
not supported for custom masking routines.
Templated SQL UDF parameters
are not supported.
When an input is provided, the input and output data types must be the same.
An output type must be provided.
No other UDFs, subqueries, tables, or views can be referenced in the
definition body.
After creating a masking routine, the routine cannot be changed to a
standard function. This means that if the data_governance_type option is
set to DATA_MASKING , then you cannot change data_governance_type using
DDL statements or API calls.
Custom masking routines support CASE and CASE expr statement. Following operators can be used with CASE and CASE expr statements:
Comparison Operators - < , <= , > , >= , = , != , IN
Logical Operators - AND , OR , NOT
IS Operator
For example, a masking routine that replaces a user's social security number
with XXX-XX-XXXX might look as follows:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION SSN_Mask ( ssn STRING ) RETURNS STRING
OPTIONS ( data_governance_type = "DATA_MASKING" ) AS (
SAFE . REGEXP_REPLACE ( ssn , '[0-9]' , 'X' ) # 123-45-6789 -> XXX-XX-XXXX
);
The following example hashes with user provided salt , using the
SHA256
function:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ` project .dataset.masking_routine1` (
ssn STRING )
RETURNS STRING OPTIONS ( data_governance_type = 'DATA_MASKING' )
AS (
CAST ( SHA256 ( CONCAT ( ssn , ' salt ' )) AS STRING format 'HEX' )
);
The following example masks a DATETIME column with a constant value:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ` project .dataset.masking_routine2` (
column DATETIME )
RETURNS DATETIME OPTIONS ( data_governance_type = 'DATA_MASKING' )
AS (
SAFE_CAST ( '2023-09-07' AS DATETIME )
);
As a best practise, use the
SAFE
prefix wherever possible to avoid exposing raw data through error messages.
After you create the custom masking routine, it's available as a masking rule in
Create data policies .
Community-contributed functions
Community contributed UDFs are available in the
bigquery-public-data.persistent_udfs public dataset and the open source
bigquery-utils GitHub repository .
You can see all the
community UDFs
in the Google Cloud console by starring
the bigquery-public-data project in the Explorer pane, and then
expanding the nested persistent_udfs dataset within that project.
Allow access to community-contributed functions within a VPC Service Controls perimeter
For projects where VPC Service Controls is enabled and BigQuery is a protected service, you must define an egress rule to the bigquery-public-data project (Project ID: 1057666841514).
This rule must enable the following operations:
bigquery.routines.get (for using routines)
bigquery.tables.getData (for querying BigQuery tables)
The following code shows an example YAML config:
- egressFrom :
identityType : ANY_IDENTITY
egressTo :
operations :
- serviceName : 'bigquery.googleapis.com'
methodSelectors :
- permission : 'bigquery.routines.get'
- permission : 'bigquery.tables.getData'
resources :
- projects/1057666841514 # bigquery-public-data
If you want to contribute to the UDFs in this repository, see
Contributing UDFs
for instructions.
Unified access to routines across multiple regions
To use UDFs in queries across multiple regions, the UDF must be available in every region where a query containing the UDF is run. Therefore, you should create and maintain UDFs in any region where you might use the UDF in a query. Even if your tables are identical, you must maintain 2 versions of the function. For example, if you store your sales data in both the EU and US multi-regions, then you should maintain a version of the function in each region. For example:
A query in EU multi-region:
SELECT
id ,
europe_dataset . my_function ( value )
FROM
sales ;
A query in US multi-region:
SELECT
id ,
us_dataset . my_function ( value )
FROM
sales ;
Additionally, when the definition of the function changes, you must update it in all regions.
To make your UDFs region-independent, you can use cross-region dataset replication :
Create a new dedicated dataset , for example my_utils , to store all your necessary UDFs. Remember that any tables added to this dataset will be replicated, which will increase the cost. However, replicating UDFs and procedures does not incur any additional cost.
Add all your UDF to the new dataset. This can also include community UDFs such as bqutil copied from GitHub .
Enable dataset replication . Configure this dataset to be replicated to all of the regions where you need to execute queries that call these UDFs. This will copy your functions to these regions and keep them synchronized.
When you run a query, BigQuery automatically uses the local version of the UDF from the local dataset replica without your specifying the region where the function is defined, making your queries portable across different locations.
For example:
SELECT
id ,
my_utils . my_function ( value )
FROM
sales ;
Limitations
The following limitations apply to temporary and persistent user-defined functions:
The DOM objects Window , Document , and
Node , and functions that require them, are not supported.
JavaScript functions operate within a sandboxed environment, and those functions that rely on underlying system code might fail due to restricted system calls.
A JavaScript UDF can time out and prevent your query from completing. Timeouts
can be as short as 5 minutes, but can vary depending on several factors,
including how much user CPU time your function consumes and how large your
inputs and outputs to the JavaScript function are.
Bitwise operations in JavaScript handle only the most significant 32 bits.
UDFs are subject to certain rate limits and quota limits. For more information,
see UDF limits .
The following limitations apply to persistent user-defined functions:
Each dataset can only contain one persistent UDF with the same
name. However, you can create a UDF whose name is the same as the name of a
table in the same dataset.
When referencing a persistent UDF from another persistent UDF or a
logical view, you must qualify the name with the dataset. For example:
CREATE FUNCTION mydataset.referringFunction()
AS (mydataset.referencedFunction());
The following limitations apply to temporary user-defined functions.
When creating a temporary UDF, function_name cannot contain
periods.
Views and persistent UDFs cannot reference temporary UDFs.
