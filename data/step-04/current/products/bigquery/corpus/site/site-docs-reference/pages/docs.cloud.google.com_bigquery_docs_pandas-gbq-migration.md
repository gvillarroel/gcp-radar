Use open source Python libraries
You can choose from among three Python libraries in BigQuery,
based on your use case.
Use case
Maintained by
Description
BigQuery DataFrames
Python based data processing and ML operations with server-side processing (for example, using slots)
Google
Pandas and scikit-learn APIs implemented with server-side pushdown. For more information, see Introduction to BigQuery DataFrames .
pandas-gbq
Python based data processing using client side data copy
Open source library maintained by PyData and volunteer contributors
Lets you move data to and from Python DataFrames on the client side. For more information, see the documentation and source code .
google-cloud-bigquery
BigQuery deployment, administration, and SQL-based querying
Open source library maintained by Google
Python package that wraps all the BigQuery APIs. For more information, see the documentation and source code .
Using pandas-gbq and google-cloud-bigquery
The pandas-gbq library provides a simple interface for running queries and
uploading pandas DataFrames to BigQuery. It is a thin wrapper
around the BigQuery client library ,
google-cloud-bigquery . Both of these libraries focus on helping you perform
data analysis using SQL.
Install the libraries
To use the code samples in this guide, install the pandas-gbq package and the
BigQuery Python client libraries.
Install the
pandas-gbq and
google-cloud-bigquery
packages.
pip install -- upgrade pandas - gbq 'google-cloud-bigquery[bqstorage,pandas]'
Running Queries
Both libraries support querying data stored in BigQuery. Key
differences between the libraries include:
pandas-gbq
google-cloud-bigquery
Default SQL syntax
GoogleSQL (configurable with pandas_gbq.context.dialect )
GoogleSQL
Query configurations
Sent as dictionary in the format of a query request .
Use the QueryJobConfig class, which contains properties for the various API configuration options.
Querying data with the GoogleSQL syntax
The following sample shows how to run a GoogleSQL query with and without
explicitly specifying a project. For both libraries, if a project is not
specified, the project will be determined from the
default credentials .
Note: The pandas.read_gbq method defaults to legacy SQL. To use standard
SQL, you must explicitly set the dialect parameter to 'standard' , as
shown.
pandas-gbq :
import pandas
sql = """
SELECT name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
WHERE state = 'TX'
LIMIT 100
"""
# Run a Standard SQL query using the environment's default project
df = pandas . read_gbq ( sql , dialect = "standard" )
# Run a Standard SQL query with the project set explicitly
project_id = "your-project-id"
df = pandas . read_gbq ( sql , project_id = project_id , dialect = "standard" )
google-cloud-bigquery :
from google.cloud import bigquery
client = bigquery . Client ()
sql = """
SELECT name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
WHERE state = 'TX'
LIMIT 100
"""
# Run a Standard SQL query using the environment's default project
df = client . query ( sql ) . to_dataframe ()
# Run a Standard SQL query with the project set explicitly
project_id = "your-project-id"
df = client . query ( sql , project = project_id ) . to_dataframe ()
Querying data with the legacy SQL syntax
The following sample shows how to run a query using legacy SQL syntax. See the
GoogleSQL migration guide
for guidance on updating your queries to GoogleSQL.
pandas-gbq :
import pandas
sql = """
SELECT name
FROM [bigquery-public-data:usa_names.usa_1910_current]
WHERE state = 'TX'
LIMIT 100
"""
df = pandas . read_gbq ( sql , dialect = "legacy" )
google-cloud-bigquery :
from google.cloud import bigquery
client = bigquery . Client ()
sql = """
SELECT name
FROM [bigquery-public-data:usa_names.usa_1910_current]
WHERE state = 'TX'
LIMIT 100
"""
query_config = bigquery . QueryJobConfig ( use_legacy_sql = True )
df = client . query ( sql , job_config = query_config ) . to_dataframe ()
Using the BigQuery Storage API to download large results
Use the BigQuery Storage API to speed up
downloads of large results by 15 to 31
times .
pandas-gbq :
import pandas
sql = "SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_2012`"
# Use the BigQuery Storage API to download results more quickly.
df = pandas . read_gbq ( sql , dialect = "standard" , use_bqstorage_api = True )
google-cloud-bigquery :
from google.cloud import bigquery
client = bigquery . Client ()
sql = "SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_2012`"
# The client library uses the BigQuery Storage API to download results to a
# pandas dataframe if the API is enabled on the project, the
# `google-cloud-bigquery-storage` package is installed, and the `pyarrow`
# package is installed.
df = client . query ( sql ) . to_dataframe ()
Running a query with a configuration
Sending a configuration with a BigQuery API request is required
to perform certain complex operations, such as running a parameterized query or
specifying a destination table to store the query results. In pandas-gbq , the
configuration must be sent as a dictionary in the format of a query request .
In google-cloud-bigquery , job configuration classes are provided, such as
QueryJobConfig ,
which contain the necessary properties to configure complex jobs.
The following sample shows how to run a query with named parameters.
pandas-gbq :
import pandas
sql = """
SELECT name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
WHERE state = @state
LIMIT @limit
"""
query_config = {
"query" : {
"parameterMode" : "NAMED" ,
"queryParameters" : [
{
"name" : "state" ,
"parameterType" : { "type" : "STRING" },
"parameterValue" : { "value" : "TX" },
},
{
"name" : "limit" ,
"parameterType" : { "type" : "INTEGER" },
"parameterValue" : { "value" : 100 },
},
],
}
}
df = pandas . read_gbq ( sql , configuration = query_config )
google-cloud-bigquery :
from google.cloud import bigquery
client = bigquery . Client ()
sql = """
SELECT name
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
WHERE state = @state
LIMIT @limit
"""
query_config = bigquery . QueryJobConfig (
query_parameters = [
bigquery . ScalarQueryParameter ( "state" , "STRING" , "TX" ),
bigquery . ScalarQueryParameter ( "limit" , "INTEGER" , 100 ),
]
)
df = client . query ( sql , job_config = query_config ) . to_dataframe ()
Loading a pandas DataFrame to a BigQuery table
Both libraries support uploading data from a pandas DataFrame to a new table in
BigQuery. Key differences include:
pandas-gbq
google-cloud-bigquery
Type support
Converts the DataFrame to CSV format before sending to the API, which does not support nested or array values.
Converts the DataFrame to Parquet or CSV format before sending to the API, which supports nested and array values. Choose Parquet for struct and array values and CSV for date and time serialization flexibility. Parquet is the default choice. Note that pyarrow , which is the parquet engine used to send the DataFrame data to the BigQuery API, must be installed to load the DataFrame to a table.
Load configurations
You can optionally specify a table schema .
Use the LoadJobConfig class, which contains properties for the various API configuration options.
pandas-gbq :
import pandas
df = pandas . DataFrame (
{
"my_string" : [ "a" , "b" , "c" ],
"my_int64" : [ 1 , 2 , 3 ],
"my_float64" : [ 4.0 , 5.0 , 6.0 ],
"my_timestamp" : [
pandas . Timestamp ( "1998-09-04T16:03:14" ),
pandas . Timestamp ( "2010-09-13T12:03:45" ),
pandas . Timestamp ( "2015-10-02T16:00:00" ),
],
}
)
table_id = "my_dataset.new_table"
df . to_gbq ( table_id )
google-cloud-bigquery :
The google-cloud-bigquery package requires the pyarrow library to serialize
a pandas DataFrame to a Parquet file.
Install the pyarrow package:
pip install pyarrow
from google.cloud import bigquery
import pandas
df = pandas . DataFrame (
{
"my_string" : [ "a" , "b" , "c" ],
"my_int64" : [ 1 , 2 , 3 ],
"my_float64" : [ 4.0 , 5.0 , 6.0 ],
"my_timestamp" : [
pandas . Timestamp ( "1998-09-04T16:03:14" ),
pandas . Timestamp ( "2010-09-13T12:03:45" ),
pandas . Timestamp ( "2015-10-02T16:00:00" ),
],
}
)
client = bigquery . Client ()
table_id = "my_dataset.new_table"
# Since string columns use the "object" dtype, pass in a (partial) schema
# to ensure the correct BigQuery data type.
job_config = bigquery . LoadJobConfig (
schema = [
bigquery . SchemaField ( "my_string" , "STRING" ),
]
)
job = client . load_table_from_dataframe ( df , table_id , job_config = job_config )
# Wait for the load job to complete.
job . result ()
Features not supported by pandas-gbq
While the pandas-gbq library provides a useful interface for querying data
and writing data to tables, it does not cover many of the
BigQuery API features, including but not limited to:
Managing datasets , including
creating new datasets ,
updating dataset properties ,
and deleting datasets
Loading data into BigQuery from
formats other than pandas DataFrames or from pandas DataFrames with JSON
columns
Managing tables , including
listing tables in a dataset ,
copying table data ,
and deleting tables
Exporting BigQuery data
directly to Cloud Storage
Troubleshooting connection pool errors
Error string: Connection pool is full, discarding connection: bigquery.googleapis.com.
Connection pool size: 10
If you use the default BigQuery client object in Python, you are
limited to a maximum of 10 threads because the default pool size for the Python HTTPAdapter
is 10. To use more than 10 connections, create a custom requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter
object. For example:
client = bigquery.Client ()
adapter = requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter ( pool_connections = 128 ,
pool_maxsize = 128 ,max_retries = 3 )
client._http.mount ( "https://" ,adapter )
client._http._auth_request.session.mount ( "https://" ,adapter )
query_job = client.query ( QUERY )
