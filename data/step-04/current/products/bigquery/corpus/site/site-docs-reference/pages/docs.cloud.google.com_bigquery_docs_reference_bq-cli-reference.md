bq command-line tool reference
This document describes the syntax, commands, flags, and arguments for bq ,
the Python-based command-line tool for BigQuery.
For a tutorial on using the bq command-line tool, see
Load and query data with the bq tool .
Ways to use the bq command-line tool
You can enter bq command-line tool commands in Cloud Shell
either from the Google Cloud console or from a local installation of the
Google Cloud CLI .
To use the bq command-line tool from the Google Cloud console, activate
Cloud Shell:
Activate Cloud Shell
To use the bq command-line tool locally, install and configure the
gcloud CLI . To keep your installation
current, see Manage an installation
in the gcloud CLI documentation.
Command format
The bq command-line tool uses the following format:
bq COMMAND [ FLAGS ] [ ARGUMENTS ]
Some flags can be used with multiple bq command-line tool commands; these flags are
described in the Global flags section.
Other flags are command-specific; they can only be used with a particular
bq command-line tool command. The command-specific flags are described in the command
sections.
Specifying values for flags
When you specify a value for a flag, the equals sign ( = ) is optional. For
example, the following two commands are equivalent:
bq ls --format prettyjson myDataset
bq ls --format=prettyjson myDataset
This document uses the equals sign for clarity.
Some bq command-line tool flags are boolean ; you can set the flag's value to either
true or false .
The bq command-line tool accepts the following formats for setting boolean flags.
Value
Format
Example
true
-- FLAGNAME =true
--debug_mode=true
true
-- FLAGNAME
--debug_mode
false
-- FLAGNAME =false
--debug_mode=false
false
--no FLAGNAME
--nodebug_mode
This document uses the -- FLAGNAME = VALUE
format for boolean flags.
All boolean flags are optional; if a boolean flag is not present, then
BigQuery uses the flag's default value.
Specifying BigQuery resources in arguments
The format for specifying a resource depends on the context; in some cases the
separator between the project and dataset is a colon ( : ) and in some cases, it
is a period ( . ). The following table
describes how to specify a BigQuery table in different contexts.
Context
Format
Example
bq command-line tool
PROJECT : DATASET . TABLE
myProject:myDataset.myTable
GoogleSQL query
PROJECT . DATASET . TABLE
myProject.myDataset.myTable
Legacy SQL query
PROJECT : DATASET . TABLE
myProject:myDataset.myTable
If you don't specify a project, then BigQuery uses the current
project. For example, if the current project is myProject , then
BigQuery interprets myDataset.myTable as
myProject:myDataset.myTable (or myProject.myDataset.myTable ).
Some resource identifiers must be quoted using back ticks ( ` ).
If your resource identifier begins with a letter or underscore character, and
contains only characters that are letters, numbers, and underscores, then you
don't need to quote it. However, if your resource identifier
contains other types of
characters, or reserved keywords, you need to surround the identifier (or the
part of the identifier with the special characters or reserved keywords) with
back ticks. For more information, see
Identifiers .
How to run commands
Place any global flags before the bq command, and then
include command-specific flags. You can include multiple global or
command-specific flags. For example:
bq --location=us mk --reservation --project_id=project reservation_name
You can specify command arguments in the following ways:
-- FLAG ARGUMENT (as shown in
the previous examples)
-- FLAG = ARGUMENT
-- FLAG =' ARGUMENT '
-- FLAG =" ARGUMENT "
-- FLAG ' ARGUMENT '
-- FLAG " ARGUMENT "
Replace the following:
FLAG : a global or command-specific flag
ARGUMENT : the flag's argument
Some commands require the use of quotes around arguments. If quotes are
required, either single or double quotes are acceptable. Arguments that
require quotes are typically values that contain spaces, commas, or other
special characters. If your argument contains a BigQuery
resource, be sure to follow the rules for specifying resource names
in commands.
Note: The following examples use the --nouse_legacy_sql flag. This flag is
required to run a GoogleSQL query from the command line unless you
set a default value in .bigqueryrc
or set the configuration setting
default_sql_dialect_option to 'default_legacy_sql' at the project or
organization level.
This example shows how to run a GoogleSQL query on the command line:
bq query --nouse_legacy_sql \
'SELECT
COUNT(*)
FROM
`bigquery-public-data`.samples.shakespeare'
Flags with boolean values can be specified without an argument. If you specify
true or false , then you must use the format
FLAG = ARGUMENT .
For example, this command specifies false for the boolean flag
--use_legacy_sql by placing no at the front of the flag:
bq query --nouse_legacy_sql \
'SELECT
COUNT(*)
FROM
`bigquery-public-data`.samples.shakespeare'
Alternatively, to specify false as the flag's argument, you can enter the
following:
bq query --use_legacy_sql = false \
'SELECT
COUNT(*)
FROM
`bigquery-public-data`.samples.shakespeare'
Run commands in a script
You can run the bq command-line tool in a script, as you would run a
Google Cloud CLI command . The following is an
example of gcloud and bq commands in a bash script:
#!/bin/bash
gcloud config set project myProject
bq query --use_legacy_sql = false --destination_table = myDataset.myTable \
'SELECT
word,
SUM(word_count) AS count
FROM
`bigquery-public-data`.samples.shakespeare
WHERE
word LIKE "%raisin%"
GROUP BY
word'
Use a service account
You can use a service account to make
authorized API calls or run query jobs on your behalf. To use a service account
in the bq command-line tool, authorize access to Google Cloud from the service account.
For more information, see
gcloud auth activate-service-account .
To start running bq commands using
service account impersonation ,
run the following command:
gcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with your service account
name.
bq commands that you run now use the service account credentials.
To stop running bq commands from a service account, run the following command:
gcloud config unset auth/impersonate_service_account
Set default values for command-line flags
You can set default values for command-line flags by including them in the
bq command-line tool's configuration file, .bigqueryrc . Before you configure your
default options, you must first create a .bigqueryrc file. You can use your
preferred text editor to create the file. After you create the .bigqueryrc
file, you can specify the path to the file using the --bigqueryrc global flag.
If the --bigqueryrc flag is not specified, then the BIGQUERYRC environment
variable is used. If that is not specified, then the path ~/.bigqueryrc is
used. The default path is $HOME/.bigqueryrc .
Note: Creating a .bigqueryrc file using the bq init command is not
recommended.
How to add flags to .bigqueryrc
To add default values for command-line flags to .bigqueryrc :
Place global flags
at the top of the file without a header.
For command-specific flags,
enter the command name (in brackets) and add the command-specific flags (one
per line) after the command name.
For example:
--apilog = stdout
--format = prettyjson
--location = US
[ query ]
--use_legacy_sql = false
--max_rows = 100
--maximum_bytes_billed = 10000000
[ load ]
--destination_kms_key = projects/myproject/locations/mylocation/keyRings/myRing/cryptoKeys/myKey
The preceding example sets default values for the following flags:
The global flag --apilog is set to stdout to print debugging output to the
Google Cloud console.
The global flag --format is set to prettyjson to display command output in
a human-readable JSON format.
The global flag --location is set to the US multi-region location.
The query command-specific flag --use_legacy_sql is set to false to make
GoogleSQL the default query syntax.
Note: You cannot use --nouse_legacy_sql in .bigqueryrc .
The query command-specific flag --max_rows is set to 100 to control the
number of rows in the query output.
The query command-specific flag --maximum_bytes_billed is set to
10,000,000 bytes (10 MB) to fail queries that read more than 10 MB of
data.
The load command-specific flag
--destination_kms_key is set
to projects/myproject/locations/mylocation/keyRings/myRing/cryptoKeys/myKey .

Troubleshooting CLI commands
To log requests sent and received:
Add the --apilog= PATH_TO_FILE flag to save a log of
operations to a local file. Replace PATH_TO_FILE with
the location where you want to save the log. The bq command-line tool works by making
standard REST-based API calls, which can be useful to see when troubleshooting.
It's also useful to attach this log when you're reporting issues to
Cloud Customer Care.
Using - or stdout instead of a path prints the log to the Google Cloud console.
Setting --apilog to stderr outputs to the standard error file. To log more
requests, use the --httplib2_debuglevel= LOG_LEVEL flag.
A higher LOG_LEVEL logs more information about the HTTP
requests.
To troubleshoot errors:
Enter the --format=prettyjson flag when you get a
job's status or when you view
detailed information about resources such as tables and datasets. Using this
flag outputs the response in JSON format, including the reason property. You
can use the reason property to find
error messages .
For more information about errors when you run a command, use the
--debug_mode flag.
Global flags
You can use the following flags with any bq command, where applicable:
--api= ENDPOINT
Specifies the API endpoint to call. The default value is
https://www.googleapis.com .
--api_version= VERSION
Specifies the API version to use. The default is v2 .
--apilog= FILE
Logs all API requests and responses to the file specified by
FILE . Possible values are the following:
the path to a file - logs to the specified file
stdout - logs to standard output
stderr - logs to standard error
false - API requests and responses are not logged (default)
--use_google_auth={true|false}
If set to true , enables authentication using Google Auth libraries. The
default value is true .
--bigqueryrc= PATH
Specifies the path to the bq command-line tool configuration file. If you don't specify
the --bigqueryrc flag, then the command uses the BIGQUERYRC environment
variable.
If the environment variable is not set, then $HOME/.bigqueryrc is used.
If that file does not exist, then ~/.bigqueryrc is used. For more
information, see
Setting default values for command-line flags .
--ca_certificates_file= PATH
Specifies the location of your
Certificate Authority Service
(CA) file.
--dataset_id= DATASET_ID
Specifies the default dataset to use with the command. This flag is ignored
when not applicable. You can specify the DATASET_ID
argument using the format
PROJECT : DATASET or
DATASET .
If the PROJECT part is missing, then the default
project
is used. You can override the default project setting by specifying the
--project_id flag .
--debug_mode={true|false}
If set to true , shows tracebacks on Python exceptions. The default value is
false .
--disable_ssl_validation={true|false}
If set to true , enables HTTPS certificate validation. The
default value is false .
--discovery_file= PATH
Specifies the JSON file to read for discovery.
--enable_gdrive={true|false}
If set to false , requests a new OAuth token without Google Drive scope.
The default value is true ; requests a new OAuth token with
Drive scope. To set this flag to false when authenticated
using a user account, the --use_google_auth flag must be set to false .
--fingerprint_job_id={true|false}
To use a job ID that is derived from a
fingerprint of the job configuration, set to true .
This prevents the same job from
running multiple times accidentally. The default value is false .
--format= FORMAT
Specifies the format of the command's output. Use one of the following values:
pretty : formatted table output
sparse : simpler table output
prettyjson : easy-to-read JSON format
json : maximally compact JSON
csv : csv format with header
pretty , sparse , and prettyjson are intended to be human-readable.
json and csv are intended to be used by another program. If none is
specified, then
the command produces no output. If the --format flag is absent, then an
appropriate output format is chosen based on the command.
--headless={true|false}
To run the bq session without user
interaction, set to true . For example,
debug_mode does not break into the debugger, and the frequency of
informational printing is lowered. The default value is false .
--httplib2_debuglevel= DEBUG_LEVEL
Specifies whether to show HTTP debugging information.
If DEBUG_LEVEL
is greater than 0 , then the command logs HTTP server requests and responses to
stderr, in addition to
error messages. If DEBUG_LEVEL is not > 0,
or if the --httplib2_debuglevel flag is not used, then only
error messages are provided.
For example:
--httplib2_debuglevel=1
Note: Multi-level debugging is not supported for this flag, so you can set
DEBUG_LEVEL to any positive number.
--job_id= JOB_ID
Specifies a job identifier for a new job.
This flag applies only to
commands that create jobs: cp , extract , load , and query . If you don't
use the --job_id flag, then the commands generate a unique job identifier.
For more information, see
Running jobs programmatically .
--job_property= KEY : VALUE
A key-value pair to include in the properties
field of the job configuration. Repeat this flag to specify additional
properties.
--location= LOCATION
A string corresponding to a region or multi-region
location .
The location flag is required for the
bq cancel command
and for the bq show
command when you use the --jobs flag to show information about jobs. The
location flag is optional for the following commands:
query
cp
load
extract
partition
update
wait
mk when you use the
--dataset , --reservation , --capacity_commitment ,
or --reservation_assignment flags
ls when you use the --reservation , --capacity_commitment ,
or --reservation_assignment flags
All other commands ignore the --location flag.
Note: The --location flag was introduced in bq version 2.0.29. To verify
the version of the bq command-line tool, enter bq version .
--max_rows_per_request= MAX_ROWS
An integer that specifies the maximum number of rows
to return per read.
--project_id= PROJECT
Specifies the project to use for commands.
--proxy_address= PROXY
Specifies the name or IP address of the proxy host to use for
connecting to Google Cloud.
--proxy_password= PASSWORD
Specifies the password to use when authenticating with the proxy host.
--proxy_port= PORT
Specifies the port number to use to connect to the proxy host.
--proxy_username= USERNAME
Specifies the username to use when authenticating with the proxy
host.
--quiet={true|false} or -q={true|false}
To suppress status updates while jobs are
running, set to true . The default value is false .
--synchronous_mode={true|false} or -sync={true|false}
To create the job and immediately return, with a successful completion status
as the error code,
set to false . If set to true , then the command waits for the job to
complete before returning, and returns the job completion status as the error
code. The default value is true .
--trace=token: TOKEN
Specifies a tracing token to include in API requests.
--use_regional_endpoints={true|false}
In preview . To connect to a regional
endpoint, set the --use_regional_endpoints flag to true and the
--location flag to the region you want to connect to. The
default value is false .
Deprecated global flags
The following global flag for specifying bq command-line tool flags from a file
is
deprecated. To specify flags from a file, use the
--bigqueryrc flag.
--flagfile= PATH
When specified, flag definitions from the supplied file are inserted
into
the bq command-line tool. The default value is '' . For more information, see
Setting default values for command-line flags .

bq help
Use the bq help command to display bq command-line tool documentation within the tool.
Synopsis
bq help [ COMMAND ]
Flags and arguments
The bq help command uses the following flags and arguments:
COMMAND
Specifies a particular bq command-line tool command that you want to get online help
for.
bq insert
Use the bq insert command to insert rows of newline-delimited,
JSON-formatted data into a table from a file using the streaming insert. Data
types are converted to match
the column types of the destination table. This command is intended for testing
purposes only. To stream data into BigQuery, use the
insertAll API method.
Synopsis
bq insert [ FLAGS ] TABLE FILE
Examples
bq insert --ignore_unknown_values --template_suffix = _insert myDataset.myTable /tmp/myData.json
echo '{"a":1, "b":2}' | bq insert myDataset.myTable
Flags and arguments
The bq insert command uses the following flags and arguments:
--ignore_unknown_values={true|false} or -i={true|false}
When set to true , BigQuery ignores any key-value pairs that
don't match the table's schema, and inserts the row with the data that does
match the schema. When set to false , rows with data that doesn't match the
table's schema are not inserted. The default is false .
--skip_invalid_rows={true|false} or -s={true|false}
When set to true , BigQuery attempts to insert any

BUCKET_PATH is the path to the
Cloud Storage bucket that contains the objects represented by
the object table, in the format
gs://bucket_name/[folder_name/]* .You can specify
multiple buckets by providing multiple paths, for example
gs://mybucket1/*,gs://mybucket2/folder5/* .
You can use wildcards to
limit the objects included in the object table. For example, if the
bucket contains several types of unstructured data, you could create
the object table over only PDF objects by specifying
gs://bucket_name/*.pdf . For more information about
using wildcards, see URI wildcards .
The REGION value specifies the
region or multi-region
that contains the connection.
The CONNECTION_NAME value specifies the name of the
cloud resource connection to use with this external table. The connection
determines which service account is used to read data from
Cloud Storage.
--file_set_spec_type= FILE_SET_SPEC_TYPE
Specifies how to interpret source URIs.
FILE_SYSTEM_MATCH : Expands source URIs by listing files from the object
store. This is the default behavior if FileSetSpecType is not set.
NEW_LINE_DELIMITED_MANIFEST : Indicates that the provided URIs are
newline-delimited manifest files, with one URI per line. Wildcard URIs are
not supported in the manifest files, and all referenced data files must be
in the same bucket as the manifest.
For example, if you have a source URI of "gs://bucket/path/file"
and the file_set_spec_type is FILE_SYSTEM_MATCH , then the
file is used directly as a data file. If the file_set_spec_type
is NEW_LINE_DELIMITED_MANIFEST , then each line in the file is interpreted
as a URI that points to a data file.
--reference_file_schema_uri= URI
Specifies the path to a reference file with the expected table schema for
creating external tables. Equivalent to
ExternalDataConfiguration.referenceFileSchemaUri .
This flag is enabled for Avro, ORC, and PARQUET formats.
--label= KEY : VALUE
Specifies a label for the table. Repeat this flag to specify multiple
labels.
--max_staleness= INTERVAL
Specifies whether cached metadata is used by operations against the
table, and how fresh the cached metadata must be in order for the operation to
use it.
Applicable for BigLake tables
and object tables .
To disable metadata caching, specify 0. This is the default.
To enable metadata caching, specify an interval value between 30
minutes and 7 days, using the Y-M D H:M:S format described in the
INTERVAL data type
documentation. For example, specify 0-0 0 4:0:0 for a 4 hour staleness
interval. With this value, operations against the table use cached metadata if
it has been refreshed within the past 4 hours. If the cached metadata
is older than that, the operation falls back to retrieving metadata from
Cloud Storage instead.
--object_metadata= STRING
Set the value of this flag to SIMPLE when creating an
object table .
Only required when creating an
object table .
--range_partitioning= COLUMN_NAME , START , END , INTERVAL
Specifies options for an integer-range partition, as follows:
column_name is the column used to create the integer range partitions.
start is the start of range partitioning, inclusive.

--schema=/tmp/tabledef
--schema=Region:STRING,Quarter:STRING,Total_sales:INTEGER
--time_partitioning_expiration= SECONDS
An integer that specifies (in seconds) when
a time-based partition should be deleted. The expiration time evaluates to the
partition's UTC date plus the integer value. A negative number indicates no
expiration.
--time_partitioning_field= COLUMN_NAME
Specifies the field used to determine how to create a
time-based partition. If time-based partitioning is enabled without this
value, then
the table is partitioned based on the load time.
--time_partitioning_type= INTERVAL
Enables time-based partitioning on a table and sets the partition type.
Use one of the following values:
DAY
HOUR
MONTH
YEAR
--use_avro_logical_types={true|false}
If the FORMAT part of the
--external_table_definition flag
is set to AVRO , then this flag specifies
whether to convert
logical types into their corresponding types (such as TIMESTAMP ) instead of
only using their raw types (such as INTEGER ).
--parquet_enable_list_inference={true|false}
If the FORMAT part of the
--external_table_definition flag
is set to PARQUET , then this flag
specifies whether to use
schema inference
for Parquet LIST logical types.

evaluates to the partition's UTC date plus the integer value. A negative
number indicates no expiration.
--time_partitioning_field= COLUMN_NAME
Use with the --destination_table flag. Specifies the partitioning column for
time-based partitioning. If time-based partitioning is enabled without this
value, then the table is partitioned based on the ingestion time.

limit is exceeded, BigQuery attempts to stop the job.
QUERY
The query that you want to run. You can specify the query by using one of the
following methods:
Specify a string that contains the query.
If you need to use additional string literals within the query, you
must follow the quoting rules for the shell that you are using, such as
Bash or
PowerShell .
The following example shows a typical approach in Bash, which is to use
double quotes to denote the string literals in the query, and then
enclose the query itself in single quotes:
'SELECT * FROM mydataset.mytable WHERE column1 = "value";'
If you are copying the query from another location, you must also remove
any comments in the query.
Pass in a SQL script that contains the query. The following example
shows how to pass in a SQL script in the Bash shell:
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < query.sql
For more information about using the bq query command, see
Run a query .

bq set-iam-policy
Use the bq set-iam-policy command to specify or update the
IAM policy
for a resource. The resource can be a table, a view, or a
slot reservation .
After setting the policy, the new policy is
printed to stdout . The policy is in JSON format.
The etag field in the updated policy must match the etag value of the
current policy, otherwise the update fails. This feature prevents concurrent
updates.
You can obtain the current policy and etag value for a resource by using the
bq get-iam-policy command.
Note: bq set-iam-policy does not support datasets. To modify access to a dataset, see Grant access to a dataset or Revoke access to a dataset .
