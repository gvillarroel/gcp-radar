Use custom holidays in an ARIMA_PLUS time-series forecasting model
This tutorial shows you how to do the following tasks:
Create an
ARIMA_PLUS time-series forecasting model
that uses only built-in holidays.
Create an ARIMA_PLUS time-series forecasting model that uses custom
holidays in addition to built-in holidays.
Visualize the forecasted results from these models.
Inspect a model to see which holidays it models.
Evaluate the effects of the custom holidays on the forecasted results.
Compare the performance of the model that uses only built-in holidays to the
performance of the model that uses custom holidays in addition to
built-in holidays.
This tutorial uses the bigquery-public-data.wikipedia.pageviews_*
public tables.

Prepare the time-series data
Aggregate the Wikipedia page view data for the
Google I/O page into a single
table, grouped by day:
Go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the SQL editor pane, run the following SQL statement:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `bqml_tutorial.googleio_page_views`
AS
SELECT
DATETIME_TRUNC ( datehour , DAY ) AS date ,
SUM ( views ) AS views
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.wikipedia.pageviews_*`
WHERE
datehour >= '2017-01-01'
AND datehour '2023-01-01'
AND title = 'Google_I/O'
GROUP BY
DATETIME_TRUNC ( datehour , DAY )
Create a time-series forecasting model that uses built-in holidays
Create a model that forecasts daily page views for the Wikipedia
"Google I/O" page, based on page
view data before 2022 and taking built-in holidays into account:
Go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the SQL editor pane, run the following SQL statement:
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.forecast_googleio`
OPTIONS (
model_type = 'ARIMA_PLUS' ,
holiday_region = 'US' ,
time_series_timestamp_col = 'date' ,
time_series_data_col = 'views' ,
data_frequency = 'DAILY' ,
horizon = 365 )
AS
SELECT
*
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.googleio_page_views`
WHERE
date '2022-01-01' ;
Visualize the forecasted results
After you create the model using built-in holidays, join the original data from
the bqml_tutorial.googleio_page_views table with the forecasted value from the
ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST function ,
and then visualize it by
using Data Studio :
Go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the SQL editor pane, run the following SQL statement:
SELECT
original . date ,
original . views AS original_views ,
explain_forecast . time_series_adjusted_data
AS adjusted_views_without_custom_holiday ,
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.googleio_page_views` original
INNER JOIN
(
SELECT
*
FROM
ML . EXPLAIN_FORECAST (
MODEL `bqml_tutorial.forecast_googleio` ,
STRUCT ( 365 AS horizon ))
) explain_forecast
ON
TIMESTAMP ( original . date )
= explain_forecast . time_series_timestamp
ORDER BY
original . date ;
In the Query results pane, click Open in >
Data Studio . Data Studio
opens in a new tab.
In the Data Studio tab, click Add a chart , and then
click the time series chart:
Place the chart on the report.
On the Setup tab of the Chart pane, click Add metric and select
adjusted_views_without_custom_holiday :
The chart looks similar to the following:
You can see that the forecasting model captures the general trend pretty
well. However, it isn't capturing the increased traffic related to previous
Google I/O events, and it isn't able to generate an accurate forecast for
The next sections show you how to deal with some of these
limitations.
Create a time-series forecasting model that uses built-in holidays and custom holidays
As you can see in
Google I/O history ,
the Google I/O event occurred on different dates between 2017 and 2022. To take
this variation into account, create a model that forecasts page views for the
Wikipedia "Google_I/O" page through 2022, based on page view data from before
2022, and using custom holidays to represent the Google I/O event each year.
In this model, you also adjust the holiday effect window to cover three days
around the event date, to better capture some potential page traffic before
and after the event.
Go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the SQL editor pane, run the following SQL statement:
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.forecast_googleio_with_custom_holiday`
OPTIONS (
model_type = 'ARIMA_PLUS' ,
holiday_region = 'US' ,
time_series_timestamp_col = 'date' ,
time_series_data_col = 'views' ,
data_frequency = 'DAILY' ,
horizon = 365 )
AS (
training_data AS (
SELECT
*
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.googleio_page_views`
WHERE
date '2022-01-01'
),
custom_holiday AS (
SELECT
'US' AS region ,
'GoogleIO' AS holiday_name ,
primary_date ,
1 AS preholiday_days ,
2 AS postholiday_days
FROM
UNNEST (
[
DATE ( '2017-05-17' ),
DATE ( '2018-05-08' ),
DATE ( '2019-05-07' ),
-- cancelled in 2020 due to pandemic
DATE ( '2021-05-18' ),
DATE ( '2022-05-11' ) ] )
AS primary_date
)
);
Visualize the forecasted results
After you create the model using custom holidays, join the original data from
the bqml_tutorial.googleio_page_views table with the forecasted value from the
ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST function ,
and then visualize it by
using Data Studio :
Go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the SQL editor pane, run the following SQL statement:
SELECT
original . date ,
original . views AS original_views ,

) explain_forecast
ON
TIMESTAMP ( original . date )
= explain_forecast . time_series_timestamp
ORDER BY
original . date ;
In the Query results pane, click Explore data ,
and then click Explore with Data Studio . Data Studio
opens in a new tab.
In the Data Studio tab, click Add a chart , click the
time series chart, and place the chart on the report.
On the Setup tab of the Chart pane, click Add metric and select
adjusted_views_with_custom_holiday .
The chart looks similar to the following:
As you can see, the custom holidays boosted the performance
of the forecasting model. It now effectively captures the increase of page
views caused by Google I/O.
Inspect holiday information
Inspect the list of holidays that were taken into account during modeling
by using the
ML.HOLIDAY_INFO function :
Go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the SQL editor pane, run the following SQL statement:
SELECT *
FROM
ML . HOLIDAY_INFO (
MODEL `bqml_tutorial.forecast_googleio_with_custom_holiday` );
The results show both Google I/O and the built-in holidays in the list
of holidays:
Evaluate the effects of the custom holidays
Evaluate the effects of the custom holidays on the forecasted results by
using the
ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST function :
Go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the SQL editor pane, run the following SQL statement:
SELECT
time_series_timestamp ,
holiday_effect_GoogleIO ,
holiday_effect_US_Juneteenth ,
holiday_effect_Christmas ,
holiday_effect_NewYear
FROM
ML . EXPLAIN_FORECAST (
model
`bqml_tutorial.forecast_googleio_with_custom_holiday` ,
STRUCT ( 365 AS horizon ))
WHERE holiday_effect != 0 ;
The results show that Google I/O contributes a large amount of holiday
effect to the forecasted results:
Compare model performance
Use the
ML.EVALUATE function
to compare the performance of the first model created without custom holidays
and the second model created with custom holidays. To see how the second
model performs when it comes to forecasting a future custom holiday, set the
time range to the week of Google I/O in 2022:
Go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
In the SQL editor pane, run the following SQL statement:
SELECT
"original" AS model_type ,
*
FROM
ml . evaluate (
MODEL `bqml_tutorial.forecast_googleio` ,
(
SELECT
*
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.googleio_page_views`
WHERE
date >= '2022-05-08'
AND date '2022-05-12'
),
STRUCT (
365 AS horizon ,
TRUE AS perform_aggregation ))
UNION ALL
SELECT
"with_custom_holiday" AS model_type ,
*
FROM
ml . evaluate (
MODEL
`bqml_tutorial.forecast_googleio_with_custom_holiday` ,
(
SELECT
*
FROM
`bqml_tutorial.googleio_page_views`
WHERE
date >= '2022-05-08'
AND date '2022-05-12'
),
STRUCT (
365 AS horizon ,
TRUE AS perform_aggregation ));
The results show that the second model offers a significant performance
improvement:
