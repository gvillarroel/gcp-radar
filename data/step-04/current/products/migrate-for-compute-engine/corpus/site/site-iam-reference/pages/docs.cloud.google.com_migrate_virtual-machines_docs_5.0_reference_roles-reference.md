Roles and permissions reference
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document contains a reference for the different roles and permissions
required by Migrate to Virtual Machines. In Google Cloud, roles and permissions
are typically associated with service account
or user account .
The following sections describes these roles and permissions
organized by the major components of Migrate to Virtual Machines:
Google Cloud console user accounts
Migrate to Virtual Machines default service account
Target project service account
In addition, Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)
includes two predefined roles that you can use to control access for users in
your organization.
Role
Title
Description
roles/vmmigration.admin
VM Migration Administrator
Allows users to create new Migrate to Virtual Machines sources and perform all other migration operations.
roles/vmmigration.viewer
VM Migration Viewer
Allows users to retrieve information about Migrate to Virtual Machines in the
Google Cloud console. Intended for users who monitor migrations but don't
perform them.
For example, if you want to allow a user in your organization to be able to view
information about a migration, but not be able to perform a migration, assign them
the role roles/vmmigration.viewer .
Google Cloud console user accounts
A Migrate to Virtual Machines target project defines the destination project for a
Compute Engine instance running your migrated VM. The Migrate to Virtual Machines
host project can be used as a target project. If you want to migrate VMs to
additional projects, you must add them as target projects to
Migrate to Virtual Machines.
For a user to be able to add a target project, and to configure the
details of the Compute Engine instance on the target project, that user
requires the necessary Identity and Access Management (IAM)
roles and permissions.
Because you perform these actions in the Google Cloud console , the user account that
requires these permissions is the account that you use to sign in to the
Google Cloud console:
To add a target project to Migrate to Virtual Machines, the user account you use
to sign in to the Google Cloud console requires the permissions described in
Permissions to add a target project .
To configure the target details of the Compute Engine instance running
on the target project, the user account you use to sign in to the
Google Cloud console requires permissions to access data in the target project,
such as networks, instance types, and more. See Permissions to configure a target instance .
Depending on how you configure IAM for your environment,
you might configure a single user to perform both actions, or configure two
separate users.
Permissions to add a target project
To add a target project, the user account you use to sign in to the
Google Cloud console requires:
The role vmmigration.admin on the host project
The role resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin on the target project
Note: If your user account does not
have the resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin role on the target project, or
you are forbidden from adding it for security reasons, you can still add
the target project. However, a warning icon, warning ,
appears next to the project name when you add it and you won't be able
to deploy Compute Engine instances on the target project.
As a workaround, contact the security administrator for the target
project to get your user account configured with the
resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin role, and then try to add the target
project.
Alternatively, after you add the target project, assign the role
vmmigration.serviceAgent on the target project to the Migrate to Virtual Machines
default service account.
See Configuring permissions on host project default service account for instructions on setting these permissions.
Permissions to configure target details for a Compute Engine instance
To configure the target details of the Compute Engine instance on the target
project, the user account you use to sign in on the Google Cloud console requires:
The role roles/compute.viewer on the target project
Note: If your environment uses a Shared VPC ,
then the user account also requires this permission on the
Shared VPC host project .
See Configuring permissions on host project default service account for instructions on setting these permissions.
Migrate to Virtual Machines default service account
Migrate to Virtual Machines creates a default service account on the host project
when you enable the Migrate to Virtual Machines API, and assigns it the role
vmmigration.serviceAgent . Migrate to Virtual Machines uses this service account to
create the Compute Engine instance on the target project as part of test-clone
and cut over.
Depending on your environment, you might have to edit the permissions on the
default service account.
Permissions when using a Shared VPC on the target project
To deploy a Compute Engine instance to a target project that accesses a
Shared VPC, you must add the compute.networkUser role to the
Migrate to Virtual Machines default service account to allow it access to subnetworks
in the Shared VPC host project.
See Configuring permissions for a Shared VPC
for instructions on setting these permissions.
Target project service account
By default, when you deploy your migrated VM to a target Compute Engine
instance, no service account is assigned to the instance.
If the Compute Engine instance requires access to Google Cloud
services and APIs, create a service account
in the target project with the necessary permissions to access those services
and APIs. Then, attach the service account to the Compute Engine instance as
part of configuring the target details.
However, to attach the target service account to the Compute Engine instance,
the Migrate to Virtual Machines default service account requires the necessary
permissions, as described in Configuring permissions on target project service account .
Permissions to configure AWS as a source
This section details the fields of the permissions JSON template. For details
on how to implement migration permissions review the Create an AWS IAM policy section.
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"ec2:DescribeInstances",
"ec2:DescribeVolumes",

}
}
}
]
}
To show the inventory of the migration candidate instances grant Migrate to Virtual Machines
permissions for ec2:DescribeInstances, ec2:DescribeVolumes and
ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes .
Migrate to Virtual Machines requires the following permissions to migrate EC2 volumes
from AWS to Google Cloud:
To create a snapshot of the volumes, grant permissions for ec2:DescribeSnapshots,
ec2:CreateSnapshots , and ec2:CreateTags .
To copy the data to Google Cloud grant permissions for ebs:ListSnapshotBlocks,
ebs:ListChangedBlocks , and ebs:GetSnapshotBlock .
To delete old snapshots grant permissions for ec2:DeleteSnapshot and
ec2:DeleteTags .
To perform a cutover grant Migrate to Virtual Machines permissions for ec2:StopInstances .
Permissions to configure Azure as a source
This section describes the fields of the permissions JSON template. For details
on how to implement migration permissions, review the Create a custom role section.
The following permissions are required to create a resource group associated with
the source, verify that it exists, list the resources it contains, and delete it
when the source is deleted:
"Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write",
"Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
"Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/delete"
The following permission is required in order to obtain the inventory list and
to get the details of the VMs that are being migrated:
"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read"
The following permission is required to deallocate a VM when it is being cut over
into a Google Cloud VM:
"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deallocate/action"
The following permissions are required to create, list, and delete snapshots /
restore points of the VM being migrated:
"Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/read",
"Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/write",
"Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/delete",
"Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/restorePoints/read",
"Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/restorePoints/write",
"Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/restorePoints/delete",
"Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/delete",
"Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/write",
"Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/read"
The following permissions are required for reading snapshot / restore point data:
"Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/restorePoints/diskRestorePoints/read",
"Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/restorePoints/diskRestorePoints/beginGetAccess/action",
"Microsoft.Compute/restorePointCollections/restorePoints/diskRestorePoints/endGetAccess/action",
"Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/beginGetAccess/action",
"Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/endGetAccess/action"
Grant network access
In addition to granting permissions, you must verify that access to your disks
is not blocked or restricted to any specific network. Your disks must be
accessible to public networks.
To ensure that your disks are accessible to public networks, use the following
steps:
In your Azure account, go to your disk settings.
In Settings , open the Networking page.
Select Enable public access from all networks .
Click Save .
For more information, see Managing network access for managed disks .
