Device attributes collected by Endpoint Verification
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the details of device attributes that are collected by
Endpoint Verification from the devices accessing your organization's resources.
Endpoint Verification collects
device attributes ,

Chrome browser attributes .
Note: You can also use Chrome Enterprise Premium and third-party client integrations
to collect device attributes from third-party clients, such as Tanium,
CrowdStrike, and Microsoft Intune.

Configurable device attributes
Endpoint Verification provides an option to collect granular device attributes called
configurable device attributes , such as metadata attributes of files, folders,
and binaries; registry entries; and properties in a plist.
You can use these device configuration attributes to create access levels.
This option is not enabled by default. To collect these granular configurable
device attributes,
configure Endpoint Verification settings .
Note: The Endpoint Verification native helper runs in the user space, as the signed-in user. It can only detect files, folders, and processes that are visible and accessible to the current user.
The following table describes the file, folder, and binary attributes.
Note: config_name is the name of the configuration that you specified when
configuring the Endpoint Verification settings.
