The Group API lets you inspect and manage your
groups <#google.monitoring.v3.Group> __.
A group is a named filter that is used to identify a collection of
monitored resources. Groups are typically used to mirror the
physical and/or logical topology of the environment. Because group
membership is computed dynamically, monitored resources that are
started in the future are automatically placed in matching groups.
By using a group to name monitored resources in, for example, an
alert policy, the target of that alert policy is updated
automatically as monitored resources are added and removed from the
infrastructure.
Properties
api_endpoint
Return the API endpoint used by the client instance.

Methods
GroupServiceClient
GroupServiceClient (
* ,
credentials : typing . Optional [ google . auth . credentials . Credentials ] = None ,
transport : typing . Optional [
typing . Union [
str ,
google . cloud . monitoring_v3 . services . group_service . transports . base . GroupServiceTransport ,
typing . Callable [

] = None ,
client_info : google . api_core . gapic_v1 . client_info . ClientInfo = google . api_core . gapic_v1 . client_info . ClientInfo
)
Instantiates the group service client.
Parameters
Name
Description
credentials
Optional[google.auth.credentials.Credentials]
The authorization credentials to attach to requests. These credentials identify the application to the service; if none are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the credentials from the environment.
transport
Optional[Union[str,GroupServiceTransport,Callable[..., GroupServiceTransport]]]
The transport to use, or a Callable that constructs and returns a new transport. If a Callable is given, it will be called with the same set of initialization arguments as used in the GroupServiceTransport constructor. If set to None, a transport is chosen automatically.
client_options
Optional[Union[google.api_core.client_options.ClientOptions, dict]]
Custom options for the client. 1. The api_endpoint property can be used to override the default endpoint provided by the client when transport is not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and transport was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment variable, which have one of the following values: "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is the default value). 2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable is "true", then the client_cert_source property can be used to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not set, no client certificate will be used. 3. The universe_domain property can be used to override the default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that the api_endpoint property still takes precedence; and universe_domain is currently not supported for mTLS.
client_info
google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo
The client info used to send a user-agent string along with API requests. If None , then default info will be used. Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing your own client library.
Exceptions
Type
Description
google.auth.exceptions.MutualTLSChannelError
If mutual TLS transport creation failed for any reason.
__exit__
__exit__ ( type , value , traceback )
Releases underlying transport's resources.
Warning:
ONLY use as a context manager if the transport is NOT shared
with other clients! Exiting the with block will CLOSE the transport
and may cause errors in other clients!
common_billing_account_path
common_billing_account_path ( billing_account : str ) - > str
Returns a fully-qualified billing_account string.
common_folder_path
common_folder_path ( folder : str ) - > str

Parameters
Name
Description
request
Union[ google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.CreateGroupRequest , dict]
The request object. The CreateGroup request.
name
str
Required. The project https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3#project_name __ in which to create the group. The format is: :: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER] This corresponds to the name field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set.
group
google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.Group
Required. A group definition. It is an error to define the name field because the system assigns the name. This corresponds to the group field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set.
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry
Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
timeout
float
The timeout for this request.
metadata
Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]
Key/value pairs which should be sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type str , but for metadata keys ending with the suffix -bin , the corresponding values must be of type bytes .
Returns
Type
Description
google.cloud.monitoring_v3.types.Group
The description of a dynamic collection of monitored resources. Each group has a filter that is matched against monitored resources and their associated metadata. If a group's filter matches an available monitored resource, then that resource is a member of that group. Groups can contain any number of monitored resources, and each monitored resource can be a member of any number of groups. Groups can be nested in parent-child hierarchies. The parentName field identifies an optional parent for each group. If a group has a parent, then the only monitored resources available to be matched by the group's filter are the resources contained in the parent group. In other words, a group contains the monitored resources that match its filter and the filters of all the group's ancestors. A group without a parent can contain any monitored resource. For example, consider an infrastructure running a set of instances with two user-defined tags: "environment" and "role". A parent group has a filter, environment="production". A child of that parent group has a filter, role="transcoder". The parent group contains all instances in the production environment, regardless of their roles. The child group contains instances that have the transcoder role *and* are in the production environment. The monitored resources contained in a group can change at any moment, depending on what resources exist and what filters are associated with the group and its ancestors.

The description of a dynamic collection of monitored resources. Each group has a filter that is matched against monitored resources and their associated metadata. If a group's filter matches an available monitored resource, then that resource is a member of that group. Groups can contain any number of monitored resources, and each monitored resource can be a member of any number of groups. Groups can be nested in parent-child hierarchies. The parentName field identifies an optional parent for each group. If a group has a parent, then the only monitored resources available to be matched by the group's filter are the resources contained in the parent group. In other words, a group contains the monitored resources that match its filter and the filters of all the group's ancestors. A group without a parent can contain any monitored resource. For example, consider an infrastructure running a set of instances with two user-defined tags: "environment" and "role". A parent group has a filter, environment="production". A child of that parent group has a filter, role="transcoder". The parent group contains all instances in the production environment, regardless of their roles. The child group contains instances that have the transcoder role *and* are in the production environment. The monitored resources contained in a group can change at any moment, depending on what resources exist and what filters are associated with the group and its ancestors.
