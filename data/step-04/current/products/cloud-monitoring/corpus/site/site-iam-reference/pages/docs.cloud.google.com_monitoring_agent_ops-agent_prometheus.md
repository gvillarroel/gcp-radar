Collect Prometheus metrics
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the configuration and use of an Ops Agent
metrics receiver that you can use to collect metrics from Prometheus on
Compute Engine. This document also describes an
example that you can use to try the receiver.
Users of Google Kubernetes Engine have been able to collect
Prometheus metrics by using Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus .
The Ops Agent Prometheus receiver gives users of Compute Engine the
same capability.
You can use all of the tools provided by Cloud Monitoring, including PromQL, to view and analyze the data collected by the Prometheus receiver.
For example, you can use Metrics Explorer ,
as described in Google Cloud console for
Monitoring , to query your data.
You can also create Cloud Monitoring dashboards and
alerting policies to monitor your Prometheus metrics.
We recommend using PromQL as the query language for your Prometheus metrics.
You can also view your Prometheus metrics in interfaces outside
Cloud Monitoring, like the Prometheus UI and
Grafana .
Choose the right receiver
Before you decide to use the Prometheus receiver, determine if
there is already an Ops Agent integration for the application you
are using. For information on the existing integrations with the Ops Agent,
see Monitoring third-party applications .
If there is an existing integration, we recommend using it. For more
information, see Choosing an existing integration .
We recommend using the Ops Agent Prometheus receiver when the following
are true:
You have experience using Prometheus, rely on the Prometheus standard,
and understand how factors like scraping interval and cardinality can
affect your costs. For more information, see Choosing the Prometheus
receiver .
The software you are monitoring isn't already part of the
set of existing Ops Agent integrations .
Existing integrations
The Ops Agent provides integrations for a number of
third-party applications .
These integrations provide the following for you:
A set of selected workload.googleapis.com metrics for the application
A dashboard for visualizing the metrics.
The metrics ingested by using an existing integration
are subject to byte-based pricing for agent-collected metrics. For information
about this pricing, see Google Cloud Observability pricing .
The number and types of the metrics is known in advance, and you can
use that information to estimate costs.
For example, if you are using the
Apache Web Server (httpd) integration , the Ops Agent
collects five scalar metrics ; each data point counts as
8 bytes. If you keep
the Ops Agent default sampling frequency of 60 seconds, the number
of bytes ingested per day is 57,600 * the number of hosts:
8 (bytes) * 1440 (minutes per day) * 5 (metrics) * n (hosts), or
57,600 * n (hosts)
For more information about estimating costs,
see Pricing examples based on bytes ingested .
The Prometheus receiver
When you use the Ops Agent to collect Prometheus metrics, the following
apply:
The number and cardinality of metrics emitted by your application are
under your control. There is no curated set of metrics. How much data
you ingest is determined by the configuration of your Prometheus application
and the Ops Agent Prometheus receiver.
Metrics are ingested into Cloud Monitoring as prometheus.googleapis.com
metrics. These metrics are classified as a type of "custom" metrics when
ingested into Cloud Monitoring and are subject to the
quotas and limits for custom metrics.
You must design and create any Cloud Monitoring dashboards you need,
based on the set of metrics you are ingesting and on your business needs.
For information about creating dashboards, see
Dashboards and charts .
Pricing for metric ingestion is based on the number of samples ingested.
To estimate your costs when using the Prometheus receiver, you need to
determine the number of samples you are likely to collect during a
billing cycle. The estimate is based on the following factors:
Number of scalar metrics; each value is one sample
Number of distribution metrics; each histogram counts as (2 + number of
buckets in the histogram) samples
Sampling frequency of each metric
Number of hosts from which the metrics are sampled
For more information about pricing, see Google Cloud Observability pricing . For examples, see
Pricing examples based on samples ingested .
Prerequisites
To collect Prometheus metrics by using the Prometheus receiver, you must
install the Ops Agent version
2.25.0 or higher.
The Ops Agent receiver requires an endpoint that emits Prometheus metrics.
Therefore, your application must either provide such an endpoint directly or
use a Prometheus library or exporter to expose an endpoint.
Many libraries and language frameworks like Spring and DropWizard, or
applications like StatsD, DogStatsD, and Graphite, that emit non-Prometheus
metrics can use Prometheus client libraries or exporters to emit
Prometheus-style metrics. For example, to emit Prometheus metrics:
Spring users can use the Spring Metrics
library.
StatsD users can use the
statsd_exporter package.
Graphite users can use the
graphite_exporter package.
When Prometheus metrics are emitted by an application, directly or by using
a library or exporter, the metrics can then be collected by an
Ops Agent configured with a Prometheus receiver.
Configure the Ops Agent
The Ops Agent configuration model typically involves
defining the following:
Receivers , which determine which metrics are collected.
Processors , which describe how the Ops Agent can modify the metrics.
Pipelines , which link receivers and processors together into a service .
The configuration for ingesting Prometheus metrics is slightly
different: there are no processors involved.
Configuration for Prometheus metrics
Configuring the Ops Agent to ingest Prometheus metrics differs from
the usual configuration as follows:
You don't create an Ops Agent processor for Prometheus metrics. The
Prometheus receiver supports nearly all of the configuration options
specified by the Prometheus
scrape_config specification , including relabeling
options.
Instead of using an Ops Agent processor, any metrics processing is done by
using the relabel_configs and metric_relabel_configs
sections of the scape config, as specified in the Prometheus receiver.
For more information, see Relabeling: Modifying the data being
scraped .
You define the Prometheus pipeline in terms of the Prometheus receiver only.
You don't specify any processors. You also can't use any non-Prometheus
receivers in the pipeline for Prometheus metrics.
The majority of the receiver configuration is the specification of scrape-config
options. Omitting those options for brevity, the following shows the structure
of an Ops Agent configuration that uses a Prometheus receiver. You specify the
values of the RECEIVER_ID and PIPELINE_ID .
metrics:
receivers:
RECEIVER_ID :
type: prometheus
config:
scrape_configs:
[... omitted for brevity ...]
service:
pipelines:
PIPELINE_ID :
receivers: [ RECEIVER_ID ]
The following section describes the Prometheus receiver in more detail.
For a functional example of a receiver and pipeline,
see Add the Ops Agent receiver and pipeline .
The Prometheus receiver
To specify a receiver for Prometheus metrics, you create a metrics
receiver of type prometheus and specify a set of scrape_config options.
The receiver supports all of the Prometheus
scrape_config options,
with the exception of the following:
The service-discovery sections, *_sd_config .
The honor_labels setting.
Therefore, you can copy over existing scrape configs and use them for the
Ops Agent with little or no modification.
The full structure of the Prometheus receiver is shown in the following:
metrics:
receivers:
prom_application:
type: prometheus
config:
scrape_configs:
- job_name: ' STRING ' # must be unique across all Prometheus receivers
scrape_interval: # duration, like 10m or 15s
scrape_timeout: # duration, like 10m or 15s
metrics_path: # resource path for metrics, default = /metrics
honor_timestamps: # boolean, default = false
scheme: # http or https, default = http
params:
- STRING : STRING
basic_auth:
username: STRING
password: SECRET
password_file: STRING
authorization:
type: STRING # default = Bearer
credentials: SECRET
credentials_file: FILENAME
oauth2: OAUTH2 # See Prometheus oauth2
follow_redirects: # boolean, default = true
enable_http2: # boolean, default = true
tls_config: TLS_CONFIG # See Prometheus tls_config
proxy_url: STRING
static_configs:
STATIC_CONFIG # See Prometheus static_config
relabel_configs:
RELABEL_CONFIG # See Prometheus relabel_config
metric_relabel_configs:
METRIC_RELABEL_CONFIGS # See Prometheus metric_relabel_configs
For examples of relabeling configs, see Additional receiver
configuration .
Example: Configure the Ops Agent for Prometheus
This section shows an example of how to configure the Ops Agent to collect
Prometheus metrics from an application. This example uses the Prometheus
community-provided JSON Exporter
( json_exporter ), which
exposes Prometheus metrics on port 7979.
Setting up the example requires the following resources, which
you might have to install:
git
curl
make
python3
Go language, version 1.19 or higher
Create or configure your application
To obtain and run the JSON Exporter, use the following procedure:
Clone the json_exporter repository and check out the exporter by
running the following commands:
git clone https://github.com/prometheus-community/json_exporter.git
cd json_exporter
git checkout v0.5.0
Build the exporter by running the following command:
make build
Start the Python HTTP server by running the following command:
python3 -m http.server 8000 &
Start the JSON Exporter by running the following command:
./json_exporter --config.file examples/config.yml &
Query the JSON Exporter to verify that it is running and exposing
metrics on port 7979:
curl "http://localhost:7979/probe?module=default&target=http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json"
If the query was successful, then you see output that resembles the
following:
# HELP example_global_value Example of a top-level global value scrape in the json
# TYPE example_global_value untyped
example_global_value{environment="beta",location="planet-mars"} 1234
# HELP example_value_active Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json
# TYPE example_value_active untyped
example_value_active{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1
example_value_active{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 1
# HELP example_value_boolean Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json
# TYPE example_value_boolean untyped
example_value_boolean{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1
example_value_boolean{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 0
# HELP example_value_count Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json
# TYPE example_value_count untyped
example_value_count{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1
example_value_count{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 3
In this output, the strings like example_value_active are the metric
names, with labels and values in braces. The data value follows
the label set.
Add the Ops Agent receiver and pipeline
To configure the Ops Agent to ingest metrics from the JSON Exporter
application, you must modify the agent's configuration to add a
Prometheus receiver and pipeline. For the JSON Exporter example,
use the following procedure:
Edit the Ops Agent configuration file,
/etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml , and add the following Prometheus
receiver and pipeline entries:
metrics:
receivers:
prometheus:
type: prometheus
config:
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'json_exporter'
scrape_interval: 10s
metrics_path: /probe
params:
module: [default]
target: [http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json]
static_configs:
- targets: ['localhost:7979']
service:
pipelines:
prometheus_pipeline:
receivers:
- prometheus
If you have other configuration entries in this file already, add the
Prometheus receiver and pipeline to the existing metrics and
service entries. For more information, see Metrics
configurations .
For examples of relabeling configs in the receiver, see
Additional receiver configuration .
Note: The minimum valid value for the scrape_interval field is 10 seconds. If you specify a value less than 10 seconds, then a value of 10 seconds is used instead.
Restart the Ops Agent
To apply your configuration changes, you must restart the Ops Agent.
LINUX
To restart the agent, run the following command on your instance:
sudo service google-cloud-ops-agent restart
To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and
verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started:
sudo systemctl status google-cloud-ops-agent"*"
Windows
Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges by right-clicking
the PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator .
To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command:
Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force
To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and
verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started:
Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent*
Prometheus metrics in Cloud Monitoring
You can use the tools provided by Cloud Monitoring with the data
collected by the Prometheus receiver. For example, you can chart data by using
Metrics Explorer , as described in
Google Cloud console for Monitoring .
The following sections describe the query tools available in
Cloud Monitoring with Metrics Explorer:
PromQL
Monitoring filters
You can create Cloud Monitoring dashboards and alerting policies
for your metrics. For information about dashboards and the
types of charts you can use, see Dashboards and charts .
For information about alerting policies, see Using alerting
policies .
You can also view your metrics in other interfaces, like the Prometheus
UI and Grafana. For information about setting up these interfaces, see the
following sections in the Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus documentation:
Prometheus UI
Grafana
Use PromQL
PromQL is the recommended query language for metrics ingested by using the
Prometheus receiver.
The simplest way to verify that your Prometheus data is being ingested
is to use the Cloud Monitoring Metrics Explorer page
in the Google Cloud console:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
leaderboard Metrics explorer page:
Go to Metrics explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
In the toolbar of the
query-builder pane, select the button whose name is either
code MQL or code PromQL .
Verify that PromQL is selected
in the Language toggle. The language toggle is in the same toolbar that
lets you format your query.
Enter the following query into the editor,
and then click Run query :
up
If your data is being ingested, then you see a chart like the following:
If you are running the JSON Exporter example ,
then you can also issue queries like the following:
Query all data for a specific exported metric by name, for example:
example_value_count
The following shows a chart for the example_value_count , including
labels defined by the JSON Exporter application and labels added by
the Ops Agent:
Query data for an exported metric that originated in a specific
namespace. The value of the namespace label is the Compute Engine
instance ID, a long number like 5671897148133813325 , assigned to the
VM. A query looks like the following:
example_value_count{namespace=" INSTANCE_ID "}
Query data that matches a specific regular expression. The JSON
Exporter emits metrics with an id label that has values like id-A ,
id-B , id-C . To filter for any metrics with an id label matching
this pattern, use the following query:
example_value_count{id=~"id.*"}
For more information about using PromQL in Metrics Explorer and
Cloud Monitoring charts,
see PromQL in Cloud Monitoring .
View metric usage and diagnostics in Cloud Monitoring
The Cloud Monitoring Metrics Management page provides information
that can help you control the amount you spend on billable metrics
without affecting observability. The Metrics Management page reports the
following information:
Ingestion volumes for both byte- and sample-based billing, across metric
domains and for individual metrics.
Data about labels and cardinality of metrics.
Number of reads for each metric.
Use of metrics in alerting policies and custom dashboards.
Rate of metric-write errors.
You can also use the Metrics Management page to
exclude unneeded metrics ,
eliminating the cost of ingesting them.
To view the Metrics Management page, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
query_stats Metrics management page:
Go to Metrics management
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
In the toolbar, select your time window. By default, the
Metrics Management page displays information about the metrics collected
in the previous one day.
For more information about the Metrics Management page, see
View and manage metric usage .
The prometheus_target resource
In Cloud Monitoring, time-series data is written against a monitored-resource
type. For Prometheus metrics, the monitored-resource type is
prometheus_target . Monitoring queries for
Prometheus metrics that are not written in PromQL
must specify this resource type.
The prometheus_target resource has the following labels, which you can
use for filtering and manipulating queried data:
project_id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project ,
in which the Ops Agent
is running.
location : The Google Cloud region or zone in which
the Ops Agent is running; for example, us-east1-a .
cluster : Always __gce__ for Prometheus metrics collected by using the
Ops Agent.
namespace : The Compute Engine instance ID of the VM on which the
Ops Agent is running.
job : The value of the job_name field in the receiver configuration.
instance : The instance label of the Prometheus target, taken from the
receiver configuration; defaults to the target.
The values for these labels are set during collection. The values of
the namespace , location , and cluster labels are immutable. If
the metrics scraped from your application also have these labels, the
Ops Agent prefixes the scraped labels with the string exported_ .
Relabeling: Modifying the data being scraped
You can use relabeling to modify the label set of the scrape target
or its metrics before the target is scraped. If you have multiple
steps in a relabeling config, they are applied in the order in which they
appear in the configuration file.
The Ops Agent creates a set of meta labels (labels prefixed with the
string __meta_ . These meta labels record information about the
Compute Engine instance on which the Ops Agent
is running. Labels prefixed with the __ string, including the meta labels,
are available only during relabeling. You can use relabeling to capture the
values of these labels in labels that are scraped.
Metric relabeling is applied to samples; it is the last step before
ingestion. You can use metric relabeling to drop time series
that you don't need to ingest; dropping these time series reduces
the number of samples ingested, which can lower costs.
For more information about relabeling, see the Prometheus documentation
for relabel_config and
metric_relabel_configs .
Compute Engine meta labels available during relabeling
When the Ops Agent scrapes metrics, it includes a set of meta labels whose
values are based on the configuration of the Compute Engine VM on which
the agent is running. You can use these labels and the Prometheus receiver's
relabel_configs section to add additional metadata to your metrics about
the VM from which they were ingested. For an example, see
Additional receiver configuration .
The following meta labels are available on targets for you to use in the
relabel_configs section:
__meta_gce_instance_id : the numeric ID of the Compute Engine
instance (local)
__meta_gce_instance_name : the name of the Compute Engine instance (local);
the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the
mutable instance_name label on your metrics.
__meta_gce_machine_type : full or partial URL of the machine type of the
instance; the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the
mutable machine_type label on your metrics.
__meta_gce_metadata_ NAME : each metadata item of the instance
__meta_gce_network : the network URL of the instance
__meta_gce_private_ip : the private IP address of the instance
__meta_gce_interface_ipv4_ NAME : IPv4 address of each named interface
__meta_gce_project : the Google Cloud project in which the instance is running (local)
__meta_gce_public_ip : the public IP address of the instance, if present
__meta_gce_tags : comma separated list of instance tags
__meta_gce_zone : the Compute Engine zone URL in which the instance is running
The values of these labels are set when the Ops Agent starts. If you modify
the values, then you have to restart the Ops Agent to refresh the values.
Additional receiver configuration
This section provides examples that use the relabel_configs and
metric_relabel_configs sections of the Prometheus receiver to modify
the number and structure of the metrics ingested. This section also includes
a modified version of the receiver for the JSON Exporter example that uses
the relabeling options.
Add VM metadata
You can use the relabel_configs section to add labels to metrics.
For example, the following uses a meta label, __meta_gce_zone ,
provided by the Ops Agent to create a metric label, zone , that
is preserved after relabeling, because zone does not have
the __ prefix.
For a list of available meta labels, see Compute Engine meta labels
available during relabeling . Some of the
meta labels are relabelled for you by the default Ops Agent configuration.
relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [__meta_gce_zone]
regex: '(.+)'
replacement: '${1}'
target_label: zone
The Prometheus receiver shown in Example: Configure the Ops Agent for
Prometheus includes the addition of this label.
Drop metrics
You can use the metrics_relabel_configs section to drop metrics that
you do not want to ingest; this pattern is useful for cost containment.
For example, you can use the following pattern to drop any metric with
a namesthat matches METRIC_NAME_REGEX_1 or METRIC_NAME_REGEX_2 :
metric_relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [ __name__ ]
regex: ' METRIC_NAME_REGEX_1 '
action: drop
- source_labels: [ __name__ ]
regex: ' METRIC_NAME_REGEX_2 '
action: drop
Add static labels
You can use the metrics_relabel_configs section to add static labels to
all metrics ingested by the Prometheus receiver. You can use the following
pattern to add labels staticLabel1 and staticLabel2 to all ingested metrics:
metric_relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [ __address__ ]
action: replace
replacement: ' STATIC_VALUE_1 '
target_label: staticLabel1
- source_labels: [ __address__ ]
action: replace
replacement: ' STATIC_VALUE_2 '
target_label: staticLabel2
The following version of the Prometheus receiver for the JSON Exporter
example uses these configuration patterns to do the following:
Set the zone label from the value of the __meta_gce_zone
meta label provided by the Ops Agent.
Drop the exporter's example_global_value metric.
Add the staticLabel label with the value "A static value" to all ingested
metrics.
