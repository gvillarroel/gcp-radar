launch stage descriptions .
Agent policies enable automated installation and maintenance of the
Google Cloud Observability agents
across a fleet of Compute Engine VMs that match
user-specified criteria. You can create a policy for a
Google Cloud project that governs existing and new VMs associated with that
Google Cloud project, ensuring proper
installation, uninstallation, and optional
auto-upgrade of all Google Cloud Observability agents
on those VMs.
You create and manage agent policies by using the
gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies command
group in the Google Cloud CLI or the
agent-policy Terraform module .
Agent policies use the
VM Manager suite of tools in
Compute Engine to manage OS policies ,
which can automate the deployment and maintenance of software configurations
like the
Google Cloud Observability agents: the Ops Agent, the legacy Monitoring agent, and the legacy Logging agent.
Supported operating systems
You can apply an agent policy to Compute Engine
VM instances running the operating systems shown in the following table:

In beta agent policies, the agent columns map to an
agent type specified to the
gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create invocation:
Ops Agent maps to agent type ops-agent .
Logging agent maps to agent type logging .
Monitoring agent maps to agent type metrics .
‡ The Monitoring agent is not
supported on rhel-7-9-sap-ha , rhel-8-2-sap-ha , or
rhel-8-4-sap-ha .
Create an agent policy
This section describes using the Google Cloud SDK for managing agent policies.
For information about using Terraform, see Terraform integration .
To create an agent policy by using the Google Cloud CLI, complete the following
steps:
If you haven't done so already, install the
Google Cloud CLI .
The agent policies described in this document use the beta command group.
If you haven't done so already, install the beta component of the
gcloud CLI:
gcloud components install beta
To check if you have the beta component for the installed, run:
gcloud components list
If you previously installed the beta component, ensure you have the
latest version:
gcloud components update
Download and use the following script to enable the APIs and to set the
proper permissions for using the Google Cloud CLI:
set-permissions.sh .
For information about the script, refer to The set-permissions.sh
script .
Note: The set-permissions.sh script is designed to run on Linux. If you're
using a machine on a different operating system, then run the script from
Cloud Shell .
Use the gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create command
to create a policy. For the syntax of the command, see the
gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create
documentation.
For examples showing how to format the command, see the
Examples
section in the Google Cloud CLI documentation.
For more information about the other commands in the command group and
the available options, see the
gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies documentation.
Best practices for using agent policies
To control the impact to production systems during rollout, we recommend that
you use instance labels and zones to filter the instances that the policy
applies to.
Here is an example of a phased rollout plan for Debian 11 VMs in a project
called my_project :
Phase 1: Create a policy named ops-agents-policy-safe-rollout to install the
legacy Logging agent and Monitoring agent on all VMs with the labels env=test and app=myproduct .
gcloud beta compute instances \
ops - agents policies create ops - agents - policy - safe - rollout \
-- agent - rules = "type=logging,version=current-major,package-state=installed,enable-autoupgrade=true;type=metrics,version=current-major,package-state=installed,enable-autoupgrade=true" \
-- os - types = short - name = debian , version = 11 \
-- group - labels = env = test , app = myproduct \
-- project = my_project
For more information about specifying the operating system, see
gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create .
Phase 2: Update that policy to target VMs in a single zone that have the
labels env=prod and app=myproduct .
gcloud beta compute instances \
ops-agents policies update ops-agents-policy-safe-rollout \
--group-labels=env=prod,app=myproduct \
--zones=us-central1-c \
Phase 3: Update that policy to clear the zones filter so it rolls out globally
gcloud beta compute instances \
ops-agents policies update ops-agents-policy-safe-rollout \
--clear-zones
Policies on VMs that predate OS Config
You might need to manually install and configure the OS Config agent on
VMs that predate OS Config. For information about manually installing
and verifying the OS Config agent, see the
VM Manager verification checklist .
Troubleshoot beta agent policies
This section provides information to help you resolve problems with beta agent
policies for the Ops Agent, the legacy Monitoring agent, and the legacy Logging agent.
The ops-agents policy commands fail
When a gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies command fails, the response shows a
validation error. Correct the errors by fixing the command arguments and
flags as suggested by the error message.
In addition to the validation errors, you might see errors that indicate the
following conditions:
Insufficient IAM permission
The OS Config API isn't enabled
The specified policy doesn't exist
The following sections describe these conditions in more detail.
Insufficient IAM permission
If a gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies command fails with a permission error, then
make sure you have run the set-permissions.sh script as described in
Create an agent policy
to set up the OS Config policy roles:
GuestPolicy Admin ( roles/osconfig.guestPolicyAdmin ) :
Provides full access to guest policies.
GuestPolicy Editor ( roles/osconfig.guestPolicyEditor ) :
Allows users to get, update, and list guest policies.
GuestPolicy Viewer ( roles/osconfig.guestPolicyViewer ) :
Provides read-only access to get and list guest policies.
For more information about the set-permissions.sh script, see
The set-permissions.sh script .
OS Config API isn't enabled
A sample error looks like the following:
API [osconfig.googleapis.com] not enabled on project PROJECT_ID .
Would you like to enable and retry (this will take a few minutes)?
(y/N)?
You can enter y to enable the API, or you can run the set-permissions.sh
script, described in
Create an agent policy ,
to grant all the necessary permissions. If you enter y at the
prompt in the error message, then you still need to run the
set-permissions.sh script to set the needed permissions.
To verify that the OS Config API is enabled for the project, run the
following commands:
gcloud services list --project PROJECT_ID | grep osconfig.googleapis.com
The expected output follows:
osconfig.googleapis.com Cloud OS Config API
The policy already exists
A sample error looks like the following:
ALREADY_EXISTS: Requested entity already exists
This error means this policy already exists with the same name, project ID and
region. You can use the gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies describe command to confirm this.
The policy does not exist
A sample error looks like the following:
NOT_FOUND: Requested entity was not found
This error might meant that the policy was never created, the policy has been
deleted, or that the specified policy ID is incorrect. Make sure the
POLICY_ID used in a gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies describe , update or
delete command corresponds to an existing policy. To get a list of agent
policies, use the gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies list command.
The policy is created, but seems to have no effect
OS Config agents are deployed to each Compute Engine instance to manage the
packages for the Logging and Monitoring agents.
The policy may seem to have no effect if the underlying OS Config agent isn't
installed.
Linux
To verify that the OS Config agent is installed, run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh instance-id \
--project project-id \
-- sudo systemctl status google-osconfig-agent
A sample output is:
google-osconfig-agent.service - Google OSConfig Agent
Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/google-osconfig-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset:
Active: active (running) since Wed 2020-01-15 00:14:22 UTC; 6min ago
Main PID: 369 (google_osconfig)
Tasks: 8 (limit: 4374)
Memory: 102.7M
CGroup: /system.slice/google-osconfig-agent.service
└─369 /usr/bin/google_osconfig_agent
Windows
To verify that the OS Config agent is installed, run the following steps:
Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open a PowerShell terminal, then run the following PowerShell command. You
don't need administrator privileges.
Get-Service google_osconfig_agent
A sample output is:
Status Name DisplayName
------ ---- -----------
Running google_osconfig_a… Google OSConfig Agent
If the OS Config agent is not installed, then you might be using an
operating system that doesn't support VM Manager. The
Compute Engine Operating system details document
indicates which VM Manager features are supported for each
Compute Engine operating system.
If the operating system supports VM Manager, then you
can install the OS Config agent manually.
The OS Config agent is installed, but it does not install the Monitoring agent
To verify if there are any errors when the OS Config agent applies policies, you
can check the OS Config agent's log. This can be done either by using
Logs Explorer or using SSH or RDP to check individual Compute Engine
instances.
To view OS Config agent logs in
Logs Explorer ,
use the following filter:
resource . type = "gce_instance"
logId ( OSConfigAgent )
To view OS Config agent logs, do the following:
CentOS, RHEL, SLES, SUSE
Run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE_ID \
--project PROJECT_ID \
-- sudo cat /var/log/messages \
| grep "OSConfigAgent\|google-fluentd\|stackdriver-agent"
Debian, Ubuntu
Run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE_ID \
--project PROJECT_ID \
-- sudo cat /var/log/syslog \
| grep "OSConfigAgent\|google-fluentd\|stackdriver-agent"
Windows
Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
Open the Event Viewer app, then select
Windows Logs > Application , and search
for logs with Source equal to OSConfigAgent .
If there is an error connecting to the OS Config service, make sure you run the
set-permissions.sh script as described in
Create an agent policy
to set up the OS Config metadata.
To verify that the OS Config metadata is enabled, you can run the following
command:
gcloud compute project-info describe \
--project PROJECT_ID \
| grep "enable-osconfig\|enable-guest-attributes" -A 1
The expected output follows:
- key: enable-guest-attributes
value: 'TRUE'
- key: enable-osconfig
value: 'TRUE'
Observability agents are installed, but not functioning properly
For information about debugging specific agents, see the following documents:
Troubleshoot the Ops Agent
Troubleshoot the legacy Logging agent
Troubleshoot the legacy Monitoring agent
Enable debug-level logs for the OS Config agent
It can be useful to enable debug-level logging in the OS Config agent when
reporting an issue.
You can set the osconfig-log-level: debug metadata to enable debug-level
logging for the OS Config agent. The collected logs have more information to
help with the investigation.
To enable debug-level logging for the entire project, run the following command:
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata \
--project PROJECT_ID \
--metadata osconfig-log-level=debug
To enable debug-level logging for one VM, run the following command:
gcloud compute instances add-metadata INSTANCE_ID \
--project PROJECT_ID \
--metadata osconfig-log-level=debug
Helper scripts
This section provides additional information about the helper scripts
described in this document:
The set-permissions.sh script
The diagnose.sh script
The set-permissions.sh script
After you download the set-permissions.sh script, you
can use the script to perform the following actions, based on the arguments
you provide:
Enable the Cloud Logging API, the Cloud Monitoring API, and the
OS Config API for the project.
Grant the Identity and Access Management roles Logs Writer
( roles/logging.logWriter ) and
Monitoring Metric Writer
( roles/monitoring.metricWriter )
to the Compute Engine default service
account
so that the agents can write logs and metrics to the
Logging and Cloud Monitoring APIs.
Enable the OS Config metadata for the project so that the OS Config agent
on each VM is active.
Grant one of the following IAM roles to the non-owner users
user or service account needed to create and manage policies. Project
owners have full access to create and manage policies; all other users
or service accounts must be granted one of the following roles:
GuestPolicy Admin ( roles/osconfig.guestPolicyAdmin ) :
Provides full access to guest policies.
GuestPolicy Editor ( roles/osconfig.guestPolicyEditor ) :
Allows users to get, update, and list guest policies.
GuestPolicy Viewer ( roles/osconfig.guestPolicyViewer ) :
Provides read-only access to get and list guest policies.
When running the script, you only need to specify the guestPolicy*
part of the role name. The script supplies the roles/osconfig.
part of the name.
The following examples show some common invocations for the script.
For more information, see the comments in the script itself.
To enable the APIs, grant the necessary roles to the default service account,
and enable the OS Config metadata for a project, run the script as follows:
bash set-permissions.sh --project= PROJECT_ID
To additionally grant one of the OS Config roles to a user who does
not have the Owner ( roles/owner ) role on the project, run the script as
follows:
bash set-permissions.sh --project= PROJECT_ID \
--iam-user= USER_EMAIL \
--iam-permission-role=guestPolicy [Admin|Editor|Viewer]
To additionally grant one of the OS Config roles to a non-default
service account, run the script as follows:
bash set-permissions.sh --project= PROJECT_ID \
--iam-service-account= SERVICE_ACCT_EMAIL \
--iam-permission-role=guestPolicy [Admin|Editor|Viewer]
The diagnose.sh script
Given a project ID, a Compute Engine instance ID,
and the agent policy ID, the
diagnose.sh script automatically collects
the necessary information to help diagnose issues with the policy:
The OS Config agent version
The underlying OS Config guest policy
The policies that are applicable to this Compute Engine instance
The agent package repositories that are pulled on to this
Compute Engine instance
To invoke the script, run the following command:
bash diagnose.sh --project-id= PROJECT_ID \
--gce-instance-id= INSTANCE_ID \
--policy-id= POLICY_ID
Terraform integration
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform
configuration, see Basic Terraform
commands . For information about how Terraform works, see
Using Terraform .
Terraform support for agent policies is built on top of the Google Cloud CLI
commands. To create an agent policy by using Terraform, follow the Terraform
module agent-policy instructions .
You can also find example policies in the
examples directory .
