Troubleshoot the Monitoring agent
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page helps you diagnose problems in the installation or running of the
Monitoring agent.
Note: If you see the following
message on a Linux virtual machine (VM), then you can safely ignore it:
Need to set
STACKDRIVER_API_KEY in /etc/sysconfig/stackdriver Not starting. Configuration
error.
This message is emitted by a legacy service that is gradually being
replaced. This message is benign and will eventually
disappear.
Checklist
If you are having trouble installing or using the Monitoring agent,
here are some things to check:
If Linux installation commands result in errors, then make sure that you
prefix the installation commands with sudo .
Verify that the agent service is running on your VM instance:
For a Windows VM, use the following PowerShell command:
Get-Service -Name StackdriverMonitoring
Search for a service called Stackdriver Monitoring . If the agent
isn't running, you might need to restart it.
For a Linux VM, use the following command:
sudo service stackdriver-agent status
If the agent isn't running, you might need to restart it using the
following command:
sudo service stackdriver-agent restart
If the restart fails, and the log output shows "Disabled via metadata",
you are likely running an image from
Google Cloud Marketplace ,
where the Monitoring agent is disabled by default. This is
controlled by the google-monitoring-enable instance metadata key (with
the value 0 ). To re-enable the agent, either remove that key or set
the value to 1 (see
Setting instance metadata ).
If the agent isn't disabled via metadata, reinstall the agent. For
information about this process, see
Reinstalling the Monitoring agent .
See if the agent has written error messages to the logs.
On Windows, the Monitoring agent writes messages to the
Windows Event log.
On Linux, the Monitoring agent is a collectd package
and logs messages to /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages . The log
messages are prefixed by collectd or stackdriver-agent :
If you see HTTP 429 errors, you might have exceeded your
Monitoring API quotas . You can see your
available quota by selecting APIs & services > Dashboard in the
Google Cloud console. Choose the Monitoring API.
If you see proxy problems, check that you correctly configured you
HTTP proxy. The instructions are part of
Installing on Linux and Windows .
If you see API access or authorization problems, or error messages
such as "Unable to determine collectd endpoint", see the following
section, Verifying project and credentials .
If you see "Unsupported collectd plugin/type combination" or
"Unsupported collectd id" errors in the logs, you might be sending
unsupported agent metrics. This can happen in the following
scenarios:
You modified one of the agent third-party application
configurations. To revert the changes, you can reinstall the
configuration for the specific plug-in by following the
instructions in the relevant documentation
page . If you want to use the agent
to send that metric to Monitoring, consider
converting them to
user-defined metrics .
One of the third-party application plugins is sending new
metrics that are unknown to Monitoring. See the
support page for details on
how to submit a request to get these metrics reviewed and
categorized .
If the agent seems to be running normally, but you aren't getting data or
your alerting policies aren't acting as you think they should, then you
should check that the agent is sending data to the correct project. See the
following section, Verifying project and credentials .
Verifying project and credentials
If the Monitoring agent is reporting access or authorization errors, or if the
agent seems to be running normally but there is no data or your alerting
policies aren't working as you expect, then check that your VM instance's
credentials are correct, including that they specify the correct project:
If you are using a Compute Engine VM instance with standard (not
private-key) credentials, then it is unlikely that data is going to the
wrong project, but your credentials might still be deficient. For
information about credentials,
see Authorize the Monitoring agent .
To verify your credentials, see
Verifying Compute Engine credentials .
If you are using private-key credentials on your Compute Engine instance,
then the credentials could be invalid or they could be from the wrong
project. For information about credentials, see
Authorize the Monitoring agent .
To verify your credentials, see
Verifying private-key credentials .
If you still haven't resolved your problem,
see Reinstalling the Monitoring agent .
Verifying Compute Engine credentials
Use the Compute Engine VM instances page of the Google Cloud console to
verify that your Compute Engine VM instance has adequate credential
for the Monitoring agent. The credentials are typically added in
the default service account of all new Compute Engine VM instances, but it is
possible to overwrite those defaults when creating an instance.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page:
Go to VM instances
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Compute Engine .
If necessary, change the current Google Cloud project to be the one associated
with your Compute Engine VM instance. For example, if you are
prompted to Enable billing , then it means the current project doesn't
have any Compute Engine VM instances in it.
In the VM Instances page, click the name of your VM instance. The detail
page for your VM instance appears.
In the VM instance details page, look under the Cloud API access
scopes heading:
If you see "Allow full access to all Cloud APIs," then you have adequate
credentials.
If you see, next to Stackdriver Monitoring API , an older name for
the Cloud Monitoring API, that you have Write
Only or Full permission, then you have adequate credentials.
Otherwise, your instance's default service account doesn't have the
credentials needed by the agent. To use the agent on your instance, you
must add private-key service account credentials. For instructions, see
Adding credentials .
If you have the correct default credentials, skip ahead to
Installing on Linux and Windows .
Verifying private-key credentials
To verify that valid private-key credentials are installed on your VM instance,
first verify that the credentials file exists in its expected location, and then
verify that the information in the credentials file is valid. Previously-valid
credentials can be revoked using the IAM & Admin > Service accounts section
of the Google Cloud console. If valid credentials aren't present, see
Adding credentials
to replace the existing credentials or to add new ones.
Caution: Other services besides Cloud Monitoring might use private-key
credentials on your instance. Replacing existing credentials might prevent
other services from working.
Are the credentials present?
To see if private-key service account credentials are on your instance, run the
following Linux commands on your instance:
sudo cat $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
sudo cat /etc/google/auth/application_default_credentials.json
If either command displays a file like the one shown below, then your instance
might have valid private-key credentials. If both commands display a file, then
the file denoted by GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is used.
{
"type" : "service_account" ,
"project_id" : "{your-project-id}" ,
"private_key_id" : "{your-private-key-id}" ,
"private_key" : "{your-private-key}" ,
"client_email" : "{your-project-number}-{your-key}@developer.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"client_id" : "{your-client-id}" ,
"auth_uri" : "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth" ,
"token_uri" : "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token" ,
"auth_provider_x509_cert_url" : "{x509-cert-url}" ,
"client_x509_cert_url" : "{client-x509-cert-url}"
}
If there are no credential files present, then see
Adding credentials .
Are the credentials valid?
In the credentials file, the project_id field is your Google Cloud project,
client_email identifies the service account in the project,
and private_key_id identifies
the private key in the service account. Match this information with what is
shown in the IAM & Admin > Service accounts section of the
Google Cloud console.
The credentials file isn't valid if any of the following are true:
You are checking a Compute Engine VM instance, but the
Google Cloud project in the
credentials file isn't the project that contains your instance.
The listed service account doesn't exist. It might have been deleted.
The listed service account doesn't have the right roles enabled. It should
have at least roles/monitoring.metricWriter (Monitoring Metric Writer)
for metric collection and roles/logging.logWriter (Logs Writer) for
writing logs.
The private key doesn't exist. It might have been revoked.
If the service account is all right but the private key has been revoked, then
you can create a new private key and copy it to your instance. Otherwise, you
must create a new service account as described in the following section,
Adding credentials .
Generating new credentials
If the credentials aren't valid, take the following steps:
For each connected project containing instances that need to be authorized
with a private key —
each project containing
Compute Engine instances that were
created without including the access scope
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write —
create a service account and generate
a private key, if they don't already exist. Follow the steps below:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
settings Settings page:
Go to Settings
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Select the Netric scope tab.
Identify the project containing the Compute Engine resources
in question and navigate to the
Google Cloud console .
Go to the IAM Service Accounts page of the
Google Cloud console, select your Google Cloud project, create a new
service account, and then generate a new private key for that
service account.
To perform these steps, do one of the following:
Go to the IAM Service Accounts page,
select your Google Cloud project, and then follow the steps in
Create a service account :
Go to IAM Service Accounts
Click the following button and then select your
Google Cloud project:
Create service account and download key
The previous button automates the process of creating
and downloading a key to your local system for the
agent-specific service account. If necessary, the
process also creates the required service account
and ensures that the service account has the correct
permissions. Agent-specific service accounts have a
name similar to
stackdriver-1234@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com .
You are notified of the completion of these
actions with a dialog similar to the following:
Note: Service accounts can have a
maximum of 10 keys. For more information, see
Limits .
Replace the private key on the instances that correspond to the
service account in question.
On Linux, replace the private key located in
/etc/google/auth/application_default_credentials.json .
On Windows, replace the private key located in
C:\ProgramData\Google\Auth\application_default_credentials.json .
For more information, see
Copying the private key to your instance .
Restart the agent
On Linux, run sudo service stackdriver-agent restart
On Windows, go into the service management console and restart the
Cloud Monitoring service.
If you have multiple projects that need new private keys, repeat this procedure
for each of them.
To verify that the private key is correct, see Are the credentials present? .
Specifically:
Read the private key JSON file on the instance, for example (on Linux):
sudo cat /etc/google/auth/application_default_credentials.json
Ensure that the value of the project_id field matches that of the
monitored project for which you just generated credentials.
Verifying the agent data
To verify that the agent is sending metrics correctly, use
the timeSeries.list method of the Monitoring API
to look for recent time
series data from the VM instance. You can call the method using the
APIs Explorer on
the method's documentation page. If you don't
see any data, it may be that the agent is sending data to the wrong project. To
check that, see Verifying project and credentials .
Here are detailed instructions for using the
timeSeries.list method:
Determine the instance ID of the VM instance where you installed the agent:
Compute Engine instances: Go to the Compute Engine detail page
for your instance. At the bottom of the page, click Equivalent REST .
The ID is a 19-digit number.
Go to the documentation page for the
timeSeries.list method.
Fill out the APIs Explorer form:
Set name to the project containing your VM instance, prefixed by
projects/ . For example, projects/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID] .
Set filter to the following line to choose an agent metric from
your VM instance. Copy and paste it into the APIs Explorer,
and then change the VM instance ID:
metric . type = "agent.googleapis.com/memory/bytes_used" AND resource . label . instance_id = "[YOUR-VM-INSTANCE-ID]"
Set the search time interval. You want approximately a five-minute
interval:
Set interval.endTime to the current GMT time, which you can find
at time.is/GMT . The time
must be formatted like the following example. Don't enclose the
time in quotation marks:
2016 - 10 - 31 T14 : 10 : 00 Z
Set interval.startTime to approximately five minutes
before the end time, using the same format.
Leave all the other fields blank.
Click Execute .
You should see output like the following:
{
"timeSeries" : [
{
"metric": {
"labels": {
"state": "buffered"
},
"type": "agent.googleapis.com/memory/bytes_used"
},
"resource": {
"type": "[INSTANCE-TYPE ] ",
" labels ": {
" instance_id ": " [ YOUR-VM-INSTANCE-ID ] ",
" zone ": " [ YOUR-INSTANCE-ZONE ] ",
" project_id ": " [ YOUR-PROJECT-ID ] "
}
},
" metricKind ": " GAUGE ",
" valueType ": " DOUBLE ",
" points ": [
{
" interval ": {
" startTime ": " [ START_TIME ] ",
" endTime ": " [ END_TIME ] "
},
" value ": {
" doubleValue ": 27451392
}
} ,
...
If the API call returns any time series data from your VM instance,
as shown above, then your agent is working properly and you are finished.
If you don't see any time series data, check the following:
If your API call results in an error message, this doesn't indicate an
agent problem. Check that the APIs Explorer fields are filled
properly:
"Invalid argument" errors probably indicate a problem with the spelling
and format of the project ID, filter, or the two timestamps.
The requirements for the time-stamp arguments depend on the metric
type you specify. A metric type records GAUGE , DELTA , or
CUMULATIVE data. See MetricKind for more
information.
For DELTA and CUMULATIVE metrics, both the start and end times are
required, and the end time must be later than the start time. These kinds
of metric types record changes measured over time, so the start and
end times must define a non-zero interval.
"Not authorized" errors can mean you misspelled the project ID.
"Not found" errors can indicate that you've omitted the required
projects/ prefix in the "name" field.
Fix the problems and try the API call again.
If the API call succeeds but you see only an empty response, { } , then
check that your filter and time interval are correct. Errors in formatting
the timestamps can result in no data being returned. If everything seems
correct but you are getting no data, then the agent isn't sending metric
data, or at least not to the project you are expecting it to. This might
indicate a credentials problem;
see Verifying private-key credentials .
Reinstalling the Monitoring agent
Installing the most recent version of the agent can solve many problems:
If you are sure that the problem isn't related to credentials, you can skip
ahead to Installing on Linux and Windows .
For a full install of the agent and any needed credentials,
see Install the Monitoring agent .
Determining which Linux VMs have the agent installed
Run either of the following queries to see which Linux VMs are running the
agent:
APIs Explorer
Metrics Explorer
Note that for each query, you must enter your project name and adjust the
time bounds.
Automatically restarting the agent
You can set up a script to check if the agent is running and then restart the
agent in the event that it crashed.
For example, on Linux, you can create the following crontab entry to check the
agent status every 5 minutes:
*/5 * * * * /bin/pidof stackdriver-collectd >/dev/null 2>&1 || /usr/sbin/service stackdriver-agent restart >/dev/null 2>&1
Known issues
The following sections describe issues known to the Monitoring agent.
Process data access issue (Windows)
You might see an agent error message in the Windows Event Log similar to the
following:
Read access denied for processes: Registry (84), smss.exe (264), csrss.exe (376), wininit.exe (448), csrss.exe (456), services.exe (580), NisSrv.exe (3008), MsMpEng.exe (3624), csrss.exe (7044)
This message indicates that the agent doesn't have access to this data on your
system. To stop seeing this message, you can provide sufficient permissions to
the SYSTEM user to read process data for the processes and services listed
in the error messages. If you don't need this data, then you can safely ignore
these informational messages.
Metadata cache issues (Linux)
You might see an error message in the Linux system log file ( /var/log/syslog
on Debian / Ubuntu or /var/log/messages on Red Hat / CentOS / SLES) similar
to the following:
collectd [ 25571 ] : uc_update : Value too old : name = myhost / processes-all / ps_vm ;
value time = 1511345468 . 180 ; last cache update = 1511345468 . 180 ;
write_gcm : wg_update_stats failed .
write_gcm : uc_update returned an error .
These messages are harmless warnings and aren't an indication of data loss.
These messages are generated by the current processes plugin implementation
when there is a timestamp mismatch.
Infinite value data point dropped issue (Linux)
You might see an error message in the Linux system log file ( /var/log/syslog
on Debian / Ubuntu or /var/log/messages on Red Hat / CentOS / SLES) similar
to the following:
write_gcm: can not take infinite value
This message indicates that a single malformed data point is dropped. This is
normally harmless and can be ignored.
Metadata key throttle issue (Linux)
You might see an error message in the Linux system log file ( /var/log/syslog
on Debian / Ubuntu or /var/log/messages on Red Hat / CentOS / SLES) similar
to the following:
collectd[7440]:match_throttle_metadata_keys: uc_meta_data_add returned an error
collectd[7440]:match_throttle_metadata_keys: mtg_update_stats failed
This message indicates that the status update of memory throttling fails once.
It is normally harmless, but could be a sign that the agent is running out of
memory, especially if it occurs frequently.
Out of Cloud Monitoring API quota issue (Linux)
You might see an error message in the Linux system log file ( /var/log/syslog
on Debian / Ubuntu or /var/log/messages on Red Hat / CentOS / SLES) similar
to the following:
collectd[25198]: write_gcm: Unsuccessful HTTP request 429
This message indicates the Cloud Monitoring API quota limit was reached.
Follow the
Quota
guide for information on managing your quota limit.
High memory usage due to low COLLECTD_INTERVAL (Linux)
You might see high memory usage of the agent when the COLLECTD_INTERVAL is
configured to be shorter than the default 60 seconds , for example, 10
seconds instead. This is a known limitation of the agent because it sends
requests serially from a single thread. To mitigate this, consider reducing
the COLLECTD_INTERVAL only for a subset of required metrics, and leave the
rest of the metrics at the default interval.
Token buffer overflow issue (Linux)
You might see an error message in the Linux system log file (/var/log/syslog on Debian / Ubuntu or /var/log/messages on Red Hat / CentOS / SLES) similar to the following:
write_gcm: Error or buffer overflow when building auth_header
write_gcm: wg_oauth2_get_auth_header failed.
write_gcm: wg_transmit_unique_segment failed.
write_gcm: wg_transmit_unique_segments failed. Flushing.
These messages indicate that the monitoring agent needs to be upgraded to version 6.1.2 or higher.
Repository changed its 'Origin' value (Linux)
You might see an error message similar to the following when upgrading the
agent, installing the agent, or running apt-get update on Debian/Ubuntu
Linux:
E : Repository ' https : //packages.cloud.google.com/apt google-cloud-monitoring-buster-all InRelease' changed its 'Origin' value from 'google-cloud-monitoring-buster' to 'namespaces/cloud-ops-agents-artifacts/repositories/google-cloud-monitoring-buster-all'
E : Repository ' https : //packages.cloud.google.com/apt google-cloud-monitoring-buster-all InRelease' changed its 'Label' value from 'google-cloud-monitoring-buster' to 'namespaces/cloud-ops-agents-artifacts/repositories/google-cloud-monitoring-buster-all'
This message indicates that the package repository cache may have diverged
from its source. To resolve this, run the following command:
apt-get --allow-releaseinfo-change update
Then, run the upgrade or install again.
Removed agent reported by Google Cloud console as installed
After you uninstall the agent, the Google Cloud console might take up to one
hour to report this change.
Monitoring agent doesn't appear in Windows Uninstall a program list
To uninstall the Monitoring agent when it isn't listed in the Windows Control
Panel's Uninstall a program list, run uninstall.exe from the directory
where you installed it.
