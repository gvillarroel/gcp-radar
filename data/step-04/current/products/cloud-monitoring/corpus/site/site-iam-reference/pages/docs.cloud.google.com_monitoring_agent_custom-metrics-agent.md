Beta
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This guide explains how you can configure the Monitoring agent to
recognize and export your application metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
The Monitoring agent is a collectd daemon. In addition to
exporting many predefined system and third-party metrics to
Cloud Monitoring, the
agent can export your own collectd application metrics to
Monitoring
as user-defined metrics . Your collectd plugins can also
export to Monitoring.
An alternative way to export application metrics to Monitoring
is to
use StatsD . Cloud Monitoring provides a default configuration that maps
StatsD metrics to user-defined metrics. If you are satisfied with that mapping,
then you don't need the customization steps described below.
For more information, see the StatsD plugin .
For more information about metrics, see the following documents:
Metrics, time series, and resources .
Structure of time series .
User-defined metrics overview .
This functionality is only available for agents running on Linux. It is
not available on Windows.
Before you begin
Install the most recent Monitoring agent on a VM instance and
verify it is working. To update your agent, see Updating the
agent .
Configure collectd to get monitoring data from your application.
Collectd supports many application frameworks and standard monitoring
endpoints through its read plugins . Find a read plugin that
works for you.
(Optional) As a convenience, add the agent's collectd reference
documentation to your system's man pages by updating the MANPATH
variable and then running mandb :
export MANPATH = "$MANPATH:/opt/stackdriver/collectd/share/man"
sudo mandb
The man pages are for stackdriver-collectd .
Important files and directories
The following files and directories, created by installing the agent, are
relevant to using the Monitoring agent (collectd):
/etc/stackdriver/collectd.conf
The collectd configuration file used by the agent. Edit this file to
change general configuration.
Note: The system-default collectd configuration, /etc/collectd.conf ,
isn't used by the Monitoring agent.
/etc/stackdriver/collectd.d/
The directory for user-added configuration files. To send user-defined
metrics from the agent, you place the required configuration files, discussed
below, in this directory. For backward compatibility, the agent also looks for
files in /opt/stackdriver/collectd/etc/collectd.d/ .
/opt/stackdriver/collectd/share/man/*
The documentation for the agent's version of collectd. You can add
these pages to your system's set of man pages; see Before you begin
for details.
/etc/init.d/stackdriver-agent
The init script for the agent.
How Monitoring handles collectd metrics
As background, the Monitoring agent processes collectd metrics
and sends them to Monitoring, which treats each metric as a
member of one of the following categories:
User-defined metrics . Collectd metrics that have the metadata key
stackdriver_metric_type and a single
data source are handled
as user-defined metrics and sent to
Monitoring using the
projects.timeSeries.create method
in the Monitoring API.
Curated metrics . All other collectd metrics are sent to
Monitoring using an internal API. Only the metrics
in the list of curated metrics are
accepted and processed.
Discarded metrics . Collectd metrics that aren't in the curated metrics
list and aren't user-defined metrics are silently discarded by
Monitoring. The agent itself isn't aware of which metrics
are accepted or discarded.
Write user-defined metrics with the agent
You configure the agent to send metric data points to
Monitoring. Each point must be associated with a
user-defined metric, which you define with a metric descriptor .
These concepts are introduced in Metrics, time series, and resources
and described in detail at Structure of time series and
User-defined metrics overview .
You can have a collectd metric treated as a user-defined metric by
adding the proper metadata to the metric:
stackdriver_metric_type : (required) the name of the exported metric.
Example: custom.googleapis.com/my_custom_metric .
label:[LABEL] : (optional) additional labels for the exported
metric. For example, if you want a Monitoring STRING label
named color , then your metadata key would be label:color and the value
of the key could be "blue" . You can have up to 10 labels per metric type.
You can use a collectd filter chain to modify the metadata for
your metrics. Because filter chains can't modify the list of data sources and
user-defined metrics only support a single data source, any collectd metrics
that you want to use with this facility must have a single data source.
Example
In this example we will monitor active Nginx connections from two Nginx
services, my_service_a and my_service_b . We will send these to
Monitoring using a user-defined metric.
We will take the following steps:
Identify the collectd metrics for each Nginx service.
Define a Monitoring metric descriptor.
Configure a collectd filter chain to add metadata to the
collectd metrics, to meet the expectations of the Monitoring
agent.
Incoming collectd metrics
Collectd expects metrics to consist of the following components. The first five
components make up the collectd identifier for the metric:
Host, Plugin, Plugin-instance, Type, Type-instance, [value]
In this example, the metrics you want to send as a user-defined metric
have the following values:
Component
Expected value(s)
Host
any
Plugin
curl_json
Plugin instance
nginx_my_service_a or nginx_my_service_b 1
Type
gauge
Type instance
active-connections
[value]
any value 2
Notes :
1 In the example, this value encodes both the application (Nginx) and
the connected service name.
2 The value is typically a timestamp and double-precision number.
Monitoring handles the details of interpreting the various kinds
of values. Compound values aren't supported by the
Monitoring agent.
Monitoring metric descriptor and time series
On the Monitoring side, design a metric descriptor for your
user-defined metric. The following descriptor is a reasonable choice for the
data in this example:
Name: custom.googleapis.com/nginx/active_connections
Labels:
service_name (STRING): The name of the service connected to Nginx.
Kind: GAUGE
Type: DOUBLE
After you've designed the metric descriptor, you can create it by using
projects.metricDescriptors.create ,
or you can let it be created for you
from the time series metadata, discussed below. For more information,
see Creating metric descriptors on this page.
The time series data for this metric descriptor must contain the following
information, because of the way the metric descriptor is defined:
Metric type: custom.googleapis.com/nginx/active_connections
Metric label values:
service_name : either "my_service_a" or "my_service_b"
Other time series information, including the
associated monitored resource —the VM
instance sending the data—and the metric's data point, is automatically
obtained by the agent for all metrics. You don't have to do anything special.
Your filter chain
Note: You must hook your new filter chain into the PreCache filter chain.
Create a file, /opt/stackdriver/collectd/etc/collectd.d/nginx_curl_json.conf ,
containing the following code:
LoadPlugin match_regex
LoadPlugin target_set
LoadPlugin target_replace
# Insert a new rule in the default "PreCache" chain , to divert your metrics .
PreCacheChain "PreCache"
< Chain "PreCache" >
< Rule "jump_to_custom_metrics_from_curl_json" >
# If the plugin name and instance match , this is PROBABLY a metric we ' re looking for :
< Match regex >
Plugin "^curl_json$"
PluginInstance "^nginx_"
< / Match >
< Target "jump" >
# Go execute the following chain ; then come back .
Chain "PreCache_curl_json"
< / Target >
< / Rule >
# Continue processing metrics in the default "PreCache" chain .
< / Chain >
# Following is a NEW filter chain , just for your metric .
# It is only executed if the default chain "jumps" here .
< Chain "PreCache_curl_json" >
# The following rule does all the work for your metric :
< Rule "rewrite_curl_json_my_special_metric" >
# Do a careful match for just your metrics ; if it fails , drop down
# to the next rule :
< Match regex >
Plugin "^curl_json$" # Match on plugin .
PluginInstance "^nginx_my_service_.*$" # Match on plugin instance .
Type "^gauge$" # Match on type .
TypeInstance "^active-connections$" # Match on type instance .
< / Match >
< Target "set" >
# Specify the metric descriptor type :
MetaData "stackdriver_metric_type" "custom.googleapis.com/nginx/active_connections"
# Specify a value for the "service_name" label ; clean it up in the next Target :
MetaData "label:service_name" "%{plugin_instance}"
< / Target >
< Target "replace" >
# Remove the "nginx_" prefix in the service_name to get the real service name :
MetaData "label:service_name" "nginx_" ""
< / Target >
< / Rule >
# The following rule is run after rewriting your metric , or
# if the metric wasn ' t one of your user - defined metrics . The rule returns
# to the default "PreCache" chain . The default processing
# will write all metrics to Cloud Monitoring ,
# which will drop any unrecognized metrics : ones that aren ' t
# in the list of curated metrics and don ' t have
# the user - defined metric metadata .
< Rule "go_back" >
Target "return"
< / Rule >
< / Chain >
Load the new configuration
Restart your agent to pick up the new configuration by executing the following
command on your VM instance:
sudo service stackdriver-agent restart
Your user-defined metric information begins to flow into
Monitoring.
Reference and best practices
Metric descriptors and time series
For an introduction to Cloud Monitoring metrics, see
Metrics, time series, and resources .
More details are available in
User-defined metrics overview
and Structure of time series .
Metric descriptors . A metric descriptor has the following significant
pieces:
A type of the form
custom.googleapis.com/[NAME1]/.../[NAME0] . For example:
custom.googleapis.com/my_measurement
custom.googleapis.com/instance/network/received_packets_count
custom.googleapis.com/instance/network/sent_packets_count
The
recommended naming is hierarchical to make the metrics easier for people to
keep track of. Metric types can't contain hyphens; for the exact naming
rules, see Naming metric types and labels .
Up to 10 labels to annotate the metric data, such as
device_name , fault_type , or response_code . The values of the
labels aren't specified in the metric descriptor.
The kind and value type of the data points, such as "a gauge value of type
double". For more information, see
MetricKind and ValueType .
Time series . A metric data point has the following significant pieces:
The type of the associated metric descriptor.
Values for all of the metric descriptor's labels.
A timestamped value consistent with the metric descriptor's value type and
kind.
The monitored resource
the data came from, typically a VM instance. Space for the resource is built
in, so the descriptor doesn't need a separate label for it.
Creating metric descriptors
You don't have to create a metric descriptor ahead of time.
When a data point arrives in Monitoring, the point's
metric type, labels, and the point's value can be used to automatically
create a gauge or cumulative metric descriptor. For more information, see
Auto-creation of metric descriptors .
However, there are advantages to creating your own metric descriptor:
You can include some thoughtful documentation for the metric and its labels.
You can specify additional kinds and types of metrics. The only (kind,
type) combinations supported by the agent are (GAUGE, DOUBLE) and
(CUMULATIVE, INT64). For more information,
see Metric kinds and value types .
You can specify label types other than STRING.
If you write a data point to Monitoring that uses a metric type
that isn't defined, then a new metric descriptor is created for the data
point. This behavior can be a problem when you are debugging the code that
writes metric data—misspelling the metric type results in spurious metric
descriptors.
After you create a metric descriptor, or after it is created for you, it cannot
be changed. For example, you can't add or remove labels. You can only delete
the metric descriptor—which deletes all its data—and then recreate
the descriptor the way you want.
For more details about creating metric descriptors, see
Creating your metric .
Pricing
To learn about pricing for Cloud Monitoring, see the Google Cloud Observability pricing page.
Limits
Cloud Monitoring has limits on the number of metric time
series and the number of user-defined metric descriptors in each project.
For details, see Quotas and limits .
If you discover that you have created metric descriptors you no longer want, you
can find and delete the descriptors using the Monitoring API. For more
information, see projects.metricDescriptors .
Troubleshooting
This section explains how to configure the Monitoring agent's
write_log plugin to dump out the full set of metric points, including
metadata. This can be used to determine what points need to be transformed, as
well as to ensure your transformations behave as expected.
Note: This will produce a lot output in the system logs. We recommend turning
this feature off at the end of your troubleshooting session. If you have
configured the Cloud Logging agent, then you can view the system log
entries in Cloud Logging.
Enabling write_log
The write_log plugin is included in the stackdriver-agent package. To enable
the plugin:
As root , edit the following configuration file:
/etc/stackdriver/collectd.conf
Right after LoadPlugin write_gcm , add:
LoadPlugin write_log
Right after <Plugin "write_gcm">…</Plugin> , add:
<Plugin "write_log">
Format JSON
</Plugin>
Search for <Target "write">…</Target> and after every Plugin "write_gcm" ,
add:
Plugin "write_log"
Save your changes and restart the agent:
sudo service stackdriver-agent restart
These changes will print one log line per metric value reported, including the
full collectd identifier, the metadata entries, and the value.
Output of write_log
If you were successful in the previous step, you should see the output of
write_log in the system logs:
Debian-based Linux : /var/log/syslog
Red Hat-based Linux : /var/log/messages
