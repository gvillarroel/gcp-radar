Configure the Ops Agent
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides details about the Ops Agent's default and custom
configurations. Read this document if any of the following applies to you:
You want to change the configuration of the Ops Agent to achieve the
following goals:
Turn off the built-in logging or metrics ingestion.
To turn off logging ingestion, see Example logging service
configurations .
To turn off host-metrics ingestion, see Example metrics service
configurations .
Customize the file path of the log files that the agent collects logs
from; see Logging receivers .
Customize the structured log format that the agent uses to process
the log entries, by parsing the JSON or by using regular expressions;
see Logging processors .
Change the sampling rate for metrics; see Metrics
receivers .
Customize which group or groups of metrics to enable. The agent collects
all system metrics, like cpu and memory , by default; see
Metrics processors .
Customize how the agent rotates logs; see Log-rotation
configuration .
Collect metrics and logs from supported third-party applications.
See Monitor third-party applications
for the list of supported applications.
Use the Prometheus receiver
to collect custom metrics.
Use the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) receiver
to collect custom metrics and traces.
You're interested in learning the technical details of the Ops Agent's
configuration.
Configuration model
The Ops Agent uses a built-in default configuration; you can't directly
modify this built-in configuration. Instead, you create a file of overrides
that are merged with the built-in configuration when the agent restarts.
The building blocks of the configuration are as follows:
receivers : This element describes what is collected by the agent.
processors : This element describes how the agent can modify the collected
information.
service : This element links receivers and processors together to create
data flows, called pipelines . The service element contains a pipelines
element, which can contain multiple pipelines.
The built-in configuration is made up of these elements, and you use the
same elements to override that built-in configuration.
Note: The Ops Agent sends logs to Cloud Logging and metrics to
Cloud Monitoring. You can't configure the agent to export logs or metrics
to other services. You can, however, configure Cloud Logging
to export logs; for more information, see Route logs to supported
destinations .
Built-in configuration
The built-in configuration for the Ops Agent defines the default
collection for logs and metrics. The following shows the built-in
configuration for Linux and for Windows:
Linux
By default, the Ops Agent collects file-based syslog logs and host
metrics.
For more information about the metrics collected, see

Windows
By default, the Ops Agent collects Windows event logs from System ,
Application , and Security channels, as well as host metrics, IIS
metrics, and SQL Server metrics.
For more information about the metrics collected, see

processors : [ metrics_filter ]
These configurations are discussed in more detail in
Logging configuration and
Metrics configuration .
User-specified configuration
To override the built-in configuration, you add new configuration elements
to the user configuration file. Put your configuration for
the Ops Agent in the following files:
For Linux: /etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml
For Windows: C:\Program Files\Google\Cloud Operations\Ops Agent\config\config.yaml
Any user-specified configuration is merged with the built-in configuration
when the agent restarts.
Note: If you make any configuration changes, then you must restart the
agent to apply the updated
configurations.
To override a built-in receiver, processor, or pipeline, redefine it
in your config.yaml file by declaring it with the same identifier.
Starting with Ops Agent version 2.31.0,
you can also configure the agent's log-rotation feature; for more information,
see Configure log rotation in the
Ops Agent .
For example, the built-in configuration for metrics includes a hostmetrics
receiver that specifies a 60-second collection interval. To change the
collection interval for host metrics to 30 seconds, include a metrics receiver
called hostmetrics in your config.yaml file that sets the
collection_interval value to 30 seconds, as shown in the following example:
metrics :
receivers :
hostmetrics :
type : hostmetrics
collection_interval : 30s
For other examples of changing the built-in configurations, see
Logging configuration and
Metrics configuration .
You can also turn off the collection of logging or metric data. These
changes are described in the example logging service
configurations and metrics
service configurations .
You can use this file to prevent the agent from collecting self logs
and sending those logs to Cloud Logging. For more information, see
Collection of self logs .
You also configure the agent's log-rotation feature by using this file;
for more information, see Configure log rotation in the
Ops Agent .
You can't configure the Ops Agent to export logs
or metrics to services other than Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring.
Logging configurations
The logging configuration uses the configuration model
described previously:
receivers : This element describes the data to collect from log files;
this data is mapped into a <timestamp, record> model.
processors : This optional element describes how the agent can modify the
collected information.
service : This element links receivers and processors together to create
data flows, called pipelines . The service element contains a pipelines
element, which can include multiple pipeline definitions.
Each receiver and each processor can be used in multiple pipelines.
The following sections describe each of these elements.
The Ops Agent sends logs to Cloud Logging. You can't configure it to
export logs to other services. You can, however, configure Cloud Logging
to export logs; for more information, see Route logs to supported
destinations .
Logging receivers
The receivers element contains a set of receivers, each identified by
a RECEIVER_ID . A receiver describes how to retrieve the logs; for example,
by tailing files, by using a TCP port, or from the Windows Event Log.
Structure of logging receivers
Each receiver must have an identifier, RECEIVER_ID , and include a type
element. The valid types are:
files : Collect logs by tailing files on disk.
fluent_forward (Ops Agent versions 2.12.0 and later):
Collect logs sent via the Fluent Forward protocol over TCP.
tcp (Ops Agent versions 2.3.0 and later):
Collect logs in JSON format by listening to a TCP port.
Linux only:
syslog : Collect Syslog messages over TCP or UDP.
systemd_journald (Ops Agent versions 2.4.0 and later): Collect
systemd journal logs from the systemd-journald service.
Windows only:
windows_event_log : Collect Windows Event Logs using the Windows Event Log
API.
Third-party application log receivers
The receivers structure looks like the following:
receivers:
RECEIVER_ID :
type: files
...
RECEIVER_ID_2 :
type: syslog
...
Depending on the value of the type element, there might be other
configuration options, as follows:
files receivers:
include_paths : Required. A list of filesystem paths to read by
tailing each file. The following wildcards can be used in the paths:
* : Matches any sequence of non-path-separator characters within a
single directory or file name.
Example (Linux): /var/log/*.log matches all files ending in .log
directly within /var/log/ .
Example (Linux): /var/log/app_*/server.log matches
/var/log/app_1/server.log and /var/log/app_2/server.log , but
doesn't match /var/log/app_1/v2/server.log .
** (globstar): Matches zero or more directories in a path. This pattern
is used to match files across multiple directory levels (recursively).
Example (Linux): /var/log/**/*.log matches any file ending with
.log within /var/log or any of its subdirectories at any
depth (e.g., /var/log/app1.log , /var/log/apache2/access.log ).
Example (Linux): To collect logs from application instances that create
versioned or instance-specific subdirectories, like
/opt/my-app/logs/instance-01/app.log ,
/opt/my-app/logs/groupA/instance-02/app.log ,
globstar can be used:
/opt/my-app/logs/**/*.log
Note: When specifying wildcards on Windows, you must use
\ as a separator.
For a list of common Linux application log files, see
Common Linux log files .
exclude_paths : Optional. A list of filesystem path patterns to
exclude from the set matched by include_paths .
record_log_file_path : Optional. If set to true , then the path to the
specific file from which the log record was obtained appears in the
output log entry as the value of the agent.googleapis.com/log_file_path
label. When using a wildcard, only the path of the file from which the
record was obtained is recorded.
wildcard_refresh_interval : Optional. The interval at which wildcard
file paths in include_paths are refreshed. Given as a time duration,
for example, 30s , 2m . This property might be useful under high
logging throughputs where log files are rotated faster than the default
interval. If not specified, the default interval is 60 seconds.
fluent_forward receivers:
listen_host : Optional. An IP address to listen on.
The default value is 127.0.0.1 .
listen_port : Optional. A port to listen on.
The default value is 24224 .
syslog receivers (for Linux only):
transport_protocol : Supported values: tcp , udp .
listen_host : An IP address to listen on.
listen_port : A port to listen on.
tcp receivers:
format : Required. Log format. Supported value: json .
listen_host : Optional. An IP address to listen on.
The default value is 127.0.0.1 .
listen_port : Optional. A port to listen on.
The default value is 5170 .
windows_event_log receivers (for Windows only):
channels : Required. A list of Windows Event Log channels from
which to read logs.
receiver_version : Optional. Controls which Windows Event Log API to use.
Supported values are 1 and 2 . The default value is 1 .
Caution: Version 1 is supported for backwards compatibility only. When
configuring a new receiver, use version 2 . To
read from channels under the "Applications and Services" category in Event
Viewer, you must use version 2 .
render_as_xml : Optional. If set to true , then all Event Log fields,
except for jsonPayload.Message and jsonPayload.StringInserts , are
rendered as an XML document in a string field named jsonPayload.raw_xml .
The default value is false . This cannot be set to true when
receiver_version is 1 .

Special fields in structured payloads
For processors and receivers that can ingest structured data (the
fluent_forward and tcp receivers and the parse_json processor), you can
set special fields in the input that will map to specific fields in the
LogEntry object that the agent writes to the Logging API.
When the Ops Agent receives external structured log data, it places
top-level fields into the LogEntry 's jsonPayload field unless the field
name is listed in the following table:
Record field
LogEntry field
Option 1
"timestamp": {
"seconds": CURRENT_SECONDS,
"nanos": CURRENT_NANOS,
}
Option 2
{
"timestampSeconds": CURRENT_SECONDS,
"timestampNanos": CURRENT_NANOS,
}
timestamp
receiver_id (not a record field)
logName
logging.googleapis.com/httpRequest ( HttpRequest )
httpRequest
logging.googleapis.com/severity ( string )
severity
logging.googleapis.com/labels ( struct of string:string )
labels
logging.googleapis.com/operation ( struct )
operation
logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation ( struct )
sourceLocation
logging.googleapis.com/trace ( string )
trace
logging.googleapis.com/spanId ( string )
spanId
Any remaining structured record fields remain part of the jsonPayload
structure.

Default ingested labels
Logs can contain the following labels by default in the LogEntry :
Field
Sample Value
Description
labels."compute.googleapis.com/resource_name"
test_vm
The name of the virtual machine from which this log originates. Written for all logs.
labels."logging.googleapis.com/instrumentation_source"
agent.googleapis.com/apache_access
The value of the receiver type from which thus log originates, prefixed by agent.googleapis.com/ . Written only by receivers from third-party integrations.
Logging processors
The optional processors element contains a set of processing directives, each
identified by a PROCESSOR_ID . A processor describes how to manipulate the
information collected by a receiver.
Each processor must have a unique identifier and include a type element. The
valid types are:
parse_json : Parse JSON-formatted structured logs.
parse_multiline : Parse multiline logs. (Linux only)
parse_regex : Parse text-formatted logs via regex patterns to turn them into
JSON-formatted structured logs.
exclude_logs : Exclude logs that match specified rules (starting in 2.9.0).
modify_fields : Set/transform fields in log entries (starting in 2.14.0).
The processors structure looks like the following:
processors:
PROCESSOR_ID :
type: parse_json
...
PROCESSOR_ID_2 :
type: parse_regex
...
Depending on the value of the type element, there are other
configuration options, as follows.
parse_json processor
Configuration structure
processors :
PROCESSOR_ID :
type : parse_json
time_key : < field name within jsonPayload >
time_format : < strptime format string >
The parse_json processor parses the input JSON into the jsonPayload field
of the LogEntry . Other parts of the LogEntry can be parsed by setting
certain special top-level fields .
time_key : Optional. If the log entry provides a field with a timestamp,
this option specifies the name of that field. The extracted value is used
to set the timestamp field of the resulting
LogEntry
and is removed from the payload.
If the time_key option is specified, you must also specify the
following:
time_format : Required if time_key is used. This option
specifies the format of the time_key field so it can be
recognized and analyzed properly. For details of the format,
see the strptime(3) guide.
Example configuration
processors :
PROCESSOR_ID :
type : parse_json
time_key : time
time_format : "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%L%Z"
parse_multiline processor
Configuration structure
processors :
PROCESSOR_ID :
type : parse_multiline
match_any :
- type : < type of the exceptions >
language : < language name >
match_any : Required. A list of one or more rules.
type : Required. Only a single value is supported:
language_exceptions : Allows the processor to concatenate exceptions into one LogEntry , based on the value of the language option.
language : Required. Only a single value is supported:
java : Concatenates common Java exceptions into one LogEntry .
python : Concatenates common Python exceptions into one LogEntry .
go : Concatenates common Go exceptions into one LogEntry .
Example configuration
logging :
receivers :
custom_file1 :
type : files
include_paths :
- /tmp/test-multiline28
processors :
parse_java_multiline :
type : parse_multiline
match_any :
- type : language_exceptions
language : java
extract_structure :
type : parse_regex
field : message
regex : "^(?<time>[ \ d-]*T[ \ d:.Z]*) (?<severity>[^ ]*) (?<file>[^ :]*):(?<line>[ \ d]*) - (?<message>(.|\\n)*)$"
time_key : time
time_format : "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%L"
move_severity :
type : modify_fields
fields :
severity :
move_from : jsonPayload.severity
service :
pipelines :
pipeline1 :
receivers : [ custom_file1 ]
processors : [ parse_java_multiline , extract_structure , move_severity ]
In the extract_structure processor, the field: message statement means
that the regular expression is applied to the log entry's jsonPayload.message
field. By default, the files receiver places each line of the log file into a
log entry with a single payload field called jsonPayload.message .
The extract_structure processor places extracted fields into
subfields of the LogEntry.jsonPayload field. Other statements in the YAML
file cause two of the extracted fields, time and severity , to be moved.
The time_key: time statement pulls the LogEntry.jsonPayload.time field,
parses the timestamp, and then adds the LogEntry.timestamp field.
The move_severity processor moves the severity field from the
LogEntry.jsonPayload.severity field to the LogEntry.severity field.

regex : "^(?<time>[^ ]*) (?<severity>[^ ]*) (?<msg>.*)$"
time_key : time
time_format : "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%L%Z"
exclude_logs processor
Configuration structure:
type : exclude_logs
match_any :
- < filter >
- < filter >
The top-level configuration for this processor contains a single field,
match_any , which contains a list of filter rules.
match_any : Required. A list of one or more rules. If a log entry
matches any rule, then the Ops Agent doesn't ingest that entry.
The logs that are ingested by Ops Agent follow the
LogEntry structure .
Field names are case-sensitive. You can only specify rules based on the
following fields and their subfields:
httpRequest
jsonPayload
labels
operation
severity
sourceLocation
trace
spanId
The following example rule
severity =~ "(DEBUG|INFO)"
uses a regular expression to exclude all DEBUG and INFO level logs.
Rules follow the Cloud Logging query
language syntax but only
support a subset of the features that Logging query
language supports:
Comparison operators: = , != , : , =~ , !~ .
Only string comparisons are supported.
Navigation operator: . . For example jsonPayload.message .
Boolean operators: AND , OR , NOT .
Grouping expressions with ( ) .
Note: Using the exclude_logs processor has performance
implications, so it's recommended that you avoid using this processor if you
can exclude logs from the source or if you can set up
exclusion filters . If
you need to use the exclude_logs processor, we recommend the
following best practices:
Minimize the number of exclude_logs processors.
Use exact matches whenever possible instead of using
regular-expression matches.
Example configuration
processors :
PROCESSOR_ID :
type : exclude_logs
match_any :
- '(jsonPayload.message =~ "log spam 1" OR jsonPayload.message =~ "log spam 2") AND severity = "ERROR"'
- 'jsonPayload.application = "foo" AND severity = "INFO"'
modify_fields Processor
The modify_fields processor allows customization of the structure and
contents of log entries.
Configuration structure
type : modify_fields
fields :
< destination field > :
# Source
move_from : < source field >
copy_from : < source field >
static_value : < string >
# Mutation
default_value : < string >
map_values :
< old value > : < new value >
type : { integer|float }
omit_if : < filter >
The top-level configuration for this processor contains a single field,
fields , which contains a map of output field names and corresponding
translations. For each output field, an optional source and zero or more
mutation operations are applied.
All field names use
the dot-separated syntax
from the Cloud Logging query language. Filters use the Cloud Logging query
language.
All transformations are applied in parallel, which means that sources and
filters operate on the original input log entry and therefore can not reference
the new value of any other fields being modified by the same processor.
Source options : At most one specified source is allowed.
No source specified
If no source value is specified, the existing value in the destination
field will be modified.
move_from: <source field>
The value from <source field> will be used as the source for the
destination field. Additionally, <source field> will be removed from
the log entry. If a source field is referenced by both move_from and
copy_from , the source field will still be removed.
copy_from: <source field>
The value from <source field> will be used as the source for the
destination field. <source field> will not be removed from the log
entry unless it is also referenced by a move_from operation or
otherwise modified.
static_value: <string>
The static string <string> will be used as the source for the
destination field.
Mutation options : Zero or more mutation operators may be applied to a
single field. If multiple operators are supplied, they will always be applied
in the following order.
default_value: <string>
If the source field did not exist, the output value will be set to
<string> . If the source field already exists (even if it contains an
empty string), the original value is unmodified.
map_values: <map>
If the input value matches one of the keys in <map> , the output value
will be replaced with the corresponding value from the map.
map_values_exclusive: {true|false}
In case the <source field> value does not match any keys specified in the
map_values pairs, the destination field will be forcefully unset if
map_values_exclusive is true, or left untouched if map_values_exclusive
is false.
type: {integer|float}
The input value will be converted to an integer or a float. If the
string cannot be converted to a number, the output value will be unset.
If the string contains a float but the type is specified as integer ,
the number will be truncated to an integer.
Note that the Cloud Logging API uses JSON and therefore it does not
support a full 64-bit integer; if a 64-bit (or larger) integer is
needed, it must be stored as a string in the log entry.
omit_if: <filter>
If the filter matches the input log record, the output field will be
unset. This can be used to remove placeholder values, such as:
httpRequest.referer :
move_from : jsonPayload.referer
omit_if : httpRequest.referer = "-"
Sample Configurations
The parse_json processor would transform a JSON file containing
{
"http_status" : "400" ,
"path" : "/index.html" ,
"referer" : "-"
}
into a LogEntry structure
that looks like this:
{
"jsonPayload" : {
"http_status" : "400" ,
"path" : "/index.html" ,
"referer" : "-"
}
}
This could then be transformed with modify_fields into this LogEntry :
{
"httpRequest" : {
"status" : 400 ,
"requestUrl" : "/index.html" ,
}
}
by using this Ops Agent configuration:
logging :
receivers :
in :
type : files
include_paths :
- /var/log/http.json
processors :
parse_json :
type : parse_json
set_http_request :
type : modify_fields
fields :
httpRequest.status :
move_from : jsonPayload.http_status
type : integer
httpRequest.requestUrl :
move_from : jsonPayload.path
httpRequest.referer :
move_from : jsonPayload.referer
omit_if : jsonPayload.referer = "-"
service :
pipelines :
pipeline :
receivers : [ in ]
processors : [ parse_json , set_http_request ]
This configuration reads JSON-formatted logs from /var/log/http.json and
populates part of the httpRequest structure from fields in the logs.
Logging service
The logging service customizes verbosity for the Ops Agent's own logs, and
links logging receivers and processors together into pipelines. The service
section has the following elements:
log_level
pipelines
Log verbosity level
The log_level field, available with Ops Agent versions 2.6.0 and later,
customizes verbosity for Ops Agent logging submodule's own logs. The default
is info . Available options are: error , warn , info , debug , trace .
Warning: Setting the log_level to debug (or trace ) triggers a feedback
loop in the logging sub-agent, resulting in a continuous stream of logs. This is
a known issue, and is being addressed. In the meantime, do not set
log_level to anything above info .
The following configuration customizes log verbosity for the logging submodule
to be debug instead:
logging :
service :
log_level : debug
Logging pipelines
The pipelines field can contain multiple pipeline IDs and definitions. Each
pipeline value consists of the following elements:
receivers : Required for new pipelines. A list of
receiver IDs, as described in Logging receivers .
The order of the receivers IDs in the list doesn't matter. The pipeline
collects data from all of the listed receivers.
processors : Optional. A list of processor IDs, as described in
Logging processors . The order of the processor IDs
in the list matters. Each record is run through the processors in
the listed order.
Example logging service configurations
A service configuration has the following structure:
service:
log_level: CUSTOM_LOG_LEVEL
pipelines:
PIPELINE_ID :
receivers: [...]
processors: [...]
PIPELINE_ID_2 :
receivers: [...]
processors: [...]
To stop the agent from collecting and sending either /var/log/message or
/var/log/syslog entries, redefine the default pipeline with
an empty receivers list and no processors. This configuration does not
stop the agent's logging subcomponent, because the agent must be able
to collect logs for the monitoring subcomponent. The entire empty logging
configuration looks like the following:
logging :
service :
pipelines :
default_pipeline :
receivers : []
The following service configuration defines a pipeline with the ID
custom_pipeline :
logging :
service :
pipelines :
custom_pipeline :
receivers :
- RECEIVER_ID
processors :
- PROCESSOR_ID
Metrics configurations
The metrics configuration uses the configuration model
described previously:
receivers : a list of receiver definitions. A receiver describes the
source of the metrics; for example, system metrics like cpu or memory .
The receivers in this list can be shared among multiple pipelines.
processors : a list of processor definitions. A processor describes
how to modify the metrics collected by a receiver.
service : contains a pipelines section that is a list of pipeline
definitions. A pipeline connects a list of receivers and a list of
processors to form the data flow.
The following sections describe each of these elements.
The Ops Agent sends metrics to Cloud Monitoring. You can't configure
it to export metrics to other services.
Metrics receivers
The receivers element contains a set of receiver definitions. A receiver
describes from where to retrieve the metrics, such as cpu and memory .
A receiver can be shared among multiple pipelines.
Structure of metrics receivers
Each receiver must have an identifier, RECEIVER_ID , and include a type
element. Valid built-in types are:
hostmetrics
iis (Windows only)
mssql (Windows only)
A receiver can also specify the operation collection_interval option. The
value is in the format of a duration, for example, 30s or 2m . The default
value is 60s .
Each of these receiver types collects a set of metrics; for information about
the specific metrics included, see
Metrics ingested by the receivers .
Changing the collection interval in the metrics receivers
Some critical workloads might require fast alerting. By reducing the
the collection interval for the metrics, you can configure more sensitive
alerts. For information on how alerts are evaluated, see
Behavior of metric-based alerting policies .
For example, the following receiver changes the collection interval for host
metrics (the receiver ID is hostmetrics ) from the default of 60 seconds to 10
seconds:
metrics :
receivers :
hostmetrics :
type : hostmetrics
collection_interval : 10s
Note: This override works because the receiver ID, hostmetrics ,
is the same as the ID of a receiver in the
built-in configuration . Any pipeline that uses
the hostmetrics receiver now uses this overridden configuration.
You can also override the collection interval for the Windows iis
and mssql metrics receivers using the same technique.
Metrics ingested by the receivers
The metrics ingested by the Ops Agent have identifiers that begin with the
following pattern: agent.googleapis.com/ GROUP .
The GROUP component identifies a set of related metrics; it
has values like cpu , network , and others.
The hostmetrics receiver
The hostmetrics receiver ingests the following metric groups. For
more information, see the linked section for each group on the
Ops Agent metrics page.

About the gpu metrics:
The hostmetrics receiver collects metrics reported by the
NVIDIA
Management Library (NVML) as
agent.googleapis.com/gpu metrics.
To collect these metrics, you must
create your VM with attached GPUs and
install the GPU driver . The hostmetrics receiver doesn't
collect these metrics on VMs with no attached GPUs.
Only Ops Agent version
2.38.0 or versions 2.41.0 or higher
are compatible with GPU monitoring. Do not install
Ops Agent versions 2.39.0
and 2.40.0 on VMs with attached GPUs.
For more information, see
Agent crashes and report mentions NVIDIA .
You can install or upgrade the NVIDIA GPU driver by using package managers or
local installation scripts. When using local installation scripts,
the Ops Agent service must be stopped before the driver
installation can proceed. To stop the agent, run the following command:
sudo systemctl stop google-cloud-ops-agent
You must also reboot the VM after installing or upgrading an NVIDIA
GPU driver.
The iis receiver (Windows only)
The iis receiver (Windows only) ingests metrics of the iis group.
For more information, see the
Agent metrics page.

Metrics processors
The processor element contains a set of processor definitions. A processor
describes metrics from the receiver type to exclude. The only supported type
is exclude_metrics , which takes a metrics_pattern option. The value is
a list of globs that match the Ops Agent metric types
you want to exclude from the group collected by a receiver. For example:
To exclude all agent CPU metrics ,
specify agent.googleapis.com/cpu/* .
To exclude the agent CPU utilization metric, specify
agent.googleapis.com/cpu/utilization .
To exclude the client-side request-count metric from the metrics
collected by the Apache Cassandra third-party
integration , specify
workloads.googleapis.com/cassandra.client.request.count .
To exclude all client-side metrics from the metrics
collected by the Apache Cassandra third-party
integration , specify
workloads.googleapis.com/cassandra.client.* .
Sample metrics processor
The following example shows the exclude_metrics processor supplied in
the built-in configurations. This processor supplies an empty metrics_pattern
value, so it doesn't exclude any metrics.
processors :
metrics_filter :
type : exclude_metrics
metrics_pattern : []
To disable the collection of all process metrics by the Ops Agent,
add the following to your config.yaml file:
metrics:
processors:
metrics_filter:
type: exclude_metrics
metrics_pattern:
- agent.googleapis.com/processes/*
This excludes process metrics from collection in the metrics_filter
processor that applies to the default pipeline in the metrics service.
Metrics service
The metrics service customizes verbosity for the Ops Agent metrics module's own
logs and links metrics receivers and processors together into pipelines. The
service section has two elements: log_level and pipelines .
Metrics verbosity level
log_level , available with Ops Agent versions 2.6.0 and later, customizes
verbosity for Ops Agent metrics submodule's own logs. The default is info .
Available options are: error , warn , info , debug .
Metrics pipelines
The service section has a single element, pipelines , which can contain
multiple pipeline IDs and definitions. Each pipeline
definition consists of the following elements:
receivers : Required for new pipelines. A list of receiver IDs, as described
in Metrics receivers . The order of the receivers IDs
in the list doesn't matter. The pipeline collects data from all of the
listed receivers.
processors : Optional. A list of processor IDs, as described in
Metrics processors . The order of the processor IDs
in the list does matter. Each metric point is run through the processors
in the listed order.
Example metrics service configurations
A service configuration has the following structure:
service:
log_level: CUSTOM_LOG_LEVEL
pipelines:
PIPELINE_ID :
receivers: [...]
processors: [...]
PIPELINE_ID_2 :
receivers: [...]
processors: [...]
To turn off the built-in ingestion of host metrics, redefine the default
pipeline with an empty receivers list and no processors. The entire metrics
configuration looks like the following:
metrics :
service :
pipelines :
default_pipeline :
receivers : []
The following example shows the built-in service configuration for
Windows:
metrics :
service :
pipelines :
default_pipeline :
receivers :
- hostmetrics
- iis
- mssql
processors :
- metrics_filter
The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics
submodule to be debug instead:
metrics :
service :
log_level : debug
Collection of self logs
By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
These logs can include a lot of information, and the additional volume might
increase your costs to use Cloud Logging.
You can disable the collection of these self logs, starting with Ops Agent
version 2.44.0, by using the
default_self_log_file_collection option.
To disable self-log collection, add a global section to your user-specified
configuration file and set the default_self_log_file_collection option
to the value false :
logging: ...
metrics: ...
global:
default_self_log_file_collection: false
Log-rotation configuration
Starting with Ops Agent version 2.31.0,
you can also set up the agent's log-rotation feature by using the
configuration files. For more information, see Configure log rotation
in the Ops Agent .
