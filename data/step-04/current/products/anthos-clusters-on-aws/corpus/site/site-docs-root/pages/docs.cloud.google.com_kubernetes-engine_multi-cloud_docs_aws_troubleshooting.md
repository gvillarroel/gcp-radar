Common error messages
The following sections explain the causes and resolutions for some common
error messages.
Server doesn't have a resource
Errors such as error: the server doesn't have a resource type "services" can
happen when a cluster has no running node pools, or Connect gateway cannot
connect to a node pool. To check the status of your node pools, run the
following command:
gcloud container aws node-pools list \
--cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME \
--location LOCATION
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : your cluster's name
LOCATION : the Google Cloud location that manages
your cluster
The output includes the status of your cluster's node pools. If you don't have
a node pool listed, Create a node pool .
Forbidden user
The following error occurs when your username does not have administrator access
to your cluster:
Error from server (Forbidden): users "administrator@example.com" is forbidden:
User "system:serviceaccount:gke-connect:connect-agent-sa" cannot impersonate
resource "users" in API group "" at the cluster scope
You can configure additional users by passing the
--admin-users
flag when you create a cluster.
If you use Connect gateway and can't connect to your cluster, try the following
steps:
Get the authorized users for your cluster.
gcloud container aws clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--format 'value(authorization.admin_users)'
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with your cluster's name.
The output includes the usernames with administrator access to the cluster.
For example:
{'username': 'administrator@example.com'}
Get the username currently authenticated with the Google Cloud CLI.
gcloud config get-value account
The output includes the account authenticated with the Google Cloud CLI. If
the output of the gcloud containers aws clusters describe and gcloud
config get-value account don't match, run gcloud auth login and
authenticate as the username with administrative access to the cluster.
Issues with kubectl commands
The following sections provide guidance on how to resolve issues with
unresponsive or failing kubectl commands.
kubectl commands stop responding
If your cluster runs a Kubernetes version earlier than 1.25 and kubectl
commands are unresponsive or time out, the most common reason is that you have
not yet created a node pool. By default, GKE on AWS generates
kubeconfig files that use Connect gateway as an internet-reachable endpoint.
For this to work, the gke-connect-agent Deployment needs to be running in
a node pool on the cluster.
For more diagnostic information, run the following command:
kubectl cluster-info -v = 9
If there are no running node pools, you see requests to
connectgateway.googleapis.com fail with a 404
cannot find active connections for cluster error.
For clusters with a Kubernetes version of 1.25 or later, the gke-connect-agent
runs on the control plane, and a node pool is not required. If the kubectl command
is unresponsive, check the control plane component logs with
Cloud Logging .
kubectl exec, attach, and port-forward commands fail
The kubectl exec , kubectl attach , and kubectl port-forward commands might
fail with the message error: unable to upgrade connection when using
Connect gateway. This is a limitation when using Connect gateway as your
Kubernetes API Server endpoint.
To work around this, use a kubeconfig that specifies the cluster's
private endpoint. For instructions on accessing the cluster through its
private endpoint, see
Configure cluster access for kubectl .
kubectl logs fails with remote error: tls: internal error
This issue might happen when the Control Plane API
Role is
missing a permission. For example, this can happen if your AWS role is missing
the ec2:DescribeDhcpOptions permission. In this case, certificate signing
requests from nodes can't be approved, and the worker node lacks a valid
certificate.
To determine if this is the problem, you can check if there are pending Certificate
Signing Requests that have not been approved with this command:
kubectl get csr
To resolve this,
verify that your AWS role matches the requirements .
Generic kubectl troubleshooting
If you use Connect gateway:
Ensure you have enabled Connect gateway in your Google Cloud project:
gcloud services enable connectgateway.googleapis.com
For clusters with a Kubernetes version earlier than 1.25, ensure that you have at
least one Linux node pool running and that the gke-connect-agent is running.
For details, see
Troubleshoot cluster connections .
For clusters with a Kubernetes version of 1.25 or later, check the gke-connect-agent
logs with Cloud Logging .
Kubernetes Service (LoadBalancer) or Kubernetes Ingress don't work
If your AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB/NLB/ALB) were created but aren't operating
as you expected, this might be due to problems with subnet tagging. For more
information, see
Load balancer subnets .
Pods on Arm nodes crashing
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
The following issue occurs when you deploy a Pod on an Arm node, but the
container image isn't built for Arm architecture.
To identify the issue, complete the following tasks:
Get the status of your Pods:
kubectl get pods
Get the logs for the crashing Pod:
kubectl logs POD_NAME
Replace POD_NAME with the name of the crashing Pod.
The error message in your Pod logs is similar to the following:
exec ./hello-app: exec format error
To resolve this issue, ensure that your container image supports Arm
architecture. As a best practice, build multiple architecture images.
Cannot delete cluster
If you receive an error similar to the following when you try to delete a
cluster, your GKE Multi-Cloud API role might not exist:
ERROR: (gcloud.container.aws.clusters.delete) FAILED_PRECONDITION: Could not
assume role
"arn:aws:iam:: ACCOUNT_NUMBER :role/gke123456-anthos-api-role"
through service account
"service-123456789@gcp-sa-gkemulticloud.iam.gserviceaccount.com".
Please make sure the role has a trust policy allowing the GCP service agent to
assume it: WebIdentityErr failed to retrieve credentials
To fix the problem, follow the steps at
Create GKE Multi-Cloud API role .
When you re-create the role with the same name and permissions, you can re-try
the command.
