Google Cloud management regions overview

Google Cloud management regions and locations
Clusters created with GKE on AWS are located in a AWS
region. When you create a cluster, you specify both an AWS region
for your cluster and a Google Cloud region that manages the cluster.
Each Google Cloud region can manage clusters in a specific set of
nearby AWS regions.
For example, the Google Cloud region us-west1 , located in Oregon, manages clusters
in two AWS regions: us-west-1 in Northern California and us-west-2 in
Oregon.
Managing your clusters from nearby Google Cloud regions improves availability
and reduces the latency of cluster management operations.
GKE on AWS includes the cluster's Google Cloud region in
the cluster's resource name. For example, a cluster named my-cluster created
in project my-project on region us-west1 has a resource name of
projects/my-project/locations/us-west1/awsClusters/my-cluster . By contrast,
the AWS region is part of the cluster resource. You can specify it in the
aws_region field of API calls.
Data locality
To manage your clusters, the GKE Multi-Cloud API must store
information about your cluster's state in the Google Cloud region you specified
when creating the cluster. This data doesn't include workload-specific data
(which is stored in your cluster's region) but does include
information such as AWS resource IDs and public key infrastructure (PKI)
data.
If your application needs to store its data in a particular geographic region,
specify an AWS region and its associated
Google Cloud management region that comply with your requirements when you
create your clusters.

You can fetch the most up-to-date list of current AWS regions
supported by a
Google Cloud region by
running the following gcloud command:
gcloud container aws get-server-config --location GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION
Replace GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION with the name of the Google Cloud region you're
querying.
