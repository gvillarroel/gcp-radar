| SQL Server
This page describes exporting and importing data into Cloud SQL instances using
BAK files and importing data into Cloud SQL instances using transaction log files.
Note: In Cloud SQL, SQL Server currently supports
the export of native BAK files.
If you're exporting to create a new instance from the exported
file, consider
restoring from a backup to a different instance
or cloning the instance .
WARNING! Don't use a BAK file created from a read-only database or from a database that is in single-user mode. If you
import a BAK file created from a read-only database or from a database that's in
single-user mode, then an error might occur.
Before you begin
Important: Before starting a large export, ensure that at least 25 percent
of the database size is free (on the instance). Doing so helps prevent
issues with aggressive autogrowth, which can affect the availability
of the instance.
Exports use database resources, but exports don't interfere with normal
database operations unless the instance is under-provisioned.
For best practices, see
Best Practices for Importing and
Exporting Data .
After completing an import operation,
verify the
results.
Export data from Cloud SQL for SQL Server
Cloud SQL supports the export of built-in BAK files.
If you aim to create a new instance from an exported file, then
consider
restoring from a backup to a different instance
or cloning the instance .
Cloud SQL performs a full backup
of the selected database during an export operation.
Note: For information about striped export, see
Use striped export .
Required roles and permissions for exporting from Cloud SQL for SQL Server
To export
data from Cloud SQL into Cloud Storage, the user initiating the export must have
one of the following roles:
The Cloud SQL Editor role
A custom role ,
including the following permissions:
cloudsql.instances.get
cloudsql.instances.export
Additionally, the service account for the Cloud SQL instance must have one of the following roles:
The storage.objectAdmin Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
A custom role, including the following permissions:
storage.objects.create
storage.objects.list (for striped export and transaction log export)
storage.objects.delete (for striped export and transaction log export)
storage.buckets.get (for transaction log export only)
For help with
IAM roles, see
Identity and Access Management .
Note : The changes that you make to the IAM permissions and roles might take
a few minutes to take effect. For more information, see
Access change propagation .
Export data to a BAK file from Cloud SQL for SQL Server
Note: You can't export a
database snapshot
to a BAK file.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Click Export .
In the File format section, click BAK .
In the Data to export section, use the drop-down menu to select the
database you want to export from.
In the Destination section, select Browse to search for a
Cloud Storage bucket or folder for your export.
Click Export to begin the export.
gcloud
Create a Cloud Storage bucket .
Find the service account for the Cloud SQL instance you're exporting
from. You can do this running the gcloud sql instances describe
command. Look for the serviceAccountEmailAddress field in the
output.
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
Use
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding to grant the
storage.objectAdmin
IAM role
to the service account. For more information about setting IAM
permissions, see
Using IAM permissions .
Export the database:
gcloud sql export bak INSTANCE_NAME gs:// BUCKET_NAME / FILENAME \
--database = DATABASE_NAME
For information about using the gcloud sql export bak
command, see the
command reference page .
If you don't need to retain the IAM role you set
previously, then revoke
it now.
REST v1
Create a Cloud Storage bucket for the export.
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME --location = LOCATION_NAME --project = PROJECT_NAME
This step isn't required, but strongly recommended, so you don't open up

Export differential database backups
Before exporting a differential database backup , you must export a differential base.
If other services or features, such as point-in-time recovery and read replica,
trigger a full backup between your full backup export and differential backup export,
then you must trigger a full backup export again.
To understand this better, consider the following example:
You raise a full backup request at 7:00 AM.
You enable point-in-time recovery at 9:00 AM. This triggers a full backup on your
instance.
You try to take a differential backup at 5:00 PM. This export request fails with
an error message because the last full backup was triggered by point-in-time recovery.
Note: On an instance enabled with point-in-time recovery, Cloud SQL triggers a daily backup and this daily backup also triggers a full database backup. This means that on an instance enabled with point-in-time recovery, you have to take full backup and differential backup within two consecutive daily backups.
Cloud SQL doesn't support database export requests with --differential-base or --bak-type=DIFF on replica instances.
gcloud
Create a Cloud Storage bucket.
Find the service account for the Cloud SQL instance from which you're exporting.
You can do this running the gcloud sql instances describe
command. Look for the serviceAccountEmailAddress field in the
output.
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
Use
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding to grant the
storage.objectAdmin
IAM role
to the service account. For more information about setting IAM
permissions, see
Using IAM permissions .
Export the database as the differential base.

Export transaction logs
You can export the transaction logs for all Cloud SQL for SQL Server instances that
have point-in-time recovery (PITR)
enabled and their logs stored in Cloud Storage.
gcloud
Create a Cloud Storage bucket for the export.
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME --location = LOCATION_NAME --project = PROJECT_NAME
This step isn't required, but strongly recommended, so you don't open up
access to any other data.
Find the service account for the Cloud SQL instance from which you're exporting.
You can do this by running the gcloud sql instances describe
command. Look for the serviceAccountEmailAddress field in the
output.
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
Use
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding to grant the
storage.Admin
IAM role
to the service account. For more information about setting IAM

retention period in the Cloud Storage bucket. The log retention period
can range from 1 to 35 days for Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition edition and 1 to 7
days for Cloud SQL Enterprise edition edition.
If you want to export transaction logs continually, then don't use the --export-log-start-time parameter
and always export to the same location in Cloud Storage. Cloud SQL
doesn't export any log files that already exist in the destination repeatedly.

Use striped export
The advantages of striped export are the following:
Reductions in the time needed for operations to complete
Databases larger than 5 TB can be exported
A potential disadvantage of using striped export is that the backup, rather than
consisting of one file, is split across a set of files. This set is called a
"stripe set"; see
Backup devices in a striped media set (a stripe set) .
In Cloud SQL, you export to an empty folder
in Cloud Storage instead of generating a single file. For more information, see
How to use striped export .
Planning your operations
Striped export can improve the performance of exports. However, if your use
case requires a single output file, or if
your database is less than 5 TB in size, and if faster performance isn't
critical, you may want to use a non-striped export.
If you decide to use striped export, then consider the
number of stripes. You can specify this value in your
gcloud CLI command or REST API call. However, if you want an optimal number of
stripes for performance, or if you don't know a number, omit the number.
An optimal number of stripes is set automatically.
The maximum number of stripes currently supported by
Cloud SQL for SQL Server is 64.
How to use striped export
gcloud
Create a Cloud Storage bucket.
Find the service account for the Cloud SQL instance you're exporting
from. You can do this by running the
gcloud sql instances describe command. Look for the
serviceAccountEmailAddress field in the output.
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
Use
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding to grant the
storage.objectAdmin
IAM role
to the service account. For more information about setting IAM
permissions, see
Using IAM permissions .
To export the database, specify the --striped parameter
and/or specify a value for --stripe_count .
Setting a value for --stripe_count
implies that the --striped parameter is intended. An error
occurs if you specify --no-striped but specify a value for
--stripe_count :
gcloud beta sql export bak INSTANCE_NAME \
gs:// BUCKET_NAME / STRIPED_EXPORT_FOLDER \
--database = DATABASE_NAME --striped --stripe_count = NUMBER
For information about using the gcloud beta sql export bak
command, see the
command reference page .
If you don't need to retain the IAM role you set
previously, then
revoke it now.
REST v1
Create a Cloud Storage bucket for the export.
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME --location = LOCATION_NAME --project = PROJECT_NAME

Import to Cloud SQL for SQL Server
Required roles and permissions for importing to Cloud SQL for SQL Server
To import
data from Cloud Storage into Cloud SQL, the user initiating the import must have
one of the following roles:
The Cloud SQL Admin role
A custom role ,
including the following permissions:
cloudsql.instances.get
cloudsql.instances.import
Additionally, the service account for the Cloud SQL instance must have one of the following roles:
The storage.objectAdmin IAM role
A custom role, including the following permissions:
storage.objects.get
storage.objects.list (for striped import only)
For help with
IAM roles, see
Identity and Access Management .
Note : The changes that you make to the IAM permissions and roles might take
a few minutes to take effect. For more information, see
Access change propagation .
Import data from a BAK file to Cloud SQL for SQL Server
To use striped import, see Use striped import .
Various import frameworks are available. For example, Cloud SQL for SQL Server
supports
change data capture (CDC) for the following database versions:
SQL Server 2017 Standard
SQL Server 2017 Enterprise
SQL Server 2019 Standard
SQL Server 2019 Enterprise
SQL Server 2022 Standard
SQL Server 2022 Enterprise
When importing a CDC-enabled database, the
KEEP_CDC
flag is retained.
Note: You can't import a database that was exported
from a higher version of SQL Server or import from a higher compatibility level
into a lower one. For example, if you exported a SQL Server 2017
version, you can't import it into a SQL Server 2014 version.
If your instance version is a Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition, then
you can import encrypted BAK files.
Microsoft SQL Server Standard Edition instances also import encrypted BAK files,
but only through gcloud CLI.
The only supported BAK extensions are
.bak and .bak.gz . GPG encrypted backups
are not currently supported.
For the instructions below, prepare to specify a new database; don't
create a database before starting the import of your BAK file.
Note: Cloud SQL only supports importing a
full backup with a single backup set.
To import data to a Cloud SQL instance using a BAK file:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Click Import .
In the Choose a file to import from field,
enter the path to the bucket and the BAK file to use for the import.
You can import a compressed ( .gz ) or an uncompressed
file.
In the File format section, select BAK .
If you're importing data into a Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition instance,
then you can import encrypted BAK files. Cloud SQL Enterprise edition instances also support importing encrypted BAK files, but only through the gcloud CLI .
To import an encrypted BAK file, do the following:
Select Encrypted BAK .
In the Certificate field, select the certificate that you want
to import. This certificate is issued by a third-party certificate
authority (CA).
In the Private key field, select the file that contains the
private key that you want to import. The private key is used to
encrypt and decrypt data that's sent from a source to a destination
Cloud SQL instance.
In the Password field, enter the password for the private key.
In the Destination section, specify the database in
your Cloud SQL instance where you want to import the BAK file.
To start the import, click Import .
gcloud
Create a Cloud Storage bucket for the import.
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME --location = LOCATION_NAME --project = PROJECT_NAME
This step isn't required, but strongly recommended, so you don't open up

Make sure you have configured the required roles and permissions.
Upload
the data from the BAK file to the bucket.
Describe the instance that you are importing to:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
Copy the serviceAccountEmailAddress field.
Use
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding to grant the
storage.objectViewer

Import differential database backups
Before you import a differential database backup , you need a full backup import and your database must be in the RESTORING state after the full backup import.
Cloud SQL doesn't support importing differential database backups on instances that are enabled with point-in-time recovery. This is because importing a database backup with --no-recovery is a prerequisite for importing differential database backups. Additionally, you can't enable point-in-time recovery on an instance if the database is in the RESTORING state.
In the case of import failure, do one of the following to enable point-in-time recovery:
Bring the database that's in the RESTORING state online by using the --recovery-only flag.
Remove the database.
To import data to a Cloud SQL instance using a differential database backup, perform the following steps:
gcloud
Create a Cloud Storage bucket for the import.
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME --location = LOCATION_NAME --project = PROJECT_NAME
This step isn't mandatory, but we strongly recommend that you perform it so that you don't open up
access to any other data.
Make sure that you've configured the required roles and permissions.
Upload
the data from the BAK file to the bucket.
Describe the instance that you are importing to:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
Copy the serviceAccountEmailAddress field.
Use
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding to grant the
storage.objectViewer
IAM role
to the service account for the bucket.
For more information about setting IAM permissions, see
Using IAM permissions .
Import a full backup with --no-recovery .
gcloud sql import bak INSTANCE_NAME gs:// BUCKET_NAME / DIFFERENTIAL_BASE_FILENAME \
--database = DATABASE_NAME --bak-type = FULL --no-recovery
Import a differential database backup.
gcloud sql import bak INSTANCE_NAME gs:// BUCKET_NAME / DIFFERENTIAL_BACKUP_FILENAME \

Import transaction log backups
A transaction log
is a record of your database's transactions and the modifications made by each transaction.
You can use it to re-establish database consistency in the event of a system failure.
Note :
Cloud SQL doesn't support striped import of transaction log backups.
Cloud SQL doesn't support importing transaction log backups on instances that are
enabled with point-in-time recovery. This is because importing a database backup
with --no-recovery is a prerequisite for importing transaction log backups.
Additionally, you can't enable point-in-time recovery on an instance if the database is in the RESTORING state.
In the case of import failure, do one of the following to enable point-in-time recovery:
Bring the database that's in the RESTORING state online by using the --recovery-only flag.
Remove the database.
To import data to a Cloud SQL instance using a transaction log backup, perform the following steps:
gcloud
Optional: Create a Cloud Storage bucket for the import.
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME --location = LOCATION_NAME --project = PROJECT_NAME
Upload
the backup files to the bucket.
Describe the instance that you are importing to:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
Copy the serviceAccountEmailAddress field.
Use
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding to grant the
storage.objectViewer
IAM role
to the service account for the bucket.
For more information about setting IAM permissions, see
Using IAM permissions .
Import a full backup using the --no-recovery parameter.
Ensure that your database is in the RESTORING
state after the full backup import.
gcloud sql import bak INSTANCE_NAME gs:// BUCKET_NAME / BACKUP_FILENAME \
--database = DATABASE_NAME --bak-type = FULL --no-recovery
Optional: Import a differential backup .
Import a transaction log backup.
gcloud sql import bak INSTANCE_NAME gs:// BUCKET_NAME / BACKUP_FILENAME \
--database = DATABASE_NAME --bak-type = TLOG
--stop-at = STOP_AT_TIMESTAMP --stop-at-mark = STOP_AT_MARK_NAME
--no-recovery
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_NAME : the instance name.
BUCKET_NAME : the Cloud Storage bucket name.
BACKUP_FILENAME : the name of your backup file.
DATABASE_NAME : the name of a database inside the Cloud SQL instance.
STOP_AT_TIMESTAMP : the timestamp at which the transaction log import must stop. This is an
optional field and the value
must use the RFC 3339 format .
STOP_AT_MARK_NAME : the
marked transaction
at which the transaction log import must stop. This is an
optional field and can take any string as its value. If the value is in the format lsn:log-sequence-number ,
then the transaction log import
stops at the given
log sequence number .
Repeat this step until all transaction log backups are imported.
After restoring all the backup files, use the --recovery-only
flag to bring the imported database online from a RESTORING state.
Users are strongly encouraged not to use
T-SQL
commands to bring the imported database online.
gcloud sql import bak INSTANCE_NAME \
--database = DATABASE_NAME --recovery-only
If you don't need to retain the IAM permissions you
set previously, then remove them using
gcloud storage buckets remove-iam-policy-binding .

If you don't need to retain the IAM permissions you
set previously, then remove the permissions.
Use striped import
The advantages of striped import are the following:
Reductions in the time needed for operations to complete
Databases larger than 5 TB can be imported
Note: Striped import does not support the import of encrypted columns.
A potential disadvantage of using striped import is that all of the files in the
striped set (rather than a single file) must be uploaded to the same folder in
your Cloud Storage bucket, before you perform the import.
Planning your operations
In most use cases, striped import enables better performance with no
disadvantages. However, if you can't back up to a striped set from a given
instance, or if your database is less than 5 TB, and if faster performance is
not critical, you may want to use a non-striped import.
How to use striped import
gcloud
Create a Cloud Storage bucket for the import.
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME --location = LOCATION_NAME --project = PROJECT_NAME
This step isn't required, but strongly recommended, so you don't open up
access to any other data.
Make sure you have configured the required IAM roles and permissions.
Create
a new folder in your bucket.
To import the database,
upload the files of the striped set (of the database) to the new folder.
Ensure that all the files are uploaded to the folder, and that the folder
contains no extra files.
Describe the instance you are exporting from:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME
Copy the serviceAccountEmailAddress field.
Use
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding to grant the
storage.objectViewer
IAM role to the service account for the bucket.
For more information about setting IAM permissions, see
Using IAM permissions .
Import the data from the folder. The difference from a non-striped import is
the following: The URI links to the name of the folder to which the stripe
set was uploaded, rather than to a single file, and you specify the
--striped parameter:
gcloud beta sql import bak INSTANCE_NAME gs:// BUCKET_NAME / FOLDER_NAME \
--database = DATABASE_NAME --striped
If you don't need to retain the IAM permissions you
set previously, then remove them using
gcloud storage buckets remove-iam-policy-binding .
