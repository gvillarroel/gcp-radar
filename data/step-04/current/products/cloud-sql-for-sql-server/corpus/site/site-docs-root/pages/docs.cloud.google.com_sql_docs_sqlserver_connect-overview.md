This page provides an overview of the ways in which you can connect to your
Cloud SQL instance.
Before you can connect to a Cloud SQL instance, you need to
decide how to deploy and configure your Cloud SQL instance and
supporting networking resources. If your Cloud SQL instance is
already configured and deployed, then this page can help you understand
the different ways that you can connect your clients to the
existing instance.
IP address type: private or public
When you first create your Cloud SQL instance,
you can choose whether to configure the instance with a public IP address ,
a private IP address , or a combination of both .
You choose the IP address configuration of your instance based on your
application requirements. Then after you configure your instance, you
specify either a public IP address, a private IP address, or in some cases a
DNS name in your client connection string.
Private IP address
Public IP address
Description
Internal, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network-only (private) IP address
An external, internet-accessible (public) IP address
Decision points
Do you need to connect from clients hosted on VPC networks
inside Google Cloud or from clients that have access to those VPC networks?
If yes, then choose a private IP address for the instance.
Do you need to connect from clients outside the Google Cloud
VPC network over the public
internet?
If yes, then choose a public IP address for the instance.
Configuration options
The following types of private
networking configurations are supported:
Private services access :
connect to Cloud SQL instances from a
single VPC network based on networking peering.
Private Service Connect :
connect to Cloud SQL instances from multiple VPC networks
that belong to different groups, projects, or organizations.
For more information about choosing a private networking configuration,
see Private networking options: private services access or Private Service Connect .
When you connect directly to an instance using a public IP address,
you must configure authorized networks .
Another more secure alternative for connecting to a Cloud SQL instance that uses public IP
is to use a Cloud SQL connector (such as the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or one of the Cloud SQL Language Connectors).
For instructions about adding a public IP to your instance, see
Configure public IP .
To connect to a Cloud SQL instance using a public IP address,
you can use the sqlcmd client or another available client.
Summary
Recommendation :
For improved security, we recommend that you
configure your instance with a private IP address type unless you have specific
requirements for an internet-accessible Cloud SQL instance, or
if you're connecting from a client that doesn't
meet the requirements for a VPC.
Connection type: Cloud SQL connector or direct
When you make the connection to a Cloud SQL instance, you can use a
Cloud SQL connector, or you can make a direct connection.
A Cloud SQL connector is either the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or
one of the Cloud SQL Language Connectors .
Cloud SQL connector
Direct connection
Description
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, a client-side proxy, and Cloud SQL Language Connectors,
client-side libraries, provide simplified and secure access to your
Cloud SQL instances, especially when you connect to an
instance using a public IP address.
A direct connection from a client to a
Cloud SQL instance provides a lower latency connection.
A direct connection can be made from either a public or a private IP address.
Decision points
Cloud SQL connectors are beneficial in the following scenarios:
When you want to connect to a Cloud SQL instance using a public IP address
without having to configure authorized networks .
When you want to encrypt traffic to and from the database automatically with server
and client identity verification without having to manage SSL certificates.
When you're using IAM database authentication and want to refresh your OAuth 2.0 access tokens automatically.
When you're connecting from a client or application that uses a dynamically assigned
or ephemeral IP address. Dynamic IP configuration can be common for Platform as
a Service (PaaS) applications.
Using a direct connection provides the following benefits:
Lower latency compared to connections using Cloud SQL connectors.
No additional package or library dependency unlike Cloud SQL connectors.
When you use a direct connection, you're responsible for configuring the SSL/TLS settings.
Configuration options
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy , or
Cloud SQL Language Connectors, including
Cloud SQL Java connector
Cloud SQL Python connector
Cloud SQL Go connector
Cloud SQL Node.js connector
The following Google Cloud services use an embedded Cloud SQL Auth Proxy when you connect
to a Cloud SQL instance over public IP address:
Cloud Run
App Engine flexible environment
App Engine standard environment
To configure SSL/TLS certificates on the Cloud SQL instance and
for your client,
do the following:
Choose a server CA mode for your instance .
Configure your instance to enforce SSL/TLS encryption for
connections on the instance .
Create client certificates.
Download your server and client certificates.
Summary
When you connect to a Cloud SQL instance, you can use
either a Cloud SQL connector, or connect directly
from clients.
General recommendation :
If you're connecting to an instance by
a private IP address , use a direct connection. We also recommend that
you enforce SSL and configure SSL/TLS certificates for your connection.
If you're connecting to an instance by
a public IP address , use a Cloud SQL connector (either the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
or one of the Cloud SQL Language Connectors).
Database authentication type: Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory or built-in
When you connect to an instance, you must authenticate as a database user.
You can choose between built-in authentication in Cloud SQL for SQL Server or
Managed Microsoft AD .
Private networking options when using a private IP address
When you configure your instance to use a private IP address, you can choose
the following private networking options: private services access,
Private Service Connect, or both.
Supported features
The following table lists the features that Cloud SQL supports when
you connect to an instance that's configured with one or both of the private
networking options.
Feature
Instance with private services access only
Instance with Private Service Connect only
Instance with both private services access and Private Service Connect
Connect from multiple VPCs
Not supported.
Supported.
Supported by using the Private Service Connect endpoint.
External replicas
Supported.
Not supported.
Supported by using outbound connectivity for private services access.
Write endpoint
Supported.
Not supported.
Supported for private services access.
Change the associated VPC network for private services access
Supported.
Not applicable.
Not supported for private services access because the instance has Private Service Connect enabled for it. Not applicable for Private Service Connect.
Visibility of the client IP address to Cloud SQL
Supported.
Not supported.
Supported by using the private services access IP address. Not supported by using the Private Service Connect endpoint.
Linked servers

Remove networking options from an instance
Cloud SQL supports the removal of the following networking options
from an instance:
Public IP from an instance with both private services access and public IP
Public IP from an instance with public IP, private services access, and Private Service Connect
Private Service Connect from an instance with both Private Service Connect and private services access
Private Service Connect from an instance with Private Service Connect, private services access, and public IP
Enable networking options for an instance
You can enable Cloud SQL supports enabling the following connection options for instances:
Private services access on an instance with public IP only
Private Service Connect on an instance with private services
access only
Private Service Connect on an instance with both private
services access and public IP
Public IP on an instance with private services access only
Limitations
You can't create an instance with both a public IP address and
Private Service Connect.
You can't remove private services access from an instance with
private services access and Private Service Connect.
You can't remove private services access from an instance with private services
access and public IP.
If you have an instance that uses only public IP, then you can't enable both
private services access and Private Service Connect at the same time.
First, enable private services access, and then enable Private Service Connect.
You can't use authorized networks to do IP address-based allowlisting for
Private Service Connect instances.
