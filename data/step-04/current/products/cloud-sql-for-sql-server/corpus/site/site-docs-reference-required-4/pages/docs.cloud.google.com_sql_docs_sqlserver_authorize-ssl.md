This page describes how you can use Secure Socket Layer (SSL), now
Transport Layer Security (TLS), from your application to encrypt
connections to Cloud SQL instances.
Overview
Cloud SQL supports connecting to an instance using the SSL/TLS
protocol. SSL/TLS connections provide a layer of
security by encrypting data-in-transit between your client and the database in
your Cloud SQL instance. Optionally, your SSL/TLS connection can
perform server identity verification by validating the server certificate
installed on the Cloud SQL instance and client identity verification
by validating the client certificate installed on the client.
Server certificates
When you create an instance, Cloud SQL automatically creates and
installs a server certificate that is signed by a certificate authority (CA).
You can download the CA certificate to the client host machine and use it to
verify the CA and server Cloud SQL identity.
Optionally, you can choose the type of CA that Cloud SQL uses to sign
the server certificate.
Certificate authority (CA) hierarchies
This section describes the three types of server certificate authority (CA)
that you can choose for your Cloud SQL instances. You have three options:
Per-instance CA : with this option, an internal CA dedicated
to each Cloud SQL instance signs the
server certificate for that instance.
Cloud SQL creates and manages these CAs. To choose per-instance CA,
select Google managed internal certificate authority (Google Cloud console) or
specify GOOGLE_MANAGED_INTERNAL_CA for
the serverCaMode setting (Cloud SQL Admin API) or the --server-ca-mode flag ( gcloud CLI ) when
you create the instance .
If you leave the setting or flag unspecified when you create an instance,
then this option is the default
value for the instance. You can't update an instance to
use the per-instance CA option if the instance is configured to use a
shared CA or customer-managed CA.
Shared CA : with this option, a CA hierarchy consisting of a root CA
and subordinate server CAs is used. The subordinate server CAs in a region
sign the server certificates and are shared across instances in the region. Using a shared CA hierarchy is helpful as you increase the
number of instances in a region because you don't
need to manage unique CAs for individual instances. By switching
to a shared CA ( GOOGLE_MANAGED_CAS_CA ), you can use a single regional CA bundle for all your instances in the region, which can simplify your client-side configuration.
Cloud SQL hosts and manages the root
CA and subordinate server CAs on Google Cloud
Certificate Authority Service (CA Service). Cloud SQL
also handles the rotation of root CA and subordinate server CAs and
provides publicly available links to the
CA certificate bundles
for download.
To choose shared
CA, specify GOOGLE_MANAGED_CAS_CA for
the serverCaMode setting (Cloud SQL Admin API) or the --server-ca-mode flag ( gcloud CLI )
when you create or
edit the instance.
You can update an existing instance to use a shared CA hierarchy
if you're using either the per-instance CA or the customer-managed CA option.
Customer-managed CA : with this option, you
create and manage
your own CA hierarchy. Choose this option if you want to manage
your own CAs and certificates. By using a customer-managed CA ( CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CAS_CA ), you can manage your own CA hierarchy
and rotation policies with CA Service.
This configuration gives you greater control and
helps you meet compliance requirements.
To choose customer-managed
CA, you need to create a CA pool and CA in
CA Service.
In Cloud SQL, specify the CA pool
and CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CAS_CA for
the serverCaMode setting (Cloud SQL Admin API) or the --server-ca-mode flag ( gcloud CLI )
when you create or
edit the instance.
You can update an existing instance to use a customer-managed CA hierarchy
if you're using either the per-instance CA or the shared CA option.
Note: You can configure the
customer-managed CA option using the gcloud CLI ,
Cloud SQL Admin API, or Terraform, but you can't configure it using the Google Cloud console.
If you select the customer-managed CA option, then the option appears selected
in Google Cloud console.
After you create or update instance, you can view which CA hierarchy is configured for
a Cloud SQL instance by using the gcloud sql instances describe command
or in the Google Cloud console.
For more information, see View instance information .

CA trust anchor for TLS connections
The unique per-instance CA is the trust anchor for the corresponding instance.
Root CA and subordinate CAs are the trust anchors for all instances in a given region.
The CAs that you create and manage are the trust anchors.
Server identity verification
Verifying the CA verifies the server identity since each instance
has a unique CA.
Verifying the hostname along with verifying the CA is required for
server identity verification since server CAs are shared across instances.
Although the CA might not be shared across instances, you might want to
verify the hostname along with verifying the CA.
Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field in server certificates
The SAN field contains the hostname (DNS name of the instance) only for
instances enabled with Private Service Connect .
Hostname can be used for server identity
verification. If you are connecting to a Cloud SQL instance using the DNS name as the hostname, then you need to set up DNS resolution.
The SAN field contains the hostname (DNS name of the instance) for all types of instances. Hostname can
be used for server identity verification.
If you are connecting to a Cloud SQL instance using the DNS name as the hostname, then you need to set up DNS resolution.
The SAN field contains the hostname (DNS name of the instance) for all types of instances. Hostname can
be used for server identity verification.

* For the customer-managed CA option,
the default validity period of a CA certificate in CA Service
is 10 years. You have the option to configure a different validity period for your CA certificates.
A shorter validity period for the CA might require more frequent CA rotations and
a validity period shorter than one year might affect the validity period of your server certificates.
For more information, see Managing CA rotation .
** For the customer-managed CA option,
the default validity period of a server certificate
is one year. However, if you configure a validity period that is shorter than
one year for your CA certificate,
then your server certificate has a shorter validity period.
For more information about configuring the validity period of your CA certificate
upon creation, see CA certificate settings and
Create a root CA .
Per-instance CA hosted by Cloud SQL
The per-instance CA hierarchy is the default server CA mode configuration when you
create an instance using the gcloud CLI , Cloud SQL Admin API, or Terraform.
Cloud SQL creates a new self-signed server CA for each
instance when you create the instance.
To use this setting,
configure serverCaMode to GOOGLE_MANAGED_INTERNAL_CA when you create the instance.
You can either leave the serverCaMode
configuration setting unspecified using Cloud SQL Admin API or gcloud CLI ,
or select the Google internal Certificate Authority option in
the Google Cloud console.
You can't update the serverCaMode of an instance that uses a shared CA or
customer-managed CA hierarchy to use the per-instance CA hierarchy.
The following diagram shows the per-instance CA hierarchy.
Shared CAs hosted by CA Service
This server CA mode consists of a root CA and subordinate server CAs in
each region. The subordinate server CAs issue server certificates and
are shared across instances in the region. Cloud SQL handles the rotation
of the shared regional server CAs and provides publicly available links to download the
CA certificate bundles .
When you use shared CA mode, your database clients must trust both the
root CA and the subordinate CA that issues the server certificates for your
instance.
To trust both the root CA and the subordinate CA for your instance,
do one of the following options:
Download the global.pem bundle
to trust the root CA and all of its subordinate CAs.
Download the regional bundle
for the regional location of your instance to trust the root CA and subordinate CAs
for that region.
For example, if your instance is located in the asia-east1 region, then download
the asia-east1.pem bundle.
Download the server-ca.pem for your instance to trust the root CA and
the subordinate CA that issues the server certificate for your instance.
You can configure an instance to use a server CA hierarchy where the issuing
CAs are shared across the instances in the same region. To use this setting,
configure serverCaMode to GOOGLE_MANAGED_CAS_CA when you create or edit
the instance.
You can also select
Google Managed CAS Certificate Authority in the Google Cloud console.
The following diagram shows the shared CA hierarchy.
Customer-managed CAs
This server CA mode lets you set up your own CA hierarchy in
CA Service.
To use the customer-managed CA option
in Cloud SQL, you create a CA pool in the same region
as your Cloud SQL instances. Then you create at least one CA.
When you create the Cloud SQL instance, specify the ID of the
CA pool in the serverCaPool field and configure the serverCaMode field
with the CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CAS_CA value.
CA Service provides a CA from the CA pool and
uses that CA to issue the server certificate for the instance.
When you create CAs in CA Service, you can create
either a root CA or a subordinate CA depending on your use case.
For example, you might want to create a subordinate CA if you plan to
set up a root CA hierarchy or chain up to an external CA.
Select the customer-managed CA option
only if you want to manage your own CAs and certificates. For more information,
see Use a customer-managed CA .
How server certificate rotation works
Cloud SQL provides ways to
rotate your server certificate,
so the new certificate can be seamlessly swapped in before the old certificate
expires.
Instances using the shared CA or customer-managed CA hierarchy can enable
automatic server certificate rotation
to run during maintenance updates up to
180 days before expiry.
For instances that use the per-instance CA, shared CA, or customer-managed CA hierarchies, about
three months before the server certificate expires for a Cloud SQL
instance, the project owners receive an email from Cloud SQL, stating
that the certificate rotation process has begun for that instance.
The email provides the name of the instance, and says that Cloud SQL
has added a new server certificate to the project. The existing server certificate
continues to function normally. In effect, the
instance has two server certificates during this period.
The server certificate rotation command to use depends on whether you are using
a server certificate issued by a per-instance CA or a server certificate issued
by the shared CA or customer-managed CA.
Before the current server certificate expires, download the new server-ca.pem file,
which contains the certificate information for both the current and the new
server certificates. Update your SQL Server clients to use the new
file, by copying it to all of your SQL Server client host machines, replacing
the existing file.
After all of your SQL Server clients have been updated, send a
rotate command (for per-instance CA) or
rotate command (for shared CA or customer-managed CA)
to the Cloud SQL
instance to rotate to the new server certificate. After that is done, the
old server certificate is no longer recognized, and only the new server
certificate can be used.
SSL certificate expiration
For Cloud SQL instances that use per-instance CAs
( serverCaMode is set to GOOGLE_MANAGED_INTERNAL_CA ),
the SSL certificates come with an
expiration period of 10 years. Before these certificates
expire, perform server CA certificate rotation .
For instances that use shared CAs
( serverCaMode is set to GOOGLE_MANAGED_CAS_CA ),
the expiration period of the server certificates is 1 year.
Before expiration, perform a server certificate rotation or enable automatic server certificate rotation .
The root certificate authority
(CA) certificate has an expiration period of 25 years and the subordinate shared CA
certificate has an expiration period of 10 years.
Cloud SQL handles their rotation.
If you're using a customer-managed CA ( serverCaMode is set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CAS_CA ),
then you can perform CA certificate rotation by rotating the CAs in the
CA pool that you created. The expiration period of a CA is typically 10 years,
but you can configure a shorter validity period for your CA in CA Service.
To rotate the CAs, use the CA rotation process in CA Service.
For more information, see Managing CA rotation .
If a client is configured to verify the CA or verify the hostname in the server
certificate, then that client's connections to Cloud SQL instances with
expired server certificates will fail. To prevent disruption to client connections,
rotate the server certificate before the certificate expires.
Whether you use the per-instance CA, the shared CA, or the customer-managed CA
server mode, you can reset the SSL
configuration of your Cloud SQL instance at any time.
Limitations
This section covers limitations with SSL/TLS certificate configuration and
Cloud SQL.
Service connection limitations
If your instance uses the shared CA ( GOOGLE_MANAGED_CAS_CA )
or customer-managed CA ( CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CAS_CA ) option for its serverCaMode configuration, then the instance can't support connections from the following Google Cloud services:
App Engine standard environment
App Engine flexible environment
Cloud Run services that run in a first generation execution environment
