Perform point-in-time recovery (PITR)

MySQL
| PostgreSQL
| SQL Server
You can use point-in-time-recovery (PITR) to restore your primary Cloud SQL
instances whether the instance is live, or is deleted. PITR lets you restore
the instance to a specific point-in-time. For a deleted instance, you
can restore the instance to a specific point-in-time to a new or existing
instance.
Cloud SQL provides the following options to restore your instance
using PITR:
Perform a PITR on a live instance
Perform a PITR using the backup vault
Perform a PITR on a deleted instance
For performing a PITR on an unavailable or deleted instance, you'll need to
find the
latest and earliest recovery time .
Perform a PITR
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Open the more actions menu for the instance you
want to recover and click Create clone .
Optionally, on the Create a clone page, update the ID of the
new clone.
Select Clone from an earlier point in time .
Enter a PITR time.
Select All databases , or specify a database name.
If you specify a database name, only one may be selected.
By default, PITR is for all databases.
Click Create clone .
gcloud
Create a clone using PITR.
Replace the following:
SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME - Name of the instance you're
restoring from.
NEW_INSTANCE_NAME - Name for the clone.
TIMESTAMP - UTC timezone for the source instance in RFC
3339 format. For example, 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.
gcloud sql instances clone SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME \
NEW_INSTANCE_NAME \
--point-in-time ' TIMESTAMP '
Note: By default, point-in-time recovery is for all
databases. Optionally, you can specify up to one specific
database name as follows: --database_names 'DATABASE'

Perform a PITR using the backup vault
If your Cloud SQL instance is enabled to use
enhanced backups ,
then you can perform point-in-time-recovery for your instance using the
backup vault.
Note: If you're using Terraform or the Cloud SQL API to perform PITR
and your instance uses enhanced backups, then Cloud SQL uses the
PITR settings from the instance's associated backup plan.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Open the more actions menu for the instance you
want to recover and click Create clone .
Select Clone from an earlier point in time .
Enter a PITR time.
Click Create clone .
gcloud
To perform a PITR on an instance from the backup vault, you'll need to find the
data-source for the backup that is nearest to the time you want to perform
the PITR. To find the backup, see
List all the backups in the backup vault for an instance . Once you've identified the backup, run the following command to perform the PITR:
gcloud sql instances point - in - time - restore DATA_SOURCE TARGET_INSTANCE_NAME PITR_TIMESTAMP \
-- project = TARGET_PROJECT \
-- region = REGION
Replace the following:
DATA_SOURCE : the path of the data-source for the source instance.
that is closest to the PITR timestamp you want to recover to.
TARGET_INSTANCE_NAME : the name for the new instance that is created by the PITR operation.
PITR_TIMESTAMP : the UTC timestamp for the source
instance PITR log you want to restore your instance to, in
RFC 3339 format. For example, 2025-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.
TARGET_PROJECT : the project ID for the new instance.
REGION : the region of the target instance.
This field is required if the data source of source instance is located in a multi-region. The target instance region must be the same as the region of the source instance.
REST v1
To perform point-in-time recovery using a data source from the backup vault, use the
instances.pointInTimeRestore method with a POST request.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where you want to create the new instance.
DATASOURCE : the Backup and DR data source you want the service to use for the point-in-time restore operation.
PITR_TIMESTAMP : the UTC timestamp for the source instance PITR log you want to restore your instance to, in RFC 3339 format. For example, 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.
TARGET_INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance created by the PITR operation.
REGION : the region of the target instance. This field is required if the data source of source instance is located in a multi-region. The target instance region must be the same as the region of the source instance.

Perform a cross-project PITR
With enhanced backups, you can restore a Cloud SQL instance to a
project other than the one where either the source instance or backup vault is
located.
Cross-project PITR is supported only through the gcloud CLI and REST APIs.
To perform a cross-project PITR, do one of the following:
If you're using the gcloud CLI, set the --project flag to the
project where you want to create the target instance.
If you're using REST APIs, set the PROJECT_ID field to the project where
you want to create the target instance.
Perform PITR on a deleted instance
To use PITR to restore a deleted instance, you'll need:
the PITR timestamp ( timestamp ) you want to restore your instance to
the target instance name
the time the source instance was deleted ( source-instance-deletion-time )
You can use
PITR on a deleted instance using gcloud CLI or the Cloud SQL
API only. For more information, see
Restore a deleted instance using a PITR .
gcloud
Standard backup
Find your PITR window
To find your deleted instance's PITR window, get the
earliest and latest recovery time
for your instance. You can select anytime timestamp in this window to
perform a PITR.

The source-instance-deletion-time and log-retention-days for the
deleted instance are stored with the retained backups for your instance after
deletion. To find a list of all available backups for your deleted instance, see

Once you identify the backup you want to use, use the
gcloud sql backups describe
command to get the source-instance-deletion-time .
Restore using a PITR
To restore your deleted instance using a PITR, run the following command:
gcloud sql instances clone SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME \

that you want to restore.
NEW_INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the new instance.
PITR_TIMESTAMP : the UTC timestamp for the source
instance PITR log you want to restore your instance to, in
RFC 3339 format. For example,
2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.

Get the earliest and latest recovery time
For an available instance, you can perform a PITR to any timestamp in the
instance's PITR window. The PITR window starts a the earliest recovery time
and ends at the latest recovery time. If the
instance is unavailable and the instance logs are stored in Cloud Storage ,
or the instance was deleted and had
PITR retention enabled ,
then you can retrieve the earliest and latest recovery time, and perform the
PITR to any timestamp in that window.
In all cases, you can restore the instance to a different primary or secondary zone
by providing values for the preferred zones.
gcloud
Unavailable instance
To get the earliest and latest time to which you can recover a
Cloud SQL instance that's not available, run the following command:
gcloud sql instances get-latest-recovery-time INSTANCE_NAME
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance you want to
find the latest recovery time for.
Deleted instance
To get the earliest and latest time to which you can recover a
