This page provides best practices for getting the best performance,
durability, and availability from Cloud SQL.
If issues occur with your Cloud SQL instance, review
the following during troubleshooting:
Debugging connection issues
Known issues
Troubleshooting
Instance configuration and administration
Best practice
More information
Read and follow the
operational guidelines
to ensure that your instances are covered by the Cloud SQL SLA .
Configure a maintenance window for your primary instance to control
when disruptive updates can occur.
See
Maintenance window .
If you delete and recreate instances regularly, use a timestamp in
the instance ID to increase the likelihood that new instance IDs are
usable.
Don't start an administrative operation before the previous operation
has completed.
Cloud SQL instances won't accept new operation requests until
they have completed the previous operation. If you attempt to start
a new operation prematurely, the operation request fails. This includes
instance restarts.
The instance status in the Google Cloud console does not
reflect whether an operation is running. The green check mark denotes
only that the instance is in the RUNNABLE state. To see
whether an operation is running, go to the Operations tab and
check the status of the most recent operation.
Configure storage to accommodate critical database maintenance.
If the
enable automatic storage increases
instance setting is disabled or the automatic storage increase limit is enabled, ensure you have at least 20% available
space to accommodate any critical database maintenance operations
that Cloud SQL may perform.
To get alerted on available disk space falling below 20%, create a metrics-based alerting policy for the
disk utilization metric with an above threshold
position and a value of .8 . For more information,
see Create metrics-based alert policies .
Prevent over-utilization of your CPU.
You can view the percentage of available CPU that your instance is using
on the instance details page in the Google Cloud console. For more information,
see
Metrics . You can also
monitor your CPU usage and receive alerts at a specified threshold using
Create metric-threshold alerting policies .
To avoid over-utilization, you can increase the number of CPUs for
your instance. Changing CPUs requires an instance restart. If your instance
is already at the maximum number of CPUs, you must shard your database to multiple
instances.
Avoid memory exhaustion.
When looking for signs of memory exhaustion, you should primarily
use the usage metric.
To avoid out-of-memory errors, we recommend that this metric remains under
90%.
You can also use the total_usage
metric to observe the percentage of available memory that your Cloud SQL
instance is using, including memory used by the database container and
memory allocated by the operating system cache.
By observing the difference between the two metrics, you can
identify how much memory is used by processes versus how much
is used by the operating system cache. You can repurpose the memory in
this cache.
To predict out-of-memory issues, check both metrics and
interpret them together. If the metrics appear high, the instance
might be low in memory. This can be because of a custom configuration,
the instance being undersized for the workload, or a combination of
these factors.
Scale your Cloud SQL instance to increase the size of its memory.
Changing the instance's memory size requires an instance restart.
If your instance is already at the maximum memory size,
you must shard your database across multiple instances. To learn more about
monitoring both metrics in the Google Cloud console,
see Metrics .
Set SQL Server settings so that they work optimally for Cloud SQL.
See SQL Server settings .
Tune the instance optimally for test runs.
The following table lists configuration values suitable for test runs.
vCPU: 40
Memory: 262144 MB
MAXDOP: 8
Cost threshold for parallelism: 120
tempdb files: 8 . Pre-sized to prevent autogrowth.
User database files: Autogrow set in 64-128 MB. Presized
to prevent autogrowth.
Storage: >= 4TB for the best IOPS
Determine the capacity of the I/O subsystem before you deploy SQL Server.
Test a variety of I/O types and sizes. The size of the I/O issued to
the persistent disk storage coming from
SQL Server affects the IOPS and throughput. The SQL Server workload is
throttled when it reaches the IOPS limit or the throughput limit. The
storage type being used in Cloud SQL is persistent disk SSD, which is suitable
for high-performance enterprise-level workloads.
Customize the VM to maximize performance as follows:
A disk size of 4TB or greater provides more throughput and IOPS.
Higher vCPU provides more IOPS and throughput. When using higher
vCPU, monitor the DB waits for parallelism, which might also increase.
For optimal performance, issue I/O in parallel to achieve a higher
I/O queue depth.
Prevent index fragmentation and missing indexes.
Reorganize your index or set up a schedule to rebuild your index
depending on how often your data is changing. Also, set an appropriate
fill factor to reduce fragmentation. Monitor SQL Server for missing indexes
that might offer improved performance.
Update statistics regularly.
If statistics are outdated, SQL query optimizer might generate
suboptimal query plans.
Update statistics especially after large amounts of data were changed.
Use the query store to monitor and troubleshoot the SQL
Server that has suboptimal query plans.
Prevent database files from becoming unnecessarily large.
Set autogrow
in MBs rather than as a percentage, using increments
appropriate to the requirement. Also, proactively manage the
growth before autogrowth kicks in.
Additionally, ensure that the Cloud SQL Enable automatic storage increases feature is enabled so
Cloud SQL can add
storage space if the database and the instance run out of space.
Detect database integrity issues by running
DBCC CHECKDB
at least once a week.
DBCC CHECKDB checks the integrity of all the objects in a database.
By running DBCC CHECKDB weekly, you can ensure that your databases aren't corrupt.
DBCC CHECKDB is a resource-intensive operation that can impact your instance's performance.
Don't run DBCC CHECKDB on a production server.
We recommend that you use one of the following options instead of running DBCC CHECKDB on a production server:
Clone a database and run DBCC CHECKDB on the clone database.
Restore a backup to another instance and then run DBCC CHECKDB on the restored
instance's databases.
For more information about restoring an instance, see Restore an instance .
Use the following code snippets to run DBCC CHECKDB on a database:
(Recommended) Run DBCC CHECKDB with EXTENDED_LOGICAL_CHECKS .
This is a comprehensive but more resource-intensive check.
USE DATABASE_NAME
DBCC CHECKDB WITH EXTENDED_LOGICAL_CHECKS,
DATA_PURITY,NO_INFOMSGS, ALL_ERRORMSGS
Run DBCC CHECKDB with PHYSICAL_ONLY :
USE DATABASE_NAME
DBCC CHECKDB WITH PHYSICAL_ONLY,
NO_INFOMSGS, ALL_ERRORMSGS
Optimize performance
To keep your data safe and your applications running smoothly with
In-Memory OLTP
tables, consider applying the following best practices:
Best practice
More information
Adhere to
Microsoft Best Practices for memory-optimized tables
Regular Backups : make sure you have scheduled regular backups
for your databases. In the case of data corruption, this lets you
restore your data to its last known secure state.
Backup verification : since DBCC repair options aren't available
for memory-optimized tables, it's recommended you test the backup by
running periodic restores. If data integrity issues occur in a
memory-optimized table, you must restore from the last known secure
backup.
For more information about limitations, see
unsupported SQL Server Features for In-Memory OLTP.
Security
Best practice
More information
Prefer Private IP
Unless Public IP
access is required, prefer using
Private IP . This will
help minimize unauthorized network connections to your database.
Avoid 0.0.0.0/0 in Authorized Networks
Avoid including 0.0.0.0/0 in
Authorized Networks
as this permits access from the global internet without restriction.
Avoid excessively large Authorized Networks
Avoid using small CIDR prefixes in
Authorized Networks
as this permits access from a potentially excessive number of hosts.
We recommend a CIDR prefix no smaller than /16, and preferably greater
than /19.
Data architecture
Best practice
More information
Split your large instances into smaller instances, where possible.
When possible, using many smaller Cloud SQL instances is
better than one large instance. Managing a large, monolithic instance
presents challenges not posed by a group of smaller instances.
Don't use too many database tables.
Keep your instance's table count to fewer than 10,000. Too many database
tables can impact database upgrade time.
Database collation
Whether you're installing a new instance of SQL Server, restoring a
database backup, or connecting a server to client databases, it's important
to understand the locale requirements, sorting order, and case and accent
sensitivity of the data that you're working with.
When you select a collation for your server, database, column, or
expression, you're assigning certain characteristics to your data.
These characteristics affect the results of many operations in the
database. For example, when you construct a query by using ORDER BY ,
the sort order of your result set might depend on the collation that's
applied to the database or dictated in a COLLATE clause at the
expression level of the query. Read more about
database collations and unicode support .
Query design
For optimal database or query performance, make sure you are not using a
large number of tables within the same query (sixteen or more).
Query monitoring
Queries might degrade over time. It's important to monitor your
application and query performance over time.
One reason for such degradation is hash bailouts .
Recursive hash joins or hash bailouts cause reduced performance in a
server. If you see many hash warning events in a trace, update
statistics on the columns that are being joined. Read more on
hash bailouts .
Application implementation
Best practice
More information
Use good connection management practices, such as connection pooling and
exponential backoff.
Using these techniques improves your application's use of resources
and helps you stay within Cloud SQL
connection limits .
For more information and code samples, see
Managing database connections .
Test your application's response to maintenance updates, which can
happen at any time during the maintenance window.
Try self-service maintenance
to simulate a maintenance update. During maintenance, your instance
becomes unavailable for a brief period, and existing connections
are dropped. Testing maintenance rollouts gives you a better
understanding of how your application handles scheduled maintenance and
how quickly the system can recover.
Test your application's response to failovers, which can
happen at any time.
You can manually initiate a failover using the Google Cloud console,
the gcloud CLI , or the API. See
Initiating failover .
Avoid large transactions.
Keep transactions small and short. If a large database update is needed,
do it in several smaller transactions rather than one large transaction.
If you are using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, make sure you are using the most
up-to-date version.
See
Keeping the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy up-to-date .
Data import and export
Best practice
More information
Speed up imports for small instance sizes.
For small instances, you can temporarily
increase the CPU and RAM
of an instance to improve performance when importing large datasets.
If you are exporting data for import into Cloud SQL, be sure to
use the proper procedure.
See
Exporting data from an externally managed database server .
Backup and recovery
Best practice
More information
Protect your data with the appropriate Cloud SQL functionality.
Backups and exports are ways to provide data redundancy and
protection. They each protect against different scenarios and complement
each other in a robust data protection strategy.
Backups are lightweight; they provide a way to
restore the data on your instance to its state at the time you took
the backup. However, backups have some limitations. If you delete the
instance, the backups are also deleted. You can't back up a single
database or table. And if the region where the instance is located
is unavailable, you cannot restore the instance from that backup, even
in an available region.
Exports take longer to create, because an external file is created
in Cloud Storage that can be used to recreate your data. Exports
are unaffected if you delete the instance. In addition, you can export
only a single database or even table, depending on the export format
you choose.
When using the export backup feature on an Enterprise or Standard SQL
Server instance, avoid creating a GZ archive file because it tries to
compress a backup that's already natively compressed by SQL Server.
Protect your instance and backups from accidental deletion.
A Cloud SQL instance that you create in the Google Cloud console
or via Terraform enables accidental deletion prevention by default.
Use the export feature in Cloud SQL to export your data for additional
protection. Use Cloud Scheduler with the REST API to automate export
management. For more advanced scenarios, Cloud Scheduler with
Cloud Run functions for automation.
SQL Server settings
Some SQL Server settings are recommended for Cloud SQL. The following
topics describe some recommendations.
Global configuration settings
Setting
Recommendation
max worker threads
Retain the default value of 0. This setting defines the number of threads
available to SQL Server based on the number of CPUs. The value is
automatically calculated by the SQL Server engine at startup.
max server memory (mb)
This flag limits the amount of memory that Cloud SQL can
allocate for its internal pools.
We recommend you let Cloud SQL manage the value of this flag. If you
must manually manage this value, use the formula outlined later in this section.
If you don't set a value for this flag, then Cloud SQL manages the
value automatically, based on the size of the RAM for your instance.
If you don't set a value for the flag and you resize your instance, then Cloud SQL
adjusts the value of the flag automatically to meet our recommendations for
the new instance size. This resize operation also removes any manually set
value for this flag. This helps your database utilize resources more effectively
by helping prevent overallocation, reducing the likelihood of a crash due to
out-of-memory issues, and helping to avoid performance degradation for your
instance.
If you prefer to manage the value for this flag, then set it manually. As
a result, Cloud SQL deactivates automatic management. If you're
resizing your instance, then the manually entered value is discarded.
Resizing the instance reactivates automatic flag management. If, after the
resize, you want to manually control the flag value, you'll need to enter a
new value to reactivate manual control. Consider revisiting the value to
match the recommended values for a new size.
If you must manually manage the flag's value, we recommend using the following
formula to set the max server memory (mb)
database flag:
Reserve 1.4 GB of memory for the OS and agents.
If the RAM on the server is less than or equal to 16 GB, then reserve 1 GB of memory for each 4 GB of RAM.
If the RAM on the server is greater than 16 GB, then leave 4 GB of memory and reserve 1 GB of memory for each 8 GB of RAM that's greater than 16 GB.
For example, if the RAM for your instance is 104 GB (106496 MB), then reserve:
1.4 GB of memory for the OS and agents
4 GB of memory , because 104 GB is greater than 16 GB
11 GB of memory , because there's 88 GB of RAM that's greater than 16 GB (104-16=88), and 88 divided by 8 is 11
For this example, you must reserve 16.4 GB of memory . As a result, for the value of this flag, specify 89702 MB [(104-16.4) * 1024 = 89702].
Caution : If the value that you set for this flag is too low, then your instance might not start.

To monitor the memory usage for your instance, use the following metrics :
database/memory/usage
database/sqlserver/memory/buffer_cache_hit_ratio
database/sqlserver/memory/memory_grants_pending
database/sqlserver/memory/page_life_expectancy
For more information, see Monitor Cloud SQL instances .
Database settings to modify
For optimal performance of the SQL Server database, set the following
SQL Server settings
as suggested in the following table.
Setting
Recommendation
cost threshold for parallelism
This is the threshold at which the SQL optimizer executes a query
using parallelism. The default value of 5 can cause
too many queries to run in parallel, thereby increasing database
wait time on parallel threads. To reduce this type of contention,
increase the value.
The value is ignored when maxdop is set to 1 .
max degree of parallelism (MAXDOP)
To reduce database waits due to parallelism, adjust this value
based on specific recommendations
about the number of logical processors available. Measure
performance carefully if setting this option to 1.
For more information, see max degree of parallelism (MAXDOP) .
optimize for ad hoc workloads
Avoid having a large number of single-use plans in the plan cache.
To improve the efficiency of the plan cache for workloads that
contain many single use ad hoc batches, set this option to 1 .
tempdb
Pre-size tempdb so that it does not need to autogrow.
All files in tempdb should be equally sized and have
the same file growth set.
The database wait type for tempdb contention
appears as PAGELATCH_UP .
To reduce the contention, add more files.
If the number of processors is less than or equal to 8, use the
same number of files as logical processors. If the number of
processors is greater than 8, use 8 data files. If contention
continues, increase the number of files
by multiples of 4 until there is no further contention.
Depending on your workload, you might want to modify the following settings
as well.
Setting
Recommendation
Close Cursor on Commit Enabled
The default value is off , which means that cursors
are not closed automatically when you commit a transaction.
Default Cursor
This option controls the scope of a cursor used in T-SQL
code.
If you change this setting, evaluate the application code for any
adverse effects.
Page Verify
This option allows SQL Server to calculate a checksum for a
database page before it is written to disk and store the checksum
in the page header. When a page is read again, the checksum is
recomputed to verify the integrity of the page.
The recommended value is checksum .
Parameterization
The default value is simple . Simple parameterization
allows SQL Server to replace literal values in a query with
parameters. Microsoft provides guidelines about how to change this
value and use it with plan guides.
Database settings to retain
For optimal performance of the SQL Server database, retain the default values of
the following SQL Server settings .
Setting
Default value to be retained
Auto Close
False . This setting, when on, opens and closes connections
and flushes the procedure after each connect. This can cause performance
degradation in databases that are frequently accessed.
Auto Shrink
False . Turning it on can lead to database and index
fragmentation and other performance issues, some of which are discussed in
this SQL Server blog .
Date Correlation Optimization Enabled
False . Enabling it can let the optimizer find and optimize
relationships between dates across two related tables. Tracking this in SQL
Server comes with some performance overhead.
Legacy Cardinality Estimation
False . In some cases, SQL Server cannot accurately calculate
cardinalities when this setting is enabled.
Parameter Sniffing
ON . Parameter sniffing from database tables can help create
execution plans for reuse. If the tables have unevenly distributed
data, the resultant execution plans might lead to performance issues.
With such data, use other options from the Query Store rather than modify this
setting.
Query Optimizer Fixes
False . When enabled, it can affect the performance of the
SQL Server cardinality estimator. If you choose to enable it, test to
ensure that there is no query regression.
Auto Create Statistics
True . This option allows SQL Server to create single-column
statistics
that can improve cardinality estimates for query plans.
Auto Update Statistics
True . This option allows SQL Server to update out-of-date
statistics using a re-compilation threshold that is based on table
cardinality.
Auto Update Statistics Asynchronously
False . This option, when enabled, directs the SQL query
optimizer to use the stale statistics for the current query execution,
while updating the statistics asynchronously to benefit future workloads.
However, if you expect predictable response time for a frequently
executed query or if your application frequently experiences client
request timeouts while awaiting statistics updates, consider enabling this
option and disabling Auto Update Statistics .
Target Recovery Time (Seconds)
60 . This setting establishes an upper bound on the recovery
time for a database by flushing dirty pages more or less frequently to the
disk from the buffer pool. For highly transactional workloads, a lower value
for this setting, combined with the storage IOPS near the maximum value,
can contribute to a performance bottleneck.
Trace flag settings
Trace flags in SQL Server are used to set certain characteristics, alter
the behavior of SQL Server databases, or debug issues in SQL Server.
Some SQL Server trace flags are supported in Cloud SQL and can be set
using database flags . The
recommended settings are as follows.
Trace flag
Recommended
1204
Yes , except for workload-intensive servers that generate a
lot of deadlocks.
Returns the resources and types of locks
participating in a deadlock and also the command currently affected.
1222
Yes , except for workload-intensive servers that generate a
lot of deadlocks.
1224
No . This can result in more memory usage and cause memory
pressure on the database.
2528
No . Parallel checking of objects is the default and is
recommended. The degree of parallelism is automatically calculated by the
database engine.
3205
No . Tape drives for backups is a feature of Cloud SQL
for SQL Server.
3226
No , unless you need frequent backups, such as TLOG backups.
3625
No . Because the root account does not have system
administrator access, it might not be able to see all error messages.
4199
No . This affects the cardinality estimator and can lead to
query regression.
4616
No . This restriction lowers the security around application
roles. It needs to be validated based on application requirements.
