Package datastore provides a client for App Engine's datastore service.
Basic Operations
Entities are the unit of storage and are associated with a key. A key
consists of an optional parent key, a string application ID, a string kind
(also known as an entity type), and either a StringID or an IntID. A
StringID is also known as an entity name or key name.
It is valid to create a key with a zero StringID and a zero IntID; this is
called an incomplete key, and does not refer to any saved entity. Putting an
entity into the datastore under an incomplete key will cause a unique key
to be generated for that entity, with a non-zero IntID.
An entity's contents are a mapping from case-sensitive field names to values.
Valid value types are:
signed integers (int, int8, int16, int32 and int64),
bool,
string,
float32 and float64,
[]byte (up to 1 megabyte in length),
any type whose underlying type is one of the above predeclared types,
ByteString,
*Key,
time.Time (stored with microsecond precision),
appengine.BlobKey,
appengine.GeoPoint,
structs whose fields are all valid value types,
slices of any of the above.
Slices of structs are valid, as are structs that contain slices. However, if
one struct contains another, then at most one of those can be repeated. This
disqualifies recursively defined struct types: any struct T that (directly or
indirectly) contains a []T.
The Get and Put functions load and save an entity's contents. An entity's
contents are typically represented by a struct pointer.
Example code:
type Entity struct {
Value string
}
func handle ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) {
ctx := appengine . NewContext ( r )
k := datastore . NewKey ( ctx , "Entity" , "stringID" , 0 , nil )
e := new ( Entity )
if err := datastore . Get ( ctx , k , e ); err != nil {
http . Error ( w , err . Error (), 500 )
return
}
old := e . Value
e . Value = r . URL . Path
if _ , err := datastore . Put ( ctx , k , e ); err != nil {
http . Error ( w , err . Error (), 500 )
return
}
w . Header (). Set ( "Content-Type" , "text/plain; charset=utf-8" )
fmt . Fprintf ( w , "old=%q\nnew=%q\n" , old , e . Value )
}
GetMulti, PutMulti and DeleteMulti are batch versions of the Get, Put and
Delete functions. They take a []*Key instead of a *Key, and may return an
appengine.MultiError when encountering partial failure.
Properties
An entity's contents can be represented by a variety of types. These are
typically struct pointers, but can also be any type that implements the
PropertyLoadSaver interface. If using a struct pointer, you do not have to
explicitly implement the PropertyLoadSaver interface; the datastore will
automatically convert via reflection. If a struct pointer does implement that
interface then those methods will be used in preference to the default
behavior for struct pointers. Struct pointers are more strongly typed and are
easier to use; PropertyLoadSavers are more flexible.
The actual types passed do not have to match between Get and Put calls or even
across different calls to datastore. It is valid to put a *PropertyList and
get that same entity as a *myStruct, or put a *myStruct0 and get a *myStruct1.
Conceptually, any entity is saved as a sequence of properties, and is loaded
into the destination value on a property-by-property basis. When loading into
a struct pointer, an entity that cannot be completely represented (such as a
missing field) will result in an ErrFieldMismatch error but it is up to the
caller whether this error is fatal, recoverable or ignorable.
By default, for struct pointers, all properties are potentially indexed, and
the property name is the same as the field name (and hence must start with an
upper case letter).
Fields may have a datastore:&quot;name,options&quot; tag. The tag name is the
property name, which must be one or more valid Go identifiers joined by ".",
but may start with a lower case letter. An empty tag name means to just use the
field name. A "-" tag name means that the datastore will ignore that field.
The only valid options are "omitempty" and "noindex".
If the options include "omitempty" and the value of the field is empty, then the field will be omitted on Save.
The empty values are false, 0, any nil interface value, and any array, slice, map, or string of length zero.
Struct field values will never be empty.
If options include "noindex" then the field will not be indexed. All fields are indexed
by default. Strings or byte slices longer than 1500 bytes cannot be indexed;
fields used to store long strings and byte slices must be tagged with "noindex"
or they will cause Put operations to fail.
To use multiple options together, separate them by a comma.
The order does not matter.
If the options is "" then the comma may be omitted.
Example code:
// A and B are renamed to a and b.
// A, C and J are not indexed.
// D's tag is equivalent to having no tag at all (E).
// I is ignored entirely by the datastore.
// J has tag information for both the datastore and json packages.
type TaggedStruct struct {
A int `datastore:"a,noindex"`
B int `datastore:"b"`
C int `datastore:",noindex"`
D int `datastore:""`
E int
I int `datastore:"-"`
J int `datastore:",noindex" json:"j"`
}
Structured Properties
If the struct pointed to contains other structs, then the nested or embedded
structs are flattened. For example, given these definitions:
type Inner1 struct {
W int32
X string
}
type Inner2 struct {
Y float64
}
type Inner3 struct {
Z bool
}
type Outer struct {
A int16
I [] Inner1
J Inner2
Inner3
}
then an Outer's properties would be equivalent to those of:
type OuterEquivalent struct {
A int16
IDotW [] int32 `datastore:"I.W"`
IDotX [] string `datastore:"I.X"`
JDotY float64 `datastore:"J.Y"`
Z bool
}
If Outer's embedded Inner3 field was tagged as datastore:&quot;Foo&quot; then the
equivalent field would instead be: FooDotZ bool datastore:&quot;Foo.Z&quot; .
If an outer struct is tagged "noindex" then all of its implicit flattened
fields are effectively "noindex".
The PropertyLoadSaver Interface
An entity's contents can also be represented by any type that implements the
PropertyLoadSaver interface. This type may be a struct pointer, but it does
not have to be. The datastore package will call Load when getting the entity's
contents, and Save when putting the entity's contents.
Possible uses include deriving non-stored fields, verifying fields, or indexing
a field only if its value is positive.
Example code:
type CustomPropsExample struct {
I , J int
// Sum is not stored, but should always be equal to I + J.
Sum int `datastore:"-"`
}
func ( x * CustomPropsExample ) Load ( ps [] datastore . Property ) error {
// Load I and J as usual.
if err := datastore . LoadStruct ( x , ps ); err != nil {
return err
}
// Derive the Sum field.
x . Sum = x . I + x . J
return nil
}
func ( x * CustomPropsExample ) Save () ([] datastore . Property , error ) {
// Validate the Sum field.
if x . Sum != x . I + x . J {
return nil , errors . New ( "CustomPropsExample has inconsistent sum" )
}
// Save I and J as usual. The code below is equivalent to calling
// "return datastore.SaveStruct(x)", but is done manually for
// demonstration purposes.
return [] datastore . Property {
{
Name : "I" ,
Value : int64 ( x . I ),
},
{
Name : "J" ,
Value : int64 ( x . J ),
},
}, nil
}
The *PropertyList type implements PropertyLoadSaver, and can therefore hold an
arbitrary entity's contents.
Queries
Queries retrieve entities based on their properties or key's ancestry. Running
a query yields an iterator of results: either keys or (key, entity) pairs.
Queries are re-usable and it is safe to call Query.Run from concurrent
goroutines. Iterators are not safe for concurrent use.
Queries are immutable, and are either created by calling NewQuery, or derived
from an existing query by calling a method like Filter or Order that returns a
new query value. A query is typically constructed by calling NewQuery followed
by a chain of zero or more such methods. These methods are:
Ancestor and Filter constrain the entities returned by running a query.
Order affects the order in which they are returned.
Project constrains the fields returned.
Distinct de-duplicates projected entities.
KeysOnly makes the iterator return only keys, not (key, entity) pairs.
Start, End, Offset and Limit define which sub-sequence of matching entities
to return. Start and End take cursors, Offset and Limit take integers. Start
and Offset affect the first result, End and Limit affect the last result.
If both Start and Offset are set, then the offset is relative to Start.
If both End and Limit are set, then the earliest constraint wins. Limit is
relative to Start+Offset, not relative to End. As a special case, a
negative limit means unlimited.
Example code:
type Widget struct {
Description string
Price int
}
func handle ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) {
ctx := appengine . NewContext ( r )
q := datastore . NewQuery ( "Widget" ).
Filter ( "Price <" , 1000 ).
Order ( "-Price" )
b := new ( bytes . Buffer )
for t := q . Run ( ctx ); ; {
var x Widget
key , err := t . Next ( & x )
if err == datastore . Done {
break
}
if err != nil {
serveError ( ctx , w , err )
return
}
fmt . Fprintf ( b , "Key=%v\nWidget=%#v\n\n" , key , x )
}
w . Header (). Set ( "Content-Type" , "text/plain; charset=utf-8" )
io . Copy ( w , b )
}
Transactions
RunInTransaction runs a function in a transaction.
Example code:
type Counter struct {
Count int
}
func inc ( ctx context . Context , key * datastore . Key ) ( int , error ) {
var x Counter
if err := datastore . Get ( ctx , key , & x ); err != nil && err != datastore . ErrNoSuchEntity {
return 0 , err
}
x . Count ++
if _ , err := datastore . Put ( ctx , key , & x ); err != nil {
return 0 , err
}
return x . Count , nil
}
func handle ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) {
ctx := appengine . NewContext ( r )
var count int
err := datastore . RunInTransaction ( ctx , func ( ctx context . Context ) error {
var err1 error
count , err1 = inc ( ctx , datastore . NewKey ( ctx , "Counter" , "singleton" , 0 , nil ))
return err1
}, nil )
if err != nil {
serveError ( ctx , w , err )
return
}
w . Header (). Set ( "Content-Type" , "text/plain; charset=utf-8" )
fmt . Fprintf ( w , "Count=%d" , count )
}
Metadata
The datastore package provides access to some of App Engine's datastore
metadata. This metadata includes information about the entity groups,
namespaces, entity kinds, and properties in the datastore, as well as the
property representations for each property.
Example code:
func handle ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) {
// Print all the kinds in the datastore, with all the indexed
// properties (and their representations) for each.
ctx := appengine . NewContext ( r )
kinds , err := datastore . Kinds ( ctx )
if err != nil {
serveError ( ctx , w , err )
return
}
w . Header (). Set ( "Content-Type" , "text/plain; charset=utf-8" )
for _ , kind := range kinds {
fmt . Fprintf ( w , "%s:\n" , kind )
props , err := datastore . KindProperties ( ctx , kind )
if err != nil {
fmt . Fprintln ( w , "\t(unable to retrieve properties)" )
continue
}
for p , rep := range props {
fmt . Fprintf ( w , "\t-%s (%s)\n" , p , strings . Join ( rep , ", " ))
}
}
}
Variables
ErrInvalidEntityType, ErrInvalidKey, ErrNoSuchEntity
var (
// ErrInvalidEntityType is returned when functions like Get or Next are
// passed a dst or src argument of invalid type.
ErrInvalidEntityType = errors . New ( "datastore: invalid entity type" )
// ErrInvalidKey is returned when an invalid key is presented.
ErrInvalidKey = errors . New ( "datastore: invalid key" )
// ErrNoSuchEntity is returned when no entity was found for a given key.
ErrNoSuchEntity = errors . New ( "datastore: no such entity" )
)
Done
var Done = errors . New ( "datastore: query has no more results" )
Done is returned when a query iteration has completed.
ErrConcurrentTransaction
var ErrConcurrentTransaction = errors . New ( "datastore: concurrent transaction" )
ErrConcurrentTransaction is returned when a transaction is rolled back due
to a conflict with a concurrent transaction.
Functions
func AllocateIDRange
func AllocateIDRange ( c context . Context , kind string , parent * Key , start , end int64 ) ( err error )
AllocateIDRange allocates a range of IDs with specific endpoints.
The range is inclusive at both the low and high end. Once these IDs have been
allocated, you can manually assign them to newly created entities.
The Datastore's automatic ID allocator never assigns a key that has already
been allocated (either through automatic ID allocation or through an explicit
AllocateIDs call). As a result, entities written to the given key range will
never be overwritten. However, writing entities with manually assigned keys in
this range may overwrite existing entities (or new entities written by a separate
request), depending on the error returned.
Use this only if you have an existing numeric ID range that you want to reserve
(for example, bulk loading entities that already have IDs). If you don't care
about which IDs you receive, use AllocateIDs instead.
AllocateIDRange returns nil if the range is successfully allocated. If one or more
entities with an ID in the given range already exist, it returns a KeyRangeCollisionError.
If the Datastore has already cached IDs in this range (e.g. from a previous call to
AllocateIDRange), it returns a KeyRangeContentionError. Errors of other types indicate
problems with arguments or an error returned directly from the Datastore.
func AllocateIDs
func AllocateIDs ( c context . Context , kind string , parent * Key , n int ) ( low , high int64 , err error )
AllocateIDs returns a range of n integer IDs with the given kind and parent
combination. kind cannot be empty; parent may be nil. The IDs in the range
returned will not be used by the datastore's automatic ID sequence generator
and may be used with NewKey without conflict.
The range is inclusive at the low end and exclusive at the high end. In
other words, valid intIDs x satisfy low <= x && x < high.
If no error is returned, low + n == high.
func Delete
func Delete ( c context . Context , key * Key ) error
Delete deletes the entity for the given key.
func DeleteMulti
func DeleteMulti ( c context . Context , key [] * Key ) error
DeleteMulti is a batch version of Delete.
func EnableKeyConversion
func EnableKeyConversion ( ctx context . Context )
EnableKeyConversion enables encoded key compatibility with the Cloud
Datastore client library (cloud.google.com/go/datastore). Encoded keys
generated by the Cloud Datastore client library will be decoded into App
Engine datastore keys.
The context provided must be an App Engine context if running in App Engine
first generation runtime. This can be called in the /_ah/start handler. It is
safe to call multiple times, and is cheap to call, so can also be inserted as
middleware.
Enabling key compatibility does not affect the encoding format used by
Key.Encode, it only expands the type of keys that are able to be decoded with
DecodeKey.
func Get
func Get ( c context . Context , key * Key , dst interface {}) error
Get loads the entity stored for k into dst, which must be a struct pointer
or implement PropertyLoadSaver. If there is no such entity for the key, Get
returns ErrNoSuchEntity.
The values of dst's unmatched struct fields are not modified, and matching
slice-typed fields are not reset before appending to them. In particular, it
is recommended to pass a pointer to a zero valued struct on each Get call.
ErrFieldMismatch is returned when a field is to be loaded into a different
type than the one it was stored from, or when a field is missing or
unexported in the destination struct. ErrFieldMismatch is only returned if
dst is a struct pointer.
func GetMulti
func GetMulti ( c context . Context , key [] * Key , dst interface {}) error
GetMulti is a batch version of Get.
dst must be a []S, []*S, []I or []P, for some struct type S, some interface
type I, or some non-interface non-pointer type P such that P or *P
implements PropertyLoadSaver. If an []I, each element must be a valid dst
for Get: it must be a struct pointer or implement PropertyLoadSaver.
As a special case, PropertyList is an invalid type for dst, even though a
PropertyList is a slice of structs. It is treated as invalid to avoid being
mistakenly passed when []PropertyList was intended.
func KindProperties
func KindProperties ( ctx context . Context , kind string ) ( map [ string ][] string , error )
KindProperties returns all the indexed properties for the given kind.
The properties are returned as a map of property names to a slice of the
representation types. The representation types for the supported Go property
types are:
"INT64": signed integers and time.Time
"DOUBLE": float32 and float64
"BOOLEAN": bool
"STRING": string, []byte and ByteString
"POINT": appengine.GeoPoint
"REFERENCE": *Key
"USER": (not used in the Go runtime)
func Kinds
func Kinds ( ctx context . Context ) ([] string , error )
Kinds returns the names of all the kinds in the current namespace.
func LoadStruct
func LoadStruct ( dst interface {}, p [] Property ) error
LoadStruct loads the properties from p to dst.
dst must be a struct pointer.
func Namespaces
func Namespaces ( ctx context . Context ) ([] string , error )
Namespaces returns all the datastore namespaces.
func RunInTransaction
func RunInTransaction ( c context . Context , f func ( tc context . Context ) error , opts * TransactionOptions ) error
RunInTransaction runs f in a transaction. It calls f with a transaction
context tc that f should use for all App Engine operations.
If f returns nil, RunInTransaction attempts to commit the transaction,
returning nil if it succeeds. If the commit fails due to a conflicting
transaction, RunInTransaction retries f, each time with a new transaction
context. It gives up and returns ErrConcurrentTransaction after three
failed attempts. The number of attempts can be configured by specifying
TransactionOptions.Attempts.
If f returns non-nil, then any datastore changes will not be applied and
RunInTransaction returns that same error. The function f is not retried.
Note that when f returns, the transaction is not yet committed. Calling code
must be careful not to assume that any of f's changes have been committed
until RunInTransaction returns nil.
Since f may be called multiple times, f should usually be idempotent.
datastore.Get is not idempotent when unmarshaling slice fields.
Nested transactions are not supported; c may not be a transaction context.
ByteString
type ByteString [] byte
ByteString is a short byte slice (up to 1500 bytes) that can be indexed.
Cursor
type Cursor struct {
// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
Cursor is an iterator's position. It can be converted to and from an opaque
string. A cursor can be used from different HTTP requests, but only with a
query with the same kind, ancestor, filter and order constraints.
func DecodeCursor
func DecodeCursor ( s string ) ( Cursor , error )
DecodeCursor decodes a cursor from its base-64 string representation.
func (Cursor) String
func ( c Cursor ) String () string
String returns a base-64 string representation of a cursor.
Entity
type Entity struct {
Key * Key
Properties [] Property
}
An Entity is the value type for a nested struct.
This type is only used for a Property's Value.
ErrFieldMismatch
type ErrFieldMismatch struct {
StructType reflect . Type
FieldName string
Reason string
}
ErrFieldMismatch is returned when a field is to be loaded into a different
type than the one it was stored from, or when a field is missing or
unexported in the destination struct.
StructType is the type of the struct pointed to by the destination argument
passed to Get or to Iterator.Next.
func (*ErrFieldMismatch) Error
func ( e * ErrFieldMismatch ) Error () string

type Iterator struct {
// contains filtered or unexported fields
}

Cursor returns a cursor for the iterator's current location.
func (*Iterator) Next
func ( t * Iterator ) Next ( dst interface {}) ( * Key , error )
Next returns the key of the next result. When there are no more results,
Done is returned as the error.
If the query is not keys only and dst is non-nil, it also loads the entity
stored for that key into the struct pointer or PropertyLoadSaver dst, with
the same semantics and possible errors as for the Get function.
Key
type Key struct {
// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
Key represents the datastore key for a stored entity, and is immutable.
func DecodeKey
func DecodeKey ( encoded string ) ( * Key , error )

func NewKey ( c context . Context , kind , stringID string , intID int64 , parent * Key ) * Key
NewKey creates a new key.
kind cannot be empty.
Either one or both of stringID and intID must be zero. If both are zero,
the key returned is incomplete.
parent must either be a complete key or nil.
func Put
func Put ( c context . Context , key * Key , src interface {}) ( * Key , error )
Put saves the entity src into the datastore with key k. src must be a struct
pointer or implement PropertyLoadSaver; if a struct pointer then any
unexported fields of that struct will be skipped. If k is an incomplete key,
the returned key will be a unique key generated by the datastore.
func PutMulti
func PutMulti ( c context . Context , key [] * Key , src interface {}) ([] * Key , error )
PutMulti is a batch version of Put.
src must satisfy the same conditions as the dst argument to GetMulti.

AppID returns the key's application ID.
func (*Key) Encode
func ( k * Key ) Encode () string
Encode returns an opaque representation of the key
suitable for use in HTML and URLs.
This is compatible with the Python and Java runtimes.

String returns a string representation of the key.
func (*Key) StringID
func ( k * Key ) StringID () string
StringID returns the key's string ID (also known as an entity name or key
name), which may be "".

// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
func (*KeyRangeCollisionError) Error
func ( e * KeyRangeCollisionError ) Error () string
KeyRangeContentionError
type KeyRangeContentionError struct {
// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
func (*KeyRangeContentionError) Error
func ( e * KeyRangeContentionError ) Error () string
Property
type Property struct {
// Name is the property name.
Name string
// Value is the property value. The valid types are:
// - int64
// - bool
// - string
// - float64
// - ByteString
// - *Key
// - time.Time
// - appengine.BlobKey
// - appengine.GeoPoint
// - []byte (up to 1 megabyte in length)
// - *Entity (representing a nested struct)
// This set is smaller than the set of valid struct field types that the
// datastore can load and save. A Property Value cannot be a slice (apart
// from []byte); use multiple Properties instead. Also, a Value's type
// must be explicitly on the list above; it is not sufficient for the
// underlying type to be on that list. For example, a Value of "type
// myInt64 int64" is invalid. Smaller-width integers and floats are also
// invalid. Again, this is more restrictive than the set of valid struct
// field types.
//
// A Value will have an opaque type when loading entities from an index,
// such as via a projection query. Load entities into a struct instead
// of a PropertyLoadSaver when using a projection query.
//
// A Value may also be the nil interface value; this is equivalent to
// Python's None but not directly representable by a Go struct. Loading
// a nil-valued property into a struct will set that field to the zero
// value.
Value interface {}
// NoIndex is whether the datastore cannot index this property.
NoIndex bool
// Multiple is whether the entity can have multiple properties with
// the same name. Even if a particular instance only has one property with
// a certain name, Multiple should be true if a struct would best represent
// it as a field of type []T instead of type T.
Multiple bool
}
Property is a name/value pair plus some metadata. A datastore entity's
contents are loaded and saved as a sequence of Properties. An entity can
have multiple Properties with the same name, provided that p.Multiple is
true on all of that entity's Properties with that name.
func SaveStruct
func SaveStruct ( src interface {}) ([] Property , error )
SaveStruct returns the properties from src as a slice of Properties.
src must be a struct pointer.
PropertyList
type PropertyList [] Property
PropertyList converts a []Property to implement PropertyLoadSaver.
func (*PropertyList) Load
func ( l * PropertyList ) Load ( p [] Property ) error
Load loads all of the provided properties into l.
It does not first reset *l to an empty slice.
func (*PropertyList) Save
func ( l * PropertyList ) Save () ([] Property , error )
Save saves all of l's properties as a slice or Properties.
PropertyLoadSaver
type PropertyLoadSaver interface {
Load ([] Property ) error
Save () ([] Property , error )
}
PropertyLoadSaver can be converted from and to a slice of Properties.
Query
type Query struct {
// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
Query represents a datastore query.
func NewQuery
func NewQuery ( kind string ) * Query
NewQuery creates a new Query for a specific entity kind.
An empty kind means to return all entities, including entities created and
managed by other App Engine features, and is called a kindless query.
Kindless queries cannot include filters or sort orders on property values.
func (*Query) Ancestor
func ( q * Query ) Ancestor ( ancestor * Key ) * Query
Ancestor returns a derivative query with an ancestor filter.
The ancestor should not be nil.
func (*Query) BatchSize
func ( q * Query ) BatchSize ( size int ) * Query
BatchSize returns a derivative query to fetch the supplied number of results
at once. This value should be greater than zero, and equal to or less than
the Limit.
func (*Query) Count
func ( q * Query ) Count ( c context . Context ) ( int , error )
Count returns the number of results for the query.
The running time and number of API calls made by Count scale linearly with
the sum of the query's offset and limit. Unless the result count is
expected to be small, it is best to specify a limit; otherwise Count will
continue until it finishes counting or the provided context expires.
func (*Query) Distinct
func ( q * Query ) Distinct () * Query
Distinct returns a derivative query that yields de-duplicated entities with
respect to the set of projected fields. It is only used for projection
queries. Distinct cannot be used with DistinctOn.
func (*Query) DistinctOn
func ( q * Query ) DistinctOn ( fieldNames string ) * Query
DistinctOn returns a derivative query that yields de-duplicated entities with
respect to the set of the specified fields. It is only used for projection
queries. The field list should be a subset of the projected field list.
DistinctOn cannot be used with Distinct.
func (*Query) End
func ( q * Query ) End ( c Cursor ) * Query
End returns a derivative query with the given end point.
func (*Query) EventualConsistency
func ( q * Query ) EventualConsistency () * Query
EventualConsistency returns a derivative query that returns eventually
consistent results.
It only has an effect on ancestor queries.
func (*Query) Filter
func ( q * Query ) Filter ( filterStr string , value interface {}) * Query
Filter returns a derivative query with a field-based filter.
The filterStr argument must be a field name followed by optional space,
followed by an operator, one of ">", "<", ">=", "<=", or "=".
Fields are compared against the provided value using the operator.
Multiple filters are AND'ed together.
func (*Query) GetAll
func ( q * Query ) GetAll ( c context . Context , dst interface {}) ([] * Key , error )
GetAll runs the query in the given context and returns all keys that match
that query, as well as appending the values to dst.
dst must have type []S or *[] S or *[]P, for some struct type S or some non-
interface, non-pointer type P such that P or *P implements PropertyLoadSaver.
As a special case, *PropertyList is an invalid type for dst, even though a
PropertyList is a slice of structs. It is treated as invalid to avoid being
mistakenly passed when *[]PropertyList was intended.
The keys returned by GetAll will be in a 1-1 correspondence with the entities
added to dst.
If q is a “keys-only” query, GetAll ignores dst and only returns the keys.
The running time and number of API calls made by GetAll scale linearly with
the sum of the query's offset and limit. Unless the result count is
expected to be small, it is best to specify a limit; otherwise GetAll will
continue until it finishes collecting results or the provided context
expires.
func (*Query) KeysOnly
func ( q * Query ) KeysOnly () * Query
KeysOnly returns a derivative query that yields only keys, not keys and
entities. It cannot be used with projection queries.
func (*Query) Limit
func ( q * Query ) Limit ( limit int ) * Query
Limit returns a derivative query that has a limit on the number of results
returned. A negative value means unlimited.
func (*Query) Offset
func ( q * Query ) Offset ( offset int ) * Query
Offset returns a derivative query that has an offset of how many keys to
skip over before returning results. A negative value is invalid.
func (*Query) Order
func ( q * Query ) Order ( fieldName string ) * Query
Order returns a derivative query with a field-based sort order. Orders are
applied in the order they are added. The default order is ascending; to sort
in descending order prefix the fieldName with a minus sign (-).
func (*Query) Project
func ( q * Query ) Project ( fieldNames string ) * Query
Project returns a derivative query that yields only the given fields. It
cannot be used with KeysOnly.
func (*Query) Run
func ( q * Query ) Run ( c context . Context ) * Iterator
Run runs the query in the given context.
func (*Query) Start
func ( q * Query ) Start ( c Cursor ) * Query
Start returns a derivative query with the given start point.
TransactionOptions
type TransactionOptions struct {
// XG is whether the transaction can cross multiple entity groups. In
// comparison, a single group transaction is one where all datastore keys
// used have the same root key. Note that cross group transactions do not
// have the same behavior as single group transactions. In particular, it
// is much more likely to see partially applied transactions in different
// entity groups, in global queries.
// It is valid to set XG to true even if the transaction is within a
// single entity group.
XG bool
// Attempts controls the number of retries to perform when commits fail
// due to a conflicting transaction. If omitted, it defaults to 3.
Attempts int
// ReadOnly controls whether the transaction is a read only transaction.
// Read only transactions are potentially more efficient.
ReadOnly bool
}
TransactionOptions are the options for running a transaction.
