Region ID
The REGION_ID is an abbreviated code that Google assigns
based on the region you select when you create your app. The code does not
correspond to a country or province, even though some region IDs may appear
similar to commonly used country and province codes. For apps created after
February 2020, REGION_ID .r is included in
App Engine URLs. For existing apps created before this date, the
region ID is optional in the URL.

This document describes how your App Engine application receives requests and
sends responses. For more details, see the
Request Headers and Responses reference .
If your application uses services ,
you can address requests to a specific service or a specific version of that
service. For more information about service addressability, see
How Requests are
Routed .
Handling requests
Your application is responsible for starting a webserver and handling requests.
You can use any web framework that is available for your development language.
App Engine runs multiple instances of your application, and each
instance has its own web server for handling requests. Any request can be routed
to any instance, so consecutive requests from the same user are not necessarily
sent to the same instance. An instance can handle multiple requests
concurrently. The number of instances can be adjusted automatically as traffic
changes. You can also change the number of concurrent requests an instance can handle
by setting the max_concurrent_requests element in your
app.yaml file ,
or appengine-web.xml file
file if using the App Engine legacy bundled services.
The following example is a Python script that responds to any HTTP request with the
message 'Hello World!'

app = Flask ( __name__ )
@app . route ( "/" )
def hello ():
"""Return a friendly HTTP greeting.

# Engine, a webserver process such as Gunicorn will serve the app. You
# can configure startup instructions by adding `entrypoint` to app.yaml.
app . run ( host = "127.0.0.1" , port = 8080 , debug = True )
Quotas and limits
App Engine automatically allocates resources to your application as
traffic increases. However, this is bound by the following restrictions:
App Engine reserves automatic scaling capacity for applications with
low latency, where the application responds to requests in less than one
second.
Applications that are heavily CPU-bound may also incur some additional latency
in order to efficiently share resources with other applications on the same
servers. Requests for static files are exempt from these latency limits.
Each incoming request to the application counts toward the Requests limit.
Data sent in response to a request counts toward the
Outgoing Bandwidth (billable) limit.
Both HTTP and HTTPS (secure) requests count toward the Requests , Incoming
Bandwidth (billable) , and Outgoing Bandwidth (billable) limits. The
Google Cloud console
Quota Details page
also reports Secure Requests , Secure Incoming Bandwidth , and
Secure Outgoing Bandwidth as separate values for informational purposes.
Only HTTPS requests count toward these values. For more information, see the
Quotas page.
The following limits apply specifically to the use of request handlers:

Pending request timeout
10 seconds
Maximum size of a single request header field
8 kilobytes for second-generation runtimes in the standard environment. Requests to these runtimes with header fields exceeding 8 kilobytes will return HTTP 400 errors.
Request limits
All HTTP/2 requests will be translated into HTTP/1.1 requests when forwarded to
the application server.
Response limits
Dynamic responses are limited to 32 MB. If a script handler generates a response
larger than this limit, the server sends back an empty response with a 500
Internal Server Error status code. This limitation doesn't apply to responses
that serve data from Cloud Storage
or the legacy Blobstore API if it is available in your runtime.
The response header limit is 8 KB for second-generation runtimes .
Response headers that exceed this limit will return HTTP 502 errors, with
logs showing upstream sent too big header while reading response header from upstream .
Request headers
An incoming HTTP request includes the HTTP headers sent by the client. For
security purposes, some headers are sanitized or amended by intermediate proxies
before they reach the application.
For more information, see the Request headers reference .
Handling request timeouts
App Engine is optimized for applications with short-lived requests,
typically those that take a few hundred milliseconds. An efficient app responds
quickly for the majority of requests. An app that doesn't respond quickly, won't scale well
with App Engine's infrastructure. To ensure this level of performance,
there is a system-imposed maximum request
timeout that every app must respond by.
If your app exceeds this deadline, App Engine interrupts
the request handler.
Responses
App Engine calls the handler script with a Request and waits for the
script to return; all data written to the standard output stream is sent as the
HTTP response.
There are size limits that apply to the response you
generate, and the response may be modified before it is returned to the client.
For more information, see the Request responses
reference .
Streaming Responses
App Engine doesn't support streaming responses where data is sent in
incremental chunks to the client while a request is being processed. All data
from your code is collected as described above and sent as a single HTTP
response.
Response compression
For responses that are returned by your code, App Engine compresses
data in the response if both of the following conditions are true:
The request contains the Accept-Encoding header that includes gzip as
a value.
The response contains text-based data such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
For responses that are returned by an App Engine
static file or directory
handler ,
response data is compressed if all of the following conditions are true:
The request includes Accept-Encoding with gzip as one of its values.
The client is capable of receiving the response data in a compressed format.
The Google Front End (GFE) maintains a list of clients that are known to have
problems with compressed responses. These clients won't receive compressed
data from static handlers in your app, even if the request headers contain
Accept-Encoding: gzip .
The response contains text-based data such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
Note the following:
A client can force text-based content types to be compressed by setting both
of the Accept-Encoding and User-Agent request headers to gzip .
If a request doesn't specify gzip in the Accept-Encoding header,
App Engine won't compress the response data.
The Google Front End caches responses from App Engine static file and
directory handlers. Depending on a variety of factors, such as which type of
response data is cached first, which Vary headers you have specified in the
response, and which headers are included in the request, a client could request
compressed data but receive uncompressed data, and the other way around. For
more information, see Response caching .
Response caching
The Google Front End, and potentially the user's browser and other intermediate
caching proxy servers, will cache your app's responses as instructed by
standard caching headers that you specify in the response. You can
specify these response headers either through your framework, directly in your
code, or through App Engine static file and directory
handlers .
In the Google Front End, the cache key is the full URL of the request.
Caching static content
To ensure that clients always receive updated static content as soon as it is
published, we recommend that you serve static content from versioned
directories, such as css/v1/styles.css . The Google Front End won't validate
the cache (check for updated content) until the cache expires. Even after the
cache expires, the cache won't be updated until the content at the request
URL changes.
The following response headers that you can
set in app.yaml
influence how and when the Google Front End caches content:
Cache-Control should be set to public for the Google Front End to cache
content; it may also be cached by the Google Front End unless you specify a
Cache-Control private or no-store directive. If you don't set this
header in app.yaml , App Engine automatically adds it for all
responses handled by a static file or directory handler. For more
information, see Headers added or
replaced .
Vary : To enable the cache to return different responses for a URL based on
headers that are sent in the request, set one or more of the following values
in the Vary response header:
Accept , Accept-Encoding , Origin , or X-Origin
Due to the potential for high cardinality, data won't be cached for other
Vary values.
For example:
You specify the following response header:
Vary: Accept-Encoding
You app receives a request that contains the Accept-Encoding: gzip header.
App Engine returns a compressed response and the Google Front End
caches the gzipped version of the response data. All subsequent requests
for this URL that contain the Accept-Encoding: gzip header will receive
the gzipped data from the cache until the cache becomes invalidated (due to
the content changing after the cache expires).
Your app receives a request that doesn't contain the Accept-Encoding
header. App Engine returns an uncompressed response and Google
Frontend caches the uncompressed version of the response data. All subsequent
requests for this URL that don't contain the Accept-Encoding header
receive uncompressed data from the cache until the cache becomes
invalidated.
If you don't specify a Vary response header, the Google Front End creates
a single cache entry for the URL and will use it for all requests regardless
of the headers in the request. For example:
You don't specify the Vary: Accept-Encoding response header.
A request contains the Accept-Encoding: gzip header, and the gzipped
version of the response data will be cached.
A second request doesn't contain the Accept-Encoding: gzip header.
However, because the cache contains a gzipped version of the response data,
the response will be gzipped even though the client requested uncompressed
data.
The headers in the request also influence caching:
If the request contains an Authorization header, the content won't be
cached by the Google Front End.
Cache expiration
By default, the caching headers that App Engine static file and
directory handlers add to responses instruct clients and web proxies such as the
Google Front End to expire the cache after 10 minutes.
After a file is transmitted with a given expiration time, there is generally
no way to clear it out of web-proxy caches, even if the user clears their
own browser cache. Re-deploying a new version of the app will not reset any
caches. Therefore, if you ever plan to modify a static file, it should have a
short (less than one hour) expiration time. In most cases, the default 10-minute
expiration time is appropriate.
You can change the default expiration for all static file and directory handlers
by specifying the default_expiration
element in your app.yaml file. To set specific expiration times for individiual
handlers,
specify the expiration
element within the handler element in your app.yaml file.
The value you specify in the expiration elements time will be used to
set the Cache-Control and Expires HTTP response headers.
Forcing HTTPS connections
For security reasons, all applications should encourage clients to connect over
https . To instruct the browser to prefer https over http for a given page
or entire domain, set the Strict-Transport-Security header in your responses.
For example:
Strict-Transport-Security : max-age = 31536000 ; includeSubDomains
To set this header for any static content that is served by your app, add the
header to your app's static file and directory
handlers .
To set this header for responses that are generated from your code, use the
flask-talisman library .
Caution: Clients that have received the header in the past will refuse to connect if
https becomes non-functional or is disabled for any reason. To learn more, see
this Cheat Sheet on HTTP Strict Transport Security .
Handling asynchronous background work
Background work is any work that your app performs for a request after you have
delivered your HTTP response. Avoid performing background work in your app, and
review your code to make sure all asynchronous operations finish before you
deliver your response.
For long-running jobs, we recommend using Cloud Tasks . With
Cloud Tasks, HTTP requests are long-lived and return a response only
after any asynchronous work ends.
Warning: Performing asynchronous background work can result in higher billing.
App Engine might scale up additional instances due to high CPU load,
even if there are no active requests. Users may also experience increased
latency because of requests waiting in the pending queue for available instances.
App Engine pending queue prioritization
During periods of heavy traffic, App Engine might place
requests in a pending queue while waiting for an available instance with the
following prioritization:
App Engine prioritizes other queued requests over pending
queued requests from Task queue .
Requests from App Engine Cloud Tasks also share this pending
queue priority behavior for compatibility reasons.
Within the pending queue, App Engine treats requests from HTTP target
Cloud Tasks as regular HTTP
traffic. The HTTP target requests aren't at a lower priority.
When a service receives standard HTTP traffic at high volume while also
serving Task queue or Cloud Tasks traffic at much lower volume,
there is a disproportionate impact on the latency of the Task queue or the
Cloud Tasks traffic. We recommend splitting the traffic types to
separate versions or using HTTP target tasks to avoid priority queuing. You
should also consider serving latency sensitive requests from Cloud Tasks
with a dedicated major version or service.
