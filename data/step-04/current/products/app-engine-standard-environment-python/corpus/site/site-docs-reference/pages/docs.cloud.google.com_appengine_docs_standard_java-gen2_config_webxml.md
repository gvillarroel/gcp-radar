The deployment descriptor: web.xml
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Region ID
The REGION_ID is an abbreviated code that Google assigns
based on the region you select when you create your app. The code does not
correspond to a country or province, even though some region IDs may appear
similar to commonly used country and province codes. For apps created after
February 2020, REGION_ID .r is included in
App Engine URLs. For existing apps created before this date, the
region ID is optional in the URL.

Note: If you use legacy bundled services and want to upgrade to Java 25, you
can choose to continue using javax.servlet.* APIs only if your apps run on
Java Enterprise Edition 8 (EE8). You must update your appengine-web.xml file
if you choose to remain on EE8. To learn more about your configuration options,
see Upgrade an existing application .
Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map
to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file
is named web.xml , and is part of the servlet specification for web applications.
For more information about the web.xml deployment descriptor, see the
servlet specification .
If you are migrating from Java 8 and need to use the
legacy bundled services with the latest supported Java version, you must add the
<app-engine-apis> element and set it to true in your web.xml file:
< app - engine - apis>true < / app - engine - apis >
Deployment descriptors
A web application's deployment descriptor describes the classes, resources and
configuration of the application and how the web server uses them to serve web
requests. When the web server receives a request for the application, it uses
the deployment descriptor to map the URL of the request to the code that ought
to handle the request.
The deployment descriptor is a file named web.xml . It resides in the app's WAR
under the WEB-INF/ directory. The file is an XML file whose root element is
<web-app> .
The following web.xml example maps all URL paths ( /* ) to the servlet
class mysite.server.ComingSoonServlet for Jakarta EE 10, EE 11 on servlet 6.0, and Java EE 8. To use the latest supported version on
the default configuration, you must update your application servlets and
dependencies to include the Jakarta namespace. To learn more about your configuration options,
see Upgrade an existing application .

If you factor your application into services, each service has its own
configuration parameters.
Servlets and URL paths
web.xml defines mappings between URL paths and the servlets that handle
requests with those paths. The web server uses this configuration to identify
the servlet to handle a given request and call the class method that corresponds
to the request method. For example: the doGet() method for HTTP GET
requests.
To map a URL to a servlet, you declare the servlet with the <servlet> element,
then define a mapping from a URL path to a servlet declaration with the
<servlet-mapping> element.
The <servlet> element declares the servlet, including a name used to refer to
the servlet by other elements in the file, the class to use for the servlet, and
initialization parameters. You can declare multiple servlets using the same
class with different initialization parameters. The name for each servlet must
be unique across the deployment descriptor.
<servlet>
<servlet-name>redteam</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>mysite.server.TeamServlet</servlet-class>
<init-param>
<param-name>teamColor</param-name>
<param-value>red</param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
<param-name>bgColor</param-name>
<param-value>#CC0000</param-value>
</init-param>
</servlet>
<servlet>
<servlet-name>blueteam</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>mysite.server.TeamServlet</servlet-class>
<init-param>
<param-name>teamColor</param-name>
<param-value>blue</param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
<param-name>bgColor</param-name>
<param-value>#0000CC</param-value>
</init-param>
</servlet>
The <servlet-mapping> element specifies a URL pattern and the name of a
declared servlet to use for requests whose URL matches the pattern. The URL
pattern can use an asterisk ( * ) at the beginning or end of the pattern to
indicate zero or more of any character. The URL pattern does not support wildcards
in the middle of a string, and does not allow multiple wildcards in one
pattern. The pattern matches the full path of the URL, starting with and
including the forward slash ( / ) following the domain name. The URL path cannot
start with a period ( . ).
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>redteam</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/red/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>blueteam</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/blue/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
With this example, a request for the URL
http://www.example.com/blue/teamProfile is handled by the TeamServlet class,
with the teamColor parameter equal to blue and the bgColor parameter equal
to #0000CC . The servlet can get the portion of the URL path matched by the
wildcard using the ServletRequest object's getPathInfo() method.
Note: Static files that are served verbatim to users, such as images, CSS
or JavaScript, are handled separately from paths mentioned in the deployment
descriptor. A request for a URL path that matches a path to a file in the WAR
that's considered a static file will serve the file, regardless of servlet and
filter mappings in the deployment descriptor. You can exclude files from those
treated as static files using the
appengine-web.xml file.
The servlet can access its initialization parameters by getting its servlet
configuration using its own getServletConfig() method, then calling the
getInitParameter() method on the configuration object using the name of the
parameter as an argument.
String teamColor = getServletConfig (). getInitParameter ( "teamColor" );
JSPs
An app can use JavaServer Pages (JSPs) to implement web pages. JSPs are servlets
defined using static content, such as HTML, mixed with Java code.
App Engine supports automatic compilation and URL mapping for JSPs. A JSP file
in the application's WAR (outside of WEB-INF/ ) whose filename ends in .jsp
is compiled into a servlet class automatically, and mapped to the URL path
equivalent to the path to the JSP file from the WAR root. For example, if an app
has a JSP file named start.jsp in a subdirectory named register/ in its WAR,
App Engine compiles it and maps it to the URL path /register/start.jsp .
If you want more control over how the JSP is mapped to a URL, you can specify
the mapping explicitly by declaring it with a <servlet> element in the
deployment descriptor. Instead of a <servlet-class> element, you specify a
<jsp-file> element with the path to the JSP file from the WAR root. The
<servlet> element for the JSP can contain initialization parameters.
<servlet>
<servlet-name>register</servlet-name>
<jsp-file>/register/start.jsp</jsp-file>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>register</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/register/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
Note: The <jsp-file> must start with a forward slash ( / ) if the JSP is in
the application's root directory.
You can install JSP tag libraries with the <taglib> element. A tag library has
a path to the JSP Tag Library Descriptor (TLD) file ( <taglib-location> ) and a
URI that JSPs use to select the library for loading ( <taglib-uri> ). Note that
App Engine provides the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag
Library (JSTL), and you don't need to
install it.
<taglib>
<taglib-uri>/escape</taglib-uri>
<taglib-location>/WEB-INF/escape-tags.tld</taglib-location>
</taglib>
Security and authentication
An App Engine application can use Google Accounts for user authentication. The
app can use the Google Accounts API to
detect whether the user is signed in, get the currently signed-in user's email
address, and generate sign-in and sign-out URLs. An app can also specify access
restrictions for URL paths based on Google Accounts, using the deployment
descriptor.
The <security-constraint> element defines a security constraint for URLs that
match a pattern. If a user accesses a URL whose path has a security constraint
and the user is not signed in, App Engine redirects the user to the Google
Accounts sign-in page. Google Accounts redirects the user back to the
application URL after successfully signing in or registering a new account. The
app does not need to do anything else to ensure that only signed-in users can
access the URL.
A security constraint includes an authorization constraint that specifies which
Google Accounts users can access the path. If the authorization constraint
specifies a user role of * , then any users signed in with a Google Account can
access the URL. If the constraint specifies a user role of admin , then only
registered developers of the application can access the URL. The admin role
makes it easy to build administrator-only sections of your site.
<security-constraint>
<web-resource-collection>
<web-resource-name>profile</web-resource-name>
<url-pattern>/profile/*</url-pattern>
</web-resource-collection>
<auth-constraint>
<role-name>*</role-name>
</auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>
<security-constraint>
<web-resource-collection>
<web-resource-name>admin</web-resource-name>
<url-pattern>/admin/*</url-pattern>
</web-resource-collection>
<auth-constraint>
<role-name>admin</role-name>
</auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>
Note: G Suite domain administrators and App Engine domain administrators are not
included in the admin role in this context. Only the application developers,
such as those in Viewer , Owner , or Developer roles, can access these
portions of the application.
App Engine does not support custom security roles ( <security-role> ) or
alternate authentication mechanisms ( <login-config> ) in the deployment
descriptor.
Security constraints apply to static files as well as servlets.
Secure URLs
App Engine supports secure connections with HTTPS for URLs using the
REGION_ID .r.appspot.com domain. When a request accesses a URL using HTTPS, and that URL
is configured to use HTTPS in the web.xml file, both the request data and the
response data are encrypted by the sender before they are transmitted, and
decrypted by the recipient after they are received. Secure connections are
useful for protecting customer data, such as contact information, passwords, and
private messages.
Note: To use G Suite domains with HTTPS, you must first
activate and configure SSL for App Engine with your
domain .
Otherwise, users attempting to view pages via HTTPS on your domain will likely
see timeouts, errors, or warnings.
To declare that HTTPS should be used for a URL, you set up a security constraint
in the deployment descriptor (as described in
Security and authentication ) with a
<user-data-constraint> whose <transport-guarantee> is CONFIDENTIAL .
For example:
<security-constraint>
<web-resource-collection>
<web-resource-name>profile</web-resource-name>
<url-pattern>/profile/*</url-pattern>
</web-resource-collection>
<user-data-constraint>
<transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
</user-data-constraint>
</security-constraint>
Requests using HTTP (non-secure) for URLs whose transport guarantee is
CONFIDENTIAL are automatically redirected to the same URL using HTTPS.
Any URL can use the CONFIDENTIAL transport guarantee, including JSPs and
static files.
The development web server does not support HTTPS connections. It ignores the
transport guarantee, so paths intended for use with HTTPS can be tested using
regular HTTP connections to the development web server.
When you test your app's HTTPS handlers using the versioned appspot.com URL,
such as https://1.latest. your_app_id . REGION_ID .r.appspot.com/ ,
your browser warns you that the HTTPS certificate was not signed for that
specific domain path. If you accept the certificate for that domain, pages will
load successfully. Users will not see the certificate warning when accessing
https:// your_app_id . REGION_ID .r.appspot.com/ .
You can also use an alternate form of the versioned appspot.com URL designed to
avoid this problem by replacing the periods separating the subdomain components
with the string " -dot- ". For instance, the previous example could be accessed
without a certificate warning at
https:// VERSION_ID -dot-default-dot- PROJECT_ID . REGION_ID .r.appspot.com .
Google Accounts sign-in and sign-out are always performed using a secure
connection and is unrelated to how the application's URLs are configured.
As mentioned above, security constraints apply to static files as well as
servlets. This includes the transport guarantee.
Note: Google recommends
using the HTTPS protocol to send requests to your app. Google does not issue SSL
certificates for double-wildcard domains hosted at appspot.com . Therefore with HTTPS
you must use the string "-dot-" instead of "." to separate subdomains, as shown in the examples
below. You can use a simple "." with your own custom domain or with HTTP addresses.
The welcome file list
When the URLs for your site represent paths to static files or JSPs in your WAR,
it is often a good idea for paths to directories to do something useful as well.
A user visiting the URL path /help/accounts/password.jsp for information on
account passwords might try to visit /help/accounts/ to find a page
introducing the account system documentation. The deployment descriptor can
specify a list of filenames that the server should try when the user accesses a
path that represents a WAR subdirectory that is not already explicitly mapped
to a servlet. The servlet specification calls this the welcome file list .
For example, if the user accesses the URL path /help/accounts/ , the following
<welcome-file-list> element in the deployment descriptor tells the server to
check for help/accounts/index.jsp and help/accounts/index.html before
reporting that the URL does not exist:
<welcome-file-list>
<welcome-file>index.jsp</welcome-file>
<welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>
</welcome-file-list>
Filters
A filter is a class that acts on a request like a servlet, but can
allow the handling of the request to continue with other filters or servlets. A
filter may perform an auxiliary task, such as logging, performing specialized
authentication checks, or annotating the request or response objects before
calling the servlet. Filters allow you to compose request processing tasks from
the deployment descriptor.
The following filter implementation example logs a
message, and passes control down the chain, which may include other filters or a
servlet, as described by the deployment descriptor for version 21 and later on
EE10 (default), version 21 on EE8, and version 17 and earlier. To use the latest supported version on
the default configuration, you must update your application servlets and
dependencies to include the Jakarta namespace. To learn more about your configuration options,
see Upgrade an existing application .
v21 and later (EE10)
This filter class implements the jakarta.servlet.Filter interface with the
doFilter() method.
package mysite.server ;

+ " request" );
filterChain . doFilter ( request , response );
}
public FilterConfig getFilterConfig () {
return filterConfig ;
}
public void init ( FilterConfig filterConfig ) {
this . filterConfig = filterConfig ;
}
public void destroy () {}
}
v21 (EE8)
This filter class implements the javax.servlet.Filter interface with the
doFilter() method.
package mysite.server ;
import java.io.IOException ;
import java.util.logging.Logger ;
import javax.servlet.Filter ;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain ;

throws IOException , ServletException {
log . warning ( "Log filter processed a " + getFilterConfig (). getInitParameter ( "logType" )
+ " request" );
filterChain . doFilter ( request , response );
}
public FilterConfig getFilterConfig () {
return filterConfig ;
}
public void init ( FilterConfig filterConfig ) {
this . filterConfig = filterConfig ;
}
public void destroy () {}
}
v17 and earlier
This filter class implements the javax.servlet.Filter interface with the
doFilter() method.
package mysite.server ;
import java.io.IOException ;
import java.util.logging.Logger ;
import javax.servlet.Filter ;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain ;
import javax.servlet.FilterConfig ;
import javax.servlet.ServletException ;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest ;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse ;
public class LogFilterImpl implements Filter {
private FilterConfig filterConfig ;
private static final Logger log = Logger . getLogger ( LogFilterImpl . class . getName ());
public void doFilter ( ServletRequest request , ServletResponse response , FilterChain filterChain )
throws IOException , ServletException {
log . warning ( "Log filter processed a " + getFilterConfig (). getInitParameter ( "logType" )
+ " request" );
filterChain . doFilter ( request , response );
}
public FilterConfig getFilterConfig () {
return filterConfig ;
}
public void init ( FilterConfig filterConfig ) {
this . filterConfig = filterConfig ;
}
public void destroy () {}
}
Similar to servlets, you configure a filter in the deployment descriptor by
declaring the filter with the <filter> element, then mapping it to a URL
pattern with the <filter-mapping> element. You can also map filters directly
to other servlets.
The <filter> element contains a <filter-name> , <filter-class> , and
optional <init-param> elements.
<filter>
<filter-name>logSpecial</filter-name>
<filter-class>mysite.server.LogFilterImpl</filter-class>
<init-param>
<param-name>logType</param-name>
<param-value>special</param-value>
</init-param>
</filter>
The <filter-mapping> element contains a <filter-name> that matches the name
of a declared filter, and either a <url-pattern> element for applying the
filter to URLs, or a <servlet-name> element that matches the name of a
declared servlet for applying the filter whenever the servlet is called.
<!-- Log for all URLs ending in ".special" -->
<filter-mapping>
<filter-name>logSpecial</filter-name>
<url-pattern>*.special</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
<!-- Log for all URLs that use the "comingsoon" servlet -->
<filter-mapping>
<filter-name>logSpecial</filter-name>
<servlet-name>comingsoon</servlet-name>
</filter-mapping>
Note: Filters are not invoked on static assets, even if the path matches a
filter-mapping pattern. Static files are served directly to the browser.
Error handlers
You can customize what the server sends to the user when an error occurs, using
the deployment descriptor. The server can display an alternate page location
when it's about to send a particular HTTP status code, or when a servlet raises
a particular Java exception.
The <error-page> element contains either an <error-code> element with an
HTTP error code value (such as 500 ), or an <exception-type> element with the
class name of the expected exception (such as java.io.IOException ). It also
contains a <location> element containing the URL path of the resource to show
when the error occurs.
<error-page>
<error-code>500</error-code>
<location>/errors/servererror.jsp</location>
</error-page>
You can't configure custom error handlers for the following error
conditions:
404 response page when no servlet mapping is defined for a URL.
403 quota error page
500 server error page that appears after an App Engine internal error.
Unsupported web.xml features
The following web.xml features are not supported by App Engine:
App Engine supports the <load-on-startup> element for servlet declarations.
However, the load actually occurs during the first request handled by the web
server instance, not prior to it.
Some deployment descriptor elements can take a human readable display name,
description and icon for use in IDEs. App Engine doesn't use these, and
ignores them.
App Engine doesn't support JNDI environment variables ( <env-entry> ).
App Engine doesn't support EJB resources ( <resource-ref> ).
Notification of the destruction of servlets, servlet context, or filters is
not supported.
The <distributable> element is ignored.
Servlet scheduling with <run-at> is not supported.
