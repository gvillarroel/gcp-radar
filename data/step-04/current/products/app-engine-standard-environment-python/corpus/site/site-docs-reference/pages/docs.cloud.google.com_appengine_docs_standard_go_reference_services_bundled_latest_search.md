Package google.golang.org/appengine/v2/search (v2.0.6)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: To get more information about this package, such as access to older versions, view this package on pkg.go.dev .
Package search provides a client for App Engine's search service.
Basic Operations
Indexes contain documents. Each index is identified by its name: a
human-readable ASCII string.
Within an index, documents are associated with an ID, which is also
a human-readable ASCII string. A document's contents are a mapping from
case-sensitive field names to values. Valid types for field values are:
string,
search.Atom,
search.HTML,
time.Time (stored with millisecond precision),
float64 (value between -2,147,483,647 and 2,147,483,647 inclusive),
appengine.GeoPoint.
The Get and Put methods on an Index load and save a document.
A document's contents are typically represented by a struct pointer.
Example code:
type Doc struct {
Author string
Comment string
Creation time . Time
}
index , err := search . Open ( "comments" )
if err != nil {
return err
}
newID , err := index . Put ( ctx , "" , & Doc {
Author : "gopher" ,
Comment : "the truth of the matter" ,
Creation : time . Now (),
})
if err != nil {
return err
}
A single document can be retrieved by its ID. Pass a destination struct
to Get to hold the resulting document.
var doc Doc
err := index . Get ( ctx , id , & doc )
if err != nil {
return err
}
Search and Listing Documents
Indexes have two methods for retrieving multiple documents at once: Search and
List.
Searching an index for a query will result in an iterator. As with an iterator
from package datastore, pass a destination struct to Next to decode the next
result. Next will return Done when the iterator is exhausted.
for t := index . Search ( ctx , "Comment:truth" , nil ); ; {
var doc Doc
id , err := t . Next ( & doc )
if err == search . Done {
break
}
if err != nil {
return err
}
fmt . Fprintf ( w , "%s -> %#v\n" , id , doc )
}
Search takes a string query to determine which documents to return. The query
can be simple, such as a single word to match, or complex. The query
language is described at
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/search/query_strings
Search also takes an optional SearchOptions struct which gives much more
control over how results are calculated and returned.
Call List to iterate over all documents in an index.
for t := index . List ( ctx , nil ); ; {
var doc Doc
id , err := t . Next ( & doc )
if err == search . Done {
break
}
if err != nil {
return err
}
fmt . Fprintf ( w , "%s -> %#v\n" , id , doc )
}
Fields and Facets
A document's contents can be represented by a variety of types. These are
typically struct pointers, but they can also be represented by any type
implementing the FieldLoadSaver interface. The FieldLoadSaver allows metadata
to be set for the document with the DocumentMetadata type. Struct pointers are
more strongly typed and are easier to use; FieldLoadSavers are more flexible.
A document's contents can be expressed in two ways: fields and facets.
Fields are the most common way of providing content for documents. Fields can
store data in multiple types and can be matched in searches using query
strings.
Facets provide a way to attach categorical information to a document. The only
valid types for facets are search.Atom and float64. Facets allow search
results to contain summaries of the categories matched in a search, and to
restrict searches to only match against specific categories.
By default, for struct pointers, all of the struct fields are used as document
fields, and the field name used is the same as on the struct (and hence must
start with an upper case letter). Struct fields may have a
search:&quot;name,options&quot; tag. The name must start with a letter and be
composed only of word characters. A "-" tag name means that the field will be
ignored. If options is "facet" then the struct field will be used as a
document facet. If options is "" then the comma may be omitted. There are no
other recognized options.
Example code:
// A and B are renamed to a and b.
// A, C and I are facets.
// D's tag is equivalent to having no tag at all (E).
// F and G are ignored entirely by the search package.
// I has tag information for both the search and json packages.
type TaggedStruct struct {
A float64 `search:"a,facet"`
B float64 `search:"b"`
C float64 `search:",facet"`
D float64 `search:""`
E float64
F float64 `search:"-"`
G float64 `search:"-,facet"`
I float64 `search:",facet" json:"i"`
}
The FieldLoadSaver Interface
A document's contents can also be represented by any type that implements the
FieldLoadSaver interface. This type may be a struct pointer, but it
does not have to be. The search package will call Load when loading the
document's contents, and Save when saving them. In addition to a slice of
Fields, the Load and Save methods also use the DocumentMetadata type to
provide additional information about a document (such as its Rank, or set of
Facets). Possible uses for this interface include deriving non-stored fields,
verifying fields or setting specific languages for string and HTML fields.
Example code:
type CustomFieldsExample struct {
// Item's title and which language it is in.
Title string
Lang string
// Mass, in grams.
Mass int
}
func ( x * CustomFieldsExample ) Load ( fields [] search . Field , meta * search . DocumentMetadata ) error {
// Load the title field, failing if any other field is found.
for _ , f := range fields {
if f . Name != "title" {
return fmt . Errorf ( "unknown field %q" , f . Name )
}
s , ok := f . Value .( string )
if ! ok {
return fmt . Errorf ( "unsupported type %T for field %q" , f . Value , f . Name )
}
x . Title = s
x . Lang = f . Language
}
// Load the mass facet, failing if any other facet is found.
for _ , f := range meta . Facets {
if f . Name != "mass" {
return fmt . Errorf ( "unknown facet %q" , f . Name )
}
m , ok := f . Value .( float64 )
if ! ok {
return fmt . Errorf ( "unsupported type %T for facet %q" , f . Value , f . Name )
}
x . Mass = int ( m )
}
return nil
}
func ( x * CustomFieldsExample ) Save () ([] search . Field , * search . DocumentMetadata , error ) {
fields := [] search . Field {
{ Name : "title" , Value : x . Title , Language : x . Lang },
}
meta := & search . DocumentMetadata {
Facets : {
{ Name : "mass" , Value : float64 ( x . Mass )},
},
}
return fields , meta , nil
}
Variables
ErrInvalidDocumentType, ErrNoSuchDocument, ErrTooManyDocuments
var (
// ErrInvalidDocumentType is returned when methods like Put, Get or Next
// are passed a dst or src argument of invalid type.
ErrInvalidDocumentType = errors . New ( "search: invalid document type" )
// ErrNoSuchDocument is returned when no document was found for a given ID.
ErrNoSuchDocument = errors . New ( "search: no such document" )
// ErrTooManyDocuments is returned when the user passes too many documents to
// PutMulti or DeleteMulti.
ErrTooManyDocuments = fmt . Errorf ( "search: too many documents given to put or delete (max is %d)" , maxDocumentsPerPutDelete )
)
Done
var Done = errors . New ( "search: query has no more results" )
Done is returned when a query iteration has completed.

discovery for the search. Automatic facet discovery looks for the facets
which appear the most often in the aggregate in the matched documents.
The maximum number of facets returned is controlled by facetLimit, and the
maximum number of values per facet by facetLimit. A limit of zero indicates
a default limit should be used.

FieldLoadSaver can be converted from and to a slice of Fields
with additional document metadata.
HTML
type HTML string
HTML is a document field whose contents are indexed as HTML. Only text nodes
are indexed: "foo bar" will be treated as "foobar".
Index
type Index struct {
// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
Index is an index of documents.
func Open
func Open ( name string ) ( * Index , error )
Open opens the index with the given name. The index is created if it does
not already exist.
The name is a human-readable ASCII string. It must contain no whitespace
characters and not start with "!".
func (*Index) Delete
func ( x * Index ) Delete ( c context . Context , id string ) error
Delete deletes a document from the index.
func (*Index) DeleteMulti
func ( x * Index ) DeleteMulti ( c context . Context , ids [] string ) error
DeleteMulti deletes multiple documents from the index.
The returned error may be an instance of appengine.MultiError, in which case
it will be the same size as srcs and the individual errors inside will
correspond with the items in srcs.
func (*Index) Get
func ( x * Index ) Get ( c context . Context , id string , dst interface {}) error
Get loads the document with the given ID into dst.
The ID is a human-readable ASCII string. It must be non-empty, contain no
whitespace characters and not start with "!".
dst must be a non-nil struct pointer or implement the FieldLoadSaver
interface.
ErrFieldMismatch is returned when a field is to be loaded into a different
type than the one it was stored from, or when a field is missing or
unexported in the destination struct. ErrFieldMismatch is only returned if
dst is a struct pointer. It is up to the callee to decide whether this error
is fatal, recoverable, or ignorable.
func (*Index) List
func ( x * Index ) List ( c context . Context , opts * ListOptions ) * Iterator
List lists all of the documents in an index. The documents are returned in
increasing ID order.
func (*Index) Put
func ( x * Index ) Put ( c context . Context , id string , src interface {}) ( string , error )
Put saves src to the index. If id is empty, a new ID is allocated by the
service and returned. If id is not empty, any existing index entry for that
ID is replaced.
The ID is a human-readable ASCII string. It must contain no whitespace
characters and not start with "!".
src must be a non-nil struct pointer or implement the FieldLoadSaver
interface.
func (*Index) PutMulti
func ( x * Index ) PutMulti ( c context . Context , ids [] string , srcs [] interface {}) ([] string , error )
PutMulti is like Put, but is more efficient for adding multiple documents to
the index at once.
Up to 200 documents can be added at once. ErrTooManyDocuments is returned if
you try to add more.
ids can either be an empty slice (which means new IDs will be allocated for
each of the documents added) or a slice the same size as srcs.
The error may be an instance of appengine.MultiError, in which case it will
be the same size as srcs and the individual errors inside will correspond
with the items in srcs.
func (*Index) Search
func ( x * Index ) Search ( c context . Context , query string , opts * SearchOptions ) * Iterator
Search searches the index for the given query.
Iterator
type Iterator struct {
// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
Iterator is the result of searching an index for a query or listing an
index.
func (*Iterator) Count
func ( t * Iterator ) Count () int
Count returns an approximation of the number of documents matched by the
query. It is only valid to call for iterators returned by Search.
func (*Iterator) Cursor
func ( t * Iterator ) Cursor () Cursor
Cursor returns the cursor associated with the current document (that is,
the document most recently returned by a call to Next).
Passing this cursor in a future call to Search will cause those results
to commence with the first document after the current document.
func (*Iterator) Facets
func ( t * Iterator ) Facets () ([][] FacetResult , error )
Facets returns the facets found within the search results, if any facets
were requested in the SearchOptions.
func (*Iterator) Next
func ( t * Iterator ) Next ( dst interface {}) ( string , error )
Next returns the ID of the next result. When there are no more results,
Done is returned as the error.
dst must be a non-nil struct pointer, implement the FieldLoadSaver
interface, or be a nil interface value. If a non-nil dst is provided, it
will be filled with the indexed fields. dst is ignored if this iterator was
created with an IDsOnly option.
ListOptions
type ListOptions struct {
// StartID is the inclusive lower bound for the ID of the returned
// documents. The zero value means all documents will be returned.
StartID string
// Limit is the maximum number of documents to return. The zero value
// indicates no limit.
Limit int
// IDsOnly indicates that only document IDs should be returned for the list
// operation; no document fields are populated.
IDsOnly bool
}
ListOptions are the options for listing documents in an index. Passing a nil
*ListOptions is equivalent to using the default values.
Range
type Range struct {
Start , End float64
}
Range represents a numeric range with inclusive start and exclusive end.
Start may be specified as math.Inf(-1) to indicate there is no minimum
value, and End may similarly be specified as math.Inf(1); at least one of
Start or End must be a finite number.
func AtLeast
func AtLeast ( min float64 ) Range
AtLeast returns a Range matching any value greater than, or equal to, min.
func LessThan
func LessThan ( max float64 ) Range
LessThan returns a Range matching any value less than max.

// MatchScorer assigns a score based on term frequency in a document.
MatchScorer Scorer = enumScorer { pb . ScorerSpec_MATCH_SCORER }
// RescoringMatchScorer assigns a score based on the quality of the query
// match. It is similar to a MatchScorer but uses a more complex scoring
// algorithm based on match term frequency and other factors like field type.
// Please be aware that this algorithm is continually refined and can change
// over time without notice. This means that the ordering of search results
// that use this scorer can also change without notice.
RescoringMatchScorer Scorer = enumScorer { pb . ScorerSpec_RESCORING_MATCH_SCORER }
)
SearchOptions
type SearchOptions struct {
// Limit is the maximum number of documents to return. The zero value

// Expressions specifies additional computed fields to add to each returned
// document.
Expressions [] FieldExpression
// Facets controls what facet information is returned for these search results.
// If no options are specified, no facet results will be returned.
