Google's Text Search API helps find places using text queries, like "pizza in New York", handling ambiguous addresses and non-address searches.
Requests require a textQuery and a FieldMask specifying desired data fields to manage cost and response size.
Optional parameters include location bias, language, and place type filtering for refining search results.
Responses are in JSON format, containing an array of Place objects with details about each matching location.
Billing is based on requested data fields, and location biasing influences results but can be overridden by explicit query mentions.

Introduction
Text Search (New)
returns information about a set of places based on a string (for example,
"pizza in New York" or "shoe stores near Ottawa" or "123 Main Street"). The
service responds with a list of places matching the text string and any location
bias that has been set.
In addition to required parameters ,
Text Search (New) supports refining queries using
optional parameters for better results.
The APIs Explorer lets you make live requests so that you can get familiar with
the API and the API options:

Text Search (New) requests
A Text Search (New) request is an HTTP POST request of the following form:
https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText
Pass all parameters in the JSON request body or in headers as part of the
POST request. For example:
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery" : "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia"
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress,places.priceLevel' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
Text Search (New) responses
Text Search (New) returns a
JSON object as a response . In the response:
The places array contains all matching places.
Each place in the array is represented by a
Place
object. The Place object contains detailed information about a single
place.
The FieldMask passed in the request specifies the
list of fields returned in the Place object.
The list of places returned is not guaranteed to be consistent for identical requests.
The complete JSON object is in the form:
{
"places": [
{
object (Place)
}
]
}
Note: Text Search (New) returns a maximum of 60 results across all pages,
although this limit is subject to change.
Required parameters
FieldMask
Specify the list of fields to return in the response by creating a
response field mask .
Pass the response field mask to the method by using the URL parameter
$fields or fields , or by using the HTTP header
X-Goog-FieldMask . There is no default list of returned fields in the response.
If you omit the field mask, the method returns an error.
Field masking is a good design practice to ensure that you don't request
unnecessary data, which helps to avoid unnecessary processing time and
billing charges.
Specify a comma-separated list of place data types to return. For example,
to retrieve the display name and the address of the place.
X - Goog - FieldMask : places . displayName , places . formattedAddress
Note: Spaces are not allowed anywhere
in the field list.
Use * to retrieve all fields.
X - Goog - FieldMask : *
While the
wildcard (*) is fine to use in development, Google discourages the use of the
wildcard response field mask in production because of the large amount
of data that can be returned.
Further guidance for using places.iconMaskBaseUri and
places.iconBackgroundColor can be found in
Place Icons section.

* Text Search and Nearby Search only
textQuery
The text string on which to search. For example, "restaurant",
"123 Main Street", or "Best place to visit in San Francisco". The API
returns candidate matches based
on this string and orders the results based on their perceived relevance.
Text Search (New) is not intended for ambiguous
queries, including the following:
Query type
Example
Too many concepts or constraints, such as the names of multiple places, roads, or cities in a single query
"Market Street San Francisco San Jose Airport"
Postal address elements not represented on Google Maps
"C/O John Smith 123 Main Street"
"P.O. Box 13 San Francisco"
Names of businesses, chains, or categories combined with locations where these entities are not available
"Tesco near Dallas, Texas"
Ambiguous queries with multiple interpretations
"Charger drop-off"
Historical names no longer in use
"Middlesex United Kingdom"
Non-geospatial elements or intent
"How many boats are in Ventura Harbor?"
Unofficial or vanity names
"The Jenga"
"The Helter Skelter"
Latitude and longitude coordinates
"37.422131,-122.084801"
Note: For best results when searching on a phone number,
include the country code followed by a space, and set the
regionCode parameter to correspond to the country code.
Phone number formats vary by country and the API attempts to return a result for these
different formats. For valid phone numbers, Places API (New) supports the
E.164 format .
Alphabet characters are converted based on the
E.161 keypad mapping .
Optional parameters
includeFutureOpeningBusinesses
If true , returns businesses
that are expected to open in the future. Defaults to false .
To retrieve the business status,
include places.businessStatus in your request field mask. To retrieve the anticipated opening date of the business, include
places.openingDate in your request field mask.
includedType
Biases the results to places matching the specified type defined by
Table A .
Only one type may be specified. For example:
"includedType":"bar"
"includedType":"pharmacy"
Note: The values in
Table B
are only returned in the response. You cannot use values in
Table B
as a filter.
Text Search (New) applies type filtering for certain queries, depending on applicability. For example, type filtering may not be applied to queries for specific addresses ("123 Main Street"), but type filtering is almost always applied to categorical queries ("stores nearby" or "shopping malls").
To apply type filtering to all queries, set strictTypeFiltering to true .
This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
includePureServiceAreaBusinesses
If set to true , the response includes businesses that visit
or deliver to customers directly, but don't have a physical business
location. If set to false , the API returns only businesses with
a physical business location.
languageCode
The language in which to return results.
See the
list of supported languages .
Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
exhaustive.
If languageCode is not supplied, the API defaults to
en . If you specify an invalid language code, the API
returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
component.
If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
closest match.
The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
valid in one language but not in another.
locationBias
Specifies an area to search. This location serves as a bias which means
results around the specified location can be returned, including results
outside the specified area.
You can specify locationRestriction or locationBias ,
but not both. Think of locationRestriction as specifying the
region which the results must be within, and locationBias as
specifying the region that the results will likely be inside or near but can
be outside of the area.
Note: If you omit both
locationBias and locationRestriction , then the API
uses IP biasing by default. With IP biasing, the API uses the device's
IP address to bias the results.
Note:
The locationBias parameter can
be overridden if the textQuery contains
an explicit location such as Market in Barcelona .
In this case, locationBias is ignored.
Specify the region as a rectangular Viewport or as a circle .
A circle is defined by center point and radius in meters. The radius
must be between 0.0 and 50000.0, inclusive. The default radius is 0.0.
For example:
"locationBias" : {
"circle" : {
"center" : {
"latitude" : 37.7937 ,
"longitude" : - 122.3965
},
"radius" : 500.0
}
}
A rectangle is a latitude-longitude viewport, represented as two
diagonally opposite low and high points. The low point marks the southwest
corner of the rectangle, and the high point represents the northeast
corner of the rectangle.
A viewport is considered a
closed region, meaning it includes its boundary. The latitude bounds
must range between -90 to 90 degrees inclusive, and the longitude bounds
must range between -180 to 180 degrees inclusive:
If low = high , the viewport consists of
that single point.
If low.longitude > high.longitude , the
longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses the 180 degree
longitude line).
If low.longitude = -180 degrees and
high.longitude = 180 degrees, the viewport includes all
longitudes.
If low.longitude = 180 degrees and
high.longitude = -180 degrees, the longitude range is
empty.
If low.latitude > high.latitude , the
latitude range is empty.
Both low and high must be populated, and the represented box cannot be
empty. An empty viewport results in an error.
For example, this viewport fully encloses New York City:
"locationBias" : {
"rectangle" : {
"low" : {
"latitude" : 40.477398 ,
"longitude" : - 74.259087
},
"high" : {
"latitude" : 40.91618 ,
"longitude" : - 73.70018
}
}
}
locationRestriction
Specifies an area to search for categorical queries only , which can return multiple places (for example,
"Restaurants in New York" or "Shopping malls"). Results outside the
specified area are not returned.
Specify the region as a rectangular Viewport . For an example of
defining the Viewport, see the description
of locationBias .
You can specify locationRestriction or locationBias ,
but not both. Think of locationRestriction as specifying the
region which the results must be within, and locationBias as
specifying the region that the results will likely be inside or near but can
be outside of the area.
Note: If you omit both
locationBias and locationRestriction , then the API
uses IP biasing by default. With IP biasing, the API uses the IP address of
the device to bias the results.
maxResultCount (deprecated)
Deprecated: This field is deprecated in favor of pageSize . If both maxResultCount and pageSize are specified, pageSize will be used and maxResultCount will be ignored.
Specifies the number of results (between 1 and 20) to display per page.
For example, setting a maxResultCount value of 5 will return up to 5
results on the first page. If there are more results that can be returned
from the query, the response includes a nextPageToken that you
can pass into a subsequent request to access the next page.
Note: If maxResultCount is 0 or unspecified, the API will return 20 results per page by default. If maxResultCount is greater than 20, the API will return no more than 20 results per page.
evOptions
Specifies parameters for identifying available electric vehicle (EV)
charging connectors and charging rates.
connectorTypes
Filters by the type of EV charging connector available at a place. A
place that does not support any of the connector types will be filtered
out.
Supported EV charging connector types include combined (AC and DC)
chargers, Tesla chargers, GB/T-compliant chargers (for EV fast charging in
China), and wall outlet chargers. For more information, see the reference
documentation.
To filter results for a specific supported connector , set connectorTypes to that value. For example, to find J1772 type 1 connectors, set connectorTypes to EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_J1772 .
To filter results for unsupported connectors, set connectorTypes to EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_OTHER .
To filter results for any connector type that is a wall outlet, set connectorTypes to EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED_WALL_OUTLET .
To filter results for any connector type, either set connectorTypes to EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED or don't set a value for connectorTypes .
minimumChargingRateKw
Filters places by minimum EV charging rate in kilowatts (kW). Any
places with charging a rate less than the minimum charging rate are
filtered out. For example, to find EV chargers with charging rates that
are at least 10 kW, you can set this parameter to "10."
minRating
Restricts results to only those whose average user rating is greater than
or equal to this limit. Values must be between 0.0 and 5.0 (inclusive) in
increments of 0.5. For example: 0, 0.5, 1.0, ... , 5.0 inclusive. Values are
rounded up to the nearest 0.5. For example, a value of 0.6 eliminates all
results with a rating less than 1.0.
This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
openNow
If true , return only those places that are open for business
at the time the query is sent. If false , return all businesses
regardless of open status.
Places that don't specify opening hours in the Google Places database are
returned if you set this parameter to false .
This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
pageSize
Specifies the number of results (between 1 and 20) to display per page.
For example, setting a pageSize value of 5 will return up to 5
results on the first page. If there are more results that can be returned
from the query, the response includes a nextPageToken that you
can pass into a subsequent request to access the next page.
Note: If pageSize is 0 or unspecified, the API will return 20 results per page by default. If pageSize is greater than 20, the API will return no more than 20 results per page.
pageToken
Specifies the nextPageToken from the response body of the
previous page.
priceLevels
Restrict the search to places that are marked at certain price levels.
The default is to select all price levels.
Price levels can be expected for places of the following types:
Food and Drink
Services
Shopping
Places of non-supported types won't be included in the response if priceLevels is specified.
Specify an array of one or more of values defined by
PriceLevel .
For example:
"priceLevels" : [ "PRICE_LEVEL_INEXPENSIVE" , "PRICE_LEVEL_MODERATE" ]
Note: PRICE_LEVEL_FREE is
not allowed in a request. It is only used to populate the response.
This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
rankPreference
Specifies how the results are ranked in the response based on the type of
query:
For a categorical query such as "Restaurants in New York City",
RELEVANCE (rank results by search relevance) is the default.
You can set rankPreference to RELEVANCE or
DISTANCE (rank results by distance).
For a non-categorical query such as "Mountain View, CA", we recommend
that you leave rankPreference unset.
This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
regionCode
The region code used to format the response, specified as a
two-character CLDR code value. This parameter can also have a bias effect
on the search results. There is no default value.
If the country name of the formattedAddress field in the
response matches the regionCode , the country code is omitted
from formattedAddress . This parameter has no effect on
adrFormatAddress , which always includes the country
name when available, or on shortFormattedAddress , which never
includes it.
Most CLDR codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes,
with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is
"uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the
entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
The parameter can affect results based on applicable law.
strictTypeFiltering
Used with the includedType parameter. When set to
true , only places that match the specified types specified by
includedType are returned.
When false, the default, the response can contain places that don't match
the specified types.
Text Search (New) examples
Find a place by query string
The following example shows a Text Search (New) request for
"Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia":
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery" : "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia"
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress ' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
Note that the X-Goog-FieldMask header specifies that the
response
contains the following data fields: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress .
The response is then in the form:
{
"places" : [
{
"formattedAddress" : "367 Pitt St, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Mother Chu's Vegetarian Kitchen" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
{
"formattedAddress" : "175 First Ave, Five Dock NSW 2046, Australia" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Veggo Sizzle - Vegan & Vegetarian Restaurant, Five Dock, Sydney" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
{
"formattedAddress" : "29 King St, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Peace Harmony" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
...
]
}
Add more data types to the field mask to return additional information.
For example, add places.types,places.websiteUri to include the
restaurant type and Web address in the
response :
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery" : "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia"
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress, places.types,places.websiteUri ' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
The response is now in the form:
{
"places" : [
{
"types" : [
"vegetarian_restaurant" ,
"vegan_restaurant" ,
"chinese_restaurant" ,
"restaurant" ,
"food" ,
"point_of_interest" ,
"establishment"
],
"formattedAddress" : "367 Pitt St, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia" ,
"websiteUri" : "http://www.motherchusvegetarian.com.au/" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Mother Chu's Vegetarian Kitchen" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
{
"types" : [
"vegan_restaurant" ,
"thai_restaurant" ,
"vegetarian_restaurant" ,
"indian_restaurant" ,
"italian_restaurant" ,
"american_restaurant" ,
"restaurant" ,
"food" ,
"point_of_interest" ,
"establishment"
],
"formattedAddress" : "175 First Ave, Five Dock NSW 2046, Australia" ,
"websiteUri" : "http://www.veggosizzle.com.au/" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Veggo Sizzle - Vegan & Vegetarian Restaurant, Five Dock, Sydney" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
...
]
}
Filter places by price level
Use the priceLevel option to filter the results to restaurants
defined as inexpensive or moderately expensive:
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery" : "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia",
"priceLevels":["PRICE_LEVEL_INEXPENSIVE", "PRICE_LEVEL_MODERATE"]
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress, places.priceLevel ' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
This example also uses the X-Goog-FieldMask header to add the
places.priceLevel data field to the
response
so it is in the form:
{
"places" : [
{
"formattedAddress" : "367 Pitt St, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia" ,
"priceLevel" : "PRICE_LEVEL_MODERATE" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Mother Chu's Vegetarian Kitchen" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
{
"formattedAddress" : "115 King St, Newtown NSW 2042, Australia" ,
"priceLevel" : "PRICE_LEVEL_MODERATE" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Green Mushroom" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
...
]
}
Add additional options to refine your search, such as includedType ,
minRating , rankPreference , openNow ,
and other parameters described in
Optional parameters .
Note: These refinement parameters only apply
to queries such as "Restaurants in New York City" where the parameters help to
reduce the number of search results based on the specified option. Applying these
parameters to other type of queries—for example, to geographical queries such as
"Mountain View, CA" or "New York City"—can actually result in filtering out
meaningful results or reducing the number of meaningful results.
Restrict search to a specified area
Use locationRestriction or locationBias ,
but not both, to restrict a search to an area. Think of locationRestriction
as specifying the region which the results must be within, and locationBias
as specifying the region that the results must be near but can be outside of
the area.
Note: When using
locationRestriction , you can only specify the region as a
rectangular Viewport . When using locationBias ,
you can specify the region as a rectangular Viewport or as a
circle .
Restrict area using locationRestriction
Use the locationRestriction parameter to restrict query results to a
specified region. In your request body, specify the low and
high latitude and longitude values that define the region
boundary.
The following example shows a Text Search (New) request for "vegetarian
food" in New York City. This request only returns the first 10 results for
places that are open.
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery" : "vegetarian food",
"pageSize" : "10",
"locationRestriction": {
"rectangle": {
"low": {
"latitude": 40.477398,
"longitude": -74.259087
},
"high": {
"latitude": 40.91618,
"longitude": -73.70018
}
}
}
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.id,places.formattedAddress' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
Bias to an area using locationBias
The following example shows a Text Search (New) request for
"vegetarian food" biased to a location within 500 meters of a point in
downtown San Francisco. This request only returns the first 10 results for
places that are open.
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery" : "vegetarian food",
"openNow": true,
"pageSize": 10,
"locationBias": {
"circle": {
"center": {"latitude": 37.7937, "longitude": -122.3965},
"radius": 500.0
}
},
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
Search for EV chargers with a minimum charging rate
Use minimumChargingRateKw and connectorTypes to
search for places with available chargers that are compatible with your EV.
The following example shows a request for Tesla and J1772 type 1 EV charging
connectors with a minimum charging rate of 10 kW in Mountain View, CA. Only four
results are returned.
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery": "EV Charging Station Mountain View",
"pageSize": 4,
"evOptions": {
"minimumChargingRateKw": 10,
"connectorTypes": ["EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_J1772","EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_TESLA"]
}
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H "X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.evChargeOptions" \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
The request returns the following response:
{
"places" : [
{
"displayName" : {
"text" : "EVgo Charging Station" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
},
"evChargeOptions" : {
"connectorCount" : 16 ,
"connectorAggregation" : [
{
"type" : "EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_CHADEMO" ,
"maxChargeRateKw" : 100 ,
"count" : 8 ,
"availableCount" : 5 ,
"outOfServiceCount" : 0 ,
"availabilityLastUpdateTime" : "2024-01-10T19:10:00Z"
},
{

Search for service area businesses
Use the includePureServiceAreaBusinesses parameter to search for
businesses without a physical service address (for example, a mobile cleaning
service or a food truck).
The following example shows a request for plumbers in San Francisco:
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery" : "plumber San Francisco",
"includePureServiceAreaBusinesses": true
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
In the response, businesses without a physical service address don't include
the formattedAddress field:
{
"places" : [
{
"formattedAddress" : "3450 Sacramento St #204, San Francisco, CA 94118, USA" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Advanced Plumbing & Drain" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
{
"formattedAddress" : "1455 Bancroft Ave, San Francisco, CA 94124, USA" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Magic Plumbing Heating & Cooling" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
/.../
{
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Starboy Plumbing Inc." ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
{

"displayName" : {
"text" : "Cabrillo Plumbing, Heating & Air" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
{
"formattedAddress" : "540 Barneveld Ave # D, San Francisco, CA 94124, USA" ,
"displayName" : {
"text" : "Mr. Rooter Plumbing of San Francisco" ,
"languageCode" : "en"
}
},
/.../
{

}
},
/.../
]
}
Specify a number of results to return per page
Use the pageSize parameter to specify a number of results to
return per page. The nextPageToken parameter in the response body
provides a token that can be used in subsequent calls to access the next page of
results.
The following example shows a request for "pizza in New York" limited to 5
results per page:
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery": "pizza in New York",
"pageSize": 5
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H "X-Goog-FieldMask: places.id, nextPageToken " \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
{
"places" : [
{
"id" : "ChIJifIePKtZwokRVZ-UdRGkZzs"
},
{
"id" : "ChIJPxPd_P1YwokRfzLhSiACEoU"
},
{
"id" : "ChIJrXXKn5NZwokR78g0ipCnY60"
},
{
"id" : "ChIJ6ySICVZYwokR9rIK8HjXhzE"
},
{
"id" : "ChIJ6xvs94VZwokRnT1D2lX2OTw"
}
],
"nextPageToken" : "AeCrKXsZWzNVbPzO-MRWPu52jWO_Xx8aKwOQ69_Je3DxRpfdjClq8Ekwh3UcF2h2Jn75kL6PtWLGV4ecQri-GEUKN_OFpJkdVc-JL4Q"
}
To access the next page of results, use pageToken to pass in the
nextPageToken in the request body:
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery": "pizza in New York",
"pageSize": 5,
"pageToken": "AeCrKXsZWzNVbPzO-MRWPu52jWO_Xx8aKwOQ69_Je3DxRpfdjClq8Ekwh3UcF2h2Jn75kL6PtWLGV4ecQri-GEUKN_OFpJkdVc-JL4Q"
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY ' \
-H "X-Goog-FieldMask: places.id,nextPageToken" \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
{
"places" : [
{
"id" : "ChIJL-LN1N1ZwokR8K2jACu6Ydw"
},
{
"id" : "ChIJjaD94kFZwokR-20CXqlpy_4"
},
{
"id" : "ChIJ6ffdpJNZwokRmcafdROM5q0"
},
{
"id" : "ChIJ8Q2WSpJZwokRQz-bYYgEskM"
},
{
"id" : "ChIJ8164qwFZwokRhplkmhvq1uE"
}
],
"nextPageToken" : "AeCrKXvPd6uUy-oj96W2OaqEe2pUD8QTxOM8-sKfUcFsC9t2Wey5qivrKGoGSxcZnyc7RPmaFfAktslrKbUh31ZDTkL0upRmaxA7c_c"
}
Note: All parameters other than maxResultCount , pageSize , and pageToken
must be the same as the previous request. Otherwise, the API returns an
INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
Get address descriptors
Address descriptors provide relational information about a place's location,
including nearby landmarks and containing areas.
Note: Address descriptors are generally available for customers in India and are
experimental elsewhere. Places API requests that use only addressDescriptor in
the field mask will be billed at SKU: Places API Text Search
Pro .
The following example shows a Text Search (New) request for places near a
mall in San Jose. In this example, you include addressDescriptors in the field
mask:
curl -X POST -d '{
"textQuery": "clothes",
"maxResultCount": 5,
"locationBias": {
"circle": {
"center": {
"latitude": 37.321328,
"longitude": -121.946275
}
}
},
"rankPreference":"RANK_PREFERENCE_UNSPECIFIED"
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY " \
-H "X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName, places.addressDescriptor " \
https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText
The response includes the place specified in the request, a list of nearby
landmarks and their distance from the place, and a list of areas and their
containment relationship to the place:
