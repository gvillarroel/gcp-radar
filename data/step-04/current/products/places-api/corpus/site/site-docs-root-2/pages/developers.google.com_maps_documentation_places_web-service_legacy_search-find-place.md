If your billing address is in the European Economic Area, effective on 8 July 2025, the
Google Maps Platform EEA Terms of Service
will apply to your use of the Services. Functionality varies by region.

Note: Server-side
and client-side libraries
The Places API is also available with the
Java Client,
Python Client, Go Client and Node.js Client for Google Maps Services .
The Places API and the client libraries are for
use in server applications.
If you're building a client-side
application, take a look at the
Places SDK for Android (New) , the
Places SDK for iOS (New) , and the
Places Library, Maps JavaScript API .
A Find Place (Legacy) request takes a text input and returns a place. The input
can be any kind of Places text data, such as a name, address, or phone
number. The request must be a string. A Find Place (Legacy) request using non-string data
such as a lat/lng coordinate or plus code generates an error.
A Find Place (Legacy) request returns a subset of the fields that are returned by a
Place Details (Legacy) request.
For more information on the fields that are unavailable in a Find Place (Legacy) request, see
Places API fields support .
If the field you want is not returned, you can use Find Place (Legacy) to get a place_id ,
then use that ID to make a Place Details (Legacy) request.
Find Place (Legacy) requests
A Find Place (Legacy) request is an HTTP URL of the following form:
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/ output ? parameters
where output may be either of the following values:
json (recommended) indicates output in JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON)
xml indicates output as XML
Certain parameters are required to initiate a Find Place (Legacy) request. As is
standard in URLs, all parameters are separated using the ampersand
( & ) character.
Required parameters
input
The text string on which to search, for example: "restaurant" or "123 Main
Street". This must be a place name, address, or category of
establishments. Any other types of input can generate errors and are not
guaranteed to return valid results. The Places API will return candidate
matches based on this string and order the results based on their
perceived relevance.
inputtype
The type of input. This can be one of either textquery or
phonenumber . Phone numbers must be in international format
(prefixed by a plus sign ("+"), followed by the country code, then the
phone number itself). See
E.164 ITU recommendation
for more information.
Optional parameters
fields
Caution: Place Search requests and Place Details requests don't return
the same fields. Place Search requests return a subset of the fields that
are returned by Place Details requests. If the field you want is not
returned by Place Search, you can use Place Search to get a
place_id , then use that Place ID to make a Place Details
request. For more information on the fields that are unavailable in a
Place Search request, see
Places API fields support .
Use the fields parameter to specify a comma-separated list of place data
types to return. For example:
fields=formatted_address,name,geometry . Use a forward slash
when specifying compound values. For example:
opening_hours/open_now .
Fields are divided into three billing categories:
Basic ,
Contact , and
Atmosphere .
Basic fields are billed at base rate, and Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a higher
rate. Basic, Contact, and Atmosphere SKUs are charged in addition to the base SKU (Places
Details, Find Place, Nearby Search, or Text Search) for the request that triggered them. For
more information, see the
pricing sheet .
Basic
The Basic category includes the following fields:
address_components , adr_address ,
business_status , formatted_address ,
geometry , icon , icon_mask_base_uri ,
icon_background_color , name ,
permanently_closed ( deprecated ), photo , place_id , plus_code ,
type , url , utc_offset ,
vicinity , wheelchair_accessible_entrance .
Contact
The Contact category includes the following fields:
current_opening_hours , formatted_phone_number ,
international_phone_number , opening_hours ,
secondary_opening_hours , website
Atmosphere
The Atmosphere category includes the following fields:
curbside_pickup , delivery , dine_in ,
editorial_summary , price_level ,
rating , reservable , reviews ,
serves_beer , serves_breakfast ,
serves_brunch , serves_dinner ,
serves_lunch , serves_vegetarian_food ,
serves_wine , takeout ,
user_ratings_total .
Note: Attributions, html_attributions , are
always returned with every call, regardless of whether the field has been
requested.
language
The language in which to return results.
See the
list of supported languages . Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
exhaustive.
If language is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
preferred language as specified in the
Accept-Language header.
The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
component.
If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
closest match.
The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
valid in one language but not in another. For example, utca and
tér are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
locationbias
Prefer results in a specified area, by specifying either a radius plus
lat/lng, or two lat/lng pairs representing the points of a rectangle. If
this parameter is not specified, the API uses IP address biasing by
default.
IP bias: Instructs the API to use IP address biasing. Pass the string
ipbias (this option has no additional parameters).
Circular: A string specifying radius in meters, plus lat/lng in decimal
degrees. Use the following format: circle:radius@lat,lng .
Rectangular: A string specifying two lat/lng pairs in decimal degrees,
representing the south/west and north/east points of a rectangle. Use
the following format: rectangle:south,west|north,east . Note
that east/west values are wrapped to the range -180, 180, and
north/south values are clamped to the range -90, 90.
Note: If you omit the fields parameter
from a Find Place (Legacy) request, only the place_id for the result will
be returned.
Find Place (Legacy) examples
The following example shows a Find Place (Legacy) request for "Museum of Contemporary
Art Australia", including the photos ,
formatted_address , name , rating ,
opening_hours , and geometry fields:
curl
curl -L -X GET 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/json?input=Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%20Australia&inputtype=textquery&fields=formatted_address%2Cname%2Crating%2Copening_hours%2Cgeometry&key=YOUR_API_KEY'
HTTP
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/json
?fields=formatted_address%2Cname%2Crating%2Copening_hours%2Cgeometry
&input=Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%20Australia
&inputtype=textquery
&key=YOUR_API_KEY
The following example shows a Find Place (Legacy) request for "Mongolian Grill",
using the locationbias parameter to prefer results within
2000 meters of the specified coordinates:
curl
curl -L -X GET 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/json?input=Mongolian%20Grill&inputtype=textquery&fields=formatted_address%2Cname%2Crating%2Copening_hours%2Cgeometry&locationbias=circle:2000@−33.866,151.216&key=YOUR_API_KEY'
HTTP
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/json
?fields=formatted_address%2Cname%2Crating%2Copening_hours%2Cgeometry
&input=Mongolian%20Grill
&inputtype=textquery
&locationbias=circle:2000@−33.866,151.216
&key=YOUR_API_KEY
The following example shows a Find Place (Legacy) request for a phone number. Note that the international
call prefix "+" has been encoded to %2B so that this request is a compliant URL.
Left unencoded, the + prefix would be decoded to a space on the server, resulting in an invalid
phone number lookup.
curl
curl -L -X GET 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/json?input=%2B16502530000&inputtype=phonenumber&fields=formatted_address%2Cname%2Crating%2Copening_hours%2Cgeometry&key=YOUR_API_KEY'
