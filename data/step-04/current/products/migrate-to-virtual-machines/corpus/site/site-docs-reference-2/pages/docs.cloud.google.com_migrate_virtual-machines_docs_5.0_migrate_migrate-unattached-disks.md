Migrate to Virtual Machines lets you migrate unattached disks from an
AWS source to Persistent Disk volumes on Google Cloud. This feature is useful
when you want to migrate your unattached disks, that is, disks that are not
connected to any virtual machine (VM) instance to Google Cloud.
Before you begin
Before you begin the migration process, do the following:
Enable Migrate to Virtual Machines services
to configure the migration environment on your migration source and migration target .
Create an AWS IAM policy with ec2:CreateSnapshot by ensuring that you add ec2:CreateSnapshot to the referenced
policy.
Limitations
The following limitations apply:
You can only migrate disks from AWS sources.
Regional disks and hyperdisk disks are not supported.
Disk migration process
To migrate unattached disks to Google Cloud, use the following steps:
Console
To migrate unattached disks by using the Google Cloud console, use the following
steps.
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Sources tab.
From the source drop-down list, select the migration source from which you
want to migrate disks.
Note: You can migrate unnattached disks only from AWS sources.
Below the drop-down you see the Source status of the migration source
as follows:
Active : the source is active and connected to Migrate to Virtual Machines.
Offline : the source is unavailable.
Pending : the source is in the process of being connected and verified.
If you don't see any entries in the drop-down list, it indicates that you
haven't configured the migration source properly. Review the steps for
your migration source settings and try again.
If the source is Active , the Source disks tab displays all the
source disks in the migration source available for migration. Select one
or more source disks.
Click Migration . The Create disk migrations page appears.
Provide the details required for the disk migration. The following table
describes these fields detail.
Field name
Description
Disk name
Enter a name for the migrated disk. For more information on the naming
rules, see Naming convention .
Target project
The target project in which you want to create the migrated disk. If
you've not already added a target project, do so using the instructions given in
Add a target project .
Zone
Select the zone in which you want to create the migrated disk. See
Regions and Zones .
Disk type
Select the type of disk. See
Persistent Disk types .
Labels
To organize your project, add labels as key-value pairs to your
resources. See Organize resources using labels .
You can now do one of the following:
Click Create to create the migration. Creating a migration only
onboards the disk, however, the disk is not migrated yet. This migration
appears in the Disk migrations tab. To run the migration, go to the
Disk migrations tab, select the disk migration you want to run, and
click Run .
Click Create and run to create the migration and start the
migration immediately.
After the migration completes, the status of the migration is displayed in
the Disk migrations tab.
gcloud
To migrate unattached disks by using the Google Cloud CLI, run the following
command.
gcloud alpha compute migration disk-migrations create DISK_MIGRATION_JOB_NAME \
--source= AWS_SOURCE_NAME \
--source-volume-id= AWS_VOLUME_ID \
--location= REGION_ID \
--target-project= TARGET_PROJECT_RESOURCE_PATH
Replace the following:
DISK_MIGRATION_JOB_NAME : the name of the unnattached
disk you want to migrate. For more information on the naming rules, see
Naming convention .
AWS_SOURCE_NAME : the AWS source from which you want
to import the unnattached disk.
AWS_VOLUME_ID : the ID of the AWS volume that you
want to migrate to Google Cloud.
REGION_ID : the region to which you want to migrate
the unnattached disk to.
TARGET_PROJECT : the target project to which you
want to migrate the unnattached disk. If you've not already added a target
project, do so using the instructions given in Add a target project .
For more information, see gcloud alpha compute migration disk-migrations create .
REST API
To migrate unattached by using the REST API, complete the following steps.
In the Cloud Shell terminal, define a shell alias for calling Google
REST APIs:
alias gcurl='curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json"'
Create a disk migration job using the following REST command:
gcurl https://vmmigration.googleapis.com/v1alpha1/projects/ HOST_PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /sources/ M2VM_SOURCE /diskMigrationJobs/?disk_migration_job_id= DISK_MIGRATION_JOB -X POST --data '{
