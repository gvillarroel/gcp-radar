User data deletion

This document gives you an overview of how Migrate to Virtual Machines handles the
deletion of your data stored in Google Cloud while migrating your virtual
machine (VM) instances using Migrate to Virtual Machines.
The deletion of your data begins when you perform one of the following actions:
Disable the Migrate to Virtual Machines API or delete your Google Cloud project:
You can shut down projects
using the Google Cloud console or the projects.delete
method in the API. A project must have a lifecycle state of ACTIVE to be
shut down in this way.
This method immediately marks a project to be deleted. A notification email is sent to the user who initiated the delete operation and the Technical
category contacts that are listed in
Essential Contacts on a best effort basis; if the notification fails to send, the project is still marked to be deleted. If there's no contact in the Technical category, the fallback contact isn't notified.
Note: If a third-party user initiates project deletion, then the email notification isn't sent to the contacts that are listed in Essential Contacts .
A project that is marked for deletion isn't usable. If the project
has a billing account associated with it, that association is broken and isn't
reinstated if the project delete operation is canceled. After 30 days, the
project is fully deleted. Until it is fully deleted, the project might still be
visible, although it isn't usable.
To stop the project delete process during the 30-day period, see the
steps to restore a project .
Warning: You can recover most resources
if you restore a project within the 30-day period. Some services have delays
in restoring and you might need to wait some time for services to be restored.
Some resources, such as Cloud Storage or Pub/Sub resources, are deleted
much sooner. These resources might not be fully recoverable even if you
restore the project within the 30-day period. In some cases,
projects may continue to incur charges for a period of time after shutdown.
To avoid unexpected charges,
disable billing before shutting down the project. The billing account must
be manually linked again after the project is restored.
At the end of the 30-day period, the project and all of its resources
are deleted and cannot be recovered. Until it is deleted, the project counts
towards your project quota.
Delete your Google account: When a Google Account is closed, Google Cloud
may impose an internal recovery period up to 30 days, depending on past account
activity. After that grace period expires, a signal containing the deleted
billing account user_id is broadcasted to Google products and
Google Cloud resources tied solely to that user_id are marked for
deletion.
For an overview of the secure process that occurs when you delete your data, see
Data deletion on Google Cloud .
