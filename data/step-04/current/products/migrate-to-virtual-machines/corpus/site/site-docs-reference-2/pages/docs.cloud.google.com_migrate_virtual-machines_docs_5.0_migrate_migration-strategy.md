Image import versus machine image import

Migrating virtual disks or virtual machine (VM) instances to Google Cloud requires choosing the right import strategy based on your needs—whether you need to migrate specific data or operating system components, or replicate entire VM
configurations across different projects. Migrate to Virtual Machines offers two
primary methods for migrating VM images to Google Cloud: image import and machine image import . This document compares these two methods to help you
choose the right strategy for your migration.
Image import and machine image import
Cloud migration often involves more than transferring data: it requires a
strategic approach. Before migrating, you must consider the following key aspects:
The best method to transfer curated OS images with embedded configurations.
How to ensure consistency across scaled environments.
The optimal approach for migrating images versus complex, multi-disk
virtual machines.
Migrate to Virtual Machines offers two primary methods for migrating VM images to Google Cloud: image import and machine image import .
Image import: This method lets you import individual disks, typically OS
or data volumes, into Google Cloud. It is ideal for rebuilding or
maintaining golden images, especially when the goal is to replicate a clean,
consistent base configuration across multiple instances. For information on
importing an image, see Import images .
Machine image import: This more comprehensive solution captures the entire
VM state, including multiple disks, configuration metadata, networking, and
startup scripts. It is particularly suited for migrating complex workloads
that require end-to-end replication. For information on
importing a machine image, see Import machine images .
Both options are valuable and their applicability depends on the workload you
are migrating. The following table highlights the differences, advantages, and
ideal use cases for each method.
Feature
Image Import
Machine Image Import
Focus
Individual disks (OS or data volumes)
Entire VM configuration (multiple disks and metadata)
Use cases
The ideal use cases for image import are:
Creating golden images for consistent environments
Migrating database data disks
Offline migration of specific workloads
Replicating consistent environments
Migrating applications with specific OS needs
Bringing data to Google Cloud with precise data state preservation
The ideal use cases for machine image import are:
Deploying a consistent environment such as golden images
Migrating complex web applications such as a single VM with a complex disk
setup, or a group of VMs
Preparing for disaster recovery
Migrating complex applications with dependencies and networking
Migrating offline with minimal downtime
Replicating for testing and disaster recovery
Advantages
The advantages of image import are:
Efficiency : Fast and reliable for migrating large volumes of data.
Accuracy : Preserves the exact file system structure of the source
system.
Consistency : Ideal for creating clones of systems for redundancy
or scaling.
The advantages of machine image import are:
Easy versioning : Keep your images organized and trackable with
seamless image versioning management.
Support for multiple disks : Can hold multiple disks.
Quick recovery : As machine images save the entire VM, you don't
need to perform manual configuration after import.
Cost-effective : Saves the time of setting up VMs and benefits
from Compute Engine's compressed, affordable storage.
Consistency : Deploy multiple VMs with the same configuration for
standardization across your projects.
Secure and flexible : Supports encrypted transfers, custom OS
support, and hybrid cloud compatibility.
Automation ready : Integrate image imports into development and
operations (DevOps) workflows or infrastructure-as-code (IaaS) tools like
Terraform.

Choose the right migration strategy
Cloud migration isn't a one-size-fits-all process. Whether you choose image
import or machine image import depends on your specific infrastructure,
workload, and migration goals.
Image import
When you need to migrate individual disks containing either data or operating
systems, image import is the preferred option. Consider it as moving specific
building blocks of your IT infrastructure. Here are some practical examples:
Create a golden image for development and production environments: your
development team might require a standardized environment with a specific
operating system configuration and pre-installed software. You can create a
image of a perfectly configured operating system along with auxiliary packages
and use it as a template. Each developer can then create a new VM instance
using this image, ensuring consistency, security, and saving setup time.
Migrate a database's data disks to the cloud: if you have a large database
on a physical server, you can create a image of the database's data disks an
import it into Google Cloud, preserving the data's integrity.
Perform an offline migration of specific workloads: for physical servers
that cannot be migrated directly, you can create a local image of the workload
and then import it to Compute Engine.
Machine image import
Machine image import takes a holistic approach, capturing the entire VM
configuration, including multiple disks, metadata, and permissions. This makes
it ideal for scenarios where preserving the interdependencies between components
is crucial. Here are some practical examples:
Deploy a consistent environment: replicate entire VM configurations across
different projects, commonly referred to as golden images.
Migrate complex web applications: machine image import lets you migrate
an application, whether it is a single virtual machine that has a complex disk
setup with the operating system and application installed, or it can be a
group of VMs along with other infrastructure services. For example, consider
a web application that requires a particular web server setup, a database, and specialized software libraries.
Prepare for disaster recovery: Machine image import is a valuable tool for
low-scale disaster recovery or archiving up to two application configurations.
By creating a machine image of your critical servers, you have a readily
available backup that can be quickly deployed in case of a system failure.
This minimizes downtime and ensures business continuity.
Key decision factors
When choosing between image import and machine image import, consider the
following:
Configuration complexity: if your workload involves intricate dependencies
or specific hardware requirements, machine image import is the recommended
approach.
Granularity: if you only need to migrate specific data or operating system
components, image import provides the necessary granularity.
Google Cloud's migration tools are powerful, but they're most effective
when you understand their strengths and limitations. Take the time to plan,
test, and execute your cloud migrations.
