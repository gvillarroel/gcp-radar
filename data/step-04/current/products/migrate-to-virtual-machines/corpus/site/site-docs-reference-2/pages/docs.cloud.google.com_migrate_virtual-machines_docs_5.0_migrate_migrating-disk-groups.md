Migrate disks in groups
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Use groups to perform bulk disk migration tasks on multiple VMs simultaneously.
Groups streamline the process of planning and migrating disks of multiple VMs
so that you can perform migration in batches. You can also create new VM
instances and attach the migrated Persistent Disk volumes to them.
The migration process for groups uses the same phases as for an individual VM:
Onboard
Replicate
Set VM target details
Test-clone (optional)
Cut-over
Finalize
With groups, before you start replication you first add one or more source VMs
to a group. You then perform the migration on the entire group, or on a subset
of VMs in the group.
The disk migration process follows the same steps as the VM migration
process. Therefore, you can choose to switch from VM migration to disk migration
and the other way around at any point during the migration process. For more
information, see Switch from disk migration to VM migration .
Note: You can migrate your VM's boot disk as a data disk using the disk migration
process in cases where OS adaptation is not needed. In case you want to migrate
the boot disk with the OS (to be able to use it as a boot disk), then VM migration is more suitable.
Prerequisites
Perform the following steps to configure the migration environment on the your
migration source
and migration target .
Enable Migrate to Virtual Machines services .
(Only for VMware VM migration) Install the Migrate Connector .
Options for configuring groups
While you typically perform operations on an entire group (such as starting
replication) you can also perform any operation on a specific VM or subset of
VMs in the group. For example, when configuring the target details, some or all
of the VMs in the group might have specific requirements (such as project or
disk type) that don't apply to other VMs.
When configuring the target for a migration, you can:
Select the entire group to configure the target for all VMs. You can
later modify the target configuration for a subset of VMs or for an
individual VM.
Select a subset of VMs in the group and configure the target for those
VMs. You can later modify the target configuration for an individual VM.
Select an individual VM in the group and configure the target just for
that VM.
Step 1: Onboard VMs in a group
A group is a logical collection of one or more VMs. Groups have the following
characteristics:
All source VMs in the group must be from the same source.
A source VM can belong to one group or to no groups. That is, a VM cannot be
a member of multiple groups.
You can perform operations on all source VMs in a group, or on a subset of
VMs in the group.
You can configure the target's characteristics for the entire
group, and then override them for individual source VMs in the group.
A group name can contain only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers, and hyphens.
The name must start with a lowercase letter, and end with a lowercase letter
or a number.
You can have up to 200 migrations in progress at a time (excluding migrations
in the Finalize phase).
To onboard VMs in a group, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Sources tab.
From the drop-down list, select the migration source from which you want to
migrate a VM.
Below the drop-down you see the status of the migration source as:
Active : The source is active and connected to Migrate to Virtual Machines.
Offline : The source is unavailable.
Pending : The source is in the process of being connected and verified.
If you don't see any entries in the drop-down list, it indicates that you have
not configured the migration source properly. Review the steps for your
setting your migration source and try again.
A table appears showing the source VMs in the migration source available for
migration. Select the source VMs you want to add to a group.
The VM Power Status column shows the status as Suspended ,
On , or Off . You can add a VM with any of these statuses to a group.
Select Add to group .
In the dialog, either specify the name of a new group or select the name of
an existing group.
Select Add to Group . The group name for each VM appears under the
Migration group column.
The Migration status column for each VM displays one of the
following:
Pending : VM is in the process of being onboarded.
Ready : VM is onboarded but not yet replicating.
You can now start replication of the VMs as described in the next section.
Step 2: Start replication for a group
The first phase of migration is to start replicating the disk data from the
source VMs to Google Cloud. This is a continuous process that takes place
in the background.
Data replication is comprised of two steps:
First replication step : Migrate to Virtual Machines creates the initial
snapshot of the source VM data disks and replicates the snapshot data to
Google Cloud. Depending on the amount of disk data on the source VM,
the first replication can take minutes or hours to complete.
The Replication status column of a VM on the first replication step
displays the First sync status followed by the appropriate sub-step.
Incremental replication step : Following a successful first replication
step, incremental replication steps occur at set time intervals (every two
hours by default). In each step, a new snapshot is created for each data disk.
Only data updates that occurred after the previous step are replicated to
Google Cloud using the Change Block Tracking (CBT) mechanism.
The Replication status column of a VM on an incremental replication step
displays the Active status followed by the appropriate sub-step.
Initiate replication for a group
To initiate replication for a group, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Groups tab. You should see a list of all VM groups.
If you don't see any entries in the table, it means you have not yet
created any groups. See Onboard VMs in a group for
the procedure on creating a group.
Select the group name from the list. A table appears showing the source VMs
in the group.
Start replication:
To replicate all VMs in the group , from the Migration drop-down,
select Start Replication under All migrations in group .
To replicate a subset of VMs , select the required VMs and then
from the Migration drop-down, select Start Replication under
Selected migrations .
Starting the migration initiates the replication phase of migration.
The Replication status column for a VM displays one of the following:
First sync : VM is performing the first replication step.
Active (Current cycle: XX%) : VM has performed XX% percent of the
current replication step.
Active (Idle) : VM is idle between replication steps.
To view the replication history of a VM, click the VM to open the details
page. Click Replication History to view the replication history of the VM
along with the sub-steps of the replication .
Note: Migrate to Virtual Machines saves and displays up to 100 cycles of
replication history for a VM.
You can now configure group targets for the
test-clone and cut-over phases.
You can also set the migration interval. For more information, see
Set the replication interval .
Switch from disk migration to VM migration
You can switch between disk migration and VM migration at any time during the
migration process. Note that you cannot switch the migration type of a VM that
belongs to a group. You must remove the VM from the group and then convert the
migration from disk migration to VM migration.
To switch from disk migration to VM migration, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Groups tab. You should see a list of all VM groups.
Remove VMs for which you want to change the migration type from the group:
To remove all VMs from the group , from the Group Assignment drop-down,
select Move to group or Remove from group under All migrations
in group .
To remove a subset of VMs , select the required VMs and then
from the Group Assignment drop-down select Move to group or
Remove from group under Selected migrations .
The VMs that you have removed from the group should appear in the
Disk Migrations tab.
Select the Disk Migrations tab.
Select one or more VMs.
Click Migration > Convert to VM migration .
Switching from disk migration to VM migration clears out the target details.
This is because the target details for disk migration and VM migration are
different. However, the replication progress isn't lost during the switch.
You must update the target details before you clone or cut-over
operations on your VM in order for the migration to succeed. For more
information, see Configure group targets .
Step 3: Configure group targets
Migrate to Virtual Machines lets you migrate the disks of a source VM to Persistent Disk
volumes on Google Cloud with the following options:
Migrate the disks to Persistent Disk volumes
Migrate the disks to Persistent Disk volumes and attach them to a new VM instance
You must configure the target details such as project, zone, disk type, and more
based on the option you choose. The target project is the project that contains
the Persistent Disk volumes migrated from the source VM, or the newly created VM
instances to which you want to attach the migrated Persistent Disk volumes. You can
modify the target details at any time. When you create a test-clone or cut-over,
Migrate to Virtual Machines uses the target details settings at the time of the
operation.
The host project
is automatically added as a target project so there is no need to explicitly add
it. If you want to add an additional project as a target project, see
Adding a target project .
To configure the Persistent Disk target, follow these steps:
If you have not done so already, add the target project as shown in
Adding a target .
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Groups tab.
A table of available groups appears.
Select a group.
Select the VMs in the group to configure:
Select the checkbox for an individual VM.
Select the checkbox for multiple VMs.
Select the checkbox in the top row of the table to select all the visible
rows in the table.
Note: This action does not select the rows that are not visible.
When you select the checkbox in the top row of a table when some rows are not
visible, a prompt appears in the top row asking if you want to select all
rows in the table.
Click Edit Target Details . A panel opens to let you configure
the Target Details for the selected VMs.
On the panel, setting most options applies that option to all selected VMs.
However, some settings are specific to the VMs and you can set them individually.
If you are configuring multiple VMs, you set these options individually for
each VM:
(Required) : The Persistent Disk volume Name .
(Optional) : The External IP and Internal IP addresses of the
Persistent Disk volume.
Set the Target details that define the characteristics of the Persistent Disk
volumes to which you want to migrate your data. The following table lists those
settings in detail.
You can select the checkbox next to each disk indicating whether or not it
should be created in the target project when the VM is cloned or cut over.
Section title
Field name
Description
General
Project
The name of the project hosting the Persistent Disk volumes. It must be a project you have already added earlier in this section.
Zone
Zone for the Persistent Disk volumes. See
Regions and Zones .
Disk Configuration
Name
Enter a name for the disk.
Disk Type
Select the type of Persistent Disk. See
Persistent Disk types .
Labels
To organize your project, add labels as key/value pairs to your resources.
See
Labeling resources .
Attach to a VM
Attach disks to VM
Select Don't attach to a VM if you don't want to attach
the Persistent Disk volumes to a VM instance.
Select Create a VM from a disk image if you want to create a
VM instance and attach the Persistent Disk volumes to it. If you choose this
option, you must set the target details that define the attributes of the new
VM instance to which you want to attach the migrated Persistent Disk volumes. For
more information on these settings, see Configure the target for a VM .
Replication Policy
Replication idle duration between cycles
By default, Migrate to Virtual Machines performs a replication of the source VM every 2 hours.
Set the replication frequency (in seconds).
Note: The replication cycle idle time counter starts after the previous replication cycle ends.
Click Save .
(Optional) Step 4: Test a clone of disks in a group
In the test-clone phase, you can check if the Persistent Disk volumes created during
the replication phase are functioning as expected. For example, you can attach
the migrated Persistent Disk volumes to a Compute Engine instance in your target
environment to check if the disks are working as expected.
If you have created a new VM instance and attached the migrated Persistent Disk
volumes to it, Migrate to Virtual Machines deploys a clone of the VM instance to a
Compute Engine instance in your target environment to test it. While the
testing phase is optional, it is best practice to perform testing before you
perform a cut-over to the migrated disk.
Each time you create a test-clone instance, it is cloned from the most recently
completed replication cycle data using the current target details. In other
words, a test-clone instance represents a snapshot of the source VM at the
time of the last completed replication cycle.
Caution: New replication data and modifications to the target details are only
applied to new test-clones, not to existing test-clones.
You can test a VM in the Paused state if it has completed at least one
replication.
Test a group
To test a group, follow these steps:
Ensure that you have configured a target environment as shown in
Configure group targets .
Note: You can only test-clone VMs with a valid target environment.
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Groups tab.
A table of available VM groups appears.
Select a group.
A table of available source VMs appears. You can test any VM that is in the
Active (Current cycle: XX%) or Active (Idle) state.
The Active state means the first replication sync of the VM succeeded.
Select the VMs in the group to test:
For all VMs in the group, from the Cut-Over and Test-Clone drop-down,
select Test-clone under All migrations in group .
Any VMs without a valid target environment,
and any VMs not in the Active (Current cycle: XX%)
or Active (Idle) state, are ignored.
For one or more selected VMs, from the Cut-Over and Test-Clone drop-down,
select Test-clone under Selected migrations .
All selected VMs must have a valid target environment and be in the
Active (Current cycle: XX%) or Active (Idle) state.
The Test-Clone/Cut-Over status column shows the status of the
operation along with one of the sub-steps detailed in the
test-clone sub-steps table .
Wait for the Test-Clone/Cut-Over status column to show Succeeded .
This indicates that the clone was created successfully.
You can view the test-clone history of a VM in one of the following ways:
Click the Info panel icon, , for the VM. On the panel that opens from the right, the
Monitoring tab displays the history, including the name of each
test-clone instance.
Click the VM to open the details page. Click Test-Clone/Cut-Over History
to view the test-clone history of the VM along with the sub-steps of the test-clone .
You can cancel an active test-clone operation by selecting a VM and then
clicking Cancel Test-Clone from the Cut-Over and Test-Clone drop-down.
You can now create VM instance(s) and attach the test-clone disks to it to
check if the migrated disks are working as expected.
After you have completed testing, delete the VM instance(s) to free up
resources so that you are no longer charged for the instance.
Manage multiple test-clones
Over the duration of your migration journey, you might create multiple test-clones.
For example, you create the first test-clone after the initial replication cycle.
Then, as you refine your migration, you create new test-clones. For information
on managing multiple test clones, see Manage multiple test clones .
Step 5: Cut-over a group
In the cut-over phase, you transfer control to your migrated disk, or the new VM
you created with the migrated Persistent Disk volumes attached to it, in your target
environment on Google Cloud.
The cut-over process does the following:
If data replication is active, that is, the Replication status
of a VM is Active (Current cycle: XX%) , waits for it to complete.
Shuts down the source VMs.
Performs the final data replication. Because replication occurs throughout all
migration phases, the amount of data to replicate shouldn't be very large.
Note: To perform cut-over, replication cannot be paused on a VM.
Stops replication.
Creates the Persistent Disk volumes from the final replicated data.
Note: You must have already configured the Persistent Disk target details
before you can initiate a cut-over. For more information, see
Configure group targets .
The cut-over phase includes a short VM downtime and should take place during a
scheduled maintenance window. You must determine the maintenance window during
which you can stop the source VM and redirect traffic to the migrated disk.
Create a cut-over
To create a cut-over, follow these steps:
Ensure that you have configured a production VM target environment as shown
in Configure group targets . If the target details were
previously configured for test-clone operation, you might want to edit the
target details to point to a new target.
Note: You can only cut-over VMs with a valid target environment.
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Groups tab.
A table of available groups appears.
Select a group.
A table of available source VMs appears. You can cut-over any VM that is in
the Active (Current cycle: XX%) or Active (Idle) state.
The Active state means the first replication sync of the VM succeeded.
You can also cut-over a VM that has already been cut-over and is
in the Cut-over state. Select the individual VM or multiple VMs in the
table to perform the cut-over. However, selecting Cut-Over for the
entire group only performs a cut-over on Active or Active (Idle) VMs.
Select the VMs in the group to cut-over:
For all VMs in the group, from the Cut-Over and Test-Clone drop-down,
select Cut-Over under All migrations in group . Any VMs without a
valid target environment, and any VMs not in the
Active (Current cycle: XX%) or Active (Idle) state, are ignored.
For one or more selected VMs, from the Cut-Over and Test-Clone
drop-down, select Cut-Over under Selected migrations . All
selected VMs must have a valid target environment and be in the
Active (Current cycle: XX%) or Active (Idle) state.
The Test-Clone/Cut-Over status column shows the status of the
operation along with one of the sub-steps detailed in the cut-over sub-steps table .
Migrate to Virtual Machines performs the following actions when you initiate a
cut-over:
If data replication is active, waits for it to complete.
Shuts down the source VM.
Performs the final data replication cycle. Because continuous replication
occurs throughout all migration phases, the amount of data to replicate
shouldn't be very large.
Creates the Persistent Disk volumes hosting the migrated VM from the final
replicated data.
Stops data replication.
Wait for the Test-Clone/Cut-Over status column to show Succeeded . This
indicates that the cut-over was created successfully.
You can view the cut-over history of a VM in one of the following ways:
Click the Info panel icon, , for the VM. On the panel that opens from the right, the Monitoring
tab displays the history, including the name of each cut-over instance.
Click the VM to open the details page. Click Test-Clone/Cut-Over History
to view the cut-over history of the VM along with the sub-steps of the cut-over .
You can cancel an active cut-over operation by selecting a VM and
clicking Cancel Cut-Over from the Cut-Over and Test-Clone drop-down.
Perform validation test on the VM.
Retry cut-over
If for any reason you want to retry cut-over, follow these steps:
Select a VM in the Cut-Over state.
Select Migration > Resume Replication .
Retry cut-over.
Roll back from the cut-over
To rollback from cut-over, perform the following steps:
Cut-over stops the original source VM in your migration source, so you must
start it and redirect traffic back to the source VM.
If necessary, copy new data created on the Persistent Disk volumes so that you
can write it to the source VM.
(Optional) Delete Persistent Disk volumes.
Resume replication on the source VM. Replication resumes
from the last snapshot taken.
Retry cut-over.
Step 6: Finalize a migration
The replication data used to create Persistent Disk volumes is retained after cut-over
to allow you to resume replication from the last replication snapshot.
However, you are charged for the storage used by the replication data until you
delete it in the finalize phase. Finalizing deletes all replication data and
storage resources.
The Finalize phase does not delete Persistent Disk volumes. If you created
Persistent Disk volumes during the testing phase, you must manually delete them. You
are charged for those test-clone Persistent Disk volumes until they are deleted.
To finalize a migration, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Groups tab.
A table of available groups appears.
Select a group.
A table of available source VMs appears.
Select the VMs in the group to finalize:
Select an individual VM. If the VM is in the Cut-Over state then the
Finalize button is enabled.
Select multiple VMs in the group. If all selected VMs are in the Cut-Over
state then the Finalize button is enabled.
To finalize all VMs in the group, from the Group Operations drop-down,
select Finalize . Any VMs not in the Cut-Over state are ignored.
Click Finalize and then confirm the finalize.
After finalize phase completes, the state of the VM is set to Finalized .
The only allowed operations on a migration in the Finalized state are:
Delete the migration
Add to or remove from a group
Remove a VM from a group
When you remove a VM from a group, you can either move it to another group or
remove it from all groups.
After removing a VM from a group, you can still manage its migration from the
Disk Migrations tab.
To remove a VM from a group, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Groups tab.
Select a group.
Remove VMs:
To remove all VMs from the group , from the Group Assignment
drop-down, select Move to group or Remove from group under
All migrations in group .
To remove a subset of VMs , select the required VMs and then
from the Group Assignment drop-down select Move to group or
Remove from group under Selected migrations .
Delete a group migration or a group
You can delete a group or a migration associated with a VM in a group.
Deleting a group has no effect on the individual VMs in the group.
When you delete the group, all migration information for the individual VMs
is retained and you can continue with migrating the individual VMs.
Deleting a migrating VM removes:
The replication data for the VM stored on Google Cloud
The Persistent Disk configuration information
The monitoring history
All other data associated with migrating the VM
The VM from the list of onboarded VMs on the Groups and Migrations tabs
The VM from its group
However, deleting a migration does not remove the source VM from the list of
available VMs for the migration source displayed on the Sources tab.
That is, only the migration data for the VM is deleted. The original source VM
itself is not affected when you delete a migration. That means you can later
onboard the source VM again to migrate it.
To delete a group, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Groups tab.
A table of available groups appears.
Select the checkbox in the table for the group.
Click Delete and then confirm the deletion.
To delete the migration associated with one or more group VMs:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Groups tab.
Select a group.
Select the checkbox for one or more VMs in the group.
Click Delete and then confirm the deletion.
