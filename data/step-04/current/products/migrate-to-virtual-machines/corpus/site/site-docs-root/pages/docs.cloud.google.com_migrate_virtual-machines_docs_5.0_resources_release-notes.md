EL 8 and 9.
August 25, 2025
Feature
Generally available: The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) to Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) conversion option is now generally available. Migrate to Virtual Machines lets you convert the OS boot type of a VM instance from BIOS to UEFI. This option is useful when you want to securely boot your VM instance, as secure boot is only supported by UEFI. For more information, see the table in Configure the target for a migrated VM .

May 07, 2025
Feature
Migrate to Virtual Machines now introduces an expiration time for a migrating VM. A migrating VM is a VM that you create during the migration process to migrate your workloads to Google Cloud.
A migrating VM stays active for 100 days from the time that the VM appears in the VM Migrations tab. After 100 days, the VM is moved to the EXPIRED state and stays in the EXPIRED state for 30 days. If you need more time to complete your migration, you can extend the lifespan of the migrating VM by an additional 100 days. You can only extend the lifespan of a migrating VM two weeks before the VM expires and throughout the expiration period (between 86 to 130 days from the creation of the VM). If you don't extend the lifespan of the VM during this period, the VM expires.

Feature
Migrate to Virtual Machines supports importing Arm disk images to Google Cloud. For information on operating systems supporting this feature, see Supported operating systems .
March 19, 2025
Feature
Generally available: Migrate to Virtual Machines support for the Arm64 migration journey is now generally available. This feature lets you migrate Arm virtual machine (VM) instances from AWS and Azure cloud services to Arm VM instances on Compute Engine, and it is supported for the following operating systems:

March 12, 2025
Feature
Experimental: Migrate to Virtual Machines now supports the migration of VM instances running Amazon Linux 2 to Rocky Linux 8 as part of an open access experimental program. In order to migrate a VM running Amazon Linux 2, Migrate to Virtual Machines first converts Amazon Linux 2 to Rocky Linux 8, and then completes the migration.
Note: Some VM instances can't be automatically converted from Amazon Linux 2 to Rocky Linux 8. In such cases, we recommend that you use the VM Disk Migration feature to first migrate your VM's disks to Google Cloud. You can then rebuild the VM instances using a Google Cloud OS image and the migrated disks.
November 14, 2024
Feature
Preview: Migrate to Virtual Machines lets you migrate Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes not attached to a VM from AWS to Google Cloud , as part of a preview program.

September 16, 2024
Change
As Container Registry is deprecated , Migrate to Virtual Machines is transitioning from Container Registry to Artifact Registry to store images running on Migrate Connector. This transition will be completed by October 15, 2025. For the most part, this change should not affect your usage of Migrate Connector or Migrate to Virtual Machines. However, for some configurations, you might have to add VPC-SC rules to allow Migrate Connector to access Artifact Registry. If you need help using Artifact Registry with Migrate to Virtual Machines, contact the Migrate to Virtual Machines support team.

August 24, 2022
Issue
Issue:
Linux repositories that use Yum as their package management may have Yum configurations set explicitly to minor versions. For example, a Yum configuration may point to specific repositories holding 7.6 packages. This is not currently supported by Google. Only repositories holding the latest versions are supported. This may cause a failure to install the Google guest environment after the VM is detached.
Workaround:
Update your Yum configuration to refer to the available repositories. For RHEL 7.x, verify that the variable $releasever holds the value 7Server , and not a specific release version number ( 7.6 , for example) by running echo 7Server > /etc/yum/vars/releasever .
August 02, 2022

Fixed
#199379063 Windows migrated VMs have GooGet installed with a wrong root directory
Windows VMs migrated before October 7th 2021 may have GooGet (Google package manager) installed with the wrong root directory ( C:\Windows\System32\%ProgramData%\GooGet instead of C:\ProgramData\GooGet ).
Workaround: Reinstall GooGet and guest environment by following the instructions to Install a guest environment in-place . A copy of googet.exe can also be found under C:\Google\Migrate\GooGet , which allows you to skip the download command in step 1. C:\Windows\System32\%ProgramData%\GooGet can be safely deleted if needed.
Following the steps to install a guest environment in place will also update guest environment packages to their latest released versions.

Workaround : Un-register the Velostrata plug-in and restart the vSphere Web client service, then re-register the plug-in. Contact support if the issue persists.
Issue
#131649978 : In the event of certain system failures, Velostrata components disconnect from vCenter. In this case, an event may not be sent, resulting in the alarm either not being set properly or not being cleared properly.
Workaround : Clear the alarm manually in vCenter.
Issue
#131548730 : In some cases, when a VM is moved to Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party VM-level backup solution holds a temporary snapshot, the Migrate for Compute Engine periodic write-back operations will not complete even after the backup solution deletes the temporary snapshot. The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an increasing size and no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.
Workaround : Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM and wait for the task to complete, which will commit all pending writes. Then select the Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many pending writes may take a while. Do not use the Force option as this will result in the loss of the uncommitted writes.
Feature

Issue
#131560126: Suse12: Due to a bug in SUSE kernel older than 4.2, configurations that include BTRFS mounts with subvolumes are not supported.
Workaround: Upgrade to SUSE version with Kernel >=4.2 (SP2).
Issue
#131637800: After registering the Velostrata plug-in, running the Cloud Extension wizard might generate an error "XXXXXXXXXX" upon "Finish".
Workaround: Un-register the Velostrata plug-in and restart the vSphere Web client service, then re-register the plug-in. Contact support if the issue persists.
Issue
#131548730: In some cases, when a VM is moved to Run-in-Cloud while a 3rd party VM-level backup solution holds a temporary snapshot, the Migrate for Compute Engine periodic write-back operations will not complete even after the backup solution deletes the temporary snapshot. The uncommitted writes counter on the VM will show an increasing size and no consistency checkpoint will be created on-premises.
Workaround: Select the Run On-Premises action for the VM and wait for the task to complete, which will commit all pending writes. Then select the Run-in-Cloud action again. Note that committing many pending writes may take a while. Do not use the Force option as this will result in the loss of the uncommitted writes.
Issue
#131650367: When performing a detach after a cancel detach operation, the action may fail.
Workaround: Retry the operation.
Issue
#131555885: vCenter "Export OVA" operation is available when the VM in cloud is running in cache mode, however, this operation results in a corrupted OVA.
Workaround: Only create OVA after the detach.
Issue
#131532690: Run-in-cloud and migration operations may fail for Windows Server 2016 workload when Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) is installed. This may also happen when SEP appears to be disabled.
Workaround: Modify workload Network interface bindings to remove the SEP option.
Download Microsoft Network VSP Bind (nvspbind)
Install Microsoft_Nvspbind_package.EXE into c:\temp.
Open a command prompt as an Administrator and run the following:
nvspbind.exe /d * symc_teefer2
Issue
#131647857: In rare cases, when a cloud component instance is created and system fails before it is tagged, the instance will remain untagged. This will not allow full clean-up or repair of the CE.
Workaround: Manually tag the instance, and then run "Repair".
Issue
#143313211: Customer migrating RHEL 6.8 VM may experience boot issues in the cloud destination.
RHEL 6.x systems using kernel versions 2.6.32-xxx and using LVM may reach a kernel panic when booting in Compute Engine during migration.
Workaround: The kernel should be upgraded to 2.6.32-754 or higher before migrating.
