Introduction
Migrate to Virtual Machines lets you migrate your EC2
instances from your AWS account to Google Compute Engine instances.
Prerequisites
Review Migrating VMs with Migrate to Virtual Machines: Getting started
documentation. This document provides insight into the overall structure of
Migrate to Virtual Machines, including important terms, concepts, and reference
information that help you migrate your workload efficiently and effectively.
Enable the VM Migration API on your host project using https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/vmmigration.googleapis.com .
Review the operating systems that support migrating VMs from AWS as a source to Google Cloud.
Migrate your workload from an AWS source
Before initiating your migration with AWS as a source, set up
your AWS environment by completing the following tasks:
Create an AWS IAM policy .
Create an IAM user to be accessed by
the Migrate to Virtual Machines service.
Recommended but optional: Tag EC2 instances intended for migration.
Create a source using Google Cloud.
Create an AWS IAM policy
Before creating an IAM user, create a policy that describes the
permissions for your intended workload. To create a policy, see the AWS
IAM documentation for Creating IAM policies .
Use the provided JSON template to provide migration permissions for your
policy:
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"ec2:DescribeInstances",
"ec2:DescribeVolumes",
"ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes",
"ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
"ec2:CreateTags",
"ec2:CreateSnapshots",
"ec2:StopInstances"
],
"Resource": "*"
},
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"ebs:ListSnapshotBlocks",
"ebs:ListChangedBlocks",
"ebs:GetSnapshotBlock",
"ec2:DeleteSnapshot",
"ec2:DeleteTags"
],
"Resource": "*",
"Condition": {
"StringEquals": {
"aws:ResourceTag/m2vm-resource": "snapshot"
}
}
}
]
}
If your EC2 instances use encrypted volumes with non-AWS managed keys, you must
add the following statement to the preceding policy to grant the created user
permission to access the encryption key.
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"kms:Decrypt",
"kms:DescribeKey"
],
"Resource": "<<KMS key ARN>>"
}
For more information about the permissions breakdown for the JSON template
fields, see permissions breakdown .
Create an IAM user
To migrate your AWS workload, create an IAM user for use by
Migrate to Virtual Machines. The IAM user enables Migrate to Virtual Machines
to interact with your account using the AWS public API.
To configure IAM user permissions to use AWS as source for your
migration, create an API user in the AWS IAM .
Note: Alternatively, you can configure an AWS source with temporary credentials
using an AWS Security Token Service (STS) token. For more information, see AwsSourceDetails .
During user creation, make sure you do the following:
Create a user with Programmatic access .
Attach the IAM policy you created in the previous section to
your new user.
Store the Access key ID and Secret access key generated during
this step. You need them when creating your source using Migrate to Virtual Machines.
Recommended but optional: Tag the EC2 instances that you want to migrate
Recommended: Tag the instances that you want to migrate. The tags
wantToMigrate and true provided in the image are examples.
For more information about tagging EC2 instances, see the
AWS IAM documentation .
Create an AWS source
After you have created an IAM user and have added that user to
your new IAM policy for Migrate to Virtual Machines, you must create
an AWS source before you can begin your migration process.
To create an AWS source:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines
page.
Select the SOURCES tab.
Open the ADD SOURCE drop-down and select ＋Add AWS Source .
Enter your source details on the Create AWS source panel.
Caution: You cannot edit the GCP region or AWS region fields
after creating your source. Access key ID and Secret access key
fields can be edited post-creation if necessary. Editing credentials
post-creation may interrupt an ongoing replication cycle. We recommended
you wait 24 hours before revoking your previous credentials.
The following table describes the parameters for AWS source details.
Detail
Description
Name (mandatory)
A string that identifies the source. The string must conform to Compute Engine naming conventions . You cannot update this field after creating your source.
GCP region (mandatory)
The region in Google Cloud that you want to migrate your
instances to. You cannot update this field after creating your source.
For more information, see locations documentation.
AWS region (mandatory)
The region in AWS (e.g. eu-west-1 ) from which
you want to migrate EC2 instances. The inventory displayed in
the Migrate to Virtual Machines console only includes EC2 instances from this AWS
region. You cannot update this field after creating your source.
Note: We recommend that you copy the region from your AWS console and
paste it into the source detail field to avoid typos. A typo results in the
source failing to become active and is indicated in the console. If
this happens, you must create a new source.
Access Key ID (mandatory)
Part of the IAM user credentials.
Secret access key (mandatory)
Part of the IAM user credentials.
Customer managed encryption key
The key you want to use to protect your data in Google Cloud. By default,
Google Cloud automatically
encrypts data when it is at rest using encryption keys managed by
Google. If you have specific compliance or regulatory requirements related
to the keys that protect your data, you can use
customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to encrypt and decrypt your
data at rest. These encryption keys are created, managed, and owned by you.
Note: The encryption key that you set will be used for
all the resources created under this source.
Optional: Filter inventory by security
groups
Filter visible EC2 instances in the Migrate to Virtual Machines inventory.
You can specify several group names, in which case Migrate to Virtual Machines
displays instances that belong to any of those security groups.
Recommended but optional: Filter inventory by VM tags
Specify the tags you want to filter your inventory by. We highly recommend
that you specify tags, as this lets you mark a subset of your EC2
instances you intend to migrate.
You can add the tags to the instances after you create the source, but you cannot change the tags the source filters by. If you specify several VM tags, Migrate to Virtual Machines only displays instances that have all of these tags.
If you specify several VM tags, Migrate to Virtual Machines only displays
instances that have all of these tags.
Optional: User tags for migration resource
Migrate to Virtual Machines creates
snapshots of your EC2 volumes to migrate them to Google Cloud.
If you would like to have a custom tag associated with these
resources, specify them here. This can help you identify all
resources created by Migrate to Virtual Machines in your AWS environment.
Snapshots already have tags as detailed in Snapshots .
Press the CREATE button. A notice detailing your new source appears.
Wait (up to 15 minutes but usually less) until the Source status is
indicated as Active .
Check your inventory to verify that there are instances that correspond to the
tags (and/or security groups) that you specified when you created your source.
As part of source creation, your project is automatically added as a target
project.
Cloud sources limitations
You can host a maximum of 15 cloud sources (AWS sources, Azure sources, or both
the sources combined) on a host project at a time. For example, you can host 10
AWS sources and 5 Azure sources on a host project at a time. Conversely, you
can host 7 AWS sources and 8 Azure sources on a host project at a time. If you
want to add a new cloud source to a project that already hosts 15 cloud
sources, you must delete an existing source, and then add the new source. You
can also try using a different project to host the new cloud source if you
don't want to delete any existing sources.
Next steps: Start your migration
After you've created an AWS source, you are ready to start your migration. The
rest of the process for migrating your workload from an AWS source matches the
process for other sources for Migrate to Virtual Machines.
For details on how to start your migration process, see
Migrating individual VM .
Differences from using Azure as a source
The usage is almost identical to the usage of Azure as a source.
