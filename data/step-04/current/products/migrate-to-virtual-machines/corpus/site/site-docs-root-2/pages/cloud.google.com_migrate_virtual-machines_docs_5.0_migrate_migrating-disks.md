Migrate VM disks and attach them to a new VM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Migrate to Virtual Machines lets you migrate disks from source virtual machine (VM)
instances to Persistent Disk volumes on Google Cloud, with minimal
interruptions to the workload. You can also create a new VM instance and attach
the migrated Persistent Disk volumes to it.
Migration process
The following are the steps of the disk migration process:
Onboard : Select the VM whose disks you want to migrate.
Replicate : Replicate data from the disks of the source VM to Persistent Disk
volumes on Google Cloud. Data replication is a continuous process that
takes place in the background until the final cut-over or you deleting the
migration.
Set VM target details : Configure settings for the migrated Persistent Disk
volumes. If you choose to create a new VM instance to attach the Persistent Disk
volumes to, you must configure the setting for the VM instance as well.
Clone disks to target : Create a clone of the source VM's disk based on
target details.
Cut-over disks to target : Migrate disks from the source VM. This
process includes stopping the source VM and performing a final replication
of the disks.
Finalize : Clean up all resources consumed by the migration following a
successful cut-over operation.
The disk migration process follows the same steps as the VM migration
process. Therefore, you can choose to switch from VM migration to disk migration
and the other way around at any point during the migration process. For more
information, see Switch from disk migration to VM migration .
Note: You can migrate your VM's boot disk as a data disk using the disk migration
process in cases where OS adaptation is not needed. If you want to migrate
the boot disk with the OS (to be able to use it as a boot disk), then VM migration is more suitable.
Prerequisites
Perform the following steps to configure the migration environment on your
migration source
and migration target .
Enable Migrate to Virtual Machines services .
(Only for VMware VM migration) Install the Migrate Connector .
Step 1: Onboard a VM
Disk migration is performed at the VM level, and so the first phase of migration
is to onboard the source VM. For example, a vSphere data center might contain
many VMs. Onboard only the VMs whose disks you want to migrate.
You can have up to 200 migrations in progress at a time (excluding migrations
in the Finalize phase), per host project and region. The limitation is for
migrating disks from VMs of all source types. For example, you can migrate disks
attached to 100 VMs from a VMware source and 100 additional VMs from AWS at the
same time.
To onboard a source VM, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Sources tab.
From the drop-down list, select the migration source from which you want to
migrate disks.
Below the drop-down you see the Source status of the migration source as
follows:
Active : The source is active and connected to Migrate to Virtual Machines.
Offline : The source is unavailable.
Pending : The source is in the process of being connected and verified.
If you don't see any entries in the drop-down list, it indicates that you have
not configured the migration source properly. Review the steps for your
setting your migration source and try again.
A table appears showing the source VMs in the migration source available for
migration. Select one or more source VMs.
The VM Power Status column shows the status as Suspended ,
On , or Off . You can migrate a VM with any of these statuses.
Click Add Migrations > Disk Migration .
Confirm that you want to create the migration.
After you create a migration, the Replication status column
for a VM displays one of the following:
Pending : VM is in the process of being onboarded.
Ready : VM is onboarded but has not started replicating yet.
You can now start replication of the VM as described in the next step.
Step 2: Start replication of the source VM
After onboarding a source VM, start replicating the disk data from the source VM
to Google Cloud.
This process takes place in the background with no disruption to the workload.
Data replication is comprised of two steps, follow these steps:
First replication step : Migrate to Virtual Machines creates the initial
snapshot of the source VM data disks and replicates the snapshot data to
Google Cloud. Depending on the amount of disk data on the source VM,
the first replication can take minutes or hours to complete.
The Replication status column of a VM on the first replication step
displays the First sync status followed by the appropriate sub-step.
Incremental replication step : Following a successful first replication
step, incremental replication steps occur at set time intervals (every two
hours by default). In each step, a new snapshot is created for each data disk.
Only data updates that occurred after the previous step are replicated to
Google Cloud using the Change Block Tracking (CBT) mechanism.
The Replication status column of a VM on an incremental replication step
displays the Active status followed by the appropriate sub-step.
Initiate replication of a source VM
To initiate replication of a source VM, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the VM Disk Migrations tab.
A table appears showing the source VMs along with the disks attached to each
VM. You can start replication of the disks on any VM with the replication
status Ready .
Note: Replications are performed at the VM-level. When you replicate a VM,
all the disks on the VM are replicated. You cannot select individual disks on
a VM to replicate. However, you can select individual disks to create in a
test-clone or cut-over phases.
Select one or more source VMs.
Click Migration > Start Replication . The Replication status column
shows replication status along with one of the sub-steps detailed in the
replication cycle sub-steps table .
To view the replication history of a VM, click the VM to open the details
page. Click Replication History to view the replication history of the VM
along with the sub-steps of the replication .
Migrate to Virtual Machines saves and displays up to 100 cycles of
replication history for a VM.
You can now configure a migration target for the
test-clone and cut-over phases.
You can create a test-clone of a disk at any time after the first replication step
completes. Replication continues until you explicitly end it during the cut-over
phase.
Pause replication
At any time, you can pause replication for a VM. When you pause replication for
a VM, its Replication status changes to Paused .
To pause replication, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the VM Disk Migrations tab.
A table of available source VMs appears.
Select one or more VMs.
Select Pause .
To later resume replication, select one or more VMs and then select Resume .
Set the replication interval
To set the replication interval, follow these steps:
By default, Migrate to Virtual Machines performs a replication of the source VM every
2 hours. To set the replication interval, perform the following steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the VM Disk Migrations tab.
A table of available source VMs appears.
For the VM, select the Edit Target Details button. A panel opens to let
you configure the target.
Select the Target Details tab.
In the Replication policy area, set the replication frequency, in seconds.
Select Save .
To set the frequency for multiple VMs, select the VMs and then select the
Edit Target Details button. A panel opens to let you configure the
replication frequency of the selected VMs.
Switch from disk migration to VM migration
You can switch between disk migration and VM migration at any time during the
migration process. To switch from disk migration to VM migration, follow these
steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the VM Disk Migrations tab.
Select one or more VMs.
Click Migration > Convert to VM migration .
Switching from disk migration to VM migration clears out the target details.
This is because the target details for disk migration and VM migration are
different. However, the replication progress isn't lost during the switch.
You must update the target details before you clone or cut-over
operations on your VM in order for the migration to succeed. For more
information, see Configuring the target .
Step 3: Configure the target for a migrated VM disk
Migrate to Virtual Machines lets you migrate the disks of a source VM to Persistent Disk
volumes on Google Cloud with the following options:
Migrate the disks to Persistent Disk volumes
Migrate the disks to Persistent Disk volumes and attach them to a new VM instance
You must configure the target details such as project, zone, disk type, and more
based on the option you choose. The target project is the project that contains
the Persistent Disk volumes migrated from the source VM, or the newly created VM
instance to which you want to attach the migrated Persistent Disk volumes. You can
modify the target details at any time. When you create a test-clone or cut-over,
Migrate to Virtual Machines uses the target details settings at the time of the
operation.
The host project
is automatically added as a target project so there is no need to explicitly add
it. If you want to add an additional project as a target project, see
Adding a target project .
To configure the Persistent Disk target, follow these steps:
If you have not done so already, add the target project as shown in Adding a target .
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the VM Disk Migrations tab.
A table of migrations appears.
Select a source VM (you can select multiple VMs to edit) and click
Edit target details . On the panel that appears, configure the target
details for all of your selected VMs.
Set the Target details that define the characteristics of the Persistent Disk
volumes to which you want to migrate your data. The following table lists those
settings in detail.
Section title
Field name
Description
General
Project
The name of the project hosting the Persistent Disk volumes. It must be a project you have already added earlier in this section.
Zone
Zone for the Persistent Disk volumes. See
Regions and Zones .
Disk Configuration
Name
Enter a name for the disk.
Disk Type
Select the type of Persistent Disk. See
Persistent Disk types .
Customer managed encryption key
The key you want to use to protect your data in Google Cloud. By default,
Google Cloud automatically
encrypts data when it is at rest using encryption keys managed by
Google. If you have specific compliance or regulatory requirements related
to the keys that protect your data, you can use
customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to encrypt and decrypt your
data at rest. These encryption keys are created, managed, and owned by you.
When you add a CMEK, you must also assign the
Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter role permissions to the
Compute Engine Service Agent account you are using. For more
information, see
Protect resources by using Cloud KMS keys .
Note: If you've set an encryption key for your source,
the same encryption key will be used here. If you've not set a key for the
source, then you can't select any encryption type.
Labels
To organize your project, add labels as key/value pairs to your resources.
See
Labeling resources .
Attach to a VM
Attach disks to VM
Select Don't attach to a VM if you don't want to attach
the Persistent Disk volumes to a VM instance.
Select Create a VM from a disk image if you want to create a
VM instance and attach the Persistent Disk volumes to it. If you choose this
option, you must set the target details that define the attributes of the new
VM instance to which you want to attach the migrated Persistent Disk volumes. For
more information on these settings, see Configure the target for a VM .
Replication Policy
Replication idle duration between cycles
By default, Migrate to Virtual Machines performs a replication of the source VM every 2 hours.
Set the replication frequency (in seconds).
Note: The replication cycle idle time counter starts after the previous replication cycle ends.
Click Save .
(Optional) Step 4: Test a clone of a migrating disk
In the test-clone phase, you can check if the Persistent Disk volumes created during
the replication phase are functioning as expected. For example, you can attach
the migrated Persistent Disk volumes to a Compute Engine instance in your target
environment to check if the disks are working as expected.
If you have created a new VM instance and attached the migrated Persistent Disk
volumes to it, Migrate to Virtual Machines deploys a clone of the VM instance to a
Compute Engine instance in your target environment to test it. While the
testing phase is optional, it is best practice to perform testing before you
perform a cut-over to the migrated disk.
Each time you create a test-clone instance, it is cloned from the most recently
completed replication cycle data using the current target details. In other
words, a test-clone instance represents a snapshot of the source VM at the
time of the last completed replication cycle.
Caution: New replication data and modifications to the target details are only
applied to new test-clones, not to existing test-clones.
Initiate your first test-clone
You can create your first test-clone after the initial replication cycle completes,
and then create additional test-clones throughout your migration process.
In order for you to initiate a test-clone, you must have already configured a
target environment for the Persistent Disk volumes or the new VM instance to which
you want to attach the migrated Persistent Disk volumes. For more information,
see Configuring the target .
You can only test a VM in the Paused state if it has completed at least
one replication.
For more information on potential issues during the test-clone phase, see
the Troubleshooting section.
Create a test-clone of the disks of a VM
To create a test-clone of the disks of a VM using Migrate to Virtual Machines, use
the following steps:
Verify that you have configured a testing target environment as described in
Configuring VM target .
Note: You can only test-clone a disk with a valid target environment.
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the VM Disk Migrations tab.
A table of available source VMs appears. You can test any VM that is in the
Active (Current cycle: XX%) or Active (Idle) state. The Active
state means the first replication sync of the VM succeeded and VM data is
being incrementally replicated.
Select a VM.
Select Cut-Over and Test-Clone > Test-Clone . The Test-Clone/Cut-Over status
column shows the status of the operation along with one of the sub-steps
detailed in the test-clone sub-steps table .
Wait for the Test-Clone/Cut-Over status column to show Succeeded . This
indicates that the clone was created successfully.
You can view the test-clone history of a VM in one of the following ways:
Click the Info panel icon, for the VM. On the panel that opens from the right, the
Monitoring tab displays the history, including the name of each
test-clone instance.
Click the VM to open the details page. Click Test-Clone/Cut-Over History
to view the test-clone history of the VM along with the sub-steps of the test-clone .
You can cancel an active test-clone operation by clicking Cut-Over and Test-Clone > Cancel Test-Clone .
You can now create any VM and attach the test-clone disks to it to
check if the migrated disks are working as expected.
After you have completed testing, delete the VM instance to free up resources
so that you are no longer charged for the instance.
Manage multiple test-clones
Over the duration of your migration journey, you might create multiple test-clones.
For example, you create the first test-clone after the initial replication cycle.
Then, as you refine your migration, you create new test-clones because of the
following:
Modifications you make to your source VM to support migration
Modifications you make to the target details
New replication data from the source VM
Any other changes you make over the duration of your testing cycle
Remember that a test-clone is a snapshot of the source VM created from the
current replication data and target details. New replication data and modifications
to the target details are only applied to new test-clones, not to existing
test-clones.
If you have an existing test-clone instance running, then before you create a
new test-clone you can either:
Delete the existing test-clone instance and create a new one with the same
instance name. You cannot create a new instance with the same name as an
existing instance.
Edit the target details to set new unique names for the disks.
To monitor all test-clone instances, follow these steps:
View the test-clone history of a VM in one of the following ways:
Click the Info panel icon, for the VM. On the panel that opens from the
right, the Monitoring tab displays the history, including the name of
each test-clone instance.
Click the VM to open the details page. Click Test-Clone/Cut-Over History
to view the test-clone history of the VM along with the sub-steps of the test-clone .
After you create a test-clone, it is up to you to manage it. If you want to
modify or delete a running test-clone disk or the VM instance you created to
test the disk, you must use the respective product's tools. You cannot manage
these resources using Migrate to Virtual Machines tools.
Step 5: Create a cut-over
In the cut-over phase, you transfer control to your migrated disk, or the new VM
you created with the migrated Persistent Disk volumes attached to it, in your target
environment on Google Cloud.
The cut-over process, follow these steps:
If data replication is active, that is, the Replication status
of the VM is Active (Current cycle: XX%) , waits for it to complete.
Note: To perform cut-over, replication cannot be paused.
Shuts down the source VM.
Performs the final data replication. Because replication occurs throughout
all migration phases, the amount of data to replicate shouldn't be very large.
Stops replication.
Creates the Persistent Disk volumes from the final replicated data.
Note: You must have already configured the Persistent Disk target details
before you can initiate a cut-over. For more information, see Configuring the target .
The cut-over phase includes a short VM downtime and should take place during a
scheduled maintenance window. You must determine the maintenance window during
which you can stop the source VM and redirect traffic to the migrated disk.
Create a cut-over
To create a cut-over, perform the following steps:
Verify that you have configured the target details as described in
Configuring VM target . If the target details were
previously configured for test-clone operation, you might want to edit the
target details to point to a new target.
Note: You can only cut-over a VM with a valid target environment.
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the VM Disk Migrations tab.
A table of available source VMs appears. You can cut-over any VM that is in
the Active (Current cycle: XX%) or Active (Idle) state. The Active
state means the first replication sync of the VM succeeded and VM data is
being incrementally replicated.
The Estimated cut-over time column shows an estimate of the time it
takes to complete a cut-over job for a VM after you initiate a cut-over.
This field is populated only for an active VM that has completed a few
replication cycles.
The Test-Clone/Cut-Over status column shows the status of the operation
along with one of the sub-steps detailed in the cut-over sub-steps table .
Select a source VM.
Select Cut-Over and Test-Clone > Cut-Over . Initiating a cut-over on a
VM starts the following sequence of actions performed by Migrate to Virtual Machines:
Shuts down the source VM.
Performs the final data replication. Because continuous replication occurs
throughout all migration phases, the amount of data to replicate shouldn't
be very large.
Creates the Persistent Disk volumes hosting the migrated VM from the final
replicated data.
Stops data replication.
Wait for the Test-Clone/Cut-Over status column to show Cut-over job
completed. This indicates that the cut-over succeeded.
You can view the cut-over history of a VM in one of the following ways:
Click the Info panel icon, , for the VM. On the panel that opens from the right, the
Monitoring tab displays the history, including the name of each
cut-over instance.
Click the VM to open the details page. Click Test-Clone/Cut-Over History
to view the cut-over history of the VM along with the sub-steps of the cut-over .
You can cancel an active cut-over operation by clicking Cut-Over and Test-Clone > Cancel Cut-Over .
However, if you want to resume use of the source VM, you must manually restart
the VM.
Perform validation test on the migrated disks.
Retry cut-over
If for any reason you want to retry cut-over, follow these steps:
Select a VM in the Cut-Over state.
Select Migration > Resume Replication .
Retry cut-over.
Roll back from the cut-over
To rollback from cut-over, follow these steps:
Cut-over stops the original source VM in your migration source, so you must
start it and redirect traffic back to the source VM.
If necessary, copy new data created on the Persistent Disk volumes so that you
can write it to the source VM.
(Optional) Delete Persistent Disk volumes.
Resume replication on the source VM. Replication resumes
from the last snapshot taken.
Retry cut-over.
Step 6: Finalize a migration
The replication data used to create Persistent Disk volumes is retained after cut-over
to allow you to resume replication from the last replication snapshot. However,
you are charged for the storage used by the replication data until you delete it
in the finalize phase. Finalizing deletes all replication data and storage
resources.
The Finalize phase does not delete Persistent Disk volumes. If you created
Persistent Disk volumes during the testing phase, you must manually delete them. You
are charged for those test-clone Persistent Disk volumes until they are deleted.
To finalize a migration, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the VM Disk Migrations tab.
A table of available source VMs appears. Finalize can be performed only on VMs
in the Cut-Over state.
Select a source VM.
Click Finalize and then confirm the finalize.
After finalize phase completes, the state of the VM is set to Finalized .
The only allowed operations on a migration in the Finalized state are:
Delete the migration
Add to or remove from a group
Delete a migration
Deleting a migration removes the following:
The replication data for the VM stored on Google Cloud
The Persistent Disk configuration information
The monitoring history
All other data associated with migrating a disk
The VM from the list of onboarded VMs on the VM Disk Migrations tab
The VM from its group, if the VM is a member of a group
However, deleting a migration does not remove the source VM from the list of
available VMs for the migration source displayed on the Sources tab. That is,
only the migration data for the VM is deleted. The original source VM itself is
not affected when you delete a migration.That means you can later onboard the
source VM again to migrate it.
To delete a migration, follow these steps:
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the VM Disk Migrations tab.
Select a source VM.
Click Delete and then confirm the deletion.
The VM is removed from the Migration table.
Select the Sources tab.
From the drop-down list, select the migration source that you want to delete.
A table appears showing the source VMs in the migration source available for
migration. Notice that the source VM corresponding to the deleted migration
is still listed.
If necessary, you can restart a disk migration on the VM.
