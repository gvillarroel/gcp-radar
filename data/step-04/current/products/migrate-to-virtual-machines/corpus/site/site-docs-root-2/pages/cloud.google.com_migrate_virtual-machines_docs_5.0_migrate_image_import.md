Import virtual disk images
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Migrate to Virtual Machines lets you import a virtual disk image to a Compute Engine
image. If you have virtual disk images in your environment with
software and configurations that you need, you can save time by importing these
virtual disk images to Compute Engine, and using the resulting image to create
virtual machine instances or persistent disks.
Before you begin
Enable the VM Migration API on your project. For more information about
enabling the VM Migration API, see Enable Migrate to Virtual Machines services .
Verify that the operating system on the disk is supported by
Migrate to Virtual Machines. For more information, see Supported operating systems .
Verify that the virtual disk image files that you want to import are supported .
Supported formats
You can import virtual disk image files in the following formats using
Migrate to Virtual Machines:
A single virtual machine disk (VMDK) - Recommended option, VMDK files are imported
faster
Note: Only monolithic VMDK files are supported. If you have a -flat.vmdk file and a .vmdk descriptor file, you can import these files by renaming the -flat.vmdk file to disk.raw , and compressing it as a .tar.gz file.
QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW)
QEMU copy-on-write 2 (QCOW2)
QEMU enhanced disk format (QED)
VPC
Virtual disk image (VDI)
Virtual hard disk v2 (VHDX)
Virtual hard disk (VHD)
In addition to these formats, you can also import raw images from a RAW file ( .raw ), or from a compressed tar file ( .tar.gz ). When you use a compressed tar file, ensure that it contains a single file named disk.raw .
Limitations
You can import disk images with Arm architecture to the following regions:

Image import process
To import a virtual disk image to a Compute Engine image using
Migrate to Virtual Machines, use the following steps:
Prepare a virtual disk image file for import
Choose a target project
Import a virtual disk image to Compute Engine
Prepare a virtual disk file for import
To import a virtual disk image to a Compute Engine image, you must first
prepare the virtual disk image file for import. The following sections discuss
these tasks in detail.
Add the virtual disk image file to Cloud Storage
To import a virtual disk image to a Compute Engine image, you must first add
the virtual disk image file to Cloud Storage. For more information, see
Upload objects from a file system . For
better performance, we recommend that you upload the virtual disk image file to
a bucket in the same cloud region in which you want to create the image.
Grant the required permissions
To import a virtual disk image to a Compute Engine image, grant permissions as
described in the following table.
Role
Permissions required
Description
Storage Object Viewer
roles/storage.objectViewer
Grant the default Migrate to Virtual Machines service account in the host
project ( service- HOST_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-vmmigration.iam.gserviceaccount.com ) the roles/storage.objectViewer role on the bucket where
the image you want to import resides. This permission lets
Migrate to Virtual Machines access the source image.
VM Migration Administrator
roles/vmmigration.admin
In the host project, grant the user account that you want to use to
import the source image the roles/vmmigration.admin role.
VM Migration Service Account
roles/vmmigration.serviceAgent
Grant the default Migrate to Virtual Machines service account in the host
project ( service- HOST_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-vmmigration.iam.gserviceaccount.com ) the roles/vmmigration.serviceAgent role on the target
project. For example, if service-1234567890@gcp-sa-vmmigration.iam.gserviceaccount.com
is the Migrate to Virtual Machines service account in the host project, you
must grant this service account the roles/vmmigration.serviceAgent
role to be able to create the image in the target project.
Choose a target project
To host the Compute Engine image, you must create or choose a target project.
A target project defines the destination project for a Compute Engine image.
For more information on creating or choosing a target project, see
Adding a target project .
Import a virtual disk image to Compute Engine
You can import a virtual disk image to Compute Engine using the
Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or REST API commands.
Console
To import a virtual disk image to Compute Engine using the Google Cloud console,
use the following steps.
Open the Migrate to Virtual Machines page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Migrate to Virtual Machines page
Select the Image imports tab.
Click Import image .
Define the characteristics of the image. The following table lists the
parameters that you can set for your image.
Section title
Field name
Description
General
Name
The name of the image that you want to create. For more information on
the naming rules, see Naming convention .
Image import ID
An ID that represents the image import resource. When you import an
image to Compute Engine, Migrate to Virtual Machines first creates an image
import resource. The image import resource represents the image import
process. You can use the Image import ID to get the link to the image
that was imported as part of the image import process.
Source Cloud Storage file
The file from which you want to import the image. Click
Browse to view the list of buckets in your current
project, and select the file from which you want to import the image.
If you want to import an image from a bucket from another project, you must
enter the path in the format bucket/folder/file . To get the path of
an object inside a bucket, see View object metadata . When you copy the path, make sure that you don't copy the
gs:// prefix.
Note that you can only import images from .vmdk and
.tar.gz files.
Region
The region in which you want to create the image. For a list of
supported regions, see Regions and zones .
Target project
The target project in which you want to create the image. If you've
not already added a target project, do so using the instructions given in
Add a target project .
Family
(Optional) Select the image family. Compute Engine provides image
families to help you make sure that your automation systems can reference
the latest images. As an administrator, you can group a set of images as
an image family. For more information, see Public image families .
Description
(Optional) Add a description for the image.
Skip OS adaptation
To skip OS adaptation, click the Skip OS adaptation
toggle to the on position.
To function properly on Google Cloud, VMs created from imported images
require changes to be made to their configuration. These changes are
referred to as OS adaptations . Migrate to Virtual Machines performs OS
adaptations automatically in the image import process. For more information,
see Adapt VM instances to run on Google Cloud .
Generalize
To generalize the image, click the Generalize
toggle to the on position. When you create an instance from an image,
Windows adds some unique information to the instance. Generalize is a
process that removes this information so that you can create multiple
instances from the same image.
Licenses
License type
Compute Engine supports pay as you go (PAYG) licenses and bring your
own licenses (BYOL) for your deployed VMs. The default license type for a
migrated VM is assigned by Migrate to Virtual Machines based on the migrated
operating system, as described in Supported operating systems .
If your operating system supports multiple license types, you can override
the default license type to explicitly specify a license type of PAYG or BYOL.
Note: Some operating system types, such
as CentOS and Debian, don't support a license. Other operating systems only
support one type of license. Attempting to set an unsupported license type
causes an error when you attempt to import the image.
Additional licenses
Additional licenses
You can add up to 10 additional licenses to the VM instance created
from the imported image using a valid URL format. For example, you can add
additional licenses using the following URL format:
https://www.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/windows-sql-cloud/global/licenses/sql-server-2012-enterprise
Labels
To organize your project, add labels as key-value pairs to your
resources. See Organize resources using labels .
Encryption
Google-managed encryption key
Choose this option to use Google-owned and Google-managed encryption keys to
encrypt your data during the import process. For more information, see
encrypts data when it is at rest .
Customer managed encryption key
Choose this option to use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to
encrypt your data during the import process, and the data of the image
created by the import process. If you have specific compliance or
regulatory requirements related to the keys that protect your data, you
can use CMEK to encrypt and decrypt your data.
These encryption keys are created, managed, and owned by you. For more
information, see
Protect resources by using Cloud KMS keys .
When you add a CMEK, you must grant permissions as described in the
following table.
Role
Permissions required
Description
Cloud VM Migration Service Account
roles/vmmigration.serviceAgen
Grant this permission to the Compute Engine service account
to encrypt data of the image created during the import process.
Compute Engine Service Agent
roles/compute.serviceAgent
Grant this permission to the Migrate to Virtual Machines service
agent to encrypt the data during the import process.
