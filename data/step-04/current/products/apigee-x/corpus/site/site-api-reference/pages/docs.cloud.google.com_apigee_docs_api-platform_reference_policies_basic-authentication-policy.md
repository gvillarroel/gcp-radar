BasicAuthentication policy
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Extensible policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
The BasicAuthentication policy enables you to use lightweight
Basic Authentication for
last-mile security. The policy takes a username and password, Base64 encodes them, and writes the
resulting value to a variable. The resulting value is in the form Basic
Base64EncodedString . You typically write this value to an HTTP header, such as
the Authorization header.
The policy has two modes of operations:
Encode : Base64 encodes a username and password stored in
variables
Decode : Decodes the username and password from a
Base64 encoded string
The username and password are commonly stored in the key/value store and then read from the
key/value store at runtime. For details on using key/value store, see
Key Value Map Operations policy .
This policy does not enforce Basic Authentication on a request
to an API proxy. Instead, use it to encode/decode credentials as Base64, typically when
connecting to a backend server or using a service callout policy, such as the
Service Callout policy , that requires Basic Authentication.
Warning: Basic authentication does not provide confidentiality.
Always send credentials over a TLS-enabled (HTTPS) connection to your backend service.
This policy is an Extensible policy and use of this policy might have cost or
utilization implications, depending on your Apigee license. For information on policy types
and usage implications, see
Policy types .
Samples
Outbound encoding
<BasicAuthentication name="ApplyBasicAuthHeader">
<DisplayName>ApplyBasicAuthHeader</DisplayName>
<Operation>Encode</Operation>
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
<User ref="BasicAuth.credentials.username" />
<Password ref="BasicAuth.credentials.password" />
<AssignTo createNew="false">request.header.Authorization</AssignTo>
</BasicAuthentication>
In the sample policy configuration above, the username and password to be encoded are
derived from the variables specified by the ref attributes on the
<User> and <Password> elements. The variables must be
set before this policy executes. Typically, the variables are populated by values that are
read from a key/value map. See Key Value Map
Operations policy .
This configuration results in the HTTP header named Authorization , as specified by the
<AssignTo> element,
being added to the outbound request message sent to the backend server:
Authorization: Basic TXlVc2VybmFtZTpNeVBhc3N3b3Jk
The <User> and <Password> values are concatenated
with a colon prior to Base64 encoding.
Consider that you have a key/value map with the following entry:
{
"encrypted" : true,
"entry" : [ {
"name" : "username",
"value" : "MyUsername
}, {
"name" : "password",
"value" : "MyPassword
} ],
"name" : "BasicAuthCredentials"
}
Attach the following KeyValueMapOperations policies before the BasicAuthentication policy
to be able to extract the values for your <User> and
<Password> elements from the key/value store and populate them to the
variables credentials.username and credentials.password .
< KeyValueMapOperations name = "getCredentials" mapIdentifier = "BasicAuthCredentials" >
< Scope>apiproxy < / Scope >
< Get assignTo = "credentials.username" index = '1' >
< Key >
< Parameter>username < / Parameter >
< / Key >
< / Get >
< Get assignTo = "credentials.password" index = '1' >
< Key >
< Parameter>password < / Parameter >
< / Key >
< / Get >
< / KeyValueMapOperations >
Inbound decoding
<BasicAuthentication name="DecodeBaseAuthHeaders">
<DisplayName>Decode Basic Authentication Header</DisplayName>
<Operation>Decode</Operation>
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
<User ref="request.header.username" />
<Password ref="request.header.password" />
<Source>request.header.Authorization</Source>
</BasicAuthentication>
In this policy sample, the policy decodes the username and password from the
Authorization HTTP header, as specified by the <Source> element. The Base64
encoded string must be in the form Basic Base64EncodedString.
The policy writes the decoded username to the request.header.username variable and
the decoded password to the request.header.password variable.
Element reference
The element reference describes the elements and attributes of the BasicAuthentication
policy.
<BasicAuthentication async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Basic-Authentication-1">
<DisplayName>Basic Authentication 1</DisplayName>
<Operation>Encode</Operation>
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
<User ref="request.queryparam.username" />
<Password ref="request.queryparam.password" />
<AssignTo createNew="false">request.header.Authorization</AssignTo>
<Source>request.header.Authorization</Source>
</BasicAuthentication>
<BasicAuthentication> attributes
<BasicAuthentication async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Basic-Authentication-1">
The following table describes attributes that are common to all policy parent elements:
Attribute
Description
Default
Presence
name
The internal name of the policy. The value of the name attribute can
contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, underscores, and periods. This value cannot
exceed 255 characters.
Optionally, use the <DisplayName> element to label the policy in
the management UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language name.
N/A
Required
continueOnError
Set to false to return an error when a policy fails. This is expected
behavior for most policies.
Set to true to have flow execution continue even after a policy
fails. See also:
Fault rules are triggered ONLY in an error state (about continueOnError)
Handling faults within the current flow
false
Optional
enabled
Set to true to enforce the policy.
Set to false to turn off the policy. The policy will not be
enforced even if it remains attached to a flow.
true
Optional
async
This attribute is deprecated.
false
Deprecated
<DisplayName> element
Use in addition to the name attribute to label the policy in the
management UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language name.
<DisplayName>Policy Display Name</DisplayName>
Default
N/A
If you omit this element, the value of the policy's name attribute is
used.
Presence
Optional
Type
String
<Operation> element
Determines whether the policy Base64 encodes or decodes credentials.
<Operation>Encode</Operation>
Default:
N/A
Presence:
Required
Type:
String.
Valid values include:
Encode
Decode
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables> element
When set to true , the policy will not throw an error if a variable cannot be
resolved. When used in the context of a BasicAuthentication policy, this setting is usually set
to false because it is generally beneficial to throw an error if a username or
password cannot be found in the variables specified.
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
Default:
true
Presence:
Optional
Type:
Boolean
<User> element
For encoding, use the <User> element to specify the variable
containing the username. Username and password values are concatenated with a colon prior to
Base64 encoding.
For decoding, specify the variable where the decoded username is written.
<User ref="request.queryparam.username" />
Default:
N/A
Presence:
Required
Type:
N/A
Attributes
Attribute
Description
Default
Presence
ref
The variable from which the policy dynamically reads the username (encode) or writes
the username (decode).
N/A
Required
<Password> element
For encoding, use the <Password> element to specify the variable
containing the password.
For decoding, specify the variable where the decoded password is written.
<Password ref="request.queryparam.password" />
Default:
N/A
Presence:
Required
Type:
N/A
Attributes
Attribute
Description
Default
Presence
ref
The variable from which the policy dynamically reads the password (encode) or writes
the password (decode).
N/A
Required
<AssignTo> element
Specifies the target variable to set with the encoded or decoded value generated by this
policy.
The following example indicates that the policy should set the Authorization
header of the message to the generated value:
<AssignTo createNew="false">request.header.Authorization</AssignTo>
Default:
N/A
Presence:
Required
Type:
String
Attributes
Attribute
Description
Default
Presence
createNew
Determines whether the policy should overwrite the variable if the variable is already
set.
When "false", the assignment to the variable occurs only if the variable is
currently unset (null).
When "true", the assignment to the variable always occurs.
You typically set this attribute to "false" (the default).
false
Optional
<Source> element
For decoding, the variable containing the Base64 encoded string, in the
form Basic Base64EncodedString . For example,
specify request.header.Authorization , corresponding to the Authorization header.
<Source>request.header.Authorization</Source>
Default:
N/A
Presence:
Required for the Decode operation.
Type:
N/A
Flow variables
The following flow variable is set when the policy fails:
BasicAuthentication.{policy_name}.failed (with a value of true)
Note: If you see variables called BasicAuthentication.{policy_name}.fault.cause
and BasicAuthentication.{policy_name}.fault.name ,
they are not currently being used by Apigee.
Error reference
This section describes the fault codes and error messages that are returned and fault variables that are set by Apigee when this policy triggers an error. This information is important to know if you are developing fault rules to
handle errors. To learn more, see What you need to know
about policy errors and Handling
faults .
Runtime errors
These errors can occur when the policy executes.
Use API Monitoring to investigate fault
codes and diagnose issues faster. See Set up a policy fault code alert
for an example. See Fault code reference for a complete
list of all fault codes that you can handle with API Monitoring.
-->
Fault code
HTTP status
Cause
Fix
steps.basicauthentication.InvalidBasicAuthenticationSource
500
On a decode when the incoming Base64 encoded string does not contain a valid value or
the header is malformed (for example, does not start with Basic ).
build
steps.basicauthentication.UnresolvedVariable
500
The required source variables for the decode or encode are not present. This error can
only occur if IgnoreUnresolvedVariables is false.
build
Deployment errors
These errors can occur when you deploy a proxy containing this policy.
Error name
Occurs when
Fix
UserNameRequired
The <User> element must be present for the named operation.
build
PasswordRequired
The <Password> element must be present for the named operation.
build
AssignToRequired
The <AssignTo> element must be present for the named operation.
build
SourceRequired
The <Source> element must be present for the named operation.
build
Fault variables
These variables are set when a runtime error occurs. For more information, see What you need to know
about policy errors .
Variables
Where
Example
fault.name=" fault_name "
fault_name is the name of the fault, as listed in the Runtime errors table above. The fault name is the last part of the fault code.
fault.name Matches "UnresolvedVariable"
BasicAuthentication. policy_name .failed
policy_name is the user-specified name of the policy that threw the fault.
BasicAuthentication.BA-Authenticate.failed = true
Example error response
Note: For error handling, the best practice is to trap the
errorcode part of the error response. Do not rely on the text in the
faultstring , because it could change.
{
"fault" :{
"detail" :{
"errorcode" : "steps.basicauthentication.UnresolvedVariable"
},
"faultstring" : "Unresolved variable : request.queryparam.password"
}
}
Example fault rule
<FaultRule name="Basic Authentication Faults">
<Step>
<Name>AM-UnresolvedVariable</Name>
<Condition>(fault.name Matches "UnresolvedVariable") </Condition>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>AM-AuthFailedResponse</Name>
<Condition>(fault.name = "InvalidBasicAuthenticationSource")</Condition>
</Step>
<Condition>(BasicAuthentication.BA-Authentication.failed = true) </Condition>
</FaultRule>
