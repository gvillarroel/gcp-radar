Extensible policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
The GenerateJWS policy generates a signed JWS, with a configurable set of claims. The JWS can
then be returned to clients, transmitted to backend targets, or used in other ways.
See JWS and JWT policies overview for a detailed
introduction.
To learn about the parts of a JWS and how they are encrypted and signed, refer to
RFC7515 .
This policy is an Extensible policy and use of this policy might have cost or
utilization implications, depending on your Apigee license. For information on policy types
and usage implications, see
Policy types .
Samples
Generate a JWS signed with HS256
This example policy generates a JWS that is signed using the HS256 algorithm. HS256 relies
on a shared secret for both signing and verifying the signature. This JWS uses "attached"
content, meaning the encoded header, payload, and signature are dot-concatenated to produce
the final JWS:
[ header ] . [ payload ] . [ signature ]
Use the <Payload> element to specify the raw, unencoded JWS payload.
In this example, a variable contains the payload. When this policy action is triggered,
Apigee encodes the JWS header and payload, then adds the encoded signature to digitally sign the JWS.
The policy configuration below creates a JWS from a payload contained in the variable
my-payload , and stores the resulting JWS in the variable
output-variable .
< GenerateJWS name = "JWS-Generate-HS256" >
< DisplayName>JWS Generate HS256 < / DisplayName >
< Algorithm>HS256 < / Algorithm >
< IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>false < / IgnoreUnresolvedVariables >

< Id>1918290 < / Id >
< / SecretKey >
< Payload ref = "my-payload" / >
< OutputVariable>output - variable < / OutputVariable >
< / GenerateJWS >
Generate an HS256-signed JWT
This example also generates a JWS with attached content that is signed using the HS256
algorithm. In this case, the payload is JSON. Setting the typ header to JWT
results in a signed JWS that is also a signed JWT.
( reference )
The policy configuration below creates a JWS from a payload contained in the variable
json-content , and stores the resulting JWS in the variable
output-variable . The result will be a signed JWT if and only if the
json-content variable holds a JSON payload, and the properties within
that JSON payload are valid for JWT. For example, the exp property, if it is
present, must hold a numeric value. The aud property, if it is present,
must be a string or an array of strings. And so on. Consult
IETF RFC7519 for
details on the valid values for JWT claims.

Generate a detached JWS
This example policy generates a JWS with detached content, signed using the RS256 algorithm.
Generating an RS256 signature relies on an RSA private key, which must be provided in
PEM-encoded form.
A JWS with detached content omits the payload from the generated JWS:
[ header ] .. [ signature ]
See Parts
of a JWS/JWT for more on the structure and format of a JWS.
Use the <Payload> element to specify the raw, unencoded JWS payload.
When this policy is triggered, Apigee encodes the JWS header and payload, and then uses them
to generate the encoded signature. However, the generated JWS omits the encoded payload from
the serialized JWS. This is helpful when the signed content is large, or binary (such as an
image or PDF), or both. To allow validation, you must pass both elements, the JWS and the
payload that was included in the signed content, to the verifying party. If you are using the
VerifyJWS policy to verify the JWS, you can specify the variable containing the payload
with the <DetachedContent> element of the VerifyJWS policy.

< / GenerateJWS >
Note: You can use a slightly modified version of this
example to generate a JWS for the PS* or ES* algorithms. Just change the value of
<Algorithm>RS256</Algorithm> to PS256 , or
ES256 , etc. The key you specify must be compatible with the algorithm. For
more on the key requirements, see
About signature
encryption algorithms .
Setting the key elements
The elements that you use to specify the key used to generate the JWS depend on the chosen algorithm,
as shown in the following table:
Note: The RS*, PS*, and ES* algorithms all use the same
elements to specify the key. The key data you provide must be compatible with the
algorithm you specify. For more on the key requirements, see
About signature encryption algorithms .

Element reference for Generate JWS
The policy reference describes the elements and attributes of the Generate JWS policy.
Note: Configuration will differ somewhat depending on the encryption
algorithm you use. Refer to the Samples for examples that demonstrate
configurations for specific use cases.
Attributes that
apply to the top-level element
<GenerateJWS name="JWS" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" async="false">
The following attributes are common to all policy parent elements.
Attribute
Description
Default
Presence
name
The internal name of the policy. Characters you can use in the name are restricted to:
A-Z0-9._\-$ % . However, the Apigee UI enforces additional
restrictions, such as automatically removing characters that are not alphanumeric.
Optionally, use the <displayname></displayname> element to
label the policy in the Apigee UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language
name.
N/A
Required
continueOnError
Set to false to return an error when a policy fails. This is expected
behavior for most policies.
Set to true to have flow execution continue even after a policy
fails.
false
Optional
enabled
Set to true to enforce the policy.
Set to false to "turn off" the policy. The policy will not be enforced
even if it remains attached to a flow.
true
Optional
async
This attribute is deprecated.
false
Deprecated
<DisplayName>
<DisplayName>Policy Display Name</DisplayName>
Use in addition to the name attribute to label the policy in the Apigee UI proxy editor
with a different, natural-language name.
Default
If you omit this element, the value of the policy's name attribute is used.
Presence
Optional
Type
String
<Algorithm>
<Algorithm>algorithm-here</Algorithm>
Specifies the encryption algorithm to sign the token.
Default
N/A
Presence
Required
Type
String
Valid values
HS256, HS384, HS512, RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, PS256, PS384, PS512
<AdditionalHeaders/Claim>
< AdditionalHeaders >
< Claim name = 'claim1' > explicit - value - of - claim - here < / Claim >
< Claim name = 'claim2' ref = 'variable-name-here' / >
< Claim name = 'claim3' ref = 'variable-name-here' type = 'boolean' / >
< Claim name = 'claim4' ref = 'variable-name' type = 'string' array = 'true' / >
< / AdditionalHeaders >
Puts the additional claim name/value pair(s) in the header for the JWS.
The <Claim> element supports the dynamic string substitution feature called
message templating when type=map .
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Valid values
Any value that you want to use for an additional claim. You can specify
the claim explicitly as string, a number, a boolean, a map, or an array.
The <Claim> element takes these attributes:
name - (Required) The name of the claim, also known as the parameter.
ref - (Optional) The name of a flow variable. If present, the policy will use the value of this
variable as the claim. If both a ref attribute and an explicit claim value are specified, the
explicit value is the default, and is used if the referenced flow variable is unresolved.
Warning: When ref is used with
type = map and when the variable contains untrusted input (for example,
from request headers or query parameters), an attacker could inject template expressions. For
example, an attacker can use {private.secret} to extract sensitive data from the
message context. Protect against this risk. See
Prevent template injection when using JWS and JWT for more information.
type - (Optional) One of: string (default), number, boolean, or map
array - (Optional) Set to true to indicate if the value is an array of types. Default:
false.
<CriticalHeaders>
< CriticalHeaders>a , b , c < / CriticalHeaders >
or :
< CriticalHeaders ref = "variable_containing_headers" / >
Adds the critical header, crit , to the JWS. The crit header
is an array of header names that must be known and recognized by the JWS receiver. For example,
you can use this configuration element to produce a JWS header that when decoded, looks like
this:
{
"typ": "...",
"alg" : "...",
"hyb" : "some-value-here",
"crit" : [ "hyb" ],
}
This JWS header asserts that the hyb header parameter is of critical
importance, and any recipient of the JWS must understand the meaning and value of that
parameter.
Per IETF RFC 7515 , the recipient of a JWS should reject the JWS as
invalid if the recipient does not understand one or more of the parameters referenced in the
crit parameter. In Apigee, the VerifyJWS policy conforms to this behavior.
For each parameter listed in the crit parameter, it checks that the
<KnownHeaders> element of the VerifyJWS policy also lists that parameter.
Any header that the VerifyJWS policy finds in crit that is not also listed
in <KnownHeaders> causes the VerifyJWS policy to reject the JWS.
Note: It is nonsensical to include in the list of
CriticalHeaders any header parameters that do not exist in the actual JWS header. The
<CriticalHeaders> does not actually add the referenced parameters to the
JWS header. It only defines the contents of the crit parameter. You can use
the <AdditionalHeader/Claims> to add the referenced header claims or
parameters.
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Type
Comma separated array of one or more strings
Valid values
Either an array or a reference to a variable containing the array.
<DetachContent>
<DetachContent>true|false</DetachContent>
Specifies whether to generate the JWS with a detached payload, <DetachContent>true</DetachContent> ,
or not, <DetachContent>false</DetachContent> .
If you specify false, the default, the generated JWS is in the form:
[ header ] . [ payload ] . [ signature ]
If you specify true to create a JWS with a detached payload, the generated JWS omits the
payload and is in the form:
[ header ] .. [ signature ]
With a JWS using a detached payload, it is up to you to pass the original unencoded payload to
the verifying party, along with the serialized JWS.
Default
false
Presence
Optional
Type
Boolean
Valid values
true or false
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true|false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
Set to false if you want the policy to throw an error when any referenced variable specified
in the policy is unresolvable. Set to true to treat any unresolvable variable as an empty string
(null).
Default
false
Presence
Optional
Type
Boolean
Valid values
true or false
<OutputVariable>
< OutputVariable>output - variable < / OutputVariable >
Specifies the name of the context variable that the policy will set with the generated JWS.
By default, the policy places the JWS into the context variable named
jws. POLICYNAME .generated_jws .
Default
jws. POLICYNAME .generated_jws
Presence
Optional
Type
String (a flow variable name)
<Payload>
< Payload ref = "flow-variable-name-here" / >
or
< Payload> payload - value < / Payload >
Specifies the raw, unencoded JWS payload. Specify a variable containing the payload, or a string.
The <Payload> element supports the dynamic string
substitution feature called
message templating . A
message template permits you to perform variable string substitution in the
payload-value string. In the following example, the payload would be constructed
from a combination of text and the value of a variable.
< Payload>fixed - text - { request . formparam . payload } - more - fixed - text < / Payload >
Warning: When ref is used with the
<Payload> element, an attacker could inject template expressions. For
example, an attacker can use {private.secret} to extract sensitive data from the
message context. Protect against this risk. See
Prevent template injection when using JWS and JWT for more information.
Default
N/A
Presence
Required
Type
String, byte array, stream, or any other representation of the unencoded JWS payload.
Valid values
Either a message template, or a reference to a variable containing the payload.
<PrivateKey> element
This is optional, for use only when the <Algorithm> is one of the RS*, PS*,
or ES* options. It specifies the private key to use for signing, as well as other information
related to the private key. It is used when the algorithm is an asymmetric algorithm.
<PrivateKey>
<Value ref="private.privatekey"</Value>
</PrivateKey>
Default:
N/A
Presence:
Optional. However, you must include exactly one of either the
<PrivateKey> or <SecretKey> element.
Use the <PrivateKey> element when the algorithm is RS*, PS*, or ES*,
and use the <SecretKey> element when the algorithm is HS*.
Type:
N/A
<PrivateKey/Id>
< PrivateKey >
< Id ref = "flow-variable-name-here" / >
< / PrivateKey >
or
< PrivateKey >
< Id>your - id - value - here < / Id >
< / PrivateKey >
Specifies the key ID (kid) to include in the JWS header.
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Type
String
Valid values
A flow variable or string
<PrivateKey/Password>
<PrivateKey>
<Password ref="private.privatekey-password"/>
</PrivateKey>
Specify the password the policy should use to decrypt the private key, if necessary. Use the
ref attribute to pass the key in a flow variable.
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Type
String
Valid values
A flow variable reference. Note: You must specify a flow variable
with the ref attribute. Apigee will reject as invalid a policy
configuration in which the password is specified in plaintext. The flow variable
must have the prefix "private". For example, private.mypassword
<PrivateKey/Value>
< PrivateKey >
< Value ref = "private.variable-name-here" / >
< / PrivateKey >
Specifies a PEM-encoded private key used to sign the JWS. Use the ref attribute to pass the
key in a flow variable.
Default
N/A
Presence
Required when using the policy to generate a JWS using one of the RS*, PS*, or
ES* algorithms.
Type
String
Valid values
A flow variable containing a string representing a PEM-encoded private key value.
Note: The flow variable must have the prefix "private". For example,
private.mykey
<SecretKey>
< SecretKey encoding = "base16|hex|base64|base64url" >
< Id ref = "variable-containing-key-id-here" > secret - key - id < / Id >
< Value ref = "private.variable-here" / >
< / SecretKey >
Specifies the secret key to use when
generating a JWS that uses a symmetric (HS*) algorithm, one of HS256,
HS384, or HS512.
This element is optional. However, you must include exactly one of either the
<PrivateKey> or <SecretKey> element.
Use the <PrivateKey> element when generating a JWS signed with
an asymmetric algorithm (one of RS*, PS*, or ES*),
and use the <SecretKey> element when generating a JWS signed with a
symmetric algorithm (algorithm like HS*).
Children of <SecretKey>
The following table provides a description of the child elements and attributes of
<SecretKey> :
Child
Presence
Description
encoding (attribute)
Optional
Specifies how the key is encoded in the referenced variable. By default, when no
encoding attribute is present, the encoding of the key is treated as UTF-8.
Valid values for the attribute are: hex, base16, base64, or base64url.
The encoding values hex and base16 are synonyms.
< SecretKey encoding = "hex" >
< Id ref = "variable-containing-key-id-here" > secret - key - id < / Id >
< Value ref = "private.secretkey" / >
< / SecretKey >
In the above example, because the encoding is hex , if the contents of
the variable private.secretkey is 494c6f766541504973 , the key
will be decoded as a set of 9 bytes, which in hex will be
49 4c 6f 76 65 41 50 49 73 .
Note: Apigee enforces a minimum key strength. See the
documentation for the Value element for details.
Id (element)
Optional
The key identifier. The value can be any string. You can specify the value as a
literal text value, or indirectly, via a variable reference, with the ref
attribute.
< SecretKey >
< Id ref = "flow-variable-name-here" / >
< Value ref = "private.variable-here" / >
< / SecretKey >
or
< SecretKey >
< Id>your - id - value - here < / Id >
< Value ref = "private.variable-here" / >
< / SecretKey >
The policy will include this key identifier as the kid claim
in the header of the generated JWS.
Value (element)
Required
An encoded secret key. Specifies the secret key used to sign the payload.
Use the ref attribute
to provide the key indirectly via a variable, such as private.secret-key .
< SecretKey >
< Id ref = "flow-variable-name-here" / >
< Value ref = "private.my-secret-variable" / >
< / SecretKey >
Note: The variable name must include the private
prefix as shown in the example above.
Apigee enforces a minimum key strength for the HS256/HS384/HS512 algorithms. The minimum key length
for HS256 is 32 bytes, for HS384 it is 48 bytes, and for HS512 it is 64 bytes.
Using a lower-strength key causes a runtime error.
<Type>
< Type>type - string - here < / Type >
Optional element whose only allowed value is Signed , specifying that the policy
generates a signed JWS. <Type> is provided
just to match the corresponding element for the GenerateJWT and VerifyJWT policies (where
it can take on either of the values Signed or Encrypted ).

Flow variables
The Generate JWS policy does not set flow variables.
Error reference
This section describes the fault codes and error messages that are returned and fault variables that are set by Apigee when this policy triggers an error.
This information is important to know if you are developing fault rules to handle faults.
To learn more, see What you need to know about policy errors
and Handling faults .
Runtime errors
These errors can occur when the policy executes.
Use API Monitoring to investigate fault
codes and diagnose issues faster. See Set up a policy fault code alert
for an example. See Fault code reference for a complete
list of all fault codes that you can handle with API Monitoring.
