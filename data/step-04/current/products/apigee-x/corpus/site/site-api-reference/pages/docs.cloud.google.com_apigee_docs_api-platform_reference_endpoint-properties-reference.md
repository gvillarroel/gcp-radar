This topic describes transport properties that can be set in TargetEndpoint
and ProxyEndpoint
configurations to control messaging and connection behavior. For full coverage of
the TargetEndpoint
and ProxyEndpoint configuration options, see API proxy configuration reference .
TargetEndpoint Transport Properties
The HTTPTargetConnection element in TargetEndpoint configurations
defines a set of HTTP
transport properties. You can use these properties to set transport-level configurations.
Properties are set on TargetEndpoint HTTPTargetConnection elements
as shown in this example configuration:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net</URL>
<Properties>
<Property name="request.retain.headers">User-Agent,Referer,Accept-Language</Property>
<Property name="retain.queryparams">apikey</Property>
</Properties>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
Note: Property values can only be literals. You cannot set values
using variables.
TargetEndpoint Transport Property
Specification
Property Name
Default Value
Description
allow.post.without.content.length
false
Lets you send POST requests with no content in the body.
allow.put.without.content.length
false
Lets you send PUT requests with no content in the body.
allow.tls.session.resumption
true
If true (the default) clients reuse TLS sessions when making new connections to the target.
Set to false if you do not want TLS session reuse. Session reuse generally
means shorter connection times, but some targets may not support session reuse or have
difficulty with it.
keepalive.timeout.millis
60000
Connection idle timeout for the target connection in the connection pool. If the
connection in the pool is idle beyond the specified limit, then the connection is
closed.
connect.timeout.millis
3000
Target connection timeout. Apigee returns an HTTP 503 status code if a
connection timeout occurs. In some cases an HTTP 504 status code may be
returned when LoadBalancer is used in the TargetServer definition
and a timeout
occurs.
Note: In some cases, Apigee will automatically retry the connection up to three times.
As a result, the total retry time may exceed what is configured for connect.timeout.millis .
ignore.allow.header.for.405
true
Lets you pass the 405 status code back to the client. By enabling
the flag Apigee will return 405 instead of 502 status code.
io.timeout.millis
55000
If there is no data to read for the specified number of milliseconds, or if the socket
is not ready to write data for a specified number of milliseconds, then the transaction is
treated as a timeout.
If a timeout happens while reading the HTTP request from ingress,
408 Request Timeout is retuned.
408 Request Timeout will not be returned if a timeout
happens while writing a request to the target.
If a timeout happens while writing the HTTP request or reading the
HTTP response, 504 Gateway Timeout
is returned.
See Setting io.timeout.millis and api.timeout .
supports.http11
true
If this is true and the client sends a 1.1 request, the target is also sent a
1.1
request, otherwise 1.0 request is sent to the target.
use.proxy
true
If the Apigee hybrid overrides file contains the HTTP_PROXY configuration,
as described in Configure forward proxying for API proxies , then use
this property to manage/control which proxies should
not use the proxy configuration.
If set to false , the API Proxy will skip the HTTP proxy configurations specified
in the Apigee hybrid overrides file for target connections set
in the proxy.
use.proxy.tunneling
true
If this is set to true, and proxy configurations are specified
Apigee hybrid overrides file
as described in Configure forward proxying for API proxies ,
then target connections are set to use the specified tunnel. If the target
uses TLS/SSL, then this property is ignored, and the message is always sent using a tunnel.
use.proxy.host.header.with.target.uri
true
Sets the target host and port as a Host header. By default, the proxy host and port
are set as Host headers. You can only set this property in the
Target Endpoint. For example:
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<Properties>
<Property name="use.proxy.host.header.with.target.uri">true</Property>
</Properties>
<URL>https://mocktarget.apigee.net/my-target</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
response.payload.
parse.limit
10M
By default ( 10M ). Use the property response.payload.parse.limit to set the maximum payload size that can be processed in the response flow, in megabytes (M). The minimum configurable limit is 10M and the maximum configurable limit is 30M. If the property is not set, the default limit is 10M.
See also
Message payload size .
request.streaming.enabled
false
By default ( false ), HTTP request payloads are read into a buffer, and
policies that
can operate on the payload work as expected. In cases where the payloads are larger than
the buffer size (10 MB in Apigee), you can set this
attribute to true . When true , HTTP request payloads are not read
into a buffer; they are
streamed as-is to the target endpoint. In this case, any policies that operate on the
payload in the TargetEndpoint request flow are bypassed. See also
Streaming requests and
responses .
response.streaming.enabled
false
By default (false), HTTP response payloads are read into a buffer, and policies that
can operate on the payload work as expected. In cases where the payloads are larger than
the buffer size (10 MB in Apigee), you can set this
attribute to true. When true, HTTP response payloads are not read into a buffer; they are
streamed as-is to the ProxyEndpoint response flow. In this case, any policies that
operate on the payload in the TargetEndpoint response flow are bypassed. See also
Streaming requests and
responses .
success.codes
N/A
By default, Apigee treats HTTP code 4XX or 5XX as errors, and
it treats HTTP code
1XX , 2XX , 3XX as success. This property enables
explicit definition of success codes, for
example, 2XX, 1XX, 505 treats any 100 , 200 and
505 HTTP response codes as
success.
Setting this property overwrites the default values. Therefore, if you want to add
HTTP code 400 to the list of default success codes, set this property as:
<Property name="success.codes">1xx,2xx,3xx,400</Property>
If you want only HTTP code 400 to be treated as a success code, set the property
as:
<Property name="success.codes">400</Property>
By setting HTTP code 400 as the only success code, the codes
1xx , 2xx , and 3xx are treated as failures.
compression.algorithm
N/A
By default, Apigee honors the compression type set (gzip, deflate or none) for messages
received. If the request is received from the client using, for example, gzip
compression, then Apigee forwards the request to the target using gzip compression. If
the response received from target uses deflate, then Apigee forwards the response to
the client using deflate. Supported values are:
gzip: always send message using gzip compression
deflate: always send message using deflate compression
none: always send message without any compression
See also: Does Apigee support compression/de-compression with GZIP/deflate compression?
request.retain.headers.
enabled
true
By default, Apigee always retains all HTTP headers on outbound messages. When set
to true , all HTTP headers present on the inbound request are set on the
outbound request.
request.retain.headers
N/A
Defines specific HTTP headers from the request that should be set on the outbound
request to the target service. For example, to passthrough the User-Agent
header, set the value of request.retain.headers to User-Agent .
Multiple HTTP headers are specified as a comma-separated list, for example,
User-Agent,Referer,Accept-Language . This property overrides
request.retain.headers.enabled . If request.retain.headers.enabled
is set to false , any headers specified in the
request.retain.headers property are still set on the outbound message.
response.retain.headers.
enabled
true
By default, Apigee always retains all HTTP headers on outbound messages. When set
to true , all HTTP headers present on the inbound response from the target
service are set on the outbound response before it is passed to the
ProxyEndpoint .
response.retain.headers
N/A
Defines specific HTTP headers from the response that should be set on the outbound
response before it is passed to the ProxyEndpoint . For example, to
passthrough the
Expires header, set the value of response.retain.headers to
Expires . Multiple HTTP headers are specified as a comma-separated list, for
example, Expires,Set-Cookie . This property overrides
response.retain.headers.enabled . If
response.retain.headers.enabled is set to false , any headers
specified in the response.retain.headers property are still set on the
outbound message.
retain.queryparams.
enabled
true
By default, Apigee always retains all query parameters on outbound requests. When
set to true , all query parameters present on the inbound request are set on
the outbound request to the target service.
retain.queryparams
N/A
Defines specific query parameters to set on the outbound request. For example, to
include the query parameter apikey from the request message, set
retain.queryparams to apikey . Multiple query parameters are
specified as a comma-separated list, for example, apikey,environment . This
property overrides retain.queryparams.enabled .
ProxyEndpoint Transport Properties
ProxyEndpoint HTTPTargetConnection elements define a set of HTTP
transport properties. These
properties can be used to set transport-level configurations.
Properties are set on ProxyEndpoint HTTPProxyConnection elements
as shown in this example configuration:
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
<HTTPProxyConnection>
<BasePath>/v1/weather</BasePath>
<Properties>
<Property name="request.streaming.enabled">true</Property>
</Properties>
</HTTPProxyConnection>
</ProxyEndpoint>
Request headers
An incoming HTTP request includes the HTTP headers sent by the client.
Headers with names that match the X-Apigee-* pattern are removed from incoming
requests if a client sends them. This name pattern is reserved for Apigee.
ProxyEndpoint Transport Property
Specification
Property Name
Default Value
Description
X-Forwarded-For
false
When set to true, the virtual host's IP address is added to the outbound request as the
value of the HTTP X-Forwarded-For header.
request.streaming.
enabled
false
By default ( false ), HTTP request payloads are read into a buffer, and
policies that can
operate on the payload work as expected. In cases where the payloads are larger than the
buffer size (10 MB in Apigee), you can set this
attribute to true . When true , HTTP request payloads are not read
into a buffer; they are
streamed as-is to the TargetEndpoint request flow. In this case, any policies
that operate
on the payload in the ProxyEndpoint request flow are bypassed. See also
Streaming requests and
responses .
request.payload.
parse.limit
10M
By default ( 10M ). Use the property request.payload.parse.limit to set the maximum payload size that can be processed in the request flow, in megabytes (M). The minimum configurable limit is 10M and the maximum configurable limit is 30M. If the property is not set, the default limit is 10M.
See also
Message payload size .
response.streaming.
enabled
false
By default (false), HTTP response payloads are read into a buffer, and policies that
can operate on the payload work as expected. In cases where the payloads are larger than
the buffer size (10 MB in Apigee), you can set this
attribute to true . When true , HTTP response payloads are not read
into a buffer; they are
streamed as-is to the client. In this case, any policies that operate on the payload in the
ProxyEndpoint response flow are bypassed. See also
Streaming requests and
responses .
compression.algorithm
N/A
By default, Apigee honors the compression type set (gzip, deflate or none) for messages received. For
example, where a client submits a request that uses gzip compression, Apigee
forwards the request to the target using gzip compression. You can configure compression
algorithms to be explicitly applied by setting this property on the
TargetEndpoint or ProxyEndpoint . Supported values are:
gzip: always send message using gzip compression
deflate: always send message using deflate compression
none: always send message without any compression
See also: Does Apigee support compression/de-compression with GZIP/deflate compression?
api.timeout
N/A
Configure the timeout for individual API proxies (in milliseconds)
You can configure API proxies, even those with
streaming enabled,
to time out after a specified time with a 504 Gateway
Timeout status.
Important: The specified timeout must be shorter than
the standard Message Processor timeout of 300 seconds.
For example, to configure a proxy to time out after 180000 milliseconds (three minutes),
add the following property to HTTPProxyConnection :
<Property name="api.timeout">180000</Property>
You cannot set this property with a variable.
See Setting io.timeout.millis and api.timeout .
HTTPHeader.allowDuplicates
N/A
Use this setting to allow duplicate headers (for specific headers).
<HTTPProxyConnection>
<Properties>
<Property name="HTTPHeader.allowDuplicates">Content-Type,Authorization</Property>
</Properties>
</HTTPProxyConnection>
HTTPHeader.multiValued
N/A
Use this setting to allow duplicate headers (for specific headers).
<HTTPProxyConnection>
<Properties>
<Property name="HTTPHeader.multiValued">Content-Type,Authorization</Property>
</Properties>
</HTTPProxyConnection>
Setting io.timeout.millis and api.timeout
The operation of io.timeout.millis and api.timeout
are related. On every request to an API proxy:
The Ingress (aka Internal Load Balancer) sends its timeout value to the Message Processor.
This timeout value defaults to 300 seconds and is not configurable.
The Message Processor then sets api.timeout :
If api.timeout is not set at the proxy level, use the
timeout set by the Ingress.
If api.timeout is set at the proxy level, set it on the Message Processor
to the
lesser of the Ingress timeout or the value of api.timeout .
The value of api.timeout specifies the maximum amount of time an API proxy has
to execute from the API request to the response.
After each policy in the API proxy executes,
or before the Message Processor sends the request to the target endpoint,
the Message Processor calculates ( api.timeout - elapsed time from the start of the
request).
If the value is less than zero, then the maximum amount of time to handle the request has
expired and the Message Processor returns a 504 Gateway Timeout .
The value of io.timeout.millis specifies the maximum amount of time that the
target endpoint has to respond.
Before connecting to a target endpoint, the Message Processor determines the lesser of
( api.timeout - elapsed time from the start of the request) and io.timeout.millis .
It then sets io.timeout.millis to that value.
If a timeout happens while writing the HTTP request or reading the
HTTP response, 504 Gateway Timeout is returned.
