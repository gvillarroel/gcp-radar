AccessEntity policy
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Extensible policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
The AccessEntity policy retrieves entity profiles you specify from the Apigee data store. The
policy places the profile in a variable whose name follows the format
AccessEntity.{policy_name} . You can use AccessEntity to access
profiles for the following entities:
App
API product
Consumer key
Developer
Note: Apigee keeps the entities in cache
for a minimum of 180 seconds after the entities are accessed .
The AccessEntity policy functions as a policy-based runtime database lookup. You
can use the profile information returned by this policy to enable dynamic behavior, such as
conditional endpoint routing, flow execution, policy enforcement.
Use the AccessEntity policy to get entity profile data as
XML (or JSON in Apigee hybrid) and put it into a variable. Identify the entity
to get by specifying an entity
type and one or more identifiers that specify which entity of that type you want. Later, in
another policy, you can retrieve the entity profile data with another policy, such as an
ExtractVariables policy or AssignMessage policy .
This policy is an Extensible policy and use of this policy might have cost or
utilization implications, depending on your Apigee license. For information on policy types
and usage implications, see
Policy types .
Note: For XML examples representing entity profiles, see
Example entity profile XML .
Access AppGroups entities from AccessEntity
You can also use AccessEntity to retrieve AppGroup entities. See
Supported entity types and identifiers for related entities.
For information about AppGroups and supported functionality, see
Using AppGroups to organize app ownership .
Samples
The following samples show AccessEntity used in conjunction with the
ExtractVariables and AssignMessage policies to extract a developer's
email and add it to the HTTP header.
Getting developer email for use in other policies
Set up the AccessEntity policy to specify which entity profile to get from
Apigee, as well as where to put the profile data.
In the following example the policy gets a developer entity profile, using an
API key passed as a query param to identify the developer. The profile is placed in a
variable whose name follows the form AccessEntity.{policy_name} . So the variable
set by this policy would be AccessEntity.GetDeveloperProfile .
< AccessEntity name = "GetDeveloperProfile" >
< ! -- This is the type entity whose profile we need to pull from the Apigee datastore . -- >
< EntityType value = "developer" / >
< ! -- We tell the policy to use the API key ( presented as query parameter ) to identify the developer . -- >
< EntityIdentifier ref = "request.queryparam.apikey" type = "consumerkey" / >
< / AccessEntity >
Use another policy to retrieve the entity profile value from the variable set by
AccessEntity .
In the following example, an ExtractVariables policy retrieves a value from
the AccessEntity.GetDeveloperProfile variable set earlier by
AccessEntity .
Note that the value retrieved is specified as an XPath expression in the
XMLPayload element. The extracted value is placed in a
developer.email variable.
< ExtractVariables name = "SetDeveloperProfile" >
< !-- The source element points to the variable populated by AccessEntity policy .
The format is < policy - type > . < policy - name > .
In this case , the variable contains the whole developer profile . -- >
< Source>AccessEntity . GetDeveloperProfile < / Source >
< VariablePrefix>developer < / VariablePrefix >
< XMLPayload >
< Variable name = "email" type = "string" >
< !-- You parse elements from the developer profile using XPath . -- >
< XPath > / Developer / Email < / XPath >
< / Variable >
< / XMLPayload >
< / ExtractVariables >
The following AssignMessage policy retrieves the developer email set by the
ExtractVariables policy .
< !-- We 'll use this policy to return the variables set in the developer profile,
just so that we can easily see them in the response . -- >
< AssignMessage name = "EchoVariables" >
< AssignTo createNew = "false" type = "response" >< / AssignTo >
< IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true < / IgnoreUnresolvedVariables >
< Set >
< Headers >
< Header name = "X-Developer-email" > { developer . email } < / Header >
< / Headers >
< / Set >
< / AssignMessage >
Element reference
The basic of structure of an AccessEntity policy is:
< AccessEntity name = "policy_name" >
< EntityType value = "entity_type" / >
< EntityIdentifier ref = "entity_identifier" type = "identifier_type" / >
< SecondaryIdentifier ref = "secondary_identifier" type = "identifier_type" / >
< / AccessEntity >
You can access multiple entities of the same type by grouping them in an
Identifiers element:
< AccessEntity name = "name_of_the_policy" >
< EntityType value = "type_of_entity" / >
< Identifiers >
< Identifier >
< EntityIdentifier ref = "reference_to_entity_identifier" type *= "identifier_type" / >
< SecondaryIdentifier ref = "reference_to_secondary_entity_identifier" type = "identifier_type" / >< ! -- optional -- >
< / Identifier >
< Identifier >
< EntityIdentifier ref = "reference_to_entity_identifier" type *= "identifier_type" / >
< SecondaryIdentifier ref = "reference_to_secondary_entity_identifier" type = "identifier_type" / >< ! -- optional -- >
< / Identifier >
< / Identifiers >
< / AccessEntity >

the management UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language name.

Usage notes
Narrowing results with secondary identifiers
For some entities, giving one identifier might not be specific enough to get the entity you
want. In those cases, you can use a secondary identifier to narrow the results.
Note: Where multiple matches exist for a given
EntityIdentifier and SecondaryIdentifier combination, the first match
will be populated in the flow. For example, consider a case in which you're wanting to get an API
product profile by using an app ID.
Your first, possibly broad policy configuration might look like this:
< ? xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8" standalone = "yes" ? >
< AccessEntity async = "false" continueOnError = "false" enabled = "true" name = "GetApp" >
< DisplayName>GetAppProfile < / DisplayName >
< EntityType value = "apiproduct" >< / EntityType >
< EntityIdentifier ref = "request.queryparam.apikey" type = "consumerkey" / >
< / AccessEntity >
Because an app can be associated with multiple API products, using just the app ID might not
return the API product you want (you could get just the first of multiple matched products).
Instead, to get a more exact result, you could use a SecondaryIdentifier . For
example, you might have appname and developerid variables in the flow
because these are populated by default during an OAuth 2.0 exchange. You could use the values of
those variables in an AccessEntity policy to get profile details on the requesting
app.
Your more specific policy configuration might look like this:
< ? xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8" standalone = "yes" ? >
< AccessEntity async = "false" continueOnError = "false" enabled = "true" name = "GetApp" >
< DisplayName>GetAppProfile < / DisplayName >
< EntityType value = "apiproduct" >< / EntityType >
< EntityIdentifier ref = "developer.app.name" type = "appname" / >
< SecondaryIdentifier ref = "developer.id" type = "developerid" / >
< / AccessEntity >

Example entity profile XML
To retrieve the entity profile value you want with XPath, you'll need to know something about
the profile XML's structure. For an example of the structure, use a Apigee API call to get
XML for the entity you want. For details, refer to the Apigee API
reference .
The following sections include code for API calls, along with example XML from the call.

Flow variables
When the entity profile specified in the AccessEntity policy is retrieved, the
profile object is added to the message context as a variable. It can be accessed like any other
variable, with reference to the variable name. The user-provided name of the AccessEntity policy
is set as the variable prefix of the variable name.
For example, if an AccessEntity policy with name of GetDeveloper is executed,
then the profile is stored in the variable named
AccessEntity.GetDeveloper . The profile can then be parsed using an
XPath defined in an ExtractVariables policy that specifies AccessEntity.GetDeveloper
as its source.
