GenerateSAMLAssertion policy
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Extensible policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
The GenerateSAMLAssertion policy enables API proxies to attach SAML assertions to outbound XML requests.
Those assertions are then available to backend services to apply further security
processing for authentication and authorization. See SAML policies overview for more information.
This policy is an Extensible policy and use of this policy might have cost or
utilization implications, depending on your Apigee license. For information on policy types
and usage implications, see
Policy types .

Element reference
This section lists the elements and attributes of the GenerateSAMLAssertion policy.
Attributes that
apply to the top-level element
<GenerateSAMLAssertion name="SAML-A1" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" async="false">
The following attributes are common to all policy parent elements.
Attribute
Description
Default
Presence
name
The internal name of the policy. Characters you can use in the name are restricted to:
A-Z0-9._\-$ % . However, the Apigee UI enforces additional
restrictions, such as automatically removing characters that are not alphanumeric.
Optionally, use the <displayname></displayname> element to
label the policy in the Apigee UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language
name.
N/A
Required
enabled
Set to true to enforce the policy.
Set to false to "turn off" the policy. The policy will not be enforced
even if it remains attached to a flow.
true
Optional
Elements and attributes for SAML assertion generation
Field Name
Description
ignoreContentType attribute
A boolean that can be set to true or false . By default, the
assertion will not be generated if the content type of the message is not an XML
Content-Type. If this is set to true , then the message will be treated as XML
regardless of the Content-type.
Issuer
The unique identifier of the identity provider. If the optional ref
attribute is present, then the value of Issuer will be assigned at runtime based on the
specified variable. If the optional ref attribute is not present, then the
value of Issuer will be used.
KeyStore
The name of the KeyStore that contains the private key and the alias of the private key
used to digitally sign SAML assertions.
OutputVariable
Specifies where the generated SAML assertion will be placed. The assertion can be stored
in a flow variable or inserted into an existing message.
FlowVariable
Specifies the name of the flow variable where the generated SAML assertion content will be stored.
This is an alternative to using the <Message> element to insert the assertion
into an existing XML message.
Message
The target of the policy. Valid values are message , request ,
and response . When set to message , the policy conditionally
retrieves the message object based on the attachment point of the policy. When attached to
the request Flow, the policy resolves message to request, and when attached to
the response Flow, the policy resolves message to response.
XPath
An XPath expression that indicates the element on the outbound XML document to which
the policy will attach the SAML assertion.
SignatureAlgorithm
SHA1 or SHA256
Subject
The unique identifier of the subject of the SAML assertion. If the optional
ref attribute is present, then the value of Subject will be assigned at
runtime based on the specified variable. If the optional ref attribute is
not present, then the value of Subject will be used.
Template
If present, then the assertion will be generated by running this template, replacing
everything denoted {} with the corresponding variable, and then digitally
signing the result. The template is processed following the AssignMessage policy rules.
See AssignMessage policy .
The <Template> element supports the dynamic string substitution feature called
message templating . Message templating
is only supported when the policy signature is GenerateSamlAssertion .
Usage notes
Policy processing:
If the message is not XML, and ignoreContentType is not set to true , then
raise a fault.
If Template is set, then process the template as described for the AssignMessage policy.
If any variables are missing and ignoreUnresolvedVariables is not set, then raise a fault.
If Template is not set, then construct an assertion that includes the values of the
Subject and Issuer parameters or their references.
Sign the assertion using the specified key.
Add the assertion to the message at the specified XPath.
Error reference
This section describes the fault codes and error messages that are returned
and fault variables that are set by Apigee when this policy triggers an error.
This information is important to know if you are developing fault rules to
handle faults. To learn more, see What you need to know
about policy errors and Handling
faults .
Deployment errors
These errors can occur when you deploy a proxy containing this policy.
Tip: Need help resolving an error? Click
build
in the Fix column for detailed troubleshooting information.
Error name
Cause
Fix
SourceNotConfigured
One or more of the following elements of the ValidateSAMLAssertion
policy is not defined or empty: <Source> , <XPath> ,
<Namespaces> , <Namespace> .
build
TrustStoreNotConfigured
If the <TrustStore> element is empty or not specified in the
ValidateSAMLAssertion policy, then the deployment of the API proxy fails.
A valid truststore is required.
build
NullKeyStoreAlias
If the child element <Alias> is empty or not specified in the <Keystore>
element of GenerateSAMLAssertion policy, then the deployment of the API
proxy fails. A valid keystore alias is required.
build
NullKeyStore
If the child element <Name> is empty or not specified in the <Keystore>
element of GenerateSAMLAssertion policy, then the deployment of the API
proxy fails. A valid keystore name is required.
build
NullIssuer
If the <Issuer> element is empty or not specified in the
GenerateSAMLAssertion policy, then the deployment of the API proxy fails. A
valid <Issuer> value is required.
build
Fault variables
These variables are set when a runtime error occurs. For more information, see What you need to know
about policy errors .
Variables
Where
Example
fault.name=" fault_name "
fault_name is the name of the fault Runtime errors table above -->. The fault name is the last part of the fault code.
fault.name = "InvalidMediaTpe"
GenerateSAMLAssertion.failed
For a validate SAML assertion policy configuration, the error prefix is
ValidateSAMLAssertion .
GenerateSAMLAssertion.failed = true
Example error response
Note: For error handling, the best practice is to trap the
errorcode part of the error response. Do not rely on the text in the
faultstring , because it could change.
{
"fault" : {
"faultstring" : "GenerateSAMLAssertion[GenSAMLAssert]: Invalid media type" ,
"detail" : {
"errorcode" : "steps.saml.generate.InvalidMediaTpe"
}
}
}
Example fault rule
<FaultRules>
<FaultRule name="invalid_saml_rule">
<Step>
<Name>invalid-saml</Name>
</Step>
<Condition>(GenerateSAMLAssertion.failed = "true")</Condition>
</FaultRule>
</FaultRules>
