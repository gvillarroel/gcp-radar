GenerateJWT policy

Extensible policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
The GenerateJWT policy generates a signed JWT or an encrypted JWT, with a configurable set of
claims. The JWT can then be returned to clients, transmitted to backend targets, or used in
other ways. See JWS and JWT policies overview for a detailed
introduction.
Whether the policy generates a signed or encrypted JWT depends on the element you use
to specify the algorithm that generates the JWT:
If you use the <Algorithm> element,
the policy generates a signed JWT .
If you use the <Algorithms>
element, the policy generates an encrypted JWT .
This policy is an Extensible policy and use of this policy might have cost or
utilization implications, depending on your Apigee license. For information on policy types
and usage implications, see
Policy types .
Generate a Signed JWT
This section explains how to generate a signed JWT. For a signed JWT,
use the <Algorithm>
element to specify the algorithm for signing the key.
Samples for a signed JWT
The following samples illustrate how to generate a signed JWT.
HS256 algorithm
This example policy generates a new JWT and signs it using the HS256 algorithm. HS256 relies
on a shared secret for both signing and verifying the signature.
When this policy action is triggered, Apigee encodes the JWT header and payload, then digitally
signs the JWT. See the video above for a complete example, including how to make a request to the policy.
The policy configuration here will create a JWT with a set of standard claims as defined by
the JWT specification, including an expiry of 1 hour, as well as an additional claim. You can
include as many additional claims as you wish. See the Element reference for details on the
requirements and options for each element in this sample policy.
< GenerateJWT name = "JWT-Generate-HS256" >

The resulting JWT will have this header …
{
"typ" : "JWT",
"alg" : "HS256",
"kid" : "1918290"
}
… and will have a payload with contents something like this:
{
"sub" : "monty-pythons-flying-circus",
"iss" : "urn://apigee-JWT-policy-test",
"aud" : "fans",
"iat" : 1506553019,
"exp" : 1506556619,
"jti" : "BD1FF263-3D25-4593-A685-5EC1326E1F37",
"show": "And now for something completely different."
}
The value of the iat , exp , and jti claims
will vary.
RS256 algorithm
Note: Use this same example to generate a JWT for the
PS256 or ES256 algorithm. Just change the value of <Algorithm>RS256</Algorithm>
to PS256 or ES256 . For ES256 you also have to specify the a key
compatible with the algorithm. For more on the key requirements, see
About signature encryption algorithms .
This example policy generates a new JWT and signs it using the RS256 algorithm. Generating an
RS256 signature relies on an RSA private key, which must be provided in PEM-encoded form, and
which may be password-encrypted.
See the video above for a complete example, including how to make a request to the policy.
When this policy action is triggered, Apigee encodes and digitally signs the JWT, including the claims.
To learn about the parts of a JWT and how they are encrypted and signed, refer to RFC7519 .

The samples above use the <Algorithm> element, so they generate a signed
JWT. The <PrivateKey> element specifies the cryptographic key used
to sign the JWT. There
are other key elements as well. Which one you use depends on the algorithm specified by the
value of <Algorithm> , as described in the next section.
Setting the key elements for a signed JWT
Use exactly one of the following elements to specify the key used to generate a signed JWT:
<SecretKey>
<PrivateKey>
Which element you use depends on the chosen algorithm, as shown in the following table:
Note: The RS*, PS*, and ES* algorithms all use the same elements to specify the key,
but the ES* key data is different than that used by the RS* and PS* algorithms.

Generate an encrypted JWT
This section explains how to generate an encrypted JWT. For an encrypted JWT,
use the <Algorithms>
element to specify the algorithms for signing the key and content.
Sample for an encrypted JWT
The following sample shows how to generate an encrypted JWT.
The sample uses the <Algorithms> element, so it generates
an encrypted JWT.
RSA-OAEP-256
In the example below:
The key is encrypted with the RSA-OAEP-256 algorithm.
The content is encrypted with the A128GCM algorithm.
The <PublicKey> element specifies the key used for key encryption.

Element reference for Generate JWT
The policy reference describes the elements and attributes of the Generate JWT policy.
Note: Configuration will differ somewhat depending on the encryption
algorithm you use. Refer to Samples for a signed JWT
or Sample for an encrypted JWT
for examples that demonstrate
configurations for specific use cases.
Attributes that
apply to the top-level element
<GenerateJWT name="JWT" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" async="false">
The following attributes are common to all policy parent elements.
Attribute
Description
Default
Presence
name
The internal name of the policy. Characters you can use in the name are restricted to:
A-Z0-9._\-$ % . However, the Apigee UI enforces additional
restrictions, such as automatically removing characters that are not alphanumeric.
Optionally, use the <displayname></displayname> element to
label the policy in the Apigee UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language
name.
N/A

that resolves to an RSA Public key.
Content encryption algorithms
The following algorithms (symmetric, AES-based) are available for content encryption:
A128CBC-HS256
A192CBC-HS384
A256CBC-HS512
A128GCM
A192GCM
A256GCM
For more information on all of these algorithms, see
RFC7518 .
<Audience>
< Audience>audience - here < / Audience >
or :
< Audience ref = 'variable_containing_audience' / >
The policy generates a JWT containing an aud claim set to the specified
value. This claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. This is one of the
registered claims mentioned in RFC7519 .
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Type
Array (a list of comma-separated values)
Valid values
Anything that identifies the audience.
<AdditionalClaims/Claim>
< AdditionalClaims >
< Claim name = 'claim1' > explicit - value - of - claim - here < / Claim >
< Claim name = 'claim2' ref = 'variable-name-here' / >
< Claim name = 'claim3' ref = 'variable-name-here' type = 'boolean' / >
< / AdditionalClaims >
or :
< AdditionalClaims ref = 'claim_payload' / >
Lets you specify additional claim name/value pair(s) in the payload of the JWT. You can specify
the claim explicitly as string, a number, a boolean, a map, or an array. A map is simply a set of name/value
pairs.
The <Claim> element supports the dynamic string substitution feature called
message templating when type=map .
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Valid values
Any value that you want to use for an additional claim. You can specify
the claim explicitly as string, a number, a boolean, a map, or an array.
The <Claim> element takes these attributes:
name - (Required) The name of the claim.
Note: Do not use any of the registered claim names in this element.
The registered claims are specified in RFC7519 .
They include: "iss", "sub", "aud", "iat", "exp", "nbf", and "jti".
ref - (Optional) The name of a flow variable. If present, the policy will use the value of this
variable as the claim. If both a ref attribute and an explicit claim value are specified, the
explicit value is the default, and is used if the referenced flow variable is unresolved.
Warning: When ref is used with
type = map and when the variable contains untrusted input (for example,
from request headers or query parameters), an attacker could inject template expressions. For
example, an attacker can use {private.secret} to extract sensitive data from the
message context. Protect against this risk. See
Prevent template injection when using JWS and JWT for more information.
type - (Optional) One of: string (default), number, boolean, or map
array - (Optional) Set to true to indicate if the value is an array of types. Default:
false.
When you include the <Claim> element, the claim names are set statically when you
configure the policy. Alternatively, you can pass a JSON object to specify the claim names.
Because the JSON object is passed as a variable, the claim names in the generated JWT are determined at runtime.
For example:
<AdditionalClaims ref='json_claims'/>
Where the variable json_claims contains a JSON object
in the form:
{
"sub" : "person@example.com" ,
"iss" : "urn://secure-issuer@example.com" ,
"non-registered-claim" : {
"This-is-a-thing" : 817 ,
"https://example.com/foobar" : { "p" : 42 , "q" : false }
}
}
The generated JWT includes all of the claims in the JSON object.
It's important to note the following behavior with respect to using both a variable
reference and an explicit claim value in the Claim element:
Apigee will not generate a claim under these conditions:
if a variable reference present, but is unresolved, and
if you do not specify an explicit value (a default value), and
if the IgnoreUnresolvedVariables policy attribute is true .
If IgnoreUnresolvedVariables is false , then Apigee throws an error under the above
conditions.
Apigee will generate a claim under these conditions:
if a variable reference is present, but is unresolved, and
if you do specify an explicit value (a default value), and
if IgnoreUnresolvedVariables is either true or false
<AdditionalHeaders/Claim>
< AdditionalHeaders >
< Claim name = 'claim1' > explicit - value - of - claim - here < / Claim >
< Claim name = 'claim2' ref = 'variable-name-here' / >
< Claim name = 'claim3' ref = 'variable-name-here' type = 'boolean' / >
< Claim name = 'claim4' ref = 'variable-name' type = 'string' array = 'true' / >
< / AdditionalHeaders >
Puts the additional claim name/value pair(s) in the header for the JWT.
The <Claim> element supports the dynamic string substitution feature called
message templating when type=map .
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Valid values
Any value that you want to use for an additional claim. You can specify
the claim explicitly as string, a number, a boolean, a map, or an array.
The <Claim> element takes these attributes:
name - (Required) The name of the claim.
Note: Do not use any of the registered claim names in this element.
The registered claims are specified in RFC7519 .
They include: "iss", "sub", "aud", "iat", "exp", "nbf", and "jti".
ref - (Optional) The name of a flow variable. If present, the policy will use the value of this
variable as the claim. If both a ref attribute and an explicit claim value are specified, the
explicit value is the default, and is used if the referenced flow variable is unresolved.
Warning: When ref is used with
type = map and when the variable contains untrusted input (for example,
from request headers or query parameters), an attacker could inject template expressions. For
example, an attacker can use {private.secret} to extract sensitive data from the
message context. Protect against this risk. See
Prevent template injection when using JWS and JWT for more information.
type - (Optional) One of: string (default), number, boolean, or map
array - (Optional) Set to true to indicate if the value is an array of types. Default:
false.
<Compress>
<Compress>true</Compress>
Specifies whether text is compressed before encrypting.
This element is valid only when generating an encrypted JWT.
<CriticalHeaders>
< CriticalHeaders>a , b , c < / CriticalHeaders >
or :
< CriticalHeaders ref = ’ variable_containing_headers ’ / >
Adds the critical header, crit , to the JWT header. The crit header
is an array of header names that must be known and recognized by the JWT receiver. For example:
{
"typ": "...",
"alg" : "...",
"crit" : [ "a", "b", "c" ],
}
According to the specification, verifying parties must examine the crit header
and verify that each of those headers is understood. For example, the VerifyJWT policy examines the crit header.
For each item listed in the crit header, it checks that the <KnownHeaders> element
of the VerifyJWT policy also lists that header. Any header that the VerifyJWT policy finds in crit
that is not also listed in <KnownHeaders> causes the VerifyJWT policy to fail.
Note: The <CriticalHeaders> does not actually
add the headers to the JWT. It only defines the contents of the crit header.
You can use the <AdditionalHeader/Claims> to add the headers.
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Type
Comma separated array of strings
Valid values
Either an array or the name of a variable containing the array.
<CustomClaims>
Note: Currently, a CustomClaims element is inserted when you add a new
GenerateJWT policy through the UI. This element is not functional and is ignored. The correct
element to use instead is <AdditionalClaims> . The UI will
be updated to insert the correct elements at a later time.
<DirectKey>
<DirectKey>
<Id>A12345</Id>
<Value encoding="base16|hex|base64|base64url" ref="private.directkey"/>
</DirectKey>
Specifies a direct key for encrypting a JWT when the encryption algorithm is dir
("direct encryption").
Child elements of <DirectKey>
The following table provides a high-level description of the child elements of
<DirectKey> :
Child Element
Required?
Description
Id
Optional
Key identifier
Value
Required
Specify a reference to a variable with the ref attribute. The contents
of the referenced variable must be a string encoding of a byte array,
encoded via one of hex (base16), base64, or base64url.
With direct key encryption, you can directly supply a series of bytes that will act as the
content encryption key (CEK). You must specify the byte array as an encoded string.
The required length of the byte array depends on the strength of the content encryption
algorithm selected. For example, for A256CBC-HS512, you must supply a
key of exactly 512 bits, or 64 bytes.
The contents of the variable private.directkey must be a string that is encoded,
either via hex (base16), base64, or base64url. For example, here is a hex-encoded 32-byte key:
96 4 b e1 71 15 71 5 f 87 11 0 e 13 52 4 c ec 1 e ba df 47 62 1 a 9 d 3 b f5 ad d2 7 b b2 35 e7 d6 17 11
For the hex encoding, whitespace is accepted but not required, and upper or lowercase is
accepted (B7 is the same as b7).
The base64url-encoded equivalent of the above is:
lkvhcRVxX4cRDhNSTOweut9HYhqdO/Wt0nuyNefWFxE
For the base64* variants, whitespace is not accepted, and case matters.
If you don't specify an encoding, the policy assumes the encoding is base64.
The following describes the length of keys required:
Content Encryption Algorithm
Key length requirement
A128CBC-HS256
256 bits (32 bytes)
A192CBC-HS384
384 (48)
A256CBC-HS512
512 (64)
A128GCM
128 (16)
A192GCM
192 (24)
A256GCM
256 (32)
Note: The content-encryption key provided via the <DirectKey>
element must be exactly the
right length for the specified content-encryption algorithm. For any key-encryption
algorithm other than dir , the policy generates a random CEK that is the
right length, but for dir , the configuration needs to supply a key with
the right size explicitly.
<ExpiresIn>
<ExpiresIn>time-value-here</ExpiresIn>
or:
<ExpiresIn ref='time-value-here'/>
Specifies the lifespan of the JWT in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, or days. Specify
the expiration using either the XML element or the ref attribute, but not both.
Note: This is a timespan, not an absolute time value. The quantity can
be a simple numeric value, in which case it is interpreted as milliseconds.
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Type
Integer
Valid values
A value or a reference to a flow variable containing the value. Time units can be
specified as follows:
ms = milliseconds (default)
s = seconds
m = minutes
h = hours
d = days
For example, an ExpiresIn =10d is equivalent to an ExpiresIn of
864000s.
<Id>
< Id>explicit - jti - value - here < / Id >
- or -
< Id ref = 'variable-name-here' / >
- or -
< Id / >
Generates a JWT with the specific jti claim. When the text value and ref attribute are both
empty, the policy will generate a jti containing a random UUID. The JWT ID (jti) claim is a
unique identifier for the JWT. For more information on jti, refer to RFC7519 .
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Type
String, or reference.
Valid values
Either a string or the name of a flow variable containing the ID.
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true|false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
Set to false if you want the policy to throw an error when any referenced variable specified
in the policy is unresolvable. Set to true to treat any unresolvable variable as an empty string
(null).
Default
False
Presence
Optional
Type
Boolean
Valid values
true or false
<Issuer>
< Issuer ref = 'variable-name-here' / >
< Issuer>issuer - string - here < / Issuer >
The policy generates a JWT containing a claim with name iss, with a value set
to the specified value. A claim that identifies the issuer of the JWT. This is one of the
registered set of claims mentioned in RFC7519 .
Default
N/A

The encoded public key must denote an RSA key if you use the RSA-OAEP-256
algorithm, or an EC key of the appropriate curve if you use an EC algorithm.
Certificate
A PEM-encoded X.509 certificate, wrapping a public key. Apigee will extract
the public key from the certificate, and then use that key to encrypt the
content-encryption key. You may specify the certificate literally, or indirectly
via a variable reference.

< / Certificate >
< / PublicKey >
The encoded public key must denote an RSA key if you use the RSA-OAEP-256
algorithm, or an EC key of the appropriate curve if you use an EC algorithm.
Note: Apigee does not validate the validity dates on
the certificate you provide, nor does Apigee validate the trust chain on the
certificate. Apigee treats all certificates you specify with this element as
valid and trusted.
JWKS
A JWKS source of public keys. This will be a list of keys following the format
described in IETF RFC 7517 - JSON Web Key (JWK) .
You can specify the JWKS in one of four ways:
literally, as a text value:
< PublicKey >
< JWKS> jwks - content - here < / JWKS >
< Id ref = "variable-containing-a-kid" > literal - value - here < / Id >
< / PublicKey >
indirectly, with the ref attribute, specifying a flow variable:
< PublicKey >
< JWKS ref = "variable-containing-jwks-content" / >
< Id ref = "variable-containing-a-kid" > literal - value - here < / Id >
< / PublicKey >
The referenced variable should contain a string that represents a JWKS.
indirectly via a static uri, with the uri attribute:
< PublicKey >
< JWKS uri = "uri-that-returns-a-jwks" / >
< Id ref = "variable-containing-a-kid" > literal - value - here < / Id >
< / PublicKey >
indirectly via a dynamically-determined uri, with the uriRef attribute:
< PublicKey >
< JWKS uriRef = "variable-containing-a-uri-that-returns-a-jwks" / >
< Id ref = "variable-containing-a-kid" > literal - value - here < / Id >
< / PublicKey >
In all cases, when specifying a JWKS element within
GenerateJWT to generate an encrypted JWT, you must also specify the
PublicKey/Id element.
< PublicKey >
< JWKS uri = "uri-that-returns-a-jwks" / >
< Id ref = "variable-containing-a-kid" > literal - value - here < / Id >
< / PublicKey >
Id
A string representing the key identifier. At runtime, Apigee retrieves a key from
the JWKS that has a kid field that matches this value.
The Id element is required if you use the JWKS element within
GenerateJWT.
<SecretKey>
< SecretKey encoding = "base16|hex|base64|base64url" >
< Id ref = "variable-containing-key-id-here" > secret - key - id < / Id >
< Value ref = "private.variable-here" / >
< / SecretKey >
The SecretKey element is optional. It specifies the secret key to use when
generating a signed JWT that uses a symmetric (HS*) algorithm or when
generating an encrypted JWT that uses a symmetric (AES) algorithm for key
encryption.
Children of <SecretKey>
The following table provides a description of the child elements and attributes of
<SecretKey> :
Child
Presence
Description
encoding (attribute)
Optional
Specifies how the key is encoded in the referenced variable. By default, when no
encoding attribute is present, the encoding of the key is treated as UTF-8.
Valid values for the attribute are: hex, base16, base64, or base64url.
The encoding values hex and base16 are synonyms.
< SecretKey encoding = "VALUE_HERE" >
< Id ref = "variable-containing-key-id-here" > secret - key - id < / Id >
< Value ref = "private.secretkey" / >
< / SecretKey >
In the above example, when the encoding attribute is hex , and the contents of
the variable private.secretkey is 494c6f766541504973 , the key
will be decoded as a set of 9 bytes, which in hex will be 49 4c 6f 76 65 41 50 49
73 . Conversely, when the encoding attribute is base64 , and
the contents of the variable private.secretkey is
VGhpcy1pcy1hLXNlY3JldA , the key will be decoded as a set of 16 bytes, in hex:
54 68 69 73 2d 69 73 2d 61 2d 73 65 63 72 65 74 .
Note: Apigee enforces a minimum key strength. See the
documentation for the Value element for details.
Id (element)
Optional
The key identifier. The value can be any string. You can specify the value as a
literal text value, or indirectly, via a variable reference, with the ref
attribute.
< SecretKey >
< Id ref = "flow-variable-name-here" / >
< Value ref = "private.variable-here" / >
< / SecretKey >
or
< SecretKey >
< Id>your - id - value - here < / Id >
< Value ref = "private.variable-here" / >
< / SecretKey >
The policy will include this key identifier as the kid claim
in the header of the generated JWT.
Value (element)
Required
An encoded secret key. Specifies the secret key used to sign the payload.
Use the ref attribute
to provide the key indirectly via a variable, such as private.secret-key .
< SecretKey >
< Id ref = "flow-variable-name-here" / >
< Value ref = "private.my-secret-variable" / >
< / SecretKey >
Note: The variable name must include the private
prefix as shown in the example above.
Apigee enforces a minimum key strength for the HS256/HS384/HS512 algorithms. The minimum key length
for HS256 is 32 bytes, for HS384 it is 48 bytes, and for HS512 it is 64 bytes.
Using a lower-strength key causes a runtime error.
<Subject>
<Subject>subject-string-here</Subject>
or
< Subject ref = " flow_variable " / >
For example:
<Subject ref="apigee.developer.email"/>
The policy generates a JWT containing a sub claim, set to the specified
value.This claim identifies or makes a statement about the subject of the JWT. This is one of the
standard set of claims mentioned in
IETF RFC 7519 .
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Type
String
Valid values
Any value uniquely identifying a subject or a flow variable referring to a value.
<Type>
< Type>type - string - here < / Type >
Describes whether the policy generates a signed JWT or an encrypted JWT. The
<Type> element is optional. You can use it to inform readers of the
configuration whether the policy generates a signed or an encrypted JWT.
If the <Type> element is present:
If the value of <Type> is Signed ,
the policy generates a signed JWT, and the
<Algorithm> element must be present.
If the value of <Type> is Encrypted ,
the policy will generate an encrypted JWT, and the
<Algorithms> element
must be present.
If the <Type> element is absent:
If the <Algorithm> element
is present, the policy assumes <Type> is Signed .
If the <Algorithms> element is present, the policy assumes
<Type> is Encrypted .
If neither <Algorithm> nor <Algorithms> is present,
the configuration is invalid.
Default
N/A
Presence
Optional
Type
String
Valid values
Either Signed or Encrypted
Flow variables
The Generate JWT policy does not set flow variables.
Error reference
This section describes the fault codes and error messages that are returned and fault variables that are set by Apigee when this policy triggers an error.
This information is important to know if you are developing fault rules to
handle faults. To learn more, see What you need to know
about policy errors and Handling
faults .
Runtime errors
These errors can occur when the policy executes.
Use API Monitoring to investigate fault
codes and diagnose issues faster. See Set up a policy fault code alert
for an example. See Fault code reference for a complete
list of all fault codes that you can handle with API Monitoring.

JWT Policy Fault Codes
For error handling, the best practice is to trap the errorcode part of the error
response. Do not rely on the text in the faultstring , because it could change.
