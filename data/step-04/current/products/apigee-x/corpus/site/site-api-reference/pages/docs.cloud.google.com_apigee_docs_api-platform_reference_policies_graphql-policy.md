GraphQL policy
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Standard policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
The GraphQL policy parses GraphQL payloads into message flow
variables, verifies GraphQL requests against a schema, or both.
Use the GraphQL policy to:
Ensure that your APIs only process requests that conform to the schema you provide.
Impose restrictions on the payload by setting a maximum on the number of fragments allowed.
Associate GraphQL with API products.
Leverage the Oauth2, VerifyAPIKey, and Quota policy
features, just as in REST.
GraphQL supports the following types of payloads:
POST of graphQL payloads with Content-Type : application/graphql
POST of graphQL payloads with Content-Type: applcation/json
GET of graphQL payloads where the payload is a query parameter
Note: For application/json payloads of the form
{
"query": "...",
"operationName": "...",
"variables": { "myVariable": "someValue", ... }
}
Apigee currently ignores the optional operationName and variables fields.
For more information, see the following resources:
Introduction to GraphQL
Queries and Mutations
Flow variables reference
This policy is a Standard policy and can be deployed to any environment type. For
information on policy types and availability with each environment type, see
Policy types .
See Using GraphQL for an example
that uses this policy.
Caution: Verifying the payload against the schema is
generally an expensive operation, and we recommend considering this carefully
when deciding whether to perform schema validation.
Schema validation operations can be CPU intensive, especially when the payload and the schema
are complex, and can result in significant latencies.
Note: You can only provide one schema per policy. If you need to include
multiple schemas, add multiple GraphQL policies to your proxy.

This element has the following attributes that are common to all policies:
Attribute
Default

Description
name
N/A
Required
The internal name of the policy. The value of the name attribute can
contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, underscores, and periods. This value cannot
exceed 255 characters.
Optionally, use the <DisplayName> element to label the policy in
the management UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language name.
continueOnError
false
Optional
Set to false to return an error when a policy fails. This is expected behavior for
most policies. Set to true to have flow execution continue even after a policy
fails. See also:
Fault rules are triggered ONLY in an error state (about continueOnError)

Optional
Set to true to enforce the policy. Set to false to turn off the
policy. The policy will not be enforced even if it remains attached to a flow.

<Action>
Optional

parse_verify (both).
<MaxCount>
Optional
The maximum number of queries or fragments that a GraphQL request can spawn. The default value is
10.
<MaxDepth>

The maximum depth of the tree for the query. The default value is 4.
<MaxPayloadSizeInBytes>
Optional
The maximum size of a payload in kilobytes.

Optional
DESCRIPTION. The location of the GraphQL schema file.
<Source>

request
Each of these child elements is described in the sections that follow.
Child element reference
This section describes the child elements of <GraphQL> .
<Action>
Action represents one of the following GraphQL actions:
parse : Apigee parses the GraphQL payload into message flow variables.
See Examples of message flow
variable representations for an explanation of the variables that are set when
Action is set to parse . This can save valuable CPU time in the
backend.
Note that verify also parses the payload.
verify : Apigee verifies that the GraphQL payload conforms to the schema
uploaded to the proxy.
parse_verify : Apigee parses and verifies the GraphQL request.
Default value
parse
Required?
Optional
Type
String
Parent Element
<GraphQL>
Child Elements
none
The <Action> element uses the following syntax:
Syntax
<GraphQL
continueOnError="[false|true]"
enabled="[true|false]"
name="POLICY_NAME" >
<Action>parse</Action>
</GraphQL>
<MaxCount>
The maximum number of fragments that can be in the payload.
You can use this to prevent the GraphQL back-end server of the customer from executing highly
complex queries, forcing clients to break their logic in to smaller payloads.
Default value
10
Required?
Optional
Type
String
Parent Element
<GraphQL>
Child Elements
none
The <MaxCount> element uses the following syntax:
Syntax
<GraphQL
continueOnError="[false|true]"
enabled="[true|false]"
name="POLICY_NAME" >
<MaxCount>MAX_NUMBER_OF_QUERIES</MaxCount>
</GraphQL>
<MaxDepth>
The maximum depth of the query, when represented as a tree.
MaxDepth allows you to block deep queries in the payload,
so that Apigee does not need to create very large flow variables to hold the values.
However, the payload is sent as is, regardless of the value of MaxDepth .
The default value is 10.
Note: MaxDepth works when the Action element is
set to parse or parse-verify . It's a good practice to use
MaxDepth with these actions to check for depth instead of using the more
costly verify action.
Default value
10
Required?
Optional
Type
Integer
Parent Element

enabled="[true|false]"
name="POLICY_NAME" >
<MaxDepth>MAX_DEPTH</MaxDepth>
</GraphQL>
<MaxPayloadSizeInBytes>
The maximum size of a payload in kilobytes. You can use this to limit the payload
size, to avoid performance issues.
Note: If MaxPayloadSizeInByte is not provided in the policy,
no size restriction is enforced.
Default value
request

<OperationType>
Indicates the type of request that can be parsed:
query : A GraphQL query.

If the scope is query , and a mutation request is passed, the request fails
and returns a 4xx error.

GraphQL Parser
The graphQL parser supports all features of a graphQL query and
represents it as a graph in the message flow dotted notation. A query can comprise of operation
definition and optionally fragments identified as fragment definitions. See the
GraphQL specification .
Anatomy of a graphQL request
The diagram below shows the anatomy of a graphQL request.
Representation in message flow of operation definitions
The parser implementation covers all aspects of
graphQL syntax, including support for query and mutations. See
Message flow variable .
The message flow variables follows this convention:
graphql.(root-index).(root definition)[(sub-indices).(child-definitions)…]
where:
graphql : Static prefix indicating this is graphQL related message flow variables
root-Index : based index indicating the root level query definitions index (default up to 4
per request)
root-definition : Root level graphQL request message body, args, its values
sub-indices : Child indices
child-definitions : Leaf level definitions that correlate to specific fields and its values
Representation in message flow variable of operation definitions
Fields in message
Type
Description
name
String
Name of the graphQL operation. Note that this name is unrelated to the name in message flow.
definition
String - Operation
Indicates that this contains the main message body of the query request
operationType
query or mutation
The type of operation being performed.
variableDefinition
Integer
They work just like the argument definitions for a function in a typed language. It
lists all of the variables, prefixed by $, followed by their type.
directives
Integer
@include and @skip are the two directives currently offered, that can filter based
on dynamically passed values.
selectionSet
Integer
One level logical grouping of all attributes associated with an object.
Representation in message flow of fragment definitions
Message Flow Variable Name
Type
Description
name
String
Name of the fragment.
definition
String- fragment
Indicates that the body of the request is a fragment to the main request.
typeCondition
String
The condition under which the fragment gets invoked.
variableDefinition
Integer
The variables definition passed as arguments to the fragment.
Examples of message flow variable representations
The following examples show the message flow variable representations for
sample request payloads.
