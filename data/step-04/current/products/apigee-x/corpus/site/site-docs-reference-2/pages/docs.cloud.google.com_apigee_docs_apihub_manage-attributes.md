Manage attributes
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
Overview
You can think of an attribute as metadata for a resource. For example, in the case of an API
resource, the API can have an attribute called Target Users that specifies if the API
is intended for public, private, or internal consumption. There are many other such attributes
available.
Attributes are useful to you in the following ways:
You can filter your resource search results based on attributes. Therefore, having
more attributes will make it easy for you to narrow down your search results.
You can create custom attributes and associate them to API hub resources.
Attributes in API hub can be of two types:
System attributes: System attributes are predefined by API hub.
User attributes: User attributes, also referred to as Additional attributes , are defined by you based on your requirements.
API hub stores an attribute in the key-value format; where the key is the name of the attribute, and the
value is the corresponding value of the attribute. The value of an attribute can be of the following data types:
String
Enum
JSON
System attributes
System attributes are predefined by API hub for each resource type. These
attributes may be mandatory or optional for a resource. If an attribute is mandatory for a resource,
you must set the value of the attribute when you register the resource. For the list of supported system attributes, see Supported system attributes .
The values of Enum type system attributes can be immutable
or mutable.
Immutable: You can't make any changes to the
existing values. However, you can add new mutable values
to the attribute. For example, the Spec Type
attribute will have the values OpenAPI , Proto , and WSDL . You can't update these
values, but you can add new custom values.
Mutable: You can add, edit, or delete the existing
values. For example, the Lifecycle attribute
can initially have values like Dev , Stage ,
UAT , or Prod . You can edit these existing values, and add
new values.

View system attributes
Console
To view all the system attributes, in the Google Cloud console, go to the API hub > Settings page. You can
view all the existing system attributes in the System attributes tab.
REST API
To view all the system attributes of a resource issue a GET request
to the following API:
https://apihub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /attributes
For more information about the API, see ListAttributes .
The following example shows the API call to get the system
attributes for all the resources.
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-type: application/json" \
-X GET \
https://apihub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/test-project-1/locations/us-central1/attributes?filter=definition_type=SYSTEM_DEFINED
Edit a system attribute of type Enum
Caution: Avoid adding sensitive data to system attributes.
You can perform the following operations for a mutable value:
Add a new value
Update an existing value
Delete an existing attribute value
The examples in this section show how to update the allowed values of a system attribute of Enum type.
Note: You can't change the name of a system attribute.
Console
To add a value for a system attribute, do the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API hub > Settings page.
This displays all the existing system attributes in the System attributes section of the Attributes tab.
Click Edit for the attribute to which you want add a value.
This opens the attribute's edit pane, which displays the existing attribute values.
To add a new value, click Add item , and then enter the new value you want to add.
Note: To delete an existing value, click Delete for
the value that you want to delete. The Delete option is displayed only for the
values that are mutable. Therefore, if the delete option isn't displayed for a value,
you can infer that the value is immutable.
Click Save .
REST API
To update allowed values of a system defined attribute of Enum datatype, issue a PATCH request to the following API:
https://apihub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /attributes/ ATTRIBUTE
For more information about the API, see UpdateAttribute .
The following example shows the API call to update the values of the Business unit attribute.
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"allowed_values": [
{
"id": "bu1",
"display_name": "Business unit 1",
"description": "The API can be used by business unit 1"
},
{
"id": "bu2",
"display_name": "Business unit 2",
"description": "The API can be used by business unit 2"
},
{
"id": "bu3",
"display_name": "Business unit 3",
"description": "The API can be used by business unit 3"
}]}' \
-X PATCH https://apihub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/test-15/locations/us-central1/attributes/system-business-unit?update_mask=allowed_values
It's important to understand how API hub interprets the request payload
for the UpdateAttribute API.
If the value you specify in the payload is already present, API hub checks if the value has
been updated in the payload,
and then overwrites the value if it's updated.
If the value isn't available in the payload, API hub interprets that value should be deleted, and deletes the value from API hub.
If a new value is available in the payload, API hub adds the new value to the attribute.
Limitations
The following limitations apply to system attributes:
You can't update or change the API style attribute to MCP while existing API operations are present in the API resource.
To change the API style attribute to MCP , you must delete all the existing API operations associated with the API resource.
Specification files are not parsed or validated automatically for API versions with the MCP API style.
User defined attributes
