AccessControl policy
Stay organized with collections

Standard policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
The AccessControl policy lets you allow or deny access to your APIs by specific IP
addresses.
While you can attach this policy anywhere in the API proxy flow, you'll most likely want to
check IP addresses at the beginning of the flow ( Request / ProxyEndpoint / PreFlow), even before
authentication or quota checking.
Also consider using
Google Cloud Armor with Apigee as
an alternative way to secure your APIs.
This policy is a Standard policy and can be deployed to any environment type. For
information on policy types and availability with each environment type, see
Policy types .
Samples
The mask values in the following IPv4 samples identify which of the four octets (8, 16, 24, 32
bits) the match rule considers when allowing or denying access. The default value is 32. See the
mask attribute in the Element reference for more
information.
Deny 198.51.100.1
<AccessControl name="ACL">
<IPRules noRuleMatchAction = "ALLOW">
<MatchRule action = "DENY">
<SourceAddress mask="32">198.51.100.1</SourceAddress>
</MatchRule>
</IPRules>
</AccessControl>
Deny all requests from client address: 198.51.100.1
Allow requests from any other client address.
Deny using variables
<AccessControl name="ACL">
<IPRules noRuleMatchAction = "ALLOW">
<MatchRule action = "DENY">
<SourceAddress mask="{kvm.mask.value}">{kvm.ip.value}</SourceAddress>
</MatchRule>
</IPRules>
</AccessControl>
Suppose you're using a key value map (KVM) to store values for masking and IPs.
This is a handy approach to changing IPs and masking during runtime without having to update
and redeploy your API proxy. You can use the KeyValueMapOperations policy to retrieve
the variables containing the values for kvm.mask.value and
kvm.ip.value (assuming that's what you named the variables in your KVM policy
that contain the values of the mask and IP values from your KVM).
If the values you retrieved were 24 for the mask and 198.51.100.1
for the IP address, the AccessControl policy would deny all requests from: 198.51.100.*
All other client addresses would be allowed.

Usage notes
In addition to protecting your APIs against malicious IPs, the AccessControl policy also
gives you control over legitimate IP access. For example, if you only want computers under the
control of your enterprise to access the APIs exposed in your test environment, you can allow
the IP address range for your internal network. Developers working from home can
access these APIs using VPN.
Note: If you are using both
security actions and the
AccessControl policy to manage traffic based on IP address, the security action always executes
before the AccessControl policy. After that, neither impacts the other; the security action has
no influence on the AccessControl policy and vice versa.
The configuration and execution of an AccessControl policy involves the following:
Define a set of match rules with one of two actions (ALLOW or DENY) associated
with each.
For each match rule, specify the IP address (SourceAddress element).
See How the policy chooses which IP address to evaluate
to determine which IP address(es) in the message you're configuring rules to handle.
Configure a mask for each IP address. You allow or deny access based on a mask value on
the IP address. See About IP masking with CIDR notation .
Specify the order in which the rules are tested.
All the match rules are executed in the given order. When a rules matches, the
corresponding action is executed and following match rules are skipped.
If the same rule is configured with both ALLOW and DENY actions, the rule that is
defined first in the order is triggered and the subsequent rule (with the other action) is
skipped.
Handling of invalid IP addresses
The AccessControl policy handles invalid IP address strings passed as variables differently from invalid strings parsed through headers.
Header-Based (no <ClientIPVariable> ): When the policy directly parses the X-Forwarded-For
(XFF) header, any non-IP string (for example, pwned ) in the header being evaluated is silently
ignored. The policy proceeds as if the IP address string did not match any rule, and the action specified by
<noRuleMatchAction> is taken. This can be a security concern if <noRuleMatchAction> is set to
ALLOW , as it could be used to bypass blocklist rules.
Variable-Based ( <ClientIPVariable> is used): If a variable specified in <ClientIPVariable>
contains an invalid IP address format, the policy will throw an error (for example,
accesscontrol.InvalidIPAddressInVariable ). This provides a more explicit failure and is the
recommended approach for stricter IP validation.
How the policy chooses which IP address to evaluate
IP addresses can come from various sources in a request. For example, the
X-Forwarded-For header may contain one or more IP addresses. This section
describes how to configure the AccessControl policy to evaluate the exact IP address(es) you
want it to evaluate.
For Apigee hybrid, we recommend that you set up a load balancer in front of your Kubernetes cluster.
The load balancer may be L7 (HTTP aware) or L4 (TCP aware). L7 load balancers can add the
client source IP address to the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header. L4 load balancers should be
configured to use the PROXY protocol .
Consult your load balancer's manual on how to enable PROXY protocol support.
For enabling the PROXY protocol on the Ingress, see
Source IP address of the original client in the Istio documentation.
Following is the logic the AccessControl policy uses to decide which IP address to
evaluate:
X-Forwarded-For header
Apigee automatically populates the X-Forwarded-For header
with the IP address it received from the last external TCP handshake (such as the client IP or
router). If there are multiple IP addresses in the header, those addresses
are likely the chain of servers that processed a request. However, the list of addresses
could also contain a spoofed IP address. So how does the policy know which addresses to
evaluate?
Apigee specification for XFF header behavior
In Apigee, the presence of Google Cloud Load Balancers (GCLBs) affects the structure of the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header. The typical format of the header is as follows:
X-Forwarded-For: <client_ip>, <GCLB1_ip>, <internal_ingress_ip>
Note: The X-Forwarded-For header format depends on the network topology (path taken by the request across the network).
It is crucial to understand the implications of this structure when using the ValidateBasedOn element:
X_FORWARDED_FOR_LAST_IP : In Apigee, using this setting will evaluate the internal IP address of the second GCLB, not the original client IP. This can lead to unexpected policy behavior.
X_FORWARDED_FOR_FIRST_IP : While this setting correctly evaluates the original <client_ip> , you should be aware that <client_ip> can be easily spoofed by the client, making it less reliable for security-sensitive use cases.
X-Forwarded-For dimensions in Apigee analytics
Apigee Analytics writes the value of the X-Forwarded-For header to the
x_forwarded_for_ip dimension. To determine the client IP that made
the request to Apigee, use the values in the
ax_resolved_client_ip dimension but exclude ax_true_client_ip ,
which is not supported with the AccessControl policy. See
Analytics metrics, dimensions, and filters reference .
About IP masking with CIDR notation
CIDR notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a way of indicating a range of IP addresses
through masking. It applies to both IPv4 and IPv6. Here's how it works. We'll use IPv4 in our
examples for simplicity.
IP addresses are groups of numbers separated by periods. In binary terms, each group is a
specific number of bits (8 for IPv4 and 16 for IPv6). The IPv4 address 198.51.100.1 looks like
this in binary:
11000110.00110011.01100100.00000001
That's 4 groups of 8 bits, or 32 total bits. With CIDR, you can indicate a range by adding a
/number (1-32) to the IP address, like this:
198.51.100.1/24
In this case, the 24 is the number you would use for the mask attribute
value in this policy.
This notation means, "Keep the first 24 bits exactly as is, the remaining bits can be
any value 0 through 255." For example:
Keep these exactly as is
Possible values for the last group
198.51.100.
0 - 255
Notice that the mask happens at the end of group three. This makes things nice and tidy, in
essence creating a mask like this: 198.51.100.*. In most cases, using multiples of 8 (IPv4) and 16
(IPv6) will give you the masking level you want:
IPv4: 8, 16, 24, 32
IPv6: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128
However, you can use other numbers for finer-grained control, which involves a little binary
calculation. Here's an example using a mask of 30, as in 198.51.100.1/30 , where the last
1 is 00000001 in binary:
Keep these exactly as is
Possible values
11000110.00110011.01100100.000000 (first 30 bits)
000000 00 , 000000 01 , 000000 10 , or 000000 11
198.51.100.
0, 1, 2, or 3
In this example, with the configuration set to <SourceAddress
mask="30">198.51.100.1</SourceAddress> , the following IPs would be allowed (or
denied, depending on your rules):
198.51.100.0
198.51.100.1
198.51.100.2
198.51.100.3

<ClientIPVariable> element
Specifies a flow variable containing an IP address that the policy checks against the
IPRules. If the flow variable does not contain a valid IP address (ipv4 or ipv6),
then the policy throws an error.
Note: You can use the client.resolved.ip flow variable for the
client IP address. See
Client IP resolution
for information on how the client IP address is determined for that variable.
Suppose the flow variable is set to the 12.31.34.52 . In the following example,
access is denied. If the variable is set to 10.11.12.13 , access is granted.
<AccessControl name='ACL'>

< MatchRule action = "DENY" >
< SourceAddress mask = "24" > { variable } < / SourceAddress >

< / IPRules >
As shown in the previous example, the SourceAddress element also supports
Message templates for the
mask attribute or IP address, which
means you can set the values using variables that are currently available in the
API proxy flow.
For example, you can store an IP address in a key value map (KVM) and use the
KeyValueMapOperations policy to retrieve the IP address and assign it to a variable (such as
kvm.ip.value ). You can then use that variable for the IP address:
<SourceAddress mask="24"> {kvm.ip.value} </SourceAddress>
Setting mask and/or IP address with a variable gives you the flexibility to change values at
runtime without having to modify and re-deploy your API proxy.

mask
The mask attribute is a way to indicate the range of IP addresses to
allow or deny. Mask is the equivalent of using
CIDR notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). For example:
<SourceAddress mask="24">198.51.100.1</SourceAddress>
is equivalent to the following CIDR notation:
198.51.100.1/24
Valid values:
IPv4: 1-32
IPv6: 1-128
A value of zero (0) is valid only for IP 0.0.0.0, hence impractical.
Set the mask with a variable
The mask attribute also supports
Message templates , which
means you can set the value with a variable that's currently available in the
API proxy flow. For example, you can store a mask value in a KVM and use the
KeyValueMapOperations policy to retrieve the mask and assign it to a variable.
To set the IP mask with the variable, use the following format,
assuming the variable is named kvm.mask.value :
mask="{kvm.mask.value}"

N/A
Required
<ValidateBasedOn> element
When the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header contains multiple IP
addresses, use this ValidateBasedOn element to control which IP addresses are
evaluated.
Note: Currently it is necessary to set the
element <IgnoreTrueClientIPHeader> to true in order for multiple IP addresses to be
evaluated.
Use this approach to evaluating a IP addresses only if you're certain about the validity
of the IP addresses you want to evaluate. For example, if you choose to evaluate all
IP addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header, you have to be able to trust the
validity of those addresses, and/or set up comprehensive DENY or ALLOW rules to let only trusted
IPs call your API proxy.
Note: You can use the client.resolved.ip flow variable for the
client IP address in <clientIPVariable> rather than using <ValidateBasedOn> . See
<ClientIPVariable> element .
The leftmost IP address in the header belongs to the client, and the rightmost is the server
which forwarded the request to the current service. The rightmost, or last IP address,
is the address Apigee received from the last external TCP handshake.
The value you enter in this element lets you determine whether to check all IP addresses in
the header (default), only the first IP address, or only the last IP address.

Error reference
This section describes the fault codes and error messages that are returned and fault variables that are set by Apigee when this policy triggers an error.
This information is important to know if you are developing fault rules to
handle faults. To learn more, see What you need to know
about policy errors and Handling
faults .
Runtime errors
These errors can occur when the policy executes.
Use API Monitoring to investigate fault
codes and diagnose issues faster. See Set up a policy fault code alert
for an example. See Fault code reference for a complete
list of all fault codes that you can handle with API Monitoring.

Example
fault.name=" fault_name "
fault_name is the name of the fault, as listed in the Runtime errors table above. The fault name is the last part of the fault code.
