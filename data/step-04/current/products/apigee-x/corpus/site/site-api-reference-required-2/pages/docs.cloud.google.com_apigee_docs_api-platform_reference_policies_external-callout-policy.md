ExternalCallout policy
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Standard policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
The ExternalCallout policy enables you to send
gRPC requests to your gRPC server
to implement custom behavior that isn't supported by Apigee policies. In your server's code,
you can easily access and modify flow variables within a proxy's flow.
Apigee communicates with a gRPC server through an ExternalCallout policy via an API.
proto file.-->
Apigee uses the API to send
flow variables
to the gRPC server.
Within your gRPC server, you can read—and depending on the variable, modify—
the flow variables listed in the
Flow variables reference
page, as well as additional variables you specify within the policy's XML.
If you configure the gRPC server with Apigee and include this policy in a proxy, Apigee
will handle API requests as follows:
Apigee sends a message containing the flow variables to your gRPC server.
Your gRPC server code executes, accessing and modifying variables as defined in
the code. The gRPC server
then sends a response containing all the flow variables back to Apigee.
Apigee reads the response from your gRPC server. If any variables are added or
modifiable flow variables are modified, they are updated in Apigee.
This policy is a Standard policy and can be deployed to any environment type. For
information on policy types and availability with each environment type, see
Policy types .

The following table describes the child elements of
<ExternalCallout> .
Child Element
Required
Description
<TimeoutMs>
Required
The request timeout in milliseconds for gRPC requests.
<GrpcConnection>
Required
Specifies the name of an existing TargetServer to be the gRPC server to
send requests to.
<Configurations>
Optional
Allows you to configure various aspects of the ExternalCallout policy,
including the <Property> and <FlowVariable>
elements.
Example 1
Working examples of ExternalCallout are available at External Callout Samples on GitHub.
The following example illustrates an ExternalCallout policy configuration.
< ExternalCallout enabled = "true" continueOnError = "false" name = "ExternalCallout-1" >
< DisplayName>External Callout 1 < / DisplayName >
< TimeoutMs>5000 < / TimeoutMs >

< Property name = "with.request.headers" > false < / Property >
< Property name = "with.response.content" > true < / Property >
< Property name = "with.response.headers" > false < / Property >
< FlowVariable>example1 . flow . variable < / FlowVariable >
< FlowVariable>example2 . flow . variable < / FlowVariable >
< / Configurations >
< ExternalCallout >
The example sends a request to an external gRPC server represented by the
TargetServer named external-target-server , with the following configurations:
<Property> : Include request and response content, but not
the request and response headers, in the
request sent to the gRPC server.
<FlowVariable> : Include additional
flow variables
example1.flow.variable and example2.flow.variable ,
specified by the FlowVariable elements, in the request sent to the gRPC
server.
Example 2
In the following example, the useTargetUrl attribute of the Audience
element is set to true . When useTargetUrl is true ,
the hostname of the gRPC target server is used as the audience. For
example, if the host of the server is my-grpc-server-java.a.run.app , then the audience
used will be https://my-grpc-server-java.a.run.app .
Apigee hybrid users:
If you use Apigee hybrid, note that the useTargetUrl attribute is available in
Apigee hybrid version 1.8 and later versions.

Child element reference
The following sections describe the child elements of ExternalCallout .
<TimeoutMs>
The request timeout in milliseconds for gRPC requests. <TimeoutMs> must be
a positive number.
<GrpcConnection>
The <GrpcConnection> element sets the gRPC server to be an existing
TargetServer , specified by the name attribute. See the
TargetServer resource reference page.
Note: The
protocol for the TargetServer must be GRPC .
For example, the following code
<GrpcConnection>
<Server name="external-target-server"/>
</GrpcConnection>
specifies the gRPC server to be an existing TargetServer named
external-target-server .
Use the <Authentication> element (described later in this section) to generate a Google-issued
OpenID Connect token
to make authenticated calls to gRPC-based services, such as custom services hosted in
Cloud Run .
The following table describes the child elements of
<GrpcConnection> .

<HeaderName> child element
By default, when an Authentication configuration is present, Apigee generates a bearer
token and injects it into the Authorization header in the message sent to the target system.
The HeaderName element allows you to specify the name of a different header
to hold that bearer token. This feature is particularly useful when the target is a Cloud Run
service that uses the X-Serverless-Authorization header. The Authorization header,
if present, is left unmodified and also sent in the request.
Default
N/A
Required?
No
Type

<Authentication>
<HeaderName ref="FLOW_VARIABLE">STRING</HeaderName>
<GoogleIDToken>
...
</GoogleIDToken>
</Authentication>
...
</ExternalCallout>
With static string
In this example, the generated bearer token is added, by default, to a header named X-Serverless-Authorization
that is sent to the target system. The Authorization header,
if present, is left unmodified and also sent in the request.
<Authentication>
<HeaderName>X-Serverless-Authorization</HeaderName>
<GoogleIDToken>
<Audience>https://cloudrun-hostname.a.run.app</Audience>
</GoogleIDToken>
</Authentication>
With variable reference
In this example, the generated bearer token is added, by default, to a header named X-Serverless-Authorization
that is sent to the target system. If my-variable has a value, that value is used
instead of the default string. The Authorization header,
if present, is left unmodified and also sent in the request.

<IncludeEmail>true</IncludeEmail>
</GoogleIDToken>
</Authentication>
<Audience> child element
The audience for the generated authentication token, such as the API or account that the
token grants access to.
If the value of Audience is empty, the ref is empty or resolves to an
empty value, and useTargetUrl is true , then "https://" +
(hostname of the gRPC target server) is used as the audience.
For example, if the host of the server is my-grpc-server-java.a.run.app , then the
audience used will be https://my-grpc-server-java.a.run.app .
By default, useTargetUrl is false .
Apigee hybrid users:
If you use Apigee hybrid, note that the useTargetUrl attribute is available in
Apigee hybrid version 1.8 and later versions.

<Property>
The <Property> element specifies whether request/response
headers and/or content will be sent to the server. Possible values are true
(the item will be sent) or false (the item won't be sent). The default value
is false .
The following table describes the attributes of the <Property>
element.

with.response.headers
N/A
Required
String
<FlowVariable>
The <FlowVariable> element specifies what additional flow variables
will be sent to the server. The value of
<FlowVariable> is a prefix of a variable, rather than the full variable name.
For example , if the element is a.b.c , the
value of a variable named a.b.c will be sent to the server. Similarly, the value
of a variable
named a.b.c.my-variable will be sent to the server. But the value of a variable
named a.x.another-variable will not be sent, because it does not have the
prefix a.b.c . Here are some examples
<Configurations>
<FlowVariable>a.b.c</FlowVariable>
<FlowVariable>d.e.f</FlowVariable>
</Configurations>
Error Reference
Deployment errors
Error name
Cause
FAILED_PRECONDITION
This error happens if the service account is missing when the proxy is
configured with the <Authentication> tag.
For example:
Deployment of \"organizations/foo/apis/apiproxy/revisions/1\"
requires a service account identity, but one was not provided
with the request.
PERMISSION_DENIED
This error happens if there is a permission problem with the service account if
the proxy is
configured with the <Authentication> tag. Possible causes:
The service account does not exist.
The service account was not created in the same Google Cloud project as the Apigee organization.
The deployer does have iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on the
service account. For details, see About service account permissions .
Runtime errors
The table below describes runtime errors, which can occur when the policy executes.
Fault code
HTTP Status
Cause
GrpcTlsInitFailed
500
This error will occur if there are any issues with initializing TLS with the gRPC
server (such as Keystore or truststore issues).
steps.externalcallout.[error_code]
500
[error_code] is determined by the Fault
message's errorCode field.
The fault string of the error will be the fault message's
faultstring field.
steps.externalcallout.ExecutionError
500
This error will occur if any other exception occurs during the execution of this
policy. The underlying exception will be exposed in the faultstring.
If there was an issue with the credentials to the gRPC server, the error will look
something like this:
{
"fault": {
"faultstring": "Encountered the following exception while sending the gRPC request or
processing the response: [io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE: Credentials failed
to obtain metadata].",
"detail": {
"errorcode": "steps.externalcallout.ExecutionError"
}
}
}
You can look at the logs of the MP for further debugging pointers.
googletoken.EmptyIDTokenAudience
500
<GoogleIDToken> is enabled but useTargetUrl is set to false
and no value is provided to
<Audience> either directly
or through reference at the time of error.
steps.externalcallout.ExecutionError
with fault string:
Encountered the following exception while sending the gRPC request or
processing the response: [io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE: Credentials
failed to obtain metadata]
500
This error happens if the API proxy is configured with the <Authentication> element.
Possible causes:
The service account deployed with the proxy:
does not exist in your project (it existed when deployed, but was deleted after deployment)
has been disabled
(Apigee hybrid only) has not granted the roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on the
apigee-runtime service account.
(Apigee hybrid only) The IAMCredentials API is disabled in the source project of the
apigee-runtime service account.
Note: For Apigee hybrid only, check the runtime container's log and search for
externalcallout.ExecutionError to find more detailed error messages
that may help with debugging the problem.
steps.externalcallout.ExecutionError with faultstring containing
PERMISSION DENIED .
For example, the faultstring will look like the following for Cloud Run:
Encountered the following exception while sending the gRPC
request or processing the response: [io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException:
PERMISSION_DENIED: HTTP status code 403 …]
500
This error happens if the API proxy is configured with the <Authentication>
element. Possible causes:
The proxy service account exists and is enabled but does not have the right
permissions to access the service.
The service requires authentication but the request did not have an authentication
header (For example: the authentication XML was not included in the policy XML).
Miscellaneous errors
The table below describes miscellaneous errors. See the cause for more details.
Fault code
Cause
ReferencesExistToGrpcServer
This error will occur if a user tries to delete a gRPC target server, but the server
is still being used by other policies.
Faults
The fault variables in the following table are set for all policies by default. See
Variables specific to policy errors .
Variables
Where
Examples
fault.name="fault_name"
fault_name is the name of the fault, as listed in the Runtime errors
table above. The fault name is the last part of the fault code.
fault.name matches "ExecutionError".
externalcallout.[policy_name].failed
policy_name is the user-specified name of the policy that threw the fault.
externalcallout.ExternalCallout-1.failed = true
