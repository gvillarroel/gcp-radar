FlowCallout policy

Extensible policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
Use the FlowCallout policy to call out to a shared flow from either an API proxy or another
shared flow.
In a shared flow, you create a sequence of steps that you can reuse at run time from multiple
places. These steps are implemented as policies, as within an API proxy. The FlowCallout policy
gives you a way to invoke the shared flow from API proxies and other shared flows.
It works like a function call in a traditional programming language.
For example, imagine that you've built a shared flow with security features such as
API key verification, OAuth token validation, and regular expression protection. This shared flow
represents your convention for a way to check inbound requests.
Using the FlowCallout policies, you can invoke that shared flow from multiple API proxies.
You can call one shared flow from another by implementing a FlowCallout policy
from within a shared flow.
This policy is an Extensible policy and use of this policy might have cost or
utilization implications, depending on your Apigee license. For information on policy types
and usage implications, see
Policy types .
Note: For more on shared flows, see
Reusable shared flows . You can also call a
shared flow from outside API proxy code to enforce request pre-processing or response post-processing
for all API Proxies deployed in an environment. For more, see
Attaching a shared flow using
a flow hook .
Samples
Verify API key in shared flow
In this example a shared flow is used to perform common security-related tasks. Here the
shared flow validates an API key. API proxies and other shared flows can use the
FlowCallout policy to make calls into this shared flow.
The following shared flow definition includes a Verify-API-Key policy that executes
when the shared flow is called from a FlowCallout policy in an API proxy.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<SharedFlow name="default">
<Step>
<Name>Verify-API-Key</Name>
</Step>
</SharedFlow>
The VerifyAPIKey policy within the preceding shared flow retrieves the key
value and verifies it.
<VerifyAPIKey async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Verify-API-Key">
<DisplayName>Verify API Key</DisplayName>
<APIKey ref="request.queryparam.apikey"/>
</VerifyAPIKey>
The following FlowCallout policy, used in an API proxy, calls the preceding
shared flow to verify the API key. The verify-apikey-shared shared flow bundle
(not shown here) configures the shared flow in the way an APIProxy bundle configures a proxy.
<FlowCallout async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Auth-Flow-Callout">
<DisplayName>Auth Flow Callout</DisplayName>
<SharedFlowBundle>verify-apikey-shared</SharedFlowBundle>
</FlowCallout>
Pass parameters to a shared flow
This example illustrates how to pass parameters from a FlowCallout policy to a
shared flow. Here, a FlowCallout policy calls to a shared flow designed to perform common
string handling functions. The shared flow includes JavaScript that concatenates its input,
lower-cases its input, or both. The FlowCallout policy defines parameters that specify
the string input, output, and what to do with the input.
The String-Handler FlowCallout policy calls the shared flow,
passing parameters specifying the variable to store the shared flow's output, what shared flow
operation to use, and what input to use (here, a string literal, but it could also be a
flow variable). The Parameter elements specify the names and values of variables
to create runtime. The shared flow can retrieve these variables for use in its own code.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<FlowCallout async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="String-Handler">
<DisplayName>String Handler</DisplayName>
<Parameters>
<Parameter name="input">Gladys Kravitz</Parameter>
<Parameter name="operations">concatenate tolowercase</Parameter>
<Parameter name="outputVariable">string.handler.output</Parameter>
</Parameters>
<SharedFlowBundle>StringHandler</SharedFlowBundle>
</FlowCallout>
The following default shared flow includes a
SharedStringFunctions JavaScript policy that executes when the shared flow
is called from a FlowCallout policy.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<SharedFlow name="default">
<Step>
<Name>SharedStringFunctions</Name>
</Step>
</SharedFlow>
In the shared flow, the following SharedStringFunctions JavaScript policy
specifies the SharedStringFunctions.js JavaScript file with the code to execute.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<Javascript async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" timeLimit="200" name="SharedStringFunctions">
<DisplayName>SharedStringFunctions</DisplayName> <Properties/>
<ResourceURL>jsc://SharedStringFunctions.js</ResourceURL>
</Javascript>
The following JavaScript, SharedStringFunctions.js , executes from the
SharedStringFunctions JavaScript policy. This script retrieves values from
variables created from FlowCallout policy Parameter elements.
// Input value from the calling API proxy .
var handledString = context . getVariable ( "input" );
// Variable to use for output from this script .
var outputVariable = context . getVariable ( "outputVariable" );
// A space - separated list of things to do to the input string .
// Convert to lower case to handle unintentional capitals in configuration .
var operation = context . getVariable ( "operations" ) . toLowerCase ();
// If "lowercase" was given as an operation , convert the input to lowercase .
if ( operation . includes ( "tolowercase" )) {
handledString = handledString . toLowerCase ();
}
// If "concatenate" was given as an operation , concatenate the input .
if ( operation . includes ( "concatenate" )) {
handledString = handledString . replace ( / \ s +/ g , '' );
}
// Assign the resulting string to the output variable specified by
// the calling API proxy .
context . setVariable ( outputVariable , handledString );
Execution flows back from the JavaScript policy, to the shared flow, then to the
FlowCallout policy in the originating API proxy.
Element reference
Following are elements and attributes you can configure on this policy:
<FlowCallout async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Flow-Callout-1">
<DisplayName>Custom label used in UI</DisplayName>
<SharedFlowBundle>thereferencedsharedflowbundle</SharedFlowBundle>
</FlowCallout>
<FlowCallout> attributes
<FlowCallout async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="Flow-Callout-1">
The following table describes attributes that are common to all policy parent elements:
Attribute
Description
Default
Presence
name
The internal name of the policy. The value of the name attribute can
contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, underscores, and periods. This value cannot
exceed 255 characters.
Optionally, use the <DisplayName> element to label the policy in
the management UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language name.
N/A
Required
continueOnError
Set to false to return an error when a policy fails. This is expected
behavior for most policies.
Set to true to have flow execution continue even after a policy
fails. See also:
Fault rules are triggered ONLY in an error state (about continueOnError)
Handling faults within the current flow
false
Optional
enabled
Set to true to enforce the policy.
Set to false to turn off the policy. The policy will not be
enforced even if it remains attached to a flow.
true
Optional
async
This attribute is deprecated.
false
Deprecated
<DisplayName> element
Use in addition to the name attribute to label the policy in the
management UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language name.
<DisplayName>Policy Display Name</DisplayName>
Default
N/A
If you omit this element, the value of the policy's name attribute is
used.
Presence
Optional
Type
String
<SharedFlowBundle> element
Specifies the name of the shared flow to call. This element's value should be the same as the
value of the target <SharedFlowBundle> element's name attribute.
<SharedFlowBundle/>
In the simplest example, you give the name of the shared flow being called as a value for this
element. That is, this element's value must be the same as the shared flow's name
attribute value.
<SharedFlowBundle>Shared-Flow-Name</SharedFlowBundle>
Default
N/A
Presence
Required
Type
N/A
Attributes
None.
<Parameter> element
Specifies a parameter and value (or value source) to pass as a variable into the shared flow called by this
policy.
By using a parameter, you can specify a value (or a variable containing a value) that should be
passed to the shared flow called by the policy. This is conceptually similar to specifying a
parameter in a function call. As with a function parameter, a FlowCallout parameter's value can
vary based on the context of the shared flow call.
FlowCallout parameters are visible only during the shared flow's execution.
Syntax
You can use this element with any one of the following syntax forms. Note that where you
use a literal value, the format of the value you specify will depend on the code that
consumes it.
< !-- A literal value in an attribute . -- >
< Parameter name = "parameter-name" value = 'parameter-value' / >
< !-- A reference to a variable in an attribute . -- >
< Parameter name = "parameter-name" ref = 'source-variable-name' / >
< !-- A literal value in the element content . -- >
< Parameter name = "parameter-name" > parameter - value < / Parameter >
< !-- A reference to an attribute in the element content . -- >
< Parameter name = "parameter-name" > { source - variable - name } < / Parameter >
Example
This String-Handler FlowCallout policy passing parameters that specify where
to store the shared flow's output and what input to use. The Parameter elements
specify the names and values of variables to create runtime. The shared flow can retrieve
these variables for use in its own code.
