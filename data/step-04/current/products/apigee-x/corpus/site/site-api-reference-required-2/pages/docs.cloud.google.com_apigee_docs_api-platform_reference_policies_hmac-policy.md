Standard policy
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
The HMAC policy computes and optionally verifies a Hash-based Message Authentication Code
(HMAC). Sometimes known as Keyed Message Authentication Code or Keyed hash, HMAC uses a
cryptographic hash function like SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 or MD-5,
applied to a "message," along with a secret key, to produce a signature or message
authentication code on that message. The term "message" here refers to any stream of
bytes. In the typical use of HMAC, a sender of a message sends a message and its HMAC to
a receiver, and the receiver can use the HMAC along with the shared secret key to
authenticate the message.
This policy is a Standard policy and can be deployed to any environment type. For
information on policy types and availability with each environment type, see
Policy types .
To learn more about HMAC,
see HMAC: Keyed-Hashing
for Message Authentication (rfc2104) .

Computation of a signature and verification of that signature follow exactly the same
process. The HMAC policy computes an HMAC, and can optionally verify the computed
signature against an expected value. The optional VerificationValue element
(if present) directs the policy to check the computed value against a known or given
value.
Element reference for HMAC
The policy reference describes the elements and attributes of the HMAC policy.
Attributes that
apply to the top-level element
<HMAC name="HMAC" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" async="false">
The following attributes are common to all policy parent elements.
Attribute
Description
Default
Presence
name
The internal name of the policy. Characters you can use in the name are restricted to:
A-Z0-9._\-$ % . However, the Apigee UI enforces additional
restrictions, such as automatically removing characters that are not alphanumeric.
Optionally, use the <DisplayName> element to
label the policy in the Apigee UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language
name.
N/A
Required
continueOnError
Set to false to return an error when a policy fails. This is expected
behavior for most policies.
Set to true to have flow execution continue even after a policy
fails. See also:
Fault rules are triggered ONLY in an error state (about continueOnError)
Handling faults within the current flow
false
Optional
enabled
Set to true to enforce the policy.
Set to false to "turn off" the policy. The policy will not be enforced
even if it remains attached to a flow.
true
Optional
async
This attribute is deprecated.
false
Deprecated
<Algorithm>
<Algorithm>algorithm-name</Algorithm>
Specifies the hash algorithm to use when computing the HMAC.
Default
N/A
Presence
Required
Type
String
Valid values
SHA-1 , SHA-224 , SHA-256 , SHA-384 ,
SHA-512 , and MD-5
The policy configuration accepts algorithm names without distinguishing case, and
with or without the dash between the letters and numbers. For example,
SHA256 and SHA-256 and sha256
are equivalent.
Security note: SHA-1 and MD-5 are included here for
completeness, but Google recommends that people do not use these hashes. Google
first demonstrated collision attacks against SHA-1 in 2017 ,
and recommends against
using it; NIST also recommends that people stop using SHA-1 . The CMU Software
Engineering Institute first recommended that people should avoid using the MD5
algorithm in any capacity, in 2008.
<DisplayName>
<DisplayName>Policy Display Name</DisplayName>
Use in addition to the name attribute to label the policy in the Apigee UI proxy editor
with a different, natural-language name.
Default
If you omit this element, the value of the policy's name attribute is used.
Presence
Optional
Type
String
<Message>
< Message>message_template_here < / Message >
or
< Message ref = 'variable_here' / >
Specifies the message payload to sign. This element's input supports
message templates
(variable substitution) to allow additional items to be included at runtime, such as timestamps, nonces, lists of
headers, or other information. For example:
< Message>Fixed Part
{ a_variable }
{ timeFormatUTCMs ( timeFormatString1 , system . timestamp )}
{ nonce }
< / Message >
The message template can include fixed and variable parts, including newlines and static functions.
Whitespace, such as newlines and space characters, is significant.
Default
N/A
Presence
Required
Type
String
Valid values
Any string is valid for the text value. If you provide a ref attribute,
it will take precedence over the text value. The policy evaluates either the text
value or the referenced variable as a message template.
<Output>
< Output encoding = 'encoding_name' > variable_name < / Output >
Specifies the name of the variable that the policy should set with the computed HMAC value.
Also specifies the encoding to use for the output.
Default
The default output variable is hmac.POLICYNAME.output .
The default value for the encoding attribute is base64 .
Presence
Optional. If this element is not present, the policy sets the flow variable
hmac.POLICYNAME.output , with a base64-encoded value.
Type
String
Valid values
For encoding, hex ,
base16 , base64 , base64url .
The values are case insensitive; hex and base16 are synonyms.
The text value of the Output element
can be any valid flow variable name.
<SecretKey>
<SecretKey encoding='encoding_name' ref='private.secretkey'/>
Specifies the secret key used to compute the HMAC. The key is obtained from the referenced
variable, decoded according to the specific encoding.
Default
There is no default value for the referenced variable;
the ref attribute is required.
In the absence of an encoding attribute, by default the policy
decodes the secret key string with UTF-8 to obtain the key bytes.
Presence
Required
Type
String
Valid values
For encoding , valid values are hex , base16 , base64 ,
utf8 . The default is UTF8. The values are case-insensitive, and dashes are
insignificant. Base16 is the same as base-16 and
bAse16 . Base16 and Hex are synonyms.
Using an encoding attribute allows you to specify a key that
includes bytes outside the range of UTF-8 printable characters.
For example, suppose the policy configuration includes this:
<SecretKey encoding='hex' ref='private.encodedsecretkey'/>
And suppose private.encodedsecretkey holds the string 536563726574313233 .
In this case, the key bytes will be decoded as: [53 65 63 72 65 74 31 32 33]
(each byte represented in hex). As another example, if using encoding='base64' ,
and if private.encodedsecretkey holds the string U2VjcmV0MTIz ,
it will result in the same set of bytes for the key. With no encoding attribute, or
with an encoding attribute of UTF8 , the string value Secret123
would result in the same set of bytes. This shows three different ways to represent the
same key.
<VerificationValue>
< VerificationValue encoding = 'encoding_name' ref = 'variable_name' / >
or
< VerificationValue encoding = 'encoding_name' > string_value < / VerificationValue >
(Optional) Specifies the verification value, as well as the encoding that was
used to encode the verification value. The policy will use this encoding to decode the value.
Default
There is no default verification value. If the element is present but the
encoding attribute is absent, the policy uses a default encoding of base64
Presence
Optional
Type
String
Valid values
Valid values for the encoding attribute are: hex , base16 ,
base64 , base64url . The values
are case insensitive; hex and base16 are synonyms.
The encoding of the VerificationValue need not be the same as the encoding
used for the Output element.
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true|false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
Set to false if you want the policy to throw an error when any referenced variable specified
in the policy is unresolvable. Set to true to treat any unresolvable variable as an empty string
(null).
The IgnoreUnresolvedVariables boolean affects only variables that are referenced by the
message template. While SecretKey and VerificationValue can reference a variable, both
of those need to be resolvable, so the ignore setting does not apply to those.
Default
False
Presence
Optional
Type
Boolean
Valid values
true or false
Flow variables
The policy can set these variables during execution.
Variable
Description
Example
hmac. policy_name .message
The policy sets this variable with the effective message,
the result of evaluating the message template specified in the Message
element.
hmac.HMAC-Policy.message = "Hello, World"
hmac. policy_name .output
Gets the result of
the HMAC computation, when the Output element does
not specify a variable name.
hmac.HMAC-Policy.output = /yyRjydfP+fBHTwXFgc5AZhLAg2kwCri+e35girrGw4=
hmac. policy_name .outputencoding
Gets the name of the output encoding.
hmac.HMAC-Policy.outputencoding = base64
Common Issues
At one level, the HMAC policy seems to be straightforward: provide a key and a message, and get
a computed HMAC in response. It can be frustrating when using the policy if you obtain an unexpected
HMAC value for a known message and key combination. This section will explain some usage notes
to work through such problems.
There are two common pitfalls that result in mismatched HMACs during verification:
whitespace differences in the message, and differences in encoding and decoding.
The latter applies to both the SecretKey element as well as
the Output element .
Whitespace Differences
Differences that may seem unimportant to a human, affect the output HMAC value. For example,
suppose a secret key that can be represented as "Secret123". With UTF-8 decoding, the key bytes
will be: [53 65 63 72 65 74 31 32 33] . Using that key to compute an
HMAC-SHA256 on the message abc results in a7938720fe5749d31076e6961360364c0cd271443f1b580779932c244293bc94 .
Adding a single space to the message, so that it is abc<SPACE> , where
<SPACE> implies an ASCII 32, results in an
HMAC-SHA256 of 274669b2a85d2532da48e2ce3d8e52ee17346d1bcd1a606d87db1934b5ab294b .
Similarly, if the message is abc<NEWLINE> , where
<NEWLINE> implies an ASCII 10,
the HMAC is 0780370844ca07f896066837e8230d3b6a775f678a4ae03e6b5e864c674831f5 .
Slight changes in the message result in very different HMAC values. This is by design.
This is an intended and desired behavior of HMAC.
The takeaway: It's important to ensure that the message body used to calculate the
original HMAC and the message body used to verify the HMAC are exactly the same. If
the verifier of an HMAC changes the message payload in any way, by adding any
whitespace or reformatting the text, the calculated HMAC will change.
Take special care when using a message template in the policy configuration. For example,
this policy configuration fragment shows a potential problem:
<HMAC name='HMAC-1'>
...
<!-- the result of this message template will include surrounding whitespace -->
<Message>
{request.content}
</Message>
...
</HMAC>
The result of evaluating the message template within the <Message>
element will include newlines and spaces surrounding the message content. This is
probably not what is intended. A better configuration would look like this:
<HMAC name='HMAC-1'>
...
<Message>{request.content}</Message>
...
</HMAC>
Differences in Encoding
Different decodings of the same key material, results in different keys. Suppose a secret key
that can be represented as "U2VjcmV0S2V5MTIz". With UTF-8 decoding, the key bytes
as representated in base16 will be: [55 32 56 6a 63 6d 56 30 53 32 56 35 4d 54 49 7a] .
With base64-decoding, the key bytes will be [53 65 63 72 65 74 4b 65 79 31 32 33] .
Decoding the source material differently results in different keys, and that will result in
different HMAC values.
The takeaway: It's important to ensure that the key material used to calculate the
original HMAC and the key used to verify the HMAC are exactly the same. This probably means
ensuring that the same encoding of the key is used on both ends. In the HMAC policy,
you can use the encoding attribute on the SecretKey element
to specify the key encoding.
Also consider encodings on the output. An HMAC-SHA256 expressed in base16 or hex encoding
as 27f17e11c8ece93844c5eb5e55161d993368628a214f9a51c25d0185e8ea06e2 is the
same as an HMAC-SHA256 expressed in base64 encoded form as J/F+Ecjs6ThExeteVRYdmTNoYoohT5pRwl0BhejqBuI= .
They look different, but these two strings represent the same value. Ensure that the same
encoding is used to encode the originally calculated HMAC, and the verifying HMAC. In the HMAC policy,
you can use the encoding attribute on the Output element
to specify your desired output encoding, and the same attribute on the
VerificationValue element
to specify how to decode the verifier.
Error reference
This section describes the fault codes and error messages that are returned and fault variables that are set by Apigee when this policy triggers an error.
This information is important to know if you are developing fault rules to
handle faults. To learn more, see What you need to know
about policy errors and Handling
faults .
Runtime errors
These errors can occur when the policy executes.
Use API Monitoring to investigate fault
codes and diagnose issues faster. See Set up a policy fault code alert
for an example. See Fault code reference for a complete
list of all fault codes that you can handle with API Monitoring.
-->
Fault code
HTTP status
Occurs when
steps.hmac.UnresolvedVariable
401
This error occurs if a variable specified in the HMAC policy is either:
Out of scope (not available in the specific flow where the policy is being executed)
or
Can't be resolved (is not defined)
steps.hmac.HmacVerificationFailed
401
The HMAC verification failed; the verification value provided does not
match the calculated value.
steps.hmac.HmacCalculationFailed
401
The policy was unable to calculate the HMAC.
steps.hmac.EmptySecretKey
401
The value of the secret key variable is empty.
steps.hmac.EmptyVerificationValue
401
The variable holding the verification value is emtpy.
Deployment errors
These errors can occur when you deploy a proxy containing this policy.
Error name
HTTP status
Occurs when
steps.hmac.MissingConfigurationElement
401
This error occurs when a required element or attribute is missing.
steps.hmac.InvalidValueForElement
401
This error occurs if the value specified in the Algorithm element is not
one of the following values: SHA-1 , SHA-224 , SHA-256 ,
SHA-512 , or MD-5 .
steps.hmac.InvalidSecretInConfig
401
This error occurs if there is a text value explicitly provided for SecretKey .
steps.hmac.InvalidVariableName
401
This error occurs if the SecretKey variable does not contain the
private prefix ( private. ).
Fault variables
These variables are set when a runtime error occurs. For more information,
see What you need to know
about policy errors .
Variables
Where
Example
fault.name=" fault_name "
fault_name is the name of the fault, as listed in the
Runtime errors table above. The fault name is the last
part of the fault code.
fault.name Matches "UnresolvedVariable"
hmac. policy_name .failed
The policy sets this variable in the case of a failure.
hmac.HMAC-Policy.failed = true
Example error response
For error handling, the best practice is to trap the errorcode part of the error
response. Do not rely on the text in the faultstring , because it could change.
Example fault rule
<FaultRules>
<FaultRule name="HMAC Policy Errors">
<Step>
<Name>AM-Unauthorized</Name>
<Condition>(fault.name Matches "HmacVerificationFailed")</Condition>
</Step>
<Condition>hmac.HMAC-1.failed = true</Condition>
</FaultRule>
</FaultRules>
