View
Apigee Edge documentation.
As a developer working with Apigee, your primary development activities involve
configuring API proxies that function as proxies for APIs or backend services. This document is a
reference of all configuration elements available to you when building API proxies.
If you are learning how to build API proxies, it is recommended that you begin with the topic
Building a simple API
proxy .
Edit your API proxy configuration using one of the following methods:
Use the Apigee UI or
API .
Download the API proxy configuration bundle, edit it manually, and upload the new configuration to Apigee, as described in
Downloading and uploading an API proxy configuration bundle .
API proxy configuration directory structure
The API proxy configuration directory structure is shown below:
An API proxy configuration consists of the following contents:
Base configuration
Primary configuration settings for an API proxy.
ProxyEndpoint
Settings for the inbound HTTP connection (from requesting apps to Apigee), request
and response flows, and policy attachments.
TargetEndpoint
Settings for the outbound HTTP connection (from Apigee to the backend service),
request and response flows, and policy attachments.
Flows
ProxyEndpoint and TargetEndpoint request and response pipelines to which policies can be
attached.
Policies
XML-formatted configuration files that conform to the Apigee policy schemas.
Resources
Scripts, JAR files, and XSLT files referenced by policies to execute custom logic.
Base configuration
/apiproxy/weatherapi.xml
The base configuration for an API proxy, which defines the name of the API proxy. The name
must be unique within an organization.
Sample configuration:
<APIProxy name="weatherapi">
</APIProxy>
Base configuration elements
Name
Description
Default
Required?
APIProxy
name
The name of the API proxy, which must be unique within an organization. The characters
you are allowed to use in the name are restricted to the following:
A-Za-z0-9_-
N/A
Yes
revision
The revision number of the API proxy configuration. You do not need to explicitly set
the revision number, since Apigee automatically tracks the current revision of the API
proxy.
N/A
No
ConfigurationVersion
The version of the API proxy configuration schema to which this API proxy conforms. The
only supported value currently is majorVersion 4 and minorVersion 0. This setting may be
used in the future to enable evolution of the API proxy format.
4.0
No
Description
A textual description of the API proxy. If provided, the description will display in
the Apigee UI.
N/A
No
DisplayName
A user-friendly name that may be different from the name attribute of the
API proxy configuration.
N/A
No
Policies
A list of policies in the /policies directory of this API proxy. You will
normally only see this element when the API proxy was created using the Apigee UI.
This is simply a manifest setting, designed to provide visibility into the contents of
the API proxy.
N/A
No
ProxyEndpoints
A list of proxy endpoints in the /proxies directory of this API proxy. You
will normally only see this element when the API proxy was created using the Apigee
UI. This is simply a manifest setting, designed to provide visibility into the
contents of the API proxy.
N/A
No
Resources
A list of resources (JavaScript, Python, Java, XSLT) in the /resources
directory of this API proxy. You will normally only see this element when the API proxy was
created using the Apigee UI. This is simply a manifest setting, designed to
provide visibility into the contents of the API proxy.

normally only see this element when the API proxy was created using Apigee.
This is simply a manifest setting, designed to provide visibility into the contents of
the API proxy.
N/A
No
TargetEndpoints
A list of target endpoints in the /targets directory of this API proxy. You
will normally only see this element when the API proxy was created using the Apigee UI. This is simply a manifest setting, designed to provide visibility into the
contents of the API proxy.
N/A
No
ProxyEndpoint
The following image shows the request/response flow:
/apiproxy/proxies/default.xml
The ProxyEndpoint configuration defines the inbound (client-facing) interface for an API
proxy. When you configure a proxy endpoint, you are setting up a network configuration that
defines how client applications ( apps ) should invoke the proxied API.
The following sample ProxyEndpoint configuration would be stored under
/apiproxy/proxies :
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
<PreFlow/>
<Flows/>
<PostFlow/>
<HTTPProxyConnection>
<BasePath>/weather</BasePath>
<Properties/>
</HTTPProxyConnection>
<FaultRules/>
<DefaultFaultRule/>
<RouteRule name="default">
<TargetEndpoint>default</TargetEndpoint>
</RouteRule>
</ProxyEndpoint>
The required configuration elements in a basic proxy endpoint are:
ProxyEndpoint configuration
elements
Name
Description
Default
Required?
ProxyEndpoint
name
The name of the proxy endpoint. Must be unique within the API proxy configuration, when
(in rare cases) multiple proxy endpoints are defined. The characters you are allowed to use
in the name are restricted to the following: A-Za-z0-9._\-$ % .
N/A
Yes
PreFlow
Defines the policies in the PreFlow flow of a request or response.
N/A
Yes
Flows
Defines the policies in the conditional flows of a request or response.
N/A
Yes
PostFlow
Defines the policies in the PostFlow flow of a request or response.
N/A
Yes
HTTPProxyConnection
Defines the network address and URI path associated with the API proxy.
BasePath
A required string that uniquely identifies the URI path used by Apigee to route
incoming messages to the proper API proxy.
The BasePath is a URI fragment (for example /weather ) appended to the
base URL of an API proxy (for example, http://apifactory-test.apigee.net ).
BasePath must be unique within an environment. Uniqueness is validated when an API proxy
is generated or imported.
Using a wildcard in base paths
You can use one or more "*" wildcards in API proxy base paths. For example, a base
path of /team/*/members allows clients to call
https://[host]/team/ blue /members and
https://[host]/team/ green /members without you needing to
create new API proxies to support new teams. Note that /**/ is not supported.
Important: Apigee does NOT support using a wildcard "*" as the first
element of a base path. For example, this is NOT supported: /*/search .
Starting the base path with a "*" can lead to unexpected errors because of the way Apigee
identifies valid paths.
/
Yes
Properties
A set of optional HTTP configuration settings can be defined as properties of a
<ProxyEndpoint> . Available properties include the following:
request.queryparams.ignore.content.type.charset
Use the property request.queryparams.ignore.content.type.charset to
tell the proxy to ignore the charset parameter of the Content-Type header
when processing the request URL. For
example:
<Properties>
<Property name="request.queryparams.ignore.content.type.charset">true</Property>
</Properties>
The following table shows example output depending on the setting of the charset
property and presence of the Content-Type header's charset parameter.
Property setting
Header value
Example output
charset=false
charset param not set
john.doe+test@gmail.com
charset=false
charset=utf-8
john.doe test@gmail.com
charset=true and no charset param in header.
charset param not set
john.doe+test@gmail.com
charset=true
charset=utf-8 param set
john.doe+test@gmail.com
request.payload.parse.limit
Use the property request.payload.parse.limit to set the maximum payload size that
can be processed in the request flow, in megabytes (M).
For example:
<Properties>
<Property name="request.payload.parse.limit">30M</Property>
</Properties>
The minimum configurable limit is 10M and the maximum configurable limit is 30M. If the property is not set, the default limit is 10M.
For more information, see Message payload size .
N/A
No
FaultRules
Defines how the proxy endpoint reacts to an error. A fault rule specifies two
items:
A Condition that specifies the fault to be handled based on the pre-defined
category, subcategory, or name of the fault
One or more policies that define the behavior of the fault rule for the
corresponding Condition
See Handling faults .
N/A
No
DefaultFaultRule
Handles any errors (system, transport, messaging or policy) that are not explicitly
handled by another fault rule.
See Handling faults .
N/A
No
RouteRule
Defines the destination of inbound request messages after processing by the
ProxyEndpoint request pipeline. Usually, the RouteRule points to a named target endpoint,
an IntegrationEndpoint, or an URL.
Name
Required attribute, which provides a name for the RouteRule. The characters you are
allowed to use in the name are restricted to the following: A-Za-z0-9._\-$ % . For
example, Cat2 %_ is a legal name.
N/A
Yes
Condition
An optional conditional statement used for dynamic routing at runtime. Conditional
RouteRules are useful, for example, to enable content-based routing to support backend
versioning.
N/A
No
TargetEndpoint
An optional string that identifies a named TargetEndpoint configuration. A named
target endpoint is any target endpoint defined in the same API proxy under
the /targets directory).
By naming a target endpoint, you indicate where request messages should be forwarded
after processing by the ProxyEndpoint request pipeline. Note that this is an optional
setting.
A proxy endpoint may call a URL directly. For example, a JavaScript or Java resource,
functioning in the role of an HTTP client, may perform the basic duty of a
target endpoint, which is to forward requests to a backend service.
N/A
No
URL
An optional string that defines an outbound network address called by the
proxy endpoint, bypassing any TargetEndpoint configurations that might be stored under
/targets
N/A
No
How to configure RouteRules
A named target endpoint refers to a configuration file under /apiproxy/targets to
which the RouteRule forwards a request after processing by the proxy endpoint.
For example, the following RouteRule refers to the configuration
/apiproxy/targets/myTarget.xml :
<RouteRule name="default">
<TargetEndpoint>myTarget</TargetEndpoint>
</RouteRule>
Direct URL invocation
A proxy endpoint can also directly invoke a backend service. Direct URL invocation bypasses any
named TargetEndpoint configuration under /apiproxy/targets ). For this reason,
TargetEndpoint is an optional API proxy configuration, although, in practice, direct invocation
from the proxy endpoint is not recommended.
For example, the following RouteRule makes an HTTP call to
http://api.mycompany.com/v2 .
<RouteRule name="default">
<URL>http://api.mycompany.com/v2</URL>
</RouteRule>
Conditional routes
RouteRules can be chained to support dynamic routing at runtime. Inbound requests can be
routed to named TargetEndpoint configurations, directly to URLs, or to a combination of the two,
based on HTTP headers, message content, query parameters, or contextual information such time of
day, locale, etc.
Conditional RouteRules work like other conditional statements on Apigee. See
Conditions reference
and Flow variables reference .
For example, the following RouteRule combination first evaluates the inbound request to verify
the value of an HTTP header. If the HTTP header routeTo has the value
TargetEndpoint1 , then the request is forwarded to the target endpoint named
TargetEndpoint1 . If not, then the inbound request is forwarded to
http://api.mycompany.com/v2 .
<RouteRule name="MyRoute">
<Condition>request.header.routeTo = "TargetEndpoint1"</Condition>
<TargetEndpoint>TargetEndpoint1</TargetEndpoint>
</RouteRule>
<RouteRule name="default">
<URL>http://api.mycompany.com/v2</URL>
</RouteRule>
Note: More dynamic routing
The Apigee community article specifying proxy endpoint
shows dynamic routing to different world regions based on variables extracted from the request URI.
Null routes
A null RouteRule can be defined to support scenarios in which the request message does not
need to be forwarded to the target endpoint. This is useful when the proxy endpoint performs all of
the necessary processing, for example by using JavaScript to call an external service or
retrieving data from a lookup to the Apigee key/value store.
For example, the following defines a null Route:
<RouteRule name="GoNowhere"/>
Conditional null Routes can be useful. In the following example, a null Route is configured to
execute when an HTTP header request.header.X-DoNothing have a value other than
null .
<RouteRule name="DoNothingOnDemand">
<Condition>request.header.X-DoNothing != null</Condition>
</RouteRule>
Remember, RouteRules can be chained, so a conditional null Route would typically be one
component of a set of RouteRules designed to support conditional routing.
A practical use of a conditional null Route would be in support of caching. By using the value
of the variable that is set by the Cache policy, you can configure an API proxy to execute the
null Route when an entry is served from the cache.
<RouteRule name="DoNothingUnlessTheCacheIsStale">
<Condition>lookupcache.LookupCache-1.cachehit is true</Condition>
</RouteRule>
TargetEndpoint
A target endpoint is the outbound equivalent of a proxy endpoint. A target endpoint functions as
client to a backend service or API—it sends requests and receives responses.
An API proxy needn't have any target endpoints. Proxy endpoints can be configured to call URLs
directly. An API proxy with no target endpoints usually contains a proxy endpoint that either
directly calls a backend service, or that is configured to call a service using Java or
JavaScript.
TargetEndpoint configuration
/targets/default.xml
The target endpoint defines the outbound connection from Apigee to another service or
resource.
Here's a sample TargetEndpoint configuration:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<PreFlow/>
<Flows/>
<PostFlow/>
<EventFlow/>
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net</URL>
<SSLInfo/>
<Authentication/>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
<FaultRules/>
<DefaultFaultRule/>
<ScriptTarget/>
<LocalTargetConnection/>
</TargetEndpoint>
TargetEndpoint configuration
elements
A target endpoint can call a target in one of the following ways:
HTTPTargetConnection for HTTP or HTTPS calls
LocalTargetConnection for local proxy-to-proxy chaining
Configure only one of these in a target endpoint.
Name
Description
Default
Required?
TargetEndpoint
name
The name of the target endpoint, which must be unique within the API proxy
configuration. The name of the target endpoint is used in the ProxyEndpoint RouteRule to
direct requests for outbound processing. The characters you are allowed to use in the name
are restricted to the following: A-Za-z0-9._\-$ % .
N/A
Yes
PreFlow
Defines the policies in the PreFlow flow of a request or response.
N/A
Yes
Flows
Defines the policies in the conditional flows of a request or response.
N/A
Yes
PostFlow
Defines the policies in the PostFlow flow of a request or response.
N/A
Yes
EventFlow
Defines the policies in the EventFlow flow of a response. The EventFlow is used
for streaming server-sent events. For more information, see
Streaming server-sent events .
N/A
No
HTTPTargetConnection
With its child elements, specifies a backend resource reached via HTTP.
If you use HTTPTargetConnection, don't configure other types of target connections
(ScriptTarget or LocalTargetConnection).
Note: The <LocalTargetConnection> elements support the dynamic string substitution feature called
message templating .
You can use the <Authentication> child element
to make authenticated calls to Google services or custom services running
on certain Google Cloud products, such as Cloud Functions and
Cloud Run .
Use of the <Authentication> element requires setup and deployment steps described in
Using Google authentication . With
proper setup, the policy creates an authentication token for you and adds it to the service request.
See also <Authentication> element usage .
URL
Defines the network address of the backend service to which the target endpoint forwards
request messages.
N/A
No
LoadBalancer
Defines one or more named TargetServer configurations. Named TargetServer
configurations can be used for load balancing defining 2 or more endpoint configuration
connections.
You can also use target servers to decouple API proxy configurations from concrete
backend service endpoints URLs.
N/A
No
Properties
A set of optional HTTP configuration settings can be defined as properties of a
<TargetEndpoint> .
Use the property response.payload.parse.limit to set the maximum payload size that
can be processed in the response flow, in megabytes (M).
For example:
<Properties>
<Property name="response.payload.parse.limit">15M</Property>
</Properties>
The minimum configurable limit is 10M and the maximum configurable limit is 30M. If the property is not set, the default limit is 10M.
For more information, see Message payload size .
N/A
No
SSLInfo
Optionally define TLS/SSL settings on a target endpoint to control the TLS/SSL
connection between the API proxy and the target service. See TLS/SSL TargetEndpoint Configuration .
Note: The <SSLInfo> element supports the dynamic string substitution feature called
message templating .
N/A
No
LocalTargetConnection
With its child elements, specifies a resource to be reached locally, bypassing network
characteristics such as load balancing and message processors.
To specify the target resource, include either the APIProxy child element (with the
ProxyEndpoint element) or the Path child element.
For more information, see Chaining API proxies
together .
If you use LocalTargetConnection, don't configure other types of target connections
(HTTPTargetConnection or ScriptTarget).
APIProxy
Specifies the name of an API proxy to use as a target for requests. The target proxy
must be in the same organization and environment as the proxy sending requests. This is an
alternative to using the Path element.
N/A
No
ProxyEndpoint
Used with APIProxy to specify the name of the target proxy's proxy endpoint.
N/A
No
Path
Specifies the endpoint path of an API proxy to use as a target for requests. The target
proxy must be in the same organization and environment as the proxy sending requests. This
is an alternative to using APIProxy.
N/A
No
FaultRules
Defines how the target endpoint reacts to an error. A fault rule specifies two
items:
A Condition that specifies the fault to be handled based on the pre-defined
category, subcategory, or name of the fault
One or more policies that define the behavior of the fault rule for the
corresponding Condition
See Handling faults .
N/A
No
DefaultFaultRule
Handles any errors (system, transport, messaging or policy) that are not explicitly
handled by another FaultRule.
See Handling faults .
N/A
No
<Authentication> element usage
The use of the <Authentication> element in <TargetEndpoint> is identical to the usage
of the <Authentication> element in the
ServiceCallout policy. In both <TargetEndpoint> and ServiceCallout, <Authentication> is a subelement
of <HttpTargetConnection> . For details, see Authentication element
in the ServiceCallout policy reference.
<Authentication> element error reference
If you are using the <Authentication> element, you can find possible error messages and troubleshooting
tips for deployment and runtime errors in the Errors section
of the ServiceCallout policy documentation.
<Authentication> element examples
The following example shows how to call a service deployed on Cloud Run as the target using
the Authentication element to generate an OpenID Connect token needed to authenticate
the call:
<TargetEndpoint name="TargetEndpoint-1">
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<Properties/>
<URL>https://cloudrun-hostname.a.run.app/test</URL>
<Authentication>
<GoogleIDToken>
<Audience>https://cloudrun-hostname.a.run.app/test</Audience>
</GoogleIDToken>
</Authentication>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
The following example shows how to call a TargetService that points to Cloud Run using
the Authentication element to generate an OpenID Connect token needed to authenticate
the call. The HeaderName element adds the generated bearer token to a header named
X-Serverless-Authorization that is sent to the target system. The Authorization header,
if present, is left unmodified and also sent in the request.
< TargetEndpoint name = "TargetEndpoint-1" >
< HTTPTargetConnection >
< Authentication >
< HeaderName>X - Serverless - Authorization < / HeaderName >
< GoogleIDToken >
< Audience ref = "flow.variable.audience" > https : // cloudrun - hostname . a . run . app < / Audience >
< / GoogleIDToken >
< / Authentication >
< LoadBalancer >
< Server name = "cloud-run-target" / >
< / LoadBalancer >
< / HTTPTargetConnection >
< / TargetEndpoint >
The following example shows how to call a TargetService that points to the Google
Secret Manager service.
In this example, the GoogleAccessToken element is configured to
generate a Google Auth Token to authenticate the target request:
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<Authentication>
<GoogleAccessToken>
<Scopes>
<Scope>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform</Scope>
</Scopes>
</GoogleAccessToken>
</Authentication>
<URL>
https://secretmanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/project-id/secrets/secret-id
</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
The following example shows how to automatically set the audience of the GoogleIDToken. When
useTargetUrl is true and the referenced variable does not resolve to
a valid variable, the URL of the target (excluding query params) is used as the audience.
Suppose
the request path is /foobar and the target server URL is https://xyz.com ,
the audience of the GoogleIDToken will automatically be set to https://xyz.com/foobar .
Apigee hybrid users:
If you use Apigee hybrid, note that the useTargetUrl attribute is available in
Apigee hybrid version 1.8 and later versions.
< TargetEndpoint name = "TargetEndpoint-1" >
< HTTPTargetConnection >
< Authentication >
< GoogleIDToken >
< Audience ref = 'myvariable' useTargetUrl = "true" / >
< / GoogleIDToken >
< / Authentication >
< LoadBalancer >
< Server name = "TS" / >
< / LoadBalancer >
< / HTTPTargetConnection >
< / TargetEndpoint >
TLS/SSL TargetEndpoint configuration
Target endpoints often need to manage HTTPS connections with heterogeneous backend
infrastructure. For this reason, a number of TLS/SSL configuration settings are supported.
Note: TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the updated version of the
now-deprecated SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) specification. Because Apigee originally
supported SSL, you may see some instances in the Apigee UI and in the Apigee
configuration elements that use the term SSL . However, Apigee uses TLS
exclusively.
Important: Public Certificate Authorities (CAs) are discontinuing the inclusion of the clientAuth Extended Key Usage (EKU) in latest publicly-trusted SSL/TLS certificates. This industry-wide change affects Apigee mutual TLS (mTLS) configurations in Apigee platform .
Apigee requires the clientAuth EKU to be present in client certificates for mTLS handshakes. Without this EKU, mTLS connections will fail for both northbound (client to Apigee) and southbound (Apigee to backend) traffic. For a detailed explanation of the issue, timelines, and recommended solutions, refer to this blog post .
TLS/SSL
TargetEndpoint configuration elements
Name
Description
Default
Required?
SSLInfo
The <SSLInfo> block can be used for both one-way and two-way TLS/SSL.
Enabled
When set to true ,
specifies that the target connection should use the
SSL protocol in accordance with any other parameters specified in this
<SSLInfo> block.
When set to false ,
specifies that the target connection should not use SSL.
However, if the enclosing <HTTPTargetConnection> block contains
a <URL> element that evaluates to a string that begins with
https:// ,
then the SSL protocol will be used even if <Enabled> is false.
In this case, the entire <SSLInfo> block is ignored.
Conversely, if there is a <URL> element that begins with
http:// , then the SSL protocol will not be used even if
<Enabled> is true.
false
No
Enforce
Enforces strict SSL between Apigee and the target backend.
If set to true , connections will fail for targets with invalid certs, expired certs,
self-signed certs, certs with a hostname mismatch, and certs with an untrusted root. A
failure code of 4xx or 5xx is returned.
If unset, or set to false , the result of connections to target backends with
problematic certs depends upon the setting of <IgnoreValidationErrors> (see below).
A success response ( 2xx ) can occur under certain conditions, if
<IgnoreValidationErrors> is set to true .
You can override the Enforce field at the environment level with the feature flag SSLInfo.Enforce .
See Specifying environment-level SSL enforcement .
false
No
TrustStore
A keystore containing trusted root server certificates. Apigee will treat the remote
peer as trusted if the certificate chain it sends terminates in a certificate that
is contained in this keystore.
N/A
No
ClientAuthEnabled
If set to true , enables two-way TLS (also known as mutual TLS or mTLS)
between Apigee and the remote peer - either the API client, or the target backend.
Enabling two-way TLS typically requires that you set up both a truststore and a
keystore on Apigee.
false
No
KeyStore
A keystore containing private keys used for outbound client authentication
N/A
Yes (if ClientAuthEnabled is true)
KeyAlias
The key alias of the private key used for outbound client authentication
N/A
Yes (if ClientAuthEnabled is true)
IgnoreValidationErrors
Indicates whether validation errors are ignored. If the backend system uses SNI and returns
a cert with a subject Distinguished Name (DN) that does not match the hostname,
there is no way to ignore the error and the connection fails.
Note : If <Enforce> is set to true , the value of
<IgnoreValidationErrors> is ignored.
false
No
Ciphers
Supported ciphers for outbound TLS/SSL. If no ciphers are specified, then all ciphers
available for the JVM will be permitted.
To restrict ciphers, add the following elements listing the supported ciphers:
<Ciphers>
<Cipher>TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA</Cipher>
<Cipher>TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA</Cipher>
</Ciphers>
N/A
No
Protocols
Supported protocols for outbound TLS/SSL. If no protocols are specified, then all
protocols available for the JVM will be permitted.
To restrict protocols, specify them explicitly. For example, to allow only TLS v1.2 or TLS v1.3:
<Protocols>
<Protocol>TLSv1.2</Protocol>
<Protocol>TLSv1.3</Protocol>
</Protocols>
Note: TLS 1.0 is not supported for Apigee Hybrid for southbound connections.
N/A
No
CommonName
Apigee checks the value here against the CN (Common Name) or SANs
(Subject Alternate Names) on the remote peer certificate.
N/A
No
Specifying environment-level SSL enforcement
If SSLInfo.Enforce is set to true or false , the value specified overrides any granular
enforcement options specified in <SSLInfo> blocks in TargetEndpoint or TargetServer
configurations.
If SSLInfo.Enforce is unset, SSL enforcement is determined by any values specified using the
<Enforce> element within individual <SSLInfo> blocks. For more information, see
TLS/SSL
TargetEndpoint configuration.
In the following example, SSLInfo.Enforce is set to true . In the resulting
output, you can see that SSL is enforced in the specified environment.
Note The API call in the example
does not preserve the settings of any previously specified feature flags. In this call, you must re-specify
any settings that you want to preserve.

Options for configuring TLS .
Using
flow variables to set TLS/SSL values dynamically
You can also dynamically set TLS/SSL details to support flexible runtime requirements.
For example, if your proxy connects to two potentially different targets (a test target and a
production target), you can have your API proxy programmatically detect which environment it's
calling and dynamically set references to the appropriate keystore and truststore. The
Dynamic SSLInfo for TargetEndpoint using variable reference
Apigee Community article explains this scenario in more detail and provides deployable API
proxy examples.
In the following example of how the <SSLInfo> tag would be set in a
TargetEndpoint configuration, the values can be supplied at runtime, for example, by a Java
Callout, a JavaScript policy, or an AssignMessage policy . Use whichever message variables
contain the values you want to set.
Variables are allowed in only the following elements.
Note: These elements support the dynamic string substitution feature called
message templating .
< SSLInfo >
< Enabled > { myvars . ssl . enabled } < / Enabled >
< ClientAuthEnabled > { myvars . ssl . client . auth . enabled } < / ClientAuthEnabled >
< KeyStore > { myvars . ssl . keystore } < / KeyStore >
< KeyAlias > { myvars . ssl . keyAlias } < / KeyAlias >
< TrustStore > { myvars . ssl . trustStore } < / TrustStore >
< / SSLInfo >
Note: Variable replacement of TLS/SSL values can only be used for
a target endpoint. Any attempt to use variables in any other context, such as message logging, will cause validation failures.
Using
references to set TLS/SSL values dynamically
When configuring a target endpoint that uses HTTPS, you have to consider the case when the
TLS/SSL cert expires, or a change to the system configuration requires you to update the cert.
For more information, see
Handling expired certificates .
However, you can optionally configure the target endpoint to use a reference to the
keystore or truststore instead. The advantage to using a reference is that you can update the
reference to point to a different keystore or truststore to update the TLS/SSL cert without
having to restart Message Processors.
Note: You can only use a reference to the keystore and truststore; you
cannot use a reference to the alias. When you change the reference to a keystore, ensure that the
alias name of the cert is the same as in the old keystore.
For example, shown below is a target endpoint that uses a reference to the keystore:
<SSLInfo>
<Enabled>true</Enabled>
<ClientAuthEnabled>false</ClientAuthEnabled>
<KeyStore>ref://keystoreref</KeyStore>
<KeyAlias>myKeyAlias</KeyAlias>
</SSLInfo>
Use the following POST API call to create the reference named
keystoreref :
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ {org} /environments/ {env} /references" \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d '<ResourceReference name=" keystoreref ">
<Refers> myTestKeystore </Refers>
<ResourceType>KeyStore</ResourceType>
</ResourceReference>'
Where $TOKEN is set to your OAuth 2.0 access token, as described in
Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token . For information about the curl options used in this example, see
Using curl . For a description of environment variables you can use, see
Setting
environment variables for Apigee API requests .
The reference specifies the name of the keystore and its type.
Use the following GET API call to view the reference:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ {org} /environments/ {env} /references/keystoreref" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Where $TOKEN is set to your OAuth 2.0 access token, as described in
Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token . For information about the curl options used in this example, see
Using curl . For a description of environment variables you can use, see
Setting
environment variables for Apigee API requests .
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ {org} /environments/ {env} /references/keystoreref" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Where $TOKEN is set to your OAuth 2.0 access token, as described in
Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token . For information about the curl options used in this example, see
Using curl . For a description of environment variables you can use, see
Setting
environment variables for Apigee API requests .
To later change the reference to point to a different keystore, ensuring that the alias has
the same name, use the following PUT call:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ {org} /environments/ {env} /references/ keystoreref " \
-X PUT \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d '<ResourceReference name=" keystoreref ">
<Refers> myNewKeystore </Refers>
<ResourceType>KeyStore</ResourceType>
</ResourceReference>'
Where $TOKEN is set to your OAuth 2.0 access token, as described in
Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token . For information about the curl options used in this example, see
Using curl . For a description of environment variables you can use, see
Setting
environment variables for Apigee API requests .
TargetEndpoint
with target load balancing
Target endpoints support load balancing across multiple named target servers using three load
balancing algorithms.
For detailed instructions, refer to
Load balancing across backend servers .
IntegrationEndpoint
An IntegrationEndpoint is a target endpoint that specifically runs Apigee integrations .
If you have configured an IntegrationEndpoint, Apigee sends the request object
to Apigee's Integration Platform for execution. To run your integration, in addition to configuring the
IntegrationEndpoint, you must also add the SetIntegrationRequest policy
in your proxy flow.
You can configure your integration to execute either synchronously or asynchronously
by setting the <AsyncExecution> element in the IntegrationEndpoint configuration. For more information, see Synchronous vs Asynchronous execution .
After running the integration, Apigee saves the response in the
response message .
Note : You need an authentication token to run the IntegrationEndpoint.
However, there is no explicit <Authentication> element in the IntegrationEndpoint
definition. Apigee adds an authentication token to the request under the hood. For the
IntegrationEndpoint to successfully authenticate, you must deploy your API proxy
with a service account that has the required IAM roles to run an integration. For information
about the required roles, see IAM roles for integrations .
For more details on deploying an API proxy, see Deploy on Apigee .
Configuring IntegrationEndpoint
To configure an integration endpoint as your target endpoint, add the IntegrationEndpoint
element to your ProxyEndpoint configuration. The following is a sample ProxyEndpoint configuration:
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
<Description/>
<FaultRules/>
<PreFlow name="PreFlow">
<Request>
<Step>
<Name>my-set-integration-request-policy</Name>
</Step>
</Request>
</PreFlow>
<Flows/>
<PostFlow name="PostFlow"/>
<HTTPProxyConnection>
<BasePath>/integration-endpoint-test</BasePath>
<Properties/>
</HTTPProxyConnection>
<RouteRule name="default">
<IntegrationEndpoint>my-int-endpoint</IntegrationEndpoint>
</RouteRule>
</ProxyEndpoint>
In the sample ProxyEndpoint configuration, Apigee performs the following tasks:
In the PreFlow, executes the policy named my-set-integration-request-policy ,
which sets the integration request object and integration flow variables.
Uses my-int-endpoint as the target endpoint, as specified in the RouteRule .
Reads the integration request object created by the my-set-integration-request-policy .
Sends the request to Apigee's Integration Platform using the request object and flow variables set by the SetIntegrationRequest policy.
Saves the response of the integration in the response message.
The XML file containing the <IntegrationEndpoint> declaration will be available in
the APIGEE_BUNDLE_DIRECTORY /apiproxy/integration-endpoints/ directory. If you create your API proxy
using the Develop > API Proxies > CREATE NEW > Integration target option, Apigee
stores the declaration in the /apiproxy/integration-endpoints/default.xml file. If you
create the integration endpoint XML from the UI, you can provide a custom name for the XML file.
The following example shows the declaration of the <IntegrationEndpoint> element
in the XML file:
<IntegrationEndpoint name="my-int-endpoint">
<AsyncExecution>false</AsyncExecution>
</IntegrationEndpoint>
IntegrationEndpoint configuration elements
Name
Description
Default
Required?
IntegrationEndpoint
name
The name of the IntegrationEndpoint. The characters
you can use in the name are restricted to:
A-Za-z0-9._\-$ %
N/A
Yes
AsyncExecution
A Boolean value that specifies if the integration should run in synchronous or asynchronous mode.
For more information, see Synchronous vs Asynchronous execution .
false
No
Synchronous vs Asynchronous execution
You can configure the integration to run in either synchronous or asynchronous mode. To understand the
difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution modes,
see <AsyncExecution> .
Use the <AsyncExecution> element within the </IntegrationEndpoint> to
specify synchronous or asynchronous execution. If you set
<AsyncExecution> to true , the integration runs asynchronously. And if you
set it to false , the integration runs synchronously.
The following example sets the AsyncExecution to true :
<IntegrationEndpoint name="my-int-endpoint">
<AsyncExecution>true</AsyncExecution>
</IntegrationEndpoint>
Policies
The /policies directory in an API proxy contains all policies available to be
attached to Flows in the API proxy.
Policy configuration elements
Name
Description
Default
Required?
Policy
name
The internal name of the policy. Characters you can use in the name are restricted
to: A-Za-z0-9._\-$ % . However, the Apigee UI enforces additional
restrictions, such as automatically removing characters that are not alphanumeric.
Optionally, use the <DisplayName> element to label the
policy in the Apigee UI proxy editor with a different, natural-language name.
N/A
Yes
enabled
Set to true to enforce the policy.
Set to false to turn off the policy. The policy will not be
enforced even if it remains attached to a flow.
true
No
continueOnError
Set to false to return an error when a policy fails. This is
expected behavior for most policies.
Set to true to have flow execution continue even after a policy
fails.
false
No
async
Note : This attribute does not make the policy execute
asynchronously. In most cases, leave this with the default of false .
When set to true , policy execution is offloaded to a different
thread, leaving the main thread free to handle additional requests. When the offline
processing is complete, the main thread comes back and finishes handling the message
flow. In some cases, setting async to true improves API proxy
performance. However, overusing async can hurt performance with too much thread
switching.
To use asynchronous behavior in API proxies, see JavaScript object model .
false
No
Policy attachment
The following image shows the API proxy flows execution sequence:
As shown above:
Policies are attached as processing steps to Flows . The policy's name is used to
reference the policy to be enforced as a processing Step. The format of a policy attachment is
the following:
<Step><Name>MyPolicy</Name></Step>
Policies are enforced in the order in which they are attached to a Flow. For example:
<Step><Name>FirstPolicy</Name></Step>
<Step><Name>SecondPolicy</Name></Step>
Policy attachment configuration
elements
Name
Description
Default
Required?
Step
Name
The name of the policy to be executed by this Step definition.
N/A
Yes
Condition
A conditional statement that determines whether the policy is enforced or not. If a
policy has an associated condition, then the policy only executes if the conditional
statement evaluates to true.
N/A
No
Flows
ProxyEndpoint and TargetEndpoint define a pipeline for request and response message
processing. A processing pipeline consists of a request flow and a response flow. Each request
flow and response flow is subdivided into a PreFlow, one or more optional conditional or
named flows, and a PostFlow.
PreFlow: Always executes. Executes before any conditional Flows.
PostFlow: Always executes. Executes after any conditional Flows.
Additionally, you can add a PostClientFlow to the proxy endpoint, which executes after the
response is returned to the requesting client app. Only the MessageLogging policy can be attached
to this flow. PostClientFlow reduces API proxy latency and makes information available for
logging that is not calculated until after the response is returned to the client, such as the
client.sent.start.timestamp and client.sent.end.timestamp .The flow is used
primarily for measuring the time interval between the start and end timestamps for the response
message.
Here's an example of a PostClientFlow with a message logging policy attached.
...
<PostFlow name="PostFlow">
<Request/>
<Response/>
</PostFlow>
<PostClientFlow>
<Request/>
<Response>
<Step>
<Name>Message-Logging-1</Name>
</Step>
</Response>
</PostClientFlow>
...
The API proxy processing pipeline executes Flows in the following sequence:
Request Pipeline:
Proxy Request PreFlow
Proxy Request Conditional Flows (Optional)
Proxy Request PostFlow
Target Request PreFlow
Target Request Conditional Flows (Optional)
Target Request PostFlow
Response Pipeline:
Target Response PreFlow
Target Response Conditional Flows (Optional)
Target Response PostFlow
Proxy Response PreFlow
Proxy Response Conditional Flows (Optional)
Proxy Response PostFlow
PostClientFlow Response (Optional)
Only those Flows with policy attachments need to be configured in ProxyEndpoint or
TargetEndpoint configurations. PreFlow and PostFlow need only be specified in a ProxyEndpoint or
TargetEndpoint configuration when a policy needs to be enforced during PreFlow or PostFlow
processing.
In contrast to conditional flows, the ordering of PreFlow and PostFlow elements is not
important--the API proxy will always execute each at the appropriate point in the pipeline,
regardless of where they appear in the Endpoint configuration.
Conditional flows
Proxy endpoints and target endpoints support an unlimited number of conditional flows (also
known as named flows ).
The API proxy tests for the condition specified in the conditional flow and, if the condition
is met, the processing steps in the conditional flow are executed by the API proxy. If the
condition is not met, then the processing steps in the conditional flow are bypassed. Conditional
flows are evaluated in the order defined in the API proxy and the first one whose condition is
met is executed.
By defining conditional flows, you gain the ability to apply processing steps in an API proxy
based on:
Request URI
HTTP verb ( GET / PUT / POST / DELETE )
Value of a query param, header, and form param
Many other types of conditions
For example, the following conditional flow specifies that it is executed only when the
request resource path is /accesstoken . Any inbound request with the
path /accesstoken causes this flow to be executed, along with any policies
that are attached to the flow. If the request path does not include the suffix
/accesstoken , then the flow does not execute (although another conditional flow
might).
<Flows>
<Flow name="TokenEndpoint">
<Condition>proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/accesstoken"</Condition>
<Request>
<Step>
<Name>GenerateAccessToken</Name>
</Step>
</Request>
</Flow>
</Flows>
Flow configuration elements
Name
Description
Default
Required?
Flow
A request or response processing pipeline defined by a proxy endpoint or
target endpoint
Name
The unique name of the Flow.
N/A
Yes
Condition
A conditional statement that evaluates one or more variables to evaluate to true or
false. All Flows other than the predefined PreFlow and PostFlow types must define a
condition for their execution. However, if you include a single flow without a
condition at the end of a sequence of flows, it will act as the "Else"
statement at the end of the sequence of flows.
N/A
Yes
Request
The pipeline associated with Request message processing
N/A
No
Response
The pipeline associated with Response message processing
N/A
No
Step processing
The sequential ordering of conditional Flows is enforced by Apigee. Conditional Flows
execute from top to bottom. The first conditional Flow whose condition evaluates to
true is executed, and only one conditional Flow is executed.
For example, in the following Flow configuration, any inbound request that does not include
the path suffix /first or /second will cause the ThirdFlow
to execute, enforcing the policy called Return404 .
<Flows>
<Flow name="FirstFlow">
<Condition>proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/first"</Condition>
<Request>
<Step><Name>FirstPolicy</Name></Step>
</Request>
</Flow>
<Flow name="SecondFlow">
<Condition>proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/second"</Condition>
<Request>
<Step><Name>FirstPolicy</Name></Step>
<Step><Name>SecondPolicy</Name></Step>
</Request>
</Flow>
<Flow name="ThirdFlow">
<Request>
<Step><Name>Return404</Name></Step>
</Request>
</Flow>
</Flows>
Resources
"Resources" (resource files for use in API proxies) are scripts, code, and XSL transformations
that can be attached to Flows using policies. These appear in the Scripts section of the API
proxy editor in the Apigee UI.
See Managing resources for the supported
resource types.
Resources can be stored in an API proxy, an environment, or an organization. In each case, a
resource is referenced by name in a Policy. Apigee resolves the name by moving from the API
proxy, to environment, to organization level.
A resource stored at the organization level can be referenced by Policies in any environment.
A resource stored at the environment level can be referenced by Policies in that environment. A
resource stored at the API proxy level can be referenced only by Policies in that API proxy.
