What you need to know about Java permission
policies
If you are developing a JavaCallout policy, you need to know which permission policies are in
effect in the Apigee JVM and how they will affect your code. For example, your custom Java code
does not have unlimited access to the file system. However, in the case of file system access,
you can read certain files, such as policy resource files. But most other file system access is
blocked. This topic lists all of JDK permission types and their respective targets or actions.
For each target or action, we specify the permission policy and any exceptions that you need to
know about.
To learn more about the JDK permission types and what each permission allows, see Permissions in
the Java Development Kit (JDK) .

java.net.SocketPermission
Represents access to a network via sockets. A SocketPermission consists of a host
specification and a set of "actions" specifying ways to connect to that host.
host = (hostname | IPaddress)[:portrange]
portrange = portnumber | -portnumber | portnumber-[portnumber]
The possible ways to connect to the host are
accept
connect
listen
resolve
The "listen" action is only meaningful when used with "localhost". The "resolve" (resolve
host/ip name service lookups) action is implied when any of the other actions are
present.
resolve
YES
connect
YES but restrictions apply. See Restrictions .
Apigee restricts access to sitelocal, anylocal, loopback, and linklocal addresses, as well as private IPv4
ranges defined in RFC1918.
listen,
accept
NO
java.net.URLPermission
Represents permission to access a resource or set of resources defined by a given url, and
for a given set of user-settable request methods and request headers. The name of the
permission is the url string. The actions string is a concatenation of the request methods
and headers. The range of method and header names is not restricted by this class.
YES
LinkPermission
The Permission class for link creation operations.
hard
NO
symbolic
NO
java.security.SecurityPermission
A SecurityPermission contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but no actions
list; you either have the named permission or you don't.
The target name is the name of a security configuration parameter (see below). Currently
the SecurityPermission object is used to guard access to the Policy, Security, Provider,
Signer, and Identity objects.

java.util.logging.LoggingPermission
A SecurityManager will check the java.util.logging.LoggingPermission object when code
running with a SecurityManager calls one of the logging control methods (such as
Logger.setLevel).
control
NO
java.util.PropertyPermission
The name is the name of the property ("java.home", "os.name", etc). The naming convention
follows the hierarchical property naming convention. Also, an asterisk may appear at the
end of the name, following a ".", or by itself, to signify a wildcard match. For example:
"java.*" or "*" is valid, "*java" or "a*b" is not valid.
The actions to be granted are passed to the constructor in a string containing a list of
zero or more comma-separated keywords.
read
YES
write
NO
javax.xml.ws.WebServicePermission

javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission
Protect access to private Credentials belonging to a particular Subject. The Subject is
represented by a Set of Principals. The target name of this Permission specifies a
Credential class name, and a Set of Principals. The only valid value for this Permission's
actions is, "read".
CredentialClass {PrincipalClass "PrincipalName"}*
NO
javax.security.auth.kerberos.ServicePermission
Protect Kerberos services and the credentials necessary to access those services.
initiate
NO
accept
NO
javax.security.auth.kerberos.DelegationPermission
Used to restrict the usage of the Kerberos delegation model; ie, forwardable and proxiable
tickets.
The target name of this Permission specifies a pair of kerberos service principals. The
first is the subordinate service principal being entrusted to use the Ticket Granting
Ticket (TGT). The second service principal designates the target service the subordinate
service principal is to interact with on behalf of the initiating KerberosPrincipal.
