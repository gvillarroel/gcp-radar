In a conditional flow,
policies are executed only if the flow's condition evaluates to
true (as opposed to policies attached to the PreFlow or PostFlow,
which are always executed). This section describes how to create a conditional flow.
About conditional flows
During the processing of a request and response, only one conditional flow is executed per
segment—the first flow whose condition evaluates to true .
You can create conditions that include
|| (OR) and && (AND) operators. However, by default, the
|| operator has higher precedence than the && operator. For example, a condition written
as A && B || C && D is evaluated as A && (B || C) && D . Make sure to
parenthesize the expression if you want to change the precedence when using these operators.
The following examples illustrate some ways to use conditional flows.
Example 1
The following ProxyEndpoint definition shows a conditional flow that is executed
by the ProxyEndpoint on any HTTP GET request to the API proxy:
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
<PreFlow>
<Request/>
<Response/>
</PreFlow>
<Flows>
<Flow name="Flow-1">
<Condition>request.verb="GET"</Condition>
<Request/>
<Response/>
</Flow>
</Flows>
<PostFlow>
<Request/>
<Response/>
</PostFlow>
...
</ProxyEndpoint>
Notice that the condition references the request.verb
flow
variable . A flow variable is named references that hold state information associated
with an API transaction processed by Apigee. Apigee defines many state variables that you can
reference.
Example 2
If your
service backend provides weather reports and weather forecasts, your API might define two
conditional flows that map to those API
resources: /reports and /forecasts . When an API call
includes one of those resources in the URL, the condition evaluates to true and the logic
attached to the conditional flow is executed.
App developers then access your resources by making requests to a URL in the form:
http://myAPIs.myCo.com/weather/reports
or:
http://myAPIs.myCo.com/weather/forecasts
In an API proxy, you can define a conditional flow that corresponds to a specific
resource:
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
<PreFlow>
<Request/>
<Response/>
</PreFlow>
<Flows>
<Flow name="Flow-1">
<Condition>(proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/reports")</Condition>
<Request/>
<Response/>
</Flow>
<Flow name="Flow-2">
<Condition>(proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/forecasts")</Condition>
<Request/>
<Response/>
</Flow>
</Flows>
<PostFlow>
<Request/>
<Response/>
</PostFlow>
...
</ProxyEndpoint>
In this example, you reference the proxy.pathsuffix flow variable,
which contains the suffix portion of the URL used to access the API proxy. You can then attach
different policies to the conditional flow for each resource.
Example: Creating a conditional flow
The next example:
Creates a conditional flow that executes only when the request message
is an HTTP GET .
Adds a policy to the new flow.
Adding a conditional flow
To add a conditional flow:
Select the Develop tab in the Proxy Editor.
Select Proxy endpoints > default in the left-hand pane.
Note: You may need to expand the visual editor in the right-hand pane to see all the
elements.
To do so, click and drag the divider between the visual editor and the text editor
down a little.
Click the + button above the Response pane.
In the Add conditional flow dialog, select Path and verb , and in the
Path field, enter the path suffix that you want to be in the request path in order for
the conditional flow to execute. See Example 2 above.
Note: If you don't want to include a path condition, simply enter
/ in the Path field, as shown below. This will be matched for any request.
The conditional flow only executes if the request is
a GET request (but not for PUT , POST , etc.).
The new flow, called Flow-1 , now appears in the Proxy Endpoint pane.
The XML code for the new conditional flow is displayed in the text editor.
You can edit the Condition element if you wish. See
Adding logic
to flows .
Attaching a policy to the flow
Now that you have created the conditional flow, you can attach a policy to it. The next example
adds a Quota policy, which restricts the number of request messages that an API proxy allows over
a period of time, to the flow:
In the left-hand pane, click the + button to the right of Policies .
In the Create policy dialog, click in the Select policy type field and
scroll down to Traffic Management and select Quota .
Click Create to create the policy.
Click the + button next to Flow-1 in the Request pane.
In the Add policy step dialog, click in the Select existing policy field
and select Quota-1 .
Click Add .
The Request pane now displays the flow and attached policy, Quota-1 .
The text editor now displays a step containing the Quota-1 policy in the
Flow-1 element of the XML:
With this configuration, the Quota policy will be enforced for GET requests.
Requests of other types will not contribute to the maximum number of requests in the Quota policy.
