Many error conditions can arise while API proxies are servicing requests from apps. For
example, API proxies might encounter network issues when communicating with backend services,
apps might present expired credentials, request messages might be incorrectly formatted, and so
on.
When an error occurs after a client app calls an API proxy, an error message gets returned to
the client. By default, the client receives an often cryptic error message with no details or
guidance. But if you want to replace default error messages with more useful custom messages, and
even enrich them with things like additional HTTP headers, you need to set up custom fault
handling in Apigee.
Custom fault handling also lets you add functionality such as message logging whenever an
error occurs.
Tip: Fault handling is a major architectural design task for API
proxy development. It's important to take the time to figure out how and when you're going to
handle errors, determine what error messages will say, and design error message formats. After
(or as) you figure those things out, then use this topic to help you implement your own custom
fault handling.
Before we talk about implementing custom error handling in your API proxies, it's helpful to
understand how errors occur and how API proxies react to them.

How errors occur
First we'll simply cover how errors occur. Knowing how errors occur helps you plan
for the different situations in which you want to implement custom error handling.
Automatic errors
An API proxy throws an error automatically in the following situations:
A policy throws an error. For example, if an API call sends an expired key, the
VerifyAPIKey policy automatically throws an error; or if the number of API calls
exceeds a certain limit, the Quota policy or SpikeArrest policy throws an error.
(See the Policy error reference for the
types of errors policies can throw).
There's an issue in the API proxy message flow, such as a routing error.
There's a backend failure, such as an HTTP error due to protocol level failures, TLS/SSL
errors, or an unavailable target service.
There's a system-level failure, such as an out-of-memory exception.
For more information on these errors, see Fault taxonomy in this topic.
Custom errors
For situations where there's not an automatic error, you may want to throw a custom error; for
example, if a response contains the word unavailable , or if the HTTP status code is greater
than 201 . Do this by adding a RaiseFault policy to the
appropriate place in an API proxy flow.
You can add a RaiseFault policy to an API proxy flow the same as you do any other policy. In
the following proxy configuration example, the Raise-Fault-1 policy is attached to
the TargetEndpoint response. If the word unavailable is present in the response from the target
service, the RaiseFault policy gets executed and throws an error.
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
...
<Response>
<Step>
<Name>Raise-Fault-1</Name>
<Condition>message.content Like "*unavailable*"</Condition>
</Step>
</Response>
This is just to show you that you can throw custom errors. We go into more detail about the
RaiseFault policy in the FaultRules vs. the RaiseFault policy
section.
For more examples, see these Apigee Community posts:
Referencing JavaScript variables in RaiseFault
What API proxies do when errors occur
Here's what happens when a proxy throws an error.
Exit the proxy pipeline
When an API proxy encounters an error, regardless of how it occurs, it exits the
normal flow pipeline , enters
an error state, and returns an error message to the client app. Once the API proxy enters the
error state, it cannot return processing back to the normal flow pipeline.
For example, assume an API proxy has policies in the following order in the ProxyEndpoint
request:
Verify API Key
Quota
JSON to XML
If an error occurs during API key verification, the API proxy moves into an error state. The
Quota and JSON to XML policies are not executed, the proxy doesn't proceed to the TargetEndpoint,
and an error message is returned to the client app.
Check for FaultRules
In the error state, API proxies also check for the presence of the following (in order) in the
API proxy configuration before returning a default error message to the client app:
A <FaultRules> section, which contains the logic to
trigger custom error messages (and other policies) based on specific conditions that you
define.
A <DefaultFaultRule> section, which triggers a default
error message in the following situations:
No <FaultRules> are defined.
No existing <FaultRules> get executed.
The <AlwaysEnforce> element is set to true.
In essence, the API proxy is giving you the opportunity to return a custom error message and
trigger other logic. If the proxy finds neither of those sections, or they exist but no custom
fault was triggered, the proxy sends its own Apigee-generated default message.
Simple fault handling example
Sample: Learn by doing!
If you want to see a simple fault handling example in action, check out this
Learn by doing example in the Apigee GitHub samples. Just clone the repository and
follow the instructions in that topic. You can always come back to this section for more details
on how simple fault handling is implemented.
Let's start with a simple example, where a call to an API proxy doesn't contain a required API
key. By default, following is the response that gets returned to the client app:
HTTP / 1.1 401 Unauthorized
Date : Wed, 20 Jul 2016 19:19:32 GMT
Content-Type : application/json
Content-Length : 150
Connection : keep-alive
Server : Apigee Router
* Co nne c t io n # 0 t o hos t myorg - test .apigee. net le ft i nta c t
{ "fault" :{ "faultstring" : "Failed to resolve API Key variable request.queryparam.apikey" , "detail" :{ "errorcode" : "steps.oauth.v2.FailedToResolveAPIKey" }}}
Your API users may be able to figure out the error message, but they may not. And many default
errors are more subtle and harder to decipher.
As an API developer, it's up to you to change this message to meet the needs of whoever will
ultimately receive the error message, whether it's an iOS app developer or an internal testing
group that has its own error message format requirements.
Here's a basic example of how you'd create a custom error message to handle this error. This
requires 1) a policy that defines the custom message, and 2) a FaultRule that executes the policy
when the proxy goes into an error state.
1. Create a policy
that defines the custom message
First, create a policy that defines the custom error message. You can use any type of policy,
such as an AssignMessage policy , that can set a payload and optional HTTP headers such as
the status code.
The AssignMessage policy is ideal for this. It lets you control message payload, set a
different HTTP status code and add HTTP headers.
You don't need to attach the policy to a flow; just create it, as described in
Create the policy .
Following is an example AssignMessage policy that:
Returns a JSON message.
Sets an HTTP status code ( 911 , which is an obvious non-existent status code simply to
illustrate the flexibility you have). The status code appears in the HTTP header.
Creates and populates a new HTTP header called invalidKey .
< AssignMessage async = "false" continueOnError = "false" enabled = "true" name = " invalid-key-message " >
< DisplayName>Invalid key message < / DisplayName >
< Set >
< Payload contentType = "application/json" > { "Citizen" : "Where's your API key? I don't see it as a query parameter" } < / Payload >
< StatusCode>911 < / StatusCode >
< / Set >
< Add >
< Headers >
< Header name = "invalidKey" > Invalid API key !</ Header >
< / Headers >
< / Add >
< IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true < / IgnoreUnresolvedVariables >
< AssignTo createNew = "false" transport = "http" type = "request" / >
< / AssignMessage >
When this policy is executed, the response to the client app will look like the following.
Compare it to the default response shown earlier.
HTTP / 1.1 911 Rejected by API Key Emergency Services
Date : Wed, 20 Jul 2016 18:42:36 GMT
Content-Type : application/json
Content-Length : 35
Connection : keep-alive
invalidKey : Invalid API key!
Server : Apigee Router
* Co nne c t io n # 0 t o hos t myorg - test .apigee. net le ft i nta c t
{ "Citizen" : "Where's your API key? I don't see it as a query parameter." }
Yes, it's a little silly, but it shows you what's possible. At least now the developer
receiving the message knows they forgot to include an API key as a query parameter.
But how does this policy get executed? The next section shows you.
2. Create the
<FaultRule> that will trigger the policy
In the <ProxyEndpoint> or <TargetEndpoint> sections of
the proxy configuration, you'll add a <FaultRules> XML block that contains one
or more individual <FaultRule> sections. Each FaultRule represents a different
error you want to handle. In this simple example, we'll use only one FaultRule to show you what
it's composed of.
You should also add a <DefaultFaultRule> to provide a custom general error
message if none of your FaultRules is executed.
Example
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
...
<FaultRules>
<FaultRule name="invalid_key_rule">
<Step>
<Name> invalid-key-message </Name>
</Step>
<Condition>(fault.name = "FailedToResolveAPIKey")</Condition>
</FaultRule>
</FaultRules>
< DefaultFaultRule name="default-fault">
<Step>
<Name>Default-message</Name>
</Step>
</DefaultFaultRule>
Key points:
The FaultRules are defined in the ProxyEndpoint. This is important. More on putting
FaultRules in the ProxyEndpoint vs. TargetEndpoint later.
<Name> : The name of the policy to execute. The name
comes from the policy's name attribute on the parent element, as shown in the
policy example earlier.
<Condition> : Apigee evaluates the condition and
executes the policy only if the condition is true. If there are multiple FaultRules that
evaluate to true, Apigee executes the first one that is true. ( Important : The
order in which the FaultRules are evaluated, top to bottom or bottom to top, differs between
the TargetEndpoint and ProxyEndpoint, as described in the Multiple
FaultRules and execution logic section.) If you don't include a condition, the FaultRule
is automatically true. But that's not a best practice. Each FaultRule should have its own
condition.
Note: As you'll see later, Steps can have their own inner
conditions that determine whether or not a policy gets executed. (More on that in the
Multiple FaultRules and execution logic section.) But Step
conditions have nothing to do with whether or not a FaultRule gets executed. Apigee
looks at only the outer FaultRule conditions to determine which FaultRule gets executed.
<DefaultFaultRule> : If no custom FaultRule is
executed, the <DefaultFaultRule> is executed, sending a more generic
custom message instead of the cryptic default Apigee-generated message. A
<DefaultFaultRule> can also have a <Condition> , but in
most cases you won't include one, because you want it to execute no matter what as a last
resort.
The DefaultFaultRule is typically used to return a generic error message for any
unexpected error. An example would be a message that contains contact information for
technical support. This default response serves the dual purpose of providing
developer-friendly information while also obfuscating backend URLs or other information that
might be used to compromise the system.
Multiple FaultRules and execution logic
Sample: Learn by doing!
If you want to dive in and get your hands dirty with an easy-to-use sample that illustrates
multiple FaultRules, check out this
Learn by doing example in the Apigee GitHub samples. Just clone the repository and
follow the instructions in that topic. You can always come back to this section to get more
details on how it all works.
In the Simple fault handling example section, we used a simple example
of a single FaultRule and condition. In a real-world API project, with all the possible errors
that can occur, you're likely to have multiple FaultRules and a DefaultFaultRule in both your
<ProxyEndpoint> and <TargetEndpoint> . Ultimately, though,
only one FaultRule is executed when an API proxy goes into an error state.
This section describes the logic Apigee uses in handling FaultRules, from how it arrives at a
single FaultRule to execute to how inner Step conditions are handled when their FaultRule is
triggered. This section also provides guidance on when to define FaultRules in the
<ProxyEndpoint> vs. the <TargetEndpoint> , and describes the
relationship between FaultRules and the RaiseFault policy .
FaultRules execution
Note: Outer and inner conditions
In this topic we refer to outer and inner conditions. You can also think of them as
FaultRule and Step conditions. The difference is important. Following is an example of a
FaultRule that has an outer FaultRule condition and an inner step condition. We'll discuss the
differences in this section.
<FaultRule name="over_quota">
<Step>
<Name>developer-over-quota-fault</Name>
<!-- Inner (Step) condition. Only gets executed if
the FaultRule is executed. -->
<Condition>(ratelimit.developer-quota-policy.exceed.count GreaterThan "0")</Condition>
</Step>
<!-- Outer (FaultRule) condition. Apigee evaluates this
to determine whether or not to execute
the FaultRule. -->
<Condition>(fault.name = "QuotaViolation")</Condition>
</FaultRule>
In brief, here's the logic Apigee uses when an API proxy goes into an error state. Note that
there is a slight difference between FaultRules evaluation in the ProxyEndpoint versus the
TargetEndpoint.
Apigee evaluates the FaultRules in either the ProxyEndpoint or TargetEndpoint, depending on
where the error occurred:
ProxyEndpoint - Apigee starts with the bottom
<FaultRule> in the configuration XML and works its way up, evaluating
the <Condition> of each <FaultRule> (the outer
condition, not the inner <Step> conditions).
TargetEndpoint - Apigee starts with the top
<FaultRule> in the configuration XML and works its way down, evaluating
the <Condition> of each <FaultRule> (the outer
condition, not the inner <Step> conditions).
Executes the first FaultRule whose condition is true. If a FaultRule has
no condition, it's true by default.
When a FaultRule is executed, all Steps inside the FaultRule are evaluated in order,
top to bottom in the XML configuration. Steps without conditions are automatically executed
(the policies are executed), and Steps that have a <Condition> that
evaluates to are executed (conditions that evaluate to code are not
executed).
If a FaultRule is executed, but no steps in the FaultRule are executed (because their
conditions evaluate to code ), the Apigee-generated default error message is returned to
the client app. The <DefaultFaultRule> is not executed,
because Apigee has already executed its one FaultRule.
Note: The exception to this is if the <DefaultFaultRule> has
the child element <AlwaysEnforce>true</AlwaysEnforce> , which
executes the DefaultFaultRule even if a FaultRule was executed.
However, there's one instance where this isn't the case. If a FaultRule other than
the DefaultFaultRule invokes a RaiseFault policy , the DefaultFaultRule does not
execute, even if the <AlwaysEnforce> element in
the <DefaultFaultRule> tag is true.
If no FaultRule is executed, Apigee executes the <DefaultFaultRule> , if
present.
Following are examples with inline comments.
ProxyEndpoint execution
Evaluation of ProxyEndpoint FaultRules is bottom to top, so start reading at the last
FaultRule in the following sample and work your way up. Look at the DefaultFaultRule last.
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
...
<FaultRules>
<!-- 3. This FaultRule is automatically TRUE, because there's no outer
condition. But because the FaultRule just below this got
executed (bottom-to-top evaluation in a ProxyEndpoint), Apigee
doesn't even evaluate this FaultRule.
Note that it's not a best practice to have a FaultRule without
an outer condition, which automatically makes the FaultRule true. -->
<FaultRule name="random-error-message">
<Step>
<Name>Random-fault</Name>
</Step>
</FaultRule>
<!-- 2. Let's say this fault is TRUE. The Quota policy threw a QuotaViolation
error. This is the first FaultRule to be TRUE, so it's executed.
Now the Steps are evaluated, and for the ones whose conditions
evaluate to TRUE, their policies are executed. Steps without
conditions are automatically true. -->
<FaultRule name="over_quota">
<Step>
<Name>developer-over-quota-fault</Name>
<Condition>(ratelimit.developer-quota-policy.exceed.count GreaterThan "0")</Condition>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>global-over-quota-fault</Name>
<Condition>(ratelimit.global-quota-policy.exceed.count GreaterThan "0")</Condition>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>log-error-message</Name>
</Step>
<Condition>(fault.name = "QuotaViolation")</Condition>
</FaultRule>
<!-- 1. Because this is the ProxyEndpoint, Apigee looks at this FaultRule
first. But let's say this FaultRule is FALSE. A policy did not
throw a FailedToResolveAPIKey error. Apigee moves UP to check
the next FaultRule. -->
<FaultRule name="invalid_key_rule">
<Step>
<Name>invalid-key-message</Name>
</Step>
<Condition>(fault.name = "FailedToResolveAPIKey")</Condition>
</FaultRule>
</FaultRules>
<!-- If no <FaultRule> is executed, the <DefaultFaultRule> is executed.
If a FaultRule is executed, but none of its Steps are executed,
The DefaultFaultRule is not executed (because Apigee has already
executed its one FaultRule). -->
<DefaultFaultRule name="default-fault">
<Step>
<Name>Default-message</Name>
</Step>
</DefaultFaultRule>
TargetEndpoint execution
Evaluation of TargetEndpoint FaultRules is top to bottom, so start reading at the first
FaultRule in the following sample and work your way down. Look at the DefaultFaultRule last.
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
...
<FaultRules>
<!-- 1. Because this is the TargetEndpoint, Apigee looks at this FaultRule
first. Let's say this FaultRule is FALSE.
A policy did not throw a FailedToResolveAPIKey error.
Apigee moves down to the next FaultRule. -->
<FaultRule name="invalid_key_rule">
<Step>
<Name>invalid-key-message</Name>
</Step>
<Condition>(fault.name = "FailedToResolveAPIKey")</Condition>
</FaultRule>
<!-- 2. Let's say this fault is TRUE. The Quota policy threw a QuotaViolation
error. This is the first FaultRule to be TRUE, so it's executed.
Now the Steps are evaluated, and for the ones whose conditions
evaluate to TRUE, their policies are executed. Steps without
conditions are automatically true. -->
<FaultRule name="over_quota">
<Step>
<Name>developer-over-quota-fault</Name>
<Condition>(ratelimit.developer-quota-policy.exceed.count GreaterThan "0")</Condition>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>global-over-quota-fault</Name>
<Condition>(ratelimit.global-quota-policy.exceed.count GreaterThan "0")</Condition>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>log-error-message</Name>
</Step>
<Condition>(fault.name = "QuotaViolation")</Condition>
</FaultRule>
<!-- 3. This FaultRule is automatically TRUE, because there's no outer
condition. But because the FaultRule just above this got
executed (top-to-bottom evaluation in a TargetEndpoint), Apigee
doesn't even evaluate this FaultRule.
Note that it's not a best practice to have a FaultRule without
an outer condition, which automatically makes the FaultRule true. -->
<FaultRule name="random-error-message">
<Step>
<Name>Random-fault</Name>
</Step>
</FaultRule>
</FaultRules>
<!-- If no <FaultRule> is executed, the <DefaultFaultRule> is executed.
If a FaultRule is executed, but none of its Steps are executed,
The DefaultFaultRule is not executed (because Apigee has already
executed its one FaultRule). -->
<DefaultFaultRule name="default-fault">
<Step>
<Name>Default-message</Name>
</Step>
</DefaultFaultRule>
Fault rule order
As you can see in the previous example, the order in which you put your FaultRules is
important depending on whether the error occurs in the ProxyEndpoint versus the
TargetEndpoint.
For example:
ProxyEndpoint order
TargetEndpoint order
In the following example, since evaluation is bottom to top, FaultRule 3 is executed,
which means FaultRules 2 and 1 aren't evaluated.
5. FaultRule 1: FALSE
4. FaultRule 2: TRUE
3. FaultRule 3: TRUE
2. FaultRule 4: FALSE
1. FaultRule 5: FALSE
In the following example, since evaluation is top to bottom, FaultRule 2 is executed,
which means FaultRules 3, 4, and 5 aren't evaluated.
1. FaultRule 1: FALSE
2. FaultRule 2: TRUE
3. FaultRule 3: TRUE
4. FaultRule 4: FALSE
5. FaultRule 5: FALSE
Policies to include
You can execute any policies from a FaultRule by putting them in Steps. For example, you can
execute an AssignMessage policy to format a response to the client app, then log a message
with the MessageLogging policy . Policies are executed in the order you put them
(top to bottom in the XML).
Fault rules are triggered ONLY in an error state (about continueOnError)
The heading may seem like we're repeating ourselves, but there's one particular nuance to be
aware of with regard to a proxy error causing an API proxy to enter an error state—or
rather, not entering an error state: the continueOnError attribute on a
policy.
To recap: An API proxy evaluates <FaultRules> and
<DefaultFaultRule> only if the proxy has entered an error state. That
means that even if a FaultRule condition evaluates to true, it won't get triggered if the proxy
isn't in an error state.
However, here's an example of an error occurring and the proxy not entering an error state. On
any policy, you can set an attribute on the parent element called continueOnError .
That attribute is very important with regard to fault handling, because it determines whether or
not the proxy enters an error state if the policy fails. In most cases, you'll want to keep the
default continueOnError="false" , which puts the proxy in an error state if the
policy fails, and your custom error handling will get triggered. However, if
continueOnError="true" (for example, if you don't want the failure of a Service
Callout to stop the proxy execution), the proxy will not go into an error state if that
policy fails, and the proxy won't look at your FaultRules.
For information on logging errors when continueOnError="true" , see Handling policy faults within the current flow .
Where
to define FaultRules: ProxyEndpoint or TargetEndpoint
When an API proxy experiences an error, the error occurs either in the
<ProxyEndpoint> (request from or response to client app) or in the
<TargetEndpoint> (request to or response from target service). Wherever that
error occurs is where Apigee looks for FaultRules.
For example, if a target server isn't available (HTTP status code 503 ), the API proxy would go
into an error state in the <TargetEndpoint> response, and the normal API proxy
flow wouldn't continue to the <ProxyEndpoint> . If you have FaultRules defined
only in the <ProxyEndpoint> , they won't handle that error.
Here's another example. If a RaiseFault policy on the <ProxyEndpoint>
response triggers an error, a FaultRule in the <TargetEndpoint> won't get
executed.
Note: Remember, as mentioned in the FaultRules execution
section, FaultRules are evaluated in the following order. The first FaultRule whose outer
condition evaluates to true is executed.
ProxyEndpoint : Bottom up, last FaultRule in the XML configuration
first.
TargetEndpoint : Top down, first FaultRule in the XML configuration
first.
FaultRules vs. the RaiseFault policy
Fault rules and the RaiseFault policy may on the surface sound like alternative ways to
accomplish fault handling; and in some ways that's true. But they also work together. This
section explains the relationship between the two. Understanding this relationship should help
you design your fault handling, especially if you want to use both.
In brief:
Fault rules are always evaluated when an API proxy enters an error
state.
The RaiseFault policy is a way of putting an API proxy in an error state
when an error wouldn't have otherwise occurred.
For example, if you want to throw an error if the HTTP status code in the response from
the target service is greater than 200 , you add a RaiseFault policy in your response
flow. It would look something like this:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<PreFlow name="PreFlow">
...
<Response>
<Step>
<Name>Raise-Fault-1</Name>
<!-- If the condition is true, the Raise-Fault-1 policy gets executed -->
<Condition>(response.status.code GreaterThan "200")</Condition>
</Step>
</Response>
The RaiseFault policy also sends an error message to the client app.
What happens when a RaiseFault policy triggers an error, which puts the proxy in an error
state, which potentially executes a FaultRule? Here's where things can get a little tricky. If
the RaiseFault policy returns an error message and a FaultRule gets triggered and
returns an error message, what gets returned to the client app?
Since the FaultRule or DefaultFaultRule is executed after the RaiseFault policy, the
FaultRule response data wins.
The RaiseFault policy response data (status code or message payload) is
used if that data is not set by the FaultRule or DefaultFaultRule.
If both the RaiseFault policy and FaultRule add custom HTTP headers, both are included in
the response. Duplicate header names create a header with multiple values.
Here's an example of what's set by a RaiseFault policy and a FaultRule, and what gets
returned to the client app. The samples are designed for brevity, not for best practices.
Client app receives :
Status Code : 468
Payload : { "Whoa" : "Sorry." }
Header :
errorNote : woops , gremlins
<- Fault rules policy sets this :
Status Code : [ none ]
Payload : { "Whoa" : "Sorry." }
Header :
errorNote : gremlins
<- RaiseFault policy sets this :
Status Code : 468
Payload : {"DOH!":"Try again."}
Header :
errorNote: woops
Note: If the <DefaultFaultRule> has the child
element <AlwaysEnforce>true</AlwaysEnforce> , the DefaultFaultRule is
always executed, even if another FaultRule was executed as well. Any payload and/or headers set
by a policy in the DefaultFaultRule get returned to the client, since it's the last to
execute.
Building conditions
Conditions are the key to FaultRule execution. You create FaultRule conditions the same way
you do for other conditions in Apigee, such as for conditional flows or RaiseFault conditions.
To put the rest of this section in context, here's a sample fault rule that has an outer
FaultRule condition and an inner Step condition.
<FaultRule name="invalid_key_rule">
<Step>
<Name>invalid-key-message</Name>
<Condition> oauthV2.Verify-API-Key-1.failed = true</Condition>
</Step>
<Condition> fault.name = "FailedToResolveAPIKey"</Condition>
</FaultRule>
Variables specific to policy
errors
The fault.name and {policy_namespace}.{policy_name}.failed variables
are available when a policy throws an error.
fault.name
When a policy fails, catch the error in a condition using the fault.name
variable. For example:
<Condition> fault.name = "policy_error_name"</Condition>
The error name appears in the default error message. For example, in the following, the fault
name is FailedToResolveAPIKey . In this case, a flow variable called
fault.name is set to the value FailedToResolveAPIKey .
{ "fault" :{ "faultstring" : "Failed to resolve API Key variable request.queryparam.apikey" , "detail" :{ "errorcode" : "steps.oauth.v2. FailedToResolveAPIKey " }}}
So the condition would look like this:
<Condition> fault.name = "FailedToResolveAPIKey"</Condition>
See the Policy error reference for a list of policy errors.
{policy_namespace}.{policy_name}.failed
The *.failed variable is available when a policy fails. Following are
examples of *.failed variables for different policies.
For policy namespaces, see the flow variables in each policy reference topic.
RaiseFault policy : raisefault.failed
(same for all RaiseFault policies)
VerifyAPIKey policy : oauthV2.{policy_name}.failed , for
example, oauthV2.Verify-API-Key-1.failed
Quota policy and SpikeArrest policy :
ratelimit.{policy_name}.failed , for example,
ratelimit.Quota-1.failed
Other available variables
When an API proxy goes into an error state, the only available variables for use in conditions
are:
The variables of the policy that failed.
The HTTP message variables that exist at the point of failure. For example, if an error is
thrown in the response, a FaultRule in the <TargetEndpoint> could use HTTP
data response.status.code , message.content ,
error.content , and so on. Or if a Quota policy failed, you could use the
variable
ratelimit.{quota_policy_name}.exceed.count . Use the Debug tool and the
Policy reference to help you figure out which variables and HTTP data are available.

Best practices for fault handling
Fault handling is a major architectural design task for API proxy development. It's important
to take the time to figure out how and when you're going to handle errors, determine what error
messages will say, and design error message formats. After (or as) you figure those things out,
then use these best practices to help you with your fault handling implementation.
Here are some best practices in designing and building fault handling:
In FaultRules, you can specify any type of policy. The most common pattern is to use
the AssignMessage policy to set specific items in the pending error response.
You can also use AssignMessage to set variables used for other purposes, for example,
for variables referenced by logging policies that execute in the PostClientFlow, or in FlowHooks.
Also consider logging a message, for example with the MessageLogging policy or the
ServiceCallout policy , if you want to log specific errors in specific fault conditions.
Do not specify RaiseFault policies as Steps within a FaultRule. It is better to use
AssignMessage policies to set or alter message elements, including the payload, headers,
or status code.
For each FaultRule, or for all but the last-evaluated FaultRule,
provide an outer <Condition> attached as a child of the
<FaultRule> element. The execution condition for a FaultRule with no explicit
Condition specified, will implicitly evaluate to true . A <Condition>
element attached as a child of a <Step> element
is not used to determine whether the execution condition for the FaultRule evaluates to true
or false . Step conditions are evaluated only after Apigee executes the FaultRule containing them.
In a FaultRule, it's common to have multiple Steps with AssignMessage (or other) policies,
each with a Step condition.
To handle errors in multiple policies of the same type (for example, multiple Quota
policies), create one FaultRule per policy error you're likely to receive, and then distinguish
between separate errors with Conditions attached to Steps. For example,
create a FaultRule to handle an error in Quota policies, such as
QuotaViolation , and a separate FaultRule for InvalidApiKey .
(See the Policy error reference for
policy errors. As you discover additional errors that need to be handled, you can go back
later and add them to your FaultRules. It's okay to be iterative, though it does require
proxy redeployment.) This approach allows you to catch the same type of error no matter which
policy throws it, which makes your FaultRules XML efficient.
The inner Step conditions give you more fine-grained control. For example,
if you're enforcing both individual developer quota and global quota with two policies in
your request flow, set your outer FaultRule condition to get triggered on the
QuotaViolation error (which is thrown when quota goes over in either case). Then
set Step conditions to evaluate the specific exceed.count variables in both of your quota
policies. Only the relevant error is sent to the client (developer quota overage or global
quota overage). Here's an example of this configuration:
<FaultRule name="over_quota">
<!-- This condition catches a QuotaViolation in *any* Quota policy -->
<Condition>fault.name = "QuotaViolation"</Condition>
<Step>
<Name>AM-developer-over-quota-fault</Name>
<Condition>ratelimit.developer-quota-policy.exceed.count GreaterThan 0</Condition>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>AM-global-over-quota-fault</Name>
<Condition>ratelimit.global-quota-policy.exceed.count GreaterThan 0</Condition>
</Step>
</FaultRule>
For another example, see this discussion on Policy fault handling .
To handle errors when you're using a single policy of one type, consider a single fault
rule that gets executed when that one policy fails, and include multiple steps that map to
each possible error. This keeps your XML simpler by using a single FaultRule rather than
multiple FaultRules (one for each error type). For example, you can specify that different
AssignMessage policy steps execute in different conditions, like this:
<FaultRule name="raise-fault-3">
<!-- This condition catches *any* error in the Verify-API-Key-1 policy. -->
<Condition>oauthV2.Verify-API-Key-1.failed = "true"</Condition>
<!-- This first step always executes, which handles errors you haven't mapped with inner conditions. -->
<Step>
<Name>AM-Generic-Key-Fault</Name>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>AM-API-Key-NotFound</Name>
<Condition>fault.name = "FailedToResolveAPIKey"</Condition>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>AM-API-Key-Invalid</Name>
<Condition>fault.name = "InvalidApiKey"</Condition>
</Step>
</FaultRule>
Note: When using this pattern, consider including one step that
will always execute (by not providing a condition for it). Why? Because it will run and
provide a message for errors that you haven't mapped with inner conditions. Put this
unconditional step first . That way, any specific error caught in a later step will
take precedence in the response.
Add FaultRules where the errors will occur (client side <ProxyEndpoint>
or target side <TargetEndpoint> ). Include FaultRules for each policy that
appears in each location.
When using RaiseFault policies in conjunction with FaultRules, coordinate the response
data that's sent back when both the RaiseFault policy and a FaultRule return data. For
example, if you have a RaiseFault policy that sets the HTTP status code, don't also configure an
AssignMessage Step within a FaultRule that resets
the status code. The worst that can happen is that the default status code gets returned to the
client app.
The <DefaultFaultRule> element complements the <FaultRules>
element to give you more control over policies that the proxy executes when it is handling a
fault state. If you specify a <DefaultFaultRule> , it will execute if either or
both of the following is true:
No other FaultRule has executed. A special case here is if there is
no <FaultRules> element configured at all.
If the <AlwaysEnforce> child element of <DefaultFaultRule> is true.
You can also specify a <Condition> element on a <DefaultFaultRule> .
You might want to do this to exclude its execution based on some state of the request or pending error
message, for example if a specific header is present or missing.
Use a <DefaultFaultRule> with
<AlwaysEnforce> set to true , if you have
one or more policies that you want the proxy to always perform,
irrespective of whether a prior FaultRule has executed. One possible
scenario: suppose you want to inject a header into the response in
all cases, whether the proxy request resulted in a fault or not, and
whether or not the fault had been previously handled. Then you would
attach an appropriate AssignMessage policy in the
<PostFlow> / <Response> section, and
also attach the same policy in the <DefaultFaultRule>
with <AlwaysEnforce> set to true .
Pattern for
centralized, reusable fault handling
An
error-handling pattern for Apigee proxies describes a pattern for centralized fault handling
without code duplication.
Creating FaultRules
To add a FaultRule you need to edit the XML configuration of the ProxyEndpoint or
TargetEndpoint. You can use the Apigee UI to make this edit in the Code pane of the
Develop view for an API proxy, or edit the XML file that defines the ProxyEndpoint or
TargetEndpoint.
If you create FaultRules in the Apigee UI, first create the policies you want to execute,
then add them to the FaultRule configuration. (You'll get an error in the UI if you try to save a
FaultRule that references a policy that hasn't been created yet.)
Adding policies to a FaultRule
While you can put any policy in the FaultRule, you commonly use the
AssignMessage policy to generates a custom response message for an error condition.
AssignMessage enables you to configure an HTTP response with payload, HTTP status code, and headers.
Note: A policy used in a FaultRule is typically not used in the normal flow
pipeline. Therefore, when using the Apigee UI to create a policy for a FaultRule, select the
plus sign, + , next to Policies in the UI to add the policy:
The example below shows a typical AssignMessage policy configuration:
< AssignMessage name = "AM-Invalid-Key" >
< Set >
< Payload contentType = "text/plain" > That is an error .</ Payload >
< StatusCode>401 < / StatusCode >
< / Set >
< IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true < / IgnoreUnresolvedVariables >
< / AssignMessage >
Notice that it does not specify an <AssignTo> element. This means it
will assign to the ambient message, depending on where the policy is attached.
You can now use this policy in your FaultRule. Notice how you reference the AssignMessage
policy by name in the FaultRule:
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
...
<FaultRules>
<FaultRule name="invalid_key_rule">
<Step>
<Name>AM-Invalid-Key</Name>
</Step>
<Condition>fault.name = "InvalidApiKey"</Condition>
</FaultRule>
</FaultRules>
</ProxyEndpoint>
When you deploy the configuration above, the API proxy will execute the AssignMessage policy
called AM-Invalid-Key whenever an app presents an invalid API key.
You can execute multiple policies in a FaultRule, as the following example shows:
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
...
<FaultRules>
<FaultRule name="invalid_key_rule">
<Step>
<Name>AM-Invalid-Key</Name>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>policy2</Name>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>policy3</Name>
</Step>
<Condition>fault.name = "InvalidApiKey"</Condition>
</FaultRule>
</FaultRules>
</ProxyEndpoint>
The policies execute in the order defined. For example, you can use the
MessageLogging policy , the ExtractVariables policy , the
AssignMessage policy , or any other policy in the
FaultRule. Note that processing of the FaultRule stops immediately if either of these situations
occur:
Any policy in the FaultRule causes an error
Any of the policies in the FaultRule is of type RaiseFault
Defining the
custom error message returned from a FaultRule
As a best practice, you should define clear error responses from your
APIs. In that way, you deliver consistent and helpful information to your clients.
The following AssignMessage policy example uses the <Payload> and
<StatusCode> tags to define the custom
error response sent back to the client on an InvalidApiKey error (see previous FaultRules
example).
< AssignMessage name = "AM-Invalid-Key" >
< Set >
< Payload contentType = "text/plain" > You have attempted to access a resource without the correct authorization .
Contact support at support @ mycompany . com .</ Payload >
< StatusCode>401 < / StatusCode >
< / Set >
< IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true < / IgnoreUnresolvedVariables >
< / AssignMessage >
This response includes:
The payload containing the error message and an email address for contacting support.
The HTTP status code returned in the response.
Creating a DefaultFaultRule
A DefaultFaultRule acts as an exception handler for any error that is not explicitly handled by
another FaultRule. If the conditions for all FaultRules do not match the error, then the
DefaultFaultRule handles the error. Enable default fault handling by adding the
<DefaultFaultRule> tag as a child element of a ProxyEndpoint or a
TargetEndpoint.
For example, the TargetEndpoint configuration below defines a DefaultFaultRule that invokes a
policy named AM-Return-Generic-Error :
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
...
<FaultRules>
...
</FaultRules>
<DefaultFaultRule name="fault-rule">
<Step>
<Name>AM-Return-Generic-Error</Name>
</Step>
</DefaultFaultRule>
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<URL>https://mytarget.example.net</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
The DefaultFaultRule is typically used to return a generic error message for any unexpected
error, such as a message that contains contact information for technical support. This default
response serves the dual purpose of providing developer-friendly information while also
obfuscating backend URLs or other information that might be used to compromise the system.
For example, you define the following AssignMessage policy to return a generic error:
< AssignMessage name = "AM-Return-Generic-Error" >
< Set >
< Payload type = "text/plain" > SERVICE UNAVAILABLE . PLEASE CONTACT SUPPORT : support @ company . com .</ Payload >
< / Set >
< / AssignMessage >
Include the <AlwaysEnforce> element in the
<DefaultFaultRule> tag to execute the DefaultFaultRule for every error, even
if another FaultRule has already been executed. The DefaultFaultRule is always the last FaultRule
to execute:
<DefaultFaultRule name="fault-rule">
<Step>
<Name>AM-Return-Generic-Error</Name>
</Step>
<AlwaysEnforce>true</AlwaysEnforce>
</DefaultFaultRule>
One use of the DefaultFaultRule is to determine the type of error that occurs when you
otherwise cannot determine it. For example, if your API proxy is failing due to an error that you
cannot determine, you can use the DefaultFaultRule to invoke the following AssignMessage policy. This
policy writes the fault.name value to a header named Unhandled-Fault
in the response:
<AssignMessage name="AM-Set-Fault-Header">
<Set>
<Headers>
<Header name="Unhandled-Fault">{fault.name}</Header>
</Headers>
</Set>
<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
</AssignMessage>
You can then view the header in the Debug tool or on the response to see what caused the
error.
Adding message logging to the
PostClientFlow
The PostClientFlow is the only flow that executes after the proxy enters the error
state. Only the MessageLogging policy can be attached to this flow, which is executed
after the response is sent
back to the client. Although attaching the MessageLogging policy to this flow is
technically not
error handling, you can use it to log information in the event of an error. Because it is
executed regardless of whether the proxy succeeded or failed, you can put Message Logging
policies in the PostClientFlow and be guaranteed that they always execute.
Handling policy faults within the current flow
The examples shown so far all use a FaultRule on the ProxyEndpoint or TargetEndpoint to handle
any policy errors as part of the error state. That is because the default value of the
continueOnError element of a policy is false , meaning that when an
error occurs in a policy, control is directed to the error state. Once in the error state, you
cannot return control back to the normal pipeline and you typically return some form of error
message to the calling app.
However, if you set the continueOnError element to true for a
policy, control stays in the current flow and the next policy in the pipeline executes after the
policy that caused the error. The advantage to handling the error in the current flow is that you
might have a way to recover from the error to complete processing of the request.
Shown below is a VerifyAPIKey policy named verify-api-key with the
continueOnError element set to true:
<VerifyAPIKey continueOnError="true" name="verify-api-key">
<DisplayName>Verify API Key</DisplayName>
<APIKey ref="request.queryparam.apikey"/>
</VerifyAPIKey>
If the API key is missing or invalid, then the VerifyAPIKey policy sets the
oauthV2.verify-api-key.failed variable to true , but processing
continues in the current flow.
You then add VerifyAPIKey policy as a step in the PreFlow of the ProxyEndpoint:
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
...
<PreFlow name="PreFlow">
<Request>
<Step>
<Name>verify-api-key</Name>
</Step>
<Step>
<Name>FaultInFlow</Name>
<Condition>oauthV2.verify-api-key.failed = "true"</Condition>
</Step>
</Request>
<Response/>
</PreFlow>
</ProxyEndpoint>
Notice how the next step in the PreFlow uses a condition to test for the existence of an
error. If an error occurred in the VerifyAPIKey policy, then the policy named
FaultInFlow policy executes. Otherwise, the FaultInFlow policy is
skipped. The FaultInFlow policy can do many things, such as logging the error,
attempting to fix the error, or performing some other action.
Triggering an error by using the RaiseFault
policy
You can use the RaiseFault policy at any time in a flow to trigger an error. When a
RaiseFault policy executes, it terminates the current flow and transfers control to the error
state.
One use of the RaiseFault policy is to test for a specific condition that another policy
might not detect. In the example above, you added a <Condition> tag to a
PreFlow <Step> tag that caused the policy FaultInFlow to execute
if the condition is met. If FaultInFlow is a RaiseFault policy, then control
transfers to the error state. Or, you might insert a RaiseFault policy in a flow to debug and
test your FaultRules.
When a RaiseFault policy triggers an error, you can use the following FaultRule and condition
to process it:
<FaultRule name="raisefault_rule">
<Step>
<Name>POLICY-NAME-HERE</Name>
</Step>
<Condition>fault.name = "RaiseFault"</Condition>
</FaultRule>
Note that the condition tests for a fault named RaiseFault . The RaiseFault
policy always sets the value of fault.name to RaiseFault . You can also
set custom variables within a RaiseFault policy. If you do that, then you can test those variables
within the Condition elements.
Custom handling of HTTP error codes
from the target server
The examples shown in the previous sections apply to errors created by policies. However you
can also create a custom response for transport-level errors, meaning HTTP errors returned from
the target server. To control the response from an HTTP error, configure a TargetEndpoint to
process HTTP response codes.
By default, Apigee treats HTTP response codes in the 1xx-3xx range as
success , and HTTP
response codes in the range 4xx-5xx as failure . That means any response from the backend
service with an HTTP response code 4xx-5xx automatically invokes the error state, which then
returns an error message directly to the requesting client.
You can create custom handlers for any HTTP response codes. For example, you might not want to
treat all HTTP response codes in the range 4xx-5xx as "failure" but only
5xx , or you might want
to return custom error messages for HTTP response codes 400 and 500 .
In the next example, you use the success.codes property to configure the
TargetEndpoint to treat HTTP response codes 400 and 500 as a success,
along with the default HTTP
codes. By treating those codes as a success, the TargetEndpoint takes over the processing of the
response message, instead of invoking the error state:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
...
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<Properties>
<Property name="success.codes">1xx,2xx,3xx,400,500</Property>
</Properties>
<URL>http://weather.yahooapis.com</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
As you can see in this example, you can use wildcards to set the success.codes property to a range of
values..
Setting the success.codes property overwrites
the default values. Therefore, if you want to add HTTP code 400 to the list of default success
codes, set this property as:
<Property name="success.codes">1xx,2xx,3xx,400</Property>
But, if you only want HTTP code 400 to be treated as a success code, set the property as:
<Property name="success.codes">400</Property>
You can now define custom handlers for HTTP response codes 400 and 500
to return a customized
response message to the requesting app. The following TargetEndpoint uses the policy named
ReturnError to handle HTTP 400 and 500 response codes:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
<PreFlow name="PreFlow">
<Request/>
<Response>
<Step>
<Name>ReturnError</Name>
<Condition>(response.status.code = 400) or (response.status.code = 500)</Condition>
</Step>
</Response>
</PreFlow>
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<Properties>
<Property name="success.codes">1xx,2xx,3xx,400,500</Property>
</Properties>
<URL>http://weather.yahooapis.com</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
This TargetEndpoint configuration causes the policy called ReturnError to handle
the response whenever the TargetEndpoint encounters an HTTP response code of
400 OR 500 .
