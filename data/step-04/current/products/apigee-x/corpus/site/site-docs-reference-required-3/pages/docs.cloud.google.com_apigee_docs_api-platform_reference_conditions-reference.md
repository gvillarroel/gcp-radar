Apigee Edge documentation.
Conditions enable API proxies to behave dynamically at runtime. Conditions define operations
on variables, which are evaluated by the Apigee processing pipeline. Conditional statements
are boolean and always evaluate to true or false .
Conditions overview
This section describes how and where to use conditional statements with Apigee. In addition, the
following sections describe the syntax:
Operators
Operands
Literals
Tip: For a tutorial-like topic that explains how to use
pattern matching in conditional statements, see Pattern matching with
conditionals .
Structure of conditional statements
The basic structure of a conditional statement is:
< Condition> variable . name operator " value " < / Condition >
For example:
<Condition>request.verb = "GET"</Condition>
You can combine conditions with AND to enforce more than one at a time. For example, the
following conditions evaluate to true only if the URI of the request matches
/statuses and the HTTP verb of the request is
GET :
<Condition>(proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/statuses") and (request.verb = "GET")</Condition>
Where you can use conditional statements
You can use conditions to control behavior in the following:
Policy execution
Flow execution
Target endpoint route selection
Policy execution
Using conditional statements, you can control the enforcement of policies. A common use case
is conditional transformation of response messages, based on HTTP header or message content.
The following example conditionally transforms XML to JSON based on the Accept
header:
<Step>
<Condition>request.header.accept = "application/json"</Condition>
<Name>XMLToJSON</Name>
</Step>
Flow execution
Using conditional statements, you can control the execution of named flows in ProxyEndpoints
and TargetEndpoints . Note that only named flows can be executed conditionally. Preflows and
postflows (both request and response) on ProxyEndpoints and TargetEndpoints execute for every
transaction, and thus provide unconditional failsafe capabilities.
For example, to execute a conditional request flow based on the HTTP verb of the request
message, and conditional response flow based on a (potential) HTTP status code representing an
error:
<Flow name="GetRequests">
<Condition>request.verb = "GET"</Condition>
<Request>
<Step>
<Condition>request.path MatchesPath "/statuses/**"</Condition>
<Name>StatusesRequestPolicy</Name>
</Step>
</Request>
<Response>
<Step>
<Condition>(response.status.code = 503) or (response.status.code = 400)</Condition>
<Name>MaintenancePolicy</Name>
</Step>
</Response>
</Flow>
Target endpoint route selection
Using conditional statements, you can control the target endpoint invoked by proxy endpoint
configuration. A route rule forwards a request to a particular target endpoint. When more than
one target endpoint is available, the route rule is evaluated for its condition and, if true, the
request is forwarded to the named target endpoint.
For example, to conditionally route messages to designated target endpoints based on
Content-Type :
<RouteRule name="default">
<!--this routing executes if the header indicates that this is an XML call. If true, the call is routed to the endpoint XMLTargetEndpoint-->
<Condition>request.header.Content-Type = "text/xml"</Condition>
<TargetEndpoint>XmlTargetEndpoint</TargetEndpoint>
</RouteRule>
See Flow variables and
conditions for more information.
Path expressions
Path expressions are used for matching URI paths, using * to represent a single path element
and ** to represent multiple URI levels. Curly braces {name} can also be
used to match a single path element and provide clarity to the reader. The variable name is only
only used for clarity and does not populate the matched value in a flow variable.
For example:
Pattern
Sample URI paths matched
/*/a/
/x/a/ or /y/a/
/*/a/*
/x/a/b or /y/a/foo
/*/a/**
/x/a/b/c/d
/*/a/{reader}/feed/
/x/a/b/feed/ or /y/a/foo/feed/
/a/**/feed/**
/a/b/feed/rss/1234
% is treated as an escape character. The
pattern %{user%} matches {user} but not
user .
Variables
You can use both built-in flow variables and custom variables in conditional statements.
For more information, see:
Flow variables reference : A complete list of the built-in variables
ExtractVariables policy : Instructions on setting custom variables
Operators
When using operators, observe the following restrictions:
Operators cannot be used as variable names.
A space character is required before and after an operator.
To include an operator in a variable, a variable name must be enclosed in single quotes.
For example, 'request.header.help!me' .
Arithmetic operators ( + * - / % ) are not supported.
Java
precedence is used for operators.
Apigee relies on regular expressions as implemented in
java.util.regex .
The following table lists the supported operators. You can use the symbol or the word in your
expressions:
Symbol
Word
Description
!
Not , not
Unary operator (takes a single input)
=
Equals , Is
Equals to (case sensitive)
!=
NotEquals , IsNot
Not equals (case sensitive)
:=
EqualsCaseInsensitive
Equals but is case insensitive
> or &gt;
GreaterThan
Greater than. If you use > when defining the condition in the Apigee UI, it is
converted to &gt;.
>= or &gt;=
GreaterThanOrEquals
Greater than or equal to. If you use >= when defining the condition in the Apigee UI,
it is converted to &gt;=.
&lt;
LesserThan
Lesser than. The Apigee UI does not support the literal <.
&lt;=
LesserThanOrEquals
Lesser than or equal to. The Apigee UI does not support the literal <=.
&&
And , and
And
||
Or
The Or operator is not case sensitive. For example, OR , Or , and or are all valid.
()
Groups an expression. The ( opens the expression and ) closes
it.
~~
JavaRegex
Matches a javax.util.regex compliant regular expression. The match is
case-sensitive. For examples, see
Pattern matching .
~
Matches , Like
Matches a glob-style pattern using the * wildcard character. The match is
case-sensitive. For examples, see
Pattern matching .
~/
MatchesPath , LikePath
Matches a path expression. The match is case-sensitive. For examples, see
Pattern matching .
=|
StartsWith
Matches the first characters of a string. The match is case-sensitive.
Operands
Apigee adapts operands to a common data type before comparing them. For example, if the
response status code is 404 , the expression response.status.code = "400" and the
response.status.code = 400 are equivalent.
For numeric operands, the data type is interpreted as integer unless the value is terminated
as follows:
f or F ( float , for example, 3.142f, 91.1F )
d or D ( double , for example, 3.142d, 100.123D )
l or L ( long , for example, 12321421312L )
In these cases, the system performs adaptations shown in the following table (where RHS refers
to the right side of the equation and LHS is the left side):
RHS LHS

of the operand shown:

Literals
In addition to string and numeric literals, you can use the following literals in
conditional statements:
null
true
false
For example:
request.header.host is null
flow.cachehit is true
Examples
< RouteRule name = "default" >
< Condition>request . header . content - type = "text/xml" < / Condition >
< TargetEndpoint>XmlTargetEndpoint < / TargetEndpoint >
< / RouteRule >
<Step>
<Condition>response.status.code = 503</Condition>
<Name>MaintenancePolicy</Name>
</Step>
<Flow name="GetRequests">
<Condition>response.verb="GET"</Condition>
<Request>
<Step>
<Condition>request.path ~ "/statuses/**"</Condition>
<Name>StatusesRequestPolicy</Name>
</Step>
</Request>
<Response>
<Step>
<Condition>(response.status.code = 503) or (response.status.code = 400)</Condition>
<Name>MaintenancePolicy</Name>
</Step>
</Response>
</Flow>
