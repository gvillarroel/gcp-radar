Apigee lets you easily and quickly build RESTful APIs that can be consumed by app
developers. You expose APIs on Apigee by building API proxies that act as managed 'facades' for
backend services. This topic discusses the relationship between APIs and API proxies on Apigee.
Video: Check out this short video for an introduction to API
proxies.
What is an API?
An API is an interface that makes it easy for one application to consume capabilities or
data from another application. By defining stable, simplified entry points to application logic
and data, APIs enable developers to easily access and reuse application logic built by other
developers. In the case of Web APIs , that logic and data is exposed over the network.
Since applications that consume APIs are sensitive to changes, APIs also imply a contract .
The contract provides some level of assurance that, over time, the API will change in a
predictable manner.
Apigee enables you to build APIs and if you have APIs already, expose them directly,
while adding a management and visibility layer. If you have HTTP enabled services, such as
SOA-based Web services, they can also be exposed as APIs via Apigee.
Apigee also enables you to build APIs by implementing applications hosted on the API Services
platform—with no backend service involved. You can build these applications in JavaScript and
Java.
Best practice: Apigee provides a wealth of information about APIs
and best practices for developing and consuming them.

or download the free eBook

What is an API proxy?
You expose APIs on Apigee by implementing API proxies . API proxies decouple the
app-facing API from your backend services, shielding those apps from backend code
changes. As you make backend changes to your services, apps continue to call the same API
without any interruption.
In an API proxy configuration, there are two types of endpoints:
ProxyEndpoint: Defines the way client apps consume your APIs. You
configure the ProxyEndpoint to define the URL of your API proxy. The proxy endpoint also
determines whether apps access the API proxy over HTTP or HTTPS. You usually attach
policies to the ProxyEndpoint to enforce security, quota checks, and other types of
access control and rate-limiting.
TargetEndpoint: Defines the way the API proxy interacts with your
backend services. You configure the TargetEndpoint to forward requests to the proper backend
service, including defining any security settings, HTTP or HTTPS protocol, and other connection
information. You can attach policies to the TargetEndpoint to ensure that response
messages are properly formatted for the app that made the initial request.
You can visualize API proxies as shown by the graphic below:
API proxy types
Apigee supports two proxy types:
Standard proxies include only
standard policies .
Standard proxies are suitable for lightweight API solutions and cannot be included in
API products .
Extensible proxies include at least one
extensible policy
or flow hook. Extensible proxies can include much more functionality than standard proxies.
How do you create an API proxy?
An API proxy consists of a bundle of XML configuration files and code (such as JavaScript and
Java). Apigee provides several ways for you to create API proxies, including:
Using the Apigee UI to define an API proxy in a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For more, see Build a simple
API proxy .
Creating XML files, along with any other supporting files, that define your API proxy and
then importing them into Apigee.
Using the Apigee API to create your API proxies by making a series of REST
requests to Apigee.
Develop locally using Apigee in VS Code and deploy as an archive.
For more information, see Overview of local development with Apigee
What is an API proxy revision?
Warning: Don't confuse the version of an API
(that is, the public interface) with the revision of an API proxy (that is, the internal
number associated with a configuration). The two numbers are unrelated, and the revision number
of an API proxy is totally opaque to apps that consume your API.
API proxy revisions provide a lightweight mechanism for managing the updates to the API proxy
configuration as you iterate. Revisions are sequentially numbered, enabling you to revert a change
by deploying a previous revision of your API proxy. Revisions let you deploy an API proxy
into a production environment while continuing to create new revisions of that API proxy in a
test environment. When you are ready, you can promote the higher revision of your API
proxy from test to prod.
What is a policy?
Apigee enables you to control API behavior without writing any code by using
policies .
A policy is like a module that implements a specific, limited management function as part of the
proxy request/response flow. Policies are designed to let you add common types of management
capabilities to an API easily and reliably. Policies provide features like security,
rate-limiting, transformation, and mediation capabilities, saving you from having to code and
maintain this functionality on your own.
