This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
API products bundle your APIs and make them available to app developers for consumption. For an
overview of API products, see What is
an API product?
Exploring the API products overview page
The Products overview page displays all of your API products and some details about each
one. From this page you can create a new API product, delete a product, or select one to view or edit.
To access the Products overview page in the Apigee in Cloud console:
Go to API products
The Products UI lets you perform the following common tasks:
Add an API product
Edit an API product
Search the list of API products
Delete an API product
These tasks are described in the following sections.
Create an API product
This section describes how to create an API product using the Apigee UIs.
To create an API product using the Apigee UI:
Go to the Apigee > Products overview page:
Go to API products
Click + Create . The product configuration page displays.
Configure the API product. The parts of the product configuration page include the following:
Product details : Basic information about the API product such as its
name, access level (private, public, or internal), and OAuth scopes.
Operations : Groups of API proxies, resource paths, and HTTP methods
supported by this API product. You can also define quotas limits for each
operation.
LLM Operations : Groups of API
proxies, models, resource paths, and HTTP methods for LLM operations supported by this
API product. You can also define token quota limits for each operation.
GraphQL Operations : Groups of API proxies, resource paths, and GraphQL operation
types
supported by this API product.
Supported GraphQL operation types include queries and mutations. You can specify one type
or the other, or both.
Just like for REST-based
API proxies, you can define quota limits on each operation.
gRPC Operations : Specify gRPC API proxies and
gRPC methods supported by this API product. Just
like for REST-based API proxies, you can define quota limits on operations.
Custom attributes : Key/value pairs that help you control API proxy
execution.
Each of these main parts are described in the sections below.
When you're done, click Save . Apigee creates the new API product. You can now
attach the product to a Developer app. See Controlling access to your APIs by registering apps .
For additional examples, see Secure an API by requiring API keys
and Secure an API with OAuth .
Product details
In the Product details section, enter basic information about your new API
product. The following table describes the fields in this section:
Field
Required?
Description
Name
Required
Defines the internal name of the API product. You use this value in calls to the Apigee
API that reference the API product. The value of the Name field can include
alphanumeric characters, spaces, and the following: _ - . # $ %
For example, My API Product or my-product .
Note: If you use the API product with Apigee
monetization, the product name must not contain any trailing spaces.
Note: You cannot change the Name of an API product
after you create it.
Display name
Required
Defines the name used in the Apigee UI for the API product. You can edit the display
name of the API product at any time.
The Display name can include special characters.
For example, <My> API Product!!! .
Description
Optional
A string that can help you remember the purpose or function of the API product. The
description can include special characters.
For example, The one where I let dev apps read but not write to the
"/accounts" endpoints.
Space
Optional
If your organization has Apigee Spaces enabled, you can associate the API product with a Space selected from the
list of available options. For more information, see Apigee Spaces overview .
Environment
Optional
Identifies which environments the API product allows access to. If no environments are
specified then all environments are allowed by the API Product.
The environments that you select in this field restrict access to API proxies based on
where they are deployed. For example, if API proxy A is deployed to both the
test and prod environments, but the API product only has the
test
environment selected, then an API call for the corresponding developer app only allows
access to API proxy A deployed in the test environment. For more information
on environments, see
About environments and environment groups .
Access
Required
The access level given to users of this API product. For details, see
Access
levels .
Automatically approve access requests
Optional (defaults to selected)
Enables automatic approval of key requests that come in for this API product from any
app. To require manual key approval, disable this option.
The default is selected, which means this API product automatically approves key
requests.
If you select manual key approval, you must approve key requests that come in from any
app that uses this API product. To manually approve keys:
UI: Select Publish > Apps , select the app and edit it.
Then click Approve .
API: Use the Developer app keys API .
For more information, see
Registering
apps and managing API keys .
API quota limit
Optional
Defines limits on the number of requests allowed for this API product. This value
applies to the sum of all operations' requests for this API product.
This value is superseded by more specific quota limits set on operations that you
define on the API product.
Entering a quota value does not automatically enforce restrictions on the number of
calls that can be made through the API product. You must also add the Quota policy to
API proxies that are referenced by the API product.
For more information, see
Quotas .
LLM token quota limit
Optional
Sets a token quota for an API product. This allows you to manage
and limit token consumption for Large Language Model (LLM) API calls
over a specified time period (e.g., minute, hour, day, or month).
When creating an API product, set LLM token quota limit to
Enabled and then enter a value.
For more information, see the
LLMTokenQuota policy .
Allowed OAuth scope
Optional
If you are using OAuth with the API product, enter a comma-separated list of OAuth
scopes that you want the API product to allow (such as Read or other scopes that apps send
with their API calls). For more information, see
OAuth scopes .
Operations
Specify operations allowed on an HTTP-based API proxy, including resource paths, HTTP methods, and quotas.
Operations let you
control which REST methods and have access to which
resource paths in an API product, and how
many such calls can be made (with Quota).
To configure operation details, click + ADD AN OPERATION in the Operations section. The
Operation view displays.
Field
Required?
Description
API proxy
Required
Select the API proxy to associate with this operation.
Path
Required
Enter the resource path for the operation.
You can use the operation path to allow or disallow requests to specific URIs. For
example, if you set the operation's source to the music API
proxy with a base path of /music , the API product allows calls to
all the subpaths under /music . However, if you want the API product to allow access to only the
venues resource path which has a URI of /music/venues , add
the /venues as the operation's path. You can do this for all operations, or
specific operations.
In this case, calls to /music/venues?name=paramount are allowed, but
calls to /music/artists?name=Jack%Johnson are blocked.
Note that there are special rules for wildcards in resource paths, as described in
Configuring resource paths .
Methods
Optional
Select one or more HTTP request methods in the drop-down list. (These methods are
sometimes known as HTTP verbs .) Apigee allows
requests to the API proxy that only match the methods you select.
The default is no selection, which allows requests with any HTTP methods.
If you do not select at least one method, Apigee inserts ALL as
the value of this field when you save the operation.
For information about the functionality of the HTTP request methods, see
HTTP request methods .
Quota
Optional
Specify quota limits for this operation. For details on how quotas are counted, see
Understanding quota counters .
Custom attributes
Optional
See Custom attributes .
LLM Operations
Specify operations allowed on an LLM-based API proxy, including
resource paths, models, HTTP methods, and token quotas. LLM Operations let
you control which models can be
accessed and how many tokens can be used in an API product.
To configure LLM operation details, click + ADD AN OPERATION in the
LLM Operations section. The LLM Operation view displays.
Field
Required?
Description
Proxy
Required
Select the API proxy to associate with this LLM operation.
Path
Required
Enter the resource path for the LLM operation. This is often the path to a specific LLM model or function.
For example, if you have an API proxy with a base path of /llm , and you want to provide access to a specific model at /llm/gemini-pro , you would enter /gemini-pro as the operation's path.
Wildcards can be used in the resource path. For example, a path of /models/* would allow access to all models under the /models/ path.
Models
Required
Select the LLM model to associate with this operation. The available models will depend on the configuration of the API proxy.
Method
Optional
Select one or more HTTP request methods. For LLM operations, this is typically POST .
If no method is selected, Apigee allows requests with any HTTP method. When the operation is saved, ALL will be inserted as the value if no method is selected.
LLM Token Quota
Optional
Specify token-based quota limits for this operation. This can include limits on the number of tokens per minute, per day, etc.
Custom attributes
Optional
See Custom attributes .
GraphQL Operations
To configure GraphQL operation details, click + ADD AN OPERATION in the Graphql Operations section. The
Operation view displays. See also
Using GraphQL .
Field
Required?
Description
API proxy
Required
Select the API proxy to associate with this operation.
Operation name
Required
Specify a name for the operation
Operation type
Optional
Select one or more GraphQL operation types in the drop-down list. Apigee allows
requests to the API proxy that only match the operation types you select.
The default is no selection, which allows requests with any operation type.
If you do not select at least one type, Apigee inserts ALL as
the value of this field when you save the operation.
For information about the functionality of the GraphQL operation types, see
Queries and Mutations .
Quota
Optional
Specify quota limits for this operation. This quota supersedes the quota set on
the API product. See Quota .
Custom attributes
Optional
See Custom attributes .
gRPC Operations
To configure gRPC operation details, click + ADD AN OPERATION in the gRPC Operations section. The
Operation view displays. See also
Creating gRPC API proxies .
See Creating gRPC API proxies
for information on gRPC proxy support.
Field
Required?
Description
API proxy
Required
Select the API proxy to associate with this operation.
Service name
Required
Specify a name for the operation.
For the current release, there is no option to provide the target server name. (The service name and the target server are the same.)
gRPC methods in service
Optional
Enter the available gRPC methods, using a comma-separated list for multiple methods.
Quota
Optional
Specify quota limits for these operations. This quota supersedes the quota set on
the API product. See Quota .
Custom attributes
Optional
See Custom attributes .
Custom attributes
Custom attributes are key/value pairs that can be used in many ways, including
helping control API proxy execution.
In total, an API product can have up to 18 custom attributes, including those set on
operations.
For example, you can create a custom attribute called deprecated with a
value of true or false . In your API proxy flow, you can check
the value of the API product's deprecated attribute. If its value is
true , you can throw an error with the RaiseFault policy because you
want that operation to behave as if it is deprecated and no longer supported.
Tip: When you want to refer to the custom attribute at runtime, you must use a
VerifyAPIKey policy in your API proxy. You access the value of the custom attribute as
a flow variable with the following syntax:
verifyapikey. POLICY_NAME .apiproduct. ATTRIBUTE_NAME
Warning: Do not set the name of your custom attribute to
access . This attribute name is reserved for use by Apigee and will cause an error if used.
Quota
You can define the quota settings for the API product or per operation scope. There are three
fields that you must specify when you define a quota:
The maximum number of requests to allow from a developer app for the
specified period. This field corresponds to the <Allow> element in a Quota
policy.
The reset time interval of the quota. This field corresponds to the
<Interval> element in a Quota policy.
The reset period unit (or time unit), such as day, week, or month. This field
corresponds to the <TimeUnit> element in a Quota policy.
This example sets a limit of 1,000 requests to the API product per day, by adding:
1000 for the maximum number of requests.
1 for the reset time interval.
day for the reset period unit.
When you define a quota for an operation, you are required to enter values for all
three fields in the Quota section.
You can define a distinct quota for each operation. If an operation specifies multiple HTTP
methods, the quota applies for all of the methods on that operation. To allow distinct quotas
for each method, define multiple operations with a single method on each operation.
If you set these values in both the Quota policy and on the API product (in the UI
as described here or with the API products API , the API product UI/API settings
take precedence.
Configuring resource paths
Note the following rules for resource paths:
/ : Indicates that the base path and all subpaths of the base path are
supported.
/** : Indicates that all subpaths of the base path are supported (but
not the base path).
/* : Indicates that only URIs one level down from the base path are
supported.
Resource paths specified on the API product or on its operations
apply to all API proxies added to the API product.
More inclusive, less specific resource paths take precedence over those that are
more specific. For example, if you add / and /** , the
/ resource path takes precedence and the /** resource path is
ignored.
Using wildcards in resource paths
It is important to note that in Apigee's resource path definitions, a single asterisk ( * ) or double asterisk ( ** )
is not permitted as part of a path segment's name (for example, /abc*/a ), but is permitted when used as a full path segment
to represent a wildcard (for example, /*/a ) or a greedy path match (for example, /abc/** ).
For example:
Valid: /*/a or /abc/** . The wildcard is its own subpath.
Invalid: /abc/*a or /abc*/a . The wildcard is combined with other characters in the subpath.
This rule ensures that the wildcard is interpreted as a clear and explicit placeholder for an entire path segment, rather
than a pattern to be matched within a single path segment's name.
Default behavior of resource paths
The following table shows the default behavior of an API product for
different resource paths. In this example, the API proxy has a base path of
/v1/weatherapikey . The API product resource path applies to the path suffix after
the base path.
Request URI
Allowed for /
Allowed for /*
Allowed for /**
Allowed for /*/2/**
Allowed for /*/2/*
/v1/weatherapikey
/v1/weatherapikey /
/v1/weatherapikey /1
/v1/weatherapikey /1/
/v1/weatherapikey /1/2
/v1/weatherapikey /1/2/
/v1/weatherapikey /1/2/3/
/v1/weatherapikey /1/a/2/3/
A resource path of / in an API product
supports the base path and all subpaths. For example, if the base path of
the API proxy is /v1/weatherapikey , then the API product supports requests to
/v1/weatherapikey and to any subpaths, such as
/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss , /v1/weatherapikey/region/CA , and so on.
For additional information, see Making sense of API Product configuration .
Editing an API product
Note: To improve performance, API product information, such as
resource path definitions, are cached for a short time (approximately five minutes). As
a result, edits that you make to an API product may not take effect immediately.
Note: We recommend that you avoid making concurrent update requests for the same resource. Near-simultaneous writes to the same entity can result in conflicts and unexpected behavior. Ensure operations are sequential when modifying a single resource.
To edit an API product:
Go to the Products overview page:
Go to API products
Click in the API product row that you want to edit. Apigee displays
the API product details.
Click edit EDIT .
Edit the API product's settings, as required.
You cannot edit an existing API resource. Instead, you must delete the API
resource and add a new version with the corrected values if you want to change it.
You might delete a resource if it is malfunctioning or requires more
development. When deleted, that resource is no longer part of the current API product. Any app
that uses the API product can no longer access the deleted resource. Deleted resources are
removed from an API product but are not deleted from the system, so they can still be used by
other API products.
(Optional) If Apigee Monetization is enabled, create a rate plan for the API product by
clicking Add rateplan .
Click Save .
Your changes take effect within a short period of time (approximately five minutes).
Deleting an API product
Note: To improve performance, API product information such as
resource path definitions are cached for a short period of time (approximately five minutes). As
a result, when you delete an API product, it may not take effect immediately.
Before you can delete an API product, you must unregister/unassociate any developer apps associated with the product.
You can do so by either deleting the apps
or revoking the app API keys .
To delete an API product:
Go to the Products overview page:
Go to API products
Open the Actions menu in the API product row to delete and select Delete .
After you confirm the delete operation, the deletion takes effect within a short period of
time (approximately five minutes).
