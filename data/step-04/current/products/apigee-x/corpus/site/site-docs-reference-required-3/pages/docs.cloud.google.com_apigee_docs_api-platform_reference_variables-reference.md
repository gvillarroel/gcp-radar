error
proxy
variable
fault

ratelimit
Each of these variables is described in the sections that follow.
This document does not include flow variables that are specific to a single
policy. Those flow variables are documented with the policy that introduces
them. For example, the responsecache flow variable is documented
with the ResponseCache policy . For the list of available policies, see
Policy reference overview .
Flow variable terminology
A flow variable refers to a value within a context. The value of a flow variable can
be
either a primitive type (such as a string, boolean, or integer) or a reference to a specific
object, such as an object instantiated by Apigee during request/response processing.
Whether a flow variable refers to a primitive type or an object depends on the
context—the time at which you refer to it. The context for a flow variable is the
flow
segment in which an API proxy processes a request/response. For example, in any segment of the
response flow context, the response flow variable
refers to the response object.
In most cases, you can think of flow variables as referencing an object. To refer to
properties
of that object, you use dot notation. For example, to access the content property
of response , use response.content .
Working with flow variables
For information on using flow variables, see
Flow variables
overview .
Keep the following in mind when working with flow variables:
Each flow variable, such as request , has properties that you access using
dot-notation syntax. For example:
request.headers.count
Not all flow variables are accessible from all policies or tools. For example, in the
request PreFlow, you won't be able to access the response .
Most properties are read only. Where some are read/write, they might be read only, too,
depending on where in the flow you access them.
Some policies define policy-specific flow variables. For example, the
ResponseCache policy defines a responsecache variable. For more
information, see the
policies
reference .
Do not rely on undocumented variables in your API proxies and apps. For example, do not
rely on the values in the undocumented X-Apigee.* headers in your API proxies as these
headers are not intended for customer use and can be removed or changed by Apigee at any
time.
For more information, see:

flows
Tools and policies:
The Debug tool lets you see
the values of flow variables as you step through the API proxy flow.
The AssignMessage policy lets you modify the variables in your API proxy
flow.

Property
Type
Read/Write
Description
Scope begins
proxy.basepath
String
Read only
The value of the Base Path in your API proxy endpoint configuration. The base path is the left-most URI
fragment that follows the host in the URL. Conditional flow URIs follow the base
path.
Suppose that you have an API Proxy Endpoint configured with a basepath of /v2/weatherapi .
(See Proxy Endpoint configuration
for details.)
In that case, if the inbound request uses the URL https://myhost.example.net/v2/weatherapi/forecastrss?w=12797282 , then:
The host name is myhost.example.net . You can retrieve this by reading the variable request.header.host .
The base path is /v2/weatherapi . Retrieve this by reading the variable proxy.basepath .
The path suffix is /forecastrss . Retrieve this by reading the variable proxy.pathsuffix .
If you define a dynamic Base Path in your API proxy configuration, such as
/v2/*/weatherapi code>, then the proxy.basepath variable
is set to the dynamic path. To retrieve the actual URL for the request, read
and parse the variable proxy.url .
Proxy request
proxy.client.ip
String
Read only
The X-Forwarded-For address of the inbound call, which is the
IP address Apigee received from the last external TCP handshake. This could be the calling
client or a load balancer.

Read only
The name attribute configured for the ProxyEndpoint.
Proxy request
proxy.pathsuffix
String
Read only
The value of the path suffix in the URL that is sent from the client and received at
the ProxyEndpoint.
The basepath is the left-most path component that uniquely identifies an API proxy within
an Environment Group. Suppose that you have an API Proxy endpoint configured with a basepath
of /v2/weatherapi . In that case, a request sent to
https://myhost.example.net/v2/weatherapi/forecastrss?w=12797282 ,
the proxy.pathsuffix variable will hold the string /forecastrss .
Proxy request
proxy.url
String
Read only
Gets the complete URL associated with the proxy request received by the ProxyEndpoint,
including any query parameters present.
For an example that constructs a request URL using the original request
host (rather than the router host used in proxy.url ), see
Access request messages .

request.uri
String
Read only
In an API proxy, the proxy <BasePath> in the ProxyEndpoint (in
addition to the proxy's base URL) maps to the target service URL in
the TargetEndpoint. For example:
<ProxyEndpoint>
...
<BasePath>/my-mock-proxy</BasePath>
Points to
<TargetEndpoint>
...
<HTTPTargetConnection>
http://mocktarget.apigee.net
</HTTPTargetConnection>
In the request , request.uri is the proxy base path +
the remainder of the address, including query parameters.
In the response , request.uri is the remainder of the
address, including query parameters, after the HTTPTargetConnection.
The difference is because the original request came into the proxy, but then the proxy
makes another request to the target service.
Let's say the following call is made to our sample proxy, which has a base path
of /my-mock-proxy :
http://my_org-test.apigee.net/my-mock-proxy/ user?user=Dude
And the proxy calls:
http://mocktarget.apigee.net
Which appends /user?user=Dude to that URL.
Request: request.uri = /my-mock-proxy/user?user=Dude
Response: request.uri = /user?user=Dude
Proxy request (differs in the response)
request.url
String
Read only
The complete URL of the request made to the target endpoint, including the
query string parameters, but not including the port number (if specified).
For example, if you make a call to a sample proxy
http://my_org-test.apigee.net/my-mock-proxy/user?user=Dude , and the target endpoint
is http://example.com:8080 , then the value is:
Request: n/a

Describes the target of the request.
The following table describes the properties of the target variable:
Property
Type
Read/Write
Description
Scope begins
target.basepath
String
Read only
The resource path (not including the domain) to the target service, excluding query
parameters, that is defined in the proxy's TargetEndpoint.
For example, say an API proxy calls the following target:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
...
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net/user?user=Dude</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
In this example, the target.basepath is /user .
If the target were this:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
...
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
The target.basepath would be null.
Target request
