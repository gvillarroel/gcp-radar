View
Apigee Edge documentation.
Note: In environments enabled for archive deployments , you cannot build API proxies using the Apigee UI, API, or gcloud.
To build API proxies for archive deployments using Apigee in VS Code,see Developing API proxies using Apigee in VS Code.
Apigee enables you to quickly expose backend services as APIs. You do this by creating an
API proxy that provides a facade for the backend service that you want to expose. You need
to provide only the network address for the backend service, along with some information that
Apigee uses to create the API proxy that is exposed to developers.
The API proxy decouples your backend service implementation from the API that developers
consume. This shields developers from future changes to your backend services. As you update
backend services, developers, insulated from those changes, can continue to call the API
uninterrupted.
This topic provides information about the various types of proxies and the settings for them.
For step-by-step instructions on creating proxies, see the following topics:
Tutorial: Build your first API proxy
Creating an API proxy
Creating an API proxy using the UI
The easiest way to create an API proxy is using the Create Proxy wizard.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Proxy development > API proxies page.
Go to API proxies
Click + Create .
The Create Proxy wizard displays and leads you through the steps to generate
and add minimal features to an API proxy.
The wizard enables you to create an API proxy from the following sources:
Category
Type
Description
General template
Reverse proxy (most common)
An API proxy that routes inbound requests to existing HTTP backend services. Can be
a JSON or XML API. See Creating a reverse
proxy for an HTTP service later in this section.
No target
An API proxy with no API backend ("no target"). Similar to
Creating a reverse proxy for an HTTP
service described previously, except you will not specify an existing API when
defining the API proxy details.
Upload proxy bundle
An existing API proxy bundle (for example one of the
sample API proxies
available on GitHub). See
Importing an API proxy from an API proxy bundle .
Proxy with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
An API proxy that includes an EventFlow for streaming server-sent events (SSE).
For more information, see Streaming server-sent events .
AI template
Prompt Token Limit
Similar to a spike arrest, this policy helps you control the rate
of token usage from user prompts to prevent abuse.
For more information, see
Get started with Apigee AI Token Policies .
LLM Token Quota
Manage and limit token consumption for LLM API calls.
For more information, see
Get started with Apigee AI Token Policies .
Proxy with Model Armor
Enforces safe AI interactions by sanitizing user prompts and model
responses. For more information, see
Get started with Apigee Model Armor policies .
Proxy with Semantic Cache
Cache responses to similar requests, optimizing response time and LLM
calls. For more information, see
Get started with semantic caching policies .
OpenAPI spec template
Reverse proxy (most common)
Generate the proxy from a valid OpenAPI
specification. For more information on this option, see
Using OpenAPI
Specifications to generate proxies later in this section.
No target
An API proxy with no API backend ("no target"). Similar to
Creating a reverse
proxy for an HTTP service described previously, except you
will not specify an existing API when
defining the API proxy details.
The following sections discuss the details of each proxy type.
Creating a reverse proxy for an HTTP service
Apigee generates reverse proxies based on the following information:
URL of the backend service.
URI path that uniquely identifies the API that will be exposed by the API proxy to
consumer apps.
The backend service URL typically represents a service-enabled application owned by your
organization. It can also point to a publicly available API. The API or service can be under your
control (for example, an internal HR application or a Rails application in the Cloud) or it can
be a third-party API or service (for example, Twitter or Instagram).
The following Proxy details are available after accessing the Create Proxy wizard
and selecting a proxy type :
Field
Description
Name
Name displayed for your API. Specify alphanumeric characters, dash (-), or underscore (_).
Base path
URI fragment that appears after the http://[host] or https://[host] address of your
API proxy. Apigee uses the base path URI to match and route incoming request messages
to the proper API proxy.
Note : The API proxy base path defaults to the value specified for
the Name field converted to all lower case.
Following the base path are any additional resource URLs. The full URL
structure that clients use to call your API proxy is as follows:
https://[host]/ BASE_PATH / CONDITIONAL_FLOW_PATH
Note : The base path must be unique; you cannot deploy two API proxies with the same
base path. If you edit a deployed API proxy
and set the base path to the same value as the base path of another API proxy, Apigee automatically undeploys
the API proxy when you save it. Before you can redeploy the API proxy, you must edit the base path so that it is unique.
Use wildcards in base paths
Use one or more /*/ wildcards in API proxy base paths to
future-proof your API proxies. For example, a base path of /team/*/members
allows clients to call https://[host]/team/ blue /members
and https://[host]/team/ green /members without you
needing to create new API proxies to support new teams. Note that /**/ is not
supported.
Note : For Apigee's recommendations on API versioning, see Versioning in the Web API Design: The Missing Link
e-book.
-->
Description
(Optional) Description of the API.
Target (Existing API)
URL of the backend service that this API proxy invokes.
Importing an API proxy from an API proxy bundle
Note: When importing an API proxy from an API proxy bundle, you are
responsible for
configuring security in and adding policies to the bundle. The UI does not prompt you to add
security or policies when importing the
bundle, as described in Adding
security later in this section.
Often you define API proxies as a collection of XML files, along with any other
supporting files. By defining your API proxies as a set of files external to Apigee you can
maintain them in a source-control system, and then import them into Apigee for testing and
deployment.
To import API proxies from an API proxy bundle, perform the following steps:
Access the Create Proxy wizard as described in
Creating an API proxy using the UI .
Specify the API proxy bundle details.
In the Proxy template menu, select Upload proxy bundle .
In the Proxy details section, enter the Proxy name , upload the zip file and click Next .
In the Deploy section, select the deployment environments, if desired, and click Create .
Creating gRPC API proxies
In addition to REST API proxies, Apigee supports gRPC API proxies with passthrough
support only at this time. With passthrough support , the gRPC payload is itself
opaque to Apigee and the traffic is routed from the gRPC client to the preconfigured gRPC
target server in the target configuration.
At this time, Apigee gRPC API proxies:
Support unary gRPC requests.
Can't use policies that affect the payload.
Can be used in API products that are not associated with GraphQL or REST proxies. API
product-specific quotas and other operation settings apply across all proxies in the product.
Are not supported in Apigee hybrid.
Use two gRPC-specific flow variables :
request.grpc.rpc.name and request.grpc.service.name .
Can be monitored with these gRPC-specific Apigee Analytics variables :
x_apigee_grpc_rpc_name , x_apigee_grpc_service_name , and x_apigee_grpc_status .
Return gRPC status codes .
You must also configure your load balancer to support gRPC. See
Using gRPC with your applications
and Using gcloud CLI commands to create routing for gRPC .
To create a gRPC API proxy, first define a gRPC target server (see
Creating TargetServers )
and then specify that target server when creating the new proxy.
Using gcloud CLI commands to create routing for gRPC
This section shows example commands for creating routing for gRPC proxies, using the
gcloud CLI . The instructions include setting up
load balancers, a target server, and a MIG.
This section is not as a comprehensive guide to creating the routing.
These examples might not be appropriate for all use cases. Also, these instructions assume familiarity with
External routing (MIG)
and Cloud load balancer gRPC configuration .
Set environment variables
These environment variables are used in the commands in the subsections.
PROJECT_ID = YOUR_PROJECT_ID
MIG_NAME = YOUR_MIG_NAME
VPC_NAME = default
VPC_SUBNET = default
REGION = REGION_NAME
APIGEE_ENDPOINT = ENDPOINT
CERTIFICATE_NAME = CERTIFICATE_NAME
DOMAIN_HOSTNAME = DOMAIN_HOSTNAME
Example gcloud CLI commands for creating routing for gRPC proxies using new load balancers
This section shows example commands for creating gRPC proxies using the
gcloud CLI and a new load balancer. The
instructions include setting up the load balancer, a target server, and a MIG.
Create the instance template
gcloud compute instance - templates create $ MIG_NAME \
-- project $ PROJECT_ID \
-- region $ REGION \
-- network $ VPC_NAME \
-- subnet $ VPC_SUBNET \
-- tags = https - server , apigee - mig - proxy , gke - apigee - proxy \

--format="get(name,managed.status, managed.Status)"
Create the Global Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB)
Create a health check
gcloud compute health-checks create https hc-apigee-envoy-443 \
--project $PROJECT_ID --port 443 --global \
--request-path /healthz/ingress
Create the backend service for http1
gcloud compute backend - services create YOUR_BACKEND_1 \
-- project $ PROJECT_ID \
-- protocol HTTPS \
-- health - checks hc - apigee - envoy - 443 \
-- port - name https \

-- protocol HTTP2 \
-- health - checks hc - apigee - envoy - 443 \
-- port - name https \
-- timeout 302 s \
-- connection - draining - timeout 300 s \
-- global
Add MIGs to the backend service. In this example we are reusing the MIG, but you
could also create a new pair of MIGs.
gcloud compute backend - services add - backend YOUR_BACKEND_1 \
-- project $PROJECT_ID -- instance - group $MIG_NAME \
-- instance - group - region $REGION \
-- balancing - mode UTILIZATION -- max - utilization 0.8 -- global
gcloud compute backend - services add - backend YOUR_BACKEND_2 \
-- project $PROJECT_ID -- instance - group $MIG_NAME \
-- instance - group - region $REGION \
-- balancing - mode UTILIZATION -- max - utilization 0.8 -- global
Create a load balancing URL map. Check first whether you already have a URL map. If
you do, make sure to modify that map according to the requirements below rather than
overwrite it.
Create a YAML file or use your existing file, at /tmp/apigee-map.yaml , with this
configuration. Note that the URL map http1 backend is default.
defaultService : projects /$ PROJECT_ID / global / backendServices / YOUR_BACKEND_1
name : matcher1
routeRules :
- matchRules :
- headerMatches :
- headerName : Content - Type
prefixMatch : application / grpc
prefixMatch : /
priority : 100
routeAction :
weightedBackendServices :
- backendService : projects /$ PROJECT_ID / global / backendServices / YOUR_BACKEND_2
weight : 100
Validate the URL map:
gcloud compute url-maps validate --source /tmp/apigee-map.yaml --project $PROJECT_ID
Create the url map with header-based routing:
gcloud compute url - maps import apigee - http1 - http2 \
-- source / tmp / apigee - map . yaml \
-- global -- project $ PROJECT_ID
Create a load balancing target HTTPS proxy
gcloud compute target-https-proxies create apigee-envoy-https-proxy \
--project $PROJECT_ID --url-map apigee-envoy-proxy-map \
--ssl-certificates $CERTIFICATE_NAME
Reserve an IPV4 External IP and create firewall rules for the load balancer
gcloud compute addresses create lb - ipv4 - vip - 1 \
-- project $ PROJECT_ID \
-- network - tier = PREMIUM \
-- ip - version = IPV4 \
-- global
gcloud compute addresses describe lb - ipv4 - vip - 1 \
-- project $ PROJECT_ID -- format = "get(address)" -- global
gcloud compute forwarding - rules create apigee - envoy - https - lb - rule \
-- project $ PROJECT_ID -- address lb - ipv4 - vip - 1 -- global \
-- target - https - proxy apigee - envoy - https - proxy -- ports 443
Create a firewall rule
gcloud compute firewall-rules create k8s-allow-lb-to-apigee-envoy \
--description "Allow incoming from GLB on TCP port 443 to Apigee Proxy" \
--project $PROJECT_ID --network $VPC_NAME --allow=tcp:443 \
--source-ranges=130.211.0.0/22,35.191.0.0/16 --target-tags=gke-apigee-proxy
Example gcloud CLI commands for creating routing for gRPC proxies for existing load balancers
This section shows example commands for creating gRPC proxies using the
gcloud CLI and an existing load balancer. The
instructions include setting up the load balancer, a target server, and a MIG.
Create another backend service for http2
# Create backend service for http2
gcloud compute backend - services create YOUR_BACKEND_2 \
-- project $ PROJECT_ID \
-- protocol HTTP2 \
-- health - checks hc - apigee - envoy - 443 \
-- port - name https \
-- timeout 302 s \
-- connection - draining - timeout 300 s \
-- global
Attach the second backend service to the MIG
gcloud compute backend - services add - backend YOUR_BACKEND_2 \
-- project $PROJECT_ID -- instance - group $MIG_NAME \
-- instance - group - region $REGION \
-- balancing - mode UTILIZATION -- max - utilization 0.8 -- global
List the URL map for the existing Apigee GCLB
gcloud compute url-maps list -project $PROJECT_ID
Pick up the correct URL map name used for Apigee load balancing
gcloud compute url - maps export APIGEE_URL_MAP_NAME - project $ PROJECT_ID
Create a load balancing URL map YAML file
If you already have an existing URL map, merge this configuration into that. Otherwise, create a YAML
file at /tmp/apigee-map.yaml with this configuration.
defaultService : projects / dg - runtime - test1 / global / backendServices / YOUR_BACKEND_1
name : matcher1
routeRules :
- matchRules :
- headerMatches :
- headerName : Content - Type
prefixMatch : application / grpc
prefixMatch : /
priority : 100
routeAction :
weightedBackendServices :
- backendService : projects / dg - runtime - test1 / global / backendServices / YOUR_BACKEND_2
weight : 100
Apply the new YAML for gRPC routing
gcloud compute url - maps import APIGEE_URL_MAP_NAME \
-- source / tmp / apigee - map . yaml \
-- global - project $ PROJECT_ID
Adding security
Proxy security is achieved by adding a policy to your proxy. For more information on policies, see What's a policy . For more information on security, see Securing a proxy .
To add a security policy to your proxy:
Create a proxy as described in Creating an API proxy .
Add a security policy as described in one of the sections listed in Securing a proxy . The most common security policies used are API keys and OAuth2 .
Adding support for CORS
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a standard mechanism that allows a web browser to make
direct requests to another domain. The CORS standard defines a set of HTTP headers that web
browsers and servers use to implement cross-domain communication.
You can add support for CORS by adding the CORS policy to the request PreFlow of the ProxyEndpoint .
For more detailed information about CORS support, including adding CORS preflight support
to a proxy, see Adding CORS
support to an API proxy .
Adding Quotas
Quotas protect your backend service from high traffic under Quota .
See Quotas .
(Not available if Pass-through authorization is selected.)
Using OpenAPI Specifications to generate proxies
This section discusses the Use OpenAPI option that is available for generating from an OpenAPI
Specification the following types of API proxies: reverse or no target.
What is an
OpenAPI Specification?
"The Open API Initiative (OAI) is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral
API description format based on the Swagger Specification." For more information, see
OpenAPI Initiative .
An OpenAPI Specification uses a standard format to describe a RESTful API.
Written in either JSON or YAML format, an OpenAPI Specification is machine readable, but is also
easy for humans to read and understand. The specification describes API elements such as
its base path, paths and verbs, headers, query parameters, operations, content types, response
descriptions, and more. In addition, an OpenAPI Specification is commonly used to generate API
documentation.
The following fragment from an OpenAPI Specification describes Apigee's mock target service,
http://mocktarget.apigee.net . For
more information, see OpenAPI spec for the helloworld sample .
openapi : 3.0.0
info :
description : OpenAPI Specification for the Apigee mock target service endpoint .
version : 1.0.0
title : Mock Target API
paths :
/ :
get :
summary : View personalized greeting
operationId : View a personalized greeting
description : View a personalized greeting for the specified or guest user .
parameters :
- name : user
in : query
description : Your user name .
required : false
schema :
type : string
responses :
"200" :
description : Success
/ help :
get :
summary : Get help
operationId : Get help
description : View help information about available resources in HTML format .
responses :
"200" :
description : Success
...
Through the Create Proxy wizard, you can import an OpenAPI Specification and use it to
generate an API proxy. Once the proxy is generated, you can use the Apigee UI to further develop it
by adding policies, implementing custom code, and so on&emdash;just like any Apigee
proxy.
Creating an API proxy from an OpenAPI Specification
Create your API proxies from an OpenAPI Specification. In just a few clicks, you'll have an API
proxy with the paths, parameters, conditional flows, and target endpoints generated automatically.
Then, you can add features such as OAuth security, rate limiting, and caching.
In the Create Proxy wizard, click Use OpenAPI Spec and follow the wizard to create
a reverse or no target proxy from an OpenAPI Specification. For details, see
Creating an API proxy
from an OpenAPI Specification .
Creating a new revision of an API proxy
To create a new revision of an API proxy, perform the following steps:
Open the Apigee UI.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Apigee > Proxy development > API proxies page.
Go to API proxies
Click the API proxy in the list that you want to copy.
Click the Develop tab.
Select the Save button and select Save as New Revision .
Backing up an API proxy
You can back up an existing API proxy as a set of XML files in an API proxy bundle. Once
exported to a bundle, you can import the API proxy to a new proxy, as described in
Importing an API proxy from an API proxy bundle
previously in this section. For more information, see
Download API proxies .
Creating an API proxy using the API
To create an API proxy using the API, see
Creating an API proxy .
About no target proxies
No target proxies in Apigee are useful when you want to process requests within Apigee itself without
forwarding them to a backend service. It's important to understand when this approach is appropriate.
Common use cases
Interacting with Apigee-managed data :
A no target proxy is useful in cases where you
only need to interact with Apigee-managed data, such as data stored in a key-value map (KVM)
or the Apigee cache .
For example, you can use a no-target proxy to retrieve data, such as user session data or configuration data,
from the KVM. In this case, there's no need to call a backend service. All that's needed is a
KeyValueMapOperations policy
in the proxy flow. For another example, you might want the caller to request that a cache be flushed. You can
do this by invoking the InvalidateCache policy , without any need to connect to a target.
Using mock APIs : You can create mock APIs to simulate API behavior before the backend
implementation is complete to enable frontend development to progress independently. To learn
more about creating mock APIs, see OpenAPI Mock API Proxy .
Token management : Apigee can issue OAuthV2 tokens, and that is usually done via a no-target proxy.
Testing policy behavior : A no-target proxy can be useful when you want to try
out Apigee policies to test their behavior.
