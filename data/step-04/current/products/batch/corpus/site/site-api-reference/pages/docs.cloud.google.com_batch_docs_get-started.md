This page describes how to get started with Batch for Google Cloud.
Overview
Batch is a fully managed service that
lets you schedule, queue, and execute batch processing
workloads on Google Cloud resources.
For example, consider using Batch for
high performance computing (HPC), machine learning (ML), and
data-processing workloads.
Batch provisions resources and manages capacity on your
behalf, allowing your batch workloads to run at scale.
Using Batch, you don't need to configure and manage third-party
job schedulers, provision and deprovision resources, or request resources one
zone at a time. To run a job, you specify parameters for the resources
required for your workload, then Batch obtains resources and
queues the job for execution. Batch provides native
integration with other Google Cloud services to aid in the scheduling,
execution, storage, and analysis of batch jobs, so you can focus on
submitting a job and consuming the results.
Batch consists of the following components:
Job: a scheduled program that runs a set of tasks to completion without
any user interaction, typically for computational workloads.
For example, a job might be a single shell script or a
complex, multipart computation.
Specifically, a Batch job represents an array of one or
more tasks and the environment to run those tasks in.
You define the program for the job as a sequence of one
or more runnables. Each task runs the sequence of runnables on the
job's resources. You can configure a job's tasks to run
in parallel or sequentially.
Task: one execution of a job's sequence of runnables. When a job has
multiple tasks, you specify how you want each execution to vary by
referencing the environment variable for a task's index in the job's
runnables.
Runnable: an executable script or container that you define as part of
a job.
Resources: the infrastructure needed to run a job. At minimum,
you only need to specify the compute resources required per task:
CPU cores, memory, and (if required) extra boot disk storage. Optionally,
you can also specify other resource options for the job.
Batch automatically creates and deletes the resources
that meet your specifications during the job's run time.
Specifically, each Batch job runs on a
regional managed instance group (MIG), which is a group of one or more
matching Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances that are each
located in one of the included zones. Each VM has dedicated hardware for
CPU cores and memory—which affect the performance of your
job—and a boot disk—which stores an operating
system (OS) image and instructions for running your job.
If specified, a job might also include or access additional
resources—for example, GPUs or external storage volumes.
The number of VMs provisioned for a job depends on the hardware requirements
and task scheduling options that you specify.
In summary, Batch lets you create and run jobs that each
automatically provision and utilize the resources required to execute its tasks.
For more information about job behavior and options, see the
Job creation and execution overview page.
Pricing
There is no additional cost for using Batch. You are only
charged for the cost of the underlying resources required to execute your jobs.
For more information about the costs associated with Batch and
how to filter Cloud Billing reports to view Batch costs,
see Pricing .
Restrictions
Batch has the following restrictions:
You can't exceed the
Batch quotas and limits for your project.
Jobs can only use machine types from the following machine series:
General-purpose: C4, C4A, C4D, C3, C3D, E2, N4, N2D, N2, N1, and T2D
Compute-optimized: C2, C2D, and H3
Memory-optimized: M3, M2, and M1
Accelerator-optimized: A4, A3 Ultra, A3 Mega, A3 High, A2, and G2
You can specify only one machine type, which can be
predefined or
custom ,
per job.
You can't specify more than one task group per job. All jobs have only one
task group named group0 .
Prerequisites
To start using Batch, complete the following prerequisites:
If your project has not used Batch before,
enable Batch for your project .
Set up Batch for each new user .
Enable Batch for a project
To start using Batch with a project, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Make sure that Batch is enabled for your project:
Enable the Batch, Compute Engine, and Cloud Logging APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
Make sure your project has one or more
service accounts
with the necessary permissions to create and access the resources
for running Batch jobs.
Importantly, any users that you want to allow to create and run
Batch jobs in your project must be
granted permission to use one of these service accounts.
So, don't select service accounts that have more permissions
than you want to grant to these users.
The service account each job uses by default is the
Compute Engine default service account ,
but you can also
customize which service account a job uses .
Note: Jobs default to using the
Compute Engine default service account, which is
granted the Editor role ( roles/editor ) by default. Although
this default configuration already provides the following permissions,
using the Editor role ( roles/editor ) is
not recommended for production environments .
Unless you plan to use only the default configuration for your job's
service accounts, grant the following IAM roles to any
service accounts that your project uses for Batch jobs.
Batch Agent Reporter ( roles/batch.agentReporter ) on the project
To let jobs generate logs in Cloud Logging: Logs Writer
( roles/logging.logWriter ) on the project
The service account that you use for a job might also require
additional roles based on the configuration options that you want to
use for your jobs. Refer to the documentation for each task to see if
additional permissions are required. For more information about
granting roles to service accounts, see
Restricting service accounts
and Manage access to service accounts .
Make sure you are familiar with your project's
Batch service agent:
After you create a
Batch job, the Batch service agent
is automatically created for your project with the following name:
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-cloudbatch.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with the
project number
of your project.
The Batch service agent is automatically granted the
Google Batch Service Agent ( roles/batch.serviceAgent ) IAM role .
This configuration is required for your project to use
Batch.
Warning: Do not revoke the roles that are automatically granted to the
Batch service agent. Otherwise, Batch
might not work.
However, certain use cases—for example,
running a job on a Shared VPC network —require
you to grant additional permissions to your project's
Batch service agent.
Caution: The Batch service agent is used
for creating all Batch jobs.
Consequently, any permissions that are granted to your
Batch service agent can be used by any
principal (user or service account) in the project that
has permissions to create Batch jobs
whenever the principal is creating a
Batch job.
For more information, see Service agents .
Set up Batch for a new user
To start using Batch as a user, do the following:
To get the permissions that you need to use Batch,
ask your administrator to grant you the required IAM roles
on the project. Refer to the documentation for each task to see its
required permissions.
For example, if you want to start learning how to use Batch
by creating a basic job, consider requesting roles for the following tasks:
To create jobs:
Batch Job Editor ( roles/batch.jobsEditor ) on the project
Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) on the
job's service account ,
which by default is the
default Compute Engine service account
To list and describe jobs: Batch Job Editor ( roles/batch.jobsEditor )
or Batch Job Viewer ( roles/batch.jobsViewer ) on the project
To view logs for jobs: Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) on the project
To delete jobs: Batch Job Editor ( roles/batch.jobsEditor ) on the project
For more information about granting roles, see
Manage access .
If you want to use the command-line examples for Batch,
set up the Google Cloud CLI by doing the following. Learn more about
authentication for the Google Cloud CLI .
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Recommended: Set a default project using the
gcloud config set project command :
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the
project ID
of your project.
