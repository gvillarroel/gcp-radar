AllocationPolicy ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
A Job's resource allocation policy describes when, where, and
how compute resources should be allocated for the Job.
Attributes
Name
Description
location
google.cloud.batch_v1.types.AllocationPolicy.LocationPolicy
Location where compute resources should be
allocated for the Job.
instances
MutableSequence[ google.cloud.batch_v1.types.AllocationPolicy.InstancePolicyOrTemplate ]
Describe instances that can be created by this
AllocationPolicy. Only instances[0] is supported now.
service_account
google.cloud.batch_v1.types.ServiceAccount
Defines the service account for Batch-created VMs. If
omitted, the `default Compute Engine service
account
labels
MutableMapping[str, str]
Custom labels to apply to the job and all the Compute Engine
resources that both are created by this allocation policy
and support labels.
Use labels to group and describe the resources they are
applied to. Batch automatically applies predefined labels
and supports multiple labels fields for each job, which
each let you apply custom labels to various resources. Label
names that start with "goog-" or "google-" are reserved for
predefined labels. For more information about labels with
Batch, see `Organize resources using
labels
network
google.cloud.batch_v1.types.AllocationPolicy.NetworkPolicy
The network policy.
If you define an instance template in the
InstancePolicyOrTemplate field, Batch will use the
network settings in the instance template instead of this
field.
placement
google.cloud.batch_v1.types.AllocationPolicy.PlacementPolicy
The placement policy.
tags
MutableSequence[str]
Optional. Tags applied to the VM instances.
The tags identify valid sources or targets for network
firewalls. Each tag must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
with RFC1035 __.
Classes
Accelerator
Accelerator ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
Accelerator describes Compute Engine accelerators to be
attached to the VM.
AttachedDisk
AttachedDisk ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
A new or an existing persistent disk (PD) or a local ssd
attached to a VM instance.
This message has oneof _ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
members.
.. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields
Disk
Disk ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
A new persistent disk or a local ssd.
A VM can only have one local SSD setting but multiple local SSD
partitions. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#pdspecs and
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#localssds .
This message has oneof _ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
members.
.. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields
InstancePolicy
InstancePolicy ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
InstancePolicy describes an instance type and resources
attached to each VM created by this InstancePolicy.
InstancePolicyOrTemplate
InstancePolicyOrTemplate ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
InstancePolicyOrTemplate lets you define the type of
resources to use for this job either with an InstancePolicy or
an instance template. If undefined, Batch picks the type of VM
to use and doesn't include optional VM resources such as GPUs
and extra disks.
This message has oneof _ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
members.
.. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields
LabelsEntry
LabelsEntry ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
The abstract base class for a message.
Parameters
Name
Description
kwargs
dict
Keys and values corresponding to the fields of the message.
mapping
Union[dict, .Message ]
A dictionary or message to be used to determine the values for this message.
ignore_unknown_fields
Optional(bool)
If True, do not raise errors for unknown fields. Only applied if mapping is a mapping type or there are keyword parameters.
LocationPolicy
LocationPolicy ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
NetworkInterface
NetworkInterface ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
A network interface.
NetworkPolicy
NetworkPolicy ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
NetworkPolicy describes VM instance network configurations.
PlacementPolicy
PlacementPolicy ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
PlacementPolicy describes a group placement policy for the
VMs controlled by this AllocationPolicy.
ProvisioningModel
ProvisioningModel ( value )
Compute Engine VM instance provisioning model.
Above SPOT VM is the preferable model for
preemptible VM instances: the old preemptible VM
model (indicated by this field) is the older
model, and has been migrated to use the SPOT
model as the underlying technology. This old
model will still be supported.
RESERVATION_BOUND (4):
Bound to the lifecycle of the reservation in
which it is provisioned.
FLEX_START (5):
Instance is provisioned with DWS Flex Start
and has limited max run duration.
