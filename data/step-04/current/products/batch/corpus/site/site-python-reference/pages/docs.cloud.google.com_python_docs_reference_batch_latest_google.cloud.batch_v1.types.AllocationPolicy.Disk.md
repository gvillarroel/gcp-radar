Disk ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
A new persistent disk or a local ssd.
A VM can only have one local SSD setting but multiple local SSD
partitions. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#pdspecs and
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#localssds .
This message has oneof _ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
members.

Attributes
Name
Description
image
str
URL for a VM image to use as the data source for this disk.
For example, the following are all valid URLs:
- Specify the image by its family name:
projects/{project}/global/images/family/{image_family}
- Specify the image version:
projects/{project}/global/images/{image_version}
You can also use Batch customized image in short names. The
following image values are supported for a boot disk:
- batch-debian : use Batch Debian images.
- batch-cos : use Batch Container-Optimized images.
- batch-hpc-rocky : use Batch HPC Rocky Linux images.
This field is a member of oneof _ data_source .
snapshot
str
Name of a snapshot used as the data source.
Snapshot is not supported as boot disk now.
This field is a member of oneof _ data_source .
type_
str
Disk type as shown in gcloud compute disk-types list .
For example, local SSD uses type "local-ssd". Persistent
disks and boot disks use "pd-balanced", "pd-extreme",
"pd-ssd" or "pd-standard". If not specified, "pd-standard"
will be used as the default type for non-boot disks,
"pd-balanced" will be used as the default type for boot
disks.
size_gb
int
Disk size in GB.
**Non-Boot Disk**: If the type specifies a persistent
disk, this field is ignored if data_source is set as
image or snapshot . If the type specifies a local
SSD, this field should be a multiple of 375 GB, otherwise,
the final size will be the next greater multiple of 375 GB.
**Boot Disk**: Batch will calculate the boot disk size based
on source image and task requirements if you do not speicify
the size. If both this field and the boot_disk_mib field
in task spec's compute_resource are defined, Batch will
only honor this field. Also, this field should be no smaller
than the source disk's size when the data_source is set
as snapshot or image . For example, if you set an
image as the data_source field and the image's default
disk size 30 GB, you can only use this field to make the
disk larger or equal to 30 GB.
disk_interface
str
Local SSDs are available through both "SCSI" and "NVMe"
interfaces. If not indicated, "NVMe" will be the default one
for local ssds. This field is ignored for persistent disks
as the interface is chosen automatically. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/persistent-disks#choose_an_interface.
