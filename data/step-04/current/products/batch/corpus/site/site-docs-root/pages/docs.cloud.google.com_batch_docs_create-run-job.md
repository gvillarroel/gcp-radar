Job creation and execution overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document explains the execution process and creation options for jobs.
Batch jobs let you run batch-processing workloads on
Google Cloud. To learn about the components of a job and the
prerequisites for using Batch, see
Get started with Batch .
How job creation and execution works
To use Batch, you create a job that specifies
your workload and its requirements, and then Batch
automatically runs it.
The details of how job creation and execution works are described
in the following sections:
Job lifecycle : understand the states that a job progresses
through from creation to deletion.
Job queuing and scheduling : understand the
factors that affect how long it takes for a job to start running.
Job execution : understand how a job's tasks run on its
resources during execution.
Job lifecycle
This section describes the lifecycle of a job and its tasks from creation
to deletion.
For each workload you want to run on Batch, you go through the
following basic process:
Create a job: You define the workload you want to run by specifying a
job's runnables, tasks, and any other requirements. The details for
creating a job are introduced in the
Job creation options section in this document.
Monitor and troubleshoot the job: When you finish creating a job, the
job is automatically queued, scheduled, and executed on the specified
resources. You can view the details of a created job or any of its task to
see the current state. If needed, you can cancel a job to stop it or prevent
it from running. After a job is running or finished, you can also monitor
and analyze the job using logs. If a job fails, you can troubleshoot it
using any error messages, status events, or logs to diagnose the issue
before recreating the job.
Delete or export the job: A job's information in Batch
remains available until you or Google Cloud deletes it.
Google Cloud automatically deletes a job 60 days after it finishes.
Before then, you can optionally delete the job yourself, or, if you need to
retain the info, you can export the job's information in
Batch before the job is deleted. Any information about a
job that's stored in other Google Cloud services aren't affected when
a job is deleted and have separate retention policies. For example, a job's
logs are automatically retained and deleted according to the
Cloud Logging retention policy.
After you create a job, it progresses through the following states:
Queued ( QUEUED ): the job request has been admitted and is waiting
in the queue. The job remains in your project's queue until it can be
scheduled, which happens when the required resources are available and the
jobs ahead of it have been assessed. However, to prevent your jobs from
becoming stale, if a job exceeds the
maximum wait time in the queue ,
Batch automatically fails the job instead of scheduling it.
Scheduled ( SCHEDULED ): the job has been selected from the queue
to start running and the resources are being allocated.
Running ( RUNNING ): the resources for the job have been created
successfully and its tasks can start running.
When a job is running, each of its tasks progresses through
the following states:
Pending ( PENDING ): the task is waiting for a VM to run on.
Assigned ( ASSIGNED ): the task has been assigned a VM to run on.
Running ( RUNNING ): the task is running on a VM.
A task finishes in one of the following states:
Succeeded ( SUCCEEDED ): the task succeeded because each of
its runnables met one of the following conditions:
The runnable succeeded (returned an
exit code
of zero).
The runnable failed (returned a nonzero exit code) but was a noncritical runnable (you enabled
the runnable's
ignoreExitStatus field ).
The runnable didn't finish but was a background runnable (you
enabled the runnable's
background field ).
Failed ( FAILED ): the task failed and stopped running because
at least one runnable didn't meet the preceding conditions.
The resources for the job are deleted before the job finishes.
A job finishes in one of the following states:
Succeeded ( SUCCEEDED ): the job succeeded because all of its tasks
succeeded.
Failed ( FAILED ): the job failed and stopped running because at
least one of its tasks failed.
Cancelled ( CANCELLED ): A user
cancelled the job before it succeeded or
failed.
For more information, see
job states and
task states
in the reference documentation.
Job queuing and scheduling
Generally, jobs are more likely to run and finish sooner if they are
smaller and require only a few common resources. For the example jobs
in Batch documentation, which are typically very small
and use minimal resources, you might see them finish running in as little as a
few minutes.
Specifically, the time a job takes to finish queueing and scheduling varies
for different jobs and at different times based on the following factors:
User-specified job prerequisites: any prerequisites that you
require to be met before the job is scheduled.
By default, a job doesn't have any prerequisites. Optionally, you can
specify that a job can't be scheduled until one or more existing jobs have
succeeded or failed. For more information, see
Schedule dependent jobs
( Preview ).
Job priority: the priority for a job relative to the priorities of
other jobs in your project.
You can optionally specify the priority of a job by including the
--priority flag for gcloud CLI
or the priority JSON field .
You can define the priority of a job as a number between
0 (lowest priority) and 99 (highest priority). Setting a higher
priority can help a job to run sooner than lower-priority jobs in your project.
If you don't configure the priority of a job, it defaults to using the
lowest priority, 0 . If two queued jobs have the same priority, the job
that was created first has the higher priority.
Job resource availability:
the availability of the job's required resources within the allowed
locations.
Firstly, a job cannot run if you happen to specify any resources that
aren't offered in that location—when this happens, the job fails with
a zone availability error .
Secondly, a job is more likely to be delayed or fail if any of its
required resources are in low capacity relative to the current demand due to
resource availability errors .
As a result, your job might run sooner when you require fewer,
more-common resources and don't restrict the job from running in
any zones in a region.
For more information about the resources for a job, see
Job execution in
this document. For more information about the locations you
can specify for a Batch job and its resources, see the
Locations page.
Quotas and limits: the thresholds that your project has
for Google Cloud resources and requests.
A job cannot run if it exceeds a limit or your project's quota for any of
the required resources or requests. When this happens,
Batch might delay a job and retry it at a later time or
fail the job and display a related error.
You can help prevent delays and errors for your job by creating jobs that
comply with all relevant limits and ensuring your project has enough
relevant quota. For more information, see
Batch quotas and limits .
Job execution
The time a job takes to be executed can vary based on task scheduling
and the job's resources.
Task scheduling
When a job runs, its tasks are scheduled according to the
scheduling policy ( schedulingPolicy ) field ,
which lets you specify one of the following options:
As soon as possible ( AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE ) (default):
tasks run as soon as resources are available and can run in parallel.
The amount of tasks that run at a time depends on the parallel tasks per VM
allowed by the job's resources and other configuration options as explained
in Job resources in this document.
In order ( IN_ORDER ): tasks run one at a time in increasing
index order.
Job resources
Each Batch job runs on a regional managed instance group (MIG),
which is a group of one or more matching
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances that are each located in one of
the included zones. Each VM has dedicated hardware for
CPU cores (specifically virtual CPUs (vCPUs) )
and memory—which affect the performance of your
job—and a boot disk—which stores an operating
system (OS) image and instructions for running your job.
During a job's run time, Batch automatically creates and
deletes resources that meet your specifications.
When you create a job, you configure its resources by specifying the following:
Compute resources per task: unless the default values are sufficient,
you must specify the compute resources—vCPUs, memory, and (if
required) extra boot disk storage—required for each task to run. For
more information, see the
compute resources per task ( computeResource ) fields .
VM resources: optionally, you can also specify the job's
VMs—such as the machine type and OS, and additional resources such as
GPUs and storage volumes—by using the
VM resource policy ( instances[].policy ) fields
or the alternative instances[].instanceTemplate field. If you leave these
fields undefined (which isn't possible when creating a job using the
Google Cloud console), Batch automatically tries to
select compatible VMs and doesn't add any additional resources.
Important: If you specify the VM resources for a job
(any instances[].policy or
instances[].instanceTemplate field), you must make sure these
fields are compatible with each other and the job. For example, do all the
following:
Make sure all the VM resources that you specify are
available in the location of your job's VMs. For more information, see the
Locations page.
If you specify the
machine type of the job's VMs,
make sure that machine type has enough vCPUs and memory for the job's task
requirements: each task's required vCPUs and memory ( cpuMilli
and memoryMib fields) fields and your preferred maximum
parallel tasks per VM ( taskCountPerNode field).
The number of VMs and the number of tasks that can run simultaneously
on each VM vary for different jobs based on the task scheduling and your
specified hardware requirements. If you specify for a job's tasks to run
IN_ORDER , the job has one VM and only runs one task at a time. Otherwise,
if a job's tasks run AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE , then you can estimate the
number of VMs and the number simultaneous tasks using the following formula:
\[{vmsPerJob}=\frac{taskCount}{parallelTasksPerVm}\]
This formula has the following values:
\({vmsPerJob}\): the maximum number of VMs for a job. The actual amount of VMs
created for a job might be smaller than this—for example, if
Batch expects it's faster to run a job on fewer resources
than to wait for more resources. This value is also limited by the
concurrent VMs per job limits .
\({taskCount}\): the total number of tasks for the job, which you define
using the task count ( taskCount ) field .
\({parallelTasksPerVM}\): the maximum number of tasks that can run on a VM
simultaneously.
This value is determined by all of the following
criteria:
The minimum value is 1 task.
The maximum value is the smaller of 20 tasks and, if defined, the value
of the max parallel tasks per job ( parallelism ) field .
If the
maximum parallel tasks per VM ( taskCountPerNode ) field
is defined, that value is used.
Otherwise, if taskCountPerNode is undefined, Batch
decides a value by dividing the total number of
compute resources—specifically vCPUs—per VM into the amount
required for each task:
\[{parallelTasksPerVm}=\frac{vcpusPerVm}{vcpusPerTask}\]
This formula has the following values:
\({vcpusPerVm}\): the total number of vCPUs per VM, which is
determined by the machine type of your job's VMs.
\({vcpusPerTask}\): the number of vCPUs per task, which
is determined by converting the units of the
vCPUs per task ( cpuMilli ) field .
Job creation options
Create and run a basic job explains the
fundamentals, including how to define a runnable using either a script or
container image and how to configure predefined and custom environment variables.
After you understand the fundamentals for job creation, consider creating
a job that uses one or more of the following additional configuration options:
Important: Some options for job creation are not available in the
Google Cloud console. For details, see the documentation for each feature. For
more features and flexibility for creating jobs, use the gcloud CLI
or Batch API instead.
Control access for a job:
Control access for a job using a custom service account
explains how to specify a job's service account, which influences the
resources and applications that a job's VMs can access. If you don't
specify a custom service account, jobs default to using the
Compute Engine default service account .
Networking overview
provides an overview of when and how you can customize the
networking configuration for a job, including specifying the
job's network, blocking external connections, and
protecting data and resources by using VPC Service Controls.
Protect sensitive data using Secret Manager
explains how to securely define sensitive data, such as custom
environment variables and login credentials, by using
Secret Manager secrets to specify encrypted information
when you create a job.
Configure additional options for a job:
Configure task communication using an MPI library
explains how to configure a job with interdependent tasks that communicate
with each other across different VMs by using a Message Passing Interface
(MPI) library. A common use case for MPI is tightly coupled,
high performance computing (HPC) workloads.
Customize the resources that a job runs on:
Define job resources using a VM instance template
explains how to specify a Compute Engine VM template to
define a job's resources when you create a job. This is an
alternative to specifying a job's resources directly by using the
instances[].policy field .
Use GPUs for a job explains how to define
a job that uses one or more graphics processing units (GPUs). Common use
cases for jobs that use GPUs include intensive data processing or machine
learning (ML) workloads.
Use storage volumes for a job explains
how to define a job that can access one or more external storage volumes.
Storage options include new or existing persistent disks, new local SSDs,
existing Cloud Storage buckets, and an existing network file system
(NFS) such as a Filestore file share.
VM OS environment overview
provides an overview of when and how you can customize the
VM operating system (OS) environment for a job, including the job's
VM OS image and boot disks.
Optimize various aspects of a job:
Improve monitoring and analysis:
Write task logs explains how to
configure a job's runnables to write task logs.
Writing task logs lets you surface custom information
in Cloud Logging, which can help make jobs easier to
analyze and troubleshoot.
Configure custom status events
explains how to configure custom status events for a job's
runnables. Custom status events let you describe important
events that happen for runnables and appear when you
view a job's history of status events ,
which can help make jobs easier to analyze and troubleshoot.
Enable status notifications
explains how you can configure a job to send Pub/Sub
notifications about its status, which you can optionally store
and query in a BigQuery table.
Before reading this document, configure your project to
monitor job status using Pub/Sub notifications and BigQuery
first.
Enable Ops Agent metrics
explains how to configure a job to automatically install the Ops
Agent. The Ops Agent collects additional metrics about the
performance and utilization of a job's resources.
For more information about viewing and using resource metrics,
see
Monitor and optimize job resources by viewing metrics .
Schedule dependent jobs
( Preview ) explains how to
specify a job that doesn't run until one or more existing dependency
jobs have succeeded or failed. If you have a workload with varying
resource requirements, you can reduce costs and quota usage by
separating the types of VMs used for low-demand operations
(like data preparation) and compute-intensive operations (like data
processing).
Automate task retries
explains how to automatically retry a job's tasks after all or
specified failures. Automated retries can help reduce
troubleshooting friction and the overall run time
required for jobs that experience temporary errors.
For example, use automatic retries for a job that runs on
Spot VMs, which provide significant discounts but might
not always be available and can be preempted at any time.
Limit run times using timeouts explains
how to limit the amount of time that a task or runnable is permitted
to run. By preventing excess run times, you might reduce unexpected
costs and delays.
Ensure resource availability using VM reservations
explains how to configure a job that
can run on reserved VMs. Using reserved
VMs can help you minimize a job's scheduling time,
prevent resource availability errors, and
optimize costs.
Reduce latency:
Colocate VMs to reduce latency
explains how to reduce network latency between a job's VMs by
requiring the VMs to be located physically close to each other.
This performance benefit can be especially useful for jobs that
have frequent network communications across VMs, such as tasks that
communicate using MPI libraries.
Use Image streaming
explains how to improve job startup time by streaming container
images from Artifact Registry.
Use additional services to create and run jobs:
Orchestrate jobs using Workflows
explains how to use Workflows to execute a job's
tasks in an order that you define using the
Workflows syntax .
Orchestrate jobs using Nextflow explains how to
run a Batch job through a
Nextflow pipeline, which
you can use to orchestrate bioinformatics workflows.
Orchestrate jobs using dsub explains how to
run a Batch job through a
dsub
pipeline, which you can use to orchestrate batch-processing workflows
on Google Cloud services.
Create and run Batch jobs using Terraform and Cloud Scheduler
explains how to incorporate Batch jobs into Terraform.
Terraform
lets you provision and manage infrastructure by specifying the preferred
state in configuration files, which can be treated as code and stored in
version control systems like GitHub.
