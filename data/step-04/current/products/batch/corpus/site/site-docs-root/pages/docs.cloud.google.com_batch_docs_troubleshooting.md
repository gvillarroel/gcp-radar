Job creation errors
If you can't create a job, it might be due to one of the errors in this section.
Insufficient quota
Issue
One of the following issues occurs when you try to create a job:
When the job is in the
QUEUED state ,
the following issue appears in the
statusEvents field :
Quota checking process decides to delay scheduling for the job JOB_UID due to inadequate quotas [Quota: QUOTA_NAME , limit: QUOTA_LIMIT , usage: QUOTA_CURRENT_USAGE , wanted: WANTED_QUOTA .].
This issue indicates that the job has been delayed because the
current usage ( QUOTA_USAGE ) and limit
( QUOTA_LIMIT )
of QUOTA_NAME quota prevented the job's
requested usage ( WANT_QUOTA ).
When the job is in
QUEUED , SCHEDULED , or FAILED states ,
one of the following issues appears in the
statusEvents field :
RESOURCE_NAME creation failed:
Quota QUOTA_NAME exceeded. Limit: QUOTA_LIMIT in region REGION
RESOURCE_NAME creation failed:
Quota QUOTA_NAME exceeded. Limit: QUOTA_LIMIT in zone ZONE
This issue indicates that creating a resource failed because the
request exceeded your QUOTA_NAME quota, which
has a limit of QUOTA_LIMIT in the
specified location.
Solution
To resolve the issue, do the following:
If the job was delayed, try to wait for more quota to be released.
If the job failed due to insufficient quota or if these delays persist,
try to prevent insufficient quota by doing any of the following:
Create jobs that use less of that quota or a different quota.
For example, specify a different allowed location or resource type for
the job, or split your quota usage across additional projects.
Request a higher quota limit for your project from Google Cloud.
For more information, see
Batch quotas and limits and
Work with quotas .
Insufficient permissions to act as the service account
Issue
The following issue occurs when you try to create a job:
If the job does not use an instance template, the issue appears as the following:
caller does not have access to act as the specified service account: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
If the job uses an instance template, the issue appears as the following:
Error: code - CODE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MISMATCH, description - The service account specified in the instance template INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT doesn't match the service account specified in the job JOB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT for JOB_UID , project PROJECT_NUMBER
This issue usually occurs because the user creating the job does not have
sufficient permissions to act as the service account used by the job,
which is controlled by the
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission .
Solution
To resolve the issue, do the following:
If the job uses an instance template, verify that the service account
specified in the instance template matches the service account
specified in the job's definition.
Make sure that the user who is creating the job has been granted
Service Account User role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser )
on the service account specified for the job. For more information, see
Manage access .
Recreate the job.
Repeated networks
Issue
The following issue occurs when you try to create a job:
Networks must be distinct for NICs in the same InstanceTemplate
This issue occurs because you specified the network for a job more than once.
Solution
To resolve the issue, recreate the job and specify the network by using
one of the following options:
VM instance template: If you want to
use a VM instance template while creating this job ,
you must specify the network in the VM instance template.
network and subnetwork fields :
These fields can be used in the request body when you create a job using the
Batch API or in the JSON configuration file when you create
a job using the gcloud CLI.
--network and --subnetwork flags :
These flags can be used with the gcloud batch jobs submit command
when you create a job using the gcloud CLI.
For more information, see
Specify the network for a job .
Invalid network for VPC Service Controls
Issue
The following issue occurs when you try to create a job:
no_external_ip_address field is invalid. VPC Service Controls is enabled for the project, so external ip address must be disabled for the job. Please set no_external_ip_address field to be true
Solution
This issue occurs because you are attempting to create and run a job with VMs
that have external IP addresses in a VPC Service Controls service perimeter.
To resolve the issue,
create a job that blocks external access for all VMs .
For more information about how to configure networking for a job in a
VPC Service Controls service perimeter,
see Use VPC Service Controls with Batch .
Job issues and failure errors
If you have issues with a job that is not running correctly or failed for
unclear reasons, it might be due to one of the errors in this section
or one of the exit codes in the following
Task failure exit codes section.
No logs in Cloud Logging
Issue
You need to debug a job, but no logs appear for the job in
Cloud Logging.
This issue often occurs for the following reasons:
The Cloud Logging API is not enabled for your project.
Even if you correctly configure everything else for a job's logs,
it won't produce logs if the service is not enabled for
your project.
The job's service account does not have permission to write
logs. A job can't produce logs without sufficient permissions.
The job was not configured to produce logs. To produce logs in
Cloud Logging, a job needs to have Cloud Logging enabled. The job's
runnables should also be configured to write any information that you want to
appear in logs to the standard output (stdout) and
standard error (stderr) streams. For more information, see
Analyze a job by using logs .
Tasks did not run. Logs cannot be produced until tasks have been
assigned resources and start running.
Cloud Logging was configured to automatically exclude the job's logs.
Logs from Batch jobs can't appear if you have configured
exclusion filters for Cloud Logging
that cause logs from Batch jobs to be excluded.
Solution
To resolve this issue, do the following:
Make sure that the logs weren't automatically excluded from Cloud Logging
by disabling any current
exclusion filters for Cloud Logging .
Make sure that the Cloud Logging API is enabled for your project .
Make sure the service account for the job has the
Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) IAM role.
For more information, see
Enable Batch for a project .
View the details of the job using the gcloud CLI or Batch API .
The job details can help you understand why the job did not
produce logs and might provide information that you hoped to get
from logs. For example, do the following:
To verify that logging is enabled, review the job's
logsPolicy field .
To verify that the job finished running successfully, review the job's
status field .
After you've made any changes, recreate the job and wait for the job to
finish running before checking for logs.
No service agent reporting
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a job that is not running properly or failed before VMs were created:
No VM has agent reporting correctly within time window NUMBER_OF_SECONDS seconds, VM state for instance VM_NAME is TIMESTAMP ,agent,start
The issue indicates that none of a job's VMs are reporting to the
Batch service agent .
This issue often occurs for the following reasons:
The job's VMs do not have sufficient permissions.
A job's VMs require specific permissions to report their state to the
Batch service agent. You can provide these permissions
for a job's VMs by granting the
Batch Agent Reporter role ( roles/batch.agentReporter )
to the job's service account.
The job's VMs have network issues. A job's VMs require network
access to communicate with the Batch service agent.
The job's VMs are using an outdated Batch VM OS image or using a VM OS image
with outdated Batch service agent software.
The job's VMs require software in its VM OS image that provides the
current dependencies for reporting to the
Batch service agent.
Solution
To resolve the issue, do the following:
Verify that the job's VMs have the permissions required to report their state
to the Batch service agent.
To identify the job's service account,
view the details of the job using the gcloud CLI or Batch API .
If no service account is listed, the job uses the Compute Engine
default service account by default.
Confirm that the job's service account has permissions for the
Batch Agent Reporter role
( roles/batch.agentReporter ). For more information, see
Manage access and
Restricting service account usage .
For example, to grant the
Compute Engine default service account the required permissions,
use the following command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role roles/batch.agentReporter \
--member serviceAccount: PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with your project number
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID
Verify that the job's VMs have proper network access.
For more information, see
Batch networking overview and
Troubleshoot common networking issues .
If you specified the VM OS image for the job, verify that the
VM OS image is currently supported.
If you enabled Cloud Logging for the job, you can
identify this issue by checking for any of the following
agent logs ( batch_agent_logs ). For more information, see
Analyze a job using logs .
Log for outdated Batch service agent software error:
rpc error: code = FailedPrecondition, desc = Invalid resource state for BATCH_AGENT_VERSION : outdated Batch agent version used.
The BATCH_AGENT_VERSION is the version of software for
communicating with the Batch service agent that the
job uses—for example, cloud-batch-agent_20221103.00_p00 .
Log for outdated Batch VM OS image error:
rpc error: code = FailedPrecondition, desc = Invalid resource state for BATCH_VM_OS_IMAGE_NAME : outdated Batch image version.
The BATCH_VM_OS_IMAGE_NAME is the specific version of a
VM OS image from Batch that the job uses—for example, batch-debian-11-20220909-00-p00 .
You can resolve this issue by using a newer VM OS image.
If the job uses a custom image, recreate the custom image based on one
of the latest version of a supported public image.
For more information, see Supported VM OS images
and View VM OS images .
Recreate the job.
Missing resource metrics in Cloud Monitoring
Issue
You want to
view resource metrics for a job ,
but some or all of the expected metrics are missing.
This issue often occurs for the following reasons:
The API wasn't enabled for your project.
Even if you correctly configure everything else in your project, resource
metrics might not appear until the Cloud Monitoring API is enabled.
For the Ops Agent, you must also enable the Cloud Logging API.
You don't have sufficient permissions to view the metrics. You can't
view metrics without sufficient permissions.
The job's VMs didn't run. Metrics can't be produced for a job
until at least one of the job's VMs is running.
The job's configuration or permissions didn't support Ops Agent metrics.
Some resource metrics can be provided only by the Ops Agent. To support Ops
Agent metrics, a job must meet the requirements for the Ops Agent, install
the Ops Agent, and use a service account that can write metrics to
Monitoring.
You need to use a different method or filter to view the metrics.
Some methods for viewing metrics don't display metrics for VMs after the VMs
are deleted. Additionally, metrics won't appear if they are omitted by filters
or the displayed time period. Furthermore, metric graphs have adjustable
resolutions that can cause small amounts of data to be too thin to display.
The metrics were deleted. You cannot view metrics after they are deleted,
which happens automatically after the Monitoring retention
periods.
Solution
If only Ops Agent metrics are missing, first try to resolve the issue by do the
following:
Verify the job's configuration by doing the following:
To see the job's complete configuration information,
view the details of the job using the gcloud CLI or Batch API . Use the output
for the remaining steps.
Ensure that the job's service account has the
permissions to write Ops Agent metrics .
Ensure that the job meets all the
Ops Agent requirements .
Ensure that the job correctly installs the Ops Agent. Although it's
possible to install the Ops Agent manually in a runnable, the
recommended method is to automatically install the Ops Agent by
setting the
installOpsAgent field
to true .
If the issue still persists, see
Troubleshoot the Ops Agent
in the Google Cloud Observability documentation.
Otherwise, resolve the issue by doing the following:
Ensure that the Monitoring API is enabled for your project:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Ensure that job's VMs started running and that the run time is still
within the
Monitoring retention periods .
You can see the job's run time by
viewing the details of the job .
Verify that there aren't any issues with the methods you are using to view
metrics by doing the following:
Unless you want to see metrics for only running resources, ensure that
you are viewing metrics by using the Metrics Explorer or a custom
dashboard made from Metrics Explorer charts. Other methods, such
as Compute Engine dashboards, don't display metrics for resources
that have been deleted.
Ensure that the
display period
includes the job's run time. For graphs, also ensure that the
graph resolution
is appropriate for your data.
Ensure that you don't have any
filters
that are hiding the data.
If the issue still persists, see the
Troubleshoot Cloud Monitoring
pages in the Google Cloud Observability documentation.
Constraint violated for VM external IP addresses
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a failed job:
Instance VM_NAME creation failed: Constraint constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess violated for project PROJECT_NUMBER .
Add instance VM_NAME to the constraint to use external IP with it.
This issue occurs because your project, folder, or organization has set the
compute.vmExternalIpAccess organizational policy constraint
so that only allowlisted VMs can use external IP addresses.
Solution
To resolve the issue, recreate the job and do one of the following:
Use a project that is exempt from the constraint .
Create a job that blocks external access for all VMs .
Constraint violated for trusted images
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a failed job:
Instance VM_NAME creation failed: Constraint constraints/compute.trustedImageProjects violated for project PROJECT_ID . Use of images from project batch-custom-image is prohibited.
Solution
This issue occurs because your project has set the
trusted images ( compute.trustedImageProjects ) policy constraint
so that images from Batch, which are in the
batch-custom-image images project, are not allowed.
To resolve the issue, do at least one of the following:
Recreate the job to specify a VM OS image
that is already allowed by the trusted images policy constraint.
Ask your administrator to allow the modify the
trusted image policy constraint to allow VM OS images from the
batch-custom-image images project. For instructions, see
Control access to VM OS images for Batch .
Job failed while using an instance template
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a failed job that uses an instance template:
INVALID_FIELD_VALUE,BACKEND_ERROR
This issue occurs due to unclear problems with the job's instance template.
Solution
To debug the issue further, do the following:
Create a MIG using the instance template
and observe if errors occur with more details.
Optional: To try to find more information, see the
long running operation
that is creating the MIG in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Compute Engine Operations
Task failure exit codes
When a specific task in a job fails, the task returns a nonzero
exit code .
Depending on how you configure the
ignoreExitStatus field ,
a failed task might or might not cause a job to fail.
In addition to any exit codes that you define in a runnable, a
Batch has several reserved exit codes, including the
following exit codes.
VM preemption (50001)
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a job:
Task state is updated from PRE-STATE to FAILED on zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_ID due to Spot Preemption with exit code 50001.
This issue occurs when a Spot VM for the job
is preempted during run time.
Solution
To resolve the issue, do one of the following:
Retry the task either by using
automated task retries
or manually re-running the job.
To guarantee there is no preemption, use VMs with the
standard provisioning model instead.
VM reporting timeout (50002)
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a job:
Task state is updated from PRE-STATE to FAILED on zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_ID due to Batch no longer receives VM updates with exit code 50002.
This issue occurs when there is a timeout in the backend that caused
Batch to no longer receive updates from a VM for the job.
Unfortunately, many hardware failures or software failures can cause a VM to
be unresponsive—for example, a VM might crash due to a temporary host
event or
insufficient resources .
Solution
To resolve this issue, do the following:
In case the issue is temporary and resolves itself, retry the task either by
using automated task retries or manually
re-running the job.
If the issue persists, identify and resolve what is causing the VM to be
unresponsive by doing one or more of the following:
Recommended: Get support through
Google Cloud Support or the
Batch label on Cloud Forums .
Try to identify and resolve the issue yourself. For example, if you are
familiar with Compute Engine, you can try to troubleshoot the
job's VMs by doing the following:
To identify the names of your job's VMs, do the following:
View logs for the job .
Filter logs for
entries that contain phrase report agent state: .
Review the logs to determine the VM for each attempt of
each task. Each log is similar to the following, in which there is
one instance: phrase and one or more task_id: phrases.
report agent state: ... instance:" INSTANCE_NAME " ... task_id:"task/ JOB_UID -group0- TASK_INDEX / TASK_RETRIES /0 ..."
This log includes the following values:
INSTANCE_NAME : The name of the VM.
JOB_UID : The unique ID (UID) of the job.
TASK_INDEX : The index of the task.
TASK_RETRIES : The attempt of the task
that ran on this VM, which is formatted as the number of retries.
For example, this value is 0 for the first attempt of a task.
Each task is only attempted once unless you enable
automated task retries .
Troubleshoot your job's VMs using the Compute Engine
documentation. For example, see
Troubleshooting VM shutdowns and reboots
and
Troubleshooting VM startup .
VM rebooted during execution (50003)
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a job:
Task state is updated from PRE-STATE to FAILED on zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_ID due to VM is rebooted during task execution with exit code 50003.
This issue occurs when a VM for a job unexpectedly reboots during run time.
Solution
To resolve this issue, retry the task either by using
automated task retries
or manually re-running the job.
VM and task are unresponsive (50004)
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a job:
Task state is updated from PRE-STATE to FAILED on zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_ID due to tasks cannot be canceled with exit code 50004.
This issue occurs when a task reaches the unresponsive time limit and cannot be cancelled.
Solution
To resolve this issue, retry the task either by using
automated task retries
or manually re-running the job.
Task runs over the maximum runtime (50005)
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a job:
Task state is updated from PRE-STATE to FAILED on zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_ID due to task runs over the maximum runtime with exit code 50005.
This issue occurs in the following cases:
A task's run time exceeds the time limit specified in the
maxRunDuration field
A runnable's run time exceeds the time limit specified in the
timeout field
To identify specifically which time limit was exceeded,
view logs for the job
and find a log that mentions the 50005 exit code. This textPayload field
of this log indicates where and when the time limit was exceeded.
Important: Due to a known issue, the logs generated by Batch
for exceeded timeout don't indicate whether the task's timeout or
the runnable's timeout was exceeded. For a workaround that explains how to
identify which timeout was exceeded, see the
known issue .
Solution
To resolve the issue, attempt to verify the total run time required by
the task or runnable that exceeded the time limit.
Then, do one of the following:
If you only occasionally expect this error, such as for a task or runnable
with an inconsistent run time, you can try to recreate the job and configure
it to automate task retries
to try to increase the success rate.
Otherwise, if the task or runnable consistently and intentionally needs
more time to finish running than the current timeout allows,
set a longer timeout .
VM recreated during execution (50006)
Issue
The following issue appears in the
statusEvents field
for a job:
Task state is updated from PRE-STATE to FAILED on zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_ID due to VM is recreated during task execution with exit code 50006.
This issue occurs when a VM for a job is unexpectedly recreated during run time.
Solution
To resolve this issue, retry the task either by using
automated task retries
or manually re-running the job.
