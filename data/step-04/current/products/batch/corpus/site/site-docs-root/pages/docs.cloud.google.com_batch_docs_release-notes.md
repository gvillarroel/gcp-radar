Change
Dynamic Workload Scheduler for Batch
( Preview ) has
been replaced with the following consumption options:
Flex-start VMs
( Preview ) : We
recommend Flex-start VMs if your job can withstand best-effort
availability in exchange for discounted pricing and up to 7 days to finish
running.
Calendar-mode reservations
( Preview ) : We
recommend calendar-mode reservations if your job needs a very high level of
assurance of resource availability for at least 1 day and up to 90 days.
Both consumption options use
Dynamic Workload Scheduler pricing ,
which offers discounts of up to 53% off of on-demand pricing.
For more information, see Create and run a job that uses GPUs .
Change
Documentation has been updated to clarify the
machine types that jobs can use .
July 24, 2025
Issue
Pub/Sub might not send notifications for all intermediate states when a job or task changes very quickly. You can mitigate this issue by viewing state history through status events. For more information, see
Known issues .
March 10, 2025
Feature
Cancelling jobs is generally available ( GA ).
January 07, 2025
Feature
You can use the Google Cloud console to create jobs that use GPUs .
November 14, 2024
Feature
Dependent jobs are available in Preview . Dependent jobs let you schedule an automated chain of jobs, which can help you optimize resource consumption—for example, separate the types of VMs used for data preparation and compute-intensive data processing.
October 28, 2024
Feature
Dynamic Workload Scheduler for Batch is available in Preview. We recommend using Dynamic Workload Scheduler to improve resource availability for jobs that run on A3 GPU VMs when you don't intend to use a reservation. For more information, see Create and run a job that uses GPUs .
August 16, 2024
Change
Documentation has been added to explain how to export job information. Exporting a job's information is useful when you want to retain the information after a job is deleted or analyze the information outside of Batch. For more information, see Export job information .
August 13, 2024
Change
The documentation has been updated to clarify that a Batch OS stops being supported when its base Compute Engine OS is deprecated. This restriction only applies to Batch OSes that have not already reached the end of development as of the date of this notice.
For more information, see Restrictions for VM OS images .
Deprecated
Batch CentOS ( batch-centos ) and Batch HPC CentOS ( batch-hpc-centos ) have reached end of development due to the end of support (EOS) of Compute Engine CentOS 7 images on June 30, 2024 .
The final image versions of these Batch OSes— batch-centos-7-official-20240628-00-p00 and batch-hpc-centos-7-official-20240628-00-p00 from June 28, 2024—are only supported until August 27, 2024. By then, migrate any job that uses Batch CentOS or Batch HPC CentOS to a different OS.
Feature
Cancel jobs is available in Preview.
June 17, 2024
Change
Documentation has been added to explain how to view resource metrics for your jobs in Cloud Monitoring. The metrics provide resource utilization and performance information, which you can use to help optimize the performance and costs of future jobs.
For more information, see Monitor and optimize job resources by viewing metrics .
Feature
You can configure a job to automatically install the Ops Agent, which provides additional resource metrics in Cloud Monitoring. For more information, see Collect additional resource metrics using the Ops Agent .
April 03, 2024
Issue
When a job fails due to exceeding a timeout, the job's logs don't indicate whether the failure was caused by the relevant task's timeout or the relevant runnable's timeout. For more information, including a workaround, see Known issues .
Feature
You can set maximum time limits for tasks and runnables. For more information, see Limit run times for tasks and runnables using timeouts .
February 22, 2024
Change
In the Google Cloud console, the Job list page has been updated to reduce latency. Although the console no longer summarizes the statuses of your jobs, you can filter based on job state when you view a list of your jobs .
Fixed
Fixed the issue causing latency when listing jobs in projects that contain more than 10,000 jobs.
February 01, 2024
Feature
You can configure custom status events, which describe important events for a job's runnables. By providing additional information about a job's progress, custom status events can help make a job easier to analyze and troubleshoot.
For more information, see Configure custom status events to describe runnables and View a job's history through status events .
Feature
You can run Batch jobs as a non-root user to meet workload or security requirements. For more information, see Create and run jobs as a non-root user .
Feature
You can write unstructured and structured task logs:
An unstructured task log lets you define a log's message.
A structured task log lets you define multiple details for a log such as the message, the severity, custom fields, and a custom status event.
By allowing you to surface custom information in Cloud Logging, task logs can help make a job easier to analyze and troubleshoot.
For more information, see Write task logs .
January 25, 2024
Issue
Jobs that try to consume reserved VMs might be incorrectly delayed or prevented from running. For more information, including workarounds, see Known issues .
January 02, 2024
Change
The limit for concurrent VMs per job now varies based on the number of zones allowed for a job's VMs:
The limit for concurrent VMs per single-zone job remains 2,000.
The limit for concurrent VMs per multi-zone job has increased to 4,000.
Learn more about Quotas and limits and Batch locations .
December 21, 2023
Feature
You can use Image streaming to enable Batch jobs to initialize without waiting for a container image to finish downloading. For more information, see Use Image streaming to reduce container startup time .
December 20, 2023
Breaking
Logs from Batch jobs created after December 19, 2023 will no longer use the general-purpose generic_task monitored resource type and instead use the new batch.googleapis.com/Job monitored resource type. The batch.googleapis.com/Job monitored resource type is specific to Batch, which makes it simpler to query Cloud Logging for logs only from Batch.
When querying Cloud Logging for logs from Batch, update any filters that require the generic_task monitored resource type to specify the batch.googleapis.com/Job monitored resource type accordingly. Alternatively, you can enable the use_generic_task_monitored_resource field for your jobs to continue using the generic_task monitored resource type instead.
For more information, see the documentation for Cloud Logging monitored resources types and Batch job logs .
November 27, 2023
Change
