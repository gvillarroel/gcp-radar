Building a Node.js application
Stay organized with collections

Specify versions of Node.js
The buildpacks project provides support for the Current and Active LTS
releases of Node.js. Older releases of Node.js are available but might not be
actively maintained by the project.
Use package.json
You can specify the Node.js version of your application during deployment
by configuring the engines.node field in the package.json file. To configure
the buildpack to use the latest version of Node.js when deploying your app, add the following values in your package.json :
"engines" : {
"node" : "24.x.x"
}
Use GOOGLE_NODEJS_VERSION
You can also specify the Node.js version using the GOOGLE_NODEJS_VERSION
environment variable.
If both configurations are set, the GOOGLE_NODEJS_VERSION value takes precedence
over the engines.node property. If you don't provide a version, then the
buildpack uses the most recent LTS version of Node.js.
To configure the buildpack to use Node.js 24 when deploying
your app, run the following command:
pack build --builder=gcr.io/buildpacks/builder \
sample-functions-framework-node \
--env GOOGLE_NODEJS_VERSION=24.x.x
You can also use a project.toml project descriptor to encode
the environment variable alongside your project files. See instructions on
building the application with environment variables .
Tips
engines.node field can take a semver constraint. The specific library we use for the Node.js buildpacks is Masterminds/semver
Avoid using greater than (>) specifiers in the engines.node field.
When deploying the application into App Engine standard environment, the engines.node property should be compatible with the runtime specified in app.yaml . For more information about the engines.node configuration option in package.json file, see the official NPM documentation for the engines topic .
When deploying a function onto Cloud Run functions, the engines.node property should be compatible with the runtime used to deploy your function
Install dependencies
NPM is the default package manager for all versions of Node.js. The following section
includes the compatible dependencies for your Node.js applications.
NPM package manager
NPM is the default package manager.
Whenever possible, use package-lock.json to improve cache performance.
By default only production dependencies are installed.
Specify the npm version using the engines.npm field in your
package.json file. For more information, see the NPM documentation.
Yarn package manager
buildpack uses Yarn when you include the yarn.lock file in your project.
Specify the yarn version in the engines.yarn field of your
package.json file.
buildpack supports Yarn2 PnP mode if your project includes a .yarn/cache folder.
Pnpm package manager
buildpack uses Pnpm when you include the pnpm-lock.yaml file in your
project.
Specify pnpm version in the engines.pnpm field of your
package.json file.
For a working example, see sample-node-pnpm .
Bun package manager
The Node.js buildpack supports the Bun package manager,
google.nodejs.bun buildpack for installing dependencies. To use the Bun package
manager, follow these steps:
Create a bun.lock or bun.lockb file in the root
directory for automatic detection.
Alternatively, you can also explicitly set the GOOGLE_PACKAGE_MANAGER
environment variable to bun . With this method, you don't need to create and
maintain lockfiles.
Your project must include a package.json file. You can specify a Bun
version in the engines.bun or packageManager field of your
package.json file. If no version is specified, the
buildpack defaults to the latest stable release.
For more information on deploying to Cloud Run, see Specify dependencies in Node.js .
For more information about the Bun package manager, see the Bun
documentation .
Package manager precedence
The Node.js buildpack determines the package manager based on the configuration in the following order of precedence:
The buildpack first checks for lockfiles in the following order:
Yarn - yarn.lock
pnpm - pnpm-lock.yaml
Bun - bun.lock or bun.lockb
NPM - package-lock.json
If you don't use lockfiles, the Node.js buildpack uses
the value you assign the GOOGLE_PACKAGE_MANAGER
environment variable.
If you don't use a lockfile or set the environment variable, the buildpack defaults to using NPM.
Private modules
Use a private npm module by providing settings for authenticating with
the registry in a .npmrc file in the function's directory. If you're using
Yarn version 2 or later as your package manager, this file is named
.yarnrc.yml .
Private modules from Artifact Registry
An Artifact Registry Node.js package repository
can host private modules for your function. When you deploy a Buildpacks
function, the build process automatically generates Artifact Registry credentials
for the Cloud Build service account .
You only need to list the Artifact Registry repository in your .npmrc file
when using NPM or Yarn version 1. For example, when using NPM or Yarn version 1:
@ SCOPE : registry = https : // REGION_ID -npm.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME
// REGION_ID -npm.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME :always-auth=true
If you're using Yarn version 2 or later, you only need to list the Artifact Registry
repository in your .yarnrc.yml file without additional credentials.
For example:
npmScopes:
SCOPE :
npmRegistryServer: https:// REGION_ID -npm.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME
npmAlwaysAuth: true
Private modules from other repositories
The npm documentation explains how to create custom read-only
access tokens. We discourage using the .npmrc file created in the home
directory because it contains a read-write token. Write permissions are not
required during deployment, and could pose a security risk.
Don't include the .npmrc file if you're not using private repositories,
as it can increase the deployment time for your functions.
Note: If you're using any custom permissions (such as those necessary for
VPC ), make sure that you explicitly
allow your functions to access the target private repository.
File format
If you're using an .npmrc file to set a custom auth token, include the following:
// REGISTRY_DOMAIN /:_authToken= AUTH_TOKEN
Replace:
REGISTRY_DOMAIN : the domain name of your private
npm registry. For example if your repository host is npmjs.org , set this field
to registry.npmjs.org .
AUTH_TOKEN : the authorization token for your npm registry.
This can either be the literal text value of the token or the text string
${NPM_TOKEN} , which the npm command replaces with the actual token value from the
environment.
You can set the $NPM_TOKEN environment variable with the
--set-build-env-vars
argument to your
gcloud functions deploy command.
See the NPM tutorial on private modules
for more details of the NPM auth token.
Execute custom build steps during deployment
By default, npm run build is run if a script is specified in your
package.json file. However, you can instead specify custom build steps to
override the default behavior and run only the scripts that you want
during the build. You can control the build steps by using either the
GOOGLE_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS environment variable or gcp-build in your
package.json file.
You can only use one method. Note that the GOOGLE_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS
environment variable takes precedence and overrides anything that is specified
for gcp-build in your package.json .
By default, when you configure custom build steps, both the dependencies and
devDependencies in your package.json file are installed first
before any scripts or commands are executed. To override the default behavior,
you can use the NODE_ENV environment variable.
Use GOOGLE_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS
You can pass the GOOGLE_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS environment variable to the build to
control what scripts run. You can specify one or more scripts, or instead
pass an empty environment variable to prevent the default behavior from
running, like GOOGLE_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS= . For complete details, see
Environment variables .
Use package.json
Adding gcp-build in your package.json file only runs
npm run gcp-build , meaning that it overrides the default
behavior. You can specify one or more commands, or instead specify an
empty string to prevent any command from running, like "gcp-build":"" .
"scripts" : {
...
"gcp-build" : "npm run lint && npm run build"
...
}
Application entrypoint
The Node.js buildpack executes the command you specify in the
scripts.start field of your package.json file. If you don't configure the
scripts.start field, the buildpack runs the npm start command.
We recommend using a Procfile because it takes the package manager out of the path
and allows for direct execution.
Environment variables
You can set environment variables to configure builds of your container image.
The Node.js buildpack supports the following environment
variables to customize your container.
NODE_ENV
Specifies the development environment during the build; set for npm install .
Example: NODE_ENV=development installs both the dependencies and devDependencies specified in package.json .
NPM_CONFIG_<key>
Specifies the configuration parameter, for example, NPM_CONFIG_FLAG=value
passes -flag=value to npm commands.
For information about this environment variable, see Config in the NPM documentation.
GOOGLE_PACKAGE_MANAGER
You can configure this environment variable to use a supported package manager . For example,
GOOGLE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=bun forces the use of Bun even if you don't create a
lockfile. This variable supports values such as, npm , yarn , pnpm , or bun .
GOOGLE_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS
Specifies an ordered list of npm scripts from package.json to run after
installing dependencies. The list must be comma-separated and runs in the order
that you list each script.
When you specify GOOGLE_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS , only the scripts that you list are
run. For example, if you want to prevent the default npm run build from
running, specify the environment variable without a value.
Examples:
GOOGLE_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS=lint,build runs npm run lint and then npm run build .
GOOGLE_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS= runs no scripts.
