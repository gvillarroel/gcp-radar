Note: You can't use the latest version of dev_appserver.py to locally run your
applications for runtimes that reached end of support .
The Google Cloud CLI includes a local development server
( dev_appserver.py ). You can use the local development server to simulate
running your App Engine application in production as well as use it to
access App Engine legacy bundled services. The simulated environment enforces some sandbox
restrictions, such as restricted system functions and runtime language module
imports, but not others, like request timeouts or quotas.
The local development server also simulates the services provided by the
libraries in the SDK for App Engine, including Datastore, Memcache, and
Task Queues, by performing their tasks locally. When your application is
running in the development server, you can still make remote API calls to the
production infrastructure by using the Google API HTTP endpoints.
Set up the local development server
Note: The dev_appserver tool does not support development of Python 3 apps on
Windows.
To run the local development server tool, you must set up the following:
Verify that you have installed a Python 3 interpreter that is
compatible with the Python version required by the gcloud CLI .
Verify that you have installed the Google Cloud CLI component that includes the App Engine extension for Python 3 ( app-engine-python ):
gcloud components list
If the app-engine-python component is not installed, run the following
command:
gcloud components install app-engine-python
Locate the installation path of Google Cloud SDK by running the following
command:
gcloud info
The command returns the root directory where you installed Google Cloud SDK, for
example:
Installation Root: [/Users/myname/google-cloud-sdk]
Locate the dev_appserver.py tool under the /bin/ folder where you
installed Google Cloud CLI, for example:
CLOUD_SDK_ROOT /bin/dev_appserver.py
Note the path to the dev_appserver.py for later.
Run the local development server
After setting up the local development server and creating the
app.yaml configuration file for
your app, you can use the dev_appserver.py command to run your app locally.
To start the local development server:
In the directory that contains your app.yaml configuration file, run the
dev_appserver.py command.
Specify the directory path to your app, for example:
python3 CLOUD_SDK_ROOT / bin / dev_appserver . py [ PATH_TO_YOUR_APP ]
Alternatively, you can specify the configuration file of a specific
service, for example:
python3 CLOUD_SDK_ROOT /bin/dev_appserver.py app.yaml
To change the port, you include the --port option:
python3 CLOUD_SDK_ROOT / bin / dev_appserver . py --port=9999 [PATH_TO_YOUR_APP]
The local development server is now running and listening for requests. You
can visit http://localhost:8080/ in your web
browser to see the app in action.
If you specified a custom port with the --port option, remember to open
your browser to that port.
To stop the local server from the command line, press the following:
macOS or Linux: Control+C
Windows: Control+Break
Specify application IDs
To access your App ID in the local server, for example to spoof an email
address, use the get_application_id() function.
To get the hostname of the running app, use the get_default_version_hostname() function.
Detect application runtime environment
To determine whether your code is running in production or in the local
development server, you can check the value of the GAE_ENV environment
variable:
if os.getenv('GAE_ENV', '').startswith('standard'):
# Production in the standard environment
else:
# Local development server
Use the Mail service
The local development server can send email for calls to the App Engine
mail service using either an SMTP server or a local installation of
Sendmail .
Using SMTP
To enable mail support with an SMTP server, invoke dev_appserver.py as
follows::
python3 [ CLOUD_SDK_ROOT ]/ bin / dev_appserver . py --smtp_host=smtp.example.com --smtp_port=25 \
--smtp_user=ajohnson --smtp_password=k1tt3ns [PATH_TO_YOUR_APP]
where you set the --smtp_host , --smtp_port , --smtp_user and
--smtp_password options with your own values.
Using Sendmail
To enable mail support with Sendmail, invoke dev_appserver.py as follows:
python3 [ CLOUD_SDK_ROOT ]/ bin / dev_appserver . py --enable_sendmail=yes [PATH_TO_YOUR_APP]
The local server uses the sendmail command to send email messages with
your installation's default configuration.
Note: If you don't invoke dev_appserver.py with either SMTP or Sendmail as
described, then attempts to send email from your application will do
nothing, but the attempt will appear successful in your application.
Use the URL Fetch service
When your application uses the URL fetch API to make an HTTP request, the
local development server makes the request directly from your computer. The
URL Fetch behavior on the local server may differ from production
App Engine if you use a proxy server for accessing websites.
Use the Users service
App Engine provides a Users service
to simplify authentication and authorization for your application. The local
development server
simulates the behavior of Google Accounts
with its own sign-in and sign-out pages.
While running under the local
development server, the functions return URLs for /_ah/login and /_ah/logout on the local server.
Command-line arguments
