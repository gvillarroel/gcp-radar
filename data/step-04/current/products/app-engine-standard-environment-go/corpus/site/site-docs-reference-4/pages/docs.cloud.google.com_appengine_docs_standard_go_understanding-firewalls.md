Understanding the App Engine firewall
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A firewall determines which network traffic is allowed to pass and which
traffic is rejected. Firewalls can apply to incoming traffic (ingress), outgoing
traffic (egress), or both. For App Engine, the App Engine firewall only
applies to incoming traffic routed to your app or service.
Overview
The App Engine firewall is checked for all types of
requests to your app, including:
Regular web traffic routed to the app's appspot.com address or custom domain.
Requests that arrive from Cloud Load Balancing .
Traffic from internal sources such as Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs) and Cloud Tasks.
In cases where your app is configured to use other networking services or
products, you might need to create rules for controlling incoming traffic in
both the App Engine firewall and the firewall or security settings of other
products. This guide covers the general behavior of the App Engine firewall,
and details about those special use cases.
App Engine firewall rules
You can configure App Engine firewall rules
using the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, or the Admin
API by specifying rules that allow or block specified IP ranges.
By default, any request that does not match a rule is allowed access to your
app. If you need to block all requests that do not match a specific rule
(excluding requests from internal services allowed by default), change the
default rule's action to deny .
Firewall feature
In the App Engine standard environment, the App Engine firewall can allow certain internal
traffic to bypass the firewall. This means that if you set the default rule to
deny , requests from certain services destined for the App Engine standard environment do not
get blocked. These are all types of traffic requested in the app's own
configuration, or sent from the same app. Requests that bypass firewall rules in
this way include:
Warmup requests
Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP (including App Engine Cron )
App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues)
For apps that use the App Engine standard environment and services bundled with the first
generation runtimes , notifications from the
legacy Mail API also bypass the firewall.
Allowing incoming requests from your services
The following table lists the IP ranges and App Engine firewall behavior for
common services. The IP range you use depends on whether the incoming requests
are delivered to a version that runs on the App Engine standard environment or
flexible environment.
Service
IP range for requests sent to the App Engine standard environment
IP range for requests sent to the App Engine flexible environment
App Engine Cron
0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny
0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32
Compute Engine instances with external IP addresses
External IP address of the instance
External IP address of the instance
Compute Engine instances without an external IP address
0.0.0.0/32
0.0.0.0/32
Compute Engine instances without an external IP address using Cloud NAT for outbound connections
0.0.0.0/32
0.0.0.0/32
Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP and App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues)
0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny
0.1.0.2/32
Cloud Storage or Blobstore
0.1.0.30/32
Not applicable
URL Fetch
0.1.0.40/32
0.1.0.40/32
Warming requests
0.1.0.3/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny
Not applicable
Depending on your use case, these additional instructions might apply when
configuring App Engine firewall rules:
Requests from newly created or updated App Engine Cron jobs sent to either the App Engine standard or flexible environment come from 0.1.0.2 . For Cron jobs created with older gcloud versions (earlier than 326.0.0), Cron requests will come from 0.1.0.1 . To learn more about how to identify requests from the App Engine Cron service, see Validating cron requests .
If your app interacts with Cloud Load Balancing or is connected to a VPC network, see the Interaction with other products or services section below.
Caution: Creating a rule for IP 0.0.0.0 will apply to all Compute Engine
instances with Private Google Access enabled, not only the ones you own.
Similarly, allowing requests from 0.1.0.40 will allow any
App Engine app to make URL Fetch requests to your app.
App Engine standard example
Your app running in the standard environment has two services: frontend_service
and backend_service . frontend_service uses Cloud Tasks with
App Engine HTTP to send messages to backend_service . Since the default
firewall rule allows Cloud Tasks requests even if configured to deny , you do not need to create
a firewall rule for Cloud Tasks.
However, if you wanted to restrict access to your app and explicitly block
Cloud Tasks requests, you would create a deny firewall rule for IP range 0.1.0.2/32 .
App Engine flexible example
Your app running in the flexible environment has two services:
frontend_service and backend_service , and has a firewall configured to deny
traffic by default. frontend_service uses Cloud Tasks with
App Engine HTTP to send messages to backend_service . Since the default
firewall rule denies Cloud Tasks requests, you would need to create an
allow firewall rule for 0.1.0.2/32 .
Interaction with other products or services
Cloud Load Balancing
If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless NEGs , note the following:
The load balancer does not interfere or interact with App Engine firewall rules. The App Engine firewall rules are not evaluated until a serverless NEG directs traffic to App Engine.
We recommend that you use ingress controls
so that your app only receives requests sent from the load balancer
(and the VPC if you use it). Otherwise, users can use your app's
App Engine URL to bypass the load balancer, Cloud Armor
security policies, SSL certificates, and private keys that are passed through
the load balancer.
If your ingress controls are set to receive internal-and-cloud-load-balancing traffic, leave the default App Engine firewall rule as is ( allow ), and use Google Cloud Armor web application firewall (WAF) rules .
Preventing access to cached content
The App Engine firewall sits behind mechanisms that cache content, for example
web proxies and browsers. When content is cached, that content is served
publicly from the specific URL until it expires and can be accessed even after
creating new firewall rules.
For information about changing the default expiration time for static content
or preventing static content from being cached, see
Cache expiration .
To prevent dynamic content output from your app's code from being cached, use
the Cache-Control and Expires HTTP response headers. For more information about
these HTTP headers, including how to control caching, see
Avoiding caching .
