Resolve errors
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Google Drive API returns two levels of error information:
HTTP error codes and header messages.
A JSON object in the response body with additional details that can help you
determine how to handle the error.
Google Drive apps should catch and handle all errors that might be encountered
when using the REST API. This guide provides instructions about how to resolve
specific Drive API errors.
HTTP status code summary
Error code
Description
200 - OK
The request is successful (this is the standard response for successful HTTP requests).
400 - Bad Request
The request cannot be fulfilled due to a client error in the request.
401 - Unauthorized
The request contains invalid credentials.
403 - Forbidden
The request was received and understood, but the user doesn't have permission to perform the request.
404 - Not Found
The requested page couldn't be found.
429 - Too Many Requests
Too many requests to the API.
500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors
Unexpected error arises while processing the request.
400 errors
These errors mean that the request was unacceptable, often due to a missing
required parameter.
badRequest
This error can occur from any one of the following issues in your code:
A required field or parameter hasn't been provided.
The value supplied or a combination of provided fields is invalid.
You tried to add a duplicate parent to a Drive file.
You tried to add a parent that would create a cycle in the directory graph.
Note: This list isn't exhaustive, other cases can cause a 400 error.
The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"code" : 400 ,
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"location" : "orderBy" ,
"locationType" : "parameter" ,
"message" : "Sorting is not supported for queries with fullText terms. Results are always in descending relevance order." ,
"reason" : "badRequest"
}
],
"message" : "Sorting is not supported for queries with fullText terms. Results are always in descending relevance order."
}
}
To fix this error, check the message field and adjust your code accordingly.
illegalKeepForeverModification
This error occurs when trying to set a blob file revision marked as "Keep
Forever" to false . The following JSON sample is a representation of this
error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "illegalKeepForeverModification" ,
"message" : "Bad Request. Cannot update a revision to false that is marked as keepForever."
}
],
"code" : 400 ,
"message" : "Bad Request. Cannot update a revision to false that is marked as keepForever."
}
}
To fix this error, permanently delete a blob file revision to remove the "Keep
Forever" setting.
invalidSharingRequest
This error occurs for several reasons. To determine the cause, evaluate the
reason field of the returned JSON. This error most commonly occurs because:
Sharing succeeded, but the notification email wasn't correctly delivered.
The Access Control List (ACL) change isn't allowed for this user.
The message field indicates the actual error.
Share succeeded, but the notification email wasn't correctly delivered
The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "invalidSharingRequest" ,
"message" : "Bad Request. User message: \"Sorry, the items were successfully shared but emails could not be sent to email@domain.com.\""
}
],
"code" : 400 ,
"message" : "Bad Request"
}
}
To fix this error, inform the user (sharer) they were unable to share because
the notification email couldn't be sent to the destination email address. The
user should make sure they have the correct email address and that it can
receive email.
The ACL change isn't allowed for this user
The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "invalidSharingRequest" ,
"message" : "Bad Request. User message: \"ACL change not allowed.\""
}
],
"code" : 400 ,
"message" : "Bad Request"
}
}
To fix this error, check the sharing
settings of the Google Workspace
domain to which the file belongs. The settings might prohibit sharing outside of
the domain or sharing a shared drive might not be permitted.
401 errors
These errors mean the request doesn't contain a valid access token.
authError
This error occurs when the access token that you're using is either expired or
invalid. This error can also be caused by missing authorization for the
requested scopes. The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "authError" ,
"message" : "Invalid Credentials" ,
"locationType" : "header" ,
"location" : "Authorization" ,
}
],
"code" : 401 ,
"message" : "Invalid Credentials"
}
}
To fix this error, refresh the access token using the long-lived refresh token.
If this fails, direct the user through the OAuth flow, as described in Choose
Google Drive API scopes .
fileNotDownloadable
This error occurs when you try to use the revisions.get method with the
alt=media URL parameter on a Google Workspace document. The following JSON
sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "fileNotDownloadable" ,
"message" : "Only files with binary content can be downloaded. Use Export with Docs Editors files."
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "Only files with binary content can be downloaded. Use Export with Docs Editors files."
}
}
To fix this error, try any of the following:
Remove the alt=media URL parameter if you want to view the metadata of a
particular revision, such as the mimetype.
Use the files.export method to export Google Workspace document byte
content. For more information, see Export Google Workspace document
content .
403 errors
These errors mean that a usage limit has been exceeded or the user doesn't have
the correct privileges. To determine the cause, evaluate the reason field of
the returned JSON.
For information about Drive API limits, refer to Usage limits . For information about Drive folder
limits, refer to File and folder limits .
activeItemCreationLimitExceeded
An activeItemCreationLimitExceeded error occurs when the limit for the number
of items created per account has been exceeded. Each user can have up to 500
million items created by an account. For more information, see User-item
limit .
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "activeItemCreationLimitExceeded" ,
"message" : "This account has exceeded the creation limit of 500 million items. To create more items, permanently delete some items."
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "This account has exceeded the creation limit of 500 million items. To create more items, permanently delete some items."
}
}
To fix this error:
Inform the user that Drive prevents accounts from creating
more than 500 million items.
If the user must create items in this same account, instruct them to
permanently delete some objects. Otherwise, they can use a different account
that already meets the requirement.
appNotAuthorizedToFile
This error occurs when your app isn't on the ACL for the file. This error
prevents the user from opening the file with your app. The following JSON sample
is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "appNotAuthorizedToFile" ,
"message" : "The user has not granted the app {appId} {verb} access to the file {fileId}."
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "The user has not granted the app {appId} {verb} access to the file {fileId}."
}
}
To fix this error, try any of the following:
Open the Google Drive picker
and prompt the user to open the file.
Instruct the user to open the file using the Open with context menu in the Drive
UI of your app.
Use the files.get method to check the
isAppAuthorized field on the files resource
to verify that your app created or opened the file.
cannotModifyInheritedTeamDrivePermission
This error occurs when a user tries to modify the inherited permissions of an
item within a shared drive. Inherited permissions can't be removed from an item
in a shared drive. The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "cannotModifyInheritedTeamDrivePermission" ,
"message" : "Cannot update or delete an inherited permission on a shared drive item."
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "Cannot update or delete an inherited permission on a shared drive item."
}
}
To fix this error, a user must adjust the permissions on the direct or indirect
parent item from which they were inherited. For more information, see How
permissions work . You can
also retrieve the permissions resource to
see whether the permissions on this shared drive item are inherited or applied
directly.
dailyLimitExceeded
This error occurs when the API limit for your project was reached. The following
JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "usageLimits" ,
"reason" : "dailyLimitExceeded" ,
"message" : "Daily Limit Exceeded"
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "Daily Limit Exceeded"
}
}
This error appears when the application's owner has set a quota limit to cap
usage of a particular resource. To fix this error, remove any usage caps for
the "Queries per day"
quota .
domainPolicy
This error occurs when the policy for the user's domain doesn't allow access to
Drive by your app. The following JSON sample is a representation
of this error:

edit access. You can also check user access levels in the metadata retrieved by
the files.get method and display a read-only
UI when permissions are missing.
myDriveHierarchyDepthLimitExceeded
A myDriveHierarchyDepthLimitExceeded error occurs when the limit for the
number of nested folder levels has been exceeded. A user's My
Drive can't contain more than 100 levels of nested folders. For
more information, see Folder-depth limit .
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "myDriveHierarchyDepthLimitExceeded" ,
"message" : "Your My Drive can't contain more than 100 levels of folders. For details, see https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/handle-errors#nested-folder-levels."
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "Your My Drive can't contain more than 100 levels of folders. For details, see https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/handle-errors#nested-folder-levels."
}
}

100 levels deep.
If the user must create another nested folder, instruct them to reorganize
the intended parent folder to be fewer than 100 levels deep or use a
different parent folder that already meets the requirement.
numChildrenInNonRootLimitExceeded
This error occurs when the limit for a folder's number of children (folders,
files, and shortcuts) has been exceeded. There's a 500,000 item limit for
folders, files, and shortcuts directly in a folder. Items nested in subfolders
don't count against this 500,000 item limit. For more information on
Drive folder limits, refer to Folder limits in
Google Drive .
The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "numChildrenInNonRootLimitExceeded" ,
"message" : "The limit for this folder's number of children (files and folders) has been exceeded."

}
}
To fix this error, try any of the following:
Inform the user that Drive prevents folders with more than
500,000 items.
If the user must add more items to the full folder, instruct them to
reorganize the folder to contain fewer than 500,000 items or use a similar
folder that already contains fewer items.
rateLimitExceeded
This error occurs when the project's rate limit has been reached. This limit
varies depending on the type of request. The following JSON sample is a
representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "usageLimits" ,
"message" : "Rate Limit Exceeded" ,
"reason" : "rateLimitExceeded" ,
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "Rate Limit Exceeded"
}
}

request a quota increase .
Batch requests to bundle
multiple API calls into one HTTP request.
Use exponential backoff to retry the
request.
sharingRateLimitExceeded
This error occurs when the user reaches a sharing limit and is often linked with
an email limit. The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"message" : "Rate limit exceeded. User message: \"These item(s) could not be shared because a rate limit was exceeded: filename" ,
"reason" : "sharingRateLimitExceeded" ,
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "Rate Limit Exceeded"
}
}
To fix this error:

If one user is making numerous requests on behalf of many users of a
Google Workspace account, consider a service account with domain-wide
delegation using the
quotaUser
parameter .
storageQuotaExceeded
This error occurs when the user reaches their storage limit. The following JSON
sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"message" : "The user's Drive storage quota has been exceeded." ,
"reason" : "storageQuotaExceeded" ,
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "The user's Drive storage quota has been exceeded."
}
}
To fix this error:
Review your Drive account storage limits. For more
information, refer to Google Workspace storage and upload
limits .
Manage your storage in Drive, Gmail &
Google Photos .
Buy more Google storage .
Note: Service accounts don't have storage quota and can't own any files.
Instead, they must upload files and folders into shared drives, or use OAuth 2.0
to upload items on behalf of a human user.
teamDriveFileLimitExceeded
This error occurs when a user attempts to exceed the strict item limit on a
shared drive. Each folder in a user's shared drive has a limit of 500,000 items,
including files, folders, and shortcuts. This limit is based on item count, not
storage use. For more information, see Shared drive limits in
Google Drive .
The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "teamDriveFileLimitExceeded" ,
"message" : "The file limit for this shared drive has been exceeded."
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "The file limit for this shared drive has been exceeded."
}
}
To fix this error, reduce the number of items in the shared drive. Shared drives
with too many files might be difficult to organize and search.
teamDriveHierarchyTooDeep
A teamDriveHierarchyTooDeep error occurs when the limit for the number of
shared drive nested folder levels has been exceeded. A user's shared drive can't
contain more than 100 levels of nested folders. For more information, see
Folder-depth limit .

"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "teamDriveHierarchyTooDeep" ,
"message" : "The shared drive hierarchy depth will exceed the limit."
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "The shared drive hierarchy depth will exceed the limit."
}
}
To fix this error:
Inform the user that shared drives prevents placing folders more than
100 levels deep.
If the user must create another nested folder, instruct them to reorganize
the intended parent folder to be fewer than 100 levels deep or use a
different parent folder that already meets the requirement.
teamDriveMembershipRequired
This error occurs when a user attempts to access a shared drive in which they're
not a member. The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{

"reason" : "teamDriveMembershipRequired" ,
"message" : "The attempted action requires shared drive membership."
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "The attempted action requires shared drive membership."
}
}
To fix this error, try any of the following:
Ask the manager of the shared drive to add you with the appropriate
permissions for the action you must perform.
Review Drive's roles and
permissions to learn who can access and manage
shared drives. Additional information about access levels can also be found
at Create a shared
drive .

}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "Moving folders into shared drives is not supported."
}
}
To fix this error, try any of the following:
Move the individual items from the folder into a shared drive using the
Drive API. Set the supportsAllDrives=true parameter to denote the
support of both My Drive and shared drives.
If you must move the folder into a shared drive, use the
Drive UI. For more information, see Move folders into shared
drives as an admin .
teamDrivesParentLimit
This error occurs when a user attempts to add more than one parent to an item in
a shared drive. The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:
{
"error" : {
"errors" : [
{
"domain" : "global" ,
"reason" : "teamDrivesParentLimit" ,
"message" : "A shared drive item must have exactly one parent."
}
],
"code" : 403 ,
"message" : "A shared drive item must have exactly one parent."
}
}
To fix this error, use Drive shortcuts to add multiple links to a
file. Although a shortcut can only have one parent, a shortcut file can be
copied to the additional locations. For more information, see Create a shortcut
to a Drive file .
UrlLeaseLimitExceeded
This error occurs when trying to save Google Play game data through your
application. The following JSON sample is a representation of this error:

"reason" : "rateLimitExceeded" ,
"message" : "Rate Limit Exceeded"
}
],
"code" : 429 ,
"message" : "Rate Limit Exceeded" s
}
}
To fix this error, use exponential backoff
to retry the request.
500, 502, 503, 504 errors
These errors occur when an unexpected server error arises while processing the
request. Various issues can cause these errors, including a request's timing
overlapping with another request or a request for an unsupported action, such as
attempting to update permissions for a single page in Google Sites instead of
the entire site.
The following is a list of 5xx errors:
500 Backend error
502 Bad Gateway
503 Service Unavailable
504 Gateway Timeout
To fix this error, use exponential backoff
