Implement shared drive support
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Shared drives follow different organization, sharing, and ownership models from
My Drive. If your app is going to create and manage files on
shared drives, you must implement shared drive support in your app. The
complexity of your implementation depends on the functionality of your app.
To begin, you must include the supportsAllDrives=true query parameter in your
requests when your app performs the following operations:
Drive API v3
files.get
files.list
files.create
files.update
files.copy
files.delete
changes.list
changes.getStartPageToken
permissions.list
permissions.get
permissions.create
permissions.update
permissions.delete
Drive API v2
files.get
files.list
files.insert
files.update
files.patch
files.copy
files.trash
files.untrash
files.delete
files.touch
children.insert
parents.insert
changes.list
changes.getStartPageToken
changes.get
permissions.list
permissions.get
permissions.insert
permissions.update
permissions.patch
permissions.delete
The supportsAllDrives=true parameter informs Google Drive that your
application is designed to handle files on shared drives.
Applications that read or modify permissions, track changes, or search across
multiple corpora require additional shared drive capabilities. The remainder of
this document highlights additional changes required to perform these tasks.
Search for content on a shared drive
Use the list method on the files resource to find user files in shared drives. To
search for a shared drive, see Search for shared
drives .
The list method contains the following shared drive-specific query parameters:
driveId : ID of the shared drive to search.
corpora : Bodies of items (files or documents) to which the query applies.
Supported bodies are user , domain , drive , and allDrives . Prefer
user or drive to allDrives for efficiency. By default, corpora is set
to user .
includeItemsFromAllDrives : Whether both My Drive and shared
drive items should be included in results. If not present or set to false,
then shared drive items are not returned.
supportsAllDrives : Whether the requesting application supports both My
Drive and shared drive. If false, shared drive items are not
included in the response.
The following query modes are specific to shared drives:
includeItemsFromAllDrives
corpora
Query description
true
user
Queries files that the user has accessed, including both shared drive and My Drive files.
true
domain
Queries files that are shared to the domain, including both shared drive and My Drive files.
true
drive
Queries all items in the specified shared drive. The driveId must be specified in the request.
true
allDrives
Queries files that the user has accessed and all shared drives in which they're a member. Note that the response might include incompleteSearch:true , indicating that some corpora were not searched for this request.
Track changes on a shared drive
Use the list method on the changes resource to track changes on a shared drive. For
more information, see Track changes for users and shared
drives .
The list method contains the following shared drive-specific query parameters:
driveId : The shared drive from which changes are returned. If specified,
the change IDs refer to changes to items within the shared drive providing
the current state of a file. To refer to a specific shared drive change,
both the shared drive ID and change ID must be used as an identifier.
includeItemsFromAllDrives : Whether shared drive files or changes should be
included in the list of changes.
supportsAllDrives : Whether the requesting application supports shared
drives. If false, then shared drive items, including both shared drives and
files within a shared drive, aren't returned.
The following query modes are specific to shared drives:
includeItemsFromAllDrives
driveId
Query description
true
No
Changes are reflective of changes to files inside or outside of shared drives that the user has accessed, as well as changes to shared drives in which the user is a member.
true
Yes
Changes are reflective of changes to the particular shared drive that was specified and items inside that shared drive.
Note: If you're using the older Drive API v2, the get and
list methods have several parameters
specific to shared drives.
For additional details about change log behavior, see Track changes for users
and shared drives .
Enable shared drive support in the Drive UI
To access shared drive content using the Drive UI, make sure you
have checked the
Shared drives support box on the Drive UI integration tab
of the Google Drive API in the
Google Cloud console . For more
information, see Configure a Drive UI integration .
Use the Google Picker with shared drives
The Google Picker supports selecting items in shared
drives. For details about enabling shared drive support and adding shared drives
views in the picker, see the Google Picker API .
