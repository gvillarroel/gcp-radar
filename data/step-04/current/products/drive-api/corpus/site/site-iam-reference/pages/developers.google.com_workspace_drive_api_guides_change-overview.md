Changes and revisions overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Drive maintains an automatic history of modifications, which can help
users track file changes and content revisions. In the revision history, users
can see what edits have been made and can revert to a specific version of a file
with specific edits.
The following terms are relevant to the changes and revisions resources of the
Google Drive API:
Access Control List (ACL)
The list of all permission resources associated with a file, folder, or shared
drive.
Change
An alteration made to a file's content or metadata of a file or shared drive.
User change log
A record of all changes that a user made to every editable file in their My
Drive, such as a Google Docs, Sheets, or a
Slides. For members of a shared drive, the user change log
also includes entries about shared drive membership, user access levels to
items in that shared drive, and shared drive name changes.
Note: Even if several users can access the same file, not all changes to
that file are reflected in every users' change log. For example, when a user
opens the file for the first time, or marks the file as Starred, those
changes only appear in that users' change log. As another example, when a
file's ACL is changed, it's only reflected in the change log of the
following users: The file's owner, any service accounts on the ACL, and any
users directly impacted by the ACL change.
Shared drive change log
A record of all changes to a shared drive, such as additions or removals of
users, and all changes to items on that shared drive. A change to an item
within a shared drive appears in both the user change log and shared drive
change log.
Change log entry
A record of a change made to a file's content or metadata of a file or shared
drive. A change log entry indicates the user who made the change, the
timestamp, and an ID. There can only be one entry per file or shared drive
in the change log at a time. Each time that file or shared drive changes, a
new ID is created for that entry, and it replaces the previous entry.
Revision
A version of the file representing a change to the file's contents (not
metadata). Each revision can be accessed using the revisions resource within the Drive API.
Head revision
The most current version of a file. The headRevisionId can be accessed using
the files resource within the
Drive API. The headRevisionId is only available for blob files
in Drive.
Blob revision
A version of an unmodifiable binary file, such as an image, video, or PDF. If
the blob revision is the only revision of the binary file, it cannot be
deleted. A new blob can be uploaded as a new revision , which becomes the
new head revision of that file.
Any blob file revision, other than the head revision, that's not designated
as "Keep Forever" is purgeable. Purgeable revisions are typically preserved
for 30 days, but can be purged earlier if a file has 100 revisions that
aren't designated as "Keep Forever" and a new revision is uploaded.
For more information on setting blob revisions as "Keep Forever", see
Specify revisions to save from auto
delete .
Revision history
A record of all revisions of a file in chronological order. A change to a
Docs, Sheets, or Slides file
gets a new revision. Each time the content changes, Drive
creates a new revision history entry for that file. However, these editor
file revisions may be merged together, so the API response might not show
all changes to a file.
