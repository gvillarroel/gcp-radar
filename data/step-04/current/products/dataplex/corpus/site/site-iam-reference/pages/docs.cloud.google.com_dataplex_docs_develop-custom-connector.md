Develop a custom connector for metadata import
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides a reference template to build a custom connector for
extracting metadata from third-party sources, such as MySQL, SQL Server, and
Oracle. You can use this connector to import metadata into Knowledge Catalog (formerly Dataplex Universal Catalog)
through a managed connectivity pipeline .
An example Python connector for Oracle Database Express Edition (XE) is included
as a starting point. You can also develop connectors using Java, Scala, or R.
How connectors work
A connector extracts metadata from a third-party data source, transforms the
metadata to Knowledge Catalog ImportItem format, and generates
metadata import files that can be imported by Knowledge Catalog.
The connector is a part of a managed connectivity pipeline. A managed
connectivity pipeline is an orchestrated workflow that you use to import
Knowledge Catalog metadata. The managed connectivity pipeline
runs the connector and performs other tasks in the import workflow, such as
running a metadata import job and capturing logs.
The managed connectivity pipeline runs the connector by using a
Managed Service for Apache Spark
batch job. Managed Service for Apache Spark provides a
serverless Spark execution environment. Although you can build a connector that
doesn't use Spark, we recommend that you use Spark because it can improve the
performance of your connector.
Connector requirements
The connector has the following requirements:
The connector must be an Artifact Registry image that can be run on
Managed Service for Apache Spark.
The connector must generate metadata files in a format that can be imported
by a Knowledge Catalog metadata import job (the metadataJobs.create
API method). For detailed requirements, see
Metadata import file .
The connector must accept the following command-line arguments to receive
information from the pipeline:
Command-line argument
Value that pipeline provides
target_project_id
PROJECT_ID
target_location_id
REGION
target_entry_group_id
ENTRY_GROUP_ID
output_bucket
CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID
output_folder
FOLDER_ID
The connector uses these arguments to generate metadata in a target entry group
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /entryGroups/ ENTRY_GROUP_ID ,
and to write to a Cloud Storage bucket
gs:// CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID / FOLDER_ID .
Each execution of the pipeline creates a new folder
FOLDER_ID in bucket
CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID . The connector should write
metadata import files to this folder.
The pipeline templates support PySpark connectors. The templates assume that the driver
( mainPythonFileUri )
is a local file on the connector image named main.py . You can modify the
pipeline templates for other scenarios, such as a Spark connector, a different
driver URI, or other options.
Here's how you use PySpark to create an import item in the metadata import
file.
"""PySpark schemas for the data."""
entry_source_schema = StructType ([
StructField ( "display_name" , StringType ()),
StructField ( "source" , StringType ())])
aspect_schema = MapType ( StringType (),
StructType ([
StructField ( "aspect_type" , StringType ()),
StructField ( "data" , StructType ([
]))
])
)
entry_schema = StructType ([
StructField ( "name" , StringType ()),
StructField ( "entry_type" , StringType ()),
StructField ( "fully_qualified_name" , StringType ()),
StructField ( "parent_entry" , StringType ()),
StructField ( "entry_source" , entry_source_schema ),
StructField ( "aspects" , aspect_schema )
])
import_item_schema = StructType ([
StructField ( "entry" , entry_schema ),
StructField ( "aspect_keys" , ArrayType ( StringType ())),
StructField ( "update_mask" , ArrayType ( StringType ()))
])
Before you begin
This guide assumes that you're familiar with Python and PySpark.
Review the following information:
Knowledge Catalog metadata concepts
Documentation about metadata import jobs
Do the following things. Create all resources in the same Google Cloud
location.
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Dataplex, Managed Service for Apache Spark, Workflows, and Artifact Registry APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable dataplex.googleapis.com dataproc.googleapis.com workflows.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator, roles/billing.projectManager, roles/serviceusage.admin, roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator, roles/iam.securityAdmin, roles/storage.admin, roles/artifactregistry.writer, roles/dataplex.entryGroupOwner, roles/dataplex.entryOwner, roles/dataplex.aspectTypeOwner
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Set up authentication:
Ensure that you have the Create Service Accounts IAM role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator ) and the Project IAM Admin role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin ). Learn how to grant roles .
Create the service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with a name for the service account.
Grant the roles/owner IAM
role to the service account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role = roles/owner
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : the name of the service account
PROJECT_ID : the project ID where you created the service account
Note : The --role flag affects which resources the service account can access in your
project. You can revoke these roles or grant additional roles later.
In production environments, do not grant the Owner, Editor, or Viewer roles. Instead, grant a
predefined role or
custom role that meets your needs.
Create a Cloud Storage bucket to
store the metadata import files.
Create the following metadata resources in the same project.
Note: This document assumes all the resources are in the same project
for simplicity. If you want to create resources different projects, you
can adjust the sample code.
For example values, see the
Example metadata resources for an Oracle source
section of this document.
Create an entry group .
Create custom aspect types
for the entries that you want to import. Use the naming convention
SOURCE - ENTITY_TO_IMPORT .
For example, for an Oracle database, create an aspect type named
oracle-database .
Optionally, you can create additional aspect types to store other information.
Create custom entry types
for the resources that you want to import, and assign the relevant
aspect types to them. Use the naming convention
SOURCE - ENTITY_TO_IMPORT .
For example, for an Oracle database, create an entry type named
oracle-database . Link it to the aspect type that is named
oracle-database .
Ensure that your third-party source is accessible from your
Google Cloud project. For more information, see
Managed Service for Apache Spark network configuration .
Create a basic Python connector
The example basic Python connector creates top-level entries for an
Oracle data source by using the Knowledge Catalog client library classes.
Then, you provide the values for the entry fields.
The connector creates a metadata import file with the following entries:
An instance entry, with entry type
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /entryTypes/oracle-instance .
This entry represents an Oracle Database XE system.
A database entry, which represents a database inside the Oracle Database XE
system.
Note: This basic example lets you create the metadata import file without a
connection to Oracle Database XE. To extract metadata in production, you need to
set up a connection to your data source so that the connector can read data
from it.
To build a basic Python connector, do the following:
Clone the
cloud-dataplex repository .
Set up a local environment. We recommend that you use a virtual environment.
mkdir venv
python -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
Use the
active
or
maintenance
versions of Python. Python versions 3.7 and later are supported.
Create a Python project.
Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
The following requirements are installed:
google-cloud-dataplex==2.2.2
google-cloud-storage
google-cloud-secret-manager
Add a main.py pipeline file on the root of the project.
from src import bootstrap
if __name__ == '__main__' :
bootstrap . run ()
When deploying your code to Managed Service for Apache Spark, the main.py
file serves as the entry point for execution. We recommend that you minimize
the amount of information that is stored in the main.py file; use this
file to call functions and classes that are defined within your connector,
such as the src/bootstap.py class.
Create a src folder to store the majority of the logic for your connector.
Update the src/cmd_reader.py file with a Python class to accept command-line
arguments. You can use the
argeparse
module to do this.
"""Command line reader."""
import argparse
def read_args ():

help = "The Cloud Storage bucket to write the generated metadata import file." )
parser . add_argument ( "--output_folder" , type = str , required = True ,
help = "A folder in the Cloud Storage bucket, to write the generated metadata import files." )
return vars ( parser . parse_known_args ()[ 0 ])
In production environments, we recommend that you store the password in
Secret Manager .
Update the src/constants.py file with code to create constants.
"""Constants that are used in the different files."""
import enum

A metadata import file named output.jsonl is returned. The file has two
lines, each representing an import item. The managed connectivity pipeline
reads this file when running the metadata import job.
Optional: Extend the previous example to use the Knowledge Catalog
client library classes to create import items for tables, schemas, and views.
You can also run the Python example on Managed Service for Apache Spark.
We recommend that you create a connector that uses Spark (and runs
on Managed Service for Apache Spark), because it can improve the
performance of your connector.
Create a PySpark connector
This example is based on the
PySpark DataFrame API . You can install PySpark SQL and run it locally before
running on Managed Service for Apache Spark. If you install and run PySpark
locally, install the PySpark library by using pip, but you don't need to install
a local Spark cluster.
For performance reasons, this example doesn't use predefined classes from the
PySpark library. Instead, the example creates DataFrames, converts the
DataFrames into JSON entries, and then writes the output into a metadata import
file in JSON Lines format that can be imported into Knowledge Catalog.

Add SQL queries to return the metadata that you want to import. The queries
need to return the following information:
Database schemas
Tables that belong to these schemas
Columns that belong to these tables, including the column name, column
data type, and whether the column is nullable or required
All of the columns of all the tables and views are stored in the same
system table. You can select columns with the _get_columns method.
Depending on the parameters that you provide, you can select columns for
the tables or for the views separately.
Note the following:
In Oracle, a database schema is owned by a database user and has the same
name as that user.
Schema objects are logical structures that are created by users. Objects
such as tables or indexes can hold data, and objects such as views or
synonyms consist of only a definition.

Oracle JDBC driver .

Note the following:
The methods build the

creates for your Oracle resources. Use the conventions that are described in the
Example metadata resources for an Oracle source

The convert_to_import_items method applies to schemas, tables, and
views. Ensure that the output of the connector is one or more import items that
can be processed by the
metadataJobs.create method ,
not individual entries.
Even in a view, the column is called TABLE_NAME .
Update the bootstrap.py file with code to
generate the metadata import file and run the connector.

Build the connector image.
If your connector contains multiple files, or if you want to use
libraries that aren't included in the default Docker image, you must use a
custom container .
Managed Service for Apache Spark runs workloads within Docker
containers. Create a custom Docker image of the connector and store the
image in Artifact Registry .
Managed Service for Apache Spark reads the image from Artifact Registry.
Note: If the connector contains only one file, you can send the job to
Managed Service for Apache Spark directly. Skip this step.
Create a Dockerfile:
FROM debian:11-slim
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND = noninteractive

RUN apt install -y wget
ENV SPARK_EXTRA_JARS_DIR = /opt/spark/jars/

Use Conda as your package manager. Managed Service for Apache Spark
mounts pyspark into the container at runtime, so you
don't need to install PySpark dependencies in your custom container image.
Build the custom container image and push it to Artifact Registry.
#!/bin/bash
IMAGE = oracle-pyspark:0.0.1
PROJECT = <PROJECT_ID>
REPO_IMAGE = us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT } /docker-repo/oracle-pyspark
docker build -t " ${ IMAGE } " .
# Tag and push to GCP container registry
gcloud config set project ${ PROJECT }
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
docker tag " ${ IMAGE } " " ${ REPO_IMAGE } "
docker push " ${ REPO_IMAGE } "
Because one image can have multiple names, you can use the Docker tag to
assign an alias to the image.
Run the connector on Managed Service for Apache Spark.
To submit a PySpark batch job using the custom container image, run the
gcloud dataproc batches submit pyspark command .
gcloud dataproc batches submit pyspark main.py --project= PROJECT \
--region= REGION --batch= BATCH_ID \
--container-image= CUSTOM_CONTAINER_IMAGE \
--service-account= SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
--jars= PATH_TO_JAR_FILES \
--properties= PYSPARK_PROPERTIES \
-- PIPELINE_ARGUMENTS
Note the following:
The JAR files are drivers for Spark. To read from Oracle, MySQL, or
Postgres, you must provide Apache Spark a specific package. The package
can be located in Cloud Storage or inside the container. If the
JAR file is inside the container, the path is similar to
file:///path/to/file/driver.jar . In this example, the path to the
JAR file is /opt/spark/jars/ .
PIPELINE_ARGUMENTS are the command-line arguments
for the connector.
The connector extracts metadata from the Oracle database, generates a
metadata import file, and saves the metadata import file to a
Cloud Storage bucket.
To manually import the metadata in the metadata import file into
Knowledge Catalog, run a metadata job. Use the
metadataJobs.create method .
In the command line, add environment variables and create an alias for
the curl command.
PROJECT_ID = PROJECT
LOCATION_ID = LOCATION
DATAPLEX_API = dataplex.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ $PROJECT_ID /locations/ $LOCATION_ID
alias gcurl = 'curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json"'
Call the API method, passing the entry types and aspect types that you
want to import.

The schema aspect type is a global aspect type that is defined by
Knowledge Catalog.
Note that the format that you use for aspect type names when calling the
API method is different from the format that you use in the connector
code.
Optional: Use Cloud Logging to view logs for the metadata job. For
more information, see
Monitor Knowledge Catalog logs .
Set up pipeline orchestration
The previous sections showed how to build an example connector and run the
connector manually.
In a production environment, you run the connector as part of a managed
connectivity pipeline, by using an orchestration platform like
Workflows.
To run a managed connectivity pipeline with the example connector, follow the
steps to import metadata using Workflows .
Do these things:
Create the workflow in the same Google Cloud location as the
connector.
In the workflow definition file, update the submit_pyspark_extract_job
function with the following code to extract data from the Oracle database
using the connector that you created.
- submit_pyspark_extract_job :
call : http . post

result: IMPORT_JOB_RESPONSE
Provide the same entry types and aspect types that you included when you
called the API method manually. Note that there isn't a comma at the end
of each string.
When you execute the workflow, provide the following runtime arguments:
{
"CLOUD_REGION" : "us-central1" ,
"ORACLE_USER" : "system" ,
"ORACLE_HOST_PORT" : "x.x.x.x:1521" ,
"ORACLE_DATABASE" : "xe" ,
"ADDITIONAL_CONNECTOR_ARGS" : [],
}
Optional: Use Cloud Logging to view logs for the managed connectivity
pipeline. The log payload includes a link to the logs for the
Managed Service for Apache Spark batch job and the metadata import job,
as relevant. For more information, see
View workflow logs .
Optional: To improve the security, performance, and functionality of your
managed connectivity pipeline, consider doing the following things:
Use Secret Manager
to store the credentials for your third-party data source.
Use PySpark to write the JSON Lines output into multiple metadata import
files in parallel.
Use a prefix to split big files (more than 100 MB) into smaller
files.
Add more custom aspects that capture additional business and technical
metadata from your source.
Example metadata resources for an Oracle source
The example connector extracts metadata from an Oracle database and maps the
metadata to corresponding Knowledge Catalog metadata resources.
Hierarchy considerations
Every system in Knowledge Catalog has a root entry that is the parent
entry for the system. Usually the root entry has an instance entry type.
The following table shows the example hierarchy of entry types and aspect types
for an Oracle system. For example, the oracle-database entry type is linked to
an aspect type that is also named oracle-database .
Entry type ID
Description
Linked aspect type ID
oracle-instance
The root of the imported system.
oracle-instance
oracle-database
The Oracle database.
oracle-database
oracle-schema
The database schema.
oracle-schema
oracle-table
A table.
oracle-table
schema
oracle-view
A view.
oracle-view
schema
The schema aspect type is a global aspect type that is defined by
Knowledge Catalog. It contains a description of the fields in a table,
view, or other entity that has columns. The oracle-schema custom aspect type
contains the name of the Oracle database schema.
Note:
You can use a different name for the root entry if it's relevant for your
system. For example, you can name the root entry for an Apache Kafka system
as cluster .
Depending on the system, you might have only schemas or databases. For
many relational database management systems, "schema" and "database" are
synonyms. To reduce the number of entry types in the hierarchy, consider
choosing one term to use for all similar resources.
Example import item fields
The connector should use the following conventions for Oracle resources.
Fully qualified names : fully qualified names for Oracle
resources use the following naming template. Forbidden characters are
escaped with backticks.
Resource
Template
Example
Instance
SOURCE : ADDRESS
Use the host and port number or the domain name of the system.
oracle:`localhost:1521` or oracle:`myinstance.com`
Database
SOURCE : ADDRESS . DATABASE
oracle:`localhost:1521`.xe
Schema
SOURCE : ADDRESS . DATABASE . SCHEMA
oracle:`localhost:1521`.xe.sys
Table
SOURCE : ADDRESS . DATABASE . SCHEMA . TABLE_NAME
oracle:`localhost:1521`.xe.sys.orders
View
SOURCE : ADDRESS . DATABASE . SCHEMA . VIEW_NAME
oracle:`localhost:1521`.xe.sys.orders_view
Entry names or entry IDs : entries for Oracle resources
use the following naming template. Forbidden characters are replaced with a
permitted character. Resources use the prefix
projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /entryGroups/ ENTRY_GROUP /entries .
Resource
Template
Example
Instance
PREFIX / HOST_PORT
projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/entryGroups/oracle-prod/entries/10.1.1.1@1521
Database
PREFIX / HOST_PORT /databases/ DATABASE
projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/entryGroups/oracle-prod/entries/10.1.1.1@1521/databases/xe
Schema
PREFIX / HOST_PORT /databases/ DATABASE /database_schemas/ SCHEMA
projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/entryGroups/oracle-prod/entries/10.1.1.1@1521/databases/xe/database_schemas/sys
Table
PREFIX / HOST_PORT /databases/ DATABASE /database_schemas/ SCHEMA /tables/ TABLE
projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/entryGroups/oracle-prod/entries/10.1.1.1@1521/databases/xe/database_schemas/sys/tables/orders
View
PREFIX / HOST_PORT /databases/ DATABASE /database_schemas/ SCHEMA /views/ VIEW
projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/entryGroups/oracle-prod/entries/10.1.1.1@1521/databases/xe/database_schemas/sys/views/orders_view
Parent entries : if an entry isn't a root entry for the system, the
entry can have a parent entry field that describes its position in the
hierarchy. The field should contain the name of the parent entry. We
recommend that you generate this value.
The following table shows the parent entries for Oracle resources.
Entry
Parent entry
Instance
"" (empty string)
Database
Instance name
Schema
Database name
Table
Schema name
View
Schema name
Aspect map : the aspect map must contain at least one aspect
that describes the entity to import. Here's an example aspect map for an
Oracle table.
"example-project.us-central1.oracle-table" : {
"aspect_type" : "example-project.us-central1.oracle-table" ,
"path" : "" ,
"data" : {}
},
You can find predefined aspect types (like schema ) that define
the table or view structure in the dataplex-types
project, in the global location.
Aspect keys : aspect keys use the naming format
PROJECT . LOCATION . ASPECT_TYPE .
The following table shows example aspect keys for Oracle resources.
Entry
Example aspect key
Instance
example-project.us-central1.oracle-instance
Database
example-project.us-central1.oracle-database
Schema
example-project.us-central1.oracle-schema
Table
example-project.us-central1.oracle-table
View
example-project.us-central1.oracle-view
