Export metadata
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document explains how to export metadata from Knowledge Catalog (formerly Dataplex Universal Catalog) using a
metadata export job for use in external systems. You can export metadata to
analyze it with tools such as BigQuery, programmatically process large
volumes, or integrate it with custom applications.
This guide assumes you are familiar with
Knowledge Catalog metadata concepts ,
including entry groups, entry types, and aspect types.
Job scope
The job scope defines the metadata to export. You must provide one of the
following job scopes for each metadata export job:
Organization : exports the metadata that belongs to your organization.
Projects : exports the metadata that belongs to the specified projects.
Entry groups : exports the metadata that belongs to the specified
entry groups.
You can further restrict the scope by specifying the entry types or aspect types
to include in the job. The job exports only the entries and aspects that belong
to these entry types and aspect types.
VPC Service Controls
Knowledge Catalog uses
VPC Service Controls to provide additional security
for metadata export jobs. The project that the job belongs to determines the
VPC Service Controls perimeter, as follows:
If you set the job scope to the organization level, the following things happen:
The export scope is the organization that the job belongs to.
Only the entries that are within the VPC Service Controls perimeter are
exported.
Any projects that are within the job's organization but outside the
VPC Service Controls perimeter are excluded.
If you set the job scope to projects or entry groups, the projects or entry
groups must be in the same VPC Service Controls perimeter as the job.
If any of the projects or entry groups violate VPC Service Controls
rules, the job fails.
Before you begin
Before you export metadata, complete the tasks in this section.
Required roles for end users
To get the permissions that
you need to manage metadata export jobs,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Create metadata export jobs:
Dataplex Entry Group Exporter ( roles/dataplex.entryGroupExporter )
on the organization, the projects, or the entry groups to export
Dataplex Metadata Job Owner ( roles/dataplex.metadataJobOwner )
on the project that you run the metadata job in
Access the exported results:
Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer )
on the project or the bucket
View metadata jobs:
Dataplex Metadata Job Viewer ( roles/dataplex.metadataJobViewer )
on the project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to manage metadata export jobs. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to manage metadata export jobs:
Export metadata:
dataplex.metadataJobs.create
dataplex.entryGroups.export
dataplex.entryGroups.get
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
Access the exported results:
storage.objects.get
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Required roles for the Knowledge Catalog service account
To ensure that the
Knowledge Catalog service account
has the necessary permissions to access the Cloud Storage bucket, ask
your administrator to grant the Knowledge Catalog service account the
following permissions on the bucket: storage.buckets.get ,
storage.objects.get , and storage.objects.create .
Configure Google Cloud resources
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Create a Cloud Storage bucket
to store the exported results.
The bucket must be in the same location and the
same VPC Service Controls perimeter as the metadata job.
Run a metadata export job
The following sections show how to export metadata with different job scopes.
Export metadata from your organization
To export the metadata from your organization, use the
metadataJobs.create method
and set the organizationLevel boolean to true .

The response identifies a long-running operation. The exported metadata is saved to a
Cloud Storage bucket.
Get details about a metadata job
To get information about a metadata job, such as the status of the job and the
number of entries that were exported, use the
metadataJobs.get method .
Metadata export results
The metadata export job exports a snapshot of your
Knowledge Catalog metadata at the time that the metadata job was
created.
Export file contents
The contents of the output file follow the same format as the
metadata import file that is used
for metadata import jobs. You can use the output file directly as the input for
a metadata import job.
Export file location
Knowledge Catalog saves the export result files to a
Cloud Storage bucket as objects.
The object path for each output file is constructed by using the bucket
name and custom prefix that you specified in the export job, followed by a
system-generated path. The system-generated path is designed for integration
with BigQuery. The object path uses the following format:
gs:// BUCKET / PREFIX /year= YYYY /month= MM /day= DD /consumer_project= JOB_PROJECT /job= METADATA_JOB_ID /project= METADATA_SOURCE_PROJECT /entry_group= ENTRY_GROUP / FILE_NUMBER .jsonl
Note the following:
The system-generated path starts with the standard Hive partition format for
the export job's creation date. This format is supported by
BigQuery. For more information, see
Loading externally partitioned data .
The consumer_project parameter is the project where you run the metadata
export job. The project parameter is the project that contains the metadata
that you're exporting.
You can reuse a metadata job ID if the previous job was deleted. However,
when you delete a job, it doesn't delete the files that were exported by that
job. This means that if you reuse a deleted job ID, you might see duplicate
job IDs in the output file paths.
Each output file is named with a file number, which is an integer starting
from 1 .
If a metadata export job contains a large number of entries, then
the job splits the results into multiple files to limit the
size of each output file. The maximum number of entries in each output file
is 1,000,000.
Example output files
Here are example output files for a metadata export job that included multiple
projects:
gs://export-bucket/example-folder/year=2025/month=04/day=13/consumer_project=admin-project/job=example-job/ project=metadata-project-1 /entrygroup=entry-group-1/1.jsonl
gs://export-bucket/example-folder/year=2025/month=04/day=13/consumer_project=admin-project/job=example-job/ project=metadata-project-2 /entrygroup=entry-group-1/1.jsonl
gs://export-bucket/example-folder/year=2025/month=04/day=13/consumer_project=admin-project/job=example-job/ project=metadata-project-3 /entrygroup=entry-group-2/1.jsonl
Here are example output files for a metadata export job that contained a large
entry group. The results for the entry group were split into multiple files.
gs://export-bucket/example-folder/year=2025/month=04/day=13/consumer_project=admin-project/job=another-example-job/project=example-metadata-project/ entrygroup=big-entry-group/1 .jsonl
gs://export-bucket/example-folder/year=2025/month=04/day=13/consumer_project=admin-project/job=another-example-job/project=example-metadata-project/ entrygroup=big-entry-group/2 .jsonl
Analyze the exported metadata in BigQuery
If you want to analyze the exported metadata in BigQuery, you can
create an external table for the exported metadata. Creating an external table
lets you query the exported data without additional data loading or
transformation. For example, you can count the number of entries by entry group,
find entries that have specific aspects, or perform additional
analysis in BigQuery .
Do the following:
Create an external table for Hive partitioned data .
Provide the following information:
Select file from Cloud Storage bucket : provide the path to the
Cloud Storage folder that contains the exported metadata files. To
include all files in the bucket, use the asterisk ( * ) wildcard. For
example, gs://export-bucket/example-folder/* .
File format : select JSONL (Newline delimited JSON) .
Select the Source data partitioning checkbox, and then for
Select Source URI Prefix , provide the Cloud Storage URI prefix
for the BigQuery table to define partitions. For example,
gs://export-bucket/example-folder/ .
Partition inference mode : select the Automatically infer types
option.
Table type : select the External table option.
Schema : click the Edit as text toggle, and then enter the following
schema definition for the export files:
[
{
"name" : "entry" ,
"type" : "RECORD" ,
"mode" : "NULLABLE" ,
"fields" : [
{
"mode" : "NULLABLE" ,

}
]
},
{

"name" : "createTime" ,
"type" : "STRING"
},
{
"mode" : "NULLABLE" ,
"name" : "updateTime" ,
"type" : "STRING"
},
{

"name" : "location" ,
"type" : "STRING"
}
]
}
]
}
]
BigQuery creates an external table that contains the exported
metadata. The table's schema includes an entry schema column, where each row
represents one entry. For more information about the fields for an entry, see
ImportItem .
The table's schema also contains the export file partitions, as described in the
Export file location section of this document.
After you create the external table, you can
query the table using GoogleSQL syntax .
For example, to query which entry types were exported, use the following
statement:
SELECT entry.entryType FROM `example-project.example-dataset.example-table` LIMIT 1000
