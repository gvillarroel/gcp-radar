Import metadata using a custom pipeline
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how to import metadata
from a third-party system into Knowledge Catalog (formerly Dataplex Universal Catalog) by using the metadata import API
methods and your own pipeline. Knowledge Catalog metadata
consists of entries and their aspects.
If you instead want to use a Google Cloud-managed orchestration pipeline
to extract and import metadata, we suggest using a
managed connectivity pipeline .
With a managed connectivity pipeline, you bring your own connector that extracts
metadata and generates output in a format that can be used as input by the
metadata import API methods (the metadata import file). Then, you use
Workflows to orchestrate the pipeline tasks.
You can run the following kinds of metadata import jobs:
Full sync of entries with incremental import of their aspects . Supported for
custom entries.
Incremental import of aspects only . Supported for aspects that belong to
custom entries and system entries. For custom entries, you can modify both
optional aspects and required aspects. For system entries, you can modify
optional aspects.
High-level steps
To import metadata using the metadata import API, follow these high-level steps:
Determine the job scope.
Also, understand how Knowledge Catalog applies the comparison logic and
the sync mode for entries and aspects.
Create one or more metadata import files that define the data to import.
Save the metadata import files in a Cloud Storage bucket.
Run a metadata import job.
The steps on this page assume that you're familiar with
Knowledge Catalog metadata concepts, including entry groups, entry types,
and aspect types. For more information, see
About metadata management in Knowledge Catalog .
Before you begin
Before you import metadata, complete the tasks in this section.
Required roles
To ensure that the
Knowledge Catalog service account
has the necessary permissions to access the Cloud Storage bucket, ask
your administrator to grant the Knowledge Catalog service account the
Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer ) IAM role
and the storage.buckets.get permission on the bucket.
To get the permissions that
you need to manage metadata import jobs,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Modify entries and their aspects in a full entry sync metadata job:
Dataplex Entry Type User ( roles/dataplex.entryTypeUser )
on the entry type or the project where the entry type is defined
Dataplex Aspect Type User ( roles/dataplex.aspectTypeUser )
on the aspect type or the project where the aspect type is defined
Modify required aspects in an aspect-only metadata job:
Dataplex Entry Type User ( roles/dataplex.entryTypeUser )
on the entry type or the project where the entry type is defined
Dataplex Aspect Type User ( roles/dataplex.aspectTypeUser )
on the aspect type or the project where the aspect type is defined
Modify optional aspects in an aspect-only metadata job:
Dataplex Aspect Type User ( roles/dataplex.aspectTypeUser )
on the aspect type or the project where the aspect type is defined. Note that when modifying optional aspects in an aspect-only metadata job, you don't need permissions for the associated entry type.
Create metadata import jobs:
Dataplex Entry Group Importer ( roles/dataplex.entryGroupImporter )
on the project or the resource
Dataplex Entry and EntryLink Owner ( roles/dataplex.entryOwner )
on the project or the resource
View metadata jobs:
Dataplex Metadata Job Viewer ( roles/dataplex.metadataJobViewer )
on the project
Create, view, and cancel metadata jobs:
Dataplex Metadata Job Owner ( roles/dataplex.metadataJobOwner )
on the project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create Google Cloud resources
Prepare the following Google Cloud resources:
Create entry groups
for the entries that you want to import.
Create aspect types
for the aspects that you want to import.
Create entry types
for the entries that you want to import.
If you're running an aspect-only metadata job,
create entries
for the aspects that you want to import.
Create a Cloud Storage bucket
to store your metadata import files.
Components of a metadata import job
When you import metadata, consider the following components of a metadata job:
Job scope : the entry groups, entry types, and aspect types to include in
the job.
Sync mode : how the entries and aspects in the job are updated.
Metadata import file : a file that defines the values to set for the entries
and aspects in the job. You can provide multiple metadata import files in the
same metadata job. You save the files in Cloud Storage.
Comparison logic : how Knowledge Catalog determines which entries and
aspects to modify.
Job scope
The job scope defines the entry groups, the entry types, and the
aspect types that you want to include in a metadata import job. When you import
metadata, you modify the entries and aspects that belong to resources within the
job's scope.
To define the job scope, follow these guidelines:
Entry groups : specify one or more entry groups to include in the job.
The job modifies only the entries and aspects that belong to these entry groups.
The entry groups and the job must be in the same region.
Entry types : specify one or more entry types to include in the job. The job
modifies only the entries and aspects that belong to these entry types.
The location of an entry type must either match the location of the job, or
the entry type must be global.
Aspect types : specify one or more aspect types to include
in the job. The job modifies only the aspects that belong to these aspect types.
The location of an aspect type must either match the location of the job, or
the aspect type must be global.
The job scope must include all of the entry types and aspect types that you
specify in the metadata import file.
You specify the job scope when you create a metadata job.
Sync mode
The sync mode specifies how the entries and aspects in a metadata import job are
updated. You provide a sync mode for both entries and aspects. Depending on what
resources you want to import, the following combinations of sync modes are
supported.
Goal
Entry sync mode
Aspect sync mode
Results
Import entries and their aspects
FULL
INCREMENTAL
All entries in the job's scope are modified.
If an entry exists in Knowledge Catalog but isn't included in
the metadata import file, the entry is deleted when you run the
metadata job.
An aspect is modified only if the metadata import file includes a
reference to the aspect in the updateMask field and the
aspectKeys field. See
Structure of an import item .
Import aspects only
NONE
INCREMENTAL
Aspects are modified if they are part of the job's scope, and if the
metadata import file includes a reference to the aspects in the
aspectKeys field. See
Structure of an import item .
Other metadata that belongs to entries in the job's scope isn't
modified.
You specify the sync mode when you create a metadata job.
Metadata import file
The metadata import file is a collection of the entries and aspects that you
want to modify. It defines the values to set for all of the fields that belong
to these entries and aspects. You prepare the file before you run a metadata
import job.
These general guidelines apply:
You can provide multiple metadata import files in the same metadata job.
When you run a full entry sync metadata job, the entries that you provide in
the file completely replace all of the existing
entries for any resources that are within the job's scope. This means that you
must include values for all of the entries in a job, not just the values that
you want to add or update. To get a list of the current entries in your project
to use as a starting point, use the
entries.list API method .
Caution: If an entry exists in Knowledge Catalog but isn't included in the
metadata import file, the entry is deleted when you run the metadata job. If the
metadata import file contains no data, all entries and aspects that belong to
the job's scope are deleted.
You must provide a metadata import file as part of a metadata job. If you want
to delete all existing data for the entries that are within the job's scope,
provide an empty metadata import file.
All of the entries and aspects that you include in the file must belong to the
entry groups, entry types, and aspect types that you define in the job's scope.
Use the detailed guidelines in the following sections to create a metadata
import file.
Structure of the file
Each line in the metadata import file contains a JSON object that corresponds
to one import item. An import item is an object that describes the values to
modify for an entry and its attached aspects.
You can provide multiple import items in a single metadata import file. However,
don't provide the same import item more than once in a metadata job. Use a
newline character ( 0x0a ) to separate each import item.
A metadata import file with a newline character between each import item looks
like the following example:
{ "entry": { "name": "entry 1", #Information about entry 1 }
{ "entry": { "name": "entry 2", #Information about entry 2 }
Structure of an import item
Each import item in the metadata import file can include the following fields
(see ImportItem ).
The following example is formatted with line breaks for readability, but when
you save the file, include a newline character only after each import
item. Don't include line breaks between the fields of a single import item.
{
"entry": {
"name": " ENTRY_NAME ",
"entryType": " ENTRY_TYPE ",
"entrySource": {
"resource": " RESOURCE ",
"system": " SYSTEM ",
"platform": " PLATFORM ",
"displayName": " DISPLAY_NAME ",
"description": " DESCRIPTION ",
"createTime": " ENTRY_CREATE_TIMESTAMP ",
"updateTime": " ENTRY_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP "
},
"aspects": {
" ASPECT ": {
"data": {
" KEY ": " VALUE "
},
"aspectSource": {
"createTime": " ASPECT_CREATE_TIMESTAMP ",
"updateTime": " ASPECT_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP "
}
},
# Additional aspect maps
},
"parentEntry": " PARENT_ENTRY ",
"fullyQualifiedName": " FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAME "
},
"updateMask": " UPDATE_MASK_FIELDS ",
"aspectKeys": [
" ASPECT_KEY ",
# Additional aspect keys
],
}
Replace the following:
entry : information about an entry and its attached aspects.
In an aspect-only metadata import job, Knowledge Catalog ignores
all optional fields for an entry except for the aspect maps.
ENTRY_NAME : the relative resource name of the entry,
in the format
projects/ PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION_ID /entryGroups/ ENTRY_GROUP_ID /entries/ ENTRY_ID .
ENTRY_TYPE : the relative resource name of the
entry type that was used to create this entry, in the format
projects/ PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION_ID /entryTypes/ ENTRY_TYPE_ID .
entrySource : information from the source system about the data resource that
is represented by the entry:
RESOURCE : the name of the resource in the source
system.
SYSTEM : the name of the source system.
PLATFORM : the platform containing the source system.
DISPLAY_NAME : a user-friendly display name.
DESCRIPTION : a description of the entry.
ENTRY_CREATE_TIMESTAMP : the time the entry was
created in the source system.
ENTRY_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP : the time the entry was
updated in the source system.
aspects : the aspects that are attached to the entry. The aspect object and
its data are called an aspect map.
ASPECT : an aspect that is attached to the entry.
Depending on how the aspect is attached to the entry, use one of the following
formats:
If the aspect is attached directly to the entry, provide the relative resource
name of its aspect type, in the format
PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER . LOCATION_ID . ASPECT_TYPE_ID .
If the aspect is attached to the entry's path, provide the aspect type's
path, in the format
PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER . LOCATION_ID . ASPECT_TYPE_ID @ PATH .
KEY and VALUE : the content of the
aspect, according to its aspect type metadata template. The content must be
encoded as UTF-8. The maximum size of the field is 120 KB. The data
dictionary is required, even if it is empty.
ASPECT_CREATE_TIMESTAMP : the time the aspect was created in
the source system.
ASPECT_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP : the time the aspect was updated in
the source system.
PARENT_ENTRY : the resource name of the parent entry.
FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAME : a name for the entry that can be
referenced by an external system. See
Fully qualified names .
UPDATE_MASK_FIELDS : the fields to update, in paths that are
relative to the Entry resource. Separate each field with a comma.
In a full entry sync job, Knowledge Catalog includes the paths of all
of the fields for an entry that can be modified, including aspects.
The updateMask field is ignored when an entry is created or re-created.
In an aspect-only metadata job, set this value to aspects .
ASPECT_KEY : the aspects to modify. Supports the
following syntaxes:
ASPECT_TYPE_REFERENCE : matches the aspect type for
aspects that are attached directly to the entry.
ASPECT_TYPE_REFERENCE @ PATH :
matches the aspect type and the specified path.
ASPECT_TYPE_REFERENCE @* : matches the aspect type
for all paths.
*@ PATH : matches all aspects types on the specified
path.
Replace ASPECT_TYPE_REFERENCE with a reference to the
aspect type, in the format
PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER . LOCATION_ID . ASPECT_TYPE_ID .
In a full entry sync job, if you leave this field empty, it is treated as
specifying exactly those aspects that are present within the specified entry.
Knowledge Catalog implicitly adds the keys for
all of the required aspects of an entry.
File requirements
The metadata import file has the following requirements:
The file must be formatted as a JSON Lines
file, which is a newline-delimited JSON file. Use a newline character ( 0x0a )
to separate each import item.
The file must use UTF-8 character encoding.
Supported file extensions are .jsonl and .json .
The file size of each metadata import file must be less than 1 GiB. The
maximum total size for all data in the metadata job is 3 GB. This
includes all files and metadata associated with the job.
The entry types and aspect types that you specify in the file must be part of
the metadata job's scope.
The file must be uploaded to a Cloud Storage bucket. Don't save the
file in a folder named CLOUD_STORAGE_URI /deletions/ .
Comparison logic
Knowledge Catalog determines which entries and aspects to modify by comparing the
values and timestamps that you provide in the metadata import file with the values
and timestamps that exist in your project.
At a high level, Knowledge Catalog updates the values in your project
when at least one proposed change in the metadata import file will change
the state of your project when the job runs, without introducing out-of-date
data. The proposed change must be referenced in the update mask field or the aspect
keys field in the metadata import file.
The comparison logic varies depending on what kind of metadata import job you run.
Full entry sync job
In a full entry sync metadata job,
for each entry that is part of the job's scope, Knowledge Catalog does one
of the following things:
Creates an entry and attached aspects . If the metadata import file includes
an entry that doesn't exist in your project, Knowledge Catalog
creates the entry and attached aspects.
Deletes an entry and attached aspects . If an entry exists in your
project, but the metadata import file doesn't include the entry,
Knowledge Catalog deletes the entry and its attached aspects from your
project.
Updates an entry and attached aspects . If an entry exists in both
the metadata import file and in your project, Knowledge Catalog
evaluates the entry source timestamps and the aspect source timestamps that
are associated with the entry to determine which values to modify. Then,
Knowledge Catalog does one or more of the following things:
Re-creates the entry . If the entry source create timestamp in the
metadata import file is more recent than the corresponding timestamp in your
project, Knowledge Catalog re-creates the entry in your project.
Updates the entry . If the entry source update timestamp in the metadata
import file is more recent than the corresponding timestamp in your project,
Knowledge Catalog updates the entry in your project.
Creates an aspect . If an aspect doesn't exist in your project, and is
included in an aspect map, the update mask field, and the aspect keys
field in the metadata import file, Knowledge Catalog creates the aspect.
Deletes an aspect . If an aspect exists in your project, and is included
in the update mask field and the aspect keys field in the metadata import
file, but isn't included in an aspect map, Knowledge Catalog
deletes the aspect.
Updates an aspect . If an aspect exists in your project and is included
in an aspect map, the update mask field, and the aspect keys field in
the metadata import file, and the aspect source update timestamp in the
metadata import file is more recent than the corresponding timestamp in
your project, Knowledge Catalog updates the aspect.
If an aspect source update timestamp isn't provided in the metadata import
file, but the corresponding entry is marked for an update,
Knowledge Catalog also updates the aspect.
However, if at least one aspect in the metadata import file has an older
timestamp than the corresponding timestamp in your project, then
Knowledge Catalog doesn't make any updates for the attached entry.
Aspect-only job
In an aspect-only metadata job,
for each aspect that is part of the job's scope, Knowledge Catalog does one
of the following things:
Creates an aspect . If an aspect doesn't exist in your project, and is
included in an aspect map, the update mask field, and the aspect keys
field in the metadata import file, Knowledge Catalog creates the aspect.
Deletes an aspect . For optional aspects, if the aspect exists in your
project, and is included in the update mask field and the aspect keys field
in the metadata import file, but isn't included in an aspect map,
Knowledge Catalog deletes the aspect.
Required aspects can't be deleted.
Updates an aspect . If an aspect exists in your project and is included
in an aspect map, the update mask field, and the aspect keys field in
the metadata import file, and the aspect source update timestamp in the
metadata import file is more recent than the corresponding timestamp in
your project, Knowledge Catalog updates the aspect.
If an aspect source update timestamp isn't provided in the metadata import
file, Knowledge Catalog also updates the aspect.
Knowledge Catalog updates aspects based on the aspect source update
timestamp, regardless of the corresponding entry's entry source update
timestamp.
Create a metadata import file
Before you import metadata, create a metadata import file for your job. Follow
these steps:
Prepare a metadata import file by following
the guidelines that are described previously in this document.
Upload the file to a Cloud Storage bucket .
You can provide multiple metadata import files in the same metadata job. To
provide multiple files, save the files in the same Cloud Storage
bucket. When run the job, you specify a bucket, not a specific file.
Knowledge Catalog imports metadata from all of the files that are saved in
the bucket, including files that are in subfolders.
Run a metadata import job
After you create a metadata import file, run the metadata import job.

To cancel a metadata job, use the

View job logs and troubleshoot
Use Cloud Logging to view logs for a metadata job. For more information, see
Monitor Knowledge Catalog logs .
You configure the log level when you create a metadata job. The following log
levels are available:
INFO : provides logs at the overall job level. Includes aggregate logs about
import items, but doesn't specify which import item has an error.
DEBUG : provides detailed logs for each import item. Use debug-level logging
to troubleshoot issues with specific import items. For example, use
debug-level logging to identify resources that are missing from the job
scope, entries or aspects that don't conform to the associated entry type or
aspect type, or other misconfigurations with the metadata import file.
Note: Depending on the size of your metadata job and the number of logs that
are generated, debug-level logging might incur additional costs. For more
information, see Google Cloud Observability Pricing .
Validation errors
Knowledge Catalog validates the metadata import files against the current
metadata in your project. If there is a validation issue, the job status might
return one of the following states:
FAILED : happens when the metadata import file has an error.
Knowledge Catalog doesn't import any metadata and the job fails. Examples
of errors in the metadata import file include the following:
An item in the file can't be parsed into a valid import item
An entry or aspect in the file belongs to an entry group, entry type, or
aspect type that isn't part of the job's scope
The same entry name is specified more than once in the job
An aspect type that is specified in an aspect map or the aspect keys
doesn't use the format
PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER . LOCATION_ID . ASPECT_TYPE_ID @ OPTIONAL_PATH
A required aspect is marked for deletion
SUCCEEDED_WITH_ERRORS : happens when the metadata import file can be
successfully parsed, but importing an item in the file would cause an entry in
your project to be in an inconsistent state. Knowledge Catalog ignores
such entries, but imports the rest of the metadata from the file.
Use job logs to troubleshoot the error.
