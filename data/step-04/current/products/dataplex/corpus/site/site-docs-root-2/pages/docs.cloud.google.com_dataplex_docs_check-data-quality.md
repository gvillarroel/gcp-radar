Use data quality tasks
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Caution: Knowledge Catalog (formerly Dataplex Universal Catalog) data quality tasks is a legacy offering based
on open source software. We recommend that you start using the latest
built-in Automatic data quality
offering.
This document shows you how to create Knowledge Catalog data quality tasks
that let you schedule and run data quality checks for your built-in and
external BigQuery tables.
For more information, see
Data quality tasks overview .
Before you begin
This document assumes that you have an existing Knowledge Catalog lake to
create the data quality task in.
Enable Google APIs and services
Enable the Dataproc API.
Enable the API
Enable Private Google Access
for your network and subnetwork. Enable Private Google Access on
the network that you plan to use with Knowledge Catalog data quality
tasks. If you don't specify a network or subnetwork when you create the
Knowledge Catalog data quality task, Knowledge Catalog uses the
default subnet. In that case, you need to enable
Private Google Access on the default subnet.
Create a specification file
Knowledge Catalog uses open source CloudDQ
as the driver program. Knowledge Catalog data quality check requirements
are defined within CloudDQ YAML specification files.
As input to the data quality task, you can have a single YAML file or a single zip archive
containing one or more YAML files. It's
recommended that you capture the data quality check requirements in separate YAML specification
files, with one file for each section.
To prepare a specification file, do the following:
Create one or more CloudDQ YAML specification files that define your data quality check
requirements. For more information about the required syntax, see the
About the specification file section of this
document.
Save the YAML specification file in .yml or .yaml format. If you
create multiple YAML specification files, save all of the files in a single zip archive.
Create a Cloud Storage bucket .
Upload the specification file to the
Cloud Storage bucket.
About the specification file
Your CloudDQ YAML specification file needs to have the following sections:
Rules (defined in the top-level rules YAML node): A list of rules to
run. You can create these rules from predefined rule types, such as NOT_NULL
and REGEX , or you can extend them with custom SQL statements such as
CUSTOM_SQL_EXPR and CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT . The CUSTOM_SQL_EXPR statement
flags any row that custom_sql_expr evaluated to False as a failure. The
CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT statement flags any value returned by the whole
statement as a failure.
Row filters (defined in the top-level row_filters YAML node): SQL
expressions returning a boolean value that define filters to fetch a subset of
data from the underlying entity subject for validation.
Rule bindings (defined in the top-level rule_bindings YAML node):
Defines rules and rule filters to apply to the tables.
Rule dimensions (defined in the rule_dimensions YAML node): Defines the allowed
list of data quality rule dimensions that a rule can define in the corresponding
dimension field.
For example:
rule_dimensions:
- consistency
- correctness
- duplication
- completeness
- conformance
The dimension field is optional for a rule. The rule dimensions section
is mandatory if dimension is listed on any rule.
For more information, see the
CloudDQ reference guide
and the sample specification files .
Note: Due to a CloudDQ limitation, you cannot have more than one top
node for each section (such as rules or rule_bindings )
in a single YAML file, as CloudDQ only parses the last node of each type within a file.
Create a dataset to store the results
To store the results, create a BigQuery dataset .
The dataset must be in the same region as the tables that you run the data quality task on.
Knowledge Catalog uses this dataset, and it creates or reuses a table of your choice to
store the results.
Create a service account
Create a service account that has the following
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions:
Read access to the Cloud Storage path containing the YAML
specifications. You can use the Storage Object Viewer role
( roles/storage.objectViewer ) on the Cloud Storage bucket.
Read access to BigQuery datasets with data to be validated.
You can use the BigQuery Data Viewer role
( roles/bigquery.dataViewer ).
Write access to the BigQuery dataset to create a table
(if necessary) and write the results to that table. You can
use the BigQuery Data Editor role
( roles/bigquery.dataEditor ) at the dataset level.
BigQuery Job User role ( roles/bigquery.jobUser ) at the project level
in order to create BigQuery jobs in a project.
The Dataplex Metadata Reader role ( roles/dataplex.metadataReader )
at the project or lake level.
The Service Usage Consumer role
( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer ) at the project level.
The Dataproc Worker role
( roles/dataproc.worker ).
The iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission
given to the user submitting the job.
The Service account user role granted
to the Knowledge Catalog lake service account. You can
view the Knowledge Catalog lake service account in the Google Cloud console .
Use advanced settings
These steps are optional:
BigQuery runs data quality checks in the current project by default. You can
choose a different project to run the BigQuery jobs. Use the
--gcp_project_id TASK_ARGS
argument for the --execution-args property of the task.
If the project ID specified to run BigQuery queries is different from the
project in which the service account (specified by
--execution-service-account ) is created, ensure that the organization policy that
disables cross-project service account usage
( iam.disableServiceAccountCreation ) is turned off. Also, ensure that the
service account can access the BigQuery job schedule in the project where
BigQuery queries are being run.
Limitations
All the tables specified for a given data quality task must belong to the same Google Cloud
region.
Schedule a data quality task
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Knowledge Catalog Process page.
Go to Process
Click add_box Create task .
On the Check Data Quality card, click Create task .
For Dataplex lake , choose your lake.
For ID , enter an ID.
In the Data quality specification section, do the following:
In the Select GCS file field, click Browse .
Select your Cloud Storage bucket.
Click Select .
In the Results table section, do the following:
In the Select BigQuery dataset field, click Browse .
Select the BigQuery dataset to store validation outcomes.
Click Select .
In the BigQuery table field, enter the name of the table to store the results.
If the table doesn't exist, Knowledge Catalog creates it for you. Don't use the name
dq_summary because it is reserved for internal processing tasks.
In the Service account section, select a service account from the
User service account menu.
Click Continue .
In the Set schedule section, configure the schedule for running the data
quality task.
Click Create .
gcloud CLI

View the results
The results of the data quality validations are stored in the BigQuery dataset
and summary table that you specified, as described in
Create a dataset to store the results .
The summary table contains the
output summary for each combination of rule binding and rule for each validation
run. The output in the summary table includes the following information:
Column name
Description
dataplex_lake
(string) ID of the Knowledge Catalog lake containing the table
being validated.
dataplex_zone
(string) ID of the Knowledge Catalog zone containing the table
being validated.
dataplex_asset_id
(string) ID of the Knowledge Catalog asset containing the table
being validated.
execution_ts
(timestamp) Timestamp of when the validation query was run.
rule_binding_id
(string) ID of the rule binding for which validation results are
reported.
rule_id
(string) ID of the rule under the rule binding for which validation
results are reported.
dimension
(string) Data quality dimension of the rule_id . This value can only be
one of the values specified in the rule_dimensions YAML node.
table_id
(string) ID of the entity for which validation results are reported.
This ID is specified under the entity parameter of the
respective rule binding.
column_id
(string) ID of the column for which validation results are reported.
This ID is specified under the column parameter of the
respective rule binding.
last_modified
(timestamp) The last modified timestamp of the table_id
being validated.
metadata_json_string
(string) Key-value pairs of the metadata parameter content specified
under the rule binding or during the data quality run.
configs_hashsum
(string) The hash sum of the JSON document containing the rule binding
and all its associated rules, rule bindings, row filters, and entity configurations.
configs_hashsum allows tracking when the content of a
rule_binding ID or one of its referenced configurations has changed.
dq_run_id
(string) Unique ID of the record.
invocation_id
(string) ID of the data quality run. All data quality summary records
generated within the same data quality execution instance share the same
invocation_id .
progress_watermark
(boolean) Determines whether this particular record is considered
by the data quality check to determine the high watermark for
incremental validation. If FALSE , the respective record is
ignored when establishing the high-watermark value. This information is useful when
executing test data quality validations that should not advance the
high watermark. Knowledge Catalog populates this field with
TRUE by default, but the value can be overridden if the
--progress_watermark argument has a value of FALSE .
rows_validated
(integer) Total number of records validated after applying
row_filters and any high-watermark filters on the
incremental_time_filter_column_id column, if specified.
complex_rule_validation_errors_count
(float) Number of rows returned by a CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT
rule.
complex_rule_validation_success_flag
(boolean) Success status of CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules.
success_count
(integer) Total number of records that passed validation. This field
is set to NULL for CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules.
success_percentage
(float) Percentage of the number of records that passed validation
within the total number of records validated. This field is set to
NULL for CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules.
failed_count
(integer) Total number of records that failed validation. This field
is set to NULL for CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules.
failed_percentage
(float) Percentage of the number of records that failed validation
within the total number of records validated. This field is set to
NULL for CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules.
null_count
(integer) Total number of records that returned null during validation.
This field is set to NULL for NOT_NULL and
CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules.
null_percentage
(float) Percentage of the number of records that returned null during
validation within the total number of records validated. This field is
set to NULL for NOT_NULL and
CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules.
failed_records_query
For every rule that fails, this column stores a query that
you can use to get failed records. In this document, see
Troubleshoot failed rules with
failed_records_query .
For BigQuery entities, a view is created for every
rule_binding containing the SQL validation logic of
the latest execution. You can find these views in the BigQuery
dataset specified in the argument --gcp-bq-dataset-id .
Cost optimizations
Data quality tasks are executed as BigQuery jobs in
your project. To control the cost for running data quality jobs, use
BigQuery pricing on the project where your BigQuery
jobs run. For more information, see
BigQuery workload management .
Incremental validations
Often, you have tables that are updated routinely with new
partitions (new rows). If you don't want to revalidate old partitions in every
run, you can use incremental validations.
For incremental validations, you must have a TIMESTAMP or DATETIME type column
in your table where the column value monotonically increases. You can use the
columns that your BigQuery table is partitioned on.
To specify incremental validation, specify a value for
incremental_time_filter_column_id= TIMESTAMP/DATETIME type column
as part of a rule binding.
When you specify a column, the data quality task considers only rows with a
TIMESTAMP value greater than the timestamp of the last data quality task that
ran.
Example specification files
To use these samples, create a BigQuery dataset
named sales . Then, create a fact table named sales_orders and add
sample data by
running a query
with the following GoogleSQL statements:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sales.sales_orders
(
id STRING NOT NULL ,
last_modified_timestamp TIMESTAMP ,
customer_id STRING ,
item_id STRING ,
amount NUMERIC ,
transaction_currency STRING
);
INSERT INTO sales.sales_orders
( id , last_modified_timestamp, customer_id, item_id, amount, transaction_currency)
VALUES
( "order1" , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (), "customer1" , "ASDWQ123456789012345" , 100 , "USD" ),
( "order1" , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (), "customer2" , "bad_item_id" , -10 , "XXX" ),
( "order2" , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (), "customer3" , "INTNL987654321098765" , 50 , "GBP" ),
( "order3" , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (), "customer4" , "INTNL932716428593847" , 50 , "GBP" )
Sample 1
The following code sample creates data quality checks for validating these
values:
amount : values are zero or positive numbers.
item_id : an alphanumeric string of 5 alphabetical characters, followed
by 15 digits.
transaction_currency : an allowed currency type, as defined by a static
list. The static list of this sample allows GBP and JPY as currency types. This
validation only applies to rows marked as international.

Sample 2
If the table to be checked is part of a Knowledge Catalog lake, you can
specify the tables using lake or zone notation. This lets you aggregate
your results by lake or zone. For example, you can generate a zone level score.
To use this sample, create a Knowledge Catalog lake with the lake ID
operations and the zone ID procurement . Then, add the table sales_orders
as an asset to the zone.

Troubleshoot failed rules with failed_records_query
For every rule that fails, the summary table
stores a query in the failed_records_query column
that you can use to get failed records.
To debug, you can also use reference columns in your YAML file,
which lets you join the output of failed_records_query with
the original data to get the entire record. For example, you can specify
a primary_key column or a compound primary_key column as
a reference column.
Note: Failed record queries do not use reference_columns for
CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules. The output of the failed records query depends on the
query in CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT itself. For example, if you need a reference column in
the failed records query for a CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rule, you need to include the
column in the SQL statement as well. See Use failed records
queries for CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules for more information.
Specify reference columns
To generate reference columns, you can add the following to your YAML specification:
The reference_columns section. In this section, you can create one or more
reference column sets, with each set specifying one or more columns.
The rule_bindings section. In this section, you can add a line to a rule
binding that specifies a reference column ID ( reference_columns_id ) to use for the
rules in that rule binding. It should be one of the reference column sets specified in the
reference_columns section.
For example, the following YAML file specifies a reference_columns section and
defines three columns: id , last_modified_timestamp , and
item_id as part of the ORDER_DETAILS_REFERENCE_COLUMNS set. The
following example uses the sample table sales_orders .

Using the failed records query
The failed records query generates a row for every record that has a rule that
failed. It includes the column name that triggered the failure, the value that
triggered the failure, and the values for the reference columns. It also
includes metadata that you can use to relate to the execution of
the data quality task.
The following is an example of the output from a failed records query for the YAML file
described in Specify reference columns . It shows a
failure for column amount and a failed value of -10 . It also records
the corresponding value for the reference column.

Use failed records queries for CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules
For CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules, failed record queries include the
custom_sql_statement_validation_errors column. The
custom_sql_statement_validation_errors column is a nested column with fields that
match the output of your SQL statement. Reference columns are not included in failed records
queries for CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rules.
For example, your CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT rule might look like this:
rules :
TEST_RULE :
rule_type : CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT
custom_sql_arguments :
- existing_id
- replacement_id
params :
CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENT : |-
( SELECT product_name , product_key FROM data
where $ existing_id != $ replacement_id )
The results for this example will contain one or more rows for the custom_sql_statement_validation_errors
column, with a row for every occurrence where existing_id!=replacement_id .
When rendered in JSON, the contents of a cell in this column might look like this:
{
"custom_sql_statement_valdation_errors" :{
"product_name"="abc"
"product_key"="12345678"
"_rule_binding_id"="your_rule_binding"
}
}
You can join these results to the original table with a nested reference like join on custom_sql_statement_valdation_errors.product_key .
