Auto data quality overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Dataplex Universal Catalog lets you define and measure the quality of the data in your
BigQuery tables. You can automate the data scanning, validate data
against defined rules, and log alerts if your data doesn't meet quality
requirements. Auto data quality lets you manage data quality rules and
deployments as code, improving the integrity of data production pipelines.
To scan data for anomalies, see Dataplex Universal Catalog data profile scan .
The scan can generate data quality rules. You can also use predefined quality
rules or build custom rules.
Dataplex Universal Catalog provides monitoring, troubleshooting, and
Cloud Logging alerting that's integrated with auto data quality.
Conceptual model
A data quality scan is a type of Dataplex Universal Catalog data
scan that
validates your data against a set of predefined rules. A data scan is a
Dataplex Universal Catalog job that samples data from BigQuery and
Cloud Storage (through BigQuery external tables) and infers
various types of metadata. To measure the
quality of a table using auto data quality, you create a DataScan object of
type data quality . The scan runs on only one BigQuery table.
The scan uses resources in a Google tenant
project , so you don't need to set
up your own infrastructure.
Creating and using a data quality scan consists of the following steps:
Define data quality rules
Configure rule execution
Analyze data quality scan results
Set up monitoring and alerting
Troubleshoot data quality failures
Rule definition
Data quality rules associated with a data quality scan define data
expectations. You can create data quality rules in the following ways:
Use recommendations from Dataplex Universal Catalog data profiling
Use the predefined rules
Create custom SQL rules
Predefined rules
Dataplex Universal Catalog supports the following categories of predefined rules:
Row-level
For row-level category rules, the expectation is applied
against each data row. Each row independently passes or
fails the condition. For example, column_A_value < 1 .
Row-level checks require you to specify a passing threshold. When the
percentage of rows passing the rule falls below the threshold value, the rule
fails.
Aggregate
For aggregate rules, the expectation is
applied against a single value aggregated across the entire data. For
example, Avg(someCol) >= 10 . To pass, the check must evaluate to the
boolean true . Aggregate rules don't provide an independent pass or fail
count for each row.
For both of the rule categories, you can set the following parameters:
The column to which the rule applies
A dimension
The following table lists the supported row-level and aggregate rule types:

Supported custom SQL rule types
SQL rules provide flexibility to expand the validation with custom logic. These
rules come in the following types.
Rule type
Row-level or aggregate rule
Description
Supported column types
Rule-specific parameters
Example
Row condition
Row-level
Specify an expectation for every row by defining a SQL
expression in a WHERE clause. The SQL expression should
evaluate to true (pass) or false (fail)
per row.
Dataplex Universal Catalog computes the percentage of rows that pass
this expectation and compares this value against the passing threshold percentage
to determine the success or failure of the rule.
The expression can include a reference to another table, for example, to create
referential integrity checks.
All columns
Required:
SQL condition to use
Passing threshold percentage
Dimension
Optional:
Column to associate this rule with.
grossWeight <= netWeight
Table condition (aggregate SQL expression)
Aggregate
These rules are executed once per table. Provide a SQL expression that
evaluates to boolean true (pass) or false (fail).
The SQL expression can
include a reference to another table using expression subqueries .
All columns
Required:
SQL condition to use
Dimension
Optional:
Column to associate this rule with
Simple aggregate example: avg(price) > 100
Using an expression subquery to compare values across a different table:
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `example_project.example_dataset.different-table`) < COUNT(*)
SQL assertion
Aggregate
An assertion rule uses a data quality query to find rows that fail
one or more conditions specified in the query. Provide a SQL statement
that is evaluated to return rows that match the invalid state. If the
query returns any rows, the rule fails.
Omit the trailing semicolon from the SQL statement.
The SQL statement can include a reference to another table using
expression subqueries .
All columns
Required:
SQL statement to check invalid state
Dimension
Optional:
Column to associate this rule with.
Simple aggregate example to make sure that discount_pct
is not greater than 100:
SELECT * FROM example_project.example_dataset.table WHERE discount_pct > 100
Using an expression subquery to compare values across a different table:
SELECT * FROM `example_project.example_dataset.different-table` WHERE gross_weight > (SELECT avg(gross_weight) FROM `example_project.example_dataset.different-table`)
For example rules, see auto data quality sample rules .
For SQL functions supported, see GoogleSQL reference .
Dimensions
Dimensions let you aggregate the results of multiple data quality rules for
monitoring and alerting. You must associate every data quality rule with a
dimension. Dataplex Universal Catalog provides the following dimensions:
Freshness
Freshness measures when the data was last updated. Having this information
can help you determine whether the data is recent enough to be useful.
Volume
Volume measures whether all of the expected data is present.
Completeness
Completeness assesses whether the data contains all of the information that's
required for its intended purpose.
Validity
Validity evaluates whether the data conforms to predefined standards for
format, acceptable ranges, or other criteria. For example, if a valid date needs
to have the format YYYY/mm/dd , then 08-12-2019 is invalid data. As another
example, if a valid sales price for an item is between $10 and $20, then a sales
price of $100 is invalid data.
Consistency
Consistency refers to having the same values for data across multiple
instances, such as tables and columns. Inconsistency in data arises when, for
example, the revenue of a product differs when it is read from a sales database
or a usage database.
Accuracy
Accuracy reflects the correctness of the data. Note that data that is valid
isn't necessarily accurate. For example, a valid hair color might be brown, but
if a person doesn't have brown hair, that is inaccurate data.
Uniqueness
Uniqueness measures whether the data is distinct with no duplicates.
Note: You can create a custom dimension name when you use the Google Cloud CLI or
the REST API to create a data scan. You can use dimension names that reflect
your organization's terminology. For example, instead of freshness, you might
use timeliness.
Typed input in rules
All value parameters are passed as string values to the API.
Dataplex Universal Catalog requires inputs to follow the
BigQuery specified format .
Binary-typed parameters can be passed as a base64-encoded string.

Data reference parameter
When you create a custom SQL rule, you can refer to a data source table and all
of its precondition filters by using the data reference parameter ${data()} in
the rule, instead of explicitly mentioning the source table and its filters.
Dataplex Universal Catalog interprets the parameter as a reference to the source
table and its filters. Examples of precondition filters include
row filters ,
sampling percents, and incremental filters.
For example, say that you have a data source table called
my_project_id.dim_dataset.dim_currency . You want to run an incremental data
quality scan that scans only on new daily data. A row filter that filters for
today's entries, transaction_timestamp >= current_date() , is applied on the
table.
A custom SQL rule to find rows with discount_pct for today looks like this:
discount_pct IN (SELECT discount_pct FROM my_project_id.dim_dataset.dim_currency WHERE transaction_timestamp >= current_date())
If you use the data reference parameter, you can simplify the rule. Replace the
mention of the table and its precondition filters with the ${data()}
parameter:
discount_pct IN (SELECT discount_pct FROM ${data()})
Dataplex Universal Catalog interprets the ${data()} parameter as a
reference to the data source table with today's entries,
my_project_id.dim_dataset.dim_currency WHERE transaction_timestamp >= current_date() .
In this example, the data reference parameter refers only to the incremental
data.
The ${data()} parameter is case sensitive.
When you use an alias within a subquery to refer to columns in the source table,
either use the data reference parameter to refer to the source table, or omit
the table reference. Don't refer to the columns in the source table by using a
direct table reference in the WHERE clause.
Recommended:
Use the data reference parameter to refer to the source table:
discount_pct IN (
SELECT discount_pct FROM
`my_project_id.dim_dataset.dim_currency` AS temp-table
WHERE
temp-table.transaction_timestamp = ${data()}.timestamp
)
Omit the table reference:
discount_pct IN (
SELECT discount_pct FROM
`another_project.another_dataset.another_table` AS temp-table
WHERE
temp-table.transaction_timestamp = timestamp
Not recommended:
Don't use a direct table reference to refer to columns in the source table:
discount_pct IN (
SELECT discount_pct FROM
`my_project_id.dim_dataset.dim_currency` AS temp-table
WHERE
temp-table.transaction_timestamp = `my_project_id.dim_dataset.dim_currency`.timestamp
)
Valid use of different tables:
You can use a direct table reference when comparing columns from a
different table:
discount_pct IN (
SELECT discount_pct FROM
`my_project_id.dim_dataset.dim_currency` AS temp-table
WHERE
temp-table.transaction_timestamp = `another_project.another_dataset.another_table`.timestamp
)
Debug queries
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
When you create a rule, you can optionally include a debug query to run
alongside the rule. A debug query is a SQL statement that returns up to 10
scalar values. These values can help diagnose the cause if the rule fails. You
can add at most one debug query per rule, and it must not exceed 1024 characters
in length.
Consider the following SQL assertion rule on the
example_project.example_dataset.table table that checks whether the average
revenue per item exceeds 100:
SELECT
*
FROM
` example_project . example_dataset . table `
WHERE
SUM ( revenue ) / COUNT ( DISTINCT item_id ) > 100
If the preceding rule fails, you can view metrics such as total revenue,
number of distinct items, and average revenue per item to help diagnose the
issue. The following debug query returns these metrics:
SELECT
SUM ( revenue ),
COUNT ( DISTINCT item_id ),
SUM ( revenue ) / COUNT ( DISTINCT item_id )
FROM ` example_project . example_dataset . table `
Rule execution
You can schedule data quality scans to run at a specific interval, or you can
run a scan on demand.
When you run a data quality scan, Dataplex Universal Catalog creates a job. As part
of the specification of a data quality scan, you can specify the scope of a job
to be one of the following:
Full Table
Each job validates the entire table.
Incremental
Each job validates incremental data. To
determine increments, provide a Date / Timestamp column in the
table that can be used as a marker. Typically, this is the column on which the
table is partitioned.
Filter data
You can filter data to be scanned for data quality by using a
row filter. Creating a row filter lets you focus on data within a specific
time period or specific segment, such as a certain region. Using filters can
reduce the run time and cost. For example, you can filter out data with a timestamp
before a certain date.
Sample data
You can specify a percentage of records from your data
to sample for running a data quality scan. Creating data quality scans on a
smaller sample of data can reduce the run time and the cost relative to
querying the entire dataset.
Data quality scan results
The results of your data quality scans are available in Dataplex Universal Catalog
and BigQuery.
You can also review and analyze the scan results by using the following methods:
Export results to BigQuery
You can export the scan results to a BigQuery table for further
analysis. To customize reporting, you can connect the BigQuery
table data to a Looker dashboard. You can build an aggregated report
by using the same results table across multiple scans.
Publish results as Dataplex Universal Catalog metadata
You can publish the data quality scan results as
Dataplex Universal Catalog metadata. The latest results are saved to the
Dataplex Universal Catalog entry that represents the source table, under the
data-quality-scorecard system aspect type. You can view the results on the
source table's BigQuery and Dataplex Universal Catalog pages in
the Google Cloud console, on the Data quality tab. You can also retrieve
the results by using the API.
Note: If an existing data quality scan published the results to the
BigQuery and Dataplex Universal Catalog pages in the
Google Cloud console, and you instead want to publish future scan results as
Dataplex Universal Catalog metadata, you must edit the scan to
re-enable publishing.
For more information about Dataplex Universal Catalog metadata, see
About metadata management in Dataplex Universal Catalog .
Review data quality scores
Each scan result provides data quality scores that indicate the percentage of
rules that passed. The scores are reported at the overall job level, the column
level (if the rule is evaluated against a column), and the dimension level. Use
the data quality scores to normalize data quality across tables or columns,
track trends, and identify data that doesn't meet quality requirements.
For more information, see
View the data quality scan results .
Monitoring and alerting
You can monitor and get alerts about data quality scans by using the following
methods:
Set alerts in Cloud Logging
You can monitor the data quality jobs using the data_scan and
data_quality_scan_rule_result logs in the Logs Explorer.
For each data quality job, the data_scan log with the data_scan_type field
set to DATA_QUALITY contains the following information:
Data source used for the data scan.
Job execution details, such as creation time, start time, end time, and
job state.
Result of the data quality job: pass or fail.
Dimension level pass or fail.
Every succeeded job contains a data_quality_scan_rule_result
log with the following detailed information about each rule in that job:
Configuration information, such as rule name, rule type, evaluation type,
and dimension.
Result information, such as pass or failure, total row count, passing row
count, null row count, and evaluated row count.
The information in the logs is available through the API and
Google Cloud console. You can use this information to set up alerts. For
more information, see
Set alerts in Logging .
Note: For the latest successful job, this information is also available in the
parent data quality scan.
Send email notification reports
You can send email notification reports to alert people about the status and
results of a data quality job. Notification reports are available for the
following scenarios:
The data quality score is lower than a specified target score
The job failed
The job finished
You configure notification reports when you
create a data quality scan .
Troubleshoot data quality failures
When a rule execution fails, Dataplex Universal Catalog
provides a query to get the failed records. Run this query to see the records
that didn't match your rule. For more information, see
Troubleshoot a data quality failure .
Note: The query returns all of the columns of the table, including the failed
column.
Limitations
Rule recommendations aren't supported in the gcloud CLI.
The choice of dimensions is fixed to one of the predefined seven dimensions.
The number of rules per data quality scan is limited to 1000.
Data quality scores that are reported at the column level are supported
only in the API.
