Request body
Response body
JSON representation

HTTP request
GET https://cloudcommerceprocurement.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=providers/*}/entitlements
The URL uses gRPC Transcoding syntax.
Path parameters
Parameters
parent
string
Required. The parent resource name.
Authorization requires the following IAM permission on the specified resource parent :
commerceprocurement.providerEntitlements.list
Query parameters
Parameters
filter
string
The filter that can be used to limit the list request.
The filter is a query string that can match a selected set of attributes with string values. For example account=E-1234-5678-ABCD-EFGH , state=pending_cancellation , and plan!=foo-plan . Supported query attributes are
account
customer_billing_account with value in the format of: billingAccounts/{id}
productExternalName
quoteExternalName
offer
newPendingOffer
plan
newPendingPlan or newPendingPlan
state
consumers.project
changeHistory.new_offer
Note that the consumers and changeHistory.new_offer match works on repeated structures, so equality ( consumers.project=projects/123456789 ) is not supported. Set membership can be expressed with the : operator. For example, consumers.project:projects/123456789 finds entitlements with at least one consumer with project field equal to projects/123456789 . changeHistory.new_offer retrieves all entitlements that were once associated or are currently active with the offer.
Also note that the state name match is case-insensitive and query can omit the prefix "ENTITLEMENT_". For example, state=active is equivalent to state=ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE .
If the query contains some special characters other than letters, underscore, or digits, the phrase must be quoted with double quotes. For example, product="providerId:productId" , where the product name needs to be quoted because it contains special character colon.
Queries can be combined with AND , OR , and NOT to form more complex queries. They can also be grouped to force a desired evaluation order. For example, state=active AND (account=E-1234 OR account=5678) AND NOT
(product=foo-product) . Connective AND can be omitted between two predicates. For example account=E-1234 state=active is equivalent to account=E-1234 AND state=active .
