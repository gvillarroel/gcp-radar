Announcement
The discovery client 6.3.13 is
available with a new feature and a bug fix.
Feature
Preview: Added support for discovery of the following assets
from your AWS account:
Amazon API Gateway
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
AWS AppSync

Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
For more information, see Discover assets on AWS
and Directly import asset inventory data from AWS .
Fixed
Fixed an issue where some supported operating systems from the
vSphere guest OS list
were missing from the discovered assets. The discovery client now uses the
VMware vSphere API to collect all supported OS families.
February 26, 2026
Feature
Preview: When visualizing network dependencies in
Migration Center, you can now tag assets and filter the
dependency graph based on groups, network, and asset details.
For more information, see Visualize network dependencies .
February 02, 2026
Feature
Migration Center now lets you configure sizing
recommendations for your migrated assets. You can define a target sizing
strategy, set default utilization estimates for assets that lack performance
data, and specify network data transfer out preferences to better estimate
your total cost of ownership (TCO).
For more information, see Sizing and network preferences .
Feature
When configuring migration preferences for Compute Engine, you can now select between Multi-tenant (default) or Sole-tenant
preference modes.
For more information, see
Google Compute Engine preferences .
January 26, 2026
Announcement
The discovery client 6.3.12 is
available with a bug fix.
Fixed
Fixed a bug in the MCDC guest collection script.
The guest collection process no longer runs Java or application binaries
(Tomcat and JBoss) on target servers. Version identification for Tomcat
and JBoss now relies exclusively on static configuration and the
release notes.
January 07, 2026
Announcement
The discovery client 6.3.11 is
available with new features and bug fixes.
Feature
The Migration Center discovery client CLI ( mcdc CLI) now uses
remote WMI collections by default for Windows guest host collections to improve
efficiency. This method replaces the use of local collection scripts.
If script-based collection is required for earlier Windows versions
(such as Windows Server 2008), you can deactivate this functionality
with the --script flag.
For more information, see
Collect data remotely over WMI .
Fixed
Fixed an issue in the Migration Center discovery client
CLI where region filtering for S3 assets during AWS inventory discovery
failed, resulting in asset collection from all regions instead of only
specified regions.
Fixed
Fixed an issue where adding vCenter credentials in the
Migration Center discovery client UI
redirected users to the dashboard instead of opening the
credentials pane.
Fixed
Fixed a bug that caused the discovery client not to use the provided proxy when
connecting to Migration Center.
December 17, 2025
Feature
Preview: Migration Center now lets you visualize
network dependencies between your discovered server assets. You can view a
graph of network connections for specific groups or a subset of servers
to better understand your infrastructure and plan your application
migration.
For more information, see Visualize network dependencies .
December 10, 2025
Announcement
The discovery client 6.3.10 is
available with a bug fix.
Fixed
Fixed a bug in the MCDC guest collection script.

Feature
Preview: Migration Center now provides more granular
storage preferences for Compute Engine. You can now specify your
preference for using Hyperdisk Storage Pools to reduce
costs and improve operational efficiency.
For more information, see
Migration preferences for servers .
Issue
If you select sole-tenant nodes as your migration target, Migration Center
always recommends Hyperdisk Storage Pools even if they are
more expensive than individual Hyperdisk volumes. When migrating
to sole-tenant nodes, we recommend that you select Never in the
Hyperdisk Storage Pools section of your preferences.
For more information, see
Migration preferences for servers .
November 10, 2025

warning or error . The status is now correctly cleared when a new
collection job begins.
Fixed
Fixed an issue that prevented the mcdc discover ls command from displaying IP
addresses.
October 29, 2025
Feature
C/C++ application migration to Arm architecture assessment. The App
Modernization Assessment tool now offers a dedicated assessment for C/C++
applications to facilitate their migration to Arm-based architectures (such as
Google Cloud Axion C4A VMs). This new feature helps you do the following:
Assess readiness: understand the effort and readiness required to
transition your C/C++ applications from x86-based architectures to Arm.
Identify key challenges: pinpoint potential code portability issues,
architecture-specific dependencies, and necessary build system modifications.
Plan for success: gain insights into testing considerations crucial
for a smooth and successful migration to Arm, whether on Google Cloud or
other cloud providers like AWS Graviton instances.
Feature
Enhanced productivity with command-line completion. The codmod tool now
supports shell command-line completion for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell,
significantly boosting your productivity. This feature lets you quickly
type commands, flags, and arguments by pressing the TAB key to see and
select the available options.
With this feature, you can discover options and see valid flag values.
Additionally, suggestions are context-aware, meaning completions are tailored to
the specific command.
For example, codmod config set [TAB] suggests config keys,
and file path completion is exclusively available for file and directory flags.
For additional details, see
Command-line completion .
Feature
Automatic version check and updates. The codmod tool now includes an
automatic version check feature to help you stay up-to-date with the latest
improvements and fixes. Every 24 hours, the codmod tool checks for the
availability of a newer version. If an update is available, a notification
message appears in your terminal with the new version number and a download
link.
You can disable the automatic check at any time using the following command:
codmod config set disable_version_check true .
To re-enable automatic checks, simply set the value back to false .
You can always view the current state and other configurations by running
codmod config list .
Feature
Supporting documents for assessment. The codmod tool can now analyze
a directory containing additional supporting documents to the codebase.
The codmod tool supports documentation in textual, PDF, and image (PNG, JPG,
JPEG) formats.
Provide the directory by passing the --supporting-documents <directory> flag
to the create command.

Feature
The Migration Center discovery client CLI ( mcdc CLI) supports the offline assessment of migrating VMs running on VMWare vSphere to VMs running on Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) air-gapped .
The mcdc CLI now assesses the migration fit of VMware VMs to Google Distributed Cloud air-gapped with a journey called "Shift | Google Distributed Cloud". This journey is available in all report formats by default. To generate a report focused on applicable journeys to GDC including existing containerization journeys, run the following command using the mcdc CLI for Linux or Windows:
./mcdc report --format FORMAT --target-platform gdc --file REPORT_NAME
For more information, see Offline assessment rules .
Issue
The following are open known issues with the Migration Center discovery client 6.2.0:
The maximum number of scanned servers is limited to a total of 2,000 servers. Exceeding this limit may cause instability.
Opting out from analytics and Cloud Logging can only be done from the Settings page of the discovery client application.
In some cases, the discovery client service might not run after boot, and users would get a "connection refused" error when opening the discovery client application. A workaround is to configure the discovery client service to have a delayed start.
