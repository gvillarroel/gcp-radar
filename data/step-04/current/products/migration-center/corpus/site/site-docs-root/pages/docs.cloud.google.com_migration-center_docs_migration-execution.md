Execute your migration
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
After planning your migration ,
you can continue to the execution phase.
This and the following documents provide you with a synthesis of the methods
and tools you can use to execute your migration.
Before you begin
Ensure that you have completed the following tasks:
Discover your assets .
Assess your infrastructure .
Plan your migration .
Review the Enterprise foundations blueprint and
landing zone design .
Initial migration preparation
The cloud migration project is the major organizational effort that drives
the migration of your workloads to Google Cloud.
Each migration project is divided into waves . A wave is a group of
applications that share common characteristics or interdependencies, as
identified by the workload discovery and assessment. Standalone applications and
databases are typically good candidates for a first migration wave given their
low external dependencies.
On the other hand, workloads with significant interdependencies
would constitute a complex migration wave that requires additional planning.
In this case, you need to refine the migration plan to review the business
impact of interdependencies, and remove the blockers that potentially
prevent the migration.
Workloads within a migration wave are divided into move groups and migrated
to Google Cloud in sprints .
A move group is a group of infrastructure
resources and workloads that you need to migrate together—these can be part of
the same application or a group of applications that are interdependent.
During every sprint, you need to perform the following actions:
Prepare and integrate the tools required for migration.
Develop a sprint plan.
Execute the sprint plan.
Migration process and methodology
Sprint planning and playbook
In the sprint plan, define how you are going to execute the migration waves
categorized into a sprint. Create a playbook by addressing the following
building blocks.

Migration execution
After you have completed the migration planning and preparation phase,
this section describes how to perform repeatable migrations
and validations to Google Cloud.
Assess
The first iteration of assessment happens during the migration planning phase,
and produces data on dependencies between workloads and
infrastructure components.
You must continue to perform discovery and assessment throughout your
cloud migration project to
recalibrate and enrich data relating to the following aspects:
Application and database mapping to infrastructure mapping (to identify
all of the infrastructure and platform components for a business workload)
Mapping between infrastructure to applications, databases, and services
(to identify
all of the business workloads attached to an infrastructure or
platform component)
Dependencies across business workloads
Resource consumption by workloads
Identification of any workloads that were not discovered in the initial
wave of assessment
Identification of new or changed landing zone requirements that have not
been identified in the initial wave of assessment
Identification of blocking issues that potentially prevent the migration
An ongoing assessment is critical to continuously calibrate and refine
move group, identify and mitigate risks, and refine and optimize migration
wave plans.
Plan
The planning phase in a migration wave aims at defining the final scope of the
sprints within a wave, and consolidates the component-specific migration plans
into a single plan.
The outputs of this phase are the following:
Move group(s) within the scope of the current sprint
Migration sprint checklist
Mitigations to remediate blocking issues
Migrate, build, test, and deployment plan
Rollback plan
Scheduling of execution
Low-level detailed planning is critical for a successful deployment that
follows.
Deploy
During the deployment phase, your migration team
executes the migration plan and removes any critical issues.
It is recommended to set up regular status meetings
to track the execution plan. These status meetings, however, should not be used
to troubleshoot issues.
Instead, set up separate, dedicated sessions with respective technical
experts.
The outputs of the deployment phase are the following:
Migration plan updates (status per step, notes)
Migration issue tracker updates
Post-migration test results
CMDB updates (if applicable)
Migration results communication to stakeholders
If the deployment is unsuccessful, for example, if the migration plan fails,
the tests fail or the fix is impossible within the defined migration timeframe,
you need to execute the rollback plan.
It is advised to run application tests after the rollback
and ensure any external changes that were part of the migration plan,
such as upstream and downstream systems configuration, are rolled back as well.
Optimize
The optimization phase lets your project team regroup after completing the
deployment phase to document the lessons learned and implement
improvements for the following waves and sprints.
For the scope that has already
been migrated, the optimization phase can be used to resolve non-critical
post-migration issues.
This phase is important as it enables continuous improvement throughout the
project timeline.
The outputs of the phase are the following:
Migration issue tracker updates
Project knowledge base updates, if applicable
Migration tools
Automation tools play an important role in the migration lifecycle.
During the execution phase of your migration, you need to create an
architecture of automation tools based on a number of factors, such as the
type of workloads to be migrated, geographical distribution and rollout
strategy, and security requirements.
The following documents present several automation tools that address the
following capabilities:
Migration and modernization tools
Build and CI/CD automation tools
Testing tools
