Generate and analyze network dependencies report
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to generate and analyze the network dependencies
report in Migration Center. The network dependencies report provides
monthly aggregated data about the connections to your servers and databases.
The network dependencies report lets you see all the connections to the assets
in your infrastructure, and the number of times the connection is observed by
Migration Center, aggregated monthly.
To collect network dependencies data, let the
discovery client
run for a period of time and enable syncing the data with Migration Center.
The longer you run the collection, the more data Migration Center
has to analyze insights on your network dependencies. Migration Center
then identifies all the network connections from the scanned assets. The target
assets in a connection can be assets in your Migration Center
inventory that you discovered with the discovery client, assets that
you manually imported, or even unknown assets that are external to your
environment.
The network dependencies report is useful in the following scenarios:
Collecting data about connections to servers and databases,
to identify assets that belong to the same application
Identifying network connections of interest within a group of assets, such as
all the servers using the MySQL standard port
Identifying missing assets in your inventory
You can download the network dependencies report as a CSV file from
Migration Center. You can then perform your analysis using
BigQuery and the sample queries provided by Migration Center,
or use any other third-party tool.
Limitations
To collect connection data in your infrastructure, you must use the
discovery client.
Network connections data is collected only with the OS scan method only.
The vSphere scan doesn't support network data collection.
Before you begin
Before you create a network dependencies report, you must have performance
collection working with the discovery client.
Before you analyze the network dependencies report with BigQuery,
do the following:
Learn how to
import local data to BigQuery .
Learn how to
run queries .
Generate a network dependencies report
To generate a network dependencies report, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create reports page.
Go to Create reports
Click Network dependencies exports .
From the list of groups, select the groups for which you want to generate
the report, then click Export .
In the dialog that appears, click Export .
The exported report might take up to an hour to be generated. After your
report is generated, the Network dependencies page opens.
Note: Migration Center stores up to six months of data. Each
connection is aggregated by month. The ConnectionCount column
in the report represents the number of times Migration Center
observed the connection each month.
To download a specific report, click download Download .
Analyze the network dependencies report in BigQuery
The following sections provide you with some sample queries to analyze
common scenarios in BigQuery. Before you can run a query, you
must upload your CSV file to BigQuery .
To use BigQuery, you are billed according to the
BigQuery pricing .
Identify assets with most connections
The following query is useful to identify the assets that have the largest
number of connections in the group.
SELECT
LocalVMName , SUM ( ConnectionCount ) as TotalCount
FROM
PROJECT . DATASET . TABLE
GROUP BY ALL
ORDER BY TotalCount DESC
Replace the following:
PROJECT : the Google Cloud project where you
uploaded the CSV file.
DATASET : the BigQuery dataset.
TABLE : the BigQuery table.
The following is a sample output from this query:
LocalVMName
TotalCount
VM-x5ua3o2w
9970
VM-glg5np3w
9763
VM-q3z4zfp8
9557
VM-2nnsrt37
9372
VM-1oah56hn
9350
Identify connections by graph's depth
The following query is useful to identify all the assets that connect to
a given one with a specific number of intermediate connections. For example:
With graph depth equal to 1, you find all the assets directly connected
to the main asset.
With graph depth equal to 2, you find all the assets directly connected
to other assets, which are in turn directly connected to the main asset.
DECLARE
local_vm_name STRING DEFAULT MAIN_ASSET ;
DECLARE
depth INT64 DEFAULT DEPTH ;
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION
recursiveConnections ( localVmName STRING ,
connectionsArray ARRAY<STRING> ,
depth INT64 )
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE js AS r """
const connections = connectionsArray.map(connection => connection.split('|||'))
.filter(connectionTuple => connectionTuple[1] !== 'Unscanned Device');
const connectedAssets = new Set([localVmName]);
for (let i = 0; i < depth; i++) {
const currentSet = new Set(connectedAssets);
for (const connection of connections) {
/* Look for connections where the asset is the local asset */
if (currentSet.has(connection[0])) {
connectedAssets.add(connection[1]);
}
/* Look for connections where the asset is the remote asset */
if (currentSet.has(connection[1])) {
connectedAssets.add(connection[0]);
}
}
}
connectedAssets.delete(localVmName);
return Array.from(connectedAssets).sort().join(', ');
""" ;
SELECT
local_vm_name AS LocalVMName ,
recursiveConnections ( local_vm_name ,
ARRAY_AGG ( CONCAT ( LocalVMName , '|||' , RemoteVMName )),
depth ) AS Connections
FROM
PROJECT . DATASET . TABLE
Replace the following:
MAIN_ASSET : The name of the asset for which you want
to identify the connections.
DEPTH : The depth of the graph.
The following is a sample output from this query:
LocalVMName
Connections
VM-lv8s148f
VM-2z8wp3ey,
VM-66rq2x2y,
VM-94uwyy8h,
VM-ccgmqqmb,
VM-ctqddf0u,
VM-og4n77lb,
...
Filter connections by IP and port ranges
The following query lets you identify assets that use IP addresses and ports
in ranges that you define.
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION
ipBetween ( value STRING ,
low STRING ,
high STRING ) AS ( NET . IPV4_TO_INT64 ( NET . IP_FROM_STRING ( value )) BETWEEN NET . IPV4_TO_INT64 ( NET . IP_FROM_STRING ( low ))
AND NET . IPV4_TO_INT64 ( NET . IP_FROM_STRING ( high )) );
SELECT
*
FROM
PROJECT . DATASET . TABLE
WHERE
(( LocalPort BETWEEN PORT_START
AND PORT_END )
OR ( RemotePort BETWEEN PORT_START
AND PORT_END ))
AND ( ipBetween ( LocalIP ,
IP_START ,
IP_END )
OR ipBetween ( RemoteIP ,
IP_START ,
IP_END ))
Replace the following:
PORT_START : The initial port of the port range,
for example 0 .
PORT_END : The final port of the port range,
for example 1024 .
IP_START : The initial IP address of the range,
for example "10.26.0.0" .
IP_END : The final IP address of the range,
for example "10.26.255.255" .
The following is a sample output from this query:
SampleRange
LocalVMName
LocalAssetID
LocalGroups
LocalIP
LocalPort
Protocol
LocalProcessName
RemoteVMName
RemoteAssetID
RemoteGroups
RemoteIP
RemotePort

Identify unscanned assets in the network
The following query lets you identify any unscanned asset in your network.
An unscanned asset is a connection to a remote IP address that is not
associated to any asset in your Migration Center inventory.
This lets you identify potentially missing assets that you need
to scan for your assessment.
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION
ipBetween ( value STRING ,
low STRING ,
high STRING ) AS ( NET . IPV4_TO_INT64 ( NET . IP_FROM_STRING ( value )) BETWEEN NET . IPV4_TO_INT64 ( NET . IP_FROM_STRING ( low ))
AND NET . IPV4_TO_INT64 ( NET . IP_FROM_STRING ( high )) );
SELECT
STRING_AGG ( LocalIP , ', ' ) AS LocalIPs ,
RemoteIP
FROM
PROJECT . DATASET . TABLE
WHERE
RemoteVMName = 'Unscanned Device'
AND ipBetween ( LocalIP ,
IP_START ,
IP_END )
AND ipBetween ( RemoteIP ,
IP_START ,
IP_END )
GROUP BY
RemoteIP
Replace the following:
IP_START : The initial IP address of the range,
for example "10.26.0.0" .
IP_END : The final IP address of the range,
for example "10.26.255.255" .
