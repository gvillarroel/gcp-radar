The Migration Center App Modernization Assessment ( codmod ) is an
AI-powered tool that automates the modernization assessment process for your
application. This page outlines the steps to install, use, and troubleshoot the
codmod tool.
About App Modernization Assessment
The typical modernization assessment process takes a few weeks and requires a
lot of expertise. By automating this process, the codmod tool significantly
reduces this time to a few hours.
This tool aims to provide evidence-based information about the current
application's architecture, functionality, and potential blockers that might
slow the transformation to the cloud.
This tool is intended for the following roles:
IT architects
Decision makers
Application owners
The codmod tool aims to expedite application transformation by providing
clear visibility into the required changes, and the benefits gained from
transforming the application to Google Cloud. The codmod is a portable CLI
tool that uses Gemini to analyze source code and provides
recommendations based on Google Cloud best practices.
Note: The codmod tool sends your code to Vertex AI. Your code is
not used for training, and by default your code is not stored anywhere. For
further reading see:
How Gemini for Google Cloud uses your data .
Before you begin
The codmod tool requires the following prerequisites:
A Linux or Windows (10 or newer) workstation.
Access to a Google Cloud project that has the Vertex AI API
enabled.
A gcloud CLI installation on your workstation. For more
information, see
Install the gcloud CLI CLI .
Pricing
The cost of using Gemini for code assessment is primarily driven by
the size of the codebase, and is measured in tokens. The following table shows
the costs estimates that you can expect to see based on your lines of code and
the model that you choose:
Codebase
Lines of Code (LOC)
Estimated Cost
adaptive
2.0-flash
2.5-pro (default)
2.5-flash
Spring
Petclinic
~6,500
$20
$2
$30
$4
James Project
~1,000,000
$60
$30
$500
$40
Elasticsearch
~5,000,000
$200
$200
$3000
$200
These values might be an overestimate because they don't take into account
possible savings due to the following:
Reduced pricing for short queries.
Reduced pricing for implicit caching.
Committed use discounts (CUDs).
Costs for these parameters are expected to be a negligible part of the total
cost, especially for larger codebases. For additional information, see
Gemini API pricing .
Additional information
The tool uses the Vertex AI API's advanced code understanding and
analysis capabilities. For more information about the available models and
their features, see
Google models
in the Vertex AI API documentation.
To maintain optimal performance and cost efficiency, codmod has a codebase
size limit of approximately 6 million lines of code.
For codebases exceeding this limit, we recommend dividing them into
smaller, manageable parts for analysis. Analyzing smaller sections can
also help in more focused assessments and potentially reduce overall processing
time.

Set up codmod
This section provides installation and authentication instructions to use the
codmod tool.
Install codmod
Windows
Run the following command in Windows PowerShell to download the latest
version of codmod :
$version = curl . exe -s https :// codmod-release . storage . googleapis . com / latest
curl . exe -O "https://codmod-release.storage.googleapis.com/${version}/windows/amd64/codmod.exe"
Linux
Run the following command to download the latest version of codmod :
version = $( curl -s https://codmod-release.storage.googleapis.com/latest )
curl -O "https://codmod-release.storage.googleapis.com/ ${ version } /linux/amd64/codmod"
chmod +x codmod
To use the codmod command, add the executable to path, or create an alias.
Authenticate to Google Cloud
To use the codmod tool, you need a Google Cloud project.
Ensure the Vertex AI API is enabled on the project in the
console
or using the CLI:
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com --project <project-id>
Ensure you have roles/aiplatform.user role or similar on the project.
To authenticate, run the following command:
gcloud auth application-default login
Alternatively, you can use a service account and set the
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable. To learn more, see
How Application Default Credentials works .
Manage the codmod configuration
The following sections explain how to configure codmod with the
codmod config command.
List all settings
To see all current configuration properties and their values, run the
following command:
codmod config list
Set a default value for a flag
To set a default value for a property, use the set command. For example,
to set the default project ID, run:
codmod config set project " PROJECT_ID "
Replace PROJECT_ID with the Google Cloud project ID.
To set the default region, run:
codmod config set region " REGION "
Replace REGION with the Google Cloud region. See the
list of available regions .
If you are unsure of which region to use, use us-central1 .
Get a specific value
To view the value of a single property, use the get command. For example,
to get the configured project ID, run the following command:
codmod config get project
Unset a default value
To remove a configured default and revert to the tool's original default
setting, use the unset command. For example, to remove the default project
ID, run the following command:
codmod config unset project
Create a codmod assessment report
The following sections describe how to create the default assessment and how
to customize it according to your needs.
Create the default report
To create an assessment report, run the codmod tool with the following
flags:
codmod create -c " CODEBASE " -o " OUTPUT "
Replace the following:
CODEBASE : specifies the directory that contains the
source code to analyze, and can be specified multiple times.
OUTPUT : specifies the path where the generated report is
saved. The report is in HTML format.
You can override the default project and region with the
-p " PROJECT_ID " and -r " REGION " flags,
respectively.
You can also specify the following optional flags:
--modelset [2.0-flash|2.5-flash|2.5-pro|adaptive] :
specifies which Gemini models to use. The default value is
2.5-pro . Adaptive provides a significant cost reduction with a
potential trade-off in report quality compared to 2.5-pro .
--format <html|markdown|odt|json> : the format used for the generated
report. The default is HTML.
--allow-large-codebase : by default codmod will ask for
confirmation before analyzing on codebases larger than 1 million lines of
code - to avoid high costs. This option serves as a non-interactive
confirmation. You can also enable this by default by running
codmod config set allow_large_codebase true .
--improve-fidelity : when set, codmod generates sections serially
instead of in parallel. This improves consistency between different
sections of the final report, but requires a longer run time.
--force-include <strings> , --force-exclude <strings> : by default,
codmod scans popular file extensions including Java, .NET, and Python.
Use these flags to include or exclude file extensions. The argument must be
a regular expression with the RE2 syntax.
--experiments : specify --experiments=enable_pdf,enable_images to
support PDFs and images in codmod .
--context <string> : any additional context that you want to provide
about the project. The tool takes this context into consideration when
generating the report.
--context-file <path> : same as --context where the context is
provided in the given file.
--supporting-documents <path> : specifies a directory of supporting
documentation about the codebase. Files in this directory can be referenced
from the context provided with the --context or --context-file flags
to be included in the analysis.
Supported formats include text, PDF, and images (PNG, JPG, JPEG).
Create a full report
If you need a full analysis, create a report using the create full command:
codmod create full -c "~/mycodebase/" -o "report.html"
Create a report focused on data layer
If a deeper attention to the data layer is required, a report can be created
with focus on this area:
codmod create data-layer -c " CODEBASE " -o " OUTPUT "
Create a report for a specific transformation intent
If you want to focus the report towards a particular modernization intent, you
can use one of the following supported intents:
Microsoft workload transformation ( MICROSOFT_MODERNIZATION ): use
with applications running on Microsoft OS, the assessment will focus around
transformation journeys that will modernize frameworks based on .NET to use
the latest version and reduce the dependencies on Microsoft licenses.
Cloud to cloud workload transformation ( CLOUD_TO_CLOUD ): use with
applications running on other hyperscaler infrastructure. The
assessment will focus on the recommended changes for transforming the
application, such as mapping other cloud vendor services to
Google Cloud services.
Legacy Java transformation ( JAVA_LEGACY_TO_MODERN ): use with
applications running Java version Java 8 or similar , the
assessment will focus on finding upgrade dependencies and areas in the code
impacted from the change to Java 21 (the current LTS) .
Legacy Java WILDFLY transformation ( WILDFLY_LEGACY_TO_MODERN ): use
with Java EE/Jakarta EE codebases running on WildFly application
server versions prior to the latest. The assessment will focus on
identifying upgrade dependencies and areas in the code impacted by the
WildFly application server version upgrade, including changes required for
API differences and compatibility.
C/C++ application to Arm architecture migration ( ARM_MIGRATION ):
use with C/C++ applications
to assess their readiness and the effort required to migrate from x86-based
architectures to Arm-based architectures, such as Google Cloud Axion C4A
VMs. The assessment focuses on identifying potential code portability
issues, architecture-specific dependencies, build system modifications, and
testing considerations necessary for a successful transition to Arm from
Google Cloud or another CSP like AWS's Graviton instances.
To create an intent-focused report, use the --intent flag:
codmod create -c " CODEBASE " -o " OUTPUT " --intent " INTENT "
Create a report with additional sections
The tool supports including additional sections which are not included by
default to reduce costs. The following sections are supported:
files : a structured hierarchical view of project folders and
description per each folder content to help you orient yourself on the
project files.
classes : a catalog of code classes with information about each class
and its dependencies on other classes. The supported languages are
Java and C#.
To create the additional sections, use the --optional-sections flag:
codmod create -c " CODEBASE " -o " OUTPUT " --optional-sections " SECTIONS "
Replace SECTIONS with a comma-separated list of values.
Create a custom report
If you want to explore some specific custom topics, you can create a custom
report based on the context you provide using the following command:
codmod create custom -c " CODEBASE " -o " OUTPUT " --context " CONTEXT "
By default, an LLM is used to expand upon the provided context and
adapt it to ensure that a coherent section is generated. You can disable this
behavior by specifying --improve-context=false .
Additional flags:
--from-template <path> : specifies a template file that defines the
document structure in either text or PDF file format. codmod
detects the structure and asks for approval to continue generating the
report.
--skip-template-approval : skips the approval request when using the
--from-template flag.
Modify an existing report
You can create a new section in a report or modify an existing section
based on an specific section. For example, you might want to focus on a
particular aspect of the system's architecture, or a particular type of security
vulnerability.
Commands that modify a report will require the following flags:
One of --context and --context-file : specify the modification request.
--from-report : specifies the path for the existing report file.
--from-section : name of the section to be used as a basis for a new
section (for example "Overview", or "Architecture").
To display all the available sections in a specific report, run the following
command:
codmod list-sections --from-report " REPORT "
Revise a report section
Modify an existing section by running the following command:
codmod revise section -c " CODEBASE " --from-report " REPORT " \
-o " REVISED_REPORT " --from-section " SECTION_NAME " \
--context " CONTEXT "
Note: The "Summary", "Further Analysis", "Files", and "Classes" sections
are not supported with the revise section command.
Create a new report section
Create a new section using the following command:
codmod create section -c " CODEBASE " --from-report " REPORT " \
-o " REGENERATED_REPORT " --from-section " SECTION_NAME " \
--context " CONTEXT "
The from-section flag in the create section command is optional.
By default an LLM is used to expand upon the provided context and
adapt it to ensure a coherent section is generated. You may disable this
behavior by specifying --improve-context=false .
Note the following:
create section and revise section only support the html report format.
create section , revise section , list-sections expect the --from-report
flag to point to a report in the HTML format.
Estimate assessment costs
The codmod tool helps you understand the cost of using the tool by letting
you calculate the approximate cost of creating a report. To view your cost
estimate, run the following command:
codmod create --estimate-cost -c " CODEBASE "
Cost estimates are not supported for the create section and create custom
commands.
Set the verbosity level
The codmod verbosity is configured using the
--verbosity LEVEL flag.
The verbosity level of the logs is one of the following: debug , info ,
warn , error , or none . The default value is warn .
Check and update the codmod CLI version
The codmod CLI can automatically check if a newer version is available.
Automatic checks
Every 24 hours, the CLI polls a Cloud Storage bucket to see if a
newer version of codmod has been released. If a newer version is found,
you will see a notification message on your terminal.
The message includes the new version number and a link to download the update.
This process helps ensure you can stay up-to-date with the latest features,
improvements, and bug fixes.
Disable version checks
If you prefer to disable the automatic version check, you can use the config
set command:
codmod config set disable_version_check true
To re-enable the version check, set the value back to false :
codmod config set disable_version_check false
You can view the current state of this setting and other configurations by
running:
codmod config list
Command-line completion
The codmod CLI tool supports shell command-line completion for Bash, Zsh,
Fish, and PowerShell. This feature helps you quickly type commands, flags, and
arguments by pressing the Tab key to see and select available options.
Autocompletion offers the following benefits:
Autocomplete commands and flags: start typing a codmod command
or flag and press Tab to see possible completions.
Discover options: see valid values for certain flags. For
example:
codmod create --modelset [TAB] suggests available model
sets (for example, 2.0-flash , 2.5-pro ).
codmod create --format [TAB] suggests output formats
(for example, html , json , markdown ).
codmod create --intent [TAB] suggests predefined intents.
Context-aware suggestions: completion is tailored to the command.
For example:
codmod config set [TAB] suggests the available
configuration keys you can set.
codmod config get [TAB] suggests the available
configuration keys you can get.
File path completion is only offered for flags or arguments that
expect a file or directory path (for example, --codebase , --output-path ).
Other flags, such as --project , no longer suggest file names.
Enable shell completion
Before you enable shell completion, make sure that the codmod command works
by adding the executable to path, or by creating an alias.
To load completions for your shell, run the appropriate command. The
instructions vary depending on your shell. Use the help command to get
specific instructions:
# For Bash
codmod completion bash --help
# For Zsh
codmod completion zsh --help
# For Fish
codmod completion fish --help
# For PowerShell
codmod completion powershell --help
For example, to load Bash completion on Linux, you might add the following to
your ~/.bashrc :
source < ( codmod completion bash )
Make sure to restart your shell or source your profile (for example, source
~/.bashrc ) for the changes to take effect.
Troubleshooting
Permission denied: if you encounter a "permission denied" error,
then ensure that you granted the execution permission to the codmod
binary by running the chmod +x codmod command.
CLI appears to hang: analysis can take a long time, but you can
typically see the progress in the progress bar in the CLI. If the progress
bar remains at 0% after 15 minutes, then verify that you have sufficient
quota for the relevant model. By default, codmod uses the
gemini-2.5-pro model. However, this is subject to change as different
modelsets use different models for different purposes.
