Run a guest discovery
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the steps to run the different guest discovery methods
that the mcdc CLI provides.
Guest discovery lets you scan and collect data about the running applications
on your machines, which includes both virtual machine (VM) instances and
physical servers. It also collects data about the machine configuration,
hardware, network, as well as open files, services, and processes.
For machines running on platforms for which the Migration Center discovery client CLI doesn't
support inventory discovery , such as machines
running on-premises, as well as for a full assessment of VMs running on
VMware, AWS, and Azure, you can run a guest discovery.
Guest discovery uses a guest collection script to collect data about the machine
and writes that data to a guest collection tar file for Linux machines, or zip
file for Windows machines.
The machine hosting the mcdc CLI uploads the script to the
target machine, runs it, and then downloads the results. You can run the script
locally on the target machine, or run it remotely. Depending on your
infrastructure, you can choose to use the mcdc CLI
in the following ways:
For Linux and Windows VMs deployed on VMware, the mcdc CLI
supports remote execution with the discover vsphere command.
For Linux machines accessible by the mcdc CLI, you
can perform a remote discovery using SSH with the discover ssh command.
For Windows machines accessible by the mcdc CLI, you
can perform a remote discovery using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
with the discover wmi command.
For Linux and Windows machines without connection to the
mcdc CLI, you can download and run the
guest collection scripts locally, and then manually import the collected
data to the machine that's hosting the mcdc CLI.
The guest collection script runs a series of commands to gather information
about the source machine and might also collect potentially
sensitive data such as command-line arguments, network information,
or environment variables and arguments in running processes.
Important: Sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) is
never sent to Google or other third party. The data remains on the machine
where it is collected during the mcdc CLI run.
Before you begin
Review the requirements for downloading and running the mcdc CLI .
Review the requirements for downloading and running the guest collection scripts .
Complete the steps to download mcdc CLI .
Collect data remotely using VMware tools
For VMs hosted on vSphere, the mcdc CLI can use VMware
tools to deploy and run the collection scripts remotely on both Linux and
Windows VMs. When using VMware tools, the mcdc CLI tool
does the following:
Uploads the collection script to the VM.
Runs the script on the VM.
Downloads and imports the results.
Two sets of credentials are required to collect data remotely:
The vCenter server username passed to the mcdc CLI to
connect to vSphere, which must have the following privileges on the VM:
Guest operation modifications
Guest operation program execution
Guest operation queries
User credentials for the VM:
On Windows, you must have administrator privileges.
On Linux, you can use root or non-root credentials. For more information,
see Guest discovery on Linux .
To collect data using VMware tools, follow these steps:
Sign in to your Linux VM that's hosting the mcdc CLI.
Change to the directory where you downloaded the mcdc CLI.
Ensure that the VM is powered on.
Run the guest discovery:
Linux
./mcdc discover vsphere guest --url https:// VSPHERE_URL -u VCENTER_USER --vm-user VM_USER VM_ID
Windows
mcdc.exe discover vsphere guest --url https:// VSPHERE_URL -u VCENTER_USER --vm-user VM_USER VM_ID
Replace the following:
VCENTER_USER : the vCenter server user
VM_USER : the VM user
VM_ID : the name of the VM or MOREF
Important: If the vSphere cluster has multiple data centers, then you must use
the --dc flag to specify the data center name.
When prompted, enter the password for the VCENTER_USER and
the VM_USER .
To collect data from multiple vSphere VMs in parallel using VMware tools,
follow these steps:
Important: All the VMs you want to collect from must have the same username and
password. If you have separate credentials for your Windows or Linux VMs,
then you can select an operating system using the --os-family flag.
Sign in to your Linux VM that's hosting the mcdc CLI.
Change to the directory where you downloaded the mcdc CLI.
Ensure that all VMs are powered on.
Run the guest discovery:
Linux
./mcdc discover vsphere guest all --url https:// VSPHERE_URL -u VCENTER_USER --vm-user VM_USER --timeout TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS
Windows
mcdc.exe discover vsphere guest all --url https:// VSPHERE_URL -u VCENTER_USER --vm-user VM_USER --timeout TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS
Replace TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS with the timeout in seconds.
Optionally, limit the discovery to only Windows or Linux VMs using the
--os-family flag, or change the level of parallelism using the
--max-parallelism flag.
When prompted, enter the password for the VCENTER_USER and
VM_USER .
You can also scope the discovery to specific VMs using the
--path flag, as described for VMware in Run an inventory discovery .
You can export and assess this collected data online in Migration Center,
or run an offline assessment.
Guest discovery on Linux
If you run guest discovery with root access (for example, by using sudo ),
mcdc CLI collects more data from your machine than if
you run it using non-root user credentials.
The following table compares the data collected by the guest discovery
script based on privilege level.

Collect data remotely over SSH
If the machine that's hosting the mcdc CLI has SSH access to
the target Linux machine (Windows machines are not supported), then the
mcdc CLI can connect to the target machine over SSH to
collect data.
When using SSH, the mcdc CLI does the following:
Uploads the collection script to the machine.
Runs the script on the machine with the machine user credentials passed to
the mcdc CLI.
Note: While the machine user credentials don't require root access, having
root access allows mcdc CLI to collect all
assessment data.
Downloads and imports the results.
Supported SSH modes
If you're using the mcdc CLI on a Linux machine,
you can use two modes to run SSH:
Default: uses the ssh binary and configurations on the
mcdc CLI machine. Default mode can use the local SSH
configuration files by default, such as ~/.ssh/config and
~/.ssh/known_hosts , of the workstation that's hosting it.
Enter the password when prompted, or use sshpass to pass the password
or private key file passphrase on the command line. For example:
sshpass -p password mcdc discover ssh IP_ADDRESS
Replace IP_ADDRESS with the IP address of the machine.
Embedded: uses the built-in SSH library. This mode lets you use
the embedded SSH client if default mode malfunctions in your environment.
However, it doesn't use the local SSH configuration files by default. You
can use the -i flag to specify an SSH private key file.
If you're using the mcdc CLI on a Windows machine,
only embedded mode is supported.
Run the collection
To collect data over SSH, follow these steps:
Sign in to the Linux machine that's hosting the mcdc CLI.
Change to the directory where you downloaded the mcdc CLI.
Collect data.
Linux
./mcdc discover ssh IP_HOSTNAME
Windows
mcdc.exe discover ssh IP_HOSTNAME
To discover and collect database assets, use the --db-engine flag:
Linux
./mcdc discover ssh IP_HOSTNAME --db-engine= DB_ENGINE
Windows
mcdc.exe discover ssh IP_HOSTNAME --db-engine= DB_ENGINE
Replace the following:
IP_HOSTNAME : the IP hostname of the machine.
DB_ENGINE : the database engine to collect. Supported values are
sqlserver , mysql , postgresql .
The SSH private key file of the user invoking the
mcdc CLI is used for SSH authentication.
When prompted, enter the username of an account on the Linux machine. The
collection script runs using these credentials. If the SSH private key of
the user invoking the mcdc CLI fails to authenticate
to the machine with the username, you're also prompted for a password.
Additional scenarios when using SSH
See the following scenarios where you might need to modify the command:
To specify the machine user with default mode, use the -u flag:
Linux
./mcdc discover ssh -u USER IP_HOSTNAME
Windows
mcdc.exe discover ssh -u USER IP_HOSTNAME
Replace USER with the machine user.
When prompted, enter the password for the user.
To specify verbose mode, use the -v flag:
Linux
./mcdc discover ssh -u USER -v IP_HOSTNAME
Windows
mcdc.exe discover ssh -u USER -v IP_HOSTNAME
To specify the SSH private key file, use the -i flag. For example, to specify .ssh/my_private_key :
Linux
./mcdc discover ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_private_key -u USER IP_HOSTNAME
Windows
mcdc.exe discover ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_private_key -u USER IP_HOSTNAME
To specify the password on the command line, use embedded mode:
Linux
./mcdc discover ssh --ssh-client embedded -u USER --passphrase PASSWORD IP_HOSTNAME
Windows
mcdc.exe discover ssh --ssh-client embedded -u USER --passphrase PASSWORD IP_HOSTNAME
Because the embedded form of the command doesn't use the local SSH
configuration files by default, ensure that the user you specify in the
command is able to access the machine over SSH and has privileges on the
machine to execute the collection script.
To specify the SSH private key file with embedded mode, use the -i flag:
Linux
./mcdc discover ssh --ssh-client embedded -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -u USER --password PASSWORD IP_HOSTNAME
Windows
mcdc.exe discover ssh --ssh-client embedded -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -u USER --password PASSWORD IP_HOSTNAME
The mcdc CLI command lets you specify most SSH flags.
It then passes these flags to the ssh command using the -a or
--ssh-args flag. For example, to use a socks proxy:
Linux
./mcdc discover ssh -u USER -a '-o' -a 'ProxyCommand=nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:proxy port %h %p' IP_HOSTNAME
Windows
mcdc.exe discover ssh -u USER -a '-o' -a 'ProxyCommand=nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:proxy port %h %p' IP_HOSTNAME
You can export and assess this collected data online in Migration Center,
or run an offline assessment.
Collect data on an individual Linux machine
To perform a guest collection locally on a Linux machine, you can run the
mcdc-linux-collect.sh script.
Then, you can copy the tar file generated by the script into the machine that
hosts the mcdc CLI, and import it with the
discover import command.
If you want to collect all the possible data from your Linux machine, run the
script with root access using sudo . If you run it with user privileges,
mcdc CLI collects a more limited set of data.
For more information, see Guest discovery on Linux .
Sign in to your machine.
Change to the directory where you downloaded the guest collection script.
Run the collection script on the machine:
To run with root access:
sudo ./mcdc-linux-collect.sh
To run without root access:
./mcdc-linux-collect.sh
The script outputs a tar file named
mcdc-collect- MACHINE_NAME - TIMESTAMP .tar to the current directory. The timestamp is in the format YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm .
Click to see the guest collection tar file format
The tar file has the following format:
collect.log # Log output of the script
files # Directory containing files with their full path from root. For example:
|- etc/fstab
|- etc/hostname
|- etc/network/interfaces
|- ...
commands # Output of commands run by the script:
|- dpkg
|- netstat
|- ps
|- ...
found_paths # Text file with the list of installation directories
machinename # Text file with machine name
ostype # Text file with operating system type (Linux)
timestamp # Text file with collection timestamp
version # Text file with the version of the script
Optionally, you can pass the argument --output and specify the path
where you want to save the tar file.
Copy the collected data from the target machine to the host machine.
Import the collected data on the host machine:
Linux
./mcdc discover import PATH_TO_TAR
Windows
mcdc.exe discover import PATH_TO_TAR
Replace PATH_TO_TAR with the path to the tar file.
You can export and assess this collected data online in Migration Center,
or run an offline assessment.
Collect data remotely over WMI
If you want to perform a guest discovery on a target Windows machine with WMI
support, you can use the mcdc discover wmi command on the Windows machine that's
hosting the mcdc CLI. WMI collection is supported
only on the Windows version of the mcdc CLI.
By default, the mcdc CLI collects data by using remote WMI calls,
which is faster than script-based collection. However, remote WMI calls
aren't supported on Windows Server 2008 and earlier versions.
If you need to collect data from earlier Windows versions, or if you
encounter issues when using WMI remote calls, you can use script-based
collection instead by adding the --script flag.
When using WMI, the mcdc CLI does the following:
Uploads the collection script to the machine.
Runs the script on the machine with the machine user credentials passed
to the mcdc CLI.
Note: While the machine user credentials don't require administrator access,
having administrator access lets the mcdc CLI
collect all the assessment data. For information about configuring WMI for
remote access by non-administrator accounts, see
Set up remote WMI connection
and Securing a Remote WMI Connection .
Downloads and imports the results to Migration Center.
To collect data over WMI, follow these steps:
Sign in to the Windows machine that's hosting the mcdc CLI.
Change to the directory where you downloaded the
mcdc CLI.
Collect data using one of the following methods:
To collect data with remote WMI calls, run the following command:
mcdc.exe discover wmi IP_HOSTNAME
Replace IP_HOSTNAME with the IP hostname of
the machine.
To collect data by using script-based collection, use the --script flag:
mcdc.exe discover wmi --script IP_HOSTNAME
Enter your credentials when prompted.
You can export and assess this collected data online in Migration Center,
or run an offline assessment.
Collect data on an individual Windows machine
To perform a guest collection locally on a Windows machine, you can run the
mcdc-windows-collect.ps1 script.
Then, you can copy the zip file generated by the script into the machine that
hosts the mcdc CLI, and import it with the
discover import command.
Sign in to your machine.
Open PowerShell using the Run as Administrator option.
Change to the directory where you downloaded the mcdc CLI.
Run the collection script on the machine:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File .\mcdc-windows-collect.ps1
The script outputs a zip file named
mcdc-collect- MACHINE_NAME - TIMESTAMP .zip
to the current directory.
Optionally, you can include an output path to specify a different location:
.\mcdc-windows-collect.ps1 PATH_FOR_OUTPUT .zip
Import the collected data on the host machine:
Linux
./mcdc discover import PATH_TO_TAR
Windows
mcdc.exe discover import PATH_TO_TAR
Replace PATH_TO_TAR with the path to the tar file.
You can export the collected data and assess it online in
Migration Center, or run an offline assessment.
