RestoreDefault
Defines a Cloud Organization Policy which is used to specify Constraints for configurations of Cloud Platform resources.
JSON representation
{
"version" : integer ,
"constraint" : string ,
"etag" : string ,
"updateTime" : string ,
// Union field policy_type can be only one of the following:
"listPolicy" : {

object ( RestoreDefault )
}
// End of list of possible types for union field policy_type .
}
Fields
version
integer
Version of the Policy . Default version is 0;
constraint
string
The name of the Constraint the Policy is configuring, for example, constraints/serviceuser.services .
A list of available constraints is available.
Immutable after creation.
etag
string ( bytes format)
An opaque tag indicating the current version of the Policy , used for concurrency control.
When the Policy is returned from either a GetPolicy or a ListOrgPolicy request, this etag indicates the version of the current Policy to use when executing a read-modify-write loop.
When the Policy is returned from a GetEffectivePolicy request, the etag will be unset.
When the Policy is used in a projects.setOrgPolicy method, use the etag value that was returned from a projects.getOrgPolicy request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the etag in a projects.setOrgPolicy request will result in an unconditional write of the Policy .
A base64-encoded string.
updateTime
string ( Timestamp format)
The time stamp the Policy was previously updated. This is set by the server, not specified by the caller, and represents the last time a call to projects.setOrgPolicy was made for that Policy . Any value set by the client will be ignored.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
Union field policy_type . The field to populate is based on the constraint_type value in the Constraint . list_constraint => list_policy boolean_constraint => boolean_policy
A restore_default message may be used with any Constraint type.
Providing a *_policy that is incompatible with the constraint_type will result in an invalid_argument error.
Attempting to set a Policy with a policy_type not set will result in an invalid_argument error. policy_type can be only one of the following:
listPolicy
object ( ListPolicy )
List of values either allowed or disallowed.
booleanPolicy
object ( BooleanPolicy )
For boolean Constraints , whether to enforce the Constraint or not.
restoreDefault
object ( RestoreDefault )
Restores the default behavior of the constraint; independent of Constraint type.
ListPolicy
Used in policyType to specify how listPolicy behaves at this resource.
ListPolicy can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy ( Organizations , Folders , Projects ) that are allowed or denied by setting the allowedValues and deniedValues fields. This is achieved by using the under: and optional is: prefixes. The under: prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The is: prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a ":". Values prefixed with "is:" are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats:
"projects/ ", e.g. "projects/tokyo-rain-123"
"folders/ ", e.g. "folders/1234"
"organizations/ ", e.g. "organizations/1234"
The supportsUnder field of the associated Constraint defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set allowedValues and deniedValues in the same Policy if allValues is ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED . ALLOW or DENY are used to allow or deny all values. If allValues is set to either ALLOW or DENY , allowedValues and deniedValues must be unset.
JSON representation
{
"allowedValues" : [
string
] ,
"deniedValues" : [
string
] ,
"allValues" : enum ( AllValues ) ,
"suggestedValue" : string ,
"inheritFromParent" : boolean
}
Fields
allowedValues[]
string
List of values allowed at this resource. Can only be set if allValues is set to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED .
deniedValues[]
string
List of values denied at this resource. Can only be set if allValues is set to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED .
allValues
enum ( AllValues )
The policy allValues state.
suggestedValue
string
Optional. The Google Cloud Console will try to default to a configuration that matches the value specified in this Policy . If suggestedValue is not set, it will inherit the value specified higher in the hierarchy, unless inheritFromParent is false .
inheritFromParent
boolean
Determines the inheritance behavior for this Policy .
By default, a ListPolicy set at a resource supersedes any Policy set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if inheritFromParent is set to true , then the values from the effective Policy of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this Policy are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.
Setting Policy hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a Policy with allowedValues set that inherits a Policy with deniedValues set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in allowedValues and not present in deniedValues .
For example, suppose you have a Constraint constraints/serviceuser.services , which has a constraint_type of listConstraint , and with constraintDefault set to ALLOW . Suppose that at the Organization level, a Policy is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to { E1 , E2 }. Then, if a Policy is applied to a project below the Organization that has inheritFromParent set to false and field allValues set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.
The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for projects/bar parented by organizations/foo :
Example 1 (no inherited values): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues:"E2"} projects/bar has inheritFromParent false and values: {allowedValues: "E3" allowedValues: "E4"} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 . The accepted values at projects/bar are E3 , and E4 .
Example 2 (inherited values): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues:"E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with values: {value: "E3" value: "E4" inheritFromParent: true} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 . The accepted values at projects/bar are E1 , E2 , E3 , and E4 .
Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues: "E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with: {deniedValues: "E1"} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 . The value accepted at projects/bar is E2 .
Example 4 (RestoreDefault): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues:"E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 . The accepted values at projects/bar are either all or none depending on the value of constraintDefault (if ALLOW , all; if DENY , none).
Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): organizations/foo has no Policy set. projects/bar has no Policy set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of constraintDefault (if ALLOW , all; if DENY , none).
Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues: "E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 .
Any value is accepted at projects/bar`.
Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "E1" allowedValues: "E2"} projects/bar has a Policy with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at organizations/foo are E1 , E2 .
No value is accepted at projects/bar`.
Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1->{F1, F2}; F1->{P1}; F2->{P2, P3}, organizations/foo has a Policy with values: {allowedValues: "under:organizations/O1"} projects/bar has a Policy with: {allowedValues: "under:projects/P3"} {deniedValues: "under:folders/F2"} The accepted values at organizations/foo are organizations/O1 , folders/F1 , folders/F2 , projects/P1 , projects/P2 , projects/P3 . The accepted values at projects/bar are organizations/O1 , folders/F1 , projects/P1 .
AllValues
This enum can be used to set Policies that apply to all possible configuration values rather than specific values in allowedValues or deniedValues .
Setting this to ALLOW will mean this Policy allows all values. Similarly, setting it to DENY will mean no values are allowed. If set to either ALLOW or DENY, allowedValues and deniedValues
must be unset. Setting this to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED allows for
setting allowedValues and deniedValues`.
Enums
ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED
Indicates that allowedValues or deniedValues must be set.
ALLOW
A policy with this set allows all values.
DENY
A policy with this set denies all values.
BooleanPolicy
Used in policyType to specify how booleanPolicy will behave at this resource.
JSON representation
{
"enforced" : boolean
}
Fields
enforced
boolean
If true , then the Policy is enforced. If false , then any configuration is acceptable.
Suppose you have a Constraint constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess with constraintDefault set to ALLOW . A Policy for that Constraint exhibits the following behavior: - If the Policy at this resource has enforced set to false , serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the Policy at this resource has enforced set to true , serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the Policy at this resource is RestoreDefault , serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no Policy is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no Policy is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the Policy were set at this resource.
The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings:
Example 1 (nearest Constraint wins): organizations/foo has a Policy with: {enforced: false} projects/bar has no Policy set. The constraint at projects/bar and organizations/foo will not be enforced.
Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): organizations/foo has a Policy with: {enforced: false} projects/bar has a Policy with: {enforced: true} The constraint at organizations/foo is not enforced. The constraint at projects/bar is enforced.
Example 3 (RestoreDefault): organizations/foo has a Policy with: {enforced: true} projects/bar has a Policy with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at organizations/foo is enforced. The constraint at projects/bar is not enforced, because constraintDefault for the Constraint is ALLOW .
RestoreDefault
This type has no fields.
Ignores policies set above this resource and restores the constraintDefault enforcement behavior of the specific Constraint at this resource.
Suppose that constraintDefault is set to ALLOW for the Constraint constraints/serviceuser.services . Suppose that organization foo.com sets a Policy at their Organization resource node that restricts the allowed service activations to deny all service activations. They could then set a Policy with the policyType restoreDefault on several experimental projects, restoring the constraintDefault enforcement of the Constraint for only those projects, allowing those projects to have all services activated.
