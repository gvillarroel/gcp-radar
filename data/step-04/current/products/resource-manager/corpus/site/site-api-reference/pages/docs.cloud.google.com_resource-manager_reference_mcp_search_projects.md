Tool: search_projects
Searches for Google Cloud projects. This tool may be used whenever any tools or conversation context requires a GCP project. A SearchProjects call with an empty query will return all projects the user has access to, which can be used to determine a curated list of projects. The tool can find projects by parent (e.g., 'parent:folders/223'), project ID (e.g., 'projectId:my-project-id'), or other filters.
The following sample demonstrate how to use curl to invoke the search_projects MCP tool.
Curl Request
curl --location 'https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/mcp' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
--data '{
"method": "tools/call",
"params": {
"name": "search_projects",
"arguments": {
// provide these details according to the tool' s MCP specification
}
} ,
"jsonrpc" : "2.0" ,
"id" : 1
} '
Input Schema
The request sent to the SearchProjects method.
SearchProjectsRequest
JSON representation
{
"query" : string ,
"pageToken" : string ,
"pageSize" : integer
}
Fields
query
string
Optional. A query string for searching for projects that the caller has resourcemanager.projects.get permission to. If multiple fields are included in the query, then it will return results that match any of the fields. Some eligible fields are:
| Field | Description |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| displayName, name | Filters by displayName. |
| parent | Project's parent (for example: folders/123, organizations/*). Prefer parent field over parent.type and parent.id.|
| parent.type | Parent's type: `folder` or `organization`. |
| parent.id | Parent's id number (for example: 123) |
| id, projectId | Filters by projectId. |
| state, lifecycleState | Filters by state. |
| labels | Filters by label name or value. |
| labels.\<key\> (where *key* is the name of a label) | Filters by label name.|
Search expressions are case insensitive.
Some examples queries:
| Query | Description |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| name:how* | The project's name starts with "how". |
| name:Howl | The project's name is `Howl` or `howl`. |
| name:HOWL | Equivalent to above. |
| NAME:howl | Equivalent to above. |
| labels.color:* | The project has the label `color`. |
| labels.color:red | The project's label `color` has the value `red`. |
| labels.color:red labels.size:big | The project's label `color` has the
value `red` or its label `size` has the value `big`. |
If no query is specified, the call will return projects for which the user has the resourcemanager.projects.get permission.
pageToken
string
Optional. A pagination token returned from a previous call to ListProjects that indicates from where listing should continue.
pageSize
integer
Optional. The maximum number of projects to return in the response. The server can return fewer projects than requested. If unspecified, server picks an appropriate default.
Output Schema
A page of the response received from the SearchProjects method.
A paginated response where more pages are available has next_page_token set. This token can be used in a subsequent request to retrieve the next request page.
SearchProjectsResponse
JSON representation
{
"projects" : [
{
object ( Project )
}
] ,
"nextPageToken" : string
}
Fields
projects[]
object ( Project )
The list of Projects that matched the list filter query. This list can be paginated.
nextPageToken
string
Pagination token.
If the result set is too large to fit in a single response, this token is returned. It encodes the position of the current result cursor. Feeding this value into a new list request with the page_token parameter gives the next page of the results.
When next_page_token is not filled in, there is no next page and the list returned is the last page in the result set.
Pagination tokens have a limited lifetime.
