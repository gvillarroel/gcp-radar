List all projects and folders in your hierarchy
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Resources in Google Cloud are organized into a
hierarchy , with each node (Organizations,
Folders, Projects, and so forth) having a reference to its parent. You can use
that reference as a key filter term for scans to improve the consistency of
resource searches.
You can grant users permissions using
custom roles . These roles operate on the
principle of least privilege, and generally provide only the minimum necessary
permissions required to do a particular task.
This scheme can be useful for isolating different user groups. For example:
A large company with departments that shouldn't be able to inspect the
resources of their peers.
Contractors who are given permissions to a specific Project, but no other
resources.
As a result of their restricted permissions, however, custom roles may cause
many resources in your hierarchy to be omitted when executing a list operation.
When performing searches as a user that has been granted a custom role, it can
be difficult to tell why certain resources are not appearing.
To avoid this scenario, this page discusses the best practices for listing all
of the resources managed by the Cloud Resource Manager API in your resource hierarchy. You
can use this guidance to configure custom audit checks, or to create your own
user experience on top of the Cloud Resource Manager API.
List all resource nodes
When you scan your resource hierarchy to list every resource, you need strongly
consistent results. If your scan misses resources or provides outdated results,
it can be hard to tell that something has gone wrong. To make sure that you
always get the most accurate and complete results, use a service account and
perform a scan in the following way:
Grant a service account the list and get permissions for Organizations,
Folders, and Projects on the Organization resource.
If you are listing Project and Folder resources, specify the parent resource
in the filter string.
Run the
projects.list() method
with this service account for each type of resource you want to find, and
for any intermediate resources such as Folders.
Example to list all resource nodes
The following pseudocode demonstrates how to list every resource node in your
Organizations:
organizations = organizations.search()
projects = emptyList()
parentsToList = queueOf(organizations)
while (parent = parentsToList.pop()) {
// TODO: Iterate over paginated results as needed.
// TODO: Handle PERMISSION_DENIED appropriately.
projects.addAll(projects.list(parent.type, parent.id))
parentsToList.addAll(folders.list(parent))
}
When building a custom user experience, you may also want to mix in search
results and load the parent resources as needed (while also catching the
PERMISSION_DENIED exception).
Reduce latency on gcloud projects list
If your gcloud projects list query fails or takes too long, the number of
Google Cloud projects to return might be too large. To fix this, apply the
filter and page-size flags to your gcloud projects list command.
To learn more about the flags you can add to your gcloud projects list command,
see gcloud projects list .
Exclude Apps Script projects example
The most common cause of query failures or latency is a high number of Apps
Script projects within an organization. The following command shows how to exclude
Apps Script projects from the projects list and limit the number of resources
returned per page.
gcloud projects list --filter="NOT parent.id: 'APPS_SCRIPT_FOLDER_ID' "--page-size='30'
Get the Apps Script folder ID
To find your Apps Script folder ID, take the following steps.
In the toolbar of the Google Cloud console, click
Search for resources, docs, products, and more and type apps-script .
Go to Google Cloud console
Under Resources select the apps-script folder.
Under Folder ID copy the folder ID.
Search resources
If your scan is intended to search for a resource that was created some time
ago, you can perform a faster scan that has eventual consistency rather than
strong consistency. Note that this search method may omit some resources from
the search result, particularly any resources that have been changed recently.
To search for resources:
Use a service account that has the get permission for the resource you are
searching for.
Run the
projects.search()
method with this service account.
Troubleshooting omitted resources
If you are developing a scanning tool, we recommend that you use list and
get permissions granted at the Organization level. This avoids issues caused
by the user having partial permissions, which results in some resources being
omitted from the list.
If you are designing a custom user experience that checks user permissions,
there is no straightforward solution. If a user does not have Organization-level
permissions, they will need certain permissions on every resource for it to
appear. If a user is missing permissions on a resource somewhere in the
hierarchy, some resources may not appear.
If a user has the list permission but not the get permission for a
particular resource, that resource won't be visible at all in the
Google Cloud console. However, the resource will be returned in a search using the
API or Google Cloud CLI that specifies the resource's parent. This disparity
between the Google Cloud console and other methods is a common source of confusion
when trying to scan the resource hierarchy.
The following diagrams demonstrate some common configurations of permissions,
and how they change what resources are visible to a user running a search.
In this example, all required permissions are granted in the Organization
resource. Therefore, the entire hierarchy is visible when performing a list or
search.
The user in this example has all required permissions except for
resourcemanager.organizations.get , but they are granted those permissions at
the Folder level. This permissions gap gives them full visibility on list or
search of that part of the hierarchy, but not the other half.
This example shows the experience of a user with only the
resourcemanager.projects.get permission granted at the Folder resource level.
They are able to see the Projects underneath that Folder in the hierarchy, but
only by searching. Using the list functionality won't return any results.
This example illustrates a similar scenario where the granted permissions only
let you find your Folder resources by searching. The list operation does not
return any results.
The user in this example has a mix of permissions throughout their Organization.
They can list folders from the Organization level, which allows them to find
them with searches that specify the parent resource throughout the hierarchy.
They can list Project resources for one Folder, but not the other, and they have
resourcemanager.projects.get permission on one Project at the bottom of the
hierarchy.
The result is that they aren't able to return the Projects on the left side of
this resource hierarchy. They can list the Projects on the right side only by
using a search that specifies the parent resource, and only one Project is
visible when viewed in the Google Cloud console.
In this example, you can get the Organization resource and list Project
resources by specifying the parent throughout the hierarchy. However, you don't
have permission to list or search any intermediate Folders. Your Projects are
searchable if you know the ID of their parent Folder. The Folders are not
visible to you, so you can't discover the ID if you don't already have it. The
only resource that appears in the Google Cloud console is the Organization.
When designing your custom user experience, it's important to be aware of
situations similar to these situations. You can use a combination of listing and
searching to render the resource hierarchy. You should also consider how to
communicate to users that they are missing permissions that would allow them to
see the whole resource hierarchy.
