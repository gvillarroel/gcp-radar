Access control for organization resources with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud offers Identity and Access Management (IAM) , which
lets you give more granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and
prevents unwanted access to other resources. IAM lets you adopt
the
security principle of least privilege ,
so you grant only the necessary access to your resources.
IAM lets you control who (users) has what access (roles)
to which resources by setting allow policies. Allow policies grant specific
roles to a user to give the user certain permissions.
This page explains the IAM roles that are available on the
organization resource, and how to create and manage allow policies for
organization resources using the Cloud Resource Manager API. For more information, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Note: You can also use deny policies to prevent principals from using specific
IAM permissions. For more information, see Deny
policies .
Permissions and roles
To control access to resources, Google Cloud requires that accounts making API
requests have appropriate IAM roles. IAM roles
include permissions that let users perform specific actions on
Google Cloud resources. For example, the
resourcemanager.organizations.get permission allows a user to get details
about their organization resource.
You don't directly give users permissions; instead, you grant them
roles , which have one or more permissions bundled within them.
You can grant one or more roles on the same resource.
Use predefined roles
The following table lists the roles that you can grant to access an
organization resource's properties, the description of what the role does, and the
permissions bundled within that role.
Note: In addition to the roles listed in the following table, other Google Cloud
services offer IAM roles that you can set at the organization resource level. For a list
of all roles you can grant at the organization level, see
Understanding Roles .

Creating custom roles
In addition to the predefined roles described in this topic, you can also create
custom roles that are collections of
permissions that you tailor to your needs. When creating a custom role for use
with Resource Manager, be aware of the following points:
List and get permissions, such as resourcemanager.projects.get/list ,
should always be granted as a pair.
When your custom role includes the folders.list and folders.get
permissions, it should also include projects.list and projects.get .
Be aware that the setIamPolicy permission for organization, folder, and
project resources allows the user to grant all other permissions, and so should be assigned with care.
View existing access for an organization resource
You can view what roles a user is granted for an organization resource by
getting that resource's allow policy. You can view the allow policy for an
organization resource using the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI,
or the getIamPolicy()
method.
Console
To view granted roles at the organization resource level using the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Manage resources page in the Google Cloud console:
Open the Manage resources
page
On the Organization drop-down menu, select your organization resource.
Select the checkbox for the organization resource.
In the Info Panel , under Permissions , click Expand
a role and display all members who have that role.
gcloud
Get the allow policy for the organization resource using the
get-iam-policy command:
gcloud alpha organizations get-iam-policy <var>ORGANIZATION_ID</var> --format json >
<var>FILENAME.JSON</var>
The command outputs the allow policy, which looks similar to the following:
bindings :
- members :
- user:testuser1@gcp-test.com
role : roles/editor
- members :
- user:admin@gcp-test.com
role:roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin
- members :
- user:testuser2@gcp-test.com
role : roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
etag" : "BwU1aRxWk30="
API
The following code snippet returns the allow policy for the organization
resource
https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/organizations/12345 .
Request:
POST
https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/organizations/12345:getIamPolicy
Response:
{
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin" ,
"members" : [
"user:email1@gmail.com"
]
},
{
"role" : "roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator" ,
"members" : [
"user:email2@gmail.com" ,
"user:email3@gmail.com" ,
"serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
]
}
]
"etag" : "BwUjHYKHHiQ="
}
Python
The method
getIamPolicy()
lets you get an allow policy that was previously set.
crm = discovery . build (
'cloudresourcemanager' , 'v3' , http = creds . authorize ( httplib2 . Http ()))
policy = crm . organizations () . getIamPolicy (
resource = flags . organizationId , body = {}) . execute ()
print json . dumps ( policy , indent = 2 )
Grant access to an organization resource
Organization Administrators can grant IAM roles to team members
so that they can access an organization's resources and APIs. You can grant
roles to a user account email, a Google Group, a service account, or a G Suite
domain. You can use the Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI, or
the
setIamPolicy()
method to grant roles.
Note: If you're getting started with Google Cloud, you can grant the
appropriate IAM roles to your organization administrator groups
as part of the Google Cloud set up process .
Console
To set access control at the organization resource level using the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Manage resources page in the Google Cloud console:
Open the Manage resources
page
On the Organization drop-down menu, select your organization resource.
Select the checkbox for the organization resource. If you don't have a
folder resource, the organization resource is not visible. To
continue, see the instructions for granting roles through the
IAM
page.
If the Info Panel on the right is hidden, click Show Info
Panel in the top right corner.
In the Info Panel , in the Permissions tab, click
Add Member .
In the New members field, enter the team members you want to add.
You can specify a user account email, a Google Group, a service
account, or a G Suite domain.
In the Select a role drop-down menu, select the role you want to
grant to the team members.
Click Add .
gcloud
To set an organization resource's allow policy using the gcloud command:
Get the allow policy for the organization resource using the
get-iam-policy command and output the policy to a JSON file:
gcloud alpha organizations get-iam-policy <var>ORGANIZATION_ID</var>
--format json > <var>FILENAME.JSON</var>
The contents of the JSON file looks similar to the
following:
{
"bindings" : [
{
"members" : [
"user:testuser1@gcp-test.com"
],
"role" : "roles/editor"
},
{
"members" : [
"user:admin@gcp-test.com" ,
],
"role" : "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin"
},
{
"members" : [
"user:testuser2@gcp-test.com"
],
"role" : "roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator"
},
],
"etag" : "BwU1aRxWk30="
}
Open the JSON file in a text editor. Then, add a new entry to the bindings array to define an Organization Administrator. For example, to make
anotheradmin@gcp-test.com an Organization Administrator, change
the previous example as follows:
{
"bindings" : [
{
"members" : [
"user:testuser1@gcp-test.com"
],
"role" : "roles/editor"
},
{
"members" : [
"user:admin@gcp-test.com" ,
"user:anotheradmin@gcp-test.com"
],
"role" : "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin"
},
{
"members" : [
"user:testuser20@gcp-test.com"
],
"role" : "roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator"
},
],
"etag" : "BwU1aRxWk30="
}
Update the organization resource's allow policy by running the following
command:
gcloud alpha organizations set-iam-policy <var>ORGANIZATION_ID</var> policy.json
API
Request:
POST h tt ps : //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/organizations/12345:setIamPolicy
{

"user:email3@gmail.com" ,
"serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
]
}
]
"etag" : "BwUjHYKHHiQ="
}
}
Response:
{
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin" ,

The setIamPolicy() method lets you grant roles to users by attaching an
allow policy to the organization resource. The allow policy is a collection
of bindings that define .
Read-Modify-Write : A common pattern for updating a resource's metadata,
such as the allow policy, involves reading its current state, updating the data
locally, and then sending the modified data for writing. This pattern can
result in a conflict if two or more independent processes attempt the
sequence simultaneously. For example, if two project owners attempt to make conflicting changes to the allow
policy simultaneously, one owner's changes might fail. IAM solves this problem by using an etag
property in allow policies. This property verifies whether the
allow policy has changed since the last request. When you make a request
with an etag value, the system compares the etag value in the request with the
existing etag value associated with the policy. It writes the allow policy
only if the etag values match.
When you update an allow policy, first get the allow policy using
getIamPolicy() , update the allow policy, and then write the updated allow
policy using setIamPolicy() . When you set the allow policy, use the etag value only if the corresponding allow policy in GetPolicyResponse
contains an etag value.
Python
The
setIamPolicy()
method lets you attach an allow policy to a resource. The setIamPolicy
method takes a SetIamPolicyRequest , which contains an allow policy to be
set and the resource to which the allow policy is attached. It returns the
resulting allow policy. We recommend following the
read-modify-write pattern
when you update an allow policy using setIamPolicy() .
Here is some sample code to set an allow policy for an organization
resource:
crm = discovery . build (
'cloudresourcemanager' , 'v3' , http = creds . authorize ( httplib2 . Http ()))
policy = crm . organizations () . getIamPolicy (
resource = flags . organizationId , body = {}) . execute ()
admin_binding = next (
( binding
for binding in policy [ 'bindings' ]
if binding [ 'role' ] == 'roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin' ),
None )
# Add an empty Organization Administrator binding if not present.
if not admin_binding :
admin_binding = {
'role' : 'roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin' ,
'members' : []
}
policy [ 'bindings' ] . append ( admin_binding )
# Add the new Admin (if necessary).
new_admin = 'user:' + flags . adminEmail
if new_admin not in admin_binding [ 'members' ]:
admin_binding [ 'members' ] . append ( new_admin )
policy = crm . organizations () . setIamPolicy (
resource = flags . organizationId ,
body = {
'resource' : flags . organizationId ,
'policy' : policy
}) . execute ()
print json . dumps ( policy , indent = 2 )
Restrict project visibility for users
Users can see all projects they have access to in the Google Cloud console and
in search queries, regardless of whether or not they are in the user's selected
organization resource. You can use the Organization Policy Service to restrict the set of
projects that are returned in queries and in the Google Cloud console. This
lets you restrict users to see projects only within your domain.
The Organization Policy constraint
constraints/resourcemanager.accessBoundaries is a
list constraint
that is enforced on your organization resource. The constraint accepts a list of
organization resource IDs, which define the set of organization resources that
make their resources visible to users in a query or the Google Cloud console.
Projects appear under No organization if the user does not have the
resourcemanager.organizations.get permission on the parent organization
resource of the project. This can make a project that is not part
of your organization resource appear to be unassociated with any organization resource.
If you use the resourcemanager.accessBoundaries constraint to disallow an
organization resource, projects that belong to that organization resource don't
appear in queries or in the Google Cloud console. Projects not yet migrated to an organization resource are not visible if you enforce this constraint.
We recommend migrating projects that are under No organization to your
organization resource before enforcing this constraint. For information about
moving projects into an organization resource, see
Moving a project .
For information about setting an organization policy, see
Using constraints .
Grant conditional access
Certain IAM roles, such as Organization Policy Administrator
( roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin ) can only be granted on an organization resource.
Due to policy inheritance , all resources in the organization normally inherit this role.
For more control over which resources the role is granted on, you can use
IAM Conditions . Using tags with
conditions lets you grant access to resources only if they have the specified
tag . For example, the following allow
policy grants the Organization Policy Administrator role only on resources that
have the environment: dev tag, and doesn't grant it on any other resource:
{
"bindings" : [
{
"members" : [
"{dynamic print variables.examples.principal_group_api}"
],
"role" : "roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin" ,
"condition" : {
"title" : "Dev_environment_only" ,
"description" : "Only granted in the development environment" ,
"expression" :
"resource.matchTag('123456789012/env', 'dev')"
}
}
],
"etag" : "BwWKmjvelug=" ,
"version" : 3
}
Test permissions
You can test IAM permissions on a user for an organization
resource with the
testIamPermissions()
method. This method takes the resource URL and the set of permissions to test. It returns the subset of these permissions that
the user can access.
You typically don't invoke testIamPermissions() if you're using the
Google Cloud console directly to manage permissions. testIamPermissions() is
intended for integration with your proprietary software such as a customized
graphical user interface. For example, the Google Cloud console uses
testIamPermissions() internally to determine which UI is available to
the logged-in user.
API
You can use the
testIamPermissions()
method to check which of the given permissions the caller has for the given
resource. This method takes a resource name and a set of permissions as
parameters, and returns the subset of permissions that the caller has.
Here is some sample code to test permissions for an organization resource:
Reques t :
POST h tt ps : //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/organizations/12345:testIamPermissions
{
"permissions" : [
"resourcemanager.organizations.get" ,
"resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy"
]
}
Respo nse :
{
"permissions" : [
"resourcemanager.organizations.get"
]
}
Python
crm = discovery . build (
'cloudresourcemanager' , 'v3' , http = creds . authorize ( httplib2 . Http ()))
response = crm . organizations () . testIamPermissions (
resource = flags . organizationId ,
body = {
'resource' : flags . organizationId ,
'permissions' : [
'resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy' ,
'resourcemanager.projects.patch'
]
}) . execute ()
print json . dumps ( response , indent = 2 )
