Manage projects within folders
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to organize your Google Cloud hierarchy by nesting projects
within folders.
Overview
In the Google Cloud resource hierarchy, projects serve as the core organizational
and billing units for your resources. They sit between folders (or the organization resource)
and the underlying resources, such as virtual machine instances and storage buckets.
While folders are an optional grouping mechanism, organizing your projects
within folders provides several key advantages:
Scalable governance: Automatically apply Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and
security constraints to multiple projects through hierarchy-based inheritance.
Business alignment: Structure your cloud environment to reflect your organization's
departments, cost centers, or development lifecycles (such as Dev, Staging, and Prod).
Delegated administration: Grant specific teams the autonomy to manage their own
projects and sub-folders without requiring broad permissions at the organization level.
Cost visibility: Group related projects to simplify spend tracking and enhance
billing analysis for specific business units or applications.
Security isolation: Establish clear trust boundaries to limit the affected area
of configuration changes and reduce security risks across different environments.
Create a project in a folder
To create a project in a folder, you must have the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ) on the folder. This role may be
inherited from a parent folder.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the Manage resources page.
Open Google Cloud console
Go to the Manage resources page.
Select your organization resource from the Organization drop-down on the top
left of the page.
Click Create Project .
Enter a Project name .
In the Destination box, click Browse to select the folder under
which you want to create the project.
Click Create .
gcloud
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID --folder FOLDER_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project ID to create
FOLDER_ID : the ID of the folder in which the project should be
created.
REST
The request JSON:
request_json= '{
name: DISPLAY_NAME , projectId: PROJECT_ID , parent: {id: PARENT_ID , type: PARENT_TYPE }
}'
The curl request:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${bearer_token}" \
-d "$request_json" \
https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/projects
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the unique identifier of the project being created. For example, my-awesome-proj-123 .
DISPLAY_NAME : the display name of the project being created.
PARENT_ID : the unique identifier of the parent being created under. For example, 123 .
PARENT_TYPE : the type of the parent, like folder or organization .
Don't include sensitive information in your folder name or other resource names.
Any reference to the folder or related resources exposes the folder name and
resource name.
Move a project into a folder
You must carefully consider any policy implications before you move a project
into or out of a folder. Allow policies that you define at the project level
will move with the project, but policies inherited from a parent resource won't
move.
Note: The following instructions are only for moving a project within an
organization resource. For information about migrating a project between organization resources,
see Migrating projects .
When you move a project, any Identity and Access Management policies or organization policies that
are directly attached will move with it. However, a project in your resource
hierarchy is also affected by the policies that it inherits from parent
resources. If a project inherits an IAM role that provides users
permission to use a particular service, users won't have access to that
service at the destination unless it would inherit the permission at the
destination as well.
For example, consider a service account has the Storage Object Creator
role bound to a user at Folder A. The service account has permissions to upload
data to Cloud Storage in any project in Folder A. If you moved one of these
projects to Folder B, which does not have the same inherited permissions, the
service account for that project loses the ability to upload data, resulting in
a service outage.
These same considerations apply if organization policies are defined at the
source and destination folders. Like IAM policies, organization
policies are inherited. Consequently, you must ensure that your organization
policies are consistent between source and destination folders.
To learn more about organization policies, see
Introduction to the organization Policy Service .
To move a project, you need the Project Mover IAM role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectMover ) on both the source folder and the
destination folder. If the resource is not in a folder, you need this role on
the organization resource.
These roles give you the following required permissions:
resourcemanager.projects.update on the project
If the resource is in a folder: resourcemanager.projects.move on the
source folder and the destination
If the resource is not in a folder: resourcemanager.projects.move on the
organization resource
You can also gain these permissions with custom
roles , or other predefined roles.
Console
To move a project:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
Select your Organization from the Organization drop-down on the top
left of the page.
Click the project's row to select your project from the list of
resources. Note that you must not click the name of the
project, which takes you to the project's Identity and Access Management (IAM) page.
Click the options menu (the vertical ellipsis) in the row and click
Move .
Click Browse to select the folder to which you want to move the
project.
Click Move .
gcloud
To move a project, run the
gcloud beta projects move
command:
gcloud beta projects move PROJECT_ID \
-- DESTINATION_TYPE DESTINATION_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The ID or number of the project you want to move.
DESTINATION_TYPE : The type of the destination, either organization or folder .
DESTINATION_ID : The ID of the organization resource or folder where you want to move the project.
REST
You can use the v3
projects.move method
to move a project.
Request:
POST https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/{name= PROJECT_NAME }:move
{
"destinationParent": DESTINATION_PARENT
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_NAME : the name of the project you want
to update. For example, projects/415104041262
DESTINATION_PARENT : the new parent organization resource
or folder under which you want to move the project. For example:
organizations/12345678901
If successful, the request will return an
Operation which
can be used to track the project move.
Move a folder into another folder
To move a folder into another folder, you must have the
resourcemanager.folders.move permission for both the source and destination
folders.
Console
The process of moving folders into other folders in the console is similar
to moving projects.
In the Google Cloud console, open the Manage resources page.
Open Google Cloud console
Select your organization resource from the Organization drop-down on the top
left of the page.
Click your folder's row to select your folder from the list of
projects and folders.
Click the options menu (the vertical ellipsis) in the row and click
Move .
Click Browse to select the folder to which you want to move the
folder.
Click Move .
gcloud
To move a folder under the organization resource, run the following command:
gcloud resource-manager folders move FOLDER_ID \
--organization= PARENT_ID
Replace the following:
FOLDER_ID : the ID of the folder to move
PARENT_ID : the ID of the parent organization resource
To move a folder under another folder, run the following command:
gcloud resource-manager folders move FOLDER_ID \
--folder= PARENT_ID
Replace the following:
FOLDER_ID : the ID of the folder to move
PARENT_ID : the ID of the parent folder
REST
The request JSON:
request_json= '{
destinationParent: "folders/ DESTINATION_FOLDER_ID "
}'
The Move Folder curl request:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${bearer_token} \
-d "$request_json" \
https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/folders/ DISPLAY_NAME :move
Replace the following:
DESTINATION_FOLDER_ID : the ID of the folder under which you're
moving another folder, for example 98765 .
DISPLAY_NAME : the display name of the folder being moved, for example
"My Awesome Folder."
The Move Folder response:
{
"name": "operations/fm.1234567890",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.resourcemanager.v3.FolderOperation",
"displayName": " DISPLAY_NAME ",
"operationType": "MOVE"
}
}
The Get Operation curl request:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${bearer_token}" \
https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/operations/fm.1234567890
The Get Operation response:
{
"name": "operations/fm.1234567890",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.resourcemanager.v3.FolderOperation",
"displayName": " DISPLAY_NAME ",
"operationType": "MOVE"
},
"done": true,
"response": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.resourcemanager.v3.Folder",
"name": "folders/12345",
"parent": "folders/98765",
"displayName": " DISPLAY_NAME ",
"lifecycleState": "ACTIVE",
"createTime": "2017-07-19T23:29:26.018Z",
"updateTime": "2017-07-20T00:54:44.295Z"
}
}
View or list projects within a folder
To view or list projects that are direct children of a folder, you must have the
Folder Viewer role ( roles/resourcemanager.folderViewer ) or the Browser role ( roles/browser )
on the folder.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the Manage resources page.
Open Manage resources page
In the Organization drop-down, select your organization.
In the resource list, click the name of the folder to expand it and view its projects.
Optional: Use the Filter bar at the top of the list to search for a specific project by name or ID.
gcloud
To list all projects that are direct children of a specific folder, use the
gcloud projects list command with a filter:
gcloud projects list --filter = "parent.id: FOLDER_ID AND parent.type:folder"
Replace FOLDER_ID with the unique ID of the folder.
REST
Use the projects.list method with a query parameter defining the parent folder.
HTTP request: GET https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/projects?parent=folders/ FOLDER_ID
Example curl command:
Bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
"https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/projects?parent=folders/ FOLDER_ID "
Replace FOLDER_ID with the unique ID of the folder.
Filter projects by Tags or Labels (Optional)
If you have a large number of projects within a folder, you can use filters to
find specific resources based on metadata.
Console
In the Filter bar on the Manage resources page, type Labels:key=value
to narrow the list to projects with specific labels. Note that the console
provides limited support for visual filtering by Tags; use the Google Cloud CLI
for advanced Tag queries.
gcloud
To list projects within a folder that have a specific Tag value, use the --filter
flag with the tags attribute:
gcloud projects list \
--filter = "parent.id: FOLDER_ID AND tags. TAG_KEY_PARENT / TAG_KEY_SHORT_NAME : TAG_VALUE_SHORT_NAME "
Replace the following:
FOLDER_ID : the unique ID of the folder.
TAG_KEY_PARENT : the ID of the tag key's parent resource, such as an organization or project.
TAG_KEY_SHORT_NAME : the short name of the tag key.
TAG_VALUE_SHORT_NAME : the short name of the tag value.
To filter by Labels:
gcloud projects list \
--filter = "parent.id: FOLDER_ID AND labels. KEY = VALUE "
Replace the following:
FOLDER_ID : the unique ID of the folder.
KEY : the key of the label.
VALUE : the value of the label.
