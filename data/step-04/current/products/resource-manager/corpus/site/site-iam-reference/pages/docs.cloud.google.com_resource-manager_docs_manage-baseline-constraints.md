Manage Google Cloud security baseline constraints
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
If you are a new customer, Google Cloud automatically provisions an
organization resource for your domain in the following scenarios:
A user from your domain logs in for the first time.
A user creates a billing account that does not have an associated organization
resource.
This organization resource's default configuration, characterized by unrestricted
access, can make the infrastructure susceptible to security breaches. For
example, default service account key creation is a critical vulnerability
exposing systems to potential breaches.
Google Cloud security baseline addresses insecure security postures with a bundle of organization
policies that are enforced when an organization resource is created. For more
information, see
getting an organization resource .
Examples of these organization policies include disabling
service account key creation and disabling service account key upload.
When an existing user creates an organization, the security posture for the
new organization resource might be different from the existing organization
resources. Google Cloud security baseline constraints are enforced for all organizations
created on or after May 3, 2024. Some organizations created between February
2024 and April 2024 might also have these default policy enforcements set. To
view organization policies applied to your organization, see
Viewing organization policies .
Before you begin
For more information about what organization policies and constraints are and
how they work, see the
introduction to the Organization Policy Service .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to manage organization policies,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Organization policy administrator ( roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin )
IAM role on the organization.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to manage organization policies. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to manage organization policies:
orgpolicy.constraints.list
orgpolicy.policies.create
orgpolicy.policies.delete
orgpolicy.policies.list
orgpolicy.policies.update
orgpolicy.policy.get
orgpolicy.policy.set
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
You can delegate the administration of organization policies by adding
IAM Conditions to the Organization
policy administrator role binding. To control the resources where a principal can manage
organization policies, you can make the role binding conditional on a particular
tag . For more information, see
Using constraints .
Organization policies enforced on organization resources
The following table lists the organization policy constraints that are
automatically enforced when you create an organization resource.
Organization policy name
Organization policy constraint
Description
Impact of enforcement
Disable service account key creation
constraints/iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation
Prevent users from creating persistent keys for service accounts. For information about managing service account keys, see Provide alternatives to creating service account keys .
Reduces the risk of exposed service account credentials.
Disable service account key upload
constraints/iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload
Prevent the upload of external public keys to service accounts. For information about accessing resources without service account keys, see these best practices .
Reduces the risk of exposed service account credentials.
Prevent the Editor role from being granted to default service accounts
constraints/iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts
Prevent default service accounts from receiving the overly permissive IAM Editor role at creation.
The Editor role lets the service account create and delete resources for most Google Cloud services, which creates a vulnerability if the service account gets compromised.
Restrict identities by domain
constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains
Limit resource sharing to identities that belong to a particular organization resource or Google Workspace customer ID.
Leaving the organization resource open to access by actors with domains other
than the customer's own creates a vulnerability.
Restrict contacts by domain
constraints/essentialcontacts.managed.allowedContactDomains
Limit Essential Contacts to only allow managed user identities in selected domains to receive platform notifications.
A bad actor with a different domain might get added as Essential Contacts, leading to a compromised security posture.
Restrict protocol forwarding based on type of IP address
constraints/compute.managed.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes
Restrict the configuration of protocol forwarding for internal IP addresses only.
Protects target instances from exposure to external traffic.
Uniform bucket-level access
constraints/storage.uniformBucketLevelAccess
Prevent Cloud Storage buckets from using per-object ACL (a separate system from allow and deny policies) to provide access.
Enforces consistency for access management and auditing.
Note: For some organizations created after August 15, 2024, the constraints/compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes organization policy constraint might already be applied.
Manage enforcement of organization policies
You can manage the enforcement of organization policies in the following ways:
List organization policies
To check whether the Google Cloud security baseline constraints are enforced on your
organization, use the following command:
gcloud resource-manager org-policies list --organization = ORGANIZATION_ID
Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with the unique identifier of
your organization.
Disable organization policies
To disable or delete an organization policy, run the following command:
gcloud org-policies delete CONSTRAINT_NAME --organization = ORGANIZATION_ID
Replace the following:
CONSTRAINT_NAME : the name of the organization policy
constraint that you want to delete—for example,
iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains
ORGANIZATION_ID : the unique identifier of your
organization
