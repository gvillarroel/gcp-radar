Move a project

This guide explains how to move a project within your organization resource.
The project is the base-level organizing entity in a
Google Cloud organization resource. Projects are created
under organization resources, and can be placed under folders or the organization
resource itself, forming the
resource hierarchy . You can move project
resources within your resource hierarchy, but should consider the policy
implications of the move before you make it.
Note: The following instructions are only for moving a project within an
organization resource. For information about migrating a project between organization resources,
see Migrating projects .
When you move a project, any Identity and Access Management policies or organization policies that
are directly attached will move with it. However, a project in your resource
hierarchy is also affected by the policies that it inherits from parent
resources. If a project inherits an IAM role that provides users
permission to use a particular service, users won't have access to that
service at the destination unless it would inherit the permission at the
destination as well.
For example, consider a service account has the Storage Object Creator
role bound to a user at Folder A. The service account has permissions to upload
data to Cloud Storage in any project in Folder A. If you moved one of these
projects to Folder B, which does not have the same inherited permissions, the
service account for that project loses the ability to upload data, resulting in
a service outage.
These same considerations apply if organization policies are defined at the
source and destination folders. Like IAM policies, organization
policies are inherited. Consequently, you must ensure that your organization
policies are consistent between source and destination folders.
To learn more about organization policies, see
Introduction to the organization Policy Service .
To move a project, you need the Project Mover IAM role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectMover ) on both the source folder and the
destination folder. If the resource is not in a folder, you need this role on
the organization resource.
These roles give you the following required permissions:
resourcemanager.projects.update on the project
If the resource is in a folder: resourcemanager.projects.move on the
source folder and the destination
If the resource is not in a folder: resourcemanager.projects.move on the
organization resource
You can also gain these permissions with custom
roles , or other predefined roles.
Console
To move a project:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
Select your Organization from the Organization drop-down on the top
left of the page.
Click the project's row to select your project from the list of
resources. Note that you must not click the name of the
project, which takes you to the project's Identity and Access Management (IAM) page.
Click the options menu (the vertical ellipsis) in the row and click
Move .
Click Browse to select the folder to which you want to move the
project.
Click Move .
gcloud
To move a project, run the
gcloud beta projects move
command:
gcloud beta projects move PROJECT_ID \
-- DESTINATION_TYPE DESTINATION_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The ID or number of the project you want to move.
DESTINATION_TYPE : The type of the destination, either organization or folder .
DESTINATION_ID : The ID of the organization resource or folder where you want to move the project.
REST
You can use the v3
projects.move method
to move a project.
Request:
POST https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/{name= PROJECT_NAME }:move
{
"destinationParent": DESTINATION_PARENT
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_NAME : the name of the project you want
to update. For example, projects/415104041262
DESTINATION_PARENT : the new parent organization resource
or folder under which you want to move the project. For example:
organizations/12345678901
If successful, the request will return an
Operation which
can be used to track the project move.
