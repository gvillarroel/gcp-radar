Access control for projects with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud offers Identity and Access Management (IAM) , which lets
you give more granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and
prevents unwanted access to other resources. IAM lets you adopt
the
security principle of least privilege ,
so you grant only the necessary access to your resources.
IAM lets you control who (users) has what access (roles)
to which resources by setting allow policies. Allow policies grant specific
roles to a user giving the user certain permissions.
This page explains the IAM permissions and roles you can use to
manage access to projects. For more information, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Note: You can also use deny policies to prevent principals from using specific
IAM permissions. For more information, see Deny
policies .
Note: If you're getting started with Google Cloud, you can set up your resource
hierarchy and grant initial access as part of the
Google Cloud setup process .
Permissions and roles
To control access to resources, Google Cloud requires that accounts making API
requests have appropriate IAM roles. IAM roles
include permissions that let users perform specific actions on
Google Cloud resources. For example, the resourcemanager.projects.delete
permission lets a user delete a project.
You don't directly give users permissions; instead, you grant them roles ,
which have one or more permissions bundled within them. You grant these roles on
a particular resource, but they also apply to all of that resource's descendants
in the resource hierarchy .
Permissions
To manage projects, the caller must have a role that includes the following
permissions. The role is granted on the organization resource or folder that contains the
projects:
Method
Required permission(s)
resourcemanager.projects.create
resourcemanager.projects.create
resourcemanager.projects.delete
resourcemanager.projects.delete
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.get
Granting this permission will also grant access to get the name of the billing
account associated with the project through the Billing API method
billing.projects.getBillingInfo
.
resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy
resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy
resourcemanager.projects.list
resourcemanager.projects.list
resourcemanager.projects.search
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy
resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy
resourcemanager.projects.testIamPermissions
Does not require any permission.
resourcemanager.projects.undelete
resourcemanager.projects.undelete
resourcemanager.projects.patch
To update a project's metadata, requires
resourcemanager.projects.update permission. To update a project's
parent and move the project into an organization resource, requires
resourcemanager.projects.create permission on the
organization resource.
projects.move
projects.move
Using predefined roles
IAM predefined roles let you manage the permissions available to
users. For a full list of the roles that can be granted at the project level,
see Understanding Roles .
The following table lists the predefined roles you can use to grant access to a
project. Each role includes a description of its purpose and the permissions it
contains.
Role
Permissions
Project Creator
( roles/ resourcemanager.projectCreator )
Provides access to create new projects. Once a user creates a project,
they're automatically granted the owner role for that project.
Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:
Folder
resourcemanager. organizations. get
resourcemanager. projects. create
Project Deleter
( roles/ resourcemanager.projectDeleter )
Provides access to delete Google Cloud projects.
Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:
Project
resourcemanager. projects. delete
Project Mover
( roles/ resourcemanager.projectMover )
Provides access to update and move projects.
Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:
Project
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.move
resourcemanager. projects. update
Project IAM Admin
( roles/ resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin )
Provides permissions to administer allow policies on projects.
Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:
Project
iam.policybindings.*
iam.policybindings.get
iam.policybindings.list
resourcemanager. projects. createPolicyBinding
resourcemanager. projects. deletePolicyBinding
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager. projects. getIamPolicy
resourcemanager. projects. searchPolicyBindings
resourcemanager. projects. setIamPolicy
resourcemanager. projects. updatePolicyBinding
Browser
( roles/ browser )
Read access to browse the hierarchy for a project, including the folder, organization, and allow
policy. This role doesn't include permission to view resources in the project.
Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:
Project
resourcemanager.folders.get
resourcemanager.folders.list
resourcemanager. organizations. get
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager. projects. getIamPolicy
resourcemanager.projects.list
Basic roles
Use basic roles only when necessary. These roles are highly privileged and grant
extensive permissions across all Google Cloud services. For more
information about when to use basic roles, see Basic
roles .
Role
Description
Permissions
roles/owner
Full access to all resources.
All permissions for all resources.
roles/editor
Edit access to most resources.
Create and update access for most resources.
roles/viewer
Read access to most resources.
Get and list access for most resources.
Creating custom roles
In addition to the predefined roles described in this topic, you can also create
custom roles that are collections of
permissions that you tailor to your needs. When creating a custom role for use
with Resource Manager, be aware of the following points:
List and get permissions, such as resourcemanager.projects.get/list ,
should always be granted as a pair.
When your custom role includes the folders.list and folders.get
permissions, it should also include projects.list and projects.get .
Be aware that the setIamPolicy permission for organization, folder, and
project resources allows the user to grant all other permissions, and so should be assigned with care.
Access control at the project level
You can grant roles to users at the project level using the Google Cloud console ,
the Cloud Resource Manager API, and the Google Cloud CLI. For instructions, see
Granting, Changing, and Revoking Access .
Default roles
When you create a project, you receive the roles/owner role, which gives you
full control over the project. You can change this default role in an allow
policy.
VPC Service Controls
VPC Service Controls can provide additional security when using the
Cloud Resource Manager API. To learn more
about VPC Service Controls, see the
VPC Service Controls overview .
To learn about the current limitations in using Resource Manager with
VPC Service Controls, see the
supported products and limitations
page.
