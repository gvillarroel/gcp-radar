View, update, and delete folders
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to view folder details, update folder settings, and delete folders
using the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or API. Learn how to modify folder display
names and manage folder placement within your organization's hierarchy.
List folders and view folder details
To list folders or to view metadata for a specific folder, such as its display name, parent ID, and
lifecycle state, you must have the Folder Viewer role ( roles/resourcemanager.folderViewer )
or the Organization Viewer role ( roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer ).
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the Manage resources page.
Open Manage resources page
The resource list displays your hierarchy as a table. Select your organization
resource.
Click the arrow next to the organization name to expand the tree view and
see its child folders.
To perform actions, such as moving, deleting, or viewing settings, click the
more_vert Actions at the end of
the row for that specific resource.
Use the Filter bar at the top of the resource list to search for resources
by name, ID, or label.
Using the project picker
Use the project picker in the top navigation bar to switch your active context
to a specific project or folder.
In the top navigation bar of the Google Cloud console, click the project picker.
This is the drop-down menu located next to the Google Cloud logo.
In the dialog that appears, select your organization from the drop-down to
filter the results.
Browse the hierarchy or search for the project or folder you want to switch to.
Clicking a resource in this picker changes your global context, affecting which
resources are visible in other service pages (like Compute Engine or Cloud Storage).
Note: Up to 4000 resources can be displayed in the project picker. If you
don't see a resource that should appear, go to the Manage resources
page and filter the list using the name of that resource.
gcloud
To get details of one folder, use the resource-manager folders describe
command.
gcloud resource-manager folders describe FOLDER_ID
Replace FOLDER_ID with the ID of the folder you want
to view.
To list the child folders of an organization resource, use the
resource-manager folders list command.
gcloud resource-manager folders list \
--organization ORGANIZATION_ID
Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with the ID of the
organization resource for which you want to see a list of child folders.
To list the child folders of a folder resource, use the
resource-manager folders list command.
gcloud resource-manager folders list \
--folder FOLDER_ID
Replace FOLDER_ID with the ID of the
folder resource for which you want to see a list of child folders.
To list the projects under an organization or folder resource or folder, use
the projects list command with the filter argument.
gcloud projects list \
--filter = " parent.id: ' RESOURCE_ID ' "
Replace RESOURCE_ID with the ID of the
organization or folder resource for which you want to see a list of child
projects.
REST
The curl request to get folders:
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${bearer_token}" \
https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/ FOLDER_ID
Replace FOLDER_NAME with the name of the folder, such as folders/123 .
The curl request to list folders:
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${bearer_token}" \
https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/folders?parent= PARENT_NAME
Replace PARENT_NAME with the name of the parent resource
under which you're creating the folder, such as organizations/123 or folders/123 .
Note: The list command and API method only return the direct children of the specified
parent resource. They don't recursively list all folders and projects across the
entire hierarchy. To view the full nested structure, you must list the children
of each sub-folder individually or use the Manage resources page in the Google Cloud console.
Update folders
To update a folder's display name, you must have the Folder Editor role ( roles/resourcemanager.folderEditor )
or the Folder Admin role ( roles/resourcemanager.folderAdmin ) on the folder.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the Manage resources page.
Open Manage resources page
Click the arrow next to the organization name to expand the tree view and
see its child folders.
In the row of the folder you want to update, click the
more_vert Actions menu at the end of
the row, and click Settings .
Enter the new folder name and click Save .
gcloud

gcloud resource-manager folders update FOLDER_ID --display-name = " NEW_DISPLAY_NAME "
Replace the following:
FOLDER_ID : the ID of the folder you want to update.
NEW_DISPLAY_NAME : the new display name for the folder.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
FOLDER_ID : the Google Cloud folder ID
NEW_DISPLAY_NAME : the new display name for the folder
HTTP method and URL:
PATCH https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/folders/ FOLDER_ID ?updateMask=displayName
Request JSON body:
{
"displayName": " NEW_DISPLAY_NAME "
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl

gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v3/folders/ FOLDER_ID ?updateMask=displayName"
PowerShell

"operationType": "UPDATE",
"resourceName": "folders/ FOLDER_ID "
},
"done": false
}
Move a folder into another folder
To move a folder into another folder, you must have the
resourcemanager.folders.move permission for both the source and destination
folders.
Console

Move .
Click Browse to select the folder to which you want to move the
folder.
Click Move .

DESTINATION_FOLDER_ID : the ID of the folder under which you're
moving another folder, for example 98765 .
DISPLAY_NAME : the display name of the folder being moved, for example
"My Awesome Folder."
The Move Folder response:
{
"name": "operations/fm.1234567890",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.resourcemanager.v3.FolderOperation",
"displayName": " DISPLAY_NAME ",

Additional information
When you delete a folder, it enters a soft-deleted state for a 30-day retention
period before being permanently deleted, or hard-deleted.
Soft-delete state : During the 30-day retention period, the folder is marked
for deletion and is no longer active. You can't create new projects or
sub-folders within a soft-deleted folder.
Hard-delete state : After 30 days, Google Cloud permanently removes the
folder and its metadata. This action is irreversible.
Undelete : If you accidentally delete a folder, you can restore it within the
30-day window using the gcloud resource-manager folders undelete command or
the API.
Prerequisites and constraints
Folder must be empty: You can't delete a folder that still contains active
projects or sub-folders. You must first move or delete all child resources.
Required permissions: To delete or undelete a folder, you must have the
Folder Editor ( roles/resourcemanager.folderEditor ) or Folder Admin
( roles/resourcemanager.folderAdmin ) role.
Search
To search for folders matching the specified query, use gcloud alpha resource-manager
folders search , passing the condition in the --query flag. The scope of search
is all the folders for which the user has view permission.
gcloud alpha resource-manager folders search --query="name:vij*"
<table output showing the folders with names starting from vij eg. vijeta, vijay-folder>
gcloud alpha resource-manager folders search --query="state:DELETE_REQUESTED"
<table output showing folders for which delete has been requested>
All folders for which the user has view permission can be shown using the
gcloud folders search command.
gcloud folders search
<table output showing all viewable folders>
Note: The search command is in alpha and can be changed without notice.
