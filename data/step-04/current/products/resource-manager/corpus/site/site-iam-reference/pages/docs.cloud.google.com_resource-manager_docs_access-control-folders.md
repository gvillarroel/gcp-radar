Access control for folders with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud offers Identity and Access Management (IAM) , which
lets you give more granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and
prevents unwanted access to other resources. IAM lets you adopt
the
security principle of least privilege ,
so you grant only the necessary access to your resources.
IAM lets you control who (users) has what access (roles)
to which resources by setting allow policies. Allow policies grant specific
roles to a user giving the user certain permissions.
This page explains the IAM roles that are available at the
Folders level, and how to create and manage allow policies for folders
using the Cloud Resource Manager API. For more information, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Note: You can also use deny policies to prevent principals from using specific
IAM permissions. For more information, see Deny
policies .
Note: If you're getting started with Google Cloud, you can set up your resource
hierarchy and grant initial access as part of the
Google Cloud setup process .
Overview of IAM roles for Folders
To help you configure your IAM roles, the following table lists:
The type of actions you want to enable.
The roles required to perform those actions.
The resource level on which you need to apply those roles.
Note: Allow policies are additive and inherited down the hierarchy.
This means that moving a resource into a folder could grant a user additional
roles on that resource. Conversely, moving a resource out of a folder might mean
losing roles on that resource.

Best practices for using IAM roles and permissions with Folders
When assigning IAM roles and permissions for use with Folders, keep the
following in mind:
Use groups whenever possible to manage principals.
Minimize usage of basic roles, such as owner, editor, and viewer. Instead,
try to use the predefined roles for principle of least privilege.
For folder-wide management, assign permissions at folder level and have
projects inherit them automatically. For example, you could assign a
department administrator group the Folder Admin role on the folder.
Network administrators that need to have department-wide permissions can have
the Network Admin role for the folder.
Carefully consider what permissions might change before moving a resource out
of a folder. Otherwise, you could risk breaking existing apps or workflows
that require those permissions on that resource.
Plan and test your resource hierarchy carefully before moving production
projects under folders. One way to do this is to create a test folder under
your organization resource and creating a prototype of your intended hierarchy
ahead of time.
Granting a role to a user at the folder level will grant the user that role
for every resource underneath that folder as well. For example, if you grant
a user the Compute Admin role ( roles/compute.admin ) on a folder, that user
will have full control of all Compute Engine resources in every project in
that folder.
Understand folder roles and permissions
Folders act as administrative boundaries within your organization, letting you group
projects and apply policies at scale. Access to these folders is managed through
a combination of inherited permissions from the organization and roles granted
directly at the folder level.
Default roles
Creating a folder grants you the Folder Admin and Folder Editor roles,
which provide full control. See the following table for the permissions these
roles provide. You can change these default roles in an allow policy.
Use predefined roles

Creating custom roles
In addition to the predefined roles described in this topic, you can also create
custom roles that are collections of
permissions that you tailor to your needs. When creating a custom role for use
with Resource Manager, be aware of the following points:
List and get permissions, such as resourcemanager.projects.get/list ,
should always be granted as a pair.
When your custom role includes the folders.list and folders.get
permissions, it should also include projects.list and projects.get .
Be aware that the setIamPolicy permission for organization, folder, and
project resources allows the user to grant all other permissions, and so should be assigned with care.
Grant roles to enable folder browsing
List permissions enable folder browsing. The two types of list permissions that
typically need to be granted are resourcemanager.folders.list , which allows
users to list folders under a resource, and resourcemanager.projects.list ,
which allows users to browse projects under an organization resource or folder. The
Organization Administrator is initialized with both of these permissions. For
users that have not been assigned the Organization Administrator role:
resourcemanager.folders.list can be granted using the Folder Viewer and
Folder Editor roles.
resourcemanager.projects.list can be granted using the Viewer or
Browser roles.
For organization resource principals to browse the entire organization resource hierarchy, list
permissions should be granted at the organization resource level.
Grant roles to enable folder creation
Users that need to create folders must be granted Folder Creator role on a
resource in the hierarchy above the level at which the folder will be created.
It can be helpful to grant browsing permissions along with folder creation
permissions so users can effectively navigate to where in the hierarchy the
folder will be created. See the section above for
more information on browsing permissions.
Folder Creator does not grant a user permission to delete a folder. However,
when a person creates a folder, that person is automatically granted the
Folder Editor role. The Folder Editor role enables folder deletion.
Grant roles to enable folder movement
To move a folder from one parent resource to another, users must have
the Folder Mover role on both old and new parent resources, or on a common
ancestor.
Grant roles to enable project movement
To move a project into a folder, users must have the Project Editor or
Project Owner roles on the project and the Project Mover on both the
source and destination parent resources.
This is slightly different from the requirements for moving a non-org-owned
project into the organization resource, where users must have the Project Editor
or Project Owner role on the project and the Project Creator role on
the organization resource.
Grant folder-specific roles to enable project creation
To create projects, users must have the Project Creator role.
However, rather than granting org-wide project creation permission, it can be
useful to instead restrict users to viewing and creating projects only within
a given folder.
To grant folder-specific permissions:
Grant the user the Organization Viewer role at the org node level
(for example, domain.com).
Create a new folder.
Add the user to IAM at the folder level and grant them the Folder Viewer
and Project Creator roles.
This lets the user create projects in their folder without granting them
visibility to every project in the greater organization resource.
