Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster .
To save resources and costs, you can
create a single-node Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster to run the examples presented
in this document.
The subnet in the region where the cluster is created must have
Private Google Access (PGA) enabled.
By default, Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster VMs, created with a
2.2 (default) or later image version, have
internal IP addresses only . To allow cluster VMs to communicate with Google APIs,
enable Private Google Access on the
default (or user-specified network name, if applicable) network subnet
in the region where the cluster is created. .
If you want to run the Zeppelin web interface example in this guide,
you must use or create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster with
the Zeppelin optional component enabled .
Grant roles to a custom service account (if needed): By default,
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster VMs use the
Compute Engine default service account
to interact with Managed Service for Apache Spark. If you want to specify a
custom service account when you
create your cluster, it must have the
Managed Service for Apache Spark Worker role ( roles/dataproc.worker )
role or a custom role with needed Worker role permissions.
