Recreate and update a cluster

Managed Service for Apache Spark prevents the creation of clusters with image versions
prior to 1.3.95, 1.4.77, 1.5.53, and 2.0.27, which were affected by
Apache Log4j security vulnerabilities . Managed Service for Apache Spark also prevents cluster creation for Managed Service for Apache Spark image versions 0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, and 1.2.x.
Managed Service for Apache Spark advises that, when possible, you create Managed Service for Apache Spark
clusters with the latest sub-minor image versions.

Recreate and update a cluster
You can use the gcloud command-line tool or the Managed Service for Apache Spark API
to copy configuration from an existing cluster, update the copied configuration,
and then create a new cluster with the updated configuration.
gcloud CLI
The example instructions show updating the image
version setting in a cluster configuration. You can change the
example to update different cluster configuration settings.
The recommended practice is to specify the major.minor image version for
production environments or when compatibility with specific component versions
is important. The sub-minor and OS distributions are automatically set to
the latest weekly release.
Set variables.
export PROJECT= project-id
export REGION= region
export OLD_CLUSTER= old-cluster-name
export NEW_CLUSTER= new-cluster-name
export NEW_IMAGE_VERSION= image-version (for example, '2.2-debian12')
Export the existing (old) cluster configuration to a YAML file.
gcloud dataproc clusters export $OLD_CLUSTER \
--project=$PROJECT \
--region=$REGION > "${OLD_CLUSTER}-config.yaml"
Update the configuration. The following example uses sed to update the image version.
sed -E "s|(^[[:blank:]]+)imageVersion: .+|\1imageVersion: ${NEW_IMAGE_VERSION}|g" "${OLD_CLUSTER}-config.yaml" | sed -E '/^[[:blank:]]+imageUri: /d' > "${NEW_CLUSTER}-config-updated.yaml"
Create a new cluster with a new name and the updated configuration.
gcloud dataproc clusters import $NEW_CLUSTER \
--project=$PROJECT \
--region=$REGION \
--source="${NEW_CLUSTER}-config-updated.yaml"
After confirming your workloads run in the new cluster without issues,
delete the existing (old) cluster. IMPORTANT: This step deletes all
data stored in HDFS and on local disk in your cluster.
gcloud dataproc clusters delete $OLD_CLUSTER \
--project=$PROJECT \
--region=$REGION
REST API
The example instructions show updating the cluster name and the image
version settings in a cluster configuration. You can change the
example variables to update different cluster configuration settings.
The recommended practice is to specify the major.minor image version for
production environments or when compatibility with specific component versions
is important. The sub-minor and OS distributions are automatically set to
the latest weekly release.
Set variables.
export PROJECT= project-id
export REGION= region
export OLD_CLUSTER= old-cluster-name
export NEW_CLUSTER= new-cluster-name
export NEW_IMAGE_VERSION= image-version (for example, '2.2-debian12')
Export the existing (old) cluster configuration to a JSON file.
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/regions/${REGION}/clusters/${OLD_CLUSTER}?alt=json" > "${OLD_CLUSTER}-config.json"
Update the configuration. The following example uses jq to update the cluster name and the image version.
jq ".clusterName = \"${NEW_CLUSTER}\" | .config.softwareConfig.imageVersion=\"${NEW_IMAGE_VERSION}\" | del(.config.workerConfig.imageUri) | del(.config.masterConfig.imageUri)" "${OLD_CLUSTER}-config.json" > "${NEW_CLUSTER}-config-updated.json"
Import the updated cluster configuration to create a new cluster with the updated configuration.
curl -i -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -d "@${NEW_CLUSTER}-config-updated.json" "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/regions/${REGION}/clusters?alt=json"
After confirming your workloads run in the new cluster without issues, delete the existing (old) cluster. IMPORTANT: This step deletes all data stored in HDFS and on local disk in your cluster.
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/regions/${REGION}/clusters/${OLD_CLUSTER}"
Console
The console does not support recreating a cluster by importing
a cluster configuration.
