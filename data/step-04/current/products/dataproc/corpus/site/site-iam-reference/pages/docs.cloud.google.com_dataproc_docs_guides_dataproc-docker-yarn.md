Customize your Spark job runtime environment with Docker on YARN
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Managed Service for Apache Spark Docker on YARN feature allows you
to create and use a Docker image to customize your
Spark job runtime environment. The image can include customizations to
Java, Python, and R dependencies, and to your job jar.
Limitations
Feature availability or support is not available with:
Managed Service for Apache Spark image versions prior to 2.0.49 (not available in 1.5 images)
MapReduce jobs (only supported for Spark jobs )
Spark client mode (only supported with Spark cluster mode)
Kerberos clusters :
cluster creation fails if you create a cluster with Docker on YARN
and Kerberos enabled.
Customizations of JDK, Hadoop and Spark: the host JDK, Hadoop, and Spark
are used, not your customizations.
Create a Docker image
The first step to customize your Spark environment is
building a Docker image .
Dockerfile
You can use the following Dockerfile as an example, making changes and
additions to meet you needs.
FROM debian:10-slim
# Suppress interactive prompts.
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND = noninteractive

RUN groupadd -g 1099 yarn_docker_user
RUN useradd -u 1099 -g 1099 -d /home/yarn_docker_user -m yarn_docker_user
USER yarn_docker_user
Build and push the image
The following is commands for building and pushing the example Docker image, you
can make changes according to your customizations.
# Increase the version number when there is a change to avoid referencing
# a cached older image. Avoid reusing the version number, including the default
# `latest` version.
IMAGE = gcr.io/my-project/my-image:1.0.1
# Download the BigQuery connector.
gcloud storage cp \
gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-with-dependencies_2.12-0.22.2.jar .
# Download the Miniconda3 installer.
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
# Python module example:
cat >test_util.py <<EOF
def hello ( name ) :
print ( "hello {}" .format ( name ))
def read_lines ( path ) :
with open ( path ) as f:
return f.readlines ()
EOF
# Build and push the image.
docker build -t " ${ IMAGE } " .
docker push " ${ IMAGE } "
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
After creating a Docker image
that customizes your Spark environment, create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
that will use your Docker image when running Spark jobs.
gcloud
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--image-version= DP_IMAGE \
--optional-components=DOCKER \
--properties=dataproc:yarn.docker.enable=true,dataproc:yarn.docker.image= DOCKER_IMAGE \
other flags
Replace the following;
CLUSTER_NAME : The cluster name.
REGION : The cluster region.
DP_IMAGE : Managed Service for Apache Spark image version must be 2.0.49
or later ( --image-version=2.0 will use a qualified minor version later than 2.0.49 ).
--optional-components=DOCKER : Enables the
Docker component on the cluster.
--properties flag:
dataproc:yarn.docker.enable=true : Required property to enable the
Managed Service for Apache Spark Docker on YARN feature.
dataproc:yarn.docker.image : Optional property that you can add to specify
your DOCKER_IMAGE using the
following Container Registry image naming format:
{hostname}/{project-id}/{image}:{tag} .
Example:
dataproc:yarn.docker.image=gcr.io/project-id/image:1.0.1
Requirement: You must host your Docker image on
Container Registry or
Artifact Registry . (Managed Service for Apache Spark cannot fetch
containers from other registries).
Recommendation: Add this property when you create your cluster
to cache your Docker image and avoid YARN timeouts later when
you submit a job that uses the image.
When dataproc:yarn.docker.enable is set to true , Dataproc
updates Hadoop and Spark configurations to enable the Docker on YARN feature in
the cluster. For example, spark.submit.deployMode is set to cluster , and
spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_MOUNTS and
spark.executorEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_MOUNTS are set to mount
directories from the host into the container.
Submit a Spark job to the cluster
After creating a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster , submit
a Spark job to the cluster that uses your Docker image. The example
in this section submits a PySpark job to the cluster.
Set job properties:
# Set the Docker image URI.
IMAGE =( e.g., gcr.io/my-project/my-image:1.0.1 )
# Required: Use `#` as the delimiter for properties to avoid conflicts.
JOB_PROPERTIES = '^#^'
# Required: Set Spark properties with the Docker image.
JOB_PROPERTIES = " ${ JOB_PROPERTIES } #spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_IMAGE= ${ IMAGE } "
JOB_PROPERTIES = " ${ JOB_PROPERTIES } #spark.executorEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_IMAGE= ${ IMAGE } "
# Optional: Add custom jars to Spark classpath. Don't set these properties if
# there are no customizations.
JOB_PROPERTIES = " ${ JOB_PROPERTIES } #spark.driver.extraClassPath=/opt/spark/jars/*"
JOB_PROPERTIES = " ${ JOB_PROPERTIES } #spark.executor.extraClassPath=/opt/spark/jars/*"
# Optional: Set custom PySpark Python path only if there are customizations.
JOB_PROPERTIES = " ${ JOB_PROPERTIES } #spark.pyspark.python=/opt/miniconda3/bin/python"
JOB_PROPERTIES = " ${ JOB_PROPERTIES } #spark.pyspark.driver.python=/opt/miniconda3/bin/python"
# Optional: Set custom Python module path only if there are customizations.
# Since the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable defined in the Dockerfile is
# overridden by Spark, it must be set as a job property.
JOB_PROPERTIES = " ${ JOB_PROPERTIES } #spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.PYTHONPATH=/opt/python/packages"
JOB_PROPERTIES = " ${ JOB_PROPERTIES } #spark.executorEnv.PYTHONPATH=/opt/python/packages"
Notes:
See Launching Applications Using Docker Containers
information on related properties.
gcloud
Submit the job to the cluster.
gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark PYFILE \
--cluster= CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--properties=${JOB_PROPERTIES}
Replace the following;
PYFILE : The file path to your PySpark job file. It can be
a local file path or the URI of the file in Cloud Storage
( gs:// BUCKET_NAME / PySpark filename ).
CLUSTER_NAME : The cluster name.
REGION : The cluster region.
