Cloud Profiler
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud Profiler continuously gathers and reports
application CPU usage and memory-allocation information.
Requirements:
Profiler supports only Managed Service for Apache Spark
Hadoop and Spark job types (Spark, PySpark, SparkSql, and SparkR).
Jobs must run longer than 3 minutes to allow Profiler
to collect and upload data to your project.
Managed Service for Apache Spark recognizes cloud.profiler.enable and the other
cloud.profiler.* properties (see
Profiler options ), and then appends
the relevant profiler JVM options to the following configurations:
Spark: spark.driver.extraJavaOptions and spark.executor.extraJavaOptions
MapReduce: mapreduce.task.profile and other mapreduce.task.profile.*
properties
Note: Overriding Spark or MapReduce properties in your job
(for example, by manually constructing a SparkConf and setting
spark.executor.extraJavaOptions ), prevents the setting of
profiler options. However, if you provide extraJavaOptions using the
gcloud dataproc jobs submit (spark|hadoop) --properties flag,
Managed Service for Apache Spark retains and sets profiler options.
Enable profiling
Complete the following steps to enable and use the Profiler
on your Managed Service for Apache Spark Spark and Hadoop jobs.
Enable the Profiler .
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
with service account scopes
set to monitoring to allow the cluster to talk to the profiler service.
If you are using a
custom VM service account ,
grant the Cloud Profiler Agent role to the custom VM service account. This
role contains required profiler service permissions.
gcloud
gcloud dataproc clusters create cluster-name \
--scopes=cloud-platform \
--region= region \
other args ...
Submit a Managed Service for Apache Spark job with Profiler options
Submit a Managed Service for Apache Spark Spark or Hadoop job
with one or more of the following Profiler options:
Option
Description
Value
Required/Optional
Default
Notes
cloud.profiler.enable
Enable profiling of the job
true or false
Required
false
cloud.profiler.name
Name used to create profile on the Profiler Service
profile-name
Optional
Managed Service for Apache Spark job UUID
cloud.profiler.service.version
A user-supplied string to identify and distinguish profiler results.
Profiler Service Version
Optional
Managed Service for Apache Spark job UUID
mapreduce.task.profile.maps
Numeric range of map tasks to profile (example: for up to 100, specify "0-100")
number range
Optional
0-10000
Applies to Hadoop mapreduce jobs only
mapreduce.task.profile.reduces
Numeric range of reducer tasks to profile (example: for up to 100, specify "0-100")
number range
Optional
0-10000
Applies to Hadoop mapreduce jobs only
PySpark Example
Google Cloud CLI
PySpark job submit with profiling example:
gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark python-job-file \
--cluster= cluster-name \
--region= region \
--properties=cloud.profiler.enable=true,cloud.profiler.name= profiler_name ,cloud.profiler.service.version= version \
-- job args
Two profiles will be created:
profiler_name -driver to profile spark driver tasks
profiler_name -executor to profile spark executor tasks
For example, if the profiler_name is "spark_word_count_job",
spark_word_count_job-driver and spark_word_count_job-executor
profiles are created.
Hadoop Example
gcloud CLI
Hadoop (teragen mapreduce) job submit with profiling example:
gcloud dataproc jobs submit hadoop \
--cluster= cluster-name \
--region= region \
--jar= jar-file \
--properties=cloud.profiler.enable=true,cloud.profiler.name= profiler_name ,cloud.profiler.service.version= version \
-- teragen 100000 gs:// bucket-name
View profiles
View profiles from the Profiler on
the Google Cloud console.
