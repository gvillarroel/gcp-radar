Use Secret Manager credential provider
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Objective: Learn how to use the Secret Manager
as a credential store with Managed Service for Apache Spark to safely store and access sensitive
data processed by applications running on a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
The Secret Manager can
safeguard your sensitive data, such as your API keys, passwords, and
certificates. You can use it to manage, access, and audit your secrets across
Google Cloud.
You can configure a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster or job
to use a Secret Manager secret by using the
the Secret Manager credential provider.
Availability
This feature is available for use with Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters created
with image versions 2.0.97+, 2.1.41+, 2.2.6+, or later major
Managed Service for Apache Spark image versions .
Note: This feature is also available for use with Managed Service for Apache Spark
runtime versions 1.2, 2.2, or later major
Managed Service for Apache Spark runtime versions .
For Managed Service for Apache Spark information, see
Secret Manager credential provider for Managed Service for Apache Spark .
Terminology
The following table describes terms used in this document.
Term
Description
Secret
A Secret Manager
secret is a global project object that contains a collection of metadata
and secret versions. You can store, manage, and access secrets as
binary blobs or text strings.
Credential
In Hadoop and other Managed Service for Apache Spark-hosted applications, a
credential consists of a credential name (ID) and credential value (password).
A credential ID and value map to a Secret Manager
secret ID and secret value (secret version).
Usage
You can configure
Hadoop and other OSS components
to work with the Secret Manager by setting the following
properties when you create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster or submit a job.
Provider path : The provider path property, hadoop.security.credential.provider.path ,
is a comma-separated list of one or more credential provider URIs that is traversed to resolve a credential.
--properties=hadoop.security.credential.provider.path=gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID
The scheme in the provider path indicates the credential provider type.
Hadoop schemes include
jceks:// , user:// , localjceks:// . Use the gsm:// scheme
to search for credentials in Secret Manager.
Substitute dot operator : The Secret Manager service does not allow dots ( . ) in secret names. However, some open source software (OSS) components use dots in their credential keys. To fix this limitation, enable this property to replace dots ( . ) with hyphens ( - ) in credential names. This ensures that OSS credentials with dots in their names can be stored and retrieved correctly from Secret Manager.
For example,
If an OSS credential key is a.b.c , you must modify it to a-b-c when storing it in Secret Manager.
--properties=hadoop.security.credstore.google-secret-manager.secret-id.substitute-dot-operator=true
This is an optional property. By default, the value is false . For credentials keys that have no dot ( . ) operator in their credential name, this property can be safely ignored.
Secret version : Secrets in Secret Manager can have multiple versions (values). Use this property to access a specific secret version for stable access in production environments.
--properties=hadoop.security.credstore.google-secret-manager.secret-version=1
This is an optional property. By default, Secret Manager
accesses the LATEST version, which resolves to the latest value of the secret at runtime. If your use case is to always access the LATEST version of a secret, this property can be safely ignored.
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster with Secret Manager credential provider
Run the following command locally or in Cloud Shell to
create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
with the required properties.
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--properties="hadoop:hadoop.security.credential.provider.path=gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID ,hadoop:hadoop.security.credstore.google-secret-manager.secret-id.substitute-dot-operator=true" \
...other flags as needed...
Notes:
CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the new cluster.
REGION : A Compute Engine region
where your workload will run.
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID is listed in the Project info section
of the Google Cloud console dashboard .
Submit a Managed Service for Apache Spark with Secret Manager credential provider
Run the following command locally or in Cloud Shell to
submit a Managed Service for Apache Spark job
with the required properties.
gcloud dataproc jobs submit CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--properties="hadoop.security.credential.provider.path=gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID ,hadoop.security.credstore.google-secret-manager.secret-id.substitute-dot-operator=true" \
...other flags as needed... \
-- job-args
Notes:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster that will run the job.
REGION : a Compute Engine region
where your workload will run.
PROJECT_ID : your project ID is listed in the Project info section
of the Google Cloud console dashboard .
Use Secret Manager with Hive Metastore
The Hive Metastore property, javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword , contains
the password used to authenticate access to the metastore database. The
password is saved in text format in hive-site.xml , which represents
a security risk. A production best-practice is to store the password
in Secret Manager, then update the hive-site.xml config
file to allow the Hive metastore service to read the password
from Secret Manager.
The following examples show you how to use Secret Manager in
different Hive Metastore scenarios.
Create a cluster with a local metastore
Run the following command locally or in Cloud Shell to
create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster .
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
...other flags as needed... \
Notes:
CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the new cluster.
REGION : A Compute Engine region
where your workload will run.
Create a secret using the Secret Manager
or the hadoop credential command.
Run hadoop credential and other commands listed in the
following examples from the Managed Service for Apache Spark master node command line after
using SSH to connect
to and open a terminal window on that node.
Alternative 1: Use the Secret Manager to create a secret .
Secret name: /projects/ PROJECT_ID /secrets/javax-jdo-option-ConnectionPassword/versions/1
Secret value: METASTORE_PASSWORD .
Alternative 2: Use the hadoop credential command to create a secret.
sudo hadoop credential create javax-jdo-option-ConnectionPassword -provider gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID -v METASTORE_PASSWORD
METASTORE_PASSWORD : Since the Secret Manager does
not support the dot( . ) operator, substitute any dot( . )s in the password
with hyphen( - )s.
Verify that the secret exists.
sudo hadoop credential list -provider gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID
Use a text editor to remove the javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword property from the hive-site.xml file, and then add the hadoop.security.credential.provider.path & hadoop.security.credstore.google-secret-manager.secret-id.substitute-dot-operator properties to the file.
Example properties:
hadoop.security.credential.provider.path=gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID
hadoop.security.credstore.google-secret-manager.secret-id.substitute-dot-operator=true
Restart Hive Metastore.
sudo systemctl restart hive-metastore
Create a cluster with an external Hive Metastore
Run the following command locally or in Cloud Shell to
create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
with the following cluster properties.
Use this cluster as an external Hive metastore for Hive jobs that run from other Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters
for Spark Hive workloads.
gcloud dataproc clusters create METASTORE_CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--properties=core:fs.defaultFS=gs:// METASTORE_CLUSTER_PROXY_BUCKET ,dataproc:dataproc.components.deactivate="hdfs hive-server2 hive-metastore" \
...other flags as needed...
Create a secret using the Secret Manager
or the hadoop credential command.
Run hadoop credential and other commands listed in the
following examples from the Managed Service for Apache Spark master node command line after
using SSH to connect
to and open a terminal window on that node.
Alternative 1: Use the Secret Manager to create a secret .
Secret name: /projects/ PROJECT_ID /secrets/javax-jdo-option-ConnectionPassword/versions/1
Secret value: METASTORE_PASSWORD .
Alternative 2: Use the hadoop credential command to create a secret.
sudo hadoop credential create javax-jdo-option-ConnectionPassword -provider gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID -v METASTORE_PASSWORD
METASTORE_PASSWORD : Since the Secret Manager does
not support the dot( . ) operator, substitute dot( . )s in the password
with hyphen( - )s.
Verify that the secret exists.
sudo hadoop credential list -provider gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID
Create a cluster to run Hive jobs that connect to an external metastore
Run the following command locally or in Cloud Shell to
create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
with the following cluster properties.
Use this cluster to run Hive jobs that connect to the external metastore
on another Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--properties="hive:javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=jdbc:mysql:// METASTORE_CLUSTER_NAME -m/metastore,hive:hadoop.security.credential.provider.path=gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID ,hive:hadoop.security.credstore.google-secret-manager.secret-id.substitute-dot-operator=true" \
...other flags as needed...
Hadoop credential commands
You can use SSH
to connect to the Managed Service for Apache Spark master node
to use hadoop credential command to create, list, and manage secrets.
hadoop credential commands use the following format:
hadoop credential SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS .
In the following examples, the -provider flag is added to specify the
provider type and location (the provider store). The gsm:// scheme specifies
the Secret Manager.
Create a secret with the specified secret ID. The command doesn't create the
secret if the specified secret ID exists. This behavior is consistent with
the Hadoop CredentialProvider API.
hadoop credential create SECRET_ID -provider gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID -v VALUE
List secrets stored in a project.
hadoop credential list -provider gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID
Check if a secret exists in a project with a specified value.
hadoop credential check SECRET_ID -provider gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID -v VALUE
Check for a specific secret version in a config file.
hadoop credential conf CONFIG_FILE check SECRET_ID -provider gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID -v VALUE
CONFIG_FILE : The XML file that sets hadoop.security.credstore.google-secret-manager.secret-version .
Delete all versions of a secret in a project.
hadoop credential delete SECRET_ID -provider gsm://projects/ PROJECT_ID
