real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Dataproc, Compute Engine, and Cloud Storage APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
Create a service account:
Ensure that you have the Create Service Accounts IAM role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator ) and the Project IAM Admin role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin ). Learn how to grant
roles .
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create service account page.
Go to Create service account
Select your project.
In the Service account name field, enter a name. The Google Cloud console fills
in the Service account ID field based on this name.
In the Service account description field, enter a description. For example,
Service account for quickstart .
Click Create and continue .
Grant the Project > Owner role to the service account.
To grant the role, find the Select a role list, then select
Project > Owner .
Note : The Role field affects which resources the service account can access in your
project. You can revoke these roles or grant additional roles later.
In production environments, do not grant the Owner, Editor, or Viewer roles. Instead, grant a
predefined role or
custom role that meets your needs.
Click Continue .

Set local environment variables. Set environment variables on your
local machine. Set your Google Cloud project-id and the name of the
Cloud Storage bucket you will use for this tutorial. Also provide the
name and region
of an existing or new Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
You can create a cluster to use in this tutorial in the next step.
PROJECT= project-id
BUCKET_NAME= bucket-name
CLUSTER= cluster-name
REGION= cluster-region Example: "us-central1"
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster. Run the command, below, to
create a single-node
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster in the specified
Compute Engine zone .
gcloud dataproc clusters create ${CLUSTER} \
--project=${PROJECT} \
--region=${REGION} \
--single-node
The above command installs the default
cluster image version .
You can use the
--image-version
flag to select an image version for your cluster. Each image version installs
specific versions of Spark and Scala library components. If you
prepare the Spark wordcount job
in Java or Scala, you will reference the Spark and Scala versions installed
on your cluster when you prepare the job package.
Copy public data to your Cloud Storage bucket. Copy a public data
Shakespeare text snippet into the input folder of your
Cloud Storage bucket:
gcloud storage cp gs://pub/shakespeare/rose.txt \
gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/input/rose.txt
Set up a Java (Apache Maven) ,
Scala (SBT) , or
Python
development environment.
Use Cloud Shell .
Cloud Shell includes
tools used in this tutorial, including Apache Maven, Python,
and the Google Cloud CLI.
Prepare the Spark wordcount job
Select a tab, below, to follow the steps to prepare a job package or file
to submit to your cluster. You can prepare one of the following job types;
Spark job in Java
using Apache Maven to build a
JAR package
Spark job in Scala using
SBT to build a
JAR package
Spark job in Python (PySpark)
Java
Copy pom.xml file to your local machine.
The following pom.xml file specifies Scala and Spark library
dependencies, which are given a provided scope to
indicate that the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster will provide these
libraries at runtime. The pom.xml file does not specify a
Cloud Storage dependency because the connector implements the standard
HDFS interface. When a Spark job accesses Cloud Storage cluster files
(files with URIs that start with gs:// ), the system
automatically uses the Cloud Storage connector to access the
files in Cloud Storage
Check your cluster image version.
Replace the version placeholders in the file to show the
Spark and Scala library versions used by your cluster's
image version .
Note that the spark-core_ artifact number is the Scala
major.minor version number.

src/main/java/dataproc/codelab :
mkdir -p src/main/java/dataproc/codelab
Copy WordCount.java to your local machine into
src/main/java/dataproc/codelab :
cp WordCount.java src/main/java/dataproc/codelab
WordCount.java is a Spark job in Java that reads text files
from Cloud Storage, performs a word count, then writes the text file
results to Cloud Storage.
package dataproc.codelab ;
import java.util.Arrays ;
import org.apache.spark.SparkConf ;
import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaPairRDD ;
import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDD ;
import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaSparkContext ;
import scala.Tuple2 ;
public class WordCount {
public static void main ( String [] args ) {
if ( args . length != 2 ) {
throw new IllegalArgumentException ( "Exactly 2 arguments are required: <inputUri> <outputUri>" );
}
String inputPath = args [ 0 ] ;
String outputPath = args [ 1 ] ;
JavaSparkContext sparkContext = new JavaSparkContext ( new SparkConf (). setAppName ( "Word Count" ));
JavaRDD<String> lines = sparkContext . textFile ( inputPath );

). reduceByKey (
( Integer count1 , Integer count2 ) - > count1 + count2
);
wordCounts . saveAsTextFile ( outputPath );
}
}
Build the package.
mvn clean package
If the build is successful, a target/word-count-1.0.jar
is created.
Stage the package to Cloud Storage.
gcloud storage cp target/word-count-1.0.jar \
gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/java/word-count-1.0.jar
Scala
Copy build.sbt file to your local machine.
The following build.sbt file specifies Scala and Spark library
dependencies, which are given a provided scope to
indicate that the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster will provide these
libraries at runtime. The build.sbt file does not specify a
Cloud Storage dependency because the connector implements the standard
HDFS interface. When a Spark job accesses Cloud Storage cluster files
(files with URIs that start with gs:// ), the system
automatically uses the Cloud Storage connector to access the
files in Cloud Storage
Check your cluster image verison.
Replace the version placeholders in the file to show the
Spark and Scala library versions used by your cluster's
image version .
scalaVersion := " Scala version, for example, 2.11.8 "
name := "word-count"
organization := "dataproc.codelab"
version := "1.0"
libraryDependencies ++ = Seq (
"org.scala-lang" % "scala-library" % scalaVersion . value % "provided" ,
"org.apache.spark" %% "spark-core" % " Spark version, for example, 2.3.1 " % "provided"
)
Copy word-count.scala to your local machine.
This is a Spark job in Java that reads text files from
Cloud Storage, performs a word count, then writes
the text file results to Cloud Storage.

def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) {
if ( args . length != 2 ) {
throw new IllegalArgumentException (
"Exactly 2 arguments are required: <inputPath> <outputPath>" )
}
val inputPath = args ( 0 )
val outputPath = args ( 1 )
val sc = new SparkContext ( new SparkConf (). setAppName ( "Word Count" ))
val lines = sc . textFile ( inputPath )
val words = lines . flatMap ( line = > line . split ( " " ))
val wordCounts = words . map ( word = > ( word , 1 )). reduceByKey ( _ + _ )
wordCounts . saveAsTextFile ( outputPath )
}
}
Build the package.
sbt clean package
If the build is successful, a target/scala-2.11/word-count_2.11-1.0.jar
is created.
Stage the package to Cloud Storage.
gcloud storage cp target/scala-2.11/word-count_2.11-1.0.jar \
gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/scala/word-count_2.11-1.0.jar
Python
Copy word-count.py to your local machine.
This is a Spark job in Python using PySpark that reads text files from
Cloud Storage, performs a word count, then writes
the text file results to Cloud Storage.
# !/ usr / bin / env python
import pyspark
import sys
if len ( sys . argv ) != 3 :
raise Exception ( "Exactly 2 arguments are required: <inputUri> <outputUri>" )
inputUri = sys . argv [ 1 ]
outputUri = sys . argv [ 2 ]
sc = pyspark . SparkContext ()
lines = sc . textFile ( sys . argv [ 1 ] )
words = lines . flatMap ( lambda line : line . split ())
wordCounts = words . map ( lambda word : ( word , 1 )). reduceByKey ( lambda count1 , count2 : count1 + count2 )
wordCounts . saveAsTextFile ( sys . argv [ 2 ] )
Submit the job
Run the following gcloud command to submit the wordcount job to your
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
Java
gcloud dataproc jobs submit spark \
--cluster=${CLUSTER} \
--class=dataproc.codelab.WordCount \
--jars=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/java/word-count-1.0.jar \
--region=${REGION} \
-- gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/input/ gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/output/
Scala
gcloud dataproc jobs submit spark \

Python
gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark word-count.py \
--cluster=${CLUSTER} \
--region=${REGION} \
-- gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/input/ gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/output/
View the output
After the job finishes, run the following gcloud CLI
command to view the wordcount output.
gcloud storage cat gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/output/*
The wordcount output should be similar to the following:
(a,2)
(call,1)
(What's,1)
(sweet.,1)
(we,1)
(as,1)
(name?,1)
(any,1)
(other,1)
(rose,1)
(smell,1)
(name,1)
(would,1)
(in,1)
(which,1)
(That,1)
(By,1)
Clean up
After you finish the tutorial, you can clean up the resources that you created so that they
stop using quota and incurring charges. The following sections describe how to delete or turn off
these resources.
Delete the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
Instead of deleting your project, you might want to only delete your cluster within the project.
Delete the Cloud Storage bucket
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage
Buckets page.
Go to Buckets
Click the checkbox for the bucket that you want to delete.
To delete the bucket,
click delete Delete , and then follow the
instructions.
Command line
Delete the bucket:
gcloud storage buckets delete BUCKET_NAME
Important: Your bucket must
be empty before you can delete it.
