"View Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster diagnostic data"
You can take advantage of the following Managed Service for Apache Spark diagnostic data
collection features to troubleshoot cluster and job issues:
Checkpoint diagnostic data :
By default, Managed Service for Apache Spark collects checkpoint
diagnostic data during the cluster lifecycle.
Snapshot diagnostic data :
You can collect a one-time snapshot of cluster diagnostic data when needed.
Checkpoint diagnostic data collection
By default, Managed Service for Apache Spark collects
checkpoint diagnostic data
during cluster creation ,
cluster update , and
Managed Service for Apache Spark job operations.
Checkpoint data location
Managed Service for Apache Spark saves checkpoint diagnostic data
in the cluster temp bucket
in Cloud Storage in the following folder (the checkpoint diagnostic data folder ):
gs:// TEMP_BUCKET /google-cloud-dataproc-diagnostic/ CLUSTER_UUID
You can run the
gcloud dataproc clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME
command to list the cluster temp bucket
The default cluster temp bucket has a TTL retention period of 90 days. The data
is deleted at the end of the retention period. You can
specify your own cluster temp bucket
with a different TTL period when you
create a cluster.
Checkpoint diagnostic data
Cluster node detail logs: Managed Service for Apache Spark runs the following commands
to collect and write YARN and HDFS information to the following
locations in the checkpoint diagnostic data folder in Cloud Storage.
Command executed
Location in diagnostic folder
yarn node -list -all
.../nodes/ timestamp /yarn-nodes.log
hdfs dfsadmin -report -live -decommissioning
.../nodes/ timestamp /hdfs-nodes.log
cp gs:// STAGING_BUCKET /google-cloud-dataproc-metainfo/ CLUSTER_UUID /nodes_exclude.xml
.../nodes/ timestamp /nodes_exclude.xml
Note: Node detail snapshots capture cluster updates. The timestamp field in
the path indicates the snapshot time.
Job Details: Managed Service for Apache Spark saves MapReduce job information and
Spark job logs for jobs using the Managed Service for Apache Spark Jobs API. This
job data is collected for each MapReduce and spark job submitted.
MapReduce job.xml : A file containing job configuration settings,
saved at .../jobs/ JOB_UUID /mapreduce/job.xml .
Spark event logs: Job execution details useful for debugging,
saved at .../jobs/ JOB_UUID /spark/application-id .
Linux system information: Managed Service for Apache Spark runs the following
commands to collect and save system information in the following locations
in the checkpoint diagnostic data folder in Cloud Storage.
Command
Location in diagnostics folder
sysctl -a
.../system/sysctl.log
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr

Share checkpoint diagnostic data with support
You can enable sharing checkpoint diagnostic data with
Google Cloud support in the
following ways:
Enable sharing at cluster creation : Add the following
optional cluster property
when you create a cluster :
dataproc:diagnostic.capture.access=GOOGLE_DATAPROC_DIAGNOSE
This property automatically shares collected checkpoint diagnostic data with
Google Cloud support so that you
don't have to manually share after cluster creation each time.
Note: If you enable uniform bucket-level access
on the cluster temp bucket, all of the temp bucket contents, including collected
checkpoint diagnostic data and ephemeral data, such as MapReduce job history
files, aggregated YARN logs, and Spark event logs, is shared with
Google Cloud support.
If object-level access control is enabled on the cluster temp bucket, only
collected checkpoint diagnostic data (data in the checkpoint diagnostic data folder in
Cloud Storage) is shared.
Enable sharing after cluster creation : You can enable sharing checkpoint data
with Google Cloud support
after cluster creation by providing read access to checkpoint data to the
service account used by the Google Cloud support, as follows:
If uniform bucket-level access is enabled on the temp bucket,
add IAM policy binding:
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// TEMP_BUCKET \
--member=serviceAccount:cloud-diagnose@cloud-dataproc.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role=roles/storage.objectViewer
If object-level access control is enabled on the temp bucket,
run the following command to share checkpoint diagnostic data:
gcloud storage objects update \
gs:// TEMP_BUCKET /google-cloud-dataproc-diagnostic/ CLUSTER_UUID \
--add-acl-grant=entity=user-cloud-diagnose@cloud-dataproc.iam.gserviceaccount.com,role=READER --recursive
Disable checkpoint diagnostic data collection
To disable the collection of checkpoint diagnostic data on a cluster, set
dataproc:diagnostic.capture.enabled=false
when you create the cluster.
Snapshot diagnostic data collection
You can run the following
gcloud dataproc clusters diagnose
command to collect a snapshot of diagnostic data from a
running cluster. The data is written as an archive (tar) file to the Managed Service for Apache Spark
staging bucket in
Cloud Storage.
gcloud dataproc clusters diagnose CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--tarball-access=GOOGLE_DATAPROC_DIAGNOSE \
--tarball-gcs-dir= TARBALL_DIR
Notes:
CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the cluster to diagnose.
REGION : The cluster's region, for example, us-central1 .
--tarball-access = GOOGLE_DATAPROC_DIAGNOSE This flag
provides access to the diagnostic tar file to
Google Cloud support .
Provide Google Cloud support with the Cloud Storage path of the
diagnostic tar file.
As an alternative to providing the tar file to support, you can
provide the cluster UUID, operation ID of the diagnose command,
and the Cloud Storage location of the cluster configuration bucket.
If you choose to write diagnostic tar file to a specific directory,
provide Google Cloud support with the full Cloud Storage path
of the tar file which is printed by the diagnose command.
Bucket access and scope of shared content : The access setting
on the Cloud Storage bucket that contains the diagnostic
tar file determines the scope of the content shared with Google Cloud support:
Uniform bucket-level access : If
uniform bucket-level access
is enabled on the Managed Service for Apache Spark staging bucket or,
if a TARBALL_DIR is specified, on the bucket that contains the
TARBALL_DIR , all of the bucket contents are shared with
Google Cloud support.
Object-level access : If object-level access
is enabled on the Managed Service for Apache Spark staging bucket or,
if a TARBALL_DIR is specified, on the bucket that contains the
TARBALL_DIR , only the diagnostic tar file is shared with
Google Cloud support.
TARBALL_DIR : Optional. You can use this flag to specify
a Cloud Storage directory where the diagnostic tar file will
be written. If this flag is omitted, the diagnostic tar file will be
written to the
Managed Service for Apache Spark staging bucket .
Additional flags :
--start-time with --end-time : Use both flags to specify a time
range in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ format for the collection of
diagnostic data. Specifying a time range also enables the collection of
Managed Service for Apache Spark autoscaling logs during the time range (by
default, Managed Service for Apache Spark autoscaling logs are not collected in
the diagnostic snapshot data).
You can use either of both of the following flags to collect specific
job driver, Spark event, YARN application, and
Sparklens output
logs:
--job-ids : A comma-separated list of job IDs
--yarn-application-ids : A comma-separated list of YARN application IDs
YARN log aggregation must be enabled ( yarn.log-aggregation-enable=true )
for the collection of YARN
application logs.
For MapReduce jobs, YARN application logs only are collected.
Optional: Run the diagnostic script
The gcloud dataproc clusters diagnose command can fail or time-out if a
cluster is in an error state and cannot accept diagnose tasks from the
Managed Service for Apache Spark server. As an alternative to running the diagnose command, you
can use SSH to connect to the cluster
then run the script locally on the master node.
gcloud compute ssh HOSTNAME
gcloud storage cp gs://dataproc-diagnostic-scripts/diagnostic-script.sh .
sudo bash diagnostic-script.sh
The diagnostic archive tar file is saved in a local directory. The command
output lists the location of the tar file with instructions on how to upload the
tar file to a Cloud Storage bucket.
Diagnostic snapshot data
Cluster snapshot data includes a diagnostic summary and several archive sections.
Diagnostic summary: The archive file includes summary.txt that is
at the root of the archive. It provides an overview of cluster status,
including YARN, HDFS, disk, and networking status, and includes warnings to
alert you to potential problems.
Archive sections: The archive file includes the following information
that is written to the following archive file locations.

Sensitive log information: If you pass
sensitive information in arguments, metadata, or driver output, your logs may
contain sensitive information. Check archive file contents before sharing the
archive.
You can share the archive file with Google Cloud support or users to
obtain help to troubleshoot cluster or job issues.
To share the archive file:
Copy the archive file
from Cloud Storage, and then share the downloaded archive, or
Change the permissions
on the archive to allow other Google Cloud users or projects to access the
file.
