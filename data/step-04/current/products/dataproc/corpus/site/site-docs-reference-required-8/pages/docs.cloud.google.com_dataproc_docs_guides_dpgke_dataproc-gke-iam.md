Data plane Identity
Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE uses
GKE workload identity
to allow pods within the Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster to act with
the authority of the default
Managed Service for Apache Spark VM service account (data plane identity) .
Workload identity requires the following permissions
to update IAM policies on the GSA used by your Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE
virtual cluster:
compute.projects.get
iam.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy
iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy
Note: You can use workload identity with a different GSA: see
Custom IAM configuration .
GKE workload identity links the following
GKE Service Accounts (KSAs) to the Managed Service for Apache Spark VM Service Account:
agent KSA (interacts with Managed Service for Apache Spark control plane):
serviceAccount:${PROJECT}.svc.id.goog[${DPGKE_NAMESPACE}/agent]
spark-driver KSA (runs Spark drivers): serviceAccount:${PROJECT}.svc.id.goog[${DPGKE_NAMESPACE}/spark-driver]
spark-executor KSA (runs Spark executors): serviceAccount:${PROJECT}.svc.id.goog[${DPGKE_NAMESPACE}/spark-executor]
Use the
gcloud dataproc clusters gke create --setup-workload-identity flag
when you
create a Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster
to create the workload identity bindings required for the cluster.
Assign roles
Grant permissions to the
Managed Service for Apache Spark VM service account
to allow the spark-driver and spark-executor to access project resources,
data sources, data sinks, and any other services required by your workload.
Example:
The following command assigns roles to the
default Managed Service for Apache Spark VM service account
to allow Spark workloads running on
Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster VMs to access Cloud Storage buckets and
BigQuery data sets in the project.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding \
--role=roles/storage.objectAdmin \
--role=roles/bigquery.dataEditor \
--member=" project-number -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
"${PROJECT}"
Custom IAM configuration
Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE uses
GKE workload identity
to link the default
Managed Service for Apache Spark VM service account (data plane identity)
to the three GKE service accounts (KSAs) .
To create and use a different Google service account (GSA) to link to
the KSAs:
Create the GSA (see
Creating and managing service accounts ).
gcloud CLI example:
gcloud iam service-accounts create "dataproc-${USER}" \
--description "Used by Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE workloads."
Notes:
The example sets the GSA name as "dataproc-${USER}", but you can use a
different name.
Set environmental variables:
PROJECT= project-id \
DPGKE_GSA="dataproc-${USER}@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
DPGKE_NAMESPACE= GKE namespace
Notes:
DPGKE_GSA : The examples set and use DPGKE_GSA as the name of the variable that
contains the email address of your GSA. You can set and use a different
variable name.
DPGKE_NAMESPACE : The default
GKE namespace
is the name of your Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster.
When you create the Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster, add the following properties
for Managed Service for Apache Spark to use your GSA instead of the default GSA:
--properties "dataproc:dataproc.gke.agent.google-service-account=${DPGKE_GSA}" \
--properties "dataproc:dataproc.gke.spark.driver.google-service-account=${DPGKE_GSA}" \
--properties "dataproc:dataproc.gke.spark.executor.google-service-account=${DPGKE_GSA}" \
Run the following commands to assign necessary
Workload Identity
permissions to the service accounts:
Assign your GSA the dataproc.worker role to allow it to act as agent:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding \
--role=roles/dataproc.worker \
--member="serviceAccount:${DPGKE_GSA}" \
"${PROJECT}"
Assign the agent KSA the iam.workloadIdentityUser role to
allow it to act as your GSA:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
--role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
--member="serviceAccount:${PROJECT}.svc.id.goog[${DPGKE_NAMESPACE}/agent]" \
"${DPGKE_GSA}"
Grant the spark-driver KSA the iam.workloadIdentityUser role to
allow it to act as your GSA:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
--role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
--member="serviceAccount:${PROJECT}.svc.id.goog[${DPGKE_NAMESPACE}/spark-driver]" \
"${DPGKE_GSA}"
Grant the spark-executor KSA the iam.workloadIdentityUser role to
allow it to act as your GSA:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
--role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
--member="serviceAccount:${PROJECT}.svc.id.goog[${DPGKE_NAMESPACE}/spark-executor]" \
"${DPGKE_GSA}"
