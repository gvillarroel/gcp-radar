Apache Hadoop YARN, HDFS, Spark, and related properties
The open source components installed on Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters contain many
configuration files. For example, Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop have several XML
and plain text configuration files. You can use the
‑‑properties flag of the
gcloud dataproc clusters create
command to modify many common configuration files when creating a cluster.
Formatting
The gcloud dataproc clusters create --properties flag accepts the following
string format:
file_prefix1:property1=value1,file_prefix2:property2=value2,...
The file_prefix maps to a predefined configuration file as shown
in the table below, and the property maps to a property within the file.
The default delimiter used to separate multiple cluster properties is the comma
(,). However, if a comma is included in a property value, you must change the
delimiter by specifying a "^ delimiter ^" at the beginning of the
property list (see gcloud topic escaping for
more information).
Example using a "#" delimiter:
--properties ^#^file_prefix1:property1=part1,part2#file_prefix2:property2=value2
Examples
gcloud command
To change the spark.master setting in the
spark-defaults.conf file, add the following
gcloud dataproc clusters create --properties flag:
--properties 'spark:spark.master=spark://example.com'
You can change several properties at once, in one or more configuration files,
by using a comma separator. Each property must be specified in the full
file_prefix:property=value format. For example, to change the
spark.master setting in the spark-defaults.conf file
and the dfs.hosts setting in the hdfs-site.xml file,
use the following --properties flag when creating a cluster:
--properties 'spark:spark.master=spark://example.com,hdfs:dfs.hosts=/foo/bar/baz'
REST API
To set spark.executor.memory to 10g , insert the
following properties setting in the
SoftwareConfig
section of your
clusters.create request:
"properties": {
"spark:spark.executor.memory": "10g"
}
An easy way to see how to construct the JSON body of a
Dataproc API clusters REST request is to initiate the
equivalent gcloud command using the --log-http flag.
Here is a sample gcloud dataproc clusters create command, which sets cluster
properties with the --properties spark:spark.executor.memory=10g flag.
The stdout log shows the resulting REST request body (the properties
snippet is shown below):
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--properties=spark:spark.executor.memory=10g \
--log-http \
other args ...
Output:
...
== body start ==
{"clusterName": "my-cluster", "config": {"gceClusterConfig": ...
"masterConfig": {... "softwareConfig": {"properties": {"spark:spark.executor.memory": "10g"}},
...
== body end ==
...
Make sure to cancel the command after the JSON body
appears in the output if you do not want the command to take effect.
Console
To change the spark.master setting in the
spark-defaults.conf file:
In the Google Cloud console, open the Managed Service for Apache Spark
Create a cluster
page. Click the Customize cluster panel, then scroll to the Cluster properties
section.
Click + ADD PROPERTIES .
Select spark in the Prefix list, then add
"spark.master" in the Key field and the setting in the Value field.
Cluster vs. job properties
The Apache Hadoop YARN, HDFS, Spark, and other file-prefixed properties
are applied at the cluster level when you create a cluster. These properties
cannot be applied to a cluster after cluster creation.
However, many of these properties can also be applied to specific jobs.
When applying a property to a job, the file prefix is not used .
The following example sets Spark executor memory to 4g for a Spark job
( spark: prefix omitted).
gcloud dataproc jobs submit spark \
--region= REGION \
--properties=spark.executor.memory=4g \
other args ...
Job properties can be submitted in a file using the
gcloud dataproc jobs submit job-type --properties-file
flag (see, for example, the
--properties-file
description for an Hadoop job submission).
gcloud dataproc jobs submit JOB_TYPE \
--region= REGION \
--properties-file= PROPERTIES_FILE \
other args ...
The PROPERTIES_FILE is a set of
line-delimited key = value pairs. The property to be set is the key ,
and the value to set the property to is the value . See the
java.util.Properties
class for a detailed description of the properties file format.
The following is an example of a properties file that can be
passed to the --properties-file flag when submitting a Managed Service for Apache Spark job.

Notes
Some properties are reserved and cannot be overridden because they impact the functionality of the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster. If you try to change a reserved property, you will receive an error message when creating your cluster.
You can specify multiple changes by separating each with a comma.
The --properties flag cannot modify configuration files not shown above.
Changes to properties will be applied before the daemons on your cluster start.
If the specified property exists, it will be updated. If the specified property does not exist, it will be added to the configuration file.
Managed Service for Apache Spark service properties
The properties listed in this section are specific to Managed Service for Apache Spark.
These properties can be used to further configure the functionality of your
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
Note: These cluster properties are specified at cluster
creation. They cannot be specified or updated after cluster creation.
Formatting
The gcloud dataproc clusters create --properties flag accepts the following
string format:
property_prefix1:property1=value1,property_prefix2:property2=value2,...
The default delimiter used to separate multiple cluster properties is the comma
(,). However, if a comma is included in a property value, you must change the
delimiter by specifying "^ delimiter ^" at the beginning of the
property list (see gcloud topic escaping for
more information).
Example using a "#" delimiter:
--properties ^#^property_prefix1:property1=part1,part2#property_prefix2:property2=value2
Example:

number
Jobs are throttled if this rate is exceeded. The default rate is 1.0 QPS.
dataproc
dataproc.scheduler.max-concurrent-jobs
number
The maximum number of concurrent jobs. If this value is not set when the cluster is created, the upper limit on concurrent jobs is calculated as max((masterMemoryMb - 3584) / masterMemoryMbPerJob, 5) . masterMemoryMb is determined by the master VM's machine type. masterMemoryMbPerJob is 1024 by default, but is configurable at cluster creation with the dataproc:dataproc.scheduler.driver-size-mb cluster property.
dataproc
dataproc.scheduler.max-memory-used
number

For 2.0+ image clusters, RUN_BEFORE_SERVICES is set, and the property cannot be passed to the cluster (it cannot be changed by the user). For information on the effect of this setting, see Important considerations and guidelines—Initialization processing .
dataproc
dataproc.yarn.orphaned-app-termination.enable
true or false
Default value is true . Set to false to prevent Managed Service for Apache Spark from terminating "orphaned" YARN apps. Managed Service for Apache Spark considers a YARN app to be orphaned if the job driver that submitted the YARN app has exited. Warning: If you use Spark cluster mode ( spark.submit.deployMode=cluster ) and you set spark.yarn.submit.waitAppCompletion=false , the Spark driver exits without waiting for YARN apps to complete; in this case, set dataproc:dataproc.yarn.orphaned-app-termination.enable=false . Also set this property to false if you submit Hive jobs.
