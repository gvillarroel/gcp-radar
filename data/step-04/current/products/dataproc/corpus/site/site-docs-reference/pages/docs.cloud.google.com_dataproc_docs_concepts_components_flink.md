Managed Service for Apache Spark optional Flink component
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can activate additional components like Flink when you create a Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster using the
Optional components
feature. This page shows you how to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
with the Apache Flink
optional component activated (a Flink cluster), and then run Flink jobs on the cluster.
You can use your Flink cluster to:
Run Flink jobs using the Managed Service for Apache Spark Jobs resource
from the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or the Managed Service for Apache Spark API.
Run Flink jobs using the flink CLI
running on the Flink cluster master node.
Run Apache Beam jobs on Flink
Run Flink on a Kerberized cluster
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink cluster
You can use the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or the Managed Service for Apache Spark
API to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster that has the Flink component
activated on the cluster.
Recommendation: Use a standard 1-master VM cluster with the Flink component.
Managed Service for Apache Spark High Availability mode clusters
(with 3 master VMs) do not support
Flink high-availability mode .
Console
To create a Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink cluster using the Google Cloud console,
perform the following steps:
Open the Managed Service for Apache Spark
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster on Compute Engine page.
The Set up cluster panel is selected.
In the Versioning section, confirm or change the
Image Type and Version . The cluster image version determines the
version of the Flink component installed on the cluster.
The image version must be 1.5 or higher to activate the Flink component on the cluster
(See Supported Managed Service for Apache Spark versions
to view listings of the component versions included in each
Managed Service for Apache Spark image release).
The image version must be [TBD] or higher to run Flink jobs
through the Managed Service for Apache Spark Jobs API (see
Run Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink jobs ).
In the Components section:
Under Component Gateway , select
Enable component gateway . You must enable the
Component Gateway
to activate the Component Gateway link to the Flink History Server UI.
Enabling the Component Gateway also enables
access to the Flink Job Manager web interface
running on the Flink cluster.
Under Optional components , select
Flink and other optional
components to activate on your cluster.
Click the Customize cluster (optional) panel.
In the Cluster properties section, click Add Properties for
each optional
cluster property
to add to your cluster. You can add flink prefixed properties
to configure Flink properties in /etc/flink/conf/flink-conf.yaml that
will act as defaults for Flink applications that you run on the cluster.
Examples:
Set flink:historyserver.archive.fs.dir
to specify the Cloud Storage location to write Flink job history
files (this location will be used by the Flink History Server running
on the Flink cluster).
Set Flink task slots with flink:taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots= n .
In the Custom cluster metadata section, click Add Metadata to add
optional metadata. For example, add
flink-start-yarn-session true to run the Flink YARN daemon
( /usr/bin/flink-yarn-daemon ) in the background on the cluster master
node to start a Flink YARN session (see Flink session mode ).
If you are using Managed Service for Apache Spark image version 2.0 or earlier,
click the Manage security (optional) panel, then, under Project access ,
select Enables the cloud-platform scope for this cluster .
cloud-platform scope is enabled by default when you create a cluster
that uses Managed Service for Apache Spark image version 2.1 or later.
Click Create to create the cluster.
gcloud
To create a Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink cluster using the gcloud CLI, run the following
gcloud dataproc clusters create
command locally in a terminal window or in
Cloud Shell :
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--region = REGION \
--image-version = DATAPROC_IMAGE_VERSION \
--optional-components = FLINK \
--enable-component-gateway \
--properties = PROPERTIES
... other flags
Notes:
CLUSTER_NAME : Specify the name of the cluster.
REGION : Specify a Compute Engine region
where the cluster will be located.
DATAPROC_IMAGE_VERSION : Optionally specify the image version
to use on the cluster. The cluster image version determines the
version of the Flink component installed on the cluster.
The image version must be 1.5 or higher to activate the Flink component on the cluster
(See Supported Managed Service for Apache Spark versions
to view listings of the component versions included in each
Managed Service for Apache Spark image release).
The image version must be [TBD] or higher to run Flink jobs
through the Dataproc Jobs API (see Run Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink jobs ).
--optional-components : You must specify the FLINK component to run Flink
jobs and the Flink HistoryServer Web Service on the cluster.
--enable-component-gateway : You must enable the
Component Gateway to
activate the Component Gateway link to Flink History Server UI.
Enabling the Component Gateway also enables access to the
Flink Job Manager web interface running on the
Flink cluster.
PROPERTIES . Optionally specify one or more
cluster properties .
When creating Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters with
image versions 2.0.67 + and 2.1.15 +, you can use the --properties flag to
to configure Flink properties in /etc/flink/conf/flink-conf.yaml that will
act as defaults for Flink applications that you run on the cluster.
You can set flink:historyserver.archive.fs.dir
to specify the Cloud Storage location to write Flink job history
files (this location will be used by the Flink History Server running
on the Flink cluster).
Multiple properties example:
--properties=flink:historyserver.archive.fs.dir=gs://my-bucket/my-flink-cluster/completed-jobs,flink:taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots=2
Other flags:
You can add the optional --metadata flink-start-yarn-session=true
flag to run the Flink YARN daemon ( /usr/bin/flink-yarn-daemon )
in the background on the cluster master node to start a Flink YARN session
(see Flink session mode ).
When using 2.0 or earlier image versions, you can add the
--scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform flag to
enable access to Google Cloud APIs by your cluster
(see Scopes best practice ).
cloud-platform scope is enabled by default when you create a cluster
that uses Managed Service for Apache Spark image version 2.1 or later.

REST
This section shows how to submit a Flink job to a Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink
cluster using the Managed Service for Apache Spark
jobs.submit API.
You can add the clusterLabels field to the API request
shown below to specify one or more cluster labels. Managed Service for Apache Spark will submit the job to a cluster
that matches a specified cluster label (see the
jobs.submit
API for more information).
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Google Cloud project ID
REGION : cluster region
CLUSTER_NAME : Specify the name of the Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink cluster to submit the job to
HTTP method and URL:

Note: You can click the Equivalent REST
link at the bottom of the Managed Service for Apache Spark Google Cloud console
Submit a job page
to have the Google Cloud console construct an equivalent API REST request to use in
your code to submit a job to your cluster.
Flink jobs are listed on the
Managed Service for Apache Spark Jobs page
in the Google Cloud console.
You can click Stop or Delete from the Jobs or Job details page
in the Google Cloud console to stop or delete a job.
Run Flink jobs using the flink CLI
Instead of
running Flink jobs using the Managed Service for Apache Spark Jobs resource ,
you can run Flink jobs on the master node of your Flink cluster using the flink CLI.
Note: To use the flink cli on your cluster,
you must have activated the Flink optional component
when you created your cluster—see
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink cluster ).
The following sections describe different ways you can run a flink CLI job on
your Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink cluster.
SSH into the master node: Use the SSH
utility to open a terminal window on the cluster master VM.
Set the classpath: Initialize the Hadoop classpath from the SSH terminal window on the
Flink cluster master VM:
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$(hadoop classpath)
Note: Flink command syntax can differ according to the Flink
version installed on the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
See the Managed Service for Apache Spark Image version list
or run flink --version on your cluster to check the Flink component version installed
on your Flink cluster. Run flink command help for additional flag information.
Run Flink jobs: You can run Flink jobs in different
deployment modes on YARN : application, per-job, and session mode.
Application mode: Flink Application mode is supported by Managed Service for Apache Spark image version 2.0 and later.
This mode executes the job's main() method on the YARN Job Manager. The cluster shuts
down after the job finishes.
Job submission example:
flink run-application \
-t yarn-application \
-Djobmanager.memory.process.size=1024m \
-Dtaskmanager.memory.process.size=2048m \
-Djobmanager.heap.mb=820 \
-Dtaskmanager.heap.mb=1640 \
-Dtaskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots=2 \
-Dparallelism.default=4 \
/usr/lib/flink/examples/batch/WordCount.jar
List running jobs:
./bin/flink list -t yarn-application -Dyarn.application.id=application_XXXX_YY
Cancel a running job:
./bin/flink cancel -t yarn-application -Dyarn.application.id=application_XXXX_YY <jobId>
Per-job mode: This Flink mode executes the job's main() method on the
client side.
Job submission example:
flink run \
-m yarn-cluster \
-p 4 \
-ys 2 \
-yjm 1024m \
-ytm 2048m \
/usr/lib/flink/examples/batch/WordCount.jar
Session mode: Start a long-running Flink YARN session, then submit
one or more jobs to the session.
Start a session: You can start a Flink session in one of the
following ways:
Create a Flink cluster , adding the
--metadata flink-start-yarn-session=true flag to the
gcloud dataproc clusters create command (See
Create a Dataproc Flink cluster ).
With this flag
enabled, after the cluster is created, Managed Service for Apache Spark runs
/usr/bin/flink-yarn-daemon to start a Flink session on the cluster.
The session's YARN application ID is saved in /tmp/.yarn-properties-${USER} .
You can list the ID with the yarn application -list command.
Run the Flink
yarn-session.sh
script, which is pre-installed on the cluster master VM, with custom settings:
Example with custom settings:
/usr/lib/flink/bin/yarn-session.sh \
-s 1 \
-jm 1024m \
-tm 2048m \
-nm flink-dataproc \
--detached
Run the Flink the /usr/bin/flink-yarn-daemon wrapper script with
default settings:
. /usr/bin/flink-yarn-daemon
Submit a job to a session: Run the following command to submit a
Flink job to the session.
flink run -m <var>FLINK_MASTER_URL</var>/usr/lib/flink/examples/batch/WordCount.jar
FLINK_MASTER_URL : the URL, including host
and port, of the Flink master VM where jobs are executed.
Remove the http:// prefix from
the URL. This URL is listed in the command output when you start a
Flink session. You can run the following command to list this URL
in the Tracking-URL field:
yarn application -list -appId=<yarn-app-id> | sed 's#http://##'
```
List jobs in a session: To list Flink jobs in a session, do one of
the following:
Run flink list without arguments. The command looks for the
the session's YARN application ID in /tmp/.yarn-properties-${USER} .
Obtain the YARN application ID of the session from
/tmp/.yarn-properties-${USER} or the output of yarn application -list ,
and then run <code> flink list -yid YARN_APPLICATION_ID .
Run flink list -m FLINK_MASTER_URL .
Stop a session: To stop the session, obtain the YARN application ID
of the session from /tmp/.yarn-properties-${USER} or the output of
yarn application -list , then run either of the following commands:
echo "stop" | /usr/lib/flink/bin/yarn-session.sh -id YARN_APPLICATION_ID
yarn application -kill YARN_APPLICATION_ID
Run Apache Beam jobs on Flink
You can run Apache Beam jobs on
Managed Service for Apache Spark using the
FlinkRunner .
Note: In pre-2.18 Beam versions, a separate Beam Job Service was required
to package and submit jobs written in Python to Flink. Starting with Beam 2.18,
the Beam Job Service is no longer needed.
You can run Beam jobs on Flink in the following ways:
Java Beam jobs
Portable Beam jobs
Java Beam jobs
Package your Beam jobs into a JAR file . Supply the bundled JAR file with the dependencies needed to run the job.
The following example runs a Java Beam job from the Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster's master node.
Note: This example executes successfully with Managed Service for Apache Spark 1.5, Flink 1.9 and the
compatible Beam versions .
However, with Managed Service for Apache Spark 2.0, Flink 1.12, and Beam >=2.30, see this
JIRA issue BEAM-10430 .
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster with the
Flink component enabled.

which determines the Flink version installed on the cluster (for example,
see the Apache Flink component versions listed for the latest and previous
four 2.0.x image release versions ).
--region : a supported Managed Service for Apache Spark region .
--enable-component-gateway : enable access to the Flink Job Manager UI.
--scopes : enable access to Google Cloud APIs by your cluster
(see Scopes best practice ).
cloud-platform scope is enabled by default (you do not need to include
this flag setting) when you create a cluster
that uses Managed Service for Apache Spark image version 2.1 or later.
Use the SSH utility
to open a terminal window on the Flink cluster master node.
Start a Flink YARN session on the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster master
node.
. /usr/bin/flink-yarn-daemon
Take note of the Flink version on your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
flink --version
On your local machine, generate the canonical Beam word count example in Java .
Choose a Beam version that is compatible with the Flink version on your
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster. See the Flink Version Compatibility
table that lists Beam-Flink version compatibility.
Open the generated POM file. Check the Beam Flink runner version specified by
the tag <flink.artifact.name> . If the Beam Flink runner version in the
Flink artifact name does not match the Flink version on your cluster, update
the version number to match.

Package the word count example.
mvn package -Pflink-runner
Upload the packaged uber JAR file, word-count-beam-bundled-0.1.jar (~135 MB)
to your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster's master node. You can use
gcloud storage cp
for faster file transfers to your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster from
Cloud Storage.
On your local terminal, create a Cloud Storage bucket, and upload
the uber JAR.
gcloud storage buckets create BUCKET_NAME
gcloud storage cp target/word-count-beam-bundled-0.1.jar gs:// BUCKET_NAME /
On your Managed Service for Apache Spark's master node, download the uber JAR.
gcloud storage cp gs:// BUCKET_NAME /word-count-beam-bundled-0.1.jar .
Run the Java Beam job on the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster's master node.
flink run -c org.apache.beam.examples.WordCount word-count-beam-bundled-0.1.jar \
--runner=FlinkRunner \
--output=gs:// BUCKET_NAME /java-wordcount-out
Check that the results were written to your Cloud Storage bucket.
gcloud storage cat gs:// BUCKET_NAME /java-wordcount-out- SHARD_ID
Stop the Flink YARN session.
yarn application -list
yarn application -kill YARN_APPLICATION_ID
Portable Beam Jobs
To run Beam jobs written in Python, Go, and other supported languages, you can
use the FlinkRunner and PortableRunner as described on the Beam's
Flink Runner
page (also see Portability Framework Roadmap ).
The following example runs a portable Beam job in Python from the
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster's master node.
Note: This example executes successfully with Managed Service for Apache Spark 1.5, Flink 1.9 and the
compatible Beam versions .
However, with Managed Service for Apache Spark 2.0, Flink 1.12, and Beam >=2.30, see this
JIRA issue BEAM-10430 .
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster with both the
Flink
and Docker components enabled.

Run Flink on a Kerberized cluster
The Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink component supports
Kerberized clusters .
A valid Kerberos ticket is needed to submit and persist a Flink job or to start
a Flink cluster. By default, a Kerberos ticket remains valid for seven days.
Access the Flink Job Manager UI
The Flink Job Manager web interface is available while a Flink job or Flink
session cluster is running. To use the web interface:
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark Flink cluster .
After cluster creation, click the Component Gateway
YARN ResourceManager link on the Web Interface tab on the Cluster details page
in the Google Cloud console.
On the YARN Resource Manager UI, identify the Flink cluster application
entry. Depending on a job's completion status, an ApplicationMaster
or History link will be listed.
For a long-running streaming job, click the ApplicationManager link to
open the Flink dashboard; for a completed job, click the History link
