This document describes how to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark zero-scale cluster.
Managed Service for Apache Spark zero-scale clusters provide a cost-effective way to use
Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters. Unlike
standard Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters
that require at least two primary workers, Managed Service for Apache Spark zero-scale clusters
use only secondary workers
that can be scaled down to zero.
Managed Service for Apache Spark zero-scale clusters are ideal for use as long-running clusters
that experience idle periods, such as a cluster that hosts a Jupiter notebook.
They provide improved resource utilization through the use of zero-scale
autoscaling policies.
Characteristics and limitations
A Managed Service for Apache Spark zero-scale cluster shares similarities with a standard
cluster, but has the following unique characteristics and limitations:
Requires image version 2.2.53 or later.
Supports only secondary workers, not primary workers.
Includes services such as YARN, but doesn't support the HDFS file system.
To use Cloud Storage as the default file system, set the
core:fs.defaultFS cluster property to a Cloud Storage bucket location
( gs:// BUCKET_NAME ).
If you disable a component during cluster creation, also
disable HDFS.
Can't be converted to or from a standard cluster.
Requires an autoscaling policy for ZERO_SCALE cluster types.
Requires selecting
flexible VMs
as machine type.
Doesn't support the Oozie component.
Can't be created from the Google Cloud console.
Optional: Configure an autoscaling policy
You can configure an autoscaling policy to define secondary working scaling for
a zero-scale cluster. When doing so, note the following:
Set the cluster type to ZERO_SCALE .
Configure an autoscaling policy to the secondary worker config only.
For more information, see
Create an autoscaling policy .
Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark zero-scale cluster
Create a zero-scale cluster using the gcloud CLI or
the Dataproc API.
Note: When selecting a machine type for zero-scale clusters, use
flexible VMs .
gcloud
Run
gcloud dataproc clusters create
command locally in a terminal window or in
Cloud Shell .
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--region = REGION \
--cluster-type = zero-scale \
--autoscaling-policy = AUTOSCALING_POLICY \
--properties = core:fs.defaultFS = gs:// BUCKET_NAME \
--secondary-worker-machine-types = "type= MACHINE_TYPE1 [,type= MACHINE_TYPE2 ...][,rank= RANK ]"
...other args
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : name of the Managed Service for Apache Spark
zero-scale cluster.
REGION : an
available Compute Engine region .
AUTOSCALING_POLICY : the ID or resource URI of the
autoscaling policy.
BUCKET_NAME : name of your
Cloud Storage bucket.
MACHINE_TYPE : specific Compute Engine
machine type, such as n1-standard-4 , e2-standard-8 .
RANK : defines the priority of a list of machine
types.
REST
Create a zero-scale cluster using a Managed Service for Apache Spark REST API
cluster.create
request:
Set ClusterConfig.ClusterType
for the secondaryWorkerConfig to ZERO_SCALE .
Set the AutoscalingConfig.policyUri
with the ZERO_SCALE autoscaling policy ID.
Add the core:fs.defaultFS:gs:// BUCKET_NAME
SoftwareConfig.property .
Replace BUCKET_NAME with the name of your
Cloud Storage bucket.
