Hive metastore
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Dataproc Metastore is a fully managed, highly available,
autohealing, serverless, Apache Hive metastore (HMS) that runs on Google Cloud.
To fully manage your metadata, Dataproc Metastore maps your
data to Apache Hive
tables.
Supported Apache Hive versions
Dataproc Metastore only supports specific versions of Apache Hive.
For more information, see the Hive version policy .
How Hive handles metadata
Since Dataproc Metastore is a Hive metastore,
it's important to understand how it manages your metadata.
By default, all Hive applications can have managed internal tables or
unmanaged external tables . Meaning, the metadata that you store in a
Dataproc Metastore service can exist in both internal and external tables.
When modifying data, a Dataproc Metastore service (Hive) treats
internal and external tables differently.
Internal tables . Manages both metadata and table data.
External tables . Only manages metadata.
For example, if you delete a table definition using the DROP TABLE Hive SQL
statement:
drop table my_table
Internal tables . Dataproc Metastore deletes all metadata.
It also deletes the files associated with the table.
External tables . Dataproc Metastore only deletes the metadata.
It keeps the data associated with the table.
Hive warehouse directory
Dataproc Metastore uses the Hive warehouse directory to manage
your internal tables. The Hive warehouse directory is where your actual data is
stored.
When you use a Dataproc Metastore service, the default Hive warehouse
directory is a Cloud Storage bucket. Dataproc Metastore only
supports the use of Cloud Storage buckets for the warehouse directory.
In comparison, this is different to an on-premises HMS, where the Hive warehouse
directory usually points to a local directory.
This bucket is automatically created for you every time you create a
Dataproc Metastore service. This value can be changed by setting
a Hive Metastore configuration override on the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir
property.
Artifacts Cloud Storage buckets
The artifacts bucket stores your Dataproc Metastore artifacts,
such as exported metadata and managed internal table data.
When you create a Dataproc Metastore service, a Cloud Storage
bucket is automatically created for you in your project. By default both the
artifacts bucket and the warehouse directory point to the same bucket. You
can't change the location of the artifacts bucket, however, you can
change the location of the Hive warehouse directory.
The artifacts bucket is located at the following location:
gs:// your-artifacts-bucket /hive-warehouse .
For example, gs://gcs-your-project-name-0825d7b3-0627-4637-8fd0-cc6271d00eb4 .
Note: This bucket is created with uniform bucket-level access
and can't be changed to use fine-grained ACLs.
Access the Hive warehouse directory
After your bucket is automatically created for you, ensure that your Managed Service for Apache Spark service accounts
have permission to access the Hive warehouse directory.
To access the warehouse directory at the object level (for example, gs://mybucket/object), grant the Managed Service for Apache Spark service accounts read and write access to the storage object of the bucket, using the roles/storage.objectAdmin role. This role must be set at the bucket level or higher.
To access the warehouse directory when you use a top-level folder, (for example, gs://mybucket), grant the Managed Service for Apache Spark service accounts read and write access to the storage object of the bucket, using the roles/storage.storageAdmin role.
If the Hive warehouse directory is not in the same project as the
Dataproc Metastore, ensure that the Dataproc Metastore
service agent has permission to access the Hive warehouse directory. The service
agent for a Dataproc Metastore project is
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-metastore.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Grant the service agent read and write access to the bucket using the
roles/storage.objectAdmin role.
Find the Hive warehouse directory
Open the Dataproc Metastore page.
Click the name of your service.
The Service detail page opens.
In the configuration table, find Metastore config overrides > hive.metastore.warehouse.dir .
Find the value that starts with gs:// .
This value is the location of your Hive warehouse directory.
Change the Hive warehouse directory
To use your own Cloud Storage bucket with Dataproc Metastore,
set a Hive Metastore configuration override to point to the new bucket location.
If you change your default warehouse directory, follow these recommendations.
Don't use the Cloud Storage bucket root ( gs://mybucket ) to store
Hive tables.
Make sure your Dataproc Metastore VM service account
has permission to access the Hive warehouse directory .
For best results, use Cloud Storage buckets that are located in the
same region as your Dataproc Metastore service. Although
Dataproc Metastore allows cross-region buckets,
colocated resources perform better. For example, a europe-west1 bucket
doesn't work well with a us-central1 service. Cross-region access results in
higher latency, lack of regional failure isolation, and charges for cross-region
network bandwidth.
To change the Hive warehouse directory
Open the Dataproc Metastore page.
Click the name of your service.
The Service detail page opens.
In the configuration table, find the Metastore config overrides > hive.metastore.warehouse.dir section.
Change the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir value to the location of your new
bucket. For example, gs://my-bucket/path/to/location .
Delete your bucket
Deleting your Dataproc Metastore service doesn't automatically
delete your Cloud Storage artifacts bucket. Your bucket isn't automatically
deleted because it might contain useful post-service data. To delete your bucket,
run a Cloud Storage delete operation .
Caution: Don't delete your artifacts bucket until after you delete your
Dataproc Metastore service. If you delete your artifacts bucket first,
the service might stop working.
