Quotas management
Dataproc Metastore enforces quotas on resource usage for a variety
of reasons. For example, quotas protect the community of Google Cloud
users by preventing unforeseen spikes in usage. Quotas also help users who are
exploring Google Cloud with the
free tier
to stay within their trial.
All projects start with the same quotas, which you can change by
requesting additional quota . Some
quotas may increase automatically based on your use of a product.

Resource availability
Each quota represents a maximum number for a particular type of resource that
you can create, provided that resource is available. It's important to note that
quotas do not guarantee resource availability. Even if you have available
quota, you won't be able to create a new resource if it is not available.
For example, you might have sufficient quota to create a new regional, external
IP address in the us-central1 region, but that would not be
possible if there were no available external IP addresses in that region. Zonal
resource availability can also affect your ability to create a new resource.
Situations where resources are unavailable in an entire region are rare; however,
resources within a zone can be depleted from time to time, typically without
impact to the service level agreement (SLA) for the type of resource. For more
information, review the relevant SLA for the resource.
