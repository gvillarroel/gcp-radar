Dataproc Metastore networking overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides an overview of the networking settings you can use to set
up a Dataproc Metastore service.
Note: For Dataproc Metastore services that use the Thrift
endpoint protocol , Private Service Connect is the default
networking option. Most other networking concepts on this page also apply to
Thrift endpoint services. If you are using the gRPC endpoint protocol, the only
network configuration you need to consider in this document is
VPC Service Controls.

Notes
Default network settings
VPC subnetworks
By default, Dataproc Metastore services that use the Thrift endpoint protocol use a VPC subnetwork with Private Service Connect.
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks
You can optionally choose to use VPC networks for Dataproc Metastore services that use the Thrift endpoint protocol. This is an alternative to using VPC subnetworks with Private Service Connect. After the VPC network is created, Dataproc Metastore also automatically configures VPC Network Peering for your service.
Additional network settings
Shared VPC networks
You can optionally choose to create Dataproc Metastore
services in a Shared VPC network.
On-premise networking
You can connect to a Dataproc Metastore service with
an on-premise environment by using Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect.
VPC Service Controls
You can optionally choose to create Dataproc Metastore
services with VPC Service Controls.
Firewall rules
In non-default or private environments with an established security
footprint, you might need to create your own firewall rules.
Default networking settings
The following section describes the default network settings that
Dataproc Metastore uses for the Thrift endpoint protocol—VPC subnetworks with Private Service Connect.
VPC subnetworks
For Dataproc Metastore services that use the Thrift endpoint protocol,
Private Service Connect (PSC) is the default networking option.
PSC lets you set up a private connection to Dataproc Metastore metadata across VPC networks.
With PSC, you can create a service without VPC peering. This lets you use your own internal IP
addresses to access Dataproc Metastore, without leaving your VPC
networks or using external IP addresses.
To set up Private Service Connect when creating a service, see
Private Service Connect with Dataproc Metastore .
VPC networks
You can optionally choose to use VPC Networks for Dataproc Metastore
services that use the Thrift endpoint protocol. This is an alternative to using
VPC subnetworks with Private Service Connect. A VPC network is a virtual version
of a physical network that is implemented inside of Google's production network.
When you create a Dataproc Metastore, the service automatically
creates the VPC network for you.
If you don't change any settings when you create your service,
Dataproc Metastore uses the default VPC network.
With this setting, the VPC network that you use with your Dataproc Metastore
service can belong to the same Google Cloud project or a different project.
This setting also lets you expose your service in a single VPC network or
make your service accessible from multiple VPC networks (through the use of subnetworks ).
Dataproc Metastore requires the following per region for each
VPC network:
1 peering quota
/17 and /20 CIDR
VPC Network Peering
After the VPC network is created, Dataproc Metastore also
automatically configures VPC Network Peering for your service. VPC
provides your service with access to the Dataproc Metastore
endpoint protocols . After
you create your service, you can see its underlying VPC Network Peering on
the VPC Network Peering page in the Google Cloud
console.
VPC Network Peering is not transitive. This means that only directly peered
networks can communicate with each other. For example, consider the following
scenario:
You have the following networks, VPC network N1, N2, and N3.
VPC network N1 is paired with N2 and N3.
VPC network N2 and N3 are not directly connected.
What does this mean?
It means that through VPC Network Peering, VPC network N2 can't communicate
with VPC network N3. This impacts Dataproc Metastore connections
in the following ways:
Virtual machines that are in networks peered with your
Dataproc Metastore project network can't reach
Dataproc Metastore.
Only hosts on the VPC network can reach a Dataproc Metastore
service.
VPC Network Peering Security considerations
Traffic over VPC Network Peering is provided with a certain level
of encryption. For more information, see Google Cloud virtual network
encryption and authentication .
Creating one VPC network for each service with an internal IP
address provides better network isolation than putting all services in the
default VPC network.
IP Addresses
To connect to a network and help protect your metadata,
Dataproc Metastore services only use internal IP addresses. This
means that public IP addresses aren't exposed or are available for networking
purposes.
By using an internal IP address, Dataproc Metastore can only
connect to Virtual Machines (VMs) that exist on specified VPC
(VPC) networks or an on-premises environment.
Connections to a Dataproc Metastore service using a internal IP
address use RFC 1918 address ranges . Using these ranges means that
Connections to a Dataproc Metastore service using an internal IP
address use RFC 1918 address ranges . Using these ranges means that
Dataproc Metastore allocates a /17 range and a /20 range from
the address space for each region. For example, placing
Dataproc Metastore services in two regions requires that the
allocated IP address range contains the following:
At least two unused address blocks of size /17 .
At least two unused address blocks of size of size /20 .
If RFC 1918 address blocks aren't found, then Dataproc Metastore
finds suitable non-RFC 1918 address blocks instead. Note that the allocation of
non-RFC 1918 blocks doesn't take into account whether or not those addresses are
in use in your VPC network or on-premises.
Additional networking settings
If you require a different networking setting, you can use the following options
with your Dataproc Metastore service.
Shared VPC network
You can create Dataproc Metastore services in a
Shared VPC network . A Shared VPC lets you connect
Dataproc Metastore resources from multiple projects to a common
VPC (VPC) network.
To set up a Shared VPC when creating a service, see Create a Dataproc Metastore Service .
On-premise networking
You can connect to a Dataproc Metastore service with an on-premise
environment by using Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect
VPC Service Controls
VPC Service Controls improve your ability to mitigate the risk of data
exfiltration. With VPC Service Controls, you create perimeters around the
Dataproc Metastore service. VPC Service Controls restrict access to
resources within the perimeter from the outside. Only clients and resources
within the perimeter can interact with one another.
To use VPC Service Controls with Dataproc Metastore, see
VPC Service Controls with Dataproc Metastore . Also review
Dataproc Metastore limitations when using VPC Service Controls .
Firewall rules for Dataproc Metastore
In non-default or private environments with an established
security footprint, you might need to create your own firewall rules. If you do,
don't create a firewall rule that blocks the IP address range or
port of your Dataproc Metastore services.
When you create a Dataproc Metastore service ,
you can accept the default network for the service. The default network ensures
full internal IP networking access for your VMs.
For more general information about firewall rules, see VPC firewall rules
and Using VPC firewall rules .
Create a firewall rule for a custom network
When you use a custom network, make sure your firewall rule permits traffic
coming from and going to the Dataproc Metastore endpoint. To
explicitly allow Dataproc Metastore traffic, run the following
gcloud commands:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create dpms-allow-egress- DPMS_NETWORK - REGION --allow tcp --destination-ranges DPMS_NET_PREFIX /17 --network DPMS_NETWORK --direction OUT
gcloud compute firewall-rules create dpms-allow-ingress- DPMS_NETWORK - REGION --allow tcp,udp --source-ranges DPMS_NET_PREFIX /17 --network DPMS_NETWORK
For DPMS_NET_PREFIX , apply a /17 subnet mask to
your Dataproc Metastore service IP. You can find your
Dataproc Metastore IP address information in the
endpointUri configuration on the Service detail page.
Considerations
Networks have an implied allow egress rule that normally allows access from
your network to Dataproc Metastore. If you create deny egress
rules that override the implied allow egress rule, you should create an allow
egress rule with a higher priority to permit egress to the
Dataproc Metastore IP.
Some features such as Kerberos require Dataproc Metastore to
initiate connections to hosts in your project network. All networks have an
implied deny ingress rule
that blocks these connections and prevent the those features from working.
implied deny ingress rule
that blocks these connections and prevent those features from working.
You should create a firewall rule that allows TCP and UDP ingress on all ports
from the /17 IP block that contains the Dataproc Metastore IP.
Custom routing
Custom routes are for subnets that use privately used public IP
addresses (PUPI). Custom routes allow your VPC network to connect to a peer network.
Custom routes can only be received when your VPC network imports them and the
peer network explicitly exports them. Custom routes can be either static or
dynamic.
Sharing custom routes with peered VPC networks allow networks to "learn" routes
directly from their peered networks. This means that when a custom route
in a peered network is updated, your VPC network automatically learns and
implements the custom route without requiring any additional action from you.
For more information about custom routing, see network config .
Dataproc Metastore Networking example
In the following example, Google allocates the 10.100.0.0/17 and
10.200.0.0/20 address ranges in the customer VPC network for
Google services and uses the address ranges in a peered VPC
network.
Figure 1. Dataproc Metastore VPC network configuration
alt = "Diagram showing Dataproc Metastore VPC network configuration with Google services and customer VPC network, illustrating IP address allocation and peering.">
Figure 1. Dataproc Metastore VPC network configuration
Description of the networking example:
On the Google services side of the VPC peering, Google
creates a project for the customer. The project is isolated, meaning no
other customers share it and the customer is billed for only the resources
the customer provisions.
When creating the first Dataproc Metastore service in a
region, Dataproc Metastore allocates a /17 range and a
/20 range in the customer's network for all future
Dataproc Metastore services usage in that region and
network. Dataproc Metastore further subdivides these ranges
to create subnetworks and address ranges in the service producer project.
VM services in the customer's network can access
Dataproc Metastore service resources in any region if the
Google Cloud service supports it. Some Google Cloud services
might not support cross-region communication.
Egress costs for cross-regional traffic,
where a VM instance communicates with resources in a different region, still
apply.
Google assigns the Dataproc Metastore service the IP address
10.100.0.100 . In the customer VPC network, requests with a
destination of 10.100.0.100 are routed through the VPC
peering to the service producer's network. After reaching the service
network, the service network contains routes that direct the request to the
correct resource.
Traffic between VPC networks travels internally within
Google's network, not through the public internet.
