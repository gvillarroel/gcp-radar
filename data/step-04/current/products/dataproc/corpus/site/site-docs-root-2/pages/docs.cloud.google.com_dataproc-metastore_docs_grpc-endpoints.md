Access gRPC endpoints for Dataproc Metastore
Stay organized with collections

This page explains how to grant a Google Cloud user account or a service account
access to a Dataproc Metastore service that uses the gRPC endpoint
protocol .
About granting gRPC metadata roles
When granting an account access to your metadata, consider the following
concepts:
The level of access to provide . The level of access you grant controls
how much metadata that an account can access. For example, you can choose to
provide access to metadata stored in a specific database, a specific table,
or you can provide access to your entire project.
The principal that requires access . You use IAM principals (identities)
to run your jobs. For example, you can run Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster jobs
with user accounts or service accounts (typically the Dataproc VM service
account ).
For more information about the accounts you can use with
Dataproc Metastore, see Dataproc service
accounts .
Depending on the scope of control required, grant your principal one of the
following predefined IAM roles:
To grant full access to the metadata resources. Metadata Owner role
( roles/metastore.metadataOwner )
To grant read-write access to metadata: Metadata Editor role
( roles/metastore.metadataEditor )
To grant read access to the metadata: Metadata Viewer role
( roles/metastore.metadataViewer )
Before you begin
Enable
Dataproc Metastore
in your project.
Create a metastore service that
uses the gRPC protocol.
Understand networking
requirements specific to your
project.
gRPC and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) requirements . If you're using
gRPC, you don't have to configure a Shared VPC or set any extra network
configurations. By default, gRPC endpoints can be reached from any VPC.
However, there's one exception. If your project is using a VPC-SC service
perimeter, then gRPC endpoints can only be reached from a VPC belonging
to projects in the perimeter. For more information, see VPC Service
Controls with
Dataproc Metastore .
Required Roles
To get the permissions that
you need to grant a principal access to Dataproc Metastore metadata,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on your project, while following the principle of least privilege:
To grant full control of Dataproc Metastore resources ( roles/metastore.editor )
To grant full control of Dataproc Metastore resources, including updating IAM permissions ( roles/metastore.admin )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to grant a principal access to Dataproc Metastore metadata. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to grant a principal access to Dataproc Metastore metadata:
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy
resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
For more information about specific Dataproc Metastore roles and permissions, see Dataproc Metastore IAM overview .
Grant a principal account access to metadata
You can grant a principal account access to metadata at the project level,
service level, database level, or table level.
Grant access at the project level
To grant access to all Dataproc Metastore metadata at the project
level, you must grant a metadata role to your principal account.
gcloud CLI
To grant metadata roles to all Dataproc Metastore services in
a specified project, run the following gcloud projects
add-iam-policy-binding
command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member= PRINCIPAL \
--role= METASTORE_ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The Google Cloud project ID that you want to grant metadata access to.
PRINCIPAL : The type and email ID (email address) of the principal.
For user accounts: user:EMAIL_ID
For service accounts: serviceAccount:EMAIL_ID
For Google Groups: group:EMAIL_ID
For other principal types: Principal identifiers
METASTORE_ROLE \`: One of the following roles, depending on the scope of access that you want to grant the principal: roles/metastore.metadataViewer , roles/metastore.metadataEditor , or roles/metastore.metadataOwner`.
Grant access at the service level
To grant access to all Dataproc Metastore metadata at the service
level, you must grant a metadata role to your principal account.
gcloud CLI
To grant metadata roles at the granularity of a single
Dataproc Metastore metastore service, run the following
gcloud metastore services
add-iam-policy-binding
command:
gcloud metastore services add-iam-policy-binding SERVICE_ID \
--location= LOCATION \
--member= PRINCIPAL \
--role= METASTORE_ROLE
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ID : The ID or fully qualified identifier for your Dataproc Metastore service.
LOCATION : The region of the Dataproc Metastore that you're granting access to.
PRINCIPAL : The type and email ID (email address) of the principal account:
For user accounts: user:EMAIL_ID
For service accounts: serviceAccount:EMAIL_ID
For Google Groups: group:EMAIL_ID
For other principal types: Principal identifiers
METASTORE_ROLE : One of the following roles, depending on the scope of access that you want to grant the principal: roles/metastore.metadataViewer , roles/metastore.metadataEditor , or roles/metastore.metadataOwner .
Grant access at the database level
To grant access to all Dataproc Metastore metadata in a specific
database, you must add a metadata role to your principal account.
gcloud CLI
To grant metadata roles at the granularity of a specific database, run the
following gcloud metastore services databases
add-iam-policy-binding
command:
gcloud metastore services databases add-iam-policy-binding DATABASE_ID \
--project= PROJECT \
--location= LOCATION \
--service= SERVICE_ID \
--member= PRINCIPAL \
--role= METASTORE_ROLE
Replace the following:
DATABASE_ID : The ID of the database that you're granting metadata access to.
You get this ID from your database schema.
PROJECT : The Google Cloud project ID that contains the
Dataproc Metastore service that you're granting metadata access to.
LOCATION : The region of the Dataproc Metastore service that you're granting access to.
SERVICE_ID : The ID or fully qualified identifier for your Dataproc Metastore service.
PRINCIPAL : The type and email ID (email address) of the principal account:
For user accounts: user:EMAIL_ID
For service accounts: serviceAccount:EMAIL_ID
For Google Groups: group:EMAIL_ID
For other principal types: Principal identifiers
METASTORE_ROLE : One of the following roles, depending on the scope of access that you want to grant the principal: roles/metastore.metadataViewer , roles/metastore.metadataEditor , or roles/metastore.metadataOwner .
Grant access at the table level
To grant access to all Dataproc Metastore metadata in a specific table, you must grant a metadata role to your principal account.
gcloud CLI
To grant metadata roles at the granularity of a table, run the following gcloud metastore services databases tables add-iam-policy-binding command:
gcloud metastore services databases tables add-iam-policy-binding TABLE_ID \
--database= DATABASE_ID \
--project= PROJECT \
--location= LOCATION \
--service= SERVICE_ID \
--member= PRINCIPAL \
--role= METASTORE_ROLE
Replace the following:
TABLE_ID : The ID of the table that you're granting access to.
You get this ID from your database schema.
DATABASE_ID : The ID of the database that contains the table that you're granting metadata access to.
You get this ID from your database schema.
PROJECT : The Google Cloud project ID that contains the Dataproc Metastore service
that you're granting metadata access to.
LOCATION : The region of the Dataproc Metastore service that you're granting metadata access to.
SERVICE_ID : The ID or fully qualified identifier for your Dataproc Metastore service.
PRINCIPAL : The type and email ID (email address) of the principal account:
For user accounts: user:EMAIL_ID
For service accounts: serviceAccount:EMAIL_ID
For Google Groups: group:EMAIL_ID
METASTORE_ROLE : One of the following roles, depending on the scope of access you want to grant the principal: roles/metastore.metadataViewer , roles/metastore.metadataEditor , or roles/metastore.metadataOwner .
After you grant access to your metadata
After you grant the required roles to your service accounts, you can connect your Dataproc Metastore to a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster . Your cluster then uses the Dataproc Metastore service as its Hive Metastore.
What's next
Attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
Update and delete Dataproc Metastore
Import metadata into Dataproc Metastore
