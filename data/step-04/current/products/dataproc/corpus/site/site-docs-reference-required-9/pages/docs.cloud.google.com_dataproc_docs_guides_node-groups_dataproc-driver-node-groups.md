Managed Service for Apache Spark driver node groups
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A Managed Service for Apache Spark NodeGroup resource is a group of Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster nodes that execute an assigned role. This page describes the
driver node group , which is a group of Compute Engine VMS that are
assigned the Driver role for the purpose of running job drivers on the
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
Caution: Driver node groups are typically used on shared, long-running clusters.
But, be cautious about using this approach. A shared, long-running cluster
typically represents a single point of failure: a cluster that is unhealthy or
in an error state can block an entire data pipeline.
Instead, use ephemeral clusters ,
which exist for the lifetime of a single job.
When to use driver node groups
Use driver node groups only when you need to run many concurrent jobs
on a shared cluster.
Increase master node resources before using
driver node groups to avoid driver node group limitations .
How driver nodes help you run concurrents job
Managed Service for Apache Spark starts a job driver process on a Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster master node for each job. The driver process, in turn,
runs an application driver, such as spark-submit , as its child process.
However, the number of concurrent jobs running on the master is limited by the
resources available on master node, and since Managed Service for Apache Spark master
nodes can't be scaled, a job can fail or get throttled when master node resources
are insufficient to run a job.
Driver node groups are special node groups managed by YARN, so job concurrency
is not limited by master node resources. In clusters with a driver node group,
application drivers run on driver nodes. Each driver node can run multiple
application drivers if the node has sufficient resources.
Benefits
Using a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster with a driver node
group lets you:
Horizontally scale job driver resources to run more concurrent jobs
Scale driver resources separately from worker resources
Obtain faster scaledown on Managed Service for Apache Spark 2.0+ and later image
clusters. On these clusters, the app master runs within a Spark driver in a
driver node group (the spark.yarn.unmanagedAM.enabled is set
to true by default).
Customize driver node start-up. You can add {ROLE} == 'Driver' in an
initialization script
to have the script perform actions for a driver node group
in node selection .
Limitations
Node groups are not supported in
Managed Service for Apache Spark workflow templates .
Node group clusters cannot be stopped, restarted, or autoscaled.
The MapReduce app master runs on worker nodes. A scale down of worker nodes can
be slow if you enable graceful decommissioning .
Job concurrency is affected by the dataproc:agent.process.threads.job.max
cluster property .
For example, with three masters and this property set to the default
value of 100 , maximum cluster-level job concurrency is 300 .
Driver node group compared to Spark cluster mode
Feature
Spark cluster mode
Driver node group
Worker node scale down
Long-lived drivers run on the same worker nodes as short-lived containers,
making scale down of workers using graceful decommission slow.
Worker nodes scale down more quickly when drivers run on node groups.
Streamed driver output
Requires searching in YARN logs to find the node where the driver was scheduled.
Driver output is streamed to Cloud Storage, and is viewable
in the Google Cloud console and in the gcloud dataproc jobs wait command
output after a job completes.
Driver node group IAM permissions
The following IAM permissions are associated with the
Managed Service for Apache Spark node group related actions.
Permission
Action
dataproc.nodeGroups.create
Create Managed Service for Apache Spark node groups. If a user has
dataproc.clusters.create in the project, this permission is
granted.
dataproc.nodeGroups.get
Get the details of a Managed Service for Apache Spark node group.
dataproc.nodeGroups.update
Resize a Managed Service for Apache Spark node group.
Driver node group operations
You can use the gcloud CLI and Managed Service for Apache Spark API to create,
get, resize, delete, and submit a job to a Managed Service for Apache Spark driver node group.
Create a driver node group cluster
A driver node group is associated with one Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
You create a node group as part of
creating a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster .
You can use the gcloud CLI or Managed Service for Apache Spark REST API to
create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster with a driver node group.
Note: Managed Service for Apache Spark driver node groups are supported in clusters
created with
2.0.52
and later image versions .
gcloud
gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--driver-pool-size= SIZE \
--driver-pool-id= NODE_GROUP_ID
Required flags:
CLUSTER_NAME : The cluster name, which must be unique within a project.
The name must start with a lowercase letter, and can contain up to 51 lowercase
letters, numbers, and hyphens. It cannot end with a hyphen. The name of a
deleted cluster can be reused.
REGION : The region
where the cluster will be located.
SIZE : The number of driver nodes in the node group. The number of nodes
needed depend on job load and driver pool machine type. The number of minimum
driver group nodes is equal to total memory or vCPUs required by job drivers
divided by each driver pool's machine memory or vCPUs.
NODE_GROUP_ID : Optional and recommended. The ID must be unique
within the cluster. Use this ID to identify the driver group in future
operations, such as resizing the node group. If not specified,
Managed Service for Apache Spark generates the node group ID.
Recommended flag:
--enable-component-gateway : Add this flag to enable the
Managed Service for Apache Spark Component Gateway , which provides access to the YARN web interface.
The YARN UI Application and Scheduler pages display cluster and job status,
application queue memory, core capacity, and other metrics.
Additional flags: The following optional driver-pool flags can be added
to the gcloud dataproc clusters create command to customize the node group.
Flag
Default value
--driver-pool-id
A string identifier, generated by the service if not set by the
flag. This ID can be used to identify the node group when performing future
node pool operations, such as resizing the node group.

View job logs
To view job status and help debug job issues, you can view driver logs using
the gcloud CLI or the Google Cloud console.
gcloud
Job driver logs are streamed to the gcloud CLI output or
Google Cloud console during job execution. Driver logs persist in
a the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
staging bucket
in Cloud Storage.
Run the following gcloud CLI command to list the location of driver
logs in Cloud Storage:
gcloud dataproc jobs describe JOB_ID \
--region= REGION
The Cloud Storage location of driver logs is listed as the
driverOutputResourceUri in the command output in the following format:
driverOutputResourceUri: gs:// CLUSTER_STAGING_BUCKET /google-cloud-dataproc-metainfo/ CLUSTER_UUID /jobs/ JOB_ID
Console
To view node group cluster logs:
Enable Logging .
You can use the following Logs Explorer query
format to find logs:
resource.type="cloud_dataproc_cluster"
resource.labels.project_id=" PROJECT_ID "
resource.labels.cluster_name=" CLUSTER_NAME "
log_name="projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/ LOG_TYPE >"
Replace the following;
PROJECT_ID : Google Cloud project ID.
CLUSTER_NAME : The cluster name.
LOG_TYPE :
Yarn user logs: yarn-userlogs
Yarn resource manager logs: hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager
Yarn node manager logs: hadoop-yarn-nodemanager
Monitor metrics
Managed Service for Apache Spark node group job drivers run in a
dataproc-driverpool-driver-queue child queue under a dataproc-driverpool
partition.
Driver node group metrics
The following table lists the associated node group driver metrics,
which are collected by default for driver node groups.
Driver node group metric
Description
yarn:ResourceManager:DriverPoolsQueueMetrics:AvailableMB
The amount available memory in Mebibytes in
dataproc-driverpool-driver-queue under the
dataproc-driverpool partition.
yarn:ResourceManager:DriverPoolsQueueMetrics:PendingContainers
The number of pending (queued) containers in
dataproc-driverpool-driver-queue under the
dataproc-driverpool partition.
Child queue metrics
The following table lists the child queue metrics. The metrics are collected
by default for driver node groups, and can be enabled for collection
on any Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters.
Child queue metric
Description
yarn:ResourceManager:ChildQueueMetrics:AvailableMB
The amount of the available memory in Mebibytes in this queue under the
default partition.
yarn:ResourceManager:ChildQueueMetrics:PendingContainers
Number of pending (queued) containers in this queue under the default
partition.
yarn:ResourceManager:ChildQueueMetrics:running_0
The number of jobs with a runtime between 0 and 60 minutes
in this queue under all partitions.
yarn:ResourceManager:ChildQueueMetrics:running_60
The number of jobs with a runtime between 60 and 300 minutes
in this queue under all partitions.
yarn:ResourceManager:ChildQueueMetrics:running_300
The number of jobs with a runtime between 300 and 1440 minutes
in this queue under all partitions.
yarn:ResourceManager:ChildQueueMetrics:running_1440
The number of jobs with a runtime greater than 1440 minutes
in this queue under all partitions.
yarn:ResourceManager:ChildQueueMetrics:AppsSubmitted
Number of applications submitted to this queue under all partitions.
To view YARN ChildQueueMetrics and DriverPoolsQueueMetrics in the
Google Cloud console:
Select VM Instance → Custom resources in the
Metrics Explorer .
Debug node group job driver
This section provides driver node group conditions and errors with
recommendations to fix the condition or error.
Conditions
Condition: yarn:ResourceManager:DriverPoolsQueueMetrics:AvailableMB
is nearing 0 . This indicates that cluster driver pools queue are
running out of memory.
Recommendation: : Scale up the size of the driver pool.
Condition: yarn:ResourceManager:DriverPoolsQueueMetrics:PendingContainers
is larger than 0. This can indicate that cluster driver pools queue are running
out of memory and YARN is queuing jobs.
Recommendation: : Scale up the size of the driver pool.
Errors
Error: Cluster <var>CLUSTER_NAME</var> requires driver scheduling config to run
SPARK job because it contains a node pool with role DRIVER.
Positive values are required for all driver scheduling config values.
Recommendation: Set driver-required-memory-mb and driver-required-vcores
with positive numbers.
Error: Container exited with a non-zero exit code 137 .
Recommendation: Increase driver-required-memory-mb to job memory usage.
