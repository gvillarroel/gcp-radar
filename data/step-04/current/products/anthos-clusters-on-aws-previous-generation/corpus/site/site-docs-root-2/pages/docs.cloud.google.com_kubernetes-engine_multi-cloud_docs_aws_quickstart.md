This page provides quickstart instructions to create a cluster and node pool,
then deploy a sample application using GKE on AWS.
This page is for IT administrators and Operators who want to set up,
monitor, and manage cloud infrastructure. To learn more about common roles and
example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Quickstart your cluster with Terraform
You can
use Terraform to create a cluster and node pool .
Before creating your cluster, the Terraform scripts also prepare your AWS VPC.
You can learn more about Terraform in an AWS environment in the
Terraform cluster reference
and Terraform node pool reference .
After you create a VPC and cluster with Terraform, skip to
Deploy an application to the cluster
to deploy a sample application.
Quickstart your cluster without Terraform
If you prefer to prepare your AWS VPC and create a cluster and node pool without
Terraform, follow these instructions.
Before you begin
Before creating a cluster, you must complete the
prerequisites . In particular, you must
provide the following resources:
An AWS VPC where the cluster will run.
Up to three AWS subnets for the three control plane replicas. Each must be
in a different AWS Availability Zone.
The AWS IAM role that GKE on AWS assumes when managing your
cluster. This requires a specific set of
IAM permissions .
KMS symmetric CMK keys for at-rest encryption of cluster data (etcd)
and configuration.
The AWS IAM instance profile for each control plane replica. This requires
a specific set of IAM permissions .
An EC2 SSH key pair (optional) if you need SSH access to the EC2 instances
that run each control plane replica.
It is your responsibility to create and manage these resources, which can be
shared between all your GKE on AWS clusters. All other underlying
cluster-scoped AWS resources are managed by GKE on AWS.
Set default settings for the gcloud CLI
Use the gcloud CLI to configure default settings for your
default project and Google Cloud region.
Your project has a project ID as a unique identifier. When you create a
project, you can use the automatically generated project ID or you can create
your own.
Your Google Cloud region is a location where your clusters will be managed
from. For example, us-west1 . See
Management regions for more details.
When you configure these default settings, you don't need to include them when
you run the Google Cloud CLI. You can also specify settings or override default
settings by passing the --project and --location flags to the
Google Cloud CLI.
When you create GKE on AWS resources after configuring your default
project and location, the resources are automatically created in that project
and location.
Note: The gcloud CLI might return an error if these settings are
either not configured or not specified.
To set defaults, follow these steps:
Set the default project:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Set the default management location:
gcloud config set container_aws/location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
Replace GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION with your location,
such as us-west1 .
Note: the container_aws/location property was previously named
aws/location . If you have previously set the property aws/location , its
value is copied to container_aws/location next time you
run a command.
Select CIDR ranges for your cluster
Kubernetes requires two CIDR ranges to be provided for the cluster. These CIDR
ranges should be chosen so that they do not overlap with CIDR ranges used by
your VPC subnets. They should be large enough for the maximum expected size of
your cluster.
Pod address CIDR range : When a new Pod is created, it is allocated an IP
address from this range. Example range: 192.168.208.0/20
Service address CIDR range : When a new Service is created, it is
allocated an IP address from this range. Example range: 192.168.224.0/20
Create a cluster
Use the following command to create a cluster under GKE on AWS. For more
information about this command including its optional parameters, see the
gcloud container aws create
reference page.
gcloud container aws clusters create aws - cluster - 0 \
-- cluster - version 1.34.1 - gke .4700 \
-- aws - region AWS_REGION \
-- fleet - project FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
-- vpc - id VPC_ID \
-- subnet - ids CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_1 , CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_2 , CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_3 \
-- pod - address - cidr - blocks POD_CIDR_BLOCK \
-- service - address - cidr - blocks SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK \

-- database - encryption - kms - key - arn DB_KMS_KEY_ARN \
-- config - encryption - kms - key - arn CONFIG_KMS_KEY_ARN \
-- tags "google:gkemulticloud:cluster=aws-cluster-0"
Replace the following:
AWS_REGION : the AWS region to create the cluster in.
FLEET_PROJECT_ID : the
Fleet host project where the
cluster will be registered
VPC_ID : the ID of the AWS VPC for this cluster that
you set up in the

prerequisite step
POD_CIDR_BLOCK : the CIDR address range for your
cluster's pods
SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK : the CIDR address range for
your cluster's services
API_ROLE_ARN : the ARN of the IAM role for the
GKE Multi-Cloud service that you created in the

prerequisite step
If present, the --tags parameter applies the given AWS tag to all the
underlying AWS resources managed by GKE on AWS. This example tags your
control plane nodes with name of the cluster they belong to.
Create a node pool
Use the following command to create a node pool:
gcloud container aws node-pools create pool-0 \
--cluster aws-cluster-0 \
--node-version 1.34.1-gke.4700 \
--min-nodes 1 \
--max-nodes 5 \
--max-pods-per-node 110 \
--root-volume-size 50 \
--subnet-id NODEPOOL_SUBNET_ID \
--iam-instance-profile NODEPOOL_PROFILE \
--config-encryption-kms-key-arn CONFIG_KMS_KEY_ARN \
--ssh-ec2-key-pair EC2_KEY_PAIR \
--tags "google:gkemulticloud:cluster=aws-cluster-0"
Replace the following:
NODEPOOL_SUBNET_ID : the ID of one of the private subnets that
you created in the
Create private subnets
prerequisite step
NODEPOOL_PROFILE : the IAM instance profile name for the EC2
instances in the node pool that you chose in the
Create a node pool IAM role
prerequisite step
CONFIG_KMS_KEY_ARN : the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
the AWS KMS key to encrypt user data
EC2_KEY_PAIR (optional): the name of the EC2 key pair created
for SSH access (optional) that you created in the
Create SSH key pair
prerequisite step
Note: if your nodepool's subnet is outside of your VPC's primary CIDR block, you
must take additional steps to configure
security groups .
View your cluster status
After you create a cluster and node pool, you can view a cluster's status with
the Google Cloud CLI or the Google Cloud console. To view the cluster's status,
choose if you are using the Google Cloud CLI or Google Cloud console and follow these
steps:
gcloud
Use the gcloud container aws clusters describe command to get details
about your cluster:
gcloud container aws clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : your cluster's name
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the name of the Google Cloud
location that manages the cluster
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Google Kubernetes Engine clusters
overview page.
Go to GKE clusters
Your clusters are listed by their name and location.
Click the cluster's name. A panel with information on the cluster,
including its status and enabled features, appears.
Get authentication credentials for the cluster
After creating your cluster, you need to get authentication credentials to
interact with the cluster:
gcloud container aws clusters get-credentials aws-cluster-0
This command configures kubectl to access the cluster you created using
Connect gateway . You need at
least one node pool to use Connect gateway because it relies on the
Connect agent, which runs as a Deployment in the cluster.
Deploy an application to the cluster
Now that you have created a cluster, you can deploy a containerized application
to it. For this quickstart, you can deploy our example web application,
hello-app .
You use Kubernetes objects to create and manage your
cluster's resources. You use the Deployment object for deploying
stateless applications like web servers.
Service objects define rules
and load balancers for accessing your application from the internet.
Create the Deployment
To run hello-app in your cluster, you need to deploy the application by
running the following command:
kubectl create deployment hello-server --image=us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
This Kubernetes command,
kubectl create deployment
creates a Deployment named hello-server . The Deployment's
Pod
runs the hello-app container image.
In this command:
--image specifies a container image to deploy. In this case, the command
pulls the example image from an Artifact Registry repository,
us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app . The :1.0
indicates the specific image version to pull. If you don't specify a
version, the image tagged with latest is used.
Expose the Deployment
After deploying the application, you need to expose it to the internet so that
users can access it. You can expose your application by creating a Service, a
Kubernetes resource that exposes your application to external traffic.
To expose your application, run the following
kubectl expose
command:
kubectl expose deployment hello-server --type LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
Passing in the --type LoadBalancer flag creates an AWS load
balancer for your container. The --port flag initializes public port 80 to the
internet and the --target-port flag routes the traffic to port 8080 of the
application.
Load balancers are billed according to AWS load balancer pricing.
Inspect and view the application
Inspect the running Pods by using kubectl get pods :
kubectl get pods
You should see one hello-server Pod running on your cluster.
Inspect the hello-server Service by using kubectl get service :
kubectl get service hello-server
From this command's output, copy the Service's external IP address from the
EXTERNAL-IP column.
Note: You might need to wait several minutes before the Service's
external IP address is available. If the application's external IP is
<pending> , run kubectl get service again.
View the application from your web browser by using the external IP with the
exposed port:
http:// EXTERNAL-IP
You have just deployed a containerized web application to
GKE on AWS.
Clean up
Delete the application's Service and Deployment:
kubectl delete service hello-server
kubectl delete deployment hello-server
Delete your node pool by running
gcloud container aws node-pools delete :
gcloud container aws node-pools delete pool-0 --cluster aws-cluster-0
Delete your cluster by running
gcloud container aws clusters delete :
gcloud container aws clusters delete aws-cluster-0
