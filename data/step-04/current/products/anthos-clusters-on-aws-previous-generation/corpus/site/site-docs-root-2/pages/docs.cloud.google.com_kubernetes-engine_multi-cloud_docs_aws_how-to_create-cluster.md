This page describes how to create a GKE on AWS cluster.
You can also Create a VPC and cluster with Terraform .
This page is for Admins and architects and Operators who want to
set up, monitor, and manage cloud infrastructure. To learn more about common
roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before you begin
Before creating a cluster, you must complete the
prerequisites . In particular, you must
provide the following resources:
An AWS VPC where the cluster will run.
Up to three AWS subnets for the three control plane replicas. Each must be
in a different AWS Availability Zone.
The AWS IAM role that GKE on AWS assumes when managing your
cluster. This requires a specific set of
IAM permissions .
KMS symmetric CMK keys for at-rest encryption of cluster data (etcd)
and configuration.
The AWS IAM instance profile for each control plane replica. This requires
a specific set of IAM permissions .
An EC2 SSH key pair (optional) if you need SSH access to the EC2 instances
that run each control plane replica.
It is your responsibility to create and manage these resources, which
can be shared between all your GKE clusters. All other underlying
cluster-scoped AWS resources are managed by GKE on AWS.
Select CIDR ranges for your cluster
When you create a cluster in GKE on AWS, you need to provide
IPv4 address ranges to use for Pods and Services.
These IP ranges are specified using Classless Inter-Domain Routing
( CIDR )
notation—for example, 100.64.0.0/16 .
Note: After you create a cluster, you can't change these ranges.
Recommended ranges
We recommend the following CIDR ranges for Services and Pods:
Services: 100.64.0.0/16
Pods: 100.96.0.0/11
These ranges are large enough for you to grow your cluster without any issues.
The following sections provide more details.
Details about selecting ranges
GKE on AWS uses an overlay network for Pods and Services, so the IP ranges for
these networks don't need to be routable within the VPC. Any IP
ranges that you use must be guaranteed available. For more information, see
Dataplane V2 .
The Pod and Service IP ranges can overlap with the VPC network,
provided either doesn't include the control plane or node pool subnet
IP ranges.
The Pod and Service IP range must fall within one of the following private IP ranges:
10.0.0.0/8 , 172.16.0.0/12 , 192.168.0.0/16 — Private IP addresses (RFC 1918)
100.64.0.0/10 — Shared address space (RFC 6598)
192.0.0.0/24 — IETF protocol assignments (RFC 6890)
192.0.2.0/24 , 198.51.100.0/24 , 203.0.113.0/24 — Documentation (RFC 5737)
192.88.99.0/24 — IPv6 to IPv4 relay (deprecated) (RFC 7526)
198.18.0.0/15 — Benchmark testing (RFC 2544)
We recommend IP ranges within 100.64.0.0/10 (RFC 6598). This range
is reserved for carrier-grade NAT, which is likely not used in your
VPC.
For example, the following is a valid configuration where the Pod, Service, and
Node networks don't overlap (the VPC is using RFC 1918 private IP
addresses, whereas the Pod and Service networks are overlaid onto RFC 6598
private IPs).
VPC network: 10.0.0.0/16 , 172.16.1.0/24 , 172.16.2.0/24
Pod network: 100.65.0.0/16
Service network: 100.66.0.0/16
The following is also a valid configuration despite the Pod and Service networks
overlap with the VPC network since there is no overlap with
the control plane replicas.
VPC network: 10.0.0.0/16
Pod network: 10.0.1.0/24
Service network: 10.0.2.0/24
Control Plane Replica subnets: 10.0.3.0/24 , 10.0.4.0/24 , 10.0.5.0/24
The following configuration is invalid , because the Pod IP range
overlaps with the control plane network. This overlap might prevent
workloads from communicating with the control plane replica in the VPC network:
VPC network: 10.0.0.0/16
Pod network: 10.0.1.0/24
Service network: 10.1.0.0/24
Control Plane Replica subnets: 10.0.1.0/24 , 10.0.2.0/24 , 10.0.3.0/24
Details about the Pod address range
Kubernetes allocates addresses to
Pod
objects from the Pod address range. A cluster's Pod range is split into smaller
ranges for each node. When a Pod is scheduled on a particular node, Kubernetes
assigns a Pod IP address from the node's range.
To calculate the size of the Pod address range, you need to estimate the
number of nodes that you want in your cluster and the number of Pods that you
want to run on each node.
The following table provides size recommendations for Pod CIDR ranges based on
the number of nodes and Pods that you intend to run.

Details about the service address range
Kubernetes allocates virtual IP addresses for
Service objects — for example,
load balancers from this address range.
To calculate the size of the Service address range, you need to estimate the
number of services that you want in your cluster.
The following table provides size recommendations for Service CIDR ranges
based on the number of Services that you intend to run.

Select your Fleet host project
Fleets are a
Google Cloud concept to organize clusters into larger groups.
With fleets, you can manage multiple clusters across several clouds and apply
consistent policies across them. The GKE Multi-Cloud API automatically registers your
clusters with a Fleet when the cluster is created.
When you create a cluster, you specify a
Fleet host project
where the cluster will be managed from. Because GKE on AWS uses the
cluster name as the Fleet membership name, you must ensure that your cluster
names are unique across your Fleet.
Note: Once a cluster has been created, you cannot change its Fleet host project.
Cross-project registration
If you want to use a Fleet Host project other than the Google Cloud project
where the cluster is located, you must apply an additional IAM
policy binding to the Multi-Cloud Service Agent service account. This allows the
service account to manage Fleets with the Fleet Host Project.
To add the Service Agent to your project, run this command:
gcloud beta services identity create --service = gkemulticloud.googleapis.com \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER
Replace CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER with your Google Cloud project
number.
Assign this binding with the following command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-gkemulticloud.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/gkemulticloud.serviceAgent"
Replace the following:
FLEET_PROJECT_ID : your Fleet host project's
Google Cloud project
CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number
The Multi-Cloud Service Agent account name has the following format:
service-CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-gkemulticloud.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
You can find your service accounts on the Google Cloud console
Service account page. For more
information on how to find your project number, see
Identifying projects .
Create your cluster
Use the following command to create your cluster under GKE on AWS. For more
information about this command including its optional parameters, see the
gcloud container aws
reference page.
gcloud container aws clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
-- aws - region AWS_REGION \
-- location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
-- cluster - version CLUSTER_VERSION \
-- fleet - project FLEET_PROJECT \
-- vpc - id VPC_ID \
-- subnet - ids CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_1 , CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_2 , CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_3 \
-- pod - address - cidr - blocks POD_ADDRESS_CIDR_BLOCKS \
-- service - address - cidr - blocks SERVICE_ADDRESS_CIDR_BLOCKS \
-- role - arn API_ROLE_ARN \
-- database - encryption - kms - key - arn DB_KMS_KEY_ARN \
-- admin - users ADMIN_USERS_LIST \
-- config - encryption - kms - key - arn CONFIG_KMS_KEY_ARN \
-- iam - instance - profile CONTROL_PLANE_PROFILE \
-- tags "Name= CLUSTER_NAME -cp"
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : your chosen cluster name
AWS_REGION : the AWS region to create the cluster in
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the name of the Google Cloud
location from which this cluster will be managed, as defined in
Google Cloud management regions .
CLUSTER_VERSION : the Kubernetes version to install on
your cluster
FLEET_PROJECT : the
Fleet host project where the
cluster will be registered. If you want to manage this cluster from another
Google Cloud project, see Cross-project registration .
VPC_ID : the ID of the AWS VPC for this cluster
CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_1 , CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_2 ,
CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_3 : the subnet IDs for your cluster's
three control plane instances
POD_ADDRESS_CIDR_BLOCKS : the CIDR address range for your
cluster's pods
SERVICE_ADDRESS_CIDR_BLOCKS : the CIDR address range for
your cluster's services
API_ROLE_ARN : the ARN of the GKE Multi-Cloud API role
CONTROL_PLANE_PROFILE : the profile of the IAM instance
associated with the cluster. For details about how to update an IAM instance
profile, see
Update AWS IAM instance profile .
DB_KMS_KEY_ARN : the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
the AWS KMS key to encrypt the
cluster's secrets
CONFIG_KMS_KEY_ARN : the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
the AWS KMS key to encrypt user data
ADMIN_USERS_LIST (optional): a comma-separated list of
email addresses of the users to grant administrative privileges to - for example,
"kai@example.com,hao@example.com,kalani@example.com".
Defaults to the user creating the cluster
If present, the --tags parameter applies the given AWS tag to all the underlying
AWS resources managed by GKE on AWS. This example tags your control plane
nodes with name of the cluster they belong to.
You won't be able to SSH into these control plane nodes unless you specify
an SSH keypair with the
--ssh-ec2-key-pair
flag.
To see all supported Kubernetes versions on a given Google Cloud location, run
the following command.
gcloud container aws get-server-config --location GCP_LOCATION
Authorize Cloud Logging / Cloud Monitoring
Note: Starting with Kubernetes version 1.28, manual policy binding to
authorize the gke-system/gke-telemetry-agent service account for log and
metric collection is no longer necessary. The required permissions are now
automatically granted to this service account. You can therefore disregard
this section.
In order for GKE on AWS to create and upload system logs and metrics to
Google Cloud, it must be authorized.
To authorize the Kubernetes workload identity gke-system/gke-telemetry-agent
to write logs to Google Cloud Logging, and metrics to Google Cloud Monitoring,
run this command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog[gke-system/gke-telemetry-agent]" \
--role = roles/gkemulticloud.telemetryWriter
Replace GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID with the cluster's Google Cloud project ID.
This IAM binding grants access for all clusters in the Google Cloud project project to
upload logs and metrics. You only need to run it after creating your
first cluster for the project.
Adding this IAM binding will fail unless at least one cluster has been
created in your Google Cloud project. This is because the workload identity pool
it refers to ( GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog ) is
not provisioned until cluster creation.
