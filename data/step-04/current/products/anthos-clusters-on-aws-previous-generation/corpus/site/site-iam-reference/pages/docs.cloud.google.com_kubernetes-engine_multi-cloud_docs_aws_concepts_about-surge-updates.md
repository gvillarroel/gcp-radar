This document provides a brief overview of standard rolling updates and then
goes into detail about surge updates, which are a special kind of rolling
update. Compared to standard rolling updates, surge updates let you
configure the speed of the update. Surge updates also let you exert some
control over how disruptive updates are to your workloads.
For information about how to enable and configure surge updates for
GKE on AWS, see
Configure surge updates of node pools .
How standard rolling updates work
Some updates to a node pool, such as when you modify a node pool's annotations,
don't require the restart of nodes, and so don't elicit a rolling update. If
GKE on AWS can apply changes to a node pool without having to restart or
recreate resources, it will do so to prevent disruptions.
However, most updates to a node pool in GKE on AWS typically involve
terminating existing nodes, and launching new nodes with the updated settings.
The process of terminating existing nodes can disrupt workloads.
By default, GKE on AWS performs standard rolling updates. This method
updates nodes one at a time, and they are replaced using a
"terminate before create" approach: a node is terminated first, and then a new
updated node is launched. This minimizes disruption because only one node is
terminated and replaced at any given moment.
Here are the steps GKE on AWS takes during a standard rolling update:
Selects a node from the node pool and marks the node as unavailable to ensure
no new Pods start on it—this action is called cordoning .
Relocates the active Pods from the cordoned node to other available nodes
within the cluster. If other nodes have sufficient capacity, they
accommodate the evicted Pods. Otherwise, the cluster autoscaler, which
remains active during a standard rolling update, starts a scale up and
provisions additional nodes to ensure that there's enough capacity to
schedule the evicted Pods. For information about the measures taken to
protect workloads during this process, see
Workload protection during resizing .
Terminates the cordoned node.
Substitutes the cordoned node with a new one with the updated settings.
Conducts a health check on the newly operational node. If the node pool
fails the health check, it's marked with a DEGRADED status. This status
can be viewed by executing the gcloud container aws node-pools describe
command. When a node pool is marked as DEGRADED , new Pods might not be
scheduled on the nodes within that pool.
Continues updating, node by node, until all nodes in the pool have been
updated.
How surge updates work
In GKE on AWS, the standard rolling method updates nodes one at a time.
Surge updates, which are a form of rolling update, let you update
multiple nodes simultaneously. Surge updates are therefore faster than standard
rolling updates. However, updating several nodes simultaneously can disrupt
workloads. To mitigate this, surge updates provide options to modulate the
level of disruption to your workloads.
Another way surge updates can differ from standard rolling updates is the way
nodes are replaced. Standard rolling updates replace nodes using a "terminate
before create" strategy. Depending on the settings you choose, surge updates can
use either a "create before terminate" strategy, a "terminate before create"
strategy, or even a combination of both.
The cluster autoscaler plays a more important role in surge updates than in
standard rolling updates, which is why it figures prominently in the following
list of actions GKE on AWS takes during a surge update:
Creation of new autoscaling group : GKE on AWS provisions new nodes
with the modifications specified by the update command, and assigns these
new nodes to a new AWS autoscaling group (ASG).
Cluster autoscaler behavior : As the surge update begins, the cluster
autoscaler is activated for the new autoscaling group. The cluster
autoscaler for the original autoscaling group is deactivated. This ensures
that any scaling operations target only the new group.
Node replacement : Depending on the surge update parameters, different
strategies for node replacement are used:
"create before terminate": this strategy is activated when the
max-surge-update parameter is set to a value greater than zero. It spawns
new nodes in the new ASG before terminating the old ones in the original
ASG, aiming to minimize service disruptions.
"terminate before create": this method is triggered when the
max-surge-update parameter is set to zero and the
max-unavailable-update parameter has a value greater than zero. Nodes
from the original ASG are terminated first, followed by the creation of new
ones in the new ASG.
Node pool size adjustments : During the update, the node pool size
(that is, the sum of nodes in the old and the new ASG) might fluctuate
above or below the original count of nodes present in the node pool before
the update started. Specifically, GKE on AWS aims to maintain the total
node count within the range of ( original_count - max-unavailable-update ) to
( original_count + max-surge-update ). Eventually, the nodes in the old ASG
( original_count ) are replaced with updated nodes in the new ASG. The
cluster autoscaler might launch more nodes in the new ASG if it detects that
Pods are unable to be scheduled but it stays within the limits defined by
min-nodes and max-nodes .
An example to illustrate the process
To better understand how surge updates work, consider the following example.
Suppose you have a node pool with 5 nodes, and you run the following command:
gcloud container aws node-pools update production-node-pool
--cluster my-cluster \
--location us-west1 \
--max-surge-update 2 \
--max-unavailable-update 1 \
--node-version 1 .27.6-gke.700
In this example, max-surge-update is set to 2, max-unavailable-update is set
to 1, and you're providing a new node pool version (that is, you're changing the
GKE version that is running on the nodes in the
node pool).
Running this command triggers a surge update and GKE on AWS performs the
following actions:
Creates 2 additional nodes because the value of max-surge-update equals 2.
Assigns these 2 additional nodes to a new AWS autoscaling group.
Removes nodes from the original autoscaling group once these new nodes are
operational. GKE on AWS brings down up to 3 nodes (the
combined value of max-surge-update and max-unavailable-update ) but
ensures that at most only one node becomes unavailable at any time (due to
the max-unavailable-update value of 1).
Repeat these steps until all the nodes in the node pool have been updated
to the new GKE version.
During this update, the node pool contains between 4 to 7 operational nodes.
Things to consider before running surge updates
Before running a surge update, keep in mind the following:
Additional instances created as part of this surge step can potentially
exceed your AWS instance quota limit. If you don't have enough quota and these
additional instances can't be provisioned, the update might fail.
If max-unavailable-update is set to 0, disruptions to workloads can still
occur as Pods get evicted and rescheduled onto the newer nodes.
The maximum number of nodes that can be updated simultaneously is equal to the
sum of max-surge-update and max-unavailable-update , and is limited to 20.
Choose the right surge settings for your needs
While standard rolling updates often use a "terminate before create"
approach, surge updates introduce more flexibility. Depending on the
configuration, surge updates can follow a "create before terminate" strategy, a
"terminate before create" strategy, or a combination of both. This section
describes different configurations to help you select the best approach for your
workloads.
The following table shows three example settings, and highlights their impact
on the speed of the update and the potential disruption to your workloads:
Name
Description
Configuration
Balanced setting (default)
Balanced, slower but least disruptive.
maxSurge=1, maxUnavailable=0
Rapid updates without extra resources
Fast, no surge resources, most disruptive.
maxSurge=0, maxUnavailable=20
Rapid updates that are less disruptive
Fast, most surge resources and less disruptive.
maxSurge=20, maxUnavailable=0
Each of the settings in the table is described in the following sections.
Balanced setting (default)
The most straightforward way to use surge updates is with the default
configuration of max-surge-update=1 and max-unavailable-update=0 . This
configuration adds only 1 surge node to the node pool during the update, and
only 1 node is updated at a time, following a "create before terminate"
approach. Compared to the standard non-surge rolling update, which is equivalent
to ( max-surge-update=0 , max-unavailable-update=1 ), this method is less
disruptive, accelerates Pod restarts during updates, and is more conservative in
its progression.
It's important to note that adopting the balanced setting can lead to extra
costs because of the temporary surge node added during the update. This
additional node incurs charges while it's active, slightly raising the overall
expense compared to methods without surge nodes.
Rapid updates without extra resources
For workloads that can tolerate interruptions, a faster update approach might be
suitable. Configuring max-surge-update=0 and max-unavailable-update=20
achieves this. With this configuration, 20 nodes can be updated simultaneously
without adding any surge nodes. This update method follows a "terminate before
create" approach. Because no additional surge nodes are introduced during the
process, this method is also the most cost-effective, avoiding extra expenses
associated with temporary nodes.
Rapid updates that are less disruptive
If your workloads are sensitive to disruption, you can increase the speed of the
update with the following settings: max-surge-update=20 and
max-unavailable-update=0 . This configuration updates 20 nodes in parallel in a
"create before terminate" fashion.
However, the overall speed of the update can be constrained if you've set up
PodDisruptionBudgets (PDB)
for your workloads. This is because the PDB restricts the number of Pods that
can be drained at any given moment. Although the configurations of PDBs may
vary, if you create a PDB with maxUnavailable equal to 1 for one or
more workloads running on the node pool, then only one Pod of those workloads
can be evicted at a time, limiting the parallelism of the entire update.
Recall that initiating multiple surge nodes at the start of the update process
can lead to a temporary increase in costs, especially when compared to
configurations that don't add extra nodes or add fewer nodes during updates.
