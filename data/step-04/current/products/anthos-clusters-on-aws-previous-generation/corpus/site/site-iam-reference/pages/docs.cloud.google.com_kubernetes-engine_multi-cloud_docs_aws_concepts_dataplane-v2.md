Dataplane V2

Dataplane V2 is a data plane for GKE and GKE clusters that
is optimized for Kubernetes networking. This page gives an overview of what
Dataplane V2 does and how it works.
Introduction
Dataplane V2 provides:
A consistent user experience for networking in GKE and all
GKE cluster environments. See
Availability of Dataplane V2 for
information about the environments that support Dataplane V2.
Real-time visibility of network activity.
Simpler architecture that makes it easier to manage and troubleshoot clusters.
Dataplane V2 is based on
eBPF
and Linux nodes to flexibly and efficiently process network packets
in-kernel using Kubernetes-specific metadata.
Note: For Dataplane V2 to function correctly, GKE on AWS
deploys Pods such as anetd with elevated
RBAC permissions ,
to your nodes, such as the ability to update or patch all Pod objects on the
same node as the anetd Pod. These permissions are required for Dataplane V2 to
interpret Kubernetes objects and program network topologies in eBPF based on
your configuration.
Advantages of Dataplane V2
Security
Kubernetes
Network policy
is always on in clusters with Dataplane V2. You don't have to install and manage
third-party software add-ons such as Calico to enforce network policy.
Scalability
Dataplane V2 is designed to improve routing in large clusters. It doesn't use
kube-proxy
or iptables.
Operations
When you create a cluster with Dataplane V2, network policy logging is built in.
To see when your Pod objects allow and deny connections, configure the
logging CRD
on your cluster.
Consistency
Dataplane V2 is available and provides the same features on GKE
and on other GKE clusters environments. See
Availability of Dataplane V2
for more details.
How Dataplane V2 works
As packets arrive at a node, eBPF programs installed in the kernel decide how to
route and process the packets. Unlike packet processing with iptables, eBPF
programs can use Kubernetes-specific metadata in the packet. This lets Dataplane
V2 efficiently process network packets in the kernel and report annotated
actions back to user space for logging. The following diagram shows the path of
a packet through a node using Dataplane V2:
The Dataplane V2 controller on the node is called anetd . anetd is deployed
as a DaemonSet
to each node and is responsible for interpreting Kubernetes objects and
programming network topologies in eBPF. The anetd controller replaces the
service routing kube-proxy and the routing it would perform in the kube-system
namespace.
Dataplane V2 on GKE clusters runs in
Overlay Network mode . In
this mode, all cluster nodes form a mesh of tunnels using the
Geneve encapsulation protocol .
All container-to-container network traffic is routed through these tunnels. The
main advantage of this model is that the cluster's nodes don't need to be aware
of the underlying AWS network configuration.
What's next
Configuring Network Policies on GKE Multi-Cloud
Use network policy logging to
record when your cluster's
network policies
allow or deny connections to a Pod.
