This document describes how GKE on AWS integrates with
Cloud Logging and shows you how to access your logs.
Overview
GKE on AWS supports Cloud Logging for workloads
and for system components running on control plane and node pool nodes.
GKE on AWS includes a
Fluentbit -based logging agent. On the
control plane nodes, the logging agent runs as a system component; on the
node pool nodes, it runs as a Daemonset. Data collected by the
logging agents can be managed and deleted like any other metric and log
data, as described in
Cloud Logging
documentation.
What data is collected
GKE on AWS logs the following information:
Logs for system components on each of the control plane replica.
Logs for system services on each of the node pool nodes.
Optionally, logs for workloads
Enable workload logging
To enable workload logging, you must create a new Kubernetes cluster, version
1.22 or later.
By default, when you create a cluster GKE on AWS enables system
logging. To enable workload logging, you must create a
cluster with the --logging flag. You can choose to enable logging for system
components, workloads, or both.
For example, to enable both system and workload logging on a new cluster,
follow the instructions
to create a cluster , but
include the --logging flag in your gcloud command:
gcloud container aws clusters create CLUSTER_NAME
...
--logging=SYSTEM,WORKLOAD
or to update an existing cluster :
gcloud container aws clusters update CLUSTER_NAME
...
--logging=SYSTEM,WORKLOAD
Access your logs
There are several ways to access your GKE on AWS logs in
Cloud Logging:
Logs Explorer – You can see your logs directly from the
Logs Explorer by using the
logging filters to select the Kubernetes resources, such as
cluster, node, namespace, pod, or container logs.
Google Cloud CLI – Using the
gcloud logging read command,
select the appropriate cluster, node, pod, and container logs.
Understanding your logs
A log in Cloud Logging is a collection of
log entries , and each log entry
applies to a certain type of
logging resource .
Resource types
These are the resource types that are specific to GKE on AWS:
Resource type
Display name
k8s_control_plane_component
Control plane component logs
k8s_node
Node pool logs
k8s_container
Workload container logs
When GKE on AWS writes your cluster's logs, each log entry includes
the resource type. Understanding where logs appear makes it easier to find logs
when you need them.
Control Plane logs
Control plane logs use the k8s_control_plane_component resource type. These
include logs from system components running on the control plane replicas, such
as
kube-apiserver .
Node logs
Node logs fall under the k8s_node resource type. These include logs from
critical system component running on the worker nodes, such as
kubelet
and containerd .
System apps logs
System apps logs fall under the k8s_container resource type. These include
logs from pods installed on the worker nodes by GKE on AWS.
Specifically, containers running in the following namespaces are included:
kube-system
gke-connect
gke-system
gmp-system
asm-user-auth
cnrm-system
config-management-system
gatekeeper-system
gmp-public
istio-system
knative-serving
Find your logs in the Cloud Logging user interface
You can view your logs using the
Logs Explorer in the
Cloud Logging user interface.
Logs Explorer
Using the Query Builder, you can build a query by adding query parameters
manually. For example, if you want to explore logs for system workloads, you can
start with selecting or searching for the k8s_container resource type, and
then select the location and cluster name. You can then refine your search by
filtering the container or Pod names.
The Logs Explorer offers an additional way to build your search queries
using the Logs field explorer . It shows the count of log entries, sorted by
decreasing count, for the given log field. Using the Logs field explorer is
particularly useful for GKE on AWS logs because it provides an easy
way to select the Kubernetes values for your resources. For example, you can
select logs for a specific cluster, Namespace, Pod name, and container name.
For more information, see
Using the Logs Explorer .
Sample queries
This section includes sample queries that you can make on Logs Explorer.
Example 1: Get the logs of kube-apiserver on control plane nodes for an
AWS cluster CLUSTER_NAME :
resource.type = "k8s_control_plane_component"
resource.labels.cluster_name = "awsClusters/ CLUSTER_NAME "
resource.labels.component_name = "apiserver"
Example 2: Get the logs of kubelet on worker nodes for an AWS
cluster CLUSTER_NAME :
resource.type = "k8s_node"
resource.labels.cluster_name = "awsClusters/ CLUSTER_NAME "
log_name = "projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/kubelet"
Example 3: Get the logs of the cilium-agent container for an
AWS cluster CLUSTER_NAME :
resource.type = "k8s_container"
resource.labels.cluster_name = "awsClusters/ CLUSTER_NAME "
resource.labels.container_name = "cilium-agent"
