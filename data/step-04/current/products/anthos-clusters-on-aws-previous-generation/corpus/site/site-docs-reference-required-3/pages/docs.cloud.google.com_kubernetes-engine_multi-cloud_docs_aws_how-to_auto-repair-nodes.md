Automatic Node Repair
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The node auto repair feature continuously monitors the health of each node
in a node pool. If a node becomes unhealthy, the node auto repair feature
repairs it automatically. This feature decreases the likelihood of cluster
outages and performance degradation, and it minimizes the need for manual
maintenance of your clusters.
You can enable node auto repair when creating or updating a node pool. Note that
you enable or disable this feature on node pools rather than on individual
nodes.
Unhealthy node conditions
Node auto repair examines the health status of each node to determine if it
requires repair. A node is considered healthy if it reports a Ready status.
Otherwise, if it consecutively reports an unhealthy status for a specific
duration, repairs are initiated.
An unhealthy status can arise from a NotReady state, detected in consecutive
checks over approximately 15 minutes. Alternatively, an unhealthy status may
result from depleted boot disk space, identified over a period of approximately
30 minutes.
You can manually check your node's health signals at any time by running the
kubectl get nodes command.
Node repair strategies
Node auto repair follows certain strategies to ensure both the overall health of
the cluster and the availability of applications during the repair
process. This section describes how the node auto repair feature honors
PodDisruptionBudget configurations, respects the Pod Termination
Grace Period , and takes other measures that minimize cluster
disruption when repairing nodes.
Honor PodDisruptionBudget for 30 minutes
If a node requires repair, it isn't instantly drained and re-created. Instead,
the node auto repair feature honors PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) configurations for up to 30 minutes, after
which all the Pods on the node are deleted. (A PDB configuration defines, among
other things, the minimum number of replicas of a particular Pod that must be
available at any given time).
By honoring the PodDisruptionBudget for approximately 30 minutes, the node
auto repair feature provides a window of opportunity for Pods to be safely
rescheduled and redistributed across other healthy nodes in the cluster. This
helps maintain the desired level of application availability during the repair
process.
After the 30 minute time limit, node auto repair proceeds with the repair
process, even if it means violating the PodDisruptionBudget . Without a time
limit, the repair process could stall indefinitely if the PodDisruptionBudget
configuration prevents the evictions necessary for a repair.
Honor the Pod Termination Grace Period
The node auto repair feature also honors a Pod Termination Grace Period
of approximately 30 minutes. The Pod Termination Grace Period provides Pods with
a window of time for a graceful shutdown during termination. During the grace
period, the kubelet on a Node is responsible for executing cleanup tasks and
freeing resources associated with the Pods on that Node. The node auto repair
feature allows up to 30 minutes for the kubelet to complete
this cleanup. If the allotted 30 minutes elapse, the Node is forced to
terminate, regardless of whether the Pods have gracefully terminated.
Additional node repair strategies
Node auto repair also implements the following strategies:
If multiple nodes require repair, they are repaired one at a time to limit
cluster disruption and to protect workloads.
If you disable node auto-repair during the repair process, in-progress repairs
nonetheless continue until the repair operation succeeds or fails.
How to enable and disable automatic node repair
You can enable or disable node auto repair when creating or updating a node
pool. You enable or disable this feature on node pools rather than on individual
nodes.
Enable auto repair for a new node pool
gcloud container aws node-pools create NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--instance-type INSTANCE_TYPE \
--root-volume-size ROOT_VOLUME_SIZE \
--iam-instance-profile NODEPOOL_PROFILE \
--node-version NODE_VERSION \
--min-nodes MIN_NODES \
--max-nodes MAX_NODES \
--max-pods-per-node MAX_PODS_PER_NODE \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
--subnet-id NODEPOOL_SUBNET \
--ssh-ec2-key-pair SSH_KEY_PAIR_NAME \
--config-encryption-kms-key-arn CONFIG_KMS_KEY_ARN \
--tags "Name= CLUSTER_NAME - NODE_POOL_NAME " \
--enable-autorepair
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : a name you choose for your node pool.
To get the names of your node pools, run the command
gcloud container aws node-pools list
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster to attach the
node pool to
INSTANCE_TYPE : the desired AWS machine instance type
for this node pool— for example, m5.large
ROOT_VOLUME_SIZE : the desired size for each node's
root volume, in Gb
NODEPOOL_PROFILE : the IAM instance profile for node pool
VMs
NODE_VERSION : the Kubernetes version to install on
each node in the node pool (e.g., "1.34.1-gke.4700")
MIN_NODES : the minimum number of nodes the node pool
can contain
MAX_NODES : the maximum number of nodes the node pool
can contain
MAX_PODS_PER_NODE : the maximum number of pods that
can be created on any single node in the pool
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the name of the Google Cloud
location from which this node pool will be managed
NODEPOOL_SUBNET : the ID of the subnet the node pool
will run on.
There must not be any overlap between the cluster's Pod/Service IP
ranges and the node pool subnet network. For more information on
selecting Pod and Service IP ranges for your cluster, see
Select CIDR ranges for your cluster
If this subnet is outside of the VPC primary CIDR block, some
additional steps are needed. For more information, see
security groups .
SSH_KEY_PAIR_NAME : the name of the AWS SSH key pair
created for SSH access (optional)
CONFIG_KMS_KEY_ARN : the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
AWS KMS key that encrypts user data
Enable auto repair for an existing node pool
To enable node auto repair on an existing node pool, run the following command:
gcloud container aws node-pools update NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
--enable-autorepair
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : a unique name for your node pool —
for example, node-pool-1
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your cluster
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the Google Cloud region that
manages your cluster
Disable auto repair for an existing node pool
gcloud container aws node-pools update NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
--no-enable-autorepair
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : a unique name for your node pool —
for example, node-pool-1
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your cluster
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the Google Cloud region that
manages your cluster
Note that GKE on AWS performs graceful node auto repair disablement.
When disabling node auto repair for an existing node pool,
GKE on AWS launches an update node pool operation. The operation
waits for any existing node repairs to complete before it proceeds.
Check whether node auto repair is enabled
Run the following command to check whether or not node auto repair is enabled:
gcloud container aws node-pools describe NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : a unique name for your node pool —
for example, node-pool-1
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your cluster
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the Google Cloud region that
manages your cluster
Node repair history
You can view the history of repairs performed on a node pool by running the
following command:
gcloud container aws operations list \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
--filter = "metadata.verb=repair AND metadata.target=projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION /awsClusters/ CLUSTER_NAME /awsNodePools/ NODEPOOL_NAME
Replace the following:
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the
supported Google Cloud region
that manages your cluster — for example, us-west1
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your cluster
NODE_POOL_NAME : a unique name for your node pool —
for example, node-pool-1
Node pool health summary
Once you've enabled node auto repair, you can generate a node pool health
summary by running the following command:
gcloud container aws node-pools describe NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
A node pool healthy summary looks similar to this sample:
{
"name": "some-np-name",
"version": "some-version",
"state": "RUNNING",
...
"errors": [
{
"message": "1 node(s) is/are identified as unhealthy among 2 total node(s) in the node pool. No node is under repair."
}
],
}
The node pool health summary helps you understand the current state of the node
pool. In this example, the summary contains an error message which states that
one of the two nodes in the node pool is unhealthy. It also reports that no
nodes are currently undergoing the repair process.
