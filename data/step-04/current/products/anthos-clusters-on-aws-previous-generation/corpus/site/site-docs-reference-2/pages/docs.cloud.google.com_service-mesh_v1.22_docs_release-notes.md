Managed Cloud Service Mesh
The promotion of 1.21 to the Rapid release channel included upstream breaking changes to ExternalName and auto-sni when using the ISTIOD implementation . After considering the impact on customers, we have decided to restore the previous behavior from 1.20 and earlier for managed Cloud Service Mesh clusters using the ISTIOD implementation to match Rapid clusters using the TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR implementation. These changes are rolling out to the Rapid release channel in version 1.21.5-asm.55 or later.
If you are using an ExternalName service in the Rapid channel without a port description, the ExternalName service will not be translated into Cluster in the Envoy configuration. If the ExternalName service is a destination of VirtualService or ExternalName service is used with REGISTRY_ONLY mode, you must specify the port in the service like in 1.20 and earlier.
If you have an external service multiplexing traffic based on SNI but the corresponding DestinationRule doesn't have an explicit SNI, you must set SNI properly .

In some cases, the validation webhook will also reject unsupported API usage with an error message indicating the specific unsupported API. For more information, see Common webhook error messages . You can mitigate these issues by amending the Istio Custom Resource to remove the specified unsupported API configuration.
Isolation support to prevent cross-region overflow is now available as a preview feature for TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR implementations of Cloud Service Mesh. For more information, see Isolation for Cloud Service Mesh .

Managed Cloud Service Mesh
The following images are now rolling out for managed Cloud Service Mesh:
1.21.5-asm.42 is rolling out to the rapid release channel.
1.20.8-asm.33 is rolling out to the regular release channel.
1.19.10-asm.33 is rolling out to the stable release channel.
A behavioral change regarding user-provided credentials (private key and certificate) for TLS termination at ingress is now rolling out to the Rapid release channel. Subsequent announcements will appear for additional release channels.
The Kubernetes Secrets denoted by Gateway.servers.port.tls.credentialName will be read by each ingress gateway pod directly instead of the Control Plane. This change enhances security because the user-provided secret is read directly by the workloads instead of passing any managed component.
This change is compatible with previous behavior aside from the propagation speed of the updated secrets. Previously, updated secrets would propagate immediately. Now, updated secrets will propagate within 60 minutes. If you need immediate secret rotation, restart the gateway pods.
Each gateway pod reads Kubernetes secrets, so the number of the gateway pods becomes a scalability factor. We recommend the following maximum number of gateway pods:
If the GKE cluster is regional, 1500 or fewer pods
If the GKE cluster is zonal or using autopilot, 500 or fewer pods
If this change in behavior doesn't work for you, consider using the deployment with mounted credentials .
This change only affects clusters using Traffic Director and version 1.21.5-asm.42 or later.

For better security, Anthos Service Mesh does not support configuring the minimum workload TLS version to be lower than 1.2.
With Envoy versions 1.22 and later, the default minimal TLS version for servers changed from 1.0 to 1.2. Therefore, for Anthos Service Mesh version 1.14 and later, the default minimum TLS version for gateway servers is 1.2. If you need to configure the minimal TLS version on an Anthos Service Mesh gateway server to be lower than 1.2, then you can configure the minProtocolVersion parameter .
Anthos clusters on AWS (previous generation) will be deprecated as of April 1, 2023. Therefore, Anthos Service Mesh will not support Anthos clusters on AWS (previous generation) starting April 1, 2023. For more information, see the deprecation announcement .

Anthos clusters on-premises support Mesh CA.
New installations of Anthos Service Mesh 1.10x on Anthos clusters on VMWare and bare metal support the
Anthos Service Mesh certificate authority (Mesh CA). For details on the installation, see Installing Anthos Service Mesh on-premises .
When you install Anthos Service Mesh on-premises with Mesh CA, this enables Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging by default. Additionally, you can use Cloud Trace (which you enable separately ) as needed for troubleshooting.
Migrating to Mesh CA from Istio CA with little or no downtime.
Migrating to Anthos Service Mesh certificate authority (Mesh CA) from Istio CA (also known as Citadel) requires migrating the root of trust. Prior to Anthos Service Mesh 1.10, if you wanted to migrate from Istio on to Anthos Service Mesh with Mesh CA, you needed to schedule downtime because Anthos Service Mesh was not able to load multiple root certificates, which interrupted mutual TLS (mTLS) traffic during the migration.
With Anthos Service Mesh 1.10 and higher, you can install a new in-cluster control plane with an option that distributes the Mesh CA root of trust to all proxies. After switching to the new control plane and restarting workloads, all proxies are configured with both the Istio CA and Mesh CA root of trust. Next, you install a new in-cluster control plane that has Mesh CA enabled. As you switch workloads over to the new control plane, mTLS traffic isn't interrupt. For details, see
Migrating to Mesh CA .

The vulnerability affects Anthos Service Mesh (ASM) versions 1.4.0 to 1.4.10, 1.5.0 to 1.5.5, and 1.6.4 whether running in Anthos clusters on VMware or on GKE, potentially exposing your application to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks. This vulnerability is referenced in these publicly disclosed Istio security bulletins:
ISTIO-SECURITY-2020-007 :
CVE-2020-12603 (CVSS score 7.0, High): Envoy through 1.14.1 may consume excessive amounts of memory when proxying HTTP/2 requests or responses with many small (e.g., 1 byte) data frames.
CVE-2020-12605 (CVSS score 7.0, High): Envoy through 1.14.1 may consume excessive amounts of memory when processing HTTP/1.1 headers with long field names or requests with long URLs.
CVE-2020-8663 (CVSS score 7.0, High): Envoy version 1.14.1 or earlier may exhaust file descriptors and/or memory when accepting too many connections.
CVE-2020-12604 (CVSS score 7.0, High): Envoy through 1.14.1 is susceptible to increased memory usage in the case where an HTTP/2 client requests a large payload but does not send enough window updates to consume the entire stream and does not reset the stream. The attacker can cause data associated with many streams to be buffered forever.
Mitigation
If you use ASM 1.6.4:
* Apply the additional configuration changes specified in ISTIO-SECURITY-2020-007 to prevent Denial of Service (DOS) attacks on your mesh.
If you use ASM 1.4.0 to 1.4.10 or 1.5.0 to 1.5.5:
* Upgrade your clusters to ASM 1.4.10-asm.3 or ASM 1.5.7-asm.0 as soon as possible and apply the additional configuration changes specified in ISTIO-SECURITY-2020-007 to prevent Denial of Service (DOS) attacks on your mesh.

1.4.x & 1.5.x
1.5.5-asm.0 and 1.4.10-asm.1
Fixes the security issue, CVE-2020-11080, with the same fixes as
OSS Istio 1.5.5 . The security fixes were backported to ASM 1.4.10.
Description
A vulnerability affecting the HTTP/2 library used by Envoy has been fixed and publicly disclosed (c.f. Denial of service: Overly large SETTINGS frames ).
CVE-2020-11080 : By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker could cause the CPU to spike at 100%. This could be sent to the ingress gateway or a sidecar.
Mitigation
HTTP/2 support could be disabled on the Ingress Gateway as a temporary workaround using the following configuration. HTTP/2 support at ingress can only be disabled if you are not exposing HTTP/2 services that cannot fallback to HTTP/1.1 through ingress. Note that gRPC services cannot fallback to HTTP/1.1.

1.5.x
1.5.4-asm.2
1.5.4-asm.2 is now available.
Security fixes
1.5.4-asm.2 contains all the same security fixes that are in Anthos Service Mesh 1.4.
Beta release of the Anthos CLI
The Anthos CLI simplifies the installation of Anthos Service Mesh. You can use the Anthos CLI to:
Create a new cluster that meets the Anthos Service Mesh cluster requirements and install Anthos Service Mesh. See Installing Anthos Service Mesh on a new cluster using the Anthos CLI .
Update an existing cluster with the options that Anthos Service Mesh requires and install Anthos Service Mesh. See Installing Anthos Service Mesh on an existing cluster using the Anthos CLI .
Port change for automatic sidecar injection
If you are installing Anthos Service Mesh on a private cluster, you must add a
firewall rule to open port 15017 if you want to use automatic sidecar injection . In Anthos Service Mesh 1.4, the port used for automatic sidecar injection is 9443.
If you don't add the firewall rule and automatic sidecar injection is
enabled, you get an error when you deploy workloads. For details on adding a
firewall rule, see Adding firewall rules for specific use cases .
The alpha authentication policy is deprecated
See Updating to the beta security policies for more information.
IstioOperator API replaces IstioControlPlane API
The alpha IstioControlPlane API has been replaced by the IstioOperator API . You must use the IstioOperator API in YAML files to enable optional features when you install Anthos Service Mesh.
Enabling pod security policies no longer needed
SDS security was improved by merging Node Agent with Pilot Agent as Istio Agent and removing cross-pod UDS, which no longer requires users to deploy Kubernetes pod security policies for UDS connections.
Istio CNI plugin is supported
By default Anthos Service Mesh injects an initContainer , istio-init , in pods deployed in the mesh. The istio-init container sets up the pod network traffic redirection to/from the sidecar proxy. This requires the user or service-account deploying pods to the mesh to have sufficient Kubernetes RBAC permissions to deploy containers with the NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW capabilities. Requiring users to have elevated Kubernetes RBAC permissions is problematic for some organization's security compliance. The Istio Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin is a replacement for the istio-init container that performs the same networking functionality but without requiring users to enable elevated Kubernetes RBAC permissions.
The Istio CNI plugin performs the mesh pod traffic redirection in the Kubernetes pod lifecycle's network setup phase, thereby removing the requirement for the NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW capabilities for users deploying pods into the mesh. The Istio CNI plugin replaces the functionality provided by the istio-init container.
