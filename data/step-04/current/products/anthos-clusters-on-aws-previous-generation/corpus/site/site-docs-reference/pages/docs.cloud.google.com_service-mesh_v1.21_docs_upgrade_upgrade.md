Upgrade Cloud Service Mesh
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
This page explains how to:
Run asmcli to upgrade from Cloud Service Mesh to Cloud Service Mesh
1.21.5.
Optionally, deploy an ingress gateway.
Do a canary upgrade to migrate your workloads to the new control plane.
The Cloud Service Mesh version that you can upgrade from differs by platform.
GKE
You can upgrade directly to Cloud Service Mesh 1.21.5-asm.34 on Google Kubernetes Engine
from the following versions:
1.19+
On-premises
You can upgrade directly to Cloud Service Mesh 1.21.5-asm.34 on Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
and Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for bare metal from the following versions:
1.19+
GKE on AWS
You can upgrade directly to Cloud Service Mesh 1.21.5-asm.34 on GKE on AWS
from the following versions:
1.19+
GKE on Azure
GKE on Azure only supports Cloud Service Mesh 1.16. Upgrades from
earlier versions of Cloud Service Mesh are not supported.
Amazon EKS
If you have Cloud Service Mesh 1.7 installed on EKS, you will need to
install Cloud Service Mesh 1.21
on a new cluster. Upgrades from Cloud Service Mesh 1.7 to Cloud Service Mesh
1.21 aren't supported.
Microsoft AKS
If you have Cloud Service Mesh 1.7 installed on AKS, you will need to
install Cloud Service Mesh 1.21
on a new cluster. Upgrades from Cloud Service Mesh 1.7 to Cloud Service Mesh
1.21 aren't supported.
Before you begin
Warning: GitOps tools (including Config Sync, Argo CD, Terraform,
and Jenkins) may interfere with your Cloud Service Mesh installation,
migration, or upgrade processes. For best results, disable your GitOps tools
before you install, migrate, or upgrade Cloud Service Mesh.
Before you begin, make sure that you:
Review the prerequisites .
Review the information in
Plan the upgrade .
Install the required tools .
Download asmcli .
Grant cluster admin permissions .
Validate project and cluster .
Control plane customizations
If you customized the previous installation, you need the same customizations
when you upgrade to a new Cloud Service Mesh version or migrate from Istio. If you
customized the installation by adding the --set values flag to
istioctl install , you must add those settings to an IstioOperator YAML file,
referred to as an
overlay file . You specify the overlay
file by using the --custom_overlay option with the filename when you run the
script. The script passes the overlay file to istioctl install .
Caution: Omitting the overlay file results in a successful installation.
However, your service mesh has a different configuration than you intended
because the omitted values are reset back to the defaults when
the control plane and ingress gateway are redeployed.
Certification Authority
Changing the certificate authority (CA) during an upgrade causes downtime.
During the upgrade, mTLS traffic is interrupted until all workloads are
switched to using the new control plane with the new CA.
Upgrade Cloud Service Mesh
The following outlines how to upgrade Cloud Service Mesh:
If you are upgrading a multi-cluster mesh on GKE that uses
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, run asmcli create-mesh to configure the
multi-cluster mesh to trust
fleet workload identity
for no down time cross-cluster load balancing during the upgrade.
Run asmcli install to install Cloud Service Mesh on a single cluster. See the
following sections for command line examples. The examples contain both
required arguments and optional arguments that you might find useful. We
recommend that you always specify the output_dir argument so that
you can easily locate sample gateways and tools such as istioctl . See
the navigation bar on the right for a list of the examples.
Optionally, install or upgrade an ingress gateway . By
default, asmcli doesn't install the istio-ingressgateway . We recommend
that you deploy and manage the control plane and gateways separately. If you
need the default istio-ingressgateway installed with the in-cluster
control plane, include the --option legacy-default-ingressgateway
argument.
To complete setting up Cloud Service Mesh, you need to enable automatic sidecar
injection and
deploy or redeploy workloads .
Configure the multi-cluster mesh to trust fleet workload identity
If you are upgrading a multi-cluster mesh on GKE that
uses Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority as the certificate authority, you need to run
asmcli create-mesh before upgrading each cluster. This command configures
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority to use the fleet workload identity pool,
FLEET_PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog , as the trust domain after you
upgrade. The asmcli create-mesh command:
Registers all clusters to the same fleet.
Configures the mesh to trust the fleet workload identity.
Creates remote secrets.
You can either specify the URI for each cluster or the path to the
kubeconfig file .
Cluster URI
In the following command, replace FLEET_PROJECT_ID with
the project ID of the
fleet host project
and the cluster URI with the cluster name, zone or region, and project ID
for each cluster.
./asmcli create-mesh \
FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
PROJECT_ID_1 / CLUSTER_LOCATION_1 / CLUSTER_NAME_1 \
PROJECT_ID_2 / CLUSTER_LOCATION_2 / CLUSTER_NAME_2 # \
# Add a line for each cluster in the mesh
kubeconfig file
In the following command, replace FLEET_PROJECT_ID with
the project ID of the
fleet host project
and PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG with the path to each
kubeconfig file.
./asmcli create-mesh \
FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG_1 \
PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG_2 # \
# Add a line for each cluster in the mesh

--ca mesh_ca Use Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority as the
certificate authority. Changing certificate authorities during an
upgrade causes downtime. asmcli configures
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority to use
fleet
workload identity
--custom_overlay Specify the name of the overlay file.
Upgrade gateways
If you have gateways deployed, you will need to upgrade these as well. For a
simple upgrade follow the In-place Upgrades section in the
Install and upgrade gateways guide.
Warning: If you installed Cloud Service Mesh with any other method than asmcli , the
default ingress gateway installed will be removed unless you pass in the
--option legacy-default-ingressgateway argument.
Switch to the new control plane
Get the revision label that is on istiod .
kubectl get pod -n istio-system -L istio.io/rev
The output from the command is similar to the following.
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE REV
istiod-asm-1215-34-67998f4b55-lrzpz 1/1 Running 0 68m asm-1208-10
istiod-asm-1215-34-67998f4b55-r76kr 1/1 Running 0 68m asm-1208-10
istiod-1208-10-1-5cd96f88f6-n7tj9 1/1 Running 0 27s asm-1215-34
istiod-1208-10-1-5cd96f88f6-wm68b 1/1 Running 0 27s asm-1215-34
In the output, under the REV column, note the value of the revision
label for the new version. In this example, the value is
asm-1215-34 .
Also note the value in the revision label for the old istiod version.
You need this to delete the old version of istiod when you finish
moving workloads to the new version. In the example output, the value of
the revision label for the old version is asm-1208-10 .
Add the revision label to an application namespace and remove the
istio-injection label (if it exists). In the following command, change
REVISION to the value that matches the new revision of
istiod .
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev = REVISION istio-injection- --overwrite
If you see "istio-injection not found" in the output, you can
ignore it. That means that the namespace didn't previously have the
istio-injection label. Because auto-injection behavior is
undefined when a namespace has both the istio-injection and the
revision label, all kubectl label commands in the Cloud Service Mesh
documentation explicitly ensure that only one is set.
Restart the Pods to trigger re-injection.
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
Test your application to verify that the workloads are working correctly.
If you have workloads in other namespaces, repeat the steps to label the
namespace and restart Pods.
If you are satisfied that your application is working as expected, continue
with the steps to transition to the new version of istiod . If there's an
issue with your application, follow the steps to rollback.
Complete the transition
If you are satisfied that your application is working as expected, remove
the old control plane to complete the transition to the new version.
Change to the directory where the files from the anthos-service-mesh
GitHub repository are located.
Configure the validating webhook to use the new control plane:
kubectl apply -f asm/istio/istiod-service.yaml
Move the default tag:
<OUTPUT_DIR>/istioctl tag set default --revision <NEW REVISION NAME>
Delete the old version of istiod . The command that you use depends
on whether you are migrating from Istio or upgrading from a previous
version of Cloud Service Mesh.
Migrate
If you migrated from Istio, the old istio-ingressgateway doesn't
have a revision label:
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Upgrade
If you upgraded from a previous Cloud Service Mesh version, in the
following command, make sure that OLD_REVISION
matches the revision label for the previous version of istiod :
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod- OLD_REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Delete the validatingwebhookconfiguration resource for old revision:
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration istio-validator- OLD_REVISION -istio-system -n istio-system --ignore-not-found
Remove the old version of the IstioOperator configuration:
kubectl delete IstioOperator installed-state- OLD_REVISION -n istio-system
The expected output is similar to the following:
istiooperator.install.istio.io "installed-state- OLD_REVISION " deleted
Rollback
If you encountered an issue when testing your application with the new
version of istiod , follow these steps to rollback to the previous
version:
Relabel your namespace to enable auto-injection with the previous
version of istiod . The command that you use depends on whether you
used a revision label or istio-injection=enabled with the previous
version.
If you used a revision label for auto-injection:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev= OLD_REVISION --overwrite
If you used istio-injection=enabled :
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev- istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
Expected output:
namespace/ NAMESPACE labeled
Confirm that the revision label on the namespace matches the revision
label on the previous version of istiod :
kubectl get ns NAMESPACE --show-labels
Restart the Pods to trigger re-injection so the proxies have the previous
version:
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
Remove the new version of istiod . Make sure that the value of
REVISION in the following command is correct.
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod- REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the new version of the IstioOperator configuration.
Note: if you upgrade to Cloud Service Mesh 1.21 or later, the IstioOperator resource does not exist.
kubectl delete IstioOperator installed-state- REVISION -n istio-system
Expected output is similar to the following:
istiooperator.install.istio.io "installed-state- REVISION " deleted
If you didn't include the --disable_canonical_service flag,
asmcli enabled the Canonical Service controller. We recommend that
you leave it enabled, but if you need to disable it, see
Enabling and disabling the Canonical Service controller .
If you have gateways deployed, make sure to change the revision label
on the namespace or deployment to match the previous version of
istiod . Follow the same process outlined under the In-place Upgrages
section in the
Install and upgrade gateways
guide.
Deploying and redeploying workloads
Your installation (or upgrade) isn't complete until you enable automatic sidecar
proxy injection (auto-injection). Migrations from OSS Istio and upgrades follow
the revision-based upgrade process (referred to as "canary upgrades" in the
Istio documentation). With a revision-based upgrade, the new version of the
control plane is installed alongside the existing control plane. You then move
some of your workloads to the new version, which lets you monitor the effect of
the upgrade with a small percentage of the workloads before migrating all of the
traffic to the new version.
The script sets a revision label in the
format istio.io/rev=asm-1215-34 on istiod . To enable auto-injection,
add a matching revision label to your namespace(s). The revision label is used
by the sidecar injector webhook to associate injected sidecars with a particular
istiod revision. After adding the label, restart the Pods in the namespace for
sidecars to be injected.
Get the revision label that is on istiod and the istio-ingressgateway .
kubectl get pod -n istio-system -L istio.io/rev
The output from the command is similar to the following.
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE REV
istio-ingressgateway-65d884685d-6hrdk 1/1 Running 0 67m
istio-ingressgateway-65d884685d-94wgz 1/1 Running 0 67m

istiod-asm-1208-10-5cd96f88f6-wm68b 1/1 Running 0 27s asm-1215-34
In the output, under the REV column, note the value of the revision
label for the new version. In this example, the value is
asm-1215-34 .
Also note the value in the revision label for the old istiod version.
You need this to delete the old version of istiod when you finish
moving workloads to the new version. In the example output, the value of
the revision label for the old version is asm-1208-10 .
Switch the istio-ingressgateway to the new revision. In the following
command, change REVISION to the value that matches the
revision label of the new version.
kubectl patch service -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/selector/service.istio.io~1canonical-revision", "value": " REVISION "}]'
Expected output:
service/istio-ingressgateway patched
Add the revision label to a namespace and remove the istio-injection
label (if it exists). In the following command, change
REVISION to the value that matches the new revision of
istiod .
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev = REVISION istio-injection- --overwrite
If you see "istio-injection not found" in the output, you can
ignore it. That means that the namespace didn't previously have the
istio-injection label. Because auto-injection behavior is
undefined when a namespace has both the istio-injection and the
revision label, all kubectl label commands in the Cloud Service Mesh
documentation explicitly ensure that only one is set.
Restart the Pods to trigger re-injection.
Warning: Make sure to restart all pods in order to trigger the re-injection
of sidecars. Otherwise, the Cloud Service Mesh metric reports may become
inconsistent between the old and new proxies in the cluster.
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
Test your application to verify that the workloads are working correctly.
If you have workloads in other namespaces, repeat the steps to label the
namespace and restart Pods.
If you are satisfied that your application is working as expected, continue
with the steps to transition to the new version of istiod . If there's an
issue with your application, follow the steps to rollback.
Complete the transition
If you are satisfied that your application is working as expected, remove
the old control plane to complete the transition to the new version.
Change to the directory where the files from the anthos-service-mesh
GitHub repository are located.
Configure the validating webhook to use the new control plane.
kubectl apply -f asm/istio/istiod-service.yaml
Move the default tag.
<OUTPUT_DIR>/istioctl tag set default --revision <NEW REVISION NAME> --overwrite
Delete the old istio-ingressgateway Deployment. The command that you
run depends on whether you are migrating from Istio or upgrading
from a previous version of Cloud Service Mesh:
Migrate
If you migrated from Istio, the old istio-ingressgateway doesn't
have a revision label.
kubectl delete deploy/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
Upgrade
If you upgraded from a previous Cloud Service Mesh version, in the
following command, replace OLD_REVISION with the
revision label for the previous version of the
istio-ingressgateway .
kubectl delete deploy -l app=istio-ingressgateway,istio.io/rev= OLD_REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Delete the old version of istiod . The command that you use depends
on whether you are migrating from Istio or upgrading from a previous
version of Cloud Service Mesh.
Migrate
If you migrated from Istio, the old istiod doesn't
have a revision label.
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
If you have the older control plane, which has the OLD_REVISION revision label, click the upgrade tab and complete the deletion of the istiod control plane with OLD_REVISION .
Upgrade
If you upgraded from a previous Cloud Service Mesh version, in the
following command, make sure that OLD_REVISION
matches the revision label for the previous version of istiod .
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod- OLD_REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Delete the validatingwebhookconfiguration resource for the old revision:
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration istio-validator- OLD_REVISION -istio-system -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the old version of the IstioOperator configuration.
kubectl delete IstioOperator installed-state- OLD_REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
The expected output is similar to the following:
istiooperator.install.istio.io "installed-state- OLD_REVISION " deleted
Rollback
If you encountered an issue when testing your application with the new
version of istiod , follow these steps to rollback to the previous
version:
Relabel your namespace to enable auto-injection with the previous
version of istiod . The command that you use depends on whether you
used a revision label or istio-injection=enabled with the previous
version.
If you used a revision label for auto-injection:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev= OLD_REVISION --overwrite
If you used istio-injection=enabled :
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev- istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
Expected output:
namespace/ NAMESPACE labeled
Confirm that the revision label on the namespace matches the revision
label on the previous version of istiod :
kubectl get ns NAMESPACE --show-labels
Restart the Pods to trigger re-injection so the proxies have the previous
version:
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
Remove the new istio-ingressgateway Deployment. Make sure that the
value of REVISION in the following command is
correct.
kubectl delete deploy -l app=istio-ingressgateway,istio.io/rev= REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the new version of istiod . Make sure that the value of
REVISION in the following command is correct.
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod- REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the new version of the IstioOperator configuration.
Note: if you upgrade to Cloud Service Mesh 1.21 or later, the IstioOperator resource does not exist.
kubectl delete IstioOperator installed-state- REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Expected output is similar to the following:
istiooperator.install.istio.io "installed-state- REVISION " deleted
If you didn't include the --disable_canonical_service flag,
the script enabled the Canonical Service controller. We recommend that
you leave it enabled, but if you need to disable it, see
Enabling and disabling the Canonical Service controller .
