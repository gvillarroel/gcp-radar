Ruby Runtime Environment
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Ruby runtime allows you to run your app in App Engine in a
sandbox environment. This document explains the details of the Ruby
runtime environment, including what headers are provided to your code and other
information to successfully deploy your application on App Engine.
Specify the Ruby runtime for App Engine in the standard
environment in the
app.yaml file:
runtime : ruby VERSION
Where VERSION is the Ruby MAJOR and MINOR version numbers. For example,
to use the latest Ruby version, Ruby 4.0, specify
40 .
For other supported Ruby versions, and the corresponding Ubuntu version for your
Ruby version, see the Runtime support schedule .
Ruby version
The latest supported Ruby version is 4.0. The Ruby runtime uses the latest stable release of the version
that is specified in your app.yaml file. App Engine automatically
updates to new patch release versions, but it will not automatically update the
minor version.
For example, your application might be deployed at Ruby 2.6.0 and
automatically updated to version 2.6.1 at a later deployment, but it will not
be automatically updated to Ruby 2.7.
Dependencies
For more information on declaring and managing dependencies, see Specifying dependencies .
Application startup
The runtime starts your application using the entrypoint defined in
app.yaml . The entrypoint should start a process that
responds to HTTP requests on the port defined by the environment variable PORT .
For example:
entrypoint : bundle exec rails server - p $PORT
Most web applications use a Rack -supported web server
such as Puma , Unicorn or
Thin .
You must add the server as a dependency in your application's Gemfile
configuration file. The runtime will install all dependencies before your
entrypoint is called.
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "rack"
gem "puma"
An example entrypoint using puma for a Rails application:
entrypoint : bundle exec rails server Puma - p $PORT
An example entrypoint using puma for any Rack application:
entrypoint : bundle exec rackup - s Puma - p $PORT
For applications that can handle requests without a Rack server, you can just execute a ruby script:
entrypoint : bundle exec ruby app . rb
Note: The entrypoint command will be executed by
bash's exec function .
Shell variables such as $PORT will be replaced normally, but shell syntax such
as if , for and while embedded in the entrypoint command will not
function.
Environment variables
The following environment variables are set by the runtime:
Environment variable
Description
GAE_APPLICATION
The ID of your App Engine application.
This ID is prefixed with ' region code ~'
such as 'e~' for applications deployed in Europe.
GAE_DEPLOYMENT_ID
The ID of the current deployment.
GAE_ENV
The App Engine environment. Set to standard .
GAE_INSTANCE
The ID of the instance on which your service is currently running.
GAE_MEMORY_MB
The amount of memory available to the application process, in MB.
GAE_RUNTIME
The runtime specified in your app.yaml file.
GAE_SERVICE
The service name specified in your app.yaml file. If no service name is specified, it is set to default .
GAE_VERSION
The current version label of your service.
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
The Google Cloud project ID associated with your application.
PORT
The port that receives HTTP requests.
NODE_ENV (Only available in the Node.js runtime)
Set to production when your service is deployed.
You can
define additional environment variables in your app.yaml file ,
but the above values cannot be overridden, except for NODE_ENV .
HTTPS and forwarding proxies
App Engine terminates HTTPS connections at the load balancer and
forwards requests to your application. Some applications need to determine
the original request IP and protocol. The user's IP address is available in
the standard X-Forwarded-For header. Applications that require this
information should configure their web framework to trust the proxy.
Filesystem
The runtime includes a writable /tmp directory, with all other directories
having read-only access. Writing to /tmp takes up system memory. For more
information, see the TempDir
and TempFile
documentation.
Metadata server
Each instance of your application can use the App Engine metadata server
to query information about the instance and your project.
Note: Custom metadata is not supported in the standard environment.
You can access the metadata server through the following endpoints:
http://metadata
http://metadata.google.internal
Requests sent to the metadata server must include the request header
Metadata-Flavor: Google . This header indicates that the request was sent with
the intention of retrieving metadata values.
The following table lists the endpoints where you can make HTTP requests for
specific metadata:
Metadata endpoint
Description
/computeMetadata/v1/project/numeric-project-id
The project number assigned to your project.
/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id
The project ID assigned to your project.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/region
The region the instance is running in.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/aliases
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/email
The default service account email assigned to your project.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/
Lists all the default service accounts for your project.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/scopes
Lists all the supported scopes for the default service accounts.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token
Returns the auth token that can be used to authenticate your application to other Google Cloud APIs.
For example, to retrieve your project ID, send a request to
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id .
