SOAR
A playbook is built on triggers, actions, and flows, working together to automate incident response and other security operations tasks. When a trigger initiates a playbook, it proceeds through a series of defined actions to achieve a specific resolution.
The execution of a playbook follows an organized progression:
Trigger (yellow box): This is the mandatory first component that initiates the playbook. It defines the conditions or events that cause the playbook to run.
Actions (blue box): After the trigger, the playbook moves to a set of defined actions it must perform. These are the specific tasks or operations the playbook executes, such as enriching data, notifying users, or isolating a compromised host.
Flow (purple box): The final component involves determining the flow of the playbook, typically using `if-then-else` conditions. This method gives the playbook the ability to make decisions based on the outcomes of previous actions and branch into different paths to reach a final resolution.
