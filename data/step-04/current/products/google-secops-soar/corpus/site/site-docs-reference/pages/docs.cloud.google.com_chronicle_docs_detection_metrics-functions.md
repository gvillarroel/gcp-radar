Use metrics functions for Risk Analytics rules
Use metrics functions for Risk Analytics rules
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
This document describes the major elements of YARA-L 2.0 syntax features, specifically designed for risk analytics. It provides a detailed overview of how to use specialized metric functions to aggregate large amounts of historical data, enabling more sophisticated detection and risk scoring. For more information about YARA-L, see YARA-L 2.0 overview .
Note: Some metric functions event types have equivalent event types. For a listing
of equivalent event types, see Metadata.EventType .
Google Security Operations supports a number of metric functions, which can aggregate
large amounts of historical data. All rules that use the metric function are automatically categorized as multi-event rules , even if they don't have a match section and use only one event variable. This means that they count against multi-event rule quota.
Note: You can only use the metric function in the outcome section. All example
function calls assume usage in a multi-event rule.
Metric function parameters
You can use the metric functions for rules that perform entity behavioral
analytics.
Example: Calculate maximum daily outbound bytes per IP
The following example demonstrates a rule that calculates the maximum number of daily bytes sent by a specific IP address over the past month. In this instance, the IP address is represented by the placeholder variable ( $ip ). Learn more about placeholder variables .
$max_bytes_per_day = max(metrics.network_bytes_outbound(
period:1d, window:30d,
metric:value_sum,
agg:max,
principal.asset.ip:$ip
))
Due to the large number of arguments used in these functions, the example uses named
parameters, which can be specified in any order. The parameters are as follows:
Period
The length of time over which individual log events are combined into a single
observation. The only values allowed are 1h and 1d .
Note: An hourly metric (a metric with a period of 1h ) can only be used in rules
that also use a daily metric (a metric with a period of 1d ).
Window
The length of time over which individual observations are aggregated into a
single value, such as the average and the maximum. The allowed values for
window are based on the period of the metric. The valid mapping is as follows:
period:1h : window:today
period:1d : window:30d
Example: Identify peak daily failed authentications for a specific user
Example: Identifying peak daily failed authentications for a specific user
The following example demonstrates a rule that identifies the greatest number of failed authentication attempts ( max(metrics.auth_attempts_fail ) recorded for a specific user ( alice ) within a single day ( 1d ), calculated over a 30-day ( 30d ) lookback period:
$user = "alice"
$max_fail = max(metrics.auth_attempts_fail(
period:1d, window:30d,
metric:event_count_sum,
agg:max,
target.user.userid:$user
))
Example: Detect first-seen user logins using hourly and daily metrics
The following example demonstrates how to combine hourly and daily metric functions to identify "first-seen" behaviors. This rule determines if a user is logging into a specific application for the first time by checking both the current day's hourly increments and a broader 30-day historical window.
events:
$e.metadata.event_type = "USER_LOGIN"
$e.security_result.action = "ALLOW"
$userid = $e.target.user.userid
$app = $e.target.application
match:
// find events from now - 4h ago, which is the recommended look-back period
$userid, $app over 4h
outcome:
// check hourly analytics until daily analytics are available
$first_seen_today = max(metrics.auth_attempts_success(
period:1h, window:today, metric:first_seen, agg:max,
target.user.userid:$userid, target.application:$app))
$first_seen_monthly = max(metrics.auth_attempts_success(
period:1d, window:30d, metric:first_seen, agg:max,
target.user.userid:$userid, target.application:$app))
condition:
$e and ($first_seen_today = 0) and ($first_seen_monthly = 0)
Metric
Within each period, each observation has a number of metrics associated with it.
One of these must be selected for aggregation over the entire window. Five
metric types are supported:
event_count_sum : Number of unique log events within each period.
first_seen : First seen timestamp of a matching log event within each
period.
last_seen : Last seen timestamp of a matching log event within each
period.
value_sum : Represents the sum of the number of bytes in all the log
events combined within the period. You can only use this value for a metric
function with bytes in its name.
num_unique_filter_values : Metric that is not pre-computed by
Google SecOps but can be computed during rule execution. For details, see Count unique metrics .
Agg
Which aggregation is applied to the metric. Aggregations are applied over the
entire window (e.g. the highest daily value over the past 30 days). The allowed
values are:
avg —Average value per period. This is a statistical mean, which does not
include values of zero.
max —Greatest value per period.
min —Smallest value per period.
num_metric_periods —Number of periods within the time window that had a
non-zero metric value.
stddev —Standard deviation of the value per period. This is a statistical
standard deviation which does not include zero values.
sum —Sum of each value per period, over the entire window.
For example, the following rule tells you the average number of failed
authentication attempts seen for a specific user (Alice) in any given day over
the last 30 days:
$user = "alice"
$avg_fail = max(metrics.auth_attempts_fail(
period:1d, window:30d,
metric:event_count_sum,
agg:avg,
target.user.userid:$user
))
The following rule tells you how many successful authentications a specific user
had over the last 30 days:
$total_success = max(metrics.auth_attempts_success(
period:1d, window:30d,
metric:event_count_sum,
agg:sum,
target.user.userid:$user
))
The following rule tells you whether a specific user successfully logged in at
least once over the last 30 days:
$days_success = max(metrics.auth_attempts_success(
period:1d, window:30d,
metric:event_count_sum,
agg:num_metric_periods,
target.user.userid:$user
))
The following rule tells you the first or last time a specific user logged in
successfully:
$first_seen = max(metrics.auth_attempts_success(
period:1d, window:30d,
metric:first_seen,
agg:min,
target.user.userid:$user
))
$last_seen = max(metrics.auth_attempts_success(
period:1d, window:30d,
metric:last_seen,
agg:max,
target.user.userid:$user
))
The following rule tells you the maximum number of bytes sent by a user in any
given day over the last 30 days:
$max_daily_bytes = max(metrics.network_bytes_outbound(
period:1d, window:30d,
metric:value_sum,
agg:max,
target.user.userid:$user
))
Filter
Filters allow filtering a metric before aggregation by a value in the
pre-computed metric (see values in Metric ). Filters can be any valid
events expression (a single line in the event section) which does not contain
any event fields or placeholders. The only variables that can be included in
this condition are metric types.
The following rule includes only metrics where value_sum > 10 AND
event_count_sum > 2 :
$max_bytes_per_day = max(metrics.network_bytes_outbound(
period:1d, window:30d,
metric:value_sum,
agg:max,
principal.asset.ip:$ip
filter:value_sum > 10 AND event_count_sum > 2
))
Valid examples of filters
filter:value_sum > 10 AND event_count_sum != 5
filter:event_count_sum = 100 OR event_count_sum > 1000
filter:timestamp.get_day_of_week(first_seen) = 3
Invalid examples of filters
// No placeholders in filter expressions.
filter:value_sum > $ph
// No event fields in filter expressions.
filter:event_count_sum + $e.field > 10
// No event fields in filter expressions.
filter:timestamp.subtract(first_seen, $e.metadata.timestamp)
UDM fields
A metric is filtered by 1, 2, or 3 UDM fields, depending on the function. For
more information, see Functions .
The following types of UDM fields are used for metric functions:
Dimensions—(Required) Different combinations are listed in this
documentation. You cannot join a metric with a default value ( "" for
string and 0 for int).
Namespaces—(Optional) You can only use namespaces for entities that
you specify in dimensions. For example, if you use principal.asset.hostname
filter , you can use a principal.namespace filter as well. If you don't
include a namespace filter, the data across all namespaces is aggregated
together. You can use a default value as a namespace filter.
Window calculations
Google Security Operations calculates metrics using either a daily or hourly metric
window.
Daily windows
All daily windows, such as 30d , are determined the same way.
Google Security Operations uses the latest available metrics data that has been
generated that does not overlap with the rule time range. Calculation of the
daily metrics can take up to 6 hours to complete and doesn't start until the end
of the day in UTC. Metric data for the day before will be available at or
before 6:00 UTC each day.
For example, for a rule that is running over event data from 2023-10-31 4:00 UTC
to 2023-10-31 7:00 UTC, the daily metrics for 2023-10-31 will likely have been
generated, so the metric calculation will use the data from 2023-10-01 to
2023-10-30 (inclusive). Whereas for a rule that is running over event data from
2023-10-31 1:00 UTC to 2023-10-31 3:00 UTC, the daily metrics for 2023-10-30
will likely not have been generated, so the metric calculation will use the data
from 2023-09-30 to 2023-10-29 (inclusive).
Hourly today window
The hourly metric window is calculated differently from the window for
daily metrics. The hourly metric window of today is not a static size like the
30d window for daily metrics. The hourly metric window today fills in as
much data as possible between the end of the daily window and the start of the
rule time window.
For example, for a rule that is running over event data from 2023-10-31 4:00:00
UTC to 2023-10-31 7:00:00 UTC, the daily metric calculation will use the data
from 2023-10-01 to 2023-10-30 (inclusive) and the hourly metric window will use
data from 2023-10-31 00:00:00 UTC to 2023-10-31 4:00:00 UTC.
Count unique metrics
There is a special type of metric num_unique_filter_values that is not
pre-computed by Google SecOps
and is instead computed during a rule execution. This is done by aggregating
over an existing dimension in a pre-computed metric. For example, the metric
daily total count of distinct countries that a user attempted to authenticate
in can be derived from the pre-computed auth_attempts_total metric on the
dimensions target.user.userid and
principal.ip_geo_artifact.location.country_or_region by performing a count
unique aggregation over the latter dimension.
The following example rule counts unique metrics:
$outcome_variable = max(metrics.auth_attempts_total(
period: 1d,
window: 30d,
// This metric type indicates any filter with a wildcard value should be
// aggregated over each day to produce a new metric on-the-fly.
metric: num_unique_filter_values,
agg: max,
target.user.userid: $userid,
// Filter whose value should be counted over each day to produce the
// num_unique_filter_values metric.
principal.ip_geo_artifact.location.country_or_region: *
))
Note: Computing unique the metric count can only be aggregated over a single filter dimension. This is indicated by using the wildcard token * as the filter value.

Limitations with metrics
When creating YARA-L rules with metrics, be aware of the following limitations:
You cannot join a metric with a default value ( "" for string and 0 for
int).
Default values:
If there is no metric data that corresponds to an event, the returned
value from the metric function is 0.
If there is an event in the detection which has no metric data, using
min to aggregate over the function might return 0.
To check whether there is data for an event, you can use the metric
num_metric_periods aggregation on that same event with the same filters.
Metric functions can only be used in the outcome section.
Since metric functions are only used in the outcome section, they must be
aggregated just like any other value in rules with a match section.
