Set SLA expectations
Supported in:
Google secops
SOAR
A Service Level Agreement (SLA) represents a commitment by the SOC to perform
specific tasks, such as investigating or remediating a case within
a set timeframe. You can configure SLAs for alerts, cases, or both.
Understand the SLA types
Alert SLA : the maximum time to close an alert. An alert SLA is
mainly based on alert attributes (for example, Alert Type or Alert Priority ),
but can also be based on case attributes. The start time begins when the alert is created.
Case SLA : the maximum time to close a case. A Case SLA is
mainly based on case attributes (for example, Case Stage or Case Priority ), but can also be based on alert attributes. The start time begins when the case is created, unless the SLA is configured by Case Stage —in which case it begins when the stage starts.
You can configure an SLA in Settings or automatically using a playbook action.
Manage SLAs
This section explains how to manage SLAs in your environment, including how
to create new rules and how to pause and resume them during an investigation.
Set SLA priorities
If multiple SLA rules are set, the system follows a clear priority order:
Case SLAs : Playbook action > Case Stage > Case Priority
Alert SLAs : Playbook action > Alert Type > Alert Priority
Add an SLA
To add an SLA, follow these steps:
Go to Settings > Environments > SLA .
Click
add
Add .
Select whether the SLA is based on alert attributes (type or priority) or case attributes (stage or priority).
Define the timeframes for the SLA Period (the time before an SLA is breached)
and the SLA Time to Critical Period (the time before the SLA enters a critical phase). For example, an SLA Period of 10 minutes and an SLA Time to Critical Period of 6 minutes results in a 4-minute critical period.
Click Add .
Interpret an SLA Status
An SLA status is indicated by an hourglass hourglass icon. A 'C' next to the hourglass hourglass icon indicates a Case SLA, while an A indicates an Alert SLA . The icon's color shows its status as follows:
Green: The SLA is active.
Gray: The SLA is paused.
In the Cases tab, a green countdown timer indicates an active case SLA at the top. For cases with multiple alerts, the Alerts icon in the header displays all alert SLAs. Each Alert SLA
can be clicked to view the individual alert.
Pause and resume an SLA
You can pause SLAs to provide flexibility during investigations. Pausing a
case SLA doesn't affect an alert SLA, and the other way around. All pause and
resume events are recorded on the Case Wall .
Pause an alert SLA
To pause an alert SLA, do the following:
On the Cases page, select the case with the relevant
alert.
In the alert tab, click
more_vert
More > Alert Options .
Select Pause alert SLA .
Optional: In the Pause alert SLA dialog,
enter a reason for pausing the SLA.
Click Pause .
A gray hourglass hourglass
in the Alert tab indicates that the SLA is paused and a tooltip also
indicates the paused status.
Resume an Alert SLA
To resume the Alert SLA, do the following:
Click
more_vert
More Alert Options .
Select Resume alert SLA .
The green hourglass in the Alert tab indicates that the SLA is running again.
The alerts icon in the case top bar also shows a countdown timer that has
resumed ticking for the resumed Alert SLA.
Pause a case SLA
To pause a case SLA, do the following:
On the Cases page, select the relevant case.
Click
format_list_bulleted
Menu > Case Actions .
Select Pause Case SLA .
Optional: In the Pause Case SLA dialog,
enter a reason for pausing the SLA.
Click Pause .
The case SLA timer in the header turns gray and stops.
A tooltip also indicates the paused status.
Resume a case SLA
To resume a paused case SLA, do the following:
In the case top bar, click
format_list_bulleted
Case Actions .
Select Resume Case SLA .
The timer turns green and resumes the countdown.
Note: The case SLA is automatically paused when a case is closed and automatically resumes when the case is reopened.
