Supported in:
Google secops
SOAR
This document outlines the various actions you can perform on a case, including updating its status or priority, managing associated alerts, generating reports, and taking individual or bulk actions to streamline case handling.

In the Confirmation dialog, click Yes . The page refreshes
and the new incident appears in the case list with the incident icon and a red critical sidebar. The case is automatically assigned to a user with the SOC Manager role.
Change the case stage
If you're assigned a case, you can update its stage, based on your team's workflow.
To change a case stage, follow these steps:
Select a case from the queue.
Click
format_list_bulleted
Case Actions and select

Investigation : The case is assigned an active investigation of alerts and entities.
Improvement : The case is flagged for refining SOC detection rules or follow-up review.
Research : The case is assigned a deeper investigation into external access or threat behavior to your organization.
Incident : The final case stage for critical events. Once you select Incident , you can't change it.
Click Save .
Change the case priority
To change the case priority, follow these steps:
Select a case from the queue.

Explore Alert : For more information about the Alerts Results page, click
Investigate an alert .
Ingest alert as test case : Click Ingest alert as test case to add a new test case to the system. The system marks it as a Test Case for identification. Ingested alerts are excluded from dashboards and reports and are not grouped with other alerts.
Change Priority: We recommend changing the alert priority rather than the case's. Changing the alert priority doesn't affect the case's priority. For more information, see
Change alert priority instead of case priority.
Move Alert : If you're assigned a case with multiple alerts, you can either Move the Alert to new case or Move Alert to existing case . If you select Move Alert to existing case , choose the destination case from the menu and click Move .
Manage Alert Detection Rule : Available only for Google Security Operations users.
If the rule is a predefined Google SecOps rule, the system redirects you to the Rules Detection page. For more information, see Filter data in the Rule Detections view .
If the rule is a customer rule, the system redirects you to the Rules Editor page. For more information, see Manage rules using the Rules Editor .
Close Alert: Closes the alert within the case. Select a value from the Reason , Root Cause , or Usefulness field.
The Usefulness field appears only for Google SecOps users and helps rule analysts get more precise feedback on alert rules from customer input.
Closed alerts in a case appear unavailable and display a Closed tag. You can only close an alert if other alerts are present in the case and it's assigned to you.
Add Entity: Manually add an existing or new entity to an alert.
Run a manual action in a case
Manual actions and playbook actions become available after you install the corresponding integration from the Content Hub.

In the selected case, click Manual Action .
In the Manual Action dialog, select the required action. For example, select VirusTotalV3 > Enrich URL . Enter the required information.
Select the alerts and entities the action should apply to.

Quick actions
The Quick Actions widget lets you define reusable actions that you can
execute directly from cases and alerts. You can add this widget to the default
case view, default alert view, and custom alert views in playbooks.
Defining parameters for Quick Actions is optional. If provided, you can
review and modify them before execution. If left blank, parameters must be
filled in at runtime.
If an integration is removed after a Quick Action is configured, the
corresponding Quick Action button is hidden, and the widget is flagged in the
configuration view to indicate a missing integration.
For setup instructions, see the following:
Define default case view
Define default alert view
Define customized alert views from Playbook Designer
Use case: Configure Quick Action for malicious file investigation
