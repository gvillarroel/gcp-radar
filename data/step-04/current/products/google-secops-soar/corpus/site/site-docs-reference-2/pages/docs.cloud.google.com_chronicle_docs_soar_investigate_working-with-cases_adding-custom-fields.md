Manage custom fields
Supported in:
Google secops
SOAR
Note: This feature is covered by Pre-GA Offerings Terms of the Google Security Operations Service
Specific Terms. Pre-GA features might have limited support, and changes to pre-GA features might not be compatible with other pre-GA versions.
For more information, see the Google SecOps Technical Support Service guidelines
and the Google SecOps Service Specific Terms .
This document describes how to create and manage custom fields, and how to use them for advanced reporting .
Custom fields let administrators add specific information to cases and alerts.
You can organize these custom fields using a Custom Fields Form widget, which
defines the default views for cases and alerts. Analysts can then enter
information directly into this widget from the Overview tab of cases and
alerts, based on the custom field's configured scope.
Create a custom field
Administrators can create up to 1,000 custom fields. Once a custom field is saved,
you can't modify its Scope , Type , or Name .
To create a custom field, do the following:
Go to SOAR Settings > Case Data > Custom Fields .
Click Add Add to create a new custom field.
Select Scope and then select Case , Alert , or All (both). The Scope field is required and can't be changed once the custom field is created.
Enter a custom field Name . The Name field is required and can't be changed after the custom field is created.
In the list, select a custom field Type :
Free Text : Enter any text, up to 1,024 characters.
Radio Button : Provides two customizable options for selection.
Single Select : List with a single option to select.
This type supports a maximum of 1,024 characters, with each option name limited to 255 characters.
Multi Select : List with multiple options to select.
This type supports a maximum of 1,024 characters, with each option name limited to 255 characters.
Calendar : A date and time field. The default format is DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS .
Click Save .
Use case: Use custom fields to enhance phishing resistance
This use case outlines the steps to define three custom fields: a radio button,
a single-select list, and a calendar, and how to add them to the Custom Field Form
widget. These fields enrich the default alert view with additional
information for phishing alerts.
Define the False Positive custom field
For Scope , select Alert .
In the Name field, enter False Positive .
In the Type list, select Radio Button .
In the Options field, enter True Positive (then press Enter ), and
then enter False Positive (then press Enter ).
Click Save .
Define the User Action custom field
Click Add to create another new custom field.
For Scope , select Alert .
In the Name field, enter User Action .
In the Type list, select Single Select .
In the Options field, enter Clicked (then press Enter ), Reported (then press Enter ), and then Ignored (then press Enter ).
Click Save .
Define the Report Time custom field
Click Add to create another new custom field.
For Scope , select Alert .
In the Name field, enter Report Time .
In the Type list, select Calendar .
Click Save .
Add custom fields to the alert-level widget
After defining custom fields, add them to the Custom Fields Form widget.
Each widget can hold up to fifty custom fields. The following steps show how to add
the three custom fields you created previously to the Custom Fields Form
widget to enrich the default alert view.
Go to SOAR Settings > Case Data > Views > Default Alert View . The Default Alert View opens with the available widgets.
On the General tab, drag the Custom Fields Form widget to the Default Alert View .
In the Custom Fields Form widget, click Settings Configuration to open its settings.
In the Widget Title field, enter True or False Positive Alert .
Select Manage Custom Fields .
Select the False Positive , User Action , and Report Time checkboxes,
and then click Save . The system adds these custom fields to the Custom Fields Form widget.
Click the Mandatory toggle.
Select Save to save the configuration and close the window.
Click Save View .
Use the Custom Fields Form widget
After you add custom fields to the Custom Fields Form widget, it appears in
the Overview tab of cases and alerts. Analysts can then enter the required
information directly. Building on the previous example, follow these steps to
use the widget:
On the Alert Overview tab, select the Custom Fields widget, and click edit Edit .
Fill in the relevant information for the three custom fields:
False Positive : Select the radio button to indicate if the alert is a true or false positive.
User Action : Select Clicked , Reported , or Ignored .
Report Time : Select the date the alert was reported.
Click Save .
Use custom fields in playbooks
You can use the custom fields you define on this page as part of playbook actions and placeholders.
For more information about playbook actions, see Integrate Siemplify with Google SecOps .
Placeholders for custom fields
Custom fields are available under the Custom Fields placeholder category. Use the following format for these placeholders:
\[AlertCustom.{custom field name}\]
\[CaseCustom.{custom field name}\]
Use custom fields in advanced reports
Custom fields created for cases can be used in advanced reports to gain
deeper insights from your data.
Note: Advanced reports support only custom fields
that have a Case scope.
Create custom fields for single-select values in Looker
To reference a single-select custom field (for example, "Country" ) in a
Looker report, use the following LookML formula as a calculated
field:
if(
contains(${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},"\"Country\":"),
replace(
replace(
replace(
if(position(
replace(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
substring(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
0,
( position(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
"\"Country\":")
+
length("\"Country\":")
)
),
""
),
"\","
)>0,
substring(
replace(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
substring(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
0,
( position(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
"\"Country\":")
+
length("\"Country\":")
)
),
""
),
0,
position(
replace(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
substring(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
0,
( position(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
"\"Country\":")
+
length("\"Country\":")
)
),
""
),
"\","
)
),
replace(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
substring(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
0,
( position(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
"\"Country\":")
+
length("\"Country\":")
)
),
""
)),
" \"",
""
),
"\"",
""
),
"}",""),
null
)
Tip: To use this formula for a different single-select custom field,
replace all instances of "Country" with the exact name of your
custom field.
Create custom fields for multi-select values in Looker
To reference a multi-select custom field (for example, "Department" ) in a
Looker report, use the following LookML formula as a calculated field:
if(contains(${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},"\"Department\""),
substring(
replace(
replace(
substring(${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
position(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
"\"Department\""),length(${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json}))
,"\", \"Department\":\"",","),
"\"Department\":\"","")
,0, position(replace(
replace(
substring(${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
position(
${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json},
"\"Department\""),length(${vw_cases_custom_values.custom_field_json}))
,"\", \"Department\":\"",","),
"\"Department\":\"",""),"\"")-1)
, null)
Tip: To use this formula for a different multi-select custom field,
replace all instances of "Department" with the exact name of your
custom field.
Filter custom fields in Looker
To effectively filter custom fields in Looker, the method you use depends on whether you are working with a Look or a dashboard.
Filtering in a Look
To filter both single-select and multi-select custom fields in a Look, you
can directly use the custom dimension field created with the preceding formulas.
Filtering on dashboards
To filter custom fields on dashboards, you must reference the underlying JSON
value from Explore and use the appropriate values in the filter, as follows:
Single-select fields: For example, to filter for cases
where the Country custom field is China , use the filter
condition: %"Country": "China"% (where the exact syntax might
vary slightly depending on the Looker version).
Multi-select fields: To filter multi-select fields with
dashboards, reference and use the JSON value and appropriate syntax,
which can vary based on your filtering needs (for example, matching any or
all selected values).
