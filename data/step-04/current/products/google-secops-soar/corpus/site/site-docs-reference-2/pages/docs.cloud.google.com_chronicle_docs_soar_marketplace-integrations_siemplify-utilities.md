Integrate SiemplifyUtilities with
Google SecOps
This document explains how to integrate SiemplifyUtilities
with Google Security Operations (Google SecOps).
Note: This integration uses one or more open source components.
You can download a copy of the full source code of this integration from the
storage bucket .
Use cases
The SiemplifyUtilities integration can address the following use cases:
Export and sharing : Use Google SecOps capabilities with the
Export Entities as OpenIOC File action to quickly generate standardized
OpenIOC files from security entities (such as IPs, Filehashes, or URLs) and
share them with threat intelligence platforms or other security teams.
List manipulation for logic : Use Google SecOps capabilities
with the List Operations action to perform complex logic operations
(such as intersection , union , subtract ) on two different lists of
values within a Playbook, providing advanced filtering or combining of data
sources.
Data Transformation and Analysis : Use Google SecOps
capabilities with the Extract top From JSON action to process and prioritize
large, nested JSON datasets by sorting them based on a specific nested key (like
a severity score) and returning only the top relevant results for immediate
analysis.
Email Forensics : Use Google SecOps capabilities with the
Parse EML to JSON action to convert raw, base64-encoded email messages (EML
or MSG files) into a structured JSON format, making the email's headers, body,
attachments, and links accessible for automated parsing and investigation.
Before you begin
This integration provides native platform capabilities and doesn't require
external third-party API keys or credentials for authentication. Before you
begin, ensure the integration is installed from the Content Hub within your
Google SecOps instance.
Integration parameters
None.
For instructions about how to configure an integration in
Google SecOps, see Configure
integrations .
You can make changes at a later stage, if needed. After you configure an
integration instance, you can use it in playbooks. For more information about
how to configure and support multiple instances, see Supporting
multiple instances .
Actions
