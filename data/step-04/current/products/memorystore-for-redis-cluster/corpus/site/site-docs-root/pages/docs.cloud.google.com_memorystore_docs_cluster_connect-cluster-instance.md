This page explains how to connect to a Memorystore for Redis Cluster instance.
Client support
Memorystore for Redis Cluster does not provide its own client libraries, but rather
supports existing third-party client libraries that support the Redis protocol.
For more information about the client libraries that Redis supports, see Supported connection clients .
Redis-py client best practice
To connect to your Memorystore for Redis Cluster instance using the redis-py Python client, you must add the skip_full_coverage_check=True when declaring a Redis
Cluster:
from rediscluster import RedisCluster
endpoints = [{"host": "IPADDRESS", "port": "6379"}]
rdb = RedisCluster(
startup_nodes=endpoints,
skip_full_coverage_check=True, # Required for Memorystore
decode_responses = True)
print(rdb.set('PYTHON', 'CLUSTER'))
print(rdb.get('PYTHON'))
print(rdb.unlink('PYTHON'))
Allowlist ports on firewall
If you don't allowlist the correct ports on your firewall, your instance can
encounter connection errors. For more information about allowlisting ports, see
Troubleshoot issues .
Cross region access
You can access a Memorystore for Redis Cluster instance from a client located in a
different region than where the Memorystore instance is located.
View your cluster's discovery endpoint
Each cluster has a discovery endpoint to which your client connects.
This endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.
You can view the discovery endpoint of a cluster in Memorystore for Redis Cluster by
using either the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI .
Important: In addition to the discovery endpoint, each cluster has a
data endpoint .
This endpoint is reserved for Memorystore for Redis Cluster to use to connect your
client to nodes in the cluster. Therefore, don't connect to this endpoint
directly.
Console
Go to the Memorystore for Redis Cluster page in the Google Cloud console.
Memorystore for Redis Cluster
Click your Cluster ID.
In the Connect to this instance section, take a note of the IP address
and port number next to Discovery Endpoint . These two values used
together are your cluster's discovery endpoint.
gcloud
To view your cluster's discovery endpoint, run the describe
gcloud CLI as explained in the view instance details section.
The output should be similar to the following:
authorizationMode: AUTH_MODE_DISABLED
createTime: '2023-08-04T17:49:07.988918793Z'

Take a note of the endpoint address and port number listed in the
discovery_endpoints: section. These two values used together are your
cluster's discovery endpoint.
Connect from a Compute Engine VM using redis-cli
You can connect to the Memorystore for Redis Cluster instance from any
Compute Engine VM that uses the Memorystore instance's
authorized network.
To connect to the instance:
If you don't already have a Linux Compute Engine VM that uses the
authorized network for your Memorystore for Redis Cluster instance, create one and
connect to it by following Quickstart to create a Linux VM .
Install redis-cli version 6.0 or newer on the Compute Engine VM by
following the instructions at Install Redis on Linux .
View your cluster's discovery endpoint
and make a note of it.
Connect to your instance's discovery endpoint by running the following
command:
redis-cli -h DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT_ADDRESS -p PORT_NUMBER -c
Where:
DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT_ADDRESS and PORT_NUMBER
are the values you noted in the previous step.
Note: The -c switch is used to enable the redis-cli cluster support mode.
If the -c switch is not provided, when you try to access keys from a
different shard than the one you are connected to, it results in a MOVED
error. In the cluster support mode the client is automatically reconnected
to the address returned in the error response. For more details, see Using Redis-CLI with a Redis Cluster .
Run the CLUSTER SHARDS command to view your cluster topology. Take a note
of one of the node's IP addresses and port numbers.
Connect to your desired node by running the following command:
redis-cli -h NODE_IP_ADDRESS -p NODE_PORT -c
Replace the following:
NODE_IP_ADDRESS is the node's IP address you found in the
previous step.
NODE_PORT is the node's port number you found in the previous
step.
Once connected to the node, enter some Redis commands:
Enter:
PING
Result:
PONG
Enter
SET HELLO WORLD
Result:
OK
Enter:
GET HELLO
Result:
"WORLD"
Once you are done testing your connection to the Redis node, you should
consider deleting the Compute Engine VM you used to connect to the
Redis instance. Doing so helps you avoid incurring charges to your
Cloud Billing account.
Connect to an in-transit encryption enabled instance
This section provides an example of how to connect to a Memorystore for Redis Cluster
instance that has in-transit encryption enabled.
If you don't already have a Compute Engine VM that uses the same
authorized network as the Redis instance from the previous step, create one
and connect to it by following Quickstart using a Linux VM .
Install redis-cli version 6.0 or newer on the Compute Engine VM
by following the instructions at Install Redis on Linux .
Check the Certificate Authority (CA) mode that you're using for your
cluster.
If the CA mode per-instance ,
then install your cluster's CA certificates by following the instructions at
Install CA certificates on the client .
If the CA mode is shared , then
install your cluster's CA certificate bundle by following the instructions
at Install the CA certificate bundle on the client .
If the CA mode is customer-managed ,
then your applications can connect to the cluster without you having to
download and install additional CA certificates. Therefore, you can skip this
step.
View your cluster's discovery endpoint
and make a note of it.
Connect to your instance's discovery endpoint by running the following
command:
redis-cli -h DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT_ADDRESS -p PORT_NUMBER -c --tls --cacert /tmp/server_ca.pem
Where:
DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT_ADDRESS and PORT_NUMBER
are the values you noted in the previous step.
Note: The -c switch is used to enable the redis-cli cluster support mode.
If the -c switch is not provided, when you try to access keys from a
different shard than the one you are connected to, it results in a MOVED
error. In the cluster support mode the client is automatically reconnected
to the address returned in the error response. For more details, see Using Redis-CLI with a Redis Cluster .
Run the CLUSTER SHARDS command to view your cluster topology. Take a note
of one of the node's IP addresses and port numbers.
Connect to your desired node by running the following command:
redis-cli -h NODE_IP_ADDRESS -p NODE_PORT -c --tls --cacert /tmp/server_ca.pem
Replace the following:
NODE_IP_ADDRESS is the node's IP address you found in the
previous step.
NODE_PORT is the node's port number you found in the previous
step.
Once connected to the node, enter some Redis commands:
Enter:
PING
Result:
PONG
