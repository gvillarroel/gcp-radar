About in-transit encryption
Stay organized with collections

You can encrypt all data that moves between your client applications and
Memorystore for Redis Cluster securely. This is in-transit encryption . By using in-transit
encryption, all Redis traffic is encrypted through the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This ensures that all data that
moves between your applications and Memorystore for Redis Cluster remains confidential
and untampered.
When in-transit encryption is enabled, Redis clients communicate exclusively
across a secure connection. Redis clients that aren't configured for TLS are
blocked. If you choose to use in-transit encryption, then you're responsible
for ensuring that your Redis client can use the TLS protocol.
The following are sample use cases for using in-transit encryption:
Protect sensitive cached data : If you use Memorystore for Redis Cluster to store
high-value information, such as session tokens, Personal Identifiable
Information (PII), or API keys, then in-transit encryption prevents attackers
with VPC access from accessing your data.
Comply with industry standards : Many security frameworks, including HIPAA
for healthcare and PCI DSS for financial data, mandate that sensitive
information be encrypted both at rest and in transit for regulatory and industry
compliance purposes.
Secure Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication :
When you use IAM authentication
to manage access to your data, Memorystore for Redis Cluster requires TLS to prevent
the exposure or leaking of authentication tokens during transmission.
Prevent person-in-the-middle attacks : TLS authenticates the server
endpoint using Certificate Authorities (CAs) . CAs
protect your application against server spoofing and unauthorized data
modification as the data moves between your application and
Memorystore for Redis Cluster.
Important: For clusters that have replicas, replicated data is encrypted fully
at the network level, based on Google Cloud encryption standards.
Memorystore for Redis Cluster supports the TLS protocol, versions 1.2 and later.
In-transit encryption prerequisites
To use in-transit encryption with Memorystore for Redis Cluster, you need the
following:
A Redis client that supports TLS or a third-party TLS sidecar.
CA certificates that are installed on the client machine that accesses your
cluster.
Built-in TLS was only supported for Redis, versions 6.0 and later. As a result,
not every Redis client library supports TLS. If you use a client that doesn't
support TLS, then we recommend using a third-party plugin that enables TLS for
your client. You can see an example
of how to connect to a cluster in Memorystore for Redis Cluster that has in-transit
encryption enabled.
Certificate Authorities (CAs)
A cluster that uses in-transit encryption has Certificate Authorities (CAs) that
authenticate the certificates of the machines in the cluster.
Memorystore for Redis Cluster lets you choose a server CA mode. The CA mode determines
which CA hierarchy is used to issue the digital certificates for a cluster.
Memorystore for Redis Cluster offers the following CA modes:
Per-instance CA :
Memorystore for Redis Cluster provisions each cluster with its own, unique CA
infrastructure. To access a cluster securely, you must configure your clients to
trust this CA hierarchy. This involves downloading and installing CA
certificates on each client that accesses the cluster.
Shared CA : a managed,
regionalized CA infrastructure. For each region, you can download a single CA
certificate bundle. This bundle is valid for all clusters located in a region
that you configure to use the shared CA. Using a shared CA reduces the number of
certificates that clients need to manage. This CA mode is available in
Preview .
Customer-managed CA :
use your own CA pool that's hosted on Certificate Authority Service .
If your client applications are configured to trust this CA, then your
applications can connect to a cluster without you having to download and install
additional CA certificates. This gives you greater control and helps you meet
compliance requirements. This CA mode is available in Preview .
Server certificate rotation
Every week, Memorystore for Redis Cluster conducts server-side certificate rotation for
clusters that use the per-instance CA, shared CA, and customer-managed CA modes.
New server certificates apply to new connections only, and existing connections
remain alive during this rotation.
In addition to Memorystore for Redis Cluster conducting a weekly server-side
certificate rotation, for the customer-managed CA mode, you can rotate the
certificates on-demand.
Performance impact of enabling in-transit encryption
The in-transit encryption feature encrypts and decrypts data, which comes with a
processing overhead. As a result, enabling in-transit encryption can reduce the
performance of your clients. Also, when you use in-transit encryption, each
additional connection comes with an associated resource cost.
To determine the latency associated with using in-transit encryption, compare
the performance of your clients. To do this, benchmark the performance of a
cluster that has in-transit encryption enabled against a cluster that has it
deactivated.
Guidelines to improve performance
To improve the performance of a cluster, use the following guidelines:
When possible, decrease the number of client connections. Instead of creating
on-demand, short-lived connections, establish and reuse long-running
connections.
Increase the size
of the cluster.
Increase the CPU resources of your client's host machine. Client machines with
a higher CPU count yield better performance. If you use a Compute Engine VM,
then we recommend that you use optimized clusters.
Decrease the payload size associated with the traffic of your client. Larger
payloads require more round trips.
