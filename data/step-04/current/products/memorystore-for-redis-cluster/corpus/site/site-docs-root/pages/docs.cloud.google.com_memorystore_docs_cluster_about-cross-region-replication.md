About cross-region replication
Stay organized with collections

This page provides an overview of cross-region replication for Memorystore for Redis Cluster.
For instructions on managing cross-region replication, see Work with cross-region replication .
Cross-region replication lets you create secondary clusters from a primary
cluster to make your cluster available for reads in different regions. Secondary
clusters also provide redundancy for disaster recovery scenarios in case of
regional outages.
Key concepts in this page include the following:
Primary cluster. A read-write cluster in a single region.
Secondary cluster. A read-only cluster that replicates from the
primary cluster asynchronously. For information about promoting and detaching
secondary clusters, see the detach and switchover tasks that appear in
How to manage cross-region replication .
Replicator node : A node in the primary cluster's shard that replicates
to a follower node in the secondary cluster. Any primary or replica node in the
shard can serve the role of a replicator.
Follower nodes : Nodes in the secondary cluster that replicate from a
replicator node in the primary cluster. Only primary nodes in the secondary
cluster can have the role of a follower.
Shard count and slot assignment : Primary and secondary clusters have
the same number of shards and slot assignments.
Benefits
Benefits of cross-region replication on Memorystore for Redis Cluster include the
following:
Disaster recovery : If the primary cluster's region becomes unavailable,
then you can detach or switch over to a secondary cluster in another region to
serve read and write requests. Secondary clusters serve read requests without
issuing a switchover or detach command.
Geographically distributed data : Distributing data geographically brings
the data closer to you and decreases read latency.
Geographic load balancing for read traffic : If slow or overloaded
connections occur in one region, then you can route traffic to another region.
Feature behavior
This section explains important behavior for the cross-region replication
feature.
Scale the cluster capacity : When you scale the capacity of the primary cluster,
Memorystore for Redis Cluster scales secondary clusters automatically to match the
primary cluster.
Scale the replica count : You can scale the replica count for primary and secondary clusters independently based
on your workload needs. Updates to the replica count are local only and don't
propagate to other clusters within the cross-region replication collection of
clusters.
Switch over during a potential outage : You can perform a switchover to
promote a secondary cluster, even if the primary cluster isn't available
because of an outage. When the outage is resolved, the unavailable primary
cluster becomes a secondary cluster.
Create online secondary clusters : When adding a secondary cluster to
a primary cluster, the primary cluster stays online. While
Memorystore for Redis Cluster creates the secondary cluster, the primary cluster
handles requests and replicates data.
Create secondary clusters : You can have up to two secondary clusters.
They can be located either in the same region or in different regions from
each other. You can't make an existing cluster into a secondary cluster. You
can add only new clusters as secondary clusters.
Synchronize settings : Memorystore for Redis Cluster synchronizes most cluster
settings automatically between primary and secondary clusters. For more
information about these settings, see Cluster settings .
Pricing : Memorystore for Redis Cluster charges customers that use cross-region
replication for any secondary clusters that Memorystore for Redis Cluster provisions
for cross-region replication. For each node and replica that
Memorystore for Redis Cluster deploys on the secondary cluster, you're charged as per
any other primary cluster. Additionally, you incur networking charges for transferring data between
clusters in different regions.
Perform maintenance updates : To ensure compatibility with cross-region
replication, while creating your secondary cluster, your primary cluster
might undergo a maintenance update. If the primary cluster isn't running the
required software version, then this update happens. The update process might
introduce some additional latency when creating your secondary cluster. For
more information, see About maintenance .
How to manage cross-region replication
Cross-region replication involves the following tasks:
Create a secondary cluster : create a
secondary cluster that replicates data from your primary cluster
continuously.
View the secondary cluster : view
information about the secondary cluster, including the name of the primary
cluster and the other secondary cluster in the replication group.
Detach secondary clusters : detaching
secondary clusters is an operation in which you decouple secondary clusters
from their primary cluster. This makes them fully functional, independent
clusters that allow both reads and writes. After a detach operation, the
secondary clusters no longer replicate data from the primary cluster with
which they were associated formerly. Both the original primary cluster and
the newly detached clusters (former secondaries) function as independent
clusters with no relationship to one another.
You detach secondary clusters for the following reasons:
Regional migration : perform a planned migration of
Memorystore for Redis Cluster resources from their primary region to another
region.
Disaster recovery : activate Memorystore for Redis Cluster resources in a
secondary region rapidly if the resources in the primary region become
unavailable. If the secondary clusters aren't caught up to the primary
cluster fully, then some data loss might occur.
Switch over your clusters : perform a switchover
to reverse the roles of your primary and secondary clusters. You can perform
a switchover for the following reasons:
Test your disaster recovery setup
Switch over during an actual disaster recovery scenario
Perform a migration of your workload
After you complete the switchover, Memorystore for Redis Cluster reverses the
direction of replication. The former secondary cluster can now accept both
reads and writes, while the former primary cluster switches to read-only.
Architecture example for cross-region replication
This diagram shows a primary cluster in the us-east1 region and secondary
clusters in the us-west1 and asia-east1 regions. The direction of
replication is always from the primary cluster to the secondary clusters (for
this example, from the us-east1 region to the other regions).
Even though this diagram shows the same number of replicas in all regions,
cross-region replication lets you have varying numbers of replicas according
to your requirements.
Cluster settings
This section explains the settings that are required, copied, and overridden for
primary and secondary clusters that use cross-region replication. It also
explains the settings that you configure on the primary cluster, and the
settings that you configure locally.
Required parameters to create a secondary cluster
To create a secondary cluster , you must set
values for the following parameters:
Google Cloud project : the project where your primary cluster is located
and where you create the secondary cluster.
Region : the region where you want the secondary cluster to be located.
Private Service Connect configuration : the network setup for the secondary cluster.
Primary cluster : when you create the secondary cluster, you must
indicate a primary cluster. You can use any cluster other than a secondary
cluster as a primary cluster. If you don't have a primary cluster, then create it .
Settings that a secondary cluster copies from the primary cluster
When you create a secondary cluster, this cluster copies the following
settings from the primary cluster:
Shard count
IAM authentication mode
In-transit encryption mode
Cluster configurations
Redis version
Node type
Persistence mode
Override default settings
When you create a secondary cluster, you can use the following settings to
override the default settings:
Zone distribution configuration
Replica count
Maintenance windows
Deletion protection
Automated backups
Update cluster settings
When you update the settings for your cluster in Memorystore for Redis Cluster, you can
change some settings only on the primary cluster. Memorystore for Redis Cluster syncs
these changes to the secondary clusters automatically.
You can change other settings on the primary and secondary clusters
independently. Memorystore for Redis Cluster applies these changes only locally, and
doesn't sync them with the other clusters.
Configure settings on the primary cluster
You must change the following settings on the primary cluster.
Memorystore for Redis Cluster syncs these changes with the secondary clusters
automatically.
Shard count
Cluster configurations
Persistence mode
Redis version
Node type
Configure local settings
You configure the following settings locally:
Deletion protection
Replica count
Maintenance windows
Cluster endpoints
Automated backups
Best practices for switching primary and secondary clusters
When you perform a switchover , we recommend that
you follow the instructions in this section. This way, your application can keep
track of writes and send any writes to the appropriate cluster.
Stop your application from writing to the primary cluster.
If there are multiple secondary clusters to promote, then determine the
secondary cluster that you want to promote to the primary cluster. The
following factors can help you determine which secondary cluster to promote:
How close your application is to the cluster. This can affect write
latency.
The secondary cluster that's most caught up, in terms of data.
The secondary cluster that's closest to the primary cluster, in terms of
settings .
Perform a switchover on the secondary cluster .
Wait for the switchover operation to complete.
Update your application to send any writes to the newly promoted cluster
that you selected in step 2.
