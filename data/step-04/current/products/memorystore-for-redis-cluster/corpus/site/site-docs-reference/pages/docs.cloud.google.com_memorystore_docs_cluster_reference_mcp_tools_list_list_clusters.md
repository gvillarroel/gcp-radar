The following sample demonstrate how to use curl to invoke the list_clusters MCP tool.
Curl Request
curl --location 'https://redis.googleapis.com/mcp' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
--data '{
"method": "tools/call",
"params": {
"name": "list_clusters",
"arguments": {
// provide these details according to the tool' s MCP specification
}
} ,
"jsonrpc" : "2.0" ,

Input Schema
Request for ListClusters .
ListClustersRequest
JSON representation
{
"parent" : string ,
"pageSize" : integer ,
"pageToken" : string
}
Fields
parent
string
Required. The resource name of the cluster location using the form: projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id} where location_id refers to a Google Cloud region.
pageSize
integer
The maximum number of items to return.
If not specified, a default value of 1000 will be used by the service. Regardless of the page_size value, the response may include a partial list and a caller should only rely on response's next_page_token to determine if there are more clusters left to be queried.
pageToken
string

Output Schema
Response for ListClusters .

string
]
}
Fields
clusters[]
object ( Cluster )
A list of Redis clusters in the project in the specified location, or across all locations.
If the location_id in the parent field of the request is "-", all regions available to the project are queried, and the results aggregated. If in such an aggregated query a location is unavailable, a placeholder Redis entry is included in the response with the name field set to a value of the form projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/clusters/ - and the status field set to ERROR and status_message field set to "location not available for ListClusters".
nextPageToken
string
Token to retrieve the next page of results, or empty if there are no more results in the list.
unreachable[]
string
Locations that could not be reached.
