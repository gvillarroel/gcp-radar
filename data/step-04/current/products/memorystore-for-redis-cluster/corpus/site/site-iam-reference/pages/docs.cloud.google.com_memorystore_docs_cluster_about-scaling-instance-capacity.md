About scaling instance capacity
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how your Memorystore for Redis Cluster instance behaves
during scaling.
You can scale the capacity for your instance in the following ways:
You can change the number of shards for your instance. This is horizontal
scaling . You can scale an instance horizontally in one of the following ways:
Scale out : increase the capacity of your instance, which gives the
instance more memory and processing power to handle a larger volume of data or
traffic. Your instance's capacity is determined by the number of shards in
your instance.
By scaling your instance out, your application can handle an increased
demand without performance degradation. To scale an instance out, add
shards to the instance.
Scale in : reduce the capacity of your instance, which decreases both the
processing power and the amount of memory available to store data. This occurs
when your application's data demands decrease and you need to lower your
resource usage to save costs. To scale an instance in, reduce the number of
shards in the instance.
You can change the node type for your instance. This is vertical scaling .
You can scale an instance vertically in one of the following ways:
Scale up : increase the capacity of your instance. Your instance's
capacity is determined by your instance's node type. To scale an instance up,
change the node type to a larger node type. For example, scale your instance
up from a redis-standard-small node type to a redis-highmem-medium node
type.
Scale down : reduce the capacity of your instance. To scale an instance
down, change the node type to a smaller node type. For example, scale your
instance down from a redis-highmem-medium node type to a redis-standard-small
node type.
Important: If you want to scale the node type
for your instance down, and you haven't overwritten the default settings
for the original node type, then Memorystore for Redis Cluster
modifies the default settings to those of the scaled node type.
Note: For more information about the different types and sizes of shards and nodes,
see Cluster and node specification . To learn more about scaling a Memorystore for Redis Cluster instance, see Scale instance capacity .
Impact of scaling
During a scaling operation, the availability of your instance isn't impacted.
However, when you change the number of shards in your instance, Memorystore for Redis Cluster rebalances the instance's keyspace. This
might cause increased latency during the scaling operation.
Also, the impact of scaling your instance vertically by changing the node type
is similar to what happens with a maintenance operation.
Failure scenarios
If you encounter an error during the scaling operation, then it's likely because
of one of the following scenarios:
You want to update the shard count for your instance, but you don't have
enough free memory for the redis-shared-core-nano node type for your instance.
To resolve this issue, you can either scale your instance up or free memory from the nodes of
your instance. To free memory, do the following:
Connect to a Memorystore for Redis Cluster instance .
To get details about the instance, including the IP address and port
number, use the gcloud redis clusters describe command.
Make a note of the IP address and port number of the instance.
To get information about the nodes of the instance, use the following
command:
redis-cli -h IP_ADDRESS -p PORT_NUMBER cluster nodes
Replace IP_ADDRESS and PORT_NUMBER with the values that
you noted in the previous step.
Make a note of the IP address and port number of a node that doesn't have
enough free space. This node's ID matches an ID that appears in the error.
To connect to this node, use the following command:
redis-cli -h IP_ADDRESS -p PORT_NUMBER
Replace IP_ADDRESS and PORT_NUMBER with the values
that you noted in the previous step.
At the prompt, enter the info memory command.
In the output, values for the used_memory and maxmemory parameters appear. used_memory is how much memory the node uses and maxmemory is how much
memory is available for the node.
Divide the value of the used_memory parameter by the value of the
maxmemory parameter, and verify that the quotient is greater than 98%.
To free up space for the node, delete some of the node's keys .
Enter the info memory command again. In the output, the value of the
used_memory parameter is smaller.
Divide the value of the used_memory parameter by the value of the
maxmemory parameter, and verify that the quotient is now less than 98%.
If it isn't, then delete more keys.
For any other nodes that don't have enough free space, repeat steps 4 - 11
of this procedure.
Caution : We recommend that you use the
redis-shared-core-nano node type for development or testing
purposes only because this node type has no SLA. If you run Memorystore for Redis Cluster in
a production environment, then we recommend using the
redis-standard-small , redis-highmem-medium , or
redis-highmem-xlarge node types. For more information about these
node types, see Choose a node type .
You scaled to a smaller shard count that doesn't have the capacity to hold
all of the keys that Memorystore for Redis Cluster stores in the
original instance. To resolve this, scale to a larger shard count that can
hold all of the stored keys. For more information about increasing the number of
shards for your instance, see Scale the shard count .
You scaled to a smaller node type that doesn't have the capacity to hold all
of the data that Memorystore for Redis Cluster stores in the original
node type. If this occurs, then Memorystore for Redis Cluster
provides you with a recommended node type to scale down vertically.
You updated the node type for your instance and either you overwrite the default
settings for the
original node type or these settings are overwritten already. However, the new,
scaled node type either doesn't support the values for the default settings or
the settings aren't valid for the node type. If this occurs, then Memorystore for Redis Cluster returns an error. To resolve this, modify
the settings manually so that they're valid for the new node type.
You scaled your instance during a period of high write pressure (for example,
during load testing). To resolve this, scale during periods of low instance
traffic.
You have a slot which contains a large key, and you want to migrate this key
to another node. However, this node doesn't have sufficient memory to support
the key. You can't update your cluster. To resolve this, reduce the size of the
key so that it's less than 128 MB. Then, retry the update operation.
The slot number that a node of a cluster owns isn't known, but only the slot
range is known. Memorystore for Redis Cluster returns an error message. If this occurs,
then reduce the size of the key and retry the update operation.
You increased the capacity of your cluster by scaling out to a smaller shard
count. However, Memorystore for Redis Cluster doesn't have enough memory to accommodate this
request. To resolve this, reduce the capacity of your cluster by scaling in to
the original, larger shard count.
Best practices
To help you scale the capacity for your instance, and to increase the speed and
reliability of scaling your instance, scale it during low periods of traffic,
whenever you can. To learn how to monitor instance traffic, see Monitor clusters .
