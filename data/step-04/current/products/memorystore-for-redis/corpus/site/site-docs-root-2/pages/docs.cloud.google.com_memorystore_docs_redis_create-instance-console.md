Create a Memorystore for Redis instance by using the Google Cloud console
Learn how to create a Memorystore for Redis instance, connect to it, and then delete
it.
To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the
Google Cloud console, click Guide me :

Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
If you're using an existing project for this guide,
verify that you have
the permissions required to complete this guide . If you created a new
project, then you already have the required permissions.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Memorystore for Redis API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .

To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create a Memorystore for Redis instance,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the project:
Cloud Memorystore Redis Admin ( roles/redis.admin )
Compute Instance Admin (v1) ( roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1 )
Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create a Memorystore for Redis instance
In this section, you create a 2-GB Memorystore for Redis instance that's
located in the us-central1 region and is in the Basic tier. For more
information about tiers, see Redis tier capabilities .
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Memorystore for Redis page.
Memorystore for Redis
Click Create instance .
In the Create a Redis instance page, make the following configurations
for the instance that you're creating:
In the Instance ID field, enter my-instance-1 .
In the Display name field, enter My Quickstart Instance .
In the Tier selection section, select Basic . This tier designates
a standalone Redis node, as opposed to the Standard tier, which uses a
replica node to backup your data.
In the Capacity field, enter 5 . This sets the capacity of your
instance to 5 GB.
From the Region menu, select us-central1 (Iowa) .
From the Network menu, select default .
Expand the Configuration node, and then from the Version menu,
select 7.2 (Recommended) .
Click Create instance .
Note: Memorystore for Redis doesn't support legacy-mode networks. To create
an instance, use a VPC network. For more information, see Create and manage VPC networks .
After you create the instance, obtain your instance's IP address by
following these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Memorystore for Redis page.
Memorystore for Redis
Click the ID of your instance: my-instance-1 .
In the Connections section, make a note of your instance's
Primary Endpoint and Port number of 6379 . You need the
endpoint and port number to connect to the instance.
Connect to the Memorystore for Redis instance from a Compute Engine VM
You can connect to the Memorystore for Redis instance from any Compute Engine
VM that uses the instance's authorized network with a supported RFC 1918 IP address .
If you don't have a Compute Engine VM that uses that same authorized
network as your instance, then create one and connect to the VM by using SSH. To
do this, follow the steps in Create a Linux VM instance in Compute Engine .
Use apt-get to install telnet :
sudo apt-get install telnet
From the terminal, telnet to the IP address of the instance. Replace
VARIABLES with appropriate values.
telnet INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS 6379
If you can connect to the instance, then the command returns this result:
Trying INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS …
Connected to INSTANCE_IP_ADDRESS
In the telnet session, enter some Redis commands:
Enter:
PING
Result:
PONG
Enter
SET HELLO WORLD
Result:
+OK
Enter:
GET HELLO
Result:
$5
WORLD

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Memorystore for Redis page.
Memorystore for Redis
Click the ID of the instance that you want to delete.
Click Delete .
In the prompt that appears, enter the instance ID.
Click Delete .
Optional . If you created a Compute Engine VM for this quickstart,
then delete it.
