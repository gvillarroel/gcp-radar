Manage Memorystore for Redis resources with custom constraints
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud Organization Policy gives you centralized, programmatic
control over your organization's resources. As the
organization policy administrator , you can define an organization policy,
which is a set of restrictions called constraints that apply to
Google Cloud resources and descendants of those resources in the
Google Cloud resource hierarchy . You can enforce organization policies at
the organization, folder, or project level.
Organization Policy provides predefined constraints for various
Google Cloud services. However, if you want more granular, customizable
control over the specific fields that are restricted in your organization
policies, you can also create custom organization policies.
By implementing a custom organization policy you enforce consistent
configurations and restrictions. This ensures that your Memorystore for Redis
instances adhere to security best practices and regulatory requirements.
Benefits
You can use a custom organization policy to allow or deny specific Memorystore for Redis resources. For example, if a request to create or update a Redis instance fails to satisfy
custom constraint validation as set by your organization policy,
the request will fail and an error will be returned to the caller.
Policy inheritance
By default, organization policies are inherited by the descendants of the
resources on which you enforce the policy. For example, if you enforce a policy
on a folder, Google Cloud enforces the policy on all projects in the
folder. To learn more about this behavior and how to change it, refer to
Hierarchy evaluation rules .
Pricing
The Organization Policy Service, including predefined and custom organization policies, is
offered at no charge.
Limitations
Like all organization policy constraints, policy changes don't apply
retroactively to existing instances.
A new policy doesn't impact existing instance configurations.
An existing instance configuration remains valid, unless you change the
instance configuration from a compliance to non-compliance state using the
Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or RPC.
A scheduled maintenance update doesn't cause a policy enforcement, because
maintenance doesn't change the configuration of instances.
Before you begin
Set up your project.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.

Ensure that you know your
organization ID .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to manage organization policies,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Organization policy administrator ( roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin )
IAM role on the organization resource.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
You also need to add required roles to create Memorystore for Redis to your user account. See Configuring access to Memorystore for Redis resources .
Create a custom constraint
You can create a custom constraint by using a YAML file to define the resources, methods, conditions, and actions that are subject to the constraint. These are specific to the service on which you're enforcing the organization policy. Conditions for your custom constraints must be
defined using Common Expression Language. See the GitHub page about
Common Expression Language (CEL) . For more information about how to build
conditions in custom constraints using CEL, see the CEL section of
Creating and managing custom constraints .
Use the following template to create a YAML file for a custom constraint:
name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /customConstraints/ CONSTRAINT_NAME
resourceTypes :
- redis.googleapis.com/ RESOURCE_NAME
methodTypes :
- CREATE
- UPDATE
condition : " CONDITION "
actionType : ACTION
displayName : DISPLAY_NAME
description : DESCRIPTION
Replace the following:
ORGANIZATION_ID : your organization ID, such as
123456789 .
CONSTRAINT_NAME : the name you want for your new
custom constraint. A custom constraint must start with custom. , and can
only include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or numbers, for
example, custom.restrictInstanceToOnereplica . The maximum length of this field is 70
characters, not counting the prefix, for example,
organizations/123456789/customConstraints/custom.allowConstraint .
RESOURCE_NAME : the name (not the URI) of the
Memorystore for Redis resource containing the object and field
you want to restrict. For example, Instance .
CONDITION : a CEL condition that is written against
a representation of a supported service resource. This
field has a maximum length of 1000 characters. See
Supported resources for more information about the
resources available to write conditions against. For example,
"resource.replicaCount >= 2" .
ACTION : the action to take if the condition is
met. This can be either ALLOW or DENY .
DISPLAY_NAME : a human-friendly name for the
constraint. This field has a maximum length of 200 characters.
DESCRIPTION : a human-friendly description of the
constraint to display as an error message when the policy is violated. This
field has a maximum length of 2000 characters.
For more information about how to create a custom constraint, see
Creating and managing custom organization policies .
Set up a custom constraint
Console
To create a custom constraint, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Organization policies page.
Go to Organization policies
From the project picker, select the project that you want to set the organization
policy for.
Click add Custom constraint .
In the Display name box, enter a human-readable name for the constraint. This name is
used in error messages and can be used for identification and debugging. Don't use
personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data in display names because this
name could be exposed in error messages. This field can contain up to 200 characters.
In the Constraint ID box, enter the ID that you want for your new custom
constraint. A custom constraint can only contain letters (including upper and lowercase) or
numbers, for example custom.restrictInstanceToOnereplica . This field can contain up to
70 characters, not counting the prefix ( custom. ), for example,
organizations/123456789/customConstraints/custom . Don't include PII or
sensitive data in your constraint ID, because it could be exposed in error messages.
In the Description box, enter a human-readable description of the constraint. This
description is used as an error message when the policy is violated. Include details about
why the policy violation occurred and how to resolve the policy violation. Don't include
PII or sensitive data in your description, because it could be exposed in error messages.
This field can contain up to 2000 characters.
In the Resource type box, select the name of the Google Cloud REST resource
containing the object and field that you want to restrict—for example,
container.googleapis.com/NodePool . Most resource types support up to 20 custom
constraints. If you attempt to create more custom constraints, the operation fails.
This constraint
can only be enforced on the REST CREATE method.
To see supported methods for each service, find the service in
Services that support custom constraints .
To define a condition, click edit Edit condition .
In the Add condition panel, create a CEL condition that refers to a supported
service resource, for example, resource.management.autoUpgrade == false . This
field can contain up to 1000 characters. For details about CEL usage, see
Common Expression Language .
For more information about the service resources you can use in your custom constraints,
see
Custom constraint supported services .
Click Save .
Under Action , select whether to allow or deny the evaluated method if the condition
is met.
The deny action means that the operation to create or update the resource is blocked if the
condition evaluates to true.
The allow action means that the operation to create or update the resource is permitted only
if the condition evaluates to true. Every other case except those explicitly listed in the
condition is blocked.
Click Create constraint .
When you have entered a value into each field, the equivalent YAML configuration for this
custom constraint appears on the right.
gcloud
To create a custom constraint, create a YAML file using the following format:
name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /customConstraints/ CONSTRAINT_NAME
resourceTypes : RESOURCE_NAME
methodTypes :
- CREATE
condition : " CONDITION "
actionType : ACTION
displayName : DISPLAY_NAME
description : DESCRIPTION
Replace the following:
ORGANIZATION_ID : your organization ID, such as
123456789 .
CONSTRAINT_NAME : the name that you want for your new custom
constraint. A custom constraint can only contain letters (including upper and lowercase)
or numbers, for example, custom.restrictInstanceToOnereplica . This field can contain up to 70
characters, not counting the prefix ( custom. )— for example,
organizations/123456789/customConstraints/custom . Don't include PII or
sensitive data in your constraint ID, because it could be exposed in error messages.
RESOURCE_NAME : the fully qualified name of the Google Cloud
resource containing the object and field that you want to restrict. For example,
redis.googleapis.com/Instance . Most resource types support up to 20 custom
constraints. If you attempt to create more custom constraints, the operation fails.
methodTypes : the REST methods that the constraint is enforced on.
Can only be
CREATE .
To see the supported methods for each service, find the service in
Services that support custom constraints .
CONDITION : a
CEL condition that is written against a representation of a supported service
resource. This field can contain up to 1000 characters. For example,
"resource.replicaCount >= 2" .
For more information about the resources available to write conditions against, see
Supported resources .
ACTION : the action to take if the condition is met.
Can only be ALLOW .
The allow action means that if the condition evaluates to true, the operation to create or
update the resource is permitted. This also means that every other case except the one
explicitly listed in the condition is blocked.
DISPLAY_NAME : a human-readable name for the constraint. This name
is used in error messages and can be used for identification and debugging. Don't use PII
or sensitive data in display names because this name could be exposed in error messages.
This field can contain up to 200 characters.
DESCRIPTION : a human-friendly description of the constraint to
display as an error message when the policy is violated. This field can contain up to
2000 characters.
After you have created the YAML file for a new custom constraint, you must set it up to make
it available for organization policies in your organization. To set up a custom constraint,
use the
gcloud org-policies set-custom-constraint command:
gcloud org-policies set-custom-constraint CONSTRAINT_PATH
Replace CONSTRAINT_PATH with the full path to your custom constraint
file. For example, /home/user/customconstraint.yaml .
After this operation is complete, your custom constraints are available as organization
policies in your list of Google Cloud organization policies.
To verify that the custom constraint exists, use the
gcloud org-policies list-custom-constraints command:
gcloud org-policies list-custom-constraints --organization = ORGANIZATION_ID
Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with the ID of your organization resource.
For more information, see
Viewing organization policies .
Enforce a custom organization policy
You can enforce a constraint by creating an organization policy that references it, and then
applying that organization policy to a Google Cloud resource.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Organization policies page.
Go to Organization policies
From the project picker, select the project that you want to set the
organization policy for.
From the list on the Organization policies page, select your constraint to view
the Policy details page for that constraint.
To configure the organization policy for this resource, click Manage policy .
On the Edit policy page, select Override parent's policy .
Click Add a rule .
In the Enforcement section, select whether this organization policy is enforced or
not.
Optional: To make the organization policy conditional on a tag, click
Add condition . Note that if you add a conditional rule to an organization
policy, you must add at least one unconditional rule or the policy cannot be saved. For more
information, see
Scope organization policies with tags .
Click Test changes to simulate the effect of the organization policy. For more
information, see
Test organization policy changes with Policy Simulator .
To enforce the organization policy in dry-run mode, click Set dry run policy . For
more information, see
Test organization policies .
After you verify that the organization policy in dry-run mode works as intended, set the
live policy by clicking Set policy .
gcloud
To create an organization policy with boolean rules, create a policy YAML file that
references the constraint:
name : projects/ PROJECT_ID /policies/ CONSTRAINT_NAME
spec :
rules :
- enforce : true
dryRunSpec :
rules :
- enforce : true
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project that you want to enforce your constraint
on.
CONSTRAINT_NAME : the name you defined for your custom constraint. For
example, custom.restrictInstanceToOnereplica .
To enforce the organization policy in
dry-run mode , run
the following command with the dryRunSpec flag:
gcloud org-policies set-policy POLICY_PATH --update-mask = dryRunSpec
Replace POLICY_PATH with the full path to your organization policy
YAML file. The policy requires up to 15 minutes to take effect.
After you verify that the organization policy in dry-run mode works as intended, set the
live policy with the org-policies set-policy command and the spec
flag:
gcloud org-policies set-policy POLICY_PATH --update-mask = spec
Replace POLICY_PATH with the full path to your organization policy
YAML file. The policy requires up to 15 minutes to take effect.
Test a custom constraint
To test a custom constraint, run a gcloud command that attempts to create a Redis instance.
For example, assume that a constraint requires that Redis instances should not have more than one replica. You could test this constraint by running the gcloud redis instances create command with replica-count set to 2 as demonstrated in the following snippet:
gcloud redis instances create redis-test-instance \
--project=my-project \
--tier=standard \
--size=16 \
--region=us-central1 \
--redis-version=redis_7_0 \
--network=projects/my-project/global/networks/default \
--connect-mode=PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS \
--read-replicas-mode=READ_REPLICAS_ENABLED \
--replica-count=2
The output is similar to the following:
Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.restrictInstanceToOnereplica": "Prevent users from creating Redis instances with more than one replica"]
