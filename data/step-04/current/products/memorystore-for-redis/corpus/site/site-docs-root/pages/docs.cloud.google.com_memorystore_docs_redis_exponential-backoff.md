Exponential backoff
Stay organized with collections

Exponential backoff is a standard error handling
strategy for network applications in which a client periodically retries a
failed request with increasing delays between requests. Clients should use
exponential backoff for all requests to Memorystore for Redis that return
HTTP 5xx and 429 response code errors.
Understanding how exponential backoff works is important if you are:
Building client applications that use the Memorystore for Redis REST API
directly.
Accessing Memorystore for Redis through a client library .
Note that some client libraries, such as the Memorystore for Redis Client Library for Node.js ,
have built-in exponential backoff.
If you are using the Google Cloud console , the console sends
requests to Memorystore for Redis on your behalf and handles any necessary
backoff.
Example algorithm
An exponential backoff algorithm retries requests exponentially,
increasing the waiting time between retries up to a maximum backoff time. An
example is:
Make a request to Memorystore for Redis.
If the request fails, wait 1 + random_number_milliseconds seconds and retry
the request.
If the request fails, wait 2 + random_number_milliseconds seconds and retry
the request.
If the request fails, wait 4 + random_number_milliseconds seconds and retry
the request.
And so on, up to a maximum_backoff time.
Continue waiting and retrying up to some maximum number of retries, but
do not increase the wait period between retries.
where:
The wait time is min(((2^ n )+ random_number_milliseconds ), maximum_backoff ),
with n incremented by 1 for each iteration (request).
random_number_milliseconds is a random number of milliseconds less than or
equal to 1000. This helps to avoid cases where many clients get synchronized by
some situation and all retry at once, sending requests in synchronized
waves. The value of random_number_milliseconds should be recalculated after
each retry request.
maximum_backoff is typically 32 or 64 seconds. The appropriate value
depends on the use case.
It's okay to continue retrying once you reach the maximum_backoff time.
Retries after this point do not need to continue increasing backoff time. For
example, if a client uses an maximum_backoff time of 64 seconds, then after
reaching this value, the client can retry every 64 seconds. At some point,
clients should be prevented from retrying infinitely.
The maximum backoff and maximum number of retries that a client uses
depends on the use case and network conditions. For example, mobile
clients of an application may need to retry more times and for longer intervals
when compared to desktop clients of the same application.
If the retry requests fail after you exceed the maximum number of retries, then
report or log an error using one of the methods listed in Get support .
