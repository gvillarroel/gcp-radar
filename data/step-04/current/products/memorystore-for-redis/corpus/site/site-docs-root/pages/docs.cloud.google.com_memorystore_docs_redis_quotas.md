Quotas and limits
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document contains the current resource capacity limits and per-second API
request quotas for Memorystore for Redis.
Instance limits
Memorystore for Redis enforces the following usage limits:
Limit
Value 1
Databases per instance
16
Connected clients per instance for Basic Tier
65,000
Connected clients per instance for Standard Tier
65,000
Connected clients per instance for Standard Tier with read replicas
65,000 for each node including the primary and read replicas
1 For instances that use both in-transit encryption and Redis version 6.x or earlier, connection limits can be lower. For more information, see Connection limits for in-transit encryption .
Regional capacity quota
You can use the default per-project quota for Memorystore for Redis to
provision 1 TB of Redis capacity in each region where the service is available.
Quota
Value
Data provisioned per region
1 TB
For example, if you provision three instances in your project with 300 GB
each in us-central1 , then you consume 900 GB out of the 1-TB quota for
us-central1 . With the default quota, you can provision an additional
100 GB in us-central1 .
Per-second API requests quota
Note:
You cannot request a quota increase for Memorystore for Redis API operations, such as instance create , update , and export . There is no limit to the number of Redis commands you can run, such as Redis SET , GET , and DEL .
Follow the Exponential backoff recommendations
to reduce the number of API requests made if an error is encountered.
The per-second quota for Memorystore for Redis API requests/operations is as
follows, and is subject to change:
API Requests Quota
Value
Create Redis instance requests per project per minute
30
API Requests per minute
3,000
Create Redis instance requests per project per minute includes create operations ( gcloud redis instances create ).
Memorystore for Redis API operations include:
Get operations ( gcloud redis instances describe )
List operations ( gcloud redis instances list )
Create operations ( gcloud redis instances create )
Delete operations ( gcloud redis instances delete )
Import and export operations ( gcloud redis instances import and gcloud redis instances export )
Update operations ( gcloud redis instances update )
Upgrade operations ( gcloud redis instances upgrade )
Failover operations ( gcloud redis instances failover )
This quota is for redis.googleapis.com requests/operations, not OSS Redis
protocol/commands. These limits apply to each Google Cloud console project and
are shared across all applications and IP addresses using that project.
