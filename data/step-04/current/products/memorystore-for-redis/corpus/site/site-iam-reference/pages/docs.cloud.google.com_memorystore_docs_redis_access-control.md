Access control with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: If you are looking for the Memorystore for Redis Cluster documentation,
see Access control with IAM .
This page describes how you can control Memorystore for Redis project access and
permissions using Identity and Access Management (IAM).
Overview
Google Cloud offers IAM, which lets you give more granular access
to specific Google Cloud resources and prevents unwanted access to other
resources. This page describes the Memorystore for Redis IAM roles and
permissions. For a detailed description of roles and permissions, see the
IAM documentation .
Memorystore for Redis provides a set of predefined roles
designed to help you easily control access to your Redis resources. If the
predefined roles do not provide the sets of permissions you need, you can also
create your own custom roles. In addition, the older basic roles
(Editor, Viewer, and Owner) are also still available to you, although they do
not provide the same fine-grained control as the Memorystore for Redis roles.
In particular, the basic roles provide access to resources across
Google Cloud, rather than just for Memorystore for Redis.
For more information about basic roles, see Basic roles .
Permissions and roles
This section summarizes the permissions and roles that Memorystore for Redis
supports.
Predefined roles
Memorystore for Redis provides some predefined roles that you can use to
provide finer-grained permissions to principals. The role you grant to a
principal controls what actions the principal can take. Principals can be
individuals, groups, or
service accounts .
You can grant multiple roles to the same principal, and if you have the
permissions to do so, you can change the roles granted to a principal at
any time.
The broader roles include the more narrowly defined roles. For example, the
Redis Editor role includes all of the permissions of the Redis Viewer role,
along with the addition of permissions for the Redis Editor role. Likewise, the
Redis Admin role includes all of the permissions of the Redis Editor role, along
with its additional permissions.
The basic roles (Owner, Editor, Viewer) provide permissions
across Google Cloud. The roles specific to Memorystore for Redis
provide only Memorystore for Redis permissions, except for the
following Google Cloud permissions, which are needed for
general Google Cloud usage:
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
The following table lists the predefined roles available
for Memorystore for Redis, along with their Memorystore for Redis
permissions:

Custom roles
If the predefined roles do not address your unique business requirements, you
can define your own custom roles with permissions that you specify. To support
this, IAM offers custom roles . When you create custom roles
for Memorystore for Redis, make sure that you include
both resourcemanager.projects.get and resourcemanager.projects.list .
Otherwise, the Google Cloud console will not function correctly
for Memorystore for Redis. For more information, see
Permission dependencies .
To learn how to create a custom role, see Creating a custom role .
Required permissions for common tasks in the Google Cloud console
To enable a user to work with Memorystore for Redis using
the Google Cloud console, the user's role must include the
resourcemanager.projects.get and the resourcemanager.projects.list
permission.
The following table provides the other permissions required for some common
tasks in the Google Cloud console:

Required permissions for gcloud commands
To enable a user to work with Memorystore for Redis using gcloud commands,
the user's role must include the resourcemanager.projects.get and the
resourcemanager.projects.list permission.
The following table lists the permissions that the user invoking a gcloud
command must have for each gcloud redis subcommand:

Required permissions for API methods
The following table lists the permissions that the caller must have to call each
method in the Memorystore for Redis API or to perform tasks
using Google Cloud tools that use the API
(such as the Google Cloud console or the gcloud command line tool):
Note : To call a method, in addition to the
permissions in the following table, you must also have the required scopes.
These scopes are described in the method's reference page. For more information,
see Authorize requests .
All permissions are applied to the project. You can't apply different
permissions based on the instance or on other lower-level objects.

The Memorystore for Redis service account
Each Memorystore for Redis instance has a service account that it uses to
communicate with other Google Cloud resources.
Sometimes (like when exporting , or using CMEK )
you must grant specific roles or permissions to the service account.
Memorystore for Redis service account format
Your instance's service account uses one of two different formats, depending on
when it was created.
The first format is:
PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
The second format is:
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @cloud-redis.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Note: For the first format, replace PROJECT_NUMBER with the project
number of your default Compute Engine service account. For the second format,
replace PROJECT_NUMBER with the project number of your
Google Cloud project. Also, for more information about which format your instance's
service account uses, see View your instance's service account .
Known issues
Sometimes a service account using the [PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
format can conflict with your organization policy. For more information, and
steps to resolve this issues, see Issues with the domain restricted sharing organization policy .
View your instance's service account
To view the service account for your instance, run the following
command and make a note of the service account listed under
persistenceIamIdentity :
gcloud redis instances describe [ INSTANCE_ID ] --region=[REGION]
Redis AUTH permissions
The following table shows the minimum permissions a user needs to complete some
basic Memorystore for Redis AUTH
tasks.

Required permissions for import and export
Using custom roles for importing and exporting requires two separate custom
roles. One custom role for the user, and an additional custom role for the Redis
instance's service account. The custom role for the service account uses
Cloud Storage bucket level permissions.
To find the service account for your instance, see View your instance's service account
Permissions for the service account
Note that you only need to grant storage permissions to the service account at
the bucket-level, not the entire project. For instructions, see Adding a principal
to a bucket-level policy .
Once you grant your service account bucket-level permissions, you can
ignore the message that says "Memorystore is unable to verify if service account
xxxx@xxxx.gserviceaccount.com has the permissions required
to import/export. For help verifying or updating permissions, contact your
project's administrator. For the required permissions, see import/export
permissions documentation." If you apply the permissions listed below to
custom roles for the user account and the service account, the import/export
will succeed.
