This page provides an overview of maintenance for Memorystore for Redis.
For instructions on scheduling maintenance windows, see Finding and setting maintenance windows .
Overview
Memorystore for Redis routinely updates instances to ensure that the service is
reliable, performant, secure, and up-to-date. Most of these updates are
performed while your Redis instance is up and running. However, certain system
updates require a brief service interruption to be performed. These updates are
called maintenance . Maintenance typically falls into the following categories:
Memorystore features. To launch some features, Memorystore
requires a maintenance update.
Operating system patches. We continuously monitor for newly identified
security vulnerabilities in the operating system. Upon discovery, we patch the
operating system to protect you from new risks.
Database version upgrades. Maintenance can include an OSS Redis patch
minor version update which does not include breaking or incompatible changes.
In addition to maintenance windows, you can also update your instance using
Self-service maintenance
once an update is available
for your instance. The Maintenance changelog
lists the maintenance version number and details for self-service maintenance
updates.
Impact of maintenance
Both Basic Tier and Standard Tier instances undergo a connection reset during
maintenance. You should create a retry mechanism with exponential backoff
to reconnect the application to the instance after maintenance occurs.
You should also take measures so that the System Memory Usage Ratio
metric is at 50% or lower at the time of the scheduled maintenance. The System
Memory Usage Ratio guidance refers to an 80% threshold for memory management,
but we recommend targeting a ratio of 50% or lower during maintenance.
You can ensure the desired ratio by scheduling for a time when instance traffic
is low, or by temporarily scaling up your instance size during the maintenance
window so that the System Memory Usage Ratio metric is at 50% or lower.
Caution: When Memorystore for Redis applies maintenance to an instance that
has read replicas, Memorystore for Redis first applies the new maintenance
version to the read replicas. Then, Memorystore for Redis applies the
maintenance version to the primary instance. When this occurs, you might
experience a spike in CPU usage for each replica and the primary instance. In
addition, the client application can't connect to the read replicas until
Memorystore for Redis completes maintenance on the primary instance.
Standard Tier impact
During maintenance, Standard Tier instances undergo a failover. A failover
typically lasts for 15 seconds. After the failover, client applications
need to reconnect. Once you receive an email notifying you of upcoming
maintenance, you can run a manual failover
on a non-production instance to test the impact maintenance has on your
instance.
Basic Tier impact
Basic Tier instances are unavailable during maintenance, which typically lasts
about 5 minutes.
Maintenance settings
Memorystore offers you the ability to configure maintenance to occur at the most
opportune time for your application. You can do this by configuring a
maintenance window.
Maintenance windows are set per Memorystore instance and allow the
following configuration options:
Day of the week. Designates the day when maintenance occurs.
Start hour. The hour that maintenance begins.
The duration of the maintenance window is 1 hour.
If a maintenance window is configured for an instance, future automatic
maintenance is scheduled to respect these preferences. If a maintenance window
is not specified for your instance, maintenance can begin at any time without
advanced notification.
Maintenance example
Assume you are a developer at a retailer managing a shopping cart service. You
have one Memorystore for Redis instance for a production environment. You want
maintenance to occur at the time when your instance handles the lowest amount of
traffic, which is around midnight on Sundays.
In this case, you set your production instance's maintenance window to:
Day of the week. Sunday.
Start hour. 1 AM.
Upcoming maintenance notifications
You can have a notification about upcoming maintenance sent to your email at
least one week before maintenance is scheduled. If you want to set an email
filter for notifications, the email title is "Upcoming maintenance for your
Cloud Memorystore instance [your-instance-name]" .
Maintenance notifications are not sent out by default. If you want to get a
notification for an upcoming maintenance you must do all of the following:
Set a maintenance window .
Opt in to maintenance notifications .
Do both of these at least 7 days before Memorystore schedules
a maintenance update for your instance. Otherwise, you have not signed up for
notifications in enough time for the system to send you a notification of
upcoming maintenance.
Notifications are sent to the email address associated with your Google account.
It is not possible to configure a custom email alias (for instance, a team email
alias), nor is it possible to subscribe another email address other than your
own.
When subscribing you opt-in to maintenance notifications for all
Memorystore instances that have maintenance windows in a given
project. You receive one notification per instance.
For instructions on finding scheduled maintenance, see Find scheduled maintenance .
Rescheduling maintenance
If you have a maintenance window for your instance, you can reschedule
maintenance at any time before maintenance is scheduled. For example,
if you have a new service launching during your scheduled maintenance
time, you might want to reschedule the maintenance window to a few days after
your launch.
You can reschedule maintenance as long as it's not more than one week after the
originally scheduled time. You can reschedule maintenance up to two times. As a
result, you can extend the maintenance schedule for up to two weeks from the
originally scheduled time.
You have a few scheduling options for the new maintenance window:
Update now. You can apply the update to your instance immediately instead
of waiting for the scheduled maintenance window.
Defer to next scheduled window. This defers maintenance by one week.
Custom day and time. This lets you choose any specific time within one
week after the originally scheduled maintenance time.
Rescheduling maintenance has the following additional behavior:
You cannot reschedule maintenance if less than an hour remains before
currently scheduled maintenance.
You cannot reschedule for multiple Redis instances with a single operation.
They must be rescheduled individually.
For instructions on rescheduling maintenance see Reschedule planned maintenance .
Caution: Although Memorystore does not provide the option to
reschedule maintenance for multiple instances at once, some
Memorystore users with large instance counts opt to
programmatically reschedule in bulk.
If you are rescheduling in bulk, it is important to batch your operations into
appropriate sized requests. We recommend limiting the batch size to
100 instances and waiting ample time between requests. Exceeding
this limit can result in failed rescheduling events.
FAQ
The following are some frequently asked questions about the maintenance policy
for Memorystore for Redis:
What is the impact of maintenance on Standard Tier instances?
During maintenance, Standard Tier instances undergo a failover. A failover
typically lasts for 15 seconds. After the failover, client applications
need to reconnect. For more details on impact, see Impact of maintenance .
What is the impact of maintenance on Basic Tier instances?
Basic Tier instances are unavailable during maintenance which typically lasts
about 5 minutes. For more details on impact, see Impact of maintenance .
How do I know when maintenance is scheduled for my instance?
We recommend subscribing for notifications to learn when maintenance is
scheduled for your instance. You can also check manually in the Cloud console.
If the Cloud console is blank and you have already set a maintenance window,
you do not have upcoming maintenance scheduled yet.
When am I notified of upcoming maintenance?
If you are subscribed for maintenance notifications and have set a maintenance
window, you are alerted by email at least seven days before a maintenance event.
How long can I defer maintenance?
Once maintenance has been scheduled for your instance, you may start the update
for your instance immediately or defer the update for up to seven days from the
originally scheduled maintenance time. For example, if maintenance is scheduled
for Oct. 11 at 11:15 PM, you can defer until Oct. 18 at 11:15 PM. Maintenance
will be applied at the scheduled time if no action is taken.
For more details, see Rescheduling maintenance .
Will the IP address of my instance change during maintenance?
When you connect to a Memorystore for Redis instance, you specify the service IP
address. This IP address will not be modified during maintenance or by any other
action you take. By using the service IP address, the service will handle events
like instance failover for you automatically.
What best practices should I follow for a smooth maintenance update experience?
We recommend you to take the following actions to ensure a smooth maintenance
update experience:
You should
set your maintenance window
to a time ensuring maintenance is not applied in your peak hours of Redis
use.
You should
opt-in to maintenance notifications
to be alerted by email at least seven days before a maintenance update is
scheduled for your instance.
Ensure that the
System Memory Usage Ratio
metric is below 50% when maintenance starts. You can do this by scheduling
for a time when instance traffic is low, or by temporarily scaling up your
instance size during the maintenance window.
When should I apply maintenance immediately?
One circumstance when you should apply maintenance immediately is on a test
instance to see how it will affect a production instance. You can
reschedule maintenance
to have it apply immediately on a test instance. This allows you to observe the
impact it has, and defer maintenance on production instances as needed/allowed.
Do maintenance updates always complete inside the maintenance window?
An update starts inside of the maintenance window you specify. The update
usually completes within the window, but this is not guaranteed.
Can I opt out of maintenance or schedule maintenance on certain instances first?
No, you can neither opt out of maintenance nor control the initial scheduling of
maintenance. However, you can reschedule maintenance to defer it for up to seven days.
