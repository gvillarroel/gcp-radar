About importing and exporting data
Stay organized with collections

This page explains how imports and exports work in Memorystore for Redis.
The import and export feature uses the native RDB snapshot feature of Redis to
import data into or export data out of a Memorystore for Redis instance. The
use of the native RDB format prevents lock-in and makes it very easy to move
data within Google Cloud or outside of Google Cloud. Import and export uses
Cloud Storage buckets to store RDB files.
The behavior of a Memorystore for Redis instance during export is very similar
to the BGSAVE command in open source Redis. Memorystore for Redis imports by
copying your RDB file into your instance's data directory.
For instructions on how to import and export RDB files, see Importing data to
a Redis instance and
Exporting data from a Redis instance .
Import feature behavior
For optimal performance, you should import from Cloud Storage buckets
located in the same region as your Redis instance.
Your Redis instance is unavailable during an import operation. Your instance
becomes available after the import operation finishes.
If an import is successful, the existing data in the instance is overwritten
by the data in the RDB file.
If an import fails for any reason, the instance is brought online, but
the data may be fully flushed. You can retry the import using the same RDB
file, or you may use another RDB file to restore data.
Your Memorystore for Redis instance can import RDB files from the same Redis
version and from a previous Redis version, but it cannot import RDB files
from a newer version.
An import operation can be cancelled, but you should note that the
cancellation results in your instance recovering with a fully flushed
cache. This is the case for both Basic Tier and Standard Tier instances.
An instance can only import backups from older Redis versions. An instance
running Redis 5.0 can import an RDB exported from Redis 4.0, but an instance
running Redis 4.0 cannot import an RDB from Redis 5.0.
Export feature behavior
You can read and write data to your Redis instance during an export operation;
however, you cannot perform any admin operations like scaling, updating,
or configuring your instance.
Your instance may experience increased latency during the export.
For optimal performance, you should export your RDB backups to
Cloud Storage buckets located in the same region as your Redis instance.
During an export, the RDB file is saved to a Cloud Storage bucket of your
choice.
You can cancel an export operation at any time. Cancelling does not impact
the data or availability of an instance.
Cancelling an export deletes the RDB file being written to the
Cloud Storage bucket, and frees up memory used by the BGSAVE
process.
An export can overwrite an existing file with the same name with no extra
permissions when using the Google Cloud console. To export over an existing
file with gcloud , the user account needs the storage.objects.delete
permission.
Exporting under high write load
If you run an export during a period of high write-load your instance memory
usage can increase up to 2X, causing the export operation to fail. You should
perform export operations during periods of low writes. To monitor how much
Redis data is stored in your instance you can create a dashboard to monitor your memory usage
and monitor the instance memory usage metrics
with Cloud Monitoring.
Memorystore for Redis export uses the BGSAVE feature of Redis to take a
snapshot of the data in an instance. When executing BGSAVE , Redis forks a new
child process to take the snapshot. Redis utilizes copy-on-write
during this process.
This means that the initial fork allocates minimal extra memory, but any pages
changed by Redis server write traffic are duplicated. Therefore, under
periods of high writes, in the worst case, the memory footprint of Redis
doubles, causing the export operation to fail.
Exporting during a BGSAVE operation
You cannot export while a BGSAVE operation is running. Standard Tier
Memorystore for Redis instances sometimes run full resynchronization
operations, or 'full syncs', to keep the primary and the replica synchronized. A
full resynchronization uses the BGSAVE command, which prevents
Memorystore from performing an export.
To verify if a BGSAVE operation is ongoing, view the
redis.googleapis.com/persistence/rdb/bgsave_in_progress API endpoint with
Metrics Explorer.
To view the metrics for a monitored resource by using the
Metrics Explorer, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
leaderboard Metrics explorer page:
Go to Metrics explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
In the Metric element, expand the Select a metric menu, and then
select a resource type and metric type. For example, to chart the CPU utilization of a
virtual machine, do the following:
(Optional) To reduce the menu's options, enter part of the metric name in the
Filter bar . For this example, enter utilization .
In the Active resources menu, select VM instance .
In the Active metric categories menu, select Instance .
In the Active metrics menu, select CPU utilization and then
click Apply .
To filter which time series are displayed, use the
Filter element .
To combine time series, use the menus on the
Aggregation element .
For example, to display the CPU utilization for your VMs, based on their zone, set the
first menu to Mean and the second menu to zone .
All time series are displayed when the first menu of the Aggregation element
is set to Unaggregated . The default settings for the Aggregation element
are determined by the metric type you selected.
Alternatively, you can use your own command line API tools.
Required permissions for importing and exporting
A user needs to configure sufficient IAM permissions to import or
export RDB files. The simplest permissions setup is to apply the Cloud
Memorystore Redis Admin and Storage Admin IAM roles to the
user account. However, this setup might be inappropriate for some user accounts
because it gives them permissions to create, edit, or delete resources they
shouldn't have access to. For instructions on setting minimally restricted
permissions, see Granting restricted permissions for import and export .
Duration of imports and exports
The duration of the import or export depends on the instance size and the size
of the data set in the instance. Depending on the size, the imports and exports
can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.
For example, if you import or export a 10 GB instance with 8 GB of used memory,
the operation can take 5 minutes. If you import or export a 120 GB instance with
100 GB of used memory, the operation can take an hour.
Stopping an import or export
To stop an import or export, refer to the following pages:
Stopping an ongoing import operation .
Stopping an ongoing export operation .
Monitoring progress of the operation
The time estimate for completion is not available while doing import and export.
You can check whether the operation is in progress by checking the instance
details page. To view the instance details page, click your instance ID on the
Memorystore for Redis instances list
page.
You can also monitor the progress of an import operation by running the
following command:
gcloud redis instances describe [ INSTANCE_ID ] --region=[REGION]
Where:
[INSTANCE_ID] is the ID for your Memorystore for Redis instance.
[REGION] is the region your instance is in.
The command outputs state: IMPORTING or state: READY as one of the
description fields.
Unsupported Cloud Storage buckets
Requester Pays Cloud Storage buckets are not supported for
Memorystore imports and exports.
Securing your Cloud Storage buckets
You should ensure that your Cloud Storage bucket has the right restrictions
to prevent unauthorized access to the Redis RDB backup it contains. Please
refer to Cloud Storage Access Control Options
on how to secure your Cloud Storage buckets.
Ensuring sufficient memory to complete an export
To prevent export from causing memory starvation, you should have 50% free
memory in the instance during the export process. This may not be required all
the time, depending on your write load, but having 50% free memory ensures that
there is enough free space to accommodate copy-on-write overhead, if many pages
are touched during the export process.
To understand the current memory usage of your instance, set up an
alert
to notify you when your memory usage reaches a customizable threshold.
Additionally you should set up a memory monitoring dashboard
with Cloud Monitoring. These measures allow you to understand your instances
memory usage patterns. Understanding memory usage patterns enables you to size
your instance correctly when exporting at regular intervals.
Exporting and importing to instances with read replicas
For all Redis instances, including read replica enabled instances, data is
exported from the primary node.
For read replica enabled instances ,
exporting can increase the CPU load and memory footprint on the primary node.
When importing data into a read replica enabled instance, the primary restarts
during the import operation, and the instance is unavailable until the new data
is fully loaded into the database.
