This document describes spend-based committed use discounts (CUDs) for Memorystore for Redis.
Committed use discounts (CUDs) for Memorystore for Redis provide
discounted prices in exchange for your commitment to continuously spend a
minimum hourly amount on Memorystore for Redis capacity for a year or longer.
Memorystore for Redis spend-based CUDs are ideal when your spending on
Memorystore for Redis capacity involves a predictable minimum that you can
commit to for at least a year.
Memorystore for Redis CUD commitments are fungible across all Memorystore
services, including Memorystore for Memcached,
Memorystore for Redis Cluster, and Memorystore for Valkey.
Important: This page explains the new and improved committed use discounts (CUDs) program,
which applies to any customers who purchase their first CUDs on or after
July 15, 2025 . For more information, see
Spend-based CUDs program improvements .
Note: CUDs are only available for Redis instances with a size of 5 GB or
greater.
Memorystore for Redis CUD pricing
Memorystore for Redis CUDs offer two levels of discounts, depending on the
commitment period:
20% discount : You get this by committing to a 1-year term. For the
duration of your term, you pay the Memorystore for Redis CUD 1-year price
(consumption model ID DD5B-8EB3-C48D) as your committed hourly spend amount.
40% discount : You get this by committing to a 3-year term. For the
duration of your term, you pay the Memorystore for Redis CUD 3-year price
(consumption model ID 8E4B-B283-45D8) as your committed hourly spend amount.
When you purchase a commitment, you agree to pay a fixed hourly fee for a one
or three-year term. Your monthly invoice shows usage charges using the
CUD consumption model
prices for usage that falls within your commitment. You're charged $1 for
$1 worth of commitment fees, and a corresponding credit applies so that the
commitment fee is offset for any utilized portion of your commitment.
For a full example, see
An example Memorystore for Redis CUD .
For any unused portion of your commitment, the fee applies. The result
is that you pay the flat commitment fee every hour, whether you use the
services or not, but commitment fees are then credited back to you for the
used portions within the commitment amount.
Any expenditure beyond the commitment gets billed at the on-demand rate.
As your usage grows, you can purchase additional commitments to receive
discounts on increased expenditures not covered by previous commitments.
The CUD discount applies to any eligible usage in projects
associated with the Cloud Billing account.
If the on-demand rates change after you purchase a commitment,
your commitment fee doesn't change.
The discount applies to any eligible usage of Memorystore for Redis,
Memorystore for Redis Cluster, or Memorystore for Memcached instances
associated with the Cloud Billing account used to purchase the CUD,
with the exception of Memorystore for Redis M1 capacity tier instances
(less than 5 GB). For information on resources that are ineligible for
Memorystore CUDs, see Resources eligible for Memorystore for Redis CUDs .
Resources eligible for Memorystore for Redis CUDs
Memorystore for Redis committed use discounts automatically apply to your
spending on Memorystore for Redis, Memorystore for Redis Cluster, and
Memorystore for Memcached instances for your billing account. This flexibility
helps you achieve a high utilization rate of your commitment across regions and
projects without manual intervention, saving you time and money.
Memorystore for Redis CUDs don't apply to your spending on
Cloud Storage storage, backup, outbound data transfer, or
Memorystore for Redis M1 capacity tier instances (fewer than 5 GB).
For a list of applicable SKUs, see Memorystore for Redis CUD Eligible SKUs .
Supported regions
Committed use discounts can be used for instances in all supported Memorystore for Redis regions .
Purchase a Memorystore for Redis CUD
After your purchase a CUD, you can't cancel your commitment. Make sure the
size and duration of your commitment aligns with both your historical and your
expected minimum expenditure on Memorystore for Redis capacity. For more
information, see
Canceling commitments .
To purchase or manage Memorystore for Redis committed use discounts for your
Cloud Billing account, follow the instructions at
Purchasing spend-based
commitments .
An example Memorystore for Redis CUD scenario
Your commitment should represent your expected minimum hourly
expenditure on Memorystore for Redis capacity across your projects
over the next one or three years.
As an example, say that you have a 200 GB Standard Tier Memorystore for Redis
instance with no read replicas in the us-central1 region.
From the pricing page ,
you can calculate the approximate hourly one-year commitment cost, as follows:
Expenditure in us-central1 : 200 GB * $0.024 per GB per hour =
$4.80 per hour
If you expect to spend that minimum of $4.80 per hour continuously for
the next year or more, then you can make a commitment for that amount.
When purchasing that CUD, you would enter " $4.80 " as
the hourly on-demand commitment amount.
In the legacy CUDs program, your commitment amount is the on-demand price instead. For more
information about the differences between the legacy and new spend-based CUDs program, see
Spend-based CUDs program improvements .
If, on the other hand, you expect to scale down the capacity
occasionally, you can make a commitment for a lower amount. Any
expenditure greater than that limit is charged at the on-demand rate.
As a basis for comparison, compute the on-demand cost
of Memorystore for Redis capacity, without the application of any commitment
discounts:
Monthly cost based on on-demand pricing: $6.00 per hour * 730 hours =
$4,380 per month
From here, you can calculate the monthly costs and savings you would see
under a 1-year CUD, applying its 20% discount, compared to a year of
paying the full on-demand rates:
Monthly cost of a 1-year, $6.00/hour commitment: ($6.00 per hour - 20%
discount) * 730 hours = $3,504 per month
Total savings per month: $4,380 - $3,504 = $876
Total savings with a 1-year, $6.00/hour commitment: $876 per month * 12
months = $10,512
You can apply similar math to calculating the costs and savings of a
3-year CUD, with its 40% discount compared to on-demand rates:
Monthly cost of a 3-year, $6.00/hour commitment: ($6.00 per hour - 40%
discount) * 730 hours = $2,628 per month
Total savings per month: $4,380 - $2,628 = $1,752
Total savings with a 3-year, $6.00/hour commitment: $1,752 per month * 36
months = $63,072
As you can see, a commitment that covers your expected minimum
Memorystore for Redis usage over the years to come can lead to significant
savings. Read on for our recommendations on choosing the right CUD size
for your Memorystore for Redis projects.
Recommendations for choosing a commitment
When considering the purchase of Memorystore for Redis CUDs, keep in mind
the following:
Projects : Determine the consistent baseline expenditure per
project while calculating total commitment. Consider that production
loads usually run 100% of the time, while development or staging
environments might run intermittently.
Resources : If you frequently scale your resources up or
down, consider purchasing CUDs only for their baseline predictable usage.
If you have instances that you run only for bursts or brief durations, exclude
them from your calculations.
Your commitment fee applies to every hour during the term of the
commitment, regardless of actual usage. Choose your CUD's commitment
amount carefully, based on both your historical Memorystore for Redis usage
and your future expectations. As long as your use of Memorystore for Redis
capacity stays higher than your committed expenditure level, you will
enjoy the maximum possible discount for the length of that commitment.
