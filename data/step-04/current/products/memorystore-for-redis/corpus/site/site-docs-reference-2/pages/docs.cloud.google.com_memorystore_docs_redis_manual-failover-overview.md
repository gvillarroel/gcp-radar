About manual failover
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page gives an overview of manual failover for Memorystore for Redis. To
learn how to perform a failover, see Initiating a manual failover .
What is a manual failover?
A standard tier Memorystore for Redis instance uses a replica node to back up
the primary node. A normal failover occurs when the primary node becomes
unhealthy, causing the replica to be designated as the new primary. A manual
failover differs from a normal failover because you initiate it yourself. For
more information on how Memorystore for Redis replication works, see High availability .
Why initiate a manual failover?
Initiating a manual failover allows you to test how your application responds to
a failover. This knowledge can ensure a smoother failover process if an
unexpected failover occurs later on.
Optional data protection mode
The two available data protection modes are:
limited-data-loss mode (default).
force-data-loss mode.
To set the data protection mode, use one of the following commands:
gcloud redis instances failover INSTANCE_NAME --data-protection-mode=limited-data-loss
or
gcloud redis instances failover INSTANCE_NAME --data-protection-mode=force-data-loss
How data protection modes work
The limited-data-loss mode minimizes data loss by verifying that the
difference in data between the primary and replica is below 30 MB before
initiating the failover. The offset on the primary is incremented for each byte
of data that must be synchronized to its replicas. In the limited-data-loss
mode, the failover will abort if the greatest offset delta between the primary
and each replica is 30MB or greater. If you can tolerate more data loss and want
to aggressively execute the failover, try setting the data protection mode to
force-data-loss .
The force-data-loss mode employs a chain of failover strategies to
aggressively execute the failover. It does not check the offset delta between
the primary and replicas before initiating the failover; you can potentially
lose more than 30MB of data changes.
Bytes pending replication metric
The bytes pending replication metric tells you how many remaining bytes the
replica needs to copy before the primary is fully backed up. You may observe
an increase in bytes pending as the primary replicates to the replica during
a failover. If the failover is triggered by hardware error, you may observe empty in bytes pending replication as the offset value could not be obtained until the new replica repaired from host error.
You can access this
metric in the Google Cloud console on the instance details page. To view the
instance details page, click the instance id in your project's instances list
page.
Alternatively, access the Metrics Explorer for your
project, and search for the redis.googlapis.com/replication/offset_diff
metric.
When to run a manual failover
Manual failovers using the default limited-data-loss protection mode only
succeed if the bytes pending replication metric is less than 30MB. If you
want to run a manual failover with bytes pending replication higher than
30MB, use the force-data-loss protection mode.
If you are trying to preserve as much data as possible, temporarily stop your
application from writing to the Redis instance, and wait to run your manual
failover until the bytes pending replication metric is as low as you deem
acceptable.
Potential issues blocking a manual failover
Running a manual failover on a Basic Tier instance does not work because Basic
Tier instances do not have replicas to which the primary can failover.
If your Redis instance is unhealthy, then a limited-data-loss manual failover
operation fails because it is blocked for data-loss minimization.
If you are running a Lua script that is executing indefinitely, then you must
use force-data-loss to initiate a failover. In this situation a
limited-data-loss failover operation will not complete successfully.
If your instance has incomplete operations pending, such as scaling or
updating, the manual failover operation is blocked. You must wait until your
instance is in the READY state to run a manual failover.
Client application connection
When your primary node fails over to the replica, existing connections to
Memorystore for Redis are dropped. However, on reconnect, your application is
automatically redirected to the new primary node using the same connection string
or IP address.
Verifying a manual failover
You can verify the success of a manual failover operation with the
Google Cloud console or gcloud .
Google Cloud console verification
Before you start a manual failover, go to the Memorystore for Redis instances
list page ,
and click the name of your instance.
Then, in the Configuration tab, next to Primary Location , view which zone
your primary node is in. Make a note of the zone. Check this page again when you
complete your manual failover to confirm that the primary node switched zones.
Cloud Monitoring verification
To view the metrics for a monitored resource by using the
Metrics Explorer, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
leaderboard Metrics explorer page:
Go to Metrics explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
In the toolbar of the Google Cloud console, select your Google Cloud project.
For App Hub configurations, select the
App Hub host project or the app-enabled folder's management project.
In the Metric element, expand the Select a metric menu,
enter Node role
in the filter bar, and then use the submenus to select a specific resource type and metric:
In the Active resources menu, select Cloud Memorystore Redis .
In the Active metric categories menu, select replication .
In the Active metrics menu, select Node role .
Click Apply .
To add filters, which remove time series from the query results, use the
Filter element .
To combine time series, use the menus on the
Aggregation element .
For example, to display the CPU utilization for your VMs, based on their zone, set the
first menu to Mean and the second menu to zone .
All time series are displayed when the first menu of the Aggregation element is set
to Unaggregated . The default settings for the Aggregation element
are determined by the metric type you selected.
For quota and other metrics that report one sample per day, do the following:
In the Display pane,
set the Widget type to Stacked bar chart .
Set the time period to at least one week.
The Cloud Monitoring chart represents the primary and replica nodes with two
lines. When a node's line has a value of zero on the chart, it is the replica
node. When a node's line has a value of one on the chart, it is the primary node.
The chart represents a failover by showing how the lines switch from one to
zero, and zero to one, respectively.
gcloud verification
Before you initiate a manual failover, use the following command to check which
zone your primary node is in:
gcloud redis instances describe [INSTANCE_ID] --region=[REGION]
Your primary node is in the zone labeled currentLocationId . Make a note of the
zone.
After you complete a manual failover, you can confirm that your primary node
switched to a new zone by running the gcloud redis instances describe command
again and checking that the currentLocationId changed zones.
Additionally, the locationId label tells you the zone in which you originally
provisioned your primary node. The alternativeLocationId label tells you the
zone in which system originally provisioned your replica node. Each time a
failover occurs the primary and replica switch between these two zones. However,
the zones associated with locationId and alternativeLocationId do not
change.
