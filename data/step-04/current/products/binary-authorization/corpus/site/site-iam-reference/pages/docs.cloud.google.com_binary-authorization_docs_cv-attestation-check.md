Required roles
This section shows you how to set roles for this check.
Overview
If you run all of the products that are mentioned in this guide in the same
project, you don't need to set any permissions. Binary Authorization
configures the roles correctly when you enable it. If you run the products in
different projects, you must set roles as described in this section.
To ensure that the Binary Authorization Service Agent in each project has the necessary
permissions to evaluate the CV simple signing attestation check,
ask your administrator to grant the
following IAM roles to the Binary Authorization Service Agent in each project:
Important: You must grant these roles
to the Binary Authorization Service Agent in each project, not to your user account. Failure to grant the roles to the correct principal might result in permission errors.
If your cluster project is different from the policy project:
Binary Authorization Policy Evaluator ( roles/binaryauthorization.policyEvaluator )
on the cluster project Binary Authorization Service Agent, for it to access the policy project
If your attestation project is different from your policy project:
Container Analysis Occurrences Viewer ( roles/containeranalysis.occurrences.viewer )
on the policy project Binary Authorization Service Agent, for it to access the attestation project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Your administrator might also be able to give the Binary Authorization Service Agent in each project
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Grant roles using the gcloud CLI
To ensure that the Binary Authorization Service Agent in each project has the
necessary permissions to evaluate the CV simple signing
attestation check, grant the Binary Authorization Service Agent in each project
the following IAM roles:
Grant permission for the cluster project's Binary Authorization Service
Agent to access the policy in the policy project.
Get the cluster project's Binary Authorization service agent:
PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects list --filter = "projectId: CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID " \
--format = "value(PROJECT_NUMBER)" )
CLUSTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT = "service- $PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-binaryauthorization.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
Replace CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID with the project ID
of the cluster.
Allow CV to evaluate the policy on the cluster:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding POLICY_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: $CLUSTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--role = 'roles/binaryauthorization.policyEvaluator'
Replace POLICY_PROJECT_ID with the ID of the
project that contains your policy.
Allow the policy project Binary Authorization Service Agent to access the
attestations in your attestation project:
Obtain the policy project's Binary Authorization service agent:
PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects list \
--filter = "projectId: POLICY_PROJECT_ID " \
--format = "value(PROJECT_NUMBER)" )
SERVICE_ACCOUNT = "service- $PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-binaryauthorization.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
Replace POLICY_PROJECT_ID with the ID of the
project that contains your policy.
Grant the role:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: $SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--role = 'roles/containeranalysis.occurrences.viewer'
Replace ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID with the ID of the
project that contains your attestations.
Create a key pair
In this section, you create an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
asymmetric key pair.
You use the private key to sign the image, which creates the attestation. You
include the public key in a platform policy. When CV checks the
attestation, it uses the public key to verify the attestation.
You can use either Cloud Key Management Service or local keys,
but we recommend that you use Cloud KMS keys for production.
PKIX Cloud KMS
To create the key pair in Cloud KMS, do the following:
Set up environment variables needed to create the key pair. To do so,
we recommend that you fill in the placeholders in the following command,
and then run the command.
KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID = KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID
KMS_KEYRING_NAME = KMS_KEYRING_NAME
KMS_KEY_NAME = KMS_KEY_NAME
KMS_KEY_LOCATION = global
KMS_KEY_PURPOSE = asymmetric-signing
KMS_KEY_ALGORITHM = ec-sign-p256-sha256
KMS_PROTECTION_LEVEL = software
KMS_KEY_VERSION = 1
KEY_FILE = KEY_FILE
Replace the following:
KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID : your project ID
KMS_KEYRING_NAME : a name for your
Cloud KMS key ring
KMS_KEY_NAME : a name for your Cloud KMS
key
KEY_FILE : a local path to save your
Cloud KMS key
Create the key ring:
gcloud kms keyrings create ${ KMS_KEYRING_NAME } \
--location = ${ KMS_KEY_LOCATION } \
--project = ${ KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID }
Create the key:
gcloud kms keys create ${ KMS_KEY_NAME } \
--location = ${ KMS_KEY_LOCATION } \
--keyring = ${ KMS_KEYRING_NAME } \
--purpose = ${ KMS_KEY_PURPOSE } \
--default-algorithm = ${ KMS_KEY_ALGORITHM } \
--protection-level = ${ KMS_PROTECTION_LEVEL } \
--project = ${ KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID }
Export the public key material to a file:
gcloud kms keys versions get-public-key ${ KMS_KEY_VERSION } \
--key = ${ KMS_KEY_NAME } \
--keyring = ${ KMS_KEYRING_NAME } \
--location = ${ KMS_KEY_LOCATION } \
--output-file = ${ KEY_FILE } \
--project = ${ KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID }
Local key
Warning: We strongly recommend against using locally generated key pairs in production environments as they present a security risk. We recommend that you instead use Cloud Key Management Service. This example is provided for illustrative purposes only.
To create the key pair locally, do the following:
Create the private key:
PRIVATE_KEY_FILE = "/tmp/ec_private.pem"
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ${ PRIVATE_KEY_FILE }
Get the public key from the private key:
PUBLIC_KEY_FILE = "/tmp/ec_public.pem"
openssl ec -in ${ PRIVATE_KEY_FILE } -pubout -out ${ PUBLIC_KEY_FILE }
Create a platform policy
To create a CV platform policy with a simple signing
attestation check, do the following:
Create the simple signing attestation check platform policy YAML file:
PKIX Cloud KMS
cat > /tmp/my-policy.yaml << EOF
gkePolicy:
checkSets:
- checks:
- simpleSigningAttestationCheck:
containerAnalysisAttestationProjects:

EOF
Replace ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID with the ID of the
project that stores attestations that are created using this
Cloud KMS key.
Local key
cat > /tmp/my-policy.yaml <<EOF

Replace the following:
ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project
that stores attestations that are created using your local key
PUBLIC_KEY_ID : an ID that uniquely identifies
your local key
Create the platform policy:
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:

Create the Artifact Analysis note
In this section, you create an example Artifact Analysis
note to link
attestations. To create the note, do the following:
Create the note variables:
NOTE_PROJECT_ID = NOTE_PROJECT_ID
NOTE_ID = "test-note"
NOTE_URI = "projects/ ${ NOTE_PROJECT_ID } /notes/ ${ NOTE_ID } "
DESCRIPTION = "CV test note"
Replace NOTE_PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that
contains the note.
Create the note content file:
cat > /tmp/note_payload.json << EOM
{
"name" : " ${ NOTE_URI } " ,
"attestation" : {
"hint" : {
"human_readable_name" : " ${ DESCRIPTION } "
}
}
}
EOM
Create the note:
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "x-goog-user-project: ${ NOTE_PROJECT_ID } " \
--data-binary @/tmp/note_payload.json "https://containeranalysis.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ ${ NOTE_PROJECT_ID } /notes/?noteId= ${ NOTE_ID } "
Replace NOTE_PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that
contains the note
Caution: Binary Authorization doesn't support Artifact Analysis regional
storage or regional
endpoints . We recommend that you use the
Artifact Analysis global API endpoint ( https://containeranalysis.googleapis.com/ ).
Optional: To verify that you created the note:
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "x-goog-user-project: NOTE_PROJECT_ID " \
"https://containeranalysis.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ NOTE_PROJECT_ID /notes/"
Replace NOTE_PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project
that contains the note.
Test CV
In this section, you test CV by deploying the image for which you
created an attestation. In this case, the CV simple signing
attestation check verifies the attestation and produces no log entry.
You then attempt to deploy a different image that has no attestation. In this
case, the CV check can't find the attestation and logs the
violation to Cloud Logging.
To create the variables you use to test CV, run the following
commands:
IMAGE_PATH = "us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app"
IMAGE_DIGEST = "sha256:37e5287945774f27b418ce567cd77f4bbc9ef44a1bcd1a2312369f31f9cce567"
IMAGE_TO_ATTEST = " ${ IMAGE_PATH } @ ${ IMAGE_DIGEST } "
Create an attestation
To satisfy the simple signing attestation check, the image needs a valid
attestation.
You can create an attestation using the gcloud CLI or the REST API.
PKIX Cloud KMS
gcloud
To create an attestation using the gcloud CLI, do the following:
Sign the image and create the attestation using Pre-Authentication Encoding (PAE)
(recommended):
gcloud beta container binauthz attestations sign-and-create \
--artifact-url = ${ IMAGE_TO_ATTEST } \
--keyversion = ${ KMS_KEY_VERSION } \
--keyversion-key = ${ KMS_KEY_NAME } \
--keyversion-keyring = ${ KMS_KEYRING_NAME } \
--keyversion-location = ${ KMS_KEY_LOCATION } \
--note = ${ NOTE_URI } \
--pae-encode-payload \
--dsse-type = DSSE_TYPE
Replace DSSE_TYPE with the DSSE type for PAE encoding.
The flag defaults to application/vnd.dev.cosign.simplesigning.v1+json .
REST API
To create an attestation using the REST API, do the following:
Create a signature payload file:
cat > /tmp/generated_payload.json << EOM
{
"critical" : {
"identity" : {
"docker-reference" : " ${ IMAGE_PATH } "
} ,
"image" : {
"docker-manifest-digest" : " ${ IMAGE_DIGEST } "
} ,
"type" : "Google Cloud BinAuthz container signature"
}
}
EOM
Sign the payload:
gcloud kms asymmetric-sign \
--version = ${ KMS_KEY_VERSION } \
--key = ${ KMS_KEY_NAME } \
--keyring = ${ KMS_KEYRING_NAME } \
--location = ${ KMS_KEY_LOCATION } \
--digest-algorithm = sha256 \
--input-file = /tmp/generated_payload.json \
--signature-file = /tmp/ec_signature \
--project = ${ KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID }
Create the attestation content:
cat > /tmp/attestation.json
Create the attestation:
curl -X POST "https://containeranalysis.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${NOTE_PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: ${NOTE_PROJECT_ID}" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
--data-binary @/tmp/attestation.json
Replace NOTE_PROJECT_ID with the ID of the
project that contains the note.

-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
--data-binary @/tmp/attestation.json
Deploy the image that has an attestation
To deploy an image for which an attestation was created, do the following:
Configure kubectl :
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your
cluster
LOCATION : the cluster location
CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID : the cluster project ID
Deploy a service and check the deployment against the Binary Authorization
policy:
kubectl run hello-app-with-attestation --image = $IMAGE_PATH @ $IMAGE_DIGEST
The Pod was deployed. Because the image has an attestation,
CV doesn't produce log entries related to this Pod.
Deploy an image without an attestation
In this section, you deploy an image that doesn't have an associated
attestation.
Because the policy requires attestations and this image doesn't have one,
CV regularly logs the violation while the container is running.
To deploy the image, run the following command:
kubectl run hello-app-without-attestation \
--image = $IMAGE_PATH @ $IMAGE_DIGEST
The Pod was deployed. Because the image doesn't have an attestation,
CV produces log entries while the Pod is running.
View logs for CV entries
You can search Cloud Logging entries to find CV configuration errors
and CV platform policy validation violations .
CV logs errors and violations to Cloud Logging
within 24 hours. You can usually see entries within a few hours.
View CV configuration error logs
To view CV configuration error logs, run the following command:
gcloud logging read \
--order = "desc" \
--freshness = 7d \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID \
'logName:"binaryauthorization.googleapis.com%2Fcontinuous_validation" "configErrorEvent"'
The following output shows a configuration error in which a CV
platform policy isn't found:
{
"insertId": "141d4f10-72ea-4a43-b3ec-a03da623de42",
"jsonPayload": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.binaryauthorization.v1beta1.ContinuousValidationEvent",

}
},
"resource": {

"receiveTimestamp": "2024-05-28T16:30:56.304108670Z"
}
View CV platform policy validation violations
If no images violate the platform policies that you have enabled, no entries
appear in the logs.
To view CV log entries for the last seven days, run the following
command:
gcloud logging read \
--order = "desc" \
--freshness = 7d \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID \
'logName:"binaryauthorization.googleapis.com%2Fcontinuous_validation" "policyName"'
Replace CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID with the cluster project ID.
Check types
CV logs check violation information to checkResults . In the
entry, the value checkType indicates the check. The values for each check are
as follows:
ImageFreshnessCheck
SigstoreSignatureCheck
SimpleSigningAttestationCheck
SlsaCheck
TrustedDirectoryCheck
VulnerabilityCheck
Example log
The following example CV Logging entry describes
a non-conformant image that violates a trusted directory check :
{

Clean up
This section describes how to clean up the CV monitoring you
configured earlier in this guide.
You can disable CV monitoring or both Binary Authorization
and CV in your cluster.
Disable Binary Authorization in a cluster
To disable both CV and Binary Authorization enforcement in your
cluster, run the following command:
gcloud beta container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--binauthz-evaluation-mode = DISABLED \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster
LOCATION : the cluster location
CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID : the cluster project ID
Disable check-based policy monitoring in a cluster
To disable CV with check-based policies in the cluster, and
re-enable enforcement using the Binary Authorization enforcement policy, run
the following command:
gcloud beta container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--binauthz-evaluation-mode = PROJECT_SINGLETON_POLICY_ENFORCE \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = " CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID "
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster
LOCATION : the cluster location
CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID : the cluster project ID
Note that --binauthz-evaluation-mode=PROJECT_SINGLETON_POLICY_ENFORCE is
equivalent to the older flag --enable-binauthz .
Delete the policy
To delete the policy, run the following command. It is not necessary to delete
the check-based platform policy to disable check-based policy auditing.
gcloud beta container binauthz policy delete POLICY_ID \
--platform = gke \
--project = " POLICY_PROJECT_ID "
Replace the following:
POLICY_ID : the ID of the policy
POLICY_PROJECT_ID : the policy project ID
What's next
Use the image freshness check
Use the simple signing attestation check
Use the Sigstore signature check
Use the SLSA check
Use the trusted directory check
Use the vulnerability check
