View audit logs for GKE
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to view information about deployment status and policy
enforcement in Cloud Audit Logs .
To learn more about Cloud Audit Logs user interface terminology used in
this page, see Viewing logs .
You can assess your application security posture, including Binary Authorization
policy enforcement across interdependent Google Cloud products in a single
dashboard. To learn more, see
Security monitoring .
Overview
When you use Binary Authorization to deploy a container image to Google Kubernetes Engine
(GKE), GKE writes details about
the deployment to the audit logs in Google Cloud Observability. These audit log
entries include enforcement status messages . You can view these log entries
in the Google Cloud console or at the command line using the
gcloud logging read command.
For the searches later in this guide, you access Cloud Audit Logs and select the
project with the events you want to view.
For general access to Cloud Audit Logs, do the following:
Go to the Google Cloud Observability Logging > Logs (Logs Explorer) page in the
Google Cloud console:
Go to Logs Explorer
Choose the Google Cloud project for which you want to view Cloud Audit Logs.
Enforcement status messages
GKE writes messages to the audit log for the following
enforcement conditions:
Blocked deployment : Deployment was blocked due to Binary Authorization policy.
Breakglass event : Deployment bypassed policy check using breakglass
mechanism. For more information, see Using breakglass .
Fail open : Deployment was allowed because Binary Authorization backend was
unavailable.
Dry run : Deployment allowed with policy violations because dry run mode
was set in the Binary Authorization policy.
Blocked deployment events in Cloud Audit Logs
When a container image is blocked because it violates a Binary Authorization
policy, you can find the blocked-deployment events in Cloud Audit Logs.
Query Cloud Audit Logs for blocked deployment events
This section describes how to query Cloud Audit Logs for blocked deployment
events.
Logs Explorer
To view blocked deployment events in the Cloud Audit Logs Logs Explorer, do
the following:
Go to the Logs Explorer page .
Enter the following query in the search-query box:
resource . type = "k8s_cluster"
logName : "cloudaudit.googleapis.com %2F activity"
( protoPayload . methodName = "io.k8s.core.v1.pods.create" OR
protoPayload . methodName = "io.k8s.core.v1.pods.update" )
protoPayload . response . status = "Failure"
( protoPayload . response . reason = "VIOLATES_POLICY" OR
protoPayload . response . reason = "Forbidden" )
Select the time range in the time-range selector .
gcloud
To view policy violation events from the past week in Cloud Audit Logs using
the Google Cloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud logging read --order = "desc" --freshness = 7d \
'resource.type="k8s_cluster"
logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"
(protoPayload.methodName="io.k8s.core.v1.pods.create" OR
protoPayload.methodName="io.k8s.core.v1.pods.update")
protoPayload.response.status="Failure"
(protoPayload.response.reason="VIOLATES_POLICY" OR
protoPayload.response.reason="Forbidden")'
Note: For Kubernetes master versions 1.18.15 and later, 1.19.7 and later, and
1.20.2 and later, protoPayload.response.reason is set to VIOLATES_POLICY .
Breakglass events in Cloud Audit Logs
Binary Authorization enables you to override the policy using a
breakglass
label in the Pod specification. When images are deployed with breakglass,
Binary Authorization logs breakglass events in Cloud Audit Logs. The
following section describes how you can query for these events.
Query Cloud Audit Logs for pods with breakglass specified
Logs Explorer
To view breakglass events in the Cloud Audit Logs Logs Explorer, do the
following:
Go to the Logs Explorer page .
Enter the following in the search-query box:
resource . type = "k8s_cluster"
logName : "cloudaudit.googleapis.com %2F activity"
( protoPayload . methodName = "io.k8s.core.v1.pods.create" OR
protoPayload . methodName = "io.k8s.core.v1.pods.update" )
"image-policy.k8s.io/break-glass"
Select the time range in the time-range selector .
gcloud
To view breakglass events from the past week in Cloud Audit Logs using the
the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud logging read --order = "desc" --freshness = 7d \
'resource.type="k8s_cluster" AND
logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity" AND
(protoPayload.methodName="io.k8s.core.v1.pods.create" OR
protoPayload.methodName="io.k8s.core.v1.pods.update") AND
"image-policy.k8s.io/break-glass"'
Fail open events in Cloud Audit Logs
Fail open occurs when a container image deployment is attempted,
Binary Authorization enforcement is unavailable or times out, and the container
image is allowed to deploy.
In this case, the verification result is unknown and a log entry is recorded.
Query Cloud Audit Logs fail open events
Logs Explorer
To view fail open events in the Cloud Audit Logs Logs Explorer, do the
following:
Go to the Logs Explorer page .
Enter the following in the search-query box:
resource . type = "k8s_cluster"
logName : "cloudaudit.googleapis.com %2F activity"
( protoPayload . methodName = "io.k8s.core.v1.pods.create" OR
protoPayload . methodName = "io.k8s.core.v1.pods.update" )
( "image-policy.k8s.io/failed-open" OR
"imagepolicywebhook.image-policy.k8s.io/failed-open" OR
"failed-open.validating.webhook.admission.k8s.io" )
Select the time range in the time-range selector .
gcloud
To view fail open events from the past week in Cloud Audit Logs using
the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud logging read --order = "desc" --freshness = 7d \
'resource.type="k8s_cluster"
logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"
(protoPayload.methodName="io.k8s.core.v1.pods.create" OR
protoPayload.methodName="io.k8s.core.v1.pods.update")
("image-policy.k8s.io/failed-open" OR
"imagepolicywebhook.image-policy.k8s.io/failed-open" OR
"failed-open.validating.webhook.admission.k8s.io")'
Dry run events in Cloud Audit Logs
Dry run mode is an enforcement mode in a policy
that enables non-conformant images to be deployed, but writes details about the
deployment to the audit log. Dry run mode allows you to test a policy in your
production environment before it goes into effect.
When a container image fails to pass the required checks in a policy, but is
permitted to be deployed by dry run mode, Cloud Audit Logs contains
imagepolicywebhook.image-policy.k8s.io/dry-run: "true" .
Query Cloud Audit Logs for dry run events
Logs Explorer
To view dry run events in the Cloud Audit Logs Logs Explorer, do the
following:
Go to the Logs Explorer page .
Enter the following in the search-query box:
resource . type = "k8s_cluster"
logName : "cloudaudit.googleapis.com %2F activity"
( protoPayload . methodName = "io.k8s.core.v1.pods.create" OR
protoPayload . methodName = "io.k8s.core.v1.pods.update" )
labels . "imagepolicywebhook.image-policy.k8s.io/dry-run" = "true"
Select the time range in the time-range selector .
gcloud
To view dry run deployment events from the past week in Cloud Audit Logs using
the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud logging read --order = "desc" --freshness = 7d \
'labels."imagepolicywebhook.image-policy.k8s.io/dry-run"="true"'
