Configure a multi-project setup
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial describes how to use Binary Authorization in a multi-project
configuration. For a simpler single-project configuration, see
Get started using the Google Cloud CLI (GKE) .
To establish separation of duties , you can
setup Binary Authorization in a multiple-project configuration. The purpose of
each project is discussed later in this tutorial.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you perform the following tasks:
Set up a different project for deployment (GKE), attestor,
and attestation management, to support
separation of duties .
Configure the default rule of your
Binary Authorization policy to require attestations.
Create Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509) (PKIX) key pair to sign, and later verify,
the attestation.
Create an attestor that the Binary Authorization enforcer uses to verify the
attestation.
Sign an example image, creating an attestation.
Test the policy by deploying the example image.
You must configure each project's appropriate access control through
Identity and Access Management (IAM).
For additional security, you can use VPC Service Controls to help protect the
resources you create in this tutorial. For more information, see
Securing with VPC Service Controls .
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Artifact Registry
Binary Authorization
GKE
Optional: Cloud Key Management Service
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
Before you begin
Note: For this configuration, you set up three projects.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

Install kubectl for interacting with GKE.
Set up the deployer project
The deployer project manages the Google Kubernetes Engine
(GKE) clusters, where you deploy images, and the
Binary Authorization policy that Binary Authorization
enforces at deploy time. You can have more than one deployer project, depending
on the size, complexity, and other requirements of your environment.
Note: To use the same attestor with multiple deployer projects, repeat the steps
below, substituting DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID with the ID of each deployer
project.
To set up the deployer project:
Create the project and enable billing in Google Cloud console if you have not
already done so.
Identity and Access Management note: The deployer project contains your
GKE cluster. The Identity and Access Management configuration for
this project should reflect that.
Set environment variables to store the Google Cloud project and number:
DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID= DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID
Replace DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID with the Google Cloud project
ID.
DEPLOYER_PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe "${DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID}" \
--format="value(projectNumber)")
Enable APIs:
Artifact Registry
gcloud --project=${DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID} \
services enable\
container.googleapis.com\
artifactregistry.googleapis.com\
binaryauthorization.googleapis.com
Get the deployer project service account name:
DEPLOYER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="service-${DEPLOYER_PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-binaryauthorization.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
You use the service account name in a later step when you configure
permissions on the Artifact Analysis note associated with your attestor.
Set up the attestor project
An attestor project stores the attestors that can
verify that an image is ready for deployment. Often, you have a single attestor
project that acts as a centralized store for information about trusted parties
in the authorization process. This allows you to centrally manage security keys
required to verify the identity of attestors and to restrict access to only
those parties who administer them.
To set up the attestor project:
Create the project and enable billing in Google Cloud console if you have not
already done so.
Identity and Access Management note: Because the this project contains your attestors,
only security personnel should have write access.
Set environment variables to store the project ID and number:
ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID= ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID
Replace ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID with the attestor project ID.
ATTESTOR_PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe "${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID}" \
--format="value(projectNumber)")
Enable the Artifact Analysis and Binary Authorization APIs:
gcloud services --project=${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID} \
enable containeranalysis.googleapis.com \
binaryauthorization.googleapis.com
Get the attestor project service account name:
ATTESTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="service-${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-binaryauthorization.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
You use the service account name in a later step when you configure
permissions on the Artifact Analysis note associated with your attestor.
Set up the attestations project
An attestation project is one that stores
attestations that attestors make when they verify
an image. A separate attestation project allows you to organize and inspect
statements about software readiness more easily.
Create the project and enable billing in Google Cloud console if you have not
already done so.
Identity and Access Management note: All roles involved in binary authorization should have
read access to the Artifact Analysis Notes and Occurrences in this project,
however only attestation managers need to have write access.
Set an environment variable to store the project name:
ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID= ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID
Replace ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID with the attestation project ID.
Enable the Artifact Analysis and Binary Authorization APIs:
gcloud services --project=${ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID} \
enable containeranalysis.googleapis.com \
binaryauthorization.googleapis.com
Create a cluster
Now you can create a GKE cluster in the deployer project.
This is the cluster where you want your deployed container images to run. When
you create the cluster, you pass the --binauthz-evaluation-mode=PROJECT_SINGLETON_POLICY_ENFORCE flag to the
gcloud container clusters create command.
To create the cluster:
gcloud --project=${DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID} \
container clusters create \
--binauthz-evaluation-mode=PROJECT_SINGLETON_POLICY_ENFORCE \
--zone us-central1-a \
test-cluster
Here, you create a cluster named test-cluster in the
GKE zone us-central1-a .
You must also update the local kubeconfig file for your kubectl
installation. This provides the credentials and endpoint information required to
access the cluster in GKE.
To update the local kubeconfig file:
gcloud --project=${DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID} \
container clusters get-credentials \
--zone us-central1-a \
test-cluster
Create an attestor
An attestor is a party that is responsible for
attesting that a required process has completed before a container image can be
deployed. This party can be a human user or, more often, a machine process like
a build and test system, or your continuous integration (CI) and deployment
(CD) pipelines. You create attestors in your attestor project.
Creating an attestor requires you to:
Create a note in
Artifact Analysis to store
trusted metadata used in the authorization process
Create the attestor itself in the attestor project and associate the note
you created
Add an IAM role binding for the deployer project service account to the
attestor
Set permissions on the Artifact Analysis note
For this tutorial, you have one attestor named test-attestor and a Container
Analysis note named test-attestor-note . In a real-world scenario, you can have
any number of attestors, each one representing a party that participates in the
authorization process for the image.
Create the Artifact Analysis note
Set variables that store the name of your attestor and Artifact Analysis
note:
ATTESTOR_NAME= test-attestor
NOTE_ID= test-attestor-note
Replace:
test-attestor : attestor name of your choice.
test-attestor-note : attestor note name of your choice.
Create a JSON file in /tmp/note_payload.json that describes the Container
Analysis note:
cat > /tmp/note_payload.json
Create the note by sending an HTTP request to the Artifact Analysis REST
API:
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
--data-binary @/tmp/note_payload.json \
"https://containeranalysis.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID}/notes/?noteId=${NOTE_ID}"
Caution: Binary Authorization doesn't support Artifact Analysis regional
storage or regional
endpoints . We recommend that you use the
Artifact Analysis global API endpoint ( https://containeranalysis.googleapis.com/ ).
Verify that the note was created:
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
"https://containeranalysis.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID}/notes/${NOTE_ID}"
Create the attestor
Now, you can create the attestor:
Create the attestor in Binary Authorization:
gcloud --project=${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID} \
container binauthz attestors create ${ATTESTOR_NAME} \
--attestation-authority-note=${NOTE_ID} \
--attestation-authority-note-project=${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID}
Verify that the attestor was created:
gcloud --project=${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID} \
container binauthz attestors list
The attestor you created is not yet usable without an associated PKIX key pair,
which you create below .
Add an IAM role binding for the deployer project
You must add an IAM role binding for the deployer project to the attestor.
This is used by Binary Authorization when it evaluates a policy to determine
whether the project has permissions to access any associated attestations.
To add the IAM role binding:
gcloud --project ${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID} \
container binauthz attestors add-iam-policy-binding \
"projects/${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID}/attestors/${ATTESTOR_NAME}" \
--member="serviceAccount:${DEPLOYER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
--role=roles/binaryauthorization.attestorsVerifier
Set permissions on the Artifact Analysis note
You must also set permissions on the Artifact Analysis note you created
so that it is accessible to both the deployer project and the attestor project.
You do this by updating the IAM policy for the note to assign Viewer access
to the project service accounts.
Generate a JSON file that contains the information needed to set the IAM
policy on your note.
cat > /tmp/iam_request.json
Add the service account and requested access roles to the IAM policy for the
note you created:
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
--data-binary @/tmp/iam_request.json \
"https://containeranalysis.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID}/notes/${NOTE_ID}:setIamPolicy"
Caution: Binary Authorization doesn't support Artifact Analysis regional
storage or regional
endpoints . We recommend that you use the
Artifact Analysis global API endpoint ( https://containeranalysis.googleapis.com/ ).
Set up PKIX keys
Binary Authorization uses cryptographic keys to securely verify the identity of
attestors. This ensures that only verified parties can participate in the
authorization of a container image. The key pair consists of a private key,
which the attestor uses to digitally sign attestations, and a public key, which
you add to the attestor as stored by the Binary Authorization service.
In this tutorial, you use the recommended
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
to create the key pair. You can also use RSA or PGP keys for
signing. See Key purposes and algorithms for more
information on signing algorithms.
The asymmetric keys generated and stored by
Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) are PKIX-compliant. See
Creating attestors using the CLI for more
information on using PKIX keys and Cloud KMS.
Generate a key pair
A PKIX key pair consists of a private key,
which the signer uses to digitally sign attestations,
and a public key, which you add to the attestor. At deploy time,
Binary Authorization uses this public key to verify the attestation signed by the
private key.
Generate the private key:
To generate a new local asymmetric PKIX key pair and store it in a file:
PKIX (Cloud KMS)
This step shows how to perform an attestation using keys generated and
stored in Cloud Key Management Service .
Set up environment variables to store information about the key pair
as managed by Cloud KMS:
If you already have a key pair, you can set these environment
variables and skip the next step.
KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID= KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID
KMS_KEY_LOCATION= KMS_KEY_LOCATION
KMS_KEYRING_NAME= KMS_KEYRING_NAME
KMS_KEY_NAME= KMS_KEY_NAME
KMS_KEY_VERSION= KMS_KEY_VERSION
Replace the following:
KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where the
keys are stored
KMS_KEY_LOCATION : the location of the key
KMS_KEYRING_NAME : the name of the key ring
KMS_KEY_NAME : the name of the key
KMS_KEY_VERSION : the key version
[Optional] Set up a KMS key:
Note: You can skip these steps if you already have a KMS key.
Create a KMS key whose public key can be stored in an attestor.
This step also sets up environment variables you use below.
To create a key and set up the environment variables:
KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID=${PROJECT_ID}
KMS_KEYRING_NAME=my-binauthz-keyring
KMS_KEY_NAME=my-binauthz-kms-key-name
KMS_KEY_LOCATION=global
KMS_KEY_PURPOSE=asymmetric-signing
KMS_KEY_ALGORITHM=ec-sign-p256-sha256
KMS_PROTECTION_LEVEL=software
KMS_KEY_VERSION=1
Create a KMS key ring:
gcloud kms keyrings create ${KMS_KEYRING_NAME} \
--location ${KMS_KEY_LOCATION} \
--project ${KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID}
Create the key:
gcloud kms keys create ${KMS_KEY_NAME} \
--location ${KMS_KEY_LOCATION} \
--keyring ${KMS_KEYRING_NAME} \
--purpose ${KMS_KEY_PURPOSE} \
--default-algorithm ${KMS_KEY_ALGORITHM} \
--protection-level ${KMS_PROTECTION_LEVEL} \
--project ${KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID}
For more information on creating KMS keys, see
Create an asymmetric key .
Add the public key to the attestor:
gcloud --project="${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID}" \
container binauthz attestors public-keys add \
--attestor="${ATTESTOR_NAME}" \
--keyversion-project="${KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID}" \
--keyversion-location="${KMS_KEY_LOCATION}" \
--keyversion-keyring="${KMS_KEYRING_NAME}" \
--keyversion-key="${KMS_KEY_NAME}" \
--keyversion="${KMS_KEY_VERSION}"
PKIX (local key)
Warning: We strongly recommend against using locally generated key pairs in production environments as they present a security risk. We recommend that you instead use Cloud Key Management Service. This example is provided for illustrative purposes only.
To generate the private key, run the following commands:
PRIVATE_KEY_FILE="/tmp/ec_private.pem"
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ${PRIVATE_KEY_FILE}
PRIVATE_KEY_FILE is the name of the file that contains
the private key that is stored in the attestor.
Extract the public key from the private key and store it in a file:
PUBLIC_KEY_FILE="/tmp/ec_public.pem"
openssl ec -in ${PRIVATE_KEY_FILE} -pubout -out ${PUBLIC_KEY_FILE}
PUBLIC_KEY_FILE is the name of the file that contains the
public key that is stored in the attestor.
To add the public key you exported to the attestor, run the
following code.
gcloud --project="${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID}" \
container binauthz attestors public-keys add \
--attestor="${ATTESTOR_NAME}" \
--pkix-public-key-file=${PUBLIC_KEY_FILE} \
--pkix-public-key-algorithm=ecdsa-p256-sha256
Binary Authorization uses the public key in the attestor to verify the
attestation.
Configure the policy
Now, you can configure your policy in the deployer project. In this step, you
export the policy YAML file to your local system and modify the default rule
so that it requires an attestation by the attestor you defined above.
To configure the policy:
Create a new policy file that allows Google-maintained system images ,
sets the evaluationMode to
REQUIRE_ATTESTATION , and adds a node named
requireAttestationsBy
that references the attestor you created:
cat > /tmp/policy.yaml
Import the policy YAML file into Binary Authorization:
gcloud --project=${DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID} \
container binauthz policy import /tmp/policy.yaml
For more information on configuring a policy, see
Configuring a Policy Using the CLI .
Test the policy
In this tutorial, you create an attestation for example, public "Hello World!"
images from Artifact Registry. Initially, the enforcer blocks
the images from being deployed because the required attestation does not exist.
To try to deploy the image:
Artifact Registry
kubectl run hello-server --image us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0 --port 8080
Now, verify that the deployment was blocked by Binary Authorization:
kubectl get pods
The command prints the following message, which indicates that the image was not
deployed:
No resources found.
You can get further details about the deployment:
kubectl get event --template \
'{{range.items}}{{"\033[0;36m"}}{{.reason}}:{{"\033[0m"}}\{{.message}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
You see a response that resembles the following:
FailedCreate: Error creating: pods POD_NAME is forbidden: admission webhook "imagepolicywebhook.image-policy.k8s.io" denied the request: Image IMAGE_NAME denied by Binary Authorization default admission rule. Image IMAGE_NAME denied by attestor ATTESTOR_NAME : No attestations found
In this output:
POD_NAME : the name of the Pod.
IMAGE_NAME : the name of the image.
ATTESTOR_NAME : the name of the attestor.
Make sure to delete the deployment so you can continue to the next step:
kubectl delete deployment hello-server
Create an attestation
An attestation is a statement by an attestor that a
required process in your pipeline has been completed and that the container
image in question is authorized for deployment. The attestation itself is a
digitally signed record that contains the full path to a version of the image as
stored your container image registry, as well as the identity of the attestor.
In this tutorial, your attestation simply states that you authorize the image
for deployment. You create the attestation in the attestation project.
To create an attestation:
Set variables that store the registry path and digest of the image:
Artifact Registry
IMAGE_PATH="us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app"
IMAGE_DIGEST="sha256:37e5287945774f27b418ce567cd77f4bbc9ef44a1bcd1a2312369f31f9cce567"
IMAGE_TO_ATTEST=${IMAGE_PATH}@${IMAGE_DIGEST}
Create the attestation
PKIX Cloud KMS
To create the attestation using the Cloud KMS key, run the
following command:
gcloud beta container binauthz attestations sign-and-create \
--project = " ${ PROJECT_ID } " \
--artifact-url = " ${ IMAGE_TO_ATTEST } " \
--attestor = " ${ ATTESTOR_NAME } " \
--attestor-project = " ${ PROJECT_ID } " \
--keyversion-project = " ${ KMS_KEY_PROJECT_ID } " \
--keyversion-location = " ${ KMS_KEY_LOCATION } " \
--keyversion-keyring = " ${ KMS_KEYRING_NAME } " \
--keyversion-key = " ${ KMS_KEY_NAME } " \
--keyversion = " ${ KMS_KEY_VERSION } "
PKIX (local key)
To create the attestation using a local key, do the following:
Generate the attestation payload:
Note: In the following command, while an ${IMAGE_PATH} is required to
create the signature payload for the attestation, only the ${IMAGE_DIGEST}
is used at deploy time. This means you can deploy an identical container
image from multiple locations with the same attestation.
gcloud --project=${ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID} \
container binauthz create-signature-payload \
--artifact-url=${IMAGE_TO_ATTEST} > /tmp/generated_payload.json
The payload JSON file has the following contents:
Artifact Registry
{
"critical": {
"identity": {
"docker-reference": "us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app"
},
"image": {
"docker-manifest-digest": "sha256:37e5287945774f27b418ce567cd77f4bbc9ef44a1bcd1a2312369f31f9cce567"
},
"type": "Google cloud binauthz container signature"
}
}
Sign the payload.
If using local PKIX files, sign the payload with your local PKIX private key and output a signature
file:
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ${PRIVATE_KEY_FILE} /tmp/generated_payload.json > /tmp/ec_signature
The output file is a signed version of the payload JSON file
you created above.
Get the public key ID from the attestor.
You can view your public key ID at any time using the command:
gcloud container binauthz attestors describe ATTESTOR_NAME .
To save your public key ID in an environment variable, enter this
command:
PUBLIC_KEY_ID=$(gcloud container binauthz attestors describe ${ATTESTOR_NAME} \
--format='value(userOwnedGrafeasNote.publicKeys[0].id)' --project ${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID})
Create and validate the attestation:
gcloud container binauthz attestations create \
--project="${ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID}" \
--artifact-url="${IMAGE_TO_ATTEST}" \
--attestor="projects/${ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID}/attestors/${ATTESTOR_NAME}" \
--signature-file=/tmp/ec_signature \
--public-key-id="${PUBLIC_KEY_ID}" \
--validate
The validate flag checks that the attestation can be verified by the
attestor you configured in your policy.
Verify that the attestation was created:
gcloud --project=${ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID} \
container binauthz attestations list \
--attestor=$ATTESTOR_NAME --attestor-project=$ATTESTOR_PROJECT_ID
For more information on creating attestations, see
Creating Attestations .
Retest the policy
Test the policy by deploying a sample container image to the cluster.
This time, you must deploy the image using the digest rather than a tag like
1.0 or latest , as Binary Authorization uses the digest to look up
attestations. Here, Binary Authorization allows the image to be deployed because
the image has an associated attestation.
To deploy the image:
kubectl run hello-server --image ${IMAGE_TO_ATTEST} --port 8080
To verify that the image was deployed:
kubectl get pods
The command prints a message similar to the following, which indicates that
deployment was successful:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
hello-server-579859fb5b-h2k8s 1/1 Running 0 1m
Now that you have successfully deployed the container image and verified that
your setup is working, you can delete the cluster you created in
GKE:
gcloud --project=${DEPLOYER_PROJECT_ID} \
container clusters delete \
--zone=us-central1-a \
test-cluster
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the cluster that you created in GKE:
gcloud container clusters delete \
--zone=us-central1-a \
test-cluster
You can also delete Google Cloud projects that you created for this tutorial.
