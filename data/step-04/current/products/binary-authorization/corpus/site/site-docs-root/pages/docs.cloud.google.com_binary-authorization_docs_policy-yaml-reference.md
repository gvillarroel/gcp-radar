This page contains reference information for Binary Authorization
policies as specified in
YAML format. When you
configure a policy using the command-line interface ,
you edit a YAML-formatted file that complies with this specification. For
examples of policies in YAML format, see Example Policies .
Policy YAML files have the following format:
name : projects/<PROJECT_ID>/policy
admissionWhitelistPatterns :
- namePattern : < MATCHING_PATTERN >
- ...
globalPolicyEvaluationMode : < GLOBAL_EVAL_MODE >
defaultAdmissionRule :
< ADMISSION_RULE >
clusterAdmissionRules :
< CLUSTER_SPECIFIER > :
< ADMISSION_RULE >
...
Nodes
The YAML format has the following top-level nodes:
Node
Description
Required
name
Name of the policy.
Yes
admissionWhitelistPatterns
Specifies container images that are always allowed to be deployed.
No
globalPolicyEvaluationMode
Specifies whether to apply a system policy that exempts Google-owned
system images.
No
defaultAdmissionRule
The rule to use when no specific rule applies.
Yes
clusterAdmissionRules
Specifies rules that apply to specific clusters.
No
name
The name node contains the name of the policy in the following format:
name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /policy
where PROJECT_ID is the name of your Google Cloud
project where your policy is defined.
For example:
name : projects/example-project/policy
admissionWhitelistPatterns
Note: We don't recommend using admissionWhitelistPatterns to allowlist
Google-managed system images. Google-managed system images are allowed if
globalPolicyEvaluationMode is set to ENABLE (the default setting). See
globalPolicyEvaluationMode for details.
admissionWhitelistPatterns specifies an allowlist of container images that are
exempt from policy enforcement . You specify the
path to the images in Container Registry and Artifact Registry, another registry, or
a local reference in the namePattern subnode:
admissionWhitelistPatterns:
- namePattern: MATCHING_PATTERN
- ...
Replace MATCHING_PATTERN with either a path to a single image or
a matching pattern containing one of the wildcard symbols ( * , ** ).
Note that wildcards are valid only at the end of the pattern. For example,
gcr.io/my-project/nginx* is a valid pattern, but gcr.io/my-project/n*x
isn't. The * wildcard only matches images in the specified directory. For
example, gcr.io/my-project/nginx* matches gcr.io/my-project/nginx:latest ,
but not gcr.io/my-project/nginx-images/nginx . The ** wildcard matches images
in subdirectories. For example, the path gcr.io/my-project/nginx** matches
gcr.io/my-project/nginx-1.14.2/image:latest .
Caution: Be careful when using the ** wildcard with project IDs as doing so
also matches images in different projects. For example, the path
gcr.io/my-project** , allows images in both gcr.io/my-project/nginx and
gcr.io/my-project-exploit/nginx-exploit to be deployed.
The following example adds registries containing commonly used
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) images, an image located at
gcr.io/example-project/helloworld , and a local reference to an image, to the
list of exempt images for the policy:
admissionWhitelistPatterns:
- namePattern: gcr.io/google-containers/*
- namePattern: k8s.gcr.io/**
- namePattern: gke.gcr.io/**
- namePattern: gcr.io/gke-release/asm/*
- namePattern: gcr.io/stackdriver-agents/*
- namePattern: gcr.io/example-project/helloworld
- namePattern: loc-ref
Note: This example includes images GKE requires to start
a cluster. You must include them if globalPolicyEvaluationMode is disabled.
Allowlist patterns
Note: The same rules apply for local references to images.
To allowlist all container images whose registry location matches the specified
path:
admissionWhitelistPatterns:
...
- namePattern: gcr.io/example-project/*
To allowlist a specific image:
admissionWhitelistPatterns:
...
- namePattern: gcr.io/example-project/helloworld
To allowlist a currently-tagged version:
admissionWhitelistPatterns:
...
- namePattern: gcr.io/example-project/helloworld:latest
- namePattern: gcr.io/example-project/helloworld:my-tag
- namePattern: gcr.io/example-project/helloworld:v1.*
To allowlist a specific version of an image by its digest:
admissionWhitelistPatterns:
...
- namePattern: gcr.io/example-project/helloworld@sha256:77b0b75136b9bd0fd36fb50f4c92ae0dbdbbe164ab67885e736fa4374e0cbb8c
To allowlist images in subdirectories of a given path:
admissionWhitelistPatterns:
...
- namePattern: gcr.io/example-project/**
globalPolicyEvaluationMode
System policy evaluation mode
is a policy setting that causes Binary Authorization to evaluate a system policy
before evaluating the policy that you configure. The system policy is provided
by Google and exempts a list of Google-maintained system images from further
policy evaluation. When you have this setting enabled, images that are required
by GKE are not blocked by policy enforcement. The system
policy is evaluated prior to and in addition to user policy evaluation,
including admissionWhitelistPatterns .
To allow all Google-maintained system images, set the
globalPolicyEvaluationMode property to ENABLE :
globalPolicyEvaluationMode: ENABLE
To disable system policy evaluation mode:
globalPolicyEvaluationMode: DISABLE
Note: It is recommended that you leave globalPolicyEvaluationMode on its
default setting, ENABLE . For GKE to work properly, it needs to
run a number of system images in your cluster. When you enable
globalPolicyEvaluationMode , the Google-maintained allowlist of system images
is automatically updated with every GKE release. While you can
manage system images yourself by listing them in admissionWhitelistPatterns ,
updated system images might not be allowed to run if the allowlist is not kept
up to date. Note: If you disable globalPolicyEvaluationMode , the paths
gcr.io/google-containers/* , k8s.gcr.io/** , gke.gcr.io/* ,
gcr.io/gke-release/someproject/* , and gcr.io/stackdriver-agents/* must be
included in the admissionWhitelistPatterns allowlist, as they contain
Google Cloud resources required by GKE to start a cluster
successfully.
Additional image paths might be required in the future. Those paths would also
need to be included in the admissionWhitelistPatterns allowlist for
GKE clusters to run as expected.
defaultAdmissionRule
defaultAdmissionRule specifies the default rule
for the policy. The default rule defines the constraints that apply to all
non-exempt container images with the exception of those that have their own
cluster-specific rule. You specify the default rule using the
ADMISSION_RULE collection:
defaultAdmissionRule:
ADMISSION_RULE
The following example shows a default rule that allows only those container
images to be deployed which have been authorized by the specified
attestor . In the case that all required attestors have
not authorized the image, Binary Authorization blocks the deployment and writes
to the audit log.
defaultAdmissionRule:
evaluationMode: REQUIRE_ATTESTATION
enforcementMode: ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG
requireAttestationsBy:
- projects/example-project/attestors/secure-build
clusterAdmissionRules
clusterAdmissionRules declare
cluster-specific rules for the policy.
The constraints in these rules apply only to the specified cluster. If
Binary Authorization applies a cluster-specific rule to a deployment, the default
rule is not considered. As with default rules, you specify cluster-specific
rules using the
ADMISSION_RULE collection:
clusterAdmissionRules:
CLUSTER_SPECIFIER :
ADMISSION_RULE
where CLUSTER_SPECIFIER is the resource ID of the cluster to which
the rule applies in the format location.name (for example,
us-east1-a.prod-cluster ).
The following examples shows a cluster-specific rule that only allows those
container images to be deployed which have been authorized by the specified
attestors:
clusterAdmissionRules:
us-east1-a.prod-cluster:
evaluationMode: REQUIRE_ATTESTATION
enforcementMode: ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG
requireAttestationsBy:
- projects/example-project/attestors/secure-build
- projects/example-project/attestors/prod-qualified
Node collections
ADMISSION_RULE
ADMISSION_RULE is a collection of nodes that specify the constraints for the
rule in the following format:
evaluationMode: EVAL_MODE
enforcementMode: ENFORCEMENT_MODE
requireAttestationsBy:
- ATTESTOR
- ...
Both defaultAdmissionRule and clusterAdmissionRule reference this
collection.
evaluationMode
evaluationMode specifies the operation that Binary Authorization performs in
order to evaluate whether to deploy a container image. The possible values are:
ALWAYS_ALLOW : Always allow deployment of images evaluated by this rule
ALWAYS_DENY : Always deny deployment of images evaluated by this rule
REQUIRE_ATTESTATION : Require one or more attestors to authorize the
release before deployment
If the evaluationMode is REQUIRE_ATTESTATION , you must provide a reference
to the required attestors in
requireAttestationsBy .
enforcementMode
enforcementMode specifies the action that Binary Authorization takes if a
container image does not conform to the constraints defined in the rule. The
possible values are:
ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG : Blocks deployment and writes to the audit
log.
DRYRUN_AUDIT_LOG_ONLY : Allows deployment of non-conformant images and
writes details about the violation to the audit log.
Most production rules use the ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG enforcement mode.
DRYRUN_AUDIT_LOG_ONLY is primarily used for testing a policy in your
environment before it goes into effect.
requireAttestationsBy
requireAttestationsBy specifies one or more attestors who must authorize the
release before a container image can be deployed. This is required for
REQUIRE_ATTESTATION rules only. The format for this node is:
requireAttestationsBy:
- projects/ PROJECT_ID /attestors/ ATTESTOR_NAME
- ...
where PROJECT_ID is the name of the project where your attestors
are defined and ATTESTOR_NAME is the name of an attestor who
is required to sign the release.
The following example shows how to specify attestors:
requireAttestationsBy:
- projects/example-project/attestors/secure-build
- projects/example-project/attestors/prod-qualified
