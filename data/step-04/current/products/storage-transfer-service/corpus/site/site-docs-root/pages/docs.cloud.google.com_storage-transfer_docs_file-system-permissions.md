Agent-based transfer permissions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Before creating an agent-based transfer, you must configure permissions for the
following entities:
The user or user-managed service account being used to create the
transfer. This is the
account that is signed in to the Google Cloud console, or the account that is
specified when authenticating to the gcloud CLI. The user account can
be a regular user account, or a user-managed service account.
The Google-managed service account , also known as the service
agent, used by Storage Transfer Service. This account is generally identified by
its email address, which uses the format
project- PROJECT_NUMBER @storage-transfer-service.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
The transfer agent account that provides Google Cloud
permissions for transfer agents. Transfer agent accounts use the
credentials of the user installing them, or the credentials of a
user-managed service account, to authenticate.
For more information on granting IAM roles, see
Granting, changing, and
revoking access to resources .
Simplest method of granting permissions
The gcloud CLI can be used to grant the required permissions to the
user / user-managed service account and to the Google-managed service account.
These permissions allow the user to create, edit, and delete transfer jobs,
and set or modify bandwidth limits.
If these permissions
are too broad for your organization's policies, refer to the later sections in
this document for the minimum permissions required by Storage Transfer Service.
To inspect existing permissions and print out any missing roles, run the
following command:
gcloud transfer authorize
To automatically apply those roles, use the --add-missing flag:
gcloud transfer authorize --add-missing
To grant permissions to a user-managed service account, pass the service account
key file:
gcloud transfer authorize --add-missing --creds-file = path/to/key.json
For instructions on creating a service account, see
Creating and managing service accounts .
The command grants the following permissions.
To the user / user-managed service account:
roles/owner
roles/storagetransfer.admin
roles/storagetransfer.transferAgent
roles/storage.objectAdmin
roles/pubsub.editor
To the Google-managed service account:
roles/storage.admin
roles/storagetransfer.serviceAgent
For instructions on installing the gcloud CLI, see the
gcloud quickstart .
User or user-managed service account permissions
This section covers the roles required for the accounts managing and
executing transfers. Your organization's requirements will dictate the exact
roles for each persona; this section assumes that you will create an
administrator and a user.
Administrator accounts
Storage Transfer Service administrator accounts manage transfer
agents, set bandwidth usage limits, and delete transfer jobs.
To set up an administrator account, assign the
following IAM permissions and roles:
Role / Permission
What it does
Notes
resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy
This permission is used to confirm that the Google-managed service
account has the required permissions for a transfer.
To grant this permission, grant the
Role Viewer
( roles/iam.roleViewer ) predefined role, or
create a custom role with
this single permission and grant the custom role.
Storage Transfer Admin
( roles/storagetransfer.admin )
Enables administrative actions in the transfer project, such as
project set up and agent monitoring.
For a detailed listing of permissions granted, see
Storage Transfer Service Predefined roles .
User accounts
Storage Transfer Service user accounts are used to create and execute transfers.
These accounts typically don't have access to delete transfer jobs.
A user account can be a Google Cloud console user, or a service account. If you're
using a service account, the method you use to pass the credentials to
Storage Transfer Service varies depending on the interface you use.
To set up a user account, assign the following permissions and roles to the
account:
Role / Permission
What it does
Notes
resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy
Used to confirm that the Google-managed service account has the
required Pub/Sub permissions for a transfer.
To grant this permission, grant the
Role Viewer
( roles/iam.roleViewer ) predefined role, or
create a custom role with
this single permission and grant the custom role.
Storage Transfer User
( roles/storagetransfer.user )
Enables the user to create, get, update, and list transfers.
For a detailed listing of permissions granted, see
Storage Transfer Service Predefined roles .
Google-managed service account permissions
Storage Transfer Service uses a
Google-managed service
account to move your data. This service account is automatically created
the first time you create a transfer job, call
googleServiceAccounts.get , or visit the job creation page in the
Google Cloud console.
The service account's format is typically
project- PROJECT_NUMBER @storage-transfer-service.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
To retrieve your service account identifier, use the
googleServiceAccounts.get API call.
Automatically assigning roles
There are two ways to automatically assign the correct roles to the
Google-managed service account:
Create your transfer using the Google Cloud console. The console automatically
applies the required permissions.
Use gcloud transfer authorize --add-missing . See
Simplest method of granting permissions .
Manually assigning roles
To allow the Google-managed service account access to resources needed
to complete transfers, assign the following roles, or equivalent
permissions, to the service account.
Role / Permission
What it does
Notes
Storage Object Creator
( roles/storage.objectCreator )
Enables Storage Transfer Service to create
transfer logs in the
Cloud Storage bucket connected to this transfer.
Grant to all Cloud Storage buckets used in a transfer. If
appropriate for your situation, you can grant the role on a
project level to the project that Storage Transfer Service is running from.
For a detailed listing of the permissions these roles grant, see
Cloud Storage Predefined roles .
Storage Object Viewer
( roles/storage.objectViewer )
Enables Storage Transfer Service to determine if a file has already been
transferred to or from Cloud Storage.
Storage Transfer Service Agent
( roles/storagetransfer.serviceAgent )
Enables Storage Transfer Service to automatically create and modify
Pub/Sub topics to communicate from
Google Cloud to transfer agents.
Apply the role on a project level to the project that
Storage Transfer Service is running from.
For a detailed listing of the permissions this role
grants, see
Permissions
and roles .
Storage Legacy Bucket Reader
( roles/storage.legacyBucketReader )
Enables Storage Transfer Service to read Cloud Storage bucket metadata.
Grant to each Cloud Storage bucket used in a transfer.
Cloud Storage legacy roles can only be granted
at the bucket level.
See Grant the required permissions for instructions.
Transfer agent account permissions
Storage Transfer Service transfer agents can be run with either the user's
account, or with a
service account .
To set up a transfer agent service account or user account
running the transfer agents, assign the following role:
Role / Permission
What it does
Notes
Storage Transfer Agent
( roles/storagetransfer.transferAgent )
Gives transfer agents the Storage Transfer Service permissions required to
complete a transfer. This role also includes permissions required to
log skipped files.
Grant this role to the user or service account being used by agents.
For a detailed listing of the permissions this role grants, see
Access Control with IAM .
Source and destination permissions
You must also ensure that the agent account has the correct permissions to
access the source data and to write to the destination.
File system, S3-compatible storage, or HDFS to Cloud Storage
If your transfer destination is a Cloud Storage bucket, the
transfer agent needs the following permissions on the destination bucket. See
Add a principal to a bucket-level policy
for instructions.

in the sink; for example, if
overwriteObjectsAlreadyExistingInSink
or deleteObjectsUniqueInSink are set in your transfer's
transferOptions configuration.
To grant these permissions, grant the following role:
Storage Object Admin ( roles/storage.objectAdmin )
Or, create a custom role with the specific
permissions and grant the custom role.
Additional permissions are required to
enable multipart uploads .
Cloud Storage to file system
If your transfer's source is a Cloud Storage bucket, the
transfer agent needs the following permission on the source bucket.
