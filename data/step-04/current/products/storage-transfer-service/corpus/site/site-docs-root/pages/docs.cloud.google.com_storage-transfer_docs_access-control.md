Permissions and roles
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Storage Transfer Service uses
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
permissions and roles to control who can access Storage Transfer Service
resources. The main types of resources available in Storage Transfer Service
are jobs, operations, and agent pools. In the
IAM policy hierarchy , jobs are child
resources of projects, and operations are child resources of jobs.
To grant access to a resource, you assign one or more
permissions or
roles to a user, group, or a
service account .
Permissions
You can grant the following Storage Transfer Service permissions:
Transfer project permission
Permission

Cloud Storage buckets.
Transfer job permissions
The following table describes permissions for Storage Transfer Service jobs:
Permission
Description
storagetransfer.jobs.create

storagetransfer.operations.get
Can get details of transfer operations.
storagetransfer.operations.list
Can list all transfer job operations.
storagetransfer.operations.pause

Role details
The following table describes in detail the predefined roles for
Storage Transfer Service:
Role
Description
Included Permissions
Storage Transfer Admin
( roles/storagetransfer.admin )
Provides all Storage Transfer Service permissions, including deleting
jobs.
Rationale: This is the highest-level role with the
broadest responsibilities, the superuser who supports their colleagues
as they perform transfers. This is most suitable for people that will
administer transfers, such as IT admins.
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
storagetransfer.*
Storage Transfer User
( roles/storagetransfer.user )
Provides permissions for the user to create, get, update, and list
transfer jobs within the project. However, they can't delete their own
jobs.
Rationale: This role allows the separation of creating
and maintaining jobs from deleting jobs. This role is best suited for
users who are required to execute transfers as part of their job
function, such as an employee. This role doesn't allow transfer to be
deleted, so that auditors or security personnel can view a fully
preserved record of past transfers.
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
storagetransfer.agentpools.create
storagetransfer.agentpools.get
storagetransfer.agentpools.list
storagetransfer.agentpools.report
storagetransfer.agentpools.update
storagetransfer.jobs.create
storagetransfer.jobs.get
storagetransfer.jobs.list
storagetransfer.jobs.run
storagetransfer.jobs.update
storagetransfer.operations.*
storagetransfer.projects.getServiceAccount
Storage Transfer Viewer
( roles/storagetransfer.viewer )
Provides permissions to list and get jobs and transfer operations within
the project. The user can't schedule, update, or delete jobs.
Rationale: The viewer role is intended for read-only
access to view transfer jobs and operations. This role allows separating
the report and auditing tasks from creating and maintaining jobs. This
role is most suitable for users or internal teams that audit transfer
usage, such as security, compliance, or business unit leaders.
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
storagetransfer.agentpools.get
storagetransfer.agentpools.list
storagetransfer.jobs.get
storagetransfer.jobs.list
storagetransfer.operations.get
storagetransfer.operations.list
storagetransfer.projects.getServiceAccount
Storage Transfer Agent
( roles/storagetransfer.transferAgent )
Gives transfer agents the Storage Transfer Service permissions required to
complete a transfer.
As of May 1, 2024, pubsub permissions are no longer
required.
Grant this role to the user or service account being used by agents.
logging.logEntries.create
monitoring.timeSeries.create
pubsub.subscriptions.consume
pubsub.subscriptions.create
pubsub.subscriptions.delete
pubsub.subscriptions.get
pubsub.topics.attachSubscription

storagetransfer.agentpools.report
storagetransfer.operations.assign
storagetransfer.operations.get
storagetransfer.operations.report
Storage Transfer Service Agent
( roles/storagetransfer.serviceAgent )
Gives the
Storage Transfer Service service agent the permissions required to create
and modify Pub/Sub topics to communicate from
Google Cloud to transfer agents.
Grant this role to the
Storage Transfer Service service agent .
pubsub.subscriptions.consume
pubsub.subscriptions.create
pubsub.subscriptions.delete
pubsub.subscriptions.get
pubsub.subscriptions.update
pubsub.topics.attachSubscription
pubsub.topics.create
pubsub.topics.delete
pubsub.topics.get
pubsub.topics.publish
pubsub.topics.update
Custom roles
You can create and apply
custom IAM roles to meet your
organization's access requirements.
When creating custom roles, we recommend using a combination of
predefined roles to ensure that the correct permissions
are included together.
The Google Cloud console will not work properly if the custom role is missing
required permissions. For example, some parts of the Google Cloud console
assume a role has read access to display an item before editing it, so a role
with only write permissions may encounter Google Cloud console screens that
don't work.
