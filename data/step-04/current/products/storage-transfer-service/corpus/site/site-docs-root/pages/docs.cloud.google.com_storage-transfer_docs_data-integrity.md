Data integrity

Storage Transfer Service uses metadata available from the source storage system,
such as checksums and file sizes, to ensure that data written to
Cloud Storage is the same data read from the source.
When checksum metadata is available
If checksum metadata is available on the source, Storage Transfer Service uses
end-to-end checksum validation. If the checksum metadata on the source storage
system indicates that the data Storage Transfer Service received doesn't match the
source data, Storage Transfer Service records a failure for the transfer operation.
Examples of storage systems that include checksum metadata include most Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage objects ( with some exceptions )
and HTTP transfers (checksum metadata are provided by the user).
When checksum metadata is unavailable
When agents can run near the source
If checksum metadata isn't available from the underlying source storage system
but agents can be run locally
near the source storage system, Storage Transfer Service attempts to read the
source data and compute a checksum before sending the data to
Cloud Storage. This occurs when moving data from file systems to
Cloud Storage.
When agents can't run near the source
If checksum metadata isn't available from the underlying source storage system,
and agents can't be run locally near the source storage system,
Storage Transfer Service uses available metadata, such as file size, to validate that
the file copied to Cloud Storage matches the source file.
Storage Transfer Service also computes a checksum of the data "on-the-fly" as it's
being transferred. Once the data is stored in Cloud Storage,
Storage Transfer Service compares the checksum it computed against the final checksum
reported by Cloud Storage. If the checksums don't match, the task
fails with a DATA_LOSS error.
On-the-fly checksumming is used for transfers from sources that may not provide
checksums, such as:
Amazon S3 multi-part objects
Amazon S3 objects stored with server-side encryption with keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)
Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Put Block List
After transfer checks
After your transfer is complete, we recommend performing additional data
integrity checks to validate that:
The correct version of the files are copied, for files that change at
the source.
The correct set and number of files are copied, to verify that you've
set up the transfer jobs correctly.
The files were copied correctly, by verifying the metadata on the files,
such as file checksums, file size, and so forth.
