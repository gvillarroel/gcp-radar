Transfer from S3-compatible storage to Cloud Storage
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Storage Transfer Service supports transfers from cloud or on-premises object storage
systems that are compatible with the Amazon S3 API.
Storage Transfer Service accesses your data in S3-compatible storage using transfer
agents deployed on VMs close to the data source. These agents run in a Docker
container and belong to an agent pool, which is a collection of agents using
the same configuration and that collectively move your data in parallel.
This feature allows you to
migrate from on-premise or cloud object storage to Cloud Storage, archive
data to free up on-premises storage capacity, replicate data to
Google Cloud for business continuity, or transfer data to
Google Cloud for analysis and processing. For customers migrating
from AWS S3 to Cloud Storage, this feature gives an option to control
network routes to Google Cloud, resulting in considerably lower
outbound data transfer charges.
Before you begin
Before configuring your transfers, complete the following steps:
Install the gcloud CLI .
Satisfy the
requirements for file system transfers ,
including installing Docker on the transfer agent machine.
Obtain source credentials
Transferring from S3-compatible storage requires an access key ID and
a secret access key .
The steps to obtain these depend on your storage provider.
The account from which the ID and key are generated requires one of the
following permissions:
Read-only permission on source objects, if you don't want to delete objects
at source.
Full access to source objects, if you choose to delete objects at source as
part of your transfer.
Once you've created the account, added permissions, and downloaded the
access key ID and secret access key , store the ID and key in a safe
place.
Configure Google Cloud permissions
Before creating a transfer, you must configure permissions for the following
entities:
The user account being used to create the transfer. This is the
account that is signed in to the Google Cloud console, or the account that is
specified when authenticating to the `gcloud` CLI. The user account can
be a regular user account, or a user-managed service account.
The Google-managed service account , also known as the service
agent, used by Storage Transfer Service. This account is generally identified by
its email address, which uses the format
project- PROJECT_NUMBER @storage-transfer-service.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
The transfer agent account that provides Google Cloud
permissions for transfer agents. Transfer agent accounts use the
credentials of the user installing them, or the credentials of a
user-managed service account, to authenticate.
See
Agent-based transfer permissions
for instructions.
Transfer options
The following Storage Transfer Service features are available for transfers from
S3-compatible storage to Cloud Storage:
Transfer specific files using a manifest
You can pass a list of files for Storage Transfer Service to act on. See
Transfer specific files or
objects using a manifest for details.
Specify storage class
You can specify the
Cloud Storage storage class to use for your data in the destination
bucket. See the
StorageClass options for REST details, or use the
--custom-storage-class flag with Google Cloud CLI.
Note that any storage class settings are ignored if the destination
bucket has Autoclass enabled. If
Autoclass is enabled, objects transferred into the bucket are initially
set to Standard storage.
Metadata preservation
When transferring files from S3-compatible storage, Storage Transfer Service can
optionally preserve certain attributes as custom metadata.
See the Amazon S3 or S3-compatible storage to Cloud
Storage section of
Metadata preservation for details on which metadata can be
preserved, and how to configure your transfer.
Logging and monitoring
Transfers from S3-compatible storage can be viewed in Cloud Logging and
Cloud Monitoring. See
Cloud Logging for
Storage Transfer Service and
Monitor transfer
jobs for details. You can also configure
Pub/Sub
notifications .
Create an agent pool
Don't include sensitive information such as personally identifiable information
(PII) or security data in your agent pool name or agent ID prefix. Resource names may be
propagated to the names of other Google Cloud resources and may be exposed
to Google-internal systems outside of your project.
To create an agent pool:
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Agent pools page.
Go to Agent pools
The Agent pools page is displayed, listing your existing agent pools.
Click Create another pool .
Name your pool, and optionally describe it.
You may choose to set a bandwidth limit that will apply to the pool as a
whole. The specified bandwidth in MB/s will be split amongst all of the
agents in the pool. See
Manage network bandwidth
for more information.
Click Create .
REST API
Use
projects.agentPools.create :
POST https://storagetransfer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /agentPools?agent_pool_id= AGENT_POOL_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The project ID that you're creating
the agent pool in.
AGENT_POOL_ID : The agent pool ID that you are
creating.
If an agent pool is stuck in the Creating state for more than 30 minutes,
we recommend deleting the agent pool and creating it again.
Revoking required Storage Transfer Service permissions from a project while
an agent pool is in the Creating state leads to incorrect service behavior.
gcloud CLI
To create an agent pool with the gcloud command line tool, run
[ gcloud transfer agent-pools create ][agent-pools-create].
gcloud transfer agent-pools create AGENT_POOL
Where the following options are available:
AGENT_POOL is a unique, permanent identifier for this pool.
--no-async blocks other tasks in your terminal until the pool has been
created. If not included, pool creation runs asynchronously.
--bandwidth-limit defines how much of your bandwidth in MB/s to make
available to this pool's agents. A bandwidth limit applies to all agents in
a pool and can help prevent the pool's transfer workload from disrupting
other operations that share your bandwidth. For example, enter '50' to set a
bandwidth limit of 50 MB/s. By leaving this flag unspecified, this pool's
agents will use all bandwidth available to them.
--display-name is a modifiable name to help you identify this pool. You
can include details that might not fit in the pool's unique full resource
name.
Install transfer agents
Transfer agents are software agents that coordinate transfer activities from
your source through Storage Transfer Service. They must be installed on a system with
access to your source data.
gcloud CLI
To install agents to use with an S3-compatible source using the gcloud CLI,
use the transfer agents install command.
You must provide access credentials either as environment variables as the
values of AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY , or stored as
default credentials in your system's configuration files.
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = ID
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = SECRET
gcloud transfer agents install --pool = POOL_NAME
To run agents using a
service account key , use
the --creds-file option:
gcloud transfer agents install --pool = POOL_NAME \
--creds-file = /relative/path/to/service-account-key.json
Create a transfer job
Google Cloud console
Follow these steps to create a transfer from an S3-compatible source to a
Cloud Storage bucket.
Go to the Storage Transfer Service page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Storage Transfer Service
Click Create transfer job . The Create a transfer job page is
displayed.
Select S3-compatible object storage as the Source type . The
destination must be Google Cloud Storage .
Click Next step .
Configure your source
Specify the required information for this transfer:
Select the agent pool you configured for this
transfer.
Enter the Bucket name relative to the endpoint. For example, if
your data resides at:
https://example.com/bucket_a
Enter: bucket_a
Enter the Endpoint . Do not include the protocol ( http:// or
https:// ) or the bucket name. For example:
example.com
Specify any optional attributes for this transfer:
Enter the Signing region to use for signing of requests.
Choose the Signing process for this request.
Select the Addressing style . This determines whether the bucket
name is provided in path-style (e.g.,
https://example.com/bucket-name/key-name ) or
virtual hosted-style (e.g.,
https://bucket-name.example.com/key-name ). Read
Virtual hosting of buckets in the Amazon documentation for more
information.
Select the Network protocol .
Select the listing API version to use. Refer to the
ListObjectsV2 and ListObjects documentation for more information.
Click Next step .
Configure your sink
In the Bucket or folder field, enter the destination bucket
and (optionally) folder name, or click
Browse to select a bucket from a list of existing buckets in your
current project. To create a new bucket, click
Create new bucket .
Click Next step .
Choose transfer settings
In the Description field, enter a description of the
transfer. As a best practice, enter a description that is meaningful and
unique so that you can tell jobs apart.
Under Metadata options , choose to use the default options,
or click View and select options to specify values for all
supported metadata. See
Metadata preservation
for details.
Under When to overwrite , select one of the following:
If different : Overwrites destination files if the source file
with the same name has different Etags or checksum values.
Always : Always overwrites destination files when the source file
has the same name, even if they're identical.
Under When to delete , select one of the following:
Never : Never delete files from either the source or destination.
Delete file from source after they're transferred : Delete files
from the source after they're transferred to the destination.
If a source file isn't transferred, for example because it
already exists in the destination, the source file is not
deleted.
Important: If you don't have local backup, this option is a
non-reversible action.
Delete files from destination if they're not also at source : If
files in the destination Cloud Storage bucket aren't also in
the source, then delete the files from the Cloud Storage
bucket.
This option ensures that the destination Cloud Storage bucket
exactly matches your source.
Under Notification options , select your Pub/Sub topic and which
events to notify for. See
Pub/Sub notifications for
more details.
Click Next step .
Schedule the transfer
You can schedule your transfer to run one time only, or configure a recurring
transfer.
Click Create to create the transfer job.
gcloud CLI
Before using the gcloud CLI to create a transfer, follow the instructions in
Configure access to a Cloud Storage sink .
To use the gcloud CLI to create a transfer from an S3-compatible source to
a Cloud Storage bucket, use the following command.
gcloud transfer jobs create s3: // SOURCE_BUCKET_NAME gs:// SINK_BUCKET_NAME \
--source-agent-pool= POOL_NAME \
--source-endpoint= ENDPOINT \
--source-signing-region= REGION \
--source-auth-method= AWS_SIGNATURE_V2 | AWS_SIGNATURE_V4 \
--source-request-model= PATH_STYLE | VIRTUAL_HOSTED_STYLE \
--source-network-protocol= HTTP | HTTPS \
--source-list-api= LIST_OBJECTS | LIST_OBJECTS_V2
The following flags are required:
--source-agent-pool is the name of the agent pool to use for this
transfer.
--source-endpoint specifies your storage system's endpoint. For example,
s3.us-east.example.com . Check with your provider for the correct
formatting. Don't include the protocol (e.g., https:// ) or the bucket
name.
The remaining flags are optional:
--source-signing-region specifies a region for signing requests.
Omit this flag if your storage provider doesn't require a signing region.
--source-auth-method specifies the authentication method to use. Valid
values are AWS_SIGNATURE_V2 or AWS_SIGNATURE_V4 . Refer to
Amazon's SigV4 and SigV2 documentation for more information.
--source-request-model specifies the addressing style to use. Valid values
are PATH_STYLE or VIRTUAL_HOSTED_STYLE .
Path style uses the format
https://s3. REGION .example.com/ BUCKET_NAME / KEY_NAME .
Virtual hosted style uses the format
`https:// BUCKET_NAME .s3. REGION .example.com/ KEY_NAME .
--source-network-protocol specifies the network protocol that agents
should use for this job. Valid values are HTTP or HTTPS .
--source-list-api specifies the version of the S3 listing API for
returning objects from the bucket. Valid values are LIST_OBJECTS or
LIST_OBJECTS_V2 . Refer to Amazon's ListObjectsV2 and
ListObjects documentation for more information.
For additional transfer job options, run gcloud transfer jobs create --help
or refer to the gcloud reference documentation .
REST API
Before using the REST API to create a transfer, follow the instructions in
Configure access to a Cloud Storage sink .
To create a transfer from an S3-compatible source using the REST API, create
a JSON object similar to the following example.
POST https: //storagetransfer.googleapis.com/v1/transferJobs
{
...
"transferSpec" : {
"source_agent_pool_name" : " POOL_NAME " ,
"awsS3CompatibleData" : {
"region" : "us-east-1" ,
"s3Metadata" : {

If your S3-compatible provider uses an SSL certificate that is not issued by a
public certificate authority, your transfers may fail with a TLS error. To
resolve this, mount the provider's root certificate to the transfer
agent container at /etc/ssl/certs/ CERT_FILE using the -v
Docker flag.
For example:
sudo docker run --ulimit memlock=64000000 -d --rm \
-v HOST_DIRECTORY : CONTAINER_DIRECTORY \
-v PATH/TO/KEY.JSON :/etc/gcloud/key.json:ro \
-v /path/to/your/ CERT_FILE :/etc/ssl/certs/ CERT_FILE \
-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
-e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
gcr.io/cloud-ingest/tsop-agent:latest \
--project-id= PROJECT_ID \
--creds-file=/etc/gcloud/key.json \
--hostname=$(hostname) \
--agent-pool= POOL_NAME
Is there a cost to transfer from S3-compatible storage?
Transfers from S3-compatible storage do not incur the "Storage Transfer Service
transfers requiring agents" fee. See Pricing for
any other fees that may be incurred. You may also incur outbound data transfer
and operational charges from your source cloud provider.
Is Cloud Logging supported for S3-compatible storage transfers?
Yes, you can enable Cloud Logging for your transfers by following the
instructions in
Cloud Logging for Storage Transfer Service .
Are transfers using a manifest supported?
Yes, manifest files are supported for
S3-compatible transfers.
If I add an object to the source bucket after the job has started, is that
object transferred?
Storage Transfer Service performs a list operation on the source bucket to compute the
diff from the destination. If the list operation has already completed when the
new object is added, that object is skipped until the next transfer.
Does Storage Transfer Service perform checksum matching on S3-compatible sources?
Storage Transfer Service relies on checksum data being returned by the source. For
S3-compatible storage, Storage Transfer Service expects the object's Etag to be the
MD5 hash of the object.
However, any objects that were transferred to S3-compatible storage using
S3 multipart upload do not have MD5 ETags. In this case, Storage Transfer Service
uses the file size to validate the transferred object.
What throughput can be achieved for transfers from S3-compatible storage?
Your transfer throughput can be scaled by adding more transfer agents. We
recommend using 3 agents for fault tolerance and to fill a <10Gbps pipe. To
scale more, add more agents. Agents can be added and removed while a transfer
is in process.
Where should transfer agents be deployed to transfer data from Amazon S3 to
Cloud Storage?
You can install agents in Amazon EC2 or EKS within the same region as your
bucket. You can also run agents on Google Cloud in the nearest region.
