Transfer from public URLs to Cloud Storage
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Storage Transfer Service can copy files from a list of public URLs to your
Cloud Storage bucket.
When creating a transfer, you provide a link to a tab-separated values (TSV)
file containing the URLs and details of the objects to transfer. The TSV file
can be hosted in any publicly-accessible HTTP or HTTPS location; or can be
stored in a Cloud Storage bucket.
This page explains how to create a URL list and pass it to the job creation
command.
Source file requirements
URLs must be publicly-accessible and use HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
The server hosting each object:
Must not deny access to the object with a robots.txt .
Supports Range requests.
Returns a Content-Length header in each response.
URL list format
A URL list must adhere to the following requirements:
The file must be formatted as tab-separated values.
URLs must be in UTF-8 lexicographical order.
The first line must specify TsvHttpData-1.0 .
After the first line, specify one object per row.
Each row must contain the URL, and may also contain the file size and
the base64-encoded MD5 checksum of the object.
The following is a sample TSV file that specifies two objects to transfer. Note
that on this page the tabs are rendered as spaces; for your own file, make sure
to use tabs between fields.
TsvHttpData-1.0
https://example.com/myfile.pdf 1357 wHENa08V36iPYAsOa2JAdw==
https://example2.com/images/dataset1/flower.png 2468 R9acAaveoPd2y8nniLUYbw==
Each line contains:
The HTTP or HTTPS URL of a source object.
(Optional) The size of the object in bytes.
Ensure that the specified size matches the actual size of the object
when it is fetched. If the size of the object received by
Cloud Storage does not match the size specified, the object
transfer will fail.
(Optional) The base64-encoded MD5 checksum of the object.
Ensure that the specified MD5 checksum matches the MD5 checksum computed
from the transferred bytes. If the MD5 checksum of the object received
by Cloud Storage does not match the MD5 checksum specified, the
object transfer will fail.
Note: Many checksumming tools output an object's MD5 checksum in
base16-encoded format. Ensure the values provided are in base64-encoded
format.
While the object size and MD5 checksum values are optional, we strongly
recommend including them to help ensure data integrity.
Hosting the URL list
The URL list can be hosted in one of two locations:
A publicly-accessible URL.
A Cloud Storage bucket, to which the service agent for Storage Transfer Service
has been granted access.
Publicly-accessible URLs
When storing the URL list at a publicly-accessible URL, the following
requirements apply:
The URL must begin with http:// or https:// .
The server must set a strong Etag header in the HTTP response when it
returns the URL list.
For example, you can store the list in a Cloud Storage bucket and
share the object publicly to
get a link to it.
Cloud Storage buckets
To avoid storing your list in a public location, you can store it in a
Cloud Storage bucket, and grant access to the service agent
for Storage Transfer Service.
The service agent must be granted the following permissions:
The storage.object.get permission on the object. This can be granted by
granting the roles/storage.legacyObjectReader role on the bucket, or with a
custom role.
The storage.buckets.get permission on the bucket. This can be granted by
granting the roles/storage.legacyBucketReader role, or with a custom role.
To grant permissions to the service agent:
Find the service agent's email
Go to the
googleServiceAccounts.get reference
page .
An interactive panel opens, titled Try this method .
In the panel, under Request parameters , enter your
project ID. The project you specify here must be the project you're
using to manage Storage Transfer Service, which might be different from the URL
list bucket's project.
Click Execute .
Your service agent's email is returned as the value of accountEmail and
uses the format
project- PROJECT_NUMBER @storage-transfer-service.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Copy this value.
Grant the required roles
To grant the roles/storage.objectViewer role and the
roles/storage.bucketViewer role to the service agent on the bucket containing
the URL list, follow the instructions in
Set and manage IAM policies on buckets .
The principal you are adding is the service agent's email address. If required,
the principal identifier is serviceAccount . For example,
serviceAccount:project- PROJECT_NUMBER @storage-transfer-service.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Create a URL list transfer job
To specify a URL list when creating a transfer job, follow these instructions:
Google Cloud console
Follow the instructions in
Create a transfer job .
When choosing a source:
Under Source type , select URL list and click Next step .
Under URL of TSV file , provide the URL to your tab-separated values
(TSV) file. The URL is either an HTTP/HTTPS address (e.g.
https://example.com/urllist.tsv ) or a Cloud Storage path
(e.g. gs://my-bucket/urllist.tsv ).
gcloud CLI
To create a new transfer job, use the gcloud transfer jobs create
command.
gcloud transfer jobs create \
SOURCE DESTINATION
For URL list transfers, the value of SOURCE is the URL of the
TSV file. The URL is either an HTTP/HTTPS address (e.g.
https://example.com/urllist.tsv ) or a Cloud Storage path
(e.g. gs://my-bucket/urllist.tsv ).
For more information on creating transfers using gcloud CLI, see
Create transfer jobs .
REST
To create a URL list transfer job using the REST API, specify the URL of the
TSV file in the listUrl field:
{
"projectId" : " PROJECT_ID " ,
"transferSpec" : {
"httpDataSource" : {
"listUrl" : " URL "
},
"gcsDataSink" : {
"bucketName" : "DESTINATION_BUCKET"
}
},
"status" : "ENABLED"
}
The value of URL is either an HTTP/HTTPS address (e.g.
https://example.com/urllist.tsv ) or a Cloud Storage path
(e.g. gs://my-bucket/urllist.tsv ).
For more details on creating transfers using the REST API, see the
REST API reference .
