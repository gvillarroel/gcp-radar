External DAGs migration from v4.2 to v5.0
Warning: This page contains specific information to update only Google Cloud Cortex Framework
versions 4.2 to 5.0. The content might not apply to other versions.
This guide outlines the steps necessary to relocate output tables from external
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to their new locations within the Cortex Data
Foundation v5.0 architecture. For example, Weather and Trends. This guide is
specifically designed for users who have implemented External DAGs in previous
Cortex Framework Data Foundation versions (4.2 to 5.0) and are now upgrading. If
you haven't used External DAGs or haven't deployed SAP, this guide is not
applicable.
Context
Cortex Framework Data Foundation versions prior to 4.2 used a _GEN_EXT flag to manage
the deployment of external data sources, with some sources tied to specific
workloads (like currency conversion for SAP). However, with version 5.0, this
flag has been removed. Now, there's a new module dedicated to managing DAGs
that can serve multiple workloads. This guide outlines steps to adjust your
existing data pipelines to work with this new structure.
Cross-workload reusable DAGs
Cortex Framework Data Foundation v5.0 introduces K9, a new component responsible for
ingesting, processing, and modeling reusable data elements that are shared
across various data sources. Reporting views are now reference the
K9_PROCESSING dataset to access these reusable components, streamlining data
access and reducing redundancy. The following external data sources are now
deployed as a part of K9, into the K9_PROCESSING dataset:
date_dimension
holiday_calendar
trends
weather
SAP-dependent DAGs
The following SAP-dependent DAGs are still triggered by
generate_external_dags.sh script, but now executes during the reporting build
step, and now write into the SAP reporting dataset instead of the CDC
(Change Data Capture) stage.
currency_conversion
inventory_snapshots
prod_hierarchy_texts
Migration Guide
This guide outlines the steps to upgrade your Cortex Framework Data Foundation to version 5.0.
Deploy Cortex Framework Data Foundation 5.0
First, deploy the newest version (v5.0) of Cortex Framework Data Foundation to your
projects, with the following guidelines:
Use your existing RAW and CDC datasets from prior development or staging
deployments as your RAW and CDC datasets of this deployment, as no modification
is made to them during deployment.
Set both testData and SAP.deployCDC to False in config/config.json .
Create a new SAP Reporting project separate from your existing v4.2
environment for testing purposes. This safely evaluate the upgrade process
without impacting your current operations.
Optional. If you have active Airflow DAGs running for your previous
Cortex Framework Data Foundation version, pause them before proceeding with the migration.
This can be done through the Airflow UI. For detailed instructions see
Open Airflow UI from Composer
and Pause the DAG
documentation.
By following these steps, you can safely transition to Cortex Framework Data Foundation
version 5.0 and validate the new features and functionalities.
Migrate existing tables
To migrate your existing tables to their new location, use jinja-cli to
format the provided migration script template to complete the migration.
Install jinja-cli with the following command:
pip install jinja-cli
Identify the following parameters from your existing version 4.2 and new
version 5.0 deployment:
Name
Description
project_id_src
Source Google Cloud Project: Project where your existing SAP CDC dataset
from version 4.2 deployment is located. K9_PROCESSING dataset
is also created in this project.
project_id_tgt
Target Google Cloud where your newly deployed SAP Reporting dataset from
the new version 5.0 deployment is located. This might be
different from the source project.
dataset_cdc_processed
CDC BigQuery Dataset:
BigQuery dataset where the CDC processed data lands the
latest available records. This might be the same as the source dataset.
dataset_reporting_tgt
Target BigQuery reporting dataset: BigQuery
dataset where the Data Foundation for SAP predefined data models are deployed.
k9_datasets_processing
K9 BigQuery dataset:
BigQuery dataset where the K9 (augmented data sources) is deployed.
Create a JSON file with the required input data. Make sure to remove any
DAGs you don't want to migrate from the migrate_list section:
{
"project_id_src" : "your-source-project" ,
"project_id_tgt" : "your-target-project" ,
"dataset_cdc_processed" : "your-cdc-processed-dataset" ,
"dataset_reporting_tgt" : "your-reporting-target-dataset-OR-SAP_REPORTING" ,
"k9_datasets_processing" : "your-k9-processing-dataset-OR-K9_REPORTING" ,
"migrate_list" :
[
"holiday_calendar" ,
"trends" ,
"weather" ,
"currency_conversion" ,
"inventory_snapshots" ,
"prod_hierarchy_texts"
]
}
EOF
For example, if you want to remove weather and trends , the script would
look like the following:
{
"project_id_src" : "kittycorn-demo" ,
"project_id_tgt" : "kittycorn-demo" ,
"dataset_cdc_processed" : "CDC_PROCESSED" ,
"dataset_reporting_tgt" : "SAP_REPORTING" ,
"k9_datasets_processing" : "K9_PROCESSING" ,
"migrate_list" :
[
"holiday_calendar" ,
"currency_conversion" ,
"inventory_snapshots" ,
"prod_hierarchy_texts"
]
}
Create an output folder with the following command:
mkdir output
Generate the parsed migration script with the following command (this command
assumes you are at the root of the repository):
jinja -d data.json -o output/migrate_external_dags.sql docs/external_dag_migration/scripts/migrate_external_dags.sql
Examine the output SQL file and execute in BigQuery to migrate your tables to the new location.
Update and unpause the Airflow DAGs
Back up the current DAG Files in your Airflow bucket. Then, replace them with
the newly generated files from your Cortex Framework Data Foundation version 5.0
deployment. For detail instructions, see the following documentation:
Open Airflow UI from Composer
Unpause the DAG
Validation and cleanup
The migration is now complete. You can now validate that all reporting views
in the new v5.0 reporting deployment is working correctly. If everything works
properly, go through the process again, this time targeting the v5.0 deployment
to your production Reporting set. Afterwards, feel free to remove all tables
using the following script:
Warning: This step permanently removes your old DAG tables and can't be undone
after is applied. Only execute this step after all validation is complete.
Consider taking backups of these tables.
jinja -d data.json -o output/delete_old_dag_tables.sql docs/external_dag_migration/scripts/delete_old_dag_tables.sql
