Looker Block for Cross Media & Product Connected Insights
This page describes the insights you can get from the Cortex Looker Block
for Cross Media & Product Connected Insights. With this Looker Block
you can get a comprehensive view of your campaign spend and performance by
combining your campaign data from multiple paid media platforms
including Google Ads, Meta, TikTok and YouTube (with DV360) into
BigQuery with pre-packaged ingestion pipelines and reporting views
provided by Google Cloud Cortex Framework for Marketing .
This pipeline also includes an option to use a Gemini text generation
model on Vertex AI to match textual representations of media campaigns
with a single product hierarchy node. For example, a campaign named
"BMX - Reels - Reach" matches the product hierarchy node
['Fitness & Sports', 'Bicycles', 'Special Bikes','BMX Bikes'] .
See a
high level breakdown of volume of impressions and clicks from each platform for
campaigns relating to specific product category and product.
