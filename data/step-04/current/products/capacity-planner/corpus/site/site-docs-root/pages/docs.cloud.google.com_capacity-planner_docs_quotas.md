This document lists the quotas and system limits that apply to
Capacity Planner.
Quotas have default values, but you can typically request
adjustments.
System limits are fixed values that can't be changed.
Google Cloud uses quotas to help ensure fairness and reduce
spikes in resource use and availability. A quota restricts how much of a
Google Cloud resource your Google Cloud project can use. Quotas
apply to a range of resource types, including hardware, software, and network
components. For example, quotas can restrict the number of API calls to a
service, the number of load balancers used concurrently by your project, or the
number of projects that you can create. Quotas protect the community of
Google Cloud users by preventing the overloading of services. Quotas also
help you to manage your own Google Cloud resources.
The Cloud Quotas system does the following:
Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services
Restricts your consumption of those resources
Provides a way to
request changes to the quota value
and automate quota adjustments
In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota
allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that
you're trying to perform fails.
Quotas generally apply at the Google Cloud project
level. Your use of a resource in one project doesn't affect
your available quota in another project. Within a Google Cloud project, quotas
are shared across all applications and IP addresses.
For more information, see the
Cloud Quotas overview .
There are also system limits on Capacity Planner resources.
System limits can't be changed.
Allocation quotas
The following quotas don't reset over time and instead are released when you
release the resource:

Request a quota adjustment .
Enable the quota adjuster
in your project. By enabling the quota adjuster, you allow
Google Cloud to automatically submit quota increase requests on your
behalf when your quota nears a limit.
