This product is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This document explains how to view usage and forecast data for your resources in
Capacity Planner. To learn more about Capacity Planner,
see Capacity Planner overview .
You can view the usage and forecast data for the following compute resources:
Compute Engine instances including vCPUs, memory, and Local SSD
disks attached to the instances.
Google Cloud Hyperdisk and Persistent Disk volumes for storage, IOPS, and
throughput, whether they are attached to instances or not.
GPUs, whether they are attached to instances or not.
TPUs.
You can also view your reservations, including current on-demand
reservations as well as past and current future reservation requests, of
compute resources.
You can use data about compute resources to help optimize your resource usage
and plan for future capacity and quota needs in your project, folder, or
organization.
You can view the usage data for Cloud Storage buckets for
egress bandwidth. You can use this data to monitor when to
request more bandwidth. For more information about egress bandwidth and how
to request more bandwidth, see
Overview of bandwidth usage in Cloud Storage .
If your requests for increasing egress bandwidth are rejected, then
contact Technical Account Management .
In addition, you can view the forecasts made on any day during the last
year. This data lets you compare how predictions for your resources have changed
over time, analyze the usage trends of the resources across various percentiles,
and evaluate past prediction accuracy against actual historical usage. For more
information, see the
View historical forecast snapshots
section.
Limitations
Before you view usage and forecast data in Capacity Planner,
consider the following:
Forecast data isn't supported for the following resources:
Spot VMs (including
the instances and any attached resources, such as GPUs and TPUs)
Cloud Storage buckets
Usage data for Spot VMs and preemptible quota is only
available for instances, GPUs, and TPUs. To view this data, use one of
the following methods:
In the Google Cloud console, open one of the following graphs:
Usage and forecast by machine family
Usage and forecast by GPU type
Usage and forecast by TPU type
Click
tune More options ,
and then click the Spot usage toggle to the on position.
In the Capacity Planner API, set the isSpot field to true .
The
Usage and forecast by resource type graph has the
following limitations:
You can only view quota for your compute instances, GPUs, or TPUs when
you do all of the following:
You view usage and forecast data in your project.
You filter the graph by a single machine family, GPU type, or TPU
type.
For instances and GPUs, you filter the graph by region. For TPUs, to
view quota for Google Kubernetes Engine, filter the graph by region; to view
quota for Cloud TPU, filter by zone.
You can only view reservations and future reservation requests when you
do both of the following:
You view usage and forecast data for instances or GPUs.
You view usage and forecast data in the project where you created
the reservations, the folder containing this project, or your
organization.
You can only view the Usage and forecast by machine types table when you
view usage and forecast data for instances or GPUs.
Historical forecast snapshots are available for only Compute Engine
instances, Hyperdisk and Persistent Disk volumes, GPUs, and
TPUs. To view this data for a resource, use one of the following methods:
In the Google Cloud console, follow the steps mentioned in the
View historical forecast snapshots
section.
In the Capacity Planner API, use the startDate , endDate , and
generationDate fields to specify the required date and time in
ISO 8601 format ( YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ ). These fields
let you filter and view specific historical forecast data.
For example, consider that you specify the startDate as
2025-06-03T00:00:00.000Z , the endDate as
2025-10-02T00:00:00.000Z , and the generationDate as
2025-05-04T00:00:00.000Z . The API retrieves the forecast
snapshot that was calculated on May 4, 2025 and shows the
past forecast data starting from June 3, 2025 until October 2, 2025.
Note : If you don't specify a date for the generationDate field,
then the API retrieves the most recently generated forecast snapshot.
For more information, see the Data availability and updates section.
