Dry run mode for service perimeters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
When using VPC Service Controls, it can be difficult to determine the impact to
your environment when a service perimeter is created or modified. With dry run
mode, you can better understand the effect of enabling VPC Service Controls and
changes to perimeters in existing environments.
In the dry run mode, requests that violate the perimeter
policy are not denied, only logged. You can use the dry run mode
to test perimeter configuration and to monitor usage of services without
preventing access to resources. The common use cases include the following:
Determining the impact that changes to existing service perimeters will
have.
Previewing the impact that new service perimeters will have.
Monitoring requests to protected services that originate from outside a
service perimeter. For example, seeing where requests to a given service
are coming from, or to identify unexpected service usage in your
organization.
In your development environments, creating an analogous perimeter
architecture to your production environment. This allows you to identify
and mitigate any issues that will be caused by your service perimeters
before pushing changes to your production environment.
Service perimeters can exist using dry run mode exclusively. You can also have
service perimeters that use a hybrid of enforced and dry run modes.
Benefits of dry run mode
Using dry run mode, you can create new service perimeters or change multiple
existing perimeters with no impact to an existing environment. Requests that
violate the new perimeter configuration are not blocked. You can also understand
the impact of the perimeter in an environment where not all services being used
are integrated with VPC Service Controls.
You can analyze the VPC Service Controls logs for denials, change the configuration
to fix potential issues, and then enforce the new security posture.
If issues with the perimeter configuration cannot be resolved, you can choose to
keep your perimeter's dry run configuration and monitor the logs for unexpected
denials that may indicate an exfiltration attempt. Requests to the perimeter are
not denied, however.
Dry run mode concepts
Dry run mode operates as a second evaluation pass of the perimeter
configuration. By default, the enforced mode configuration for all service
perimeters is inherited into the dry run mode configuration, where the
configuration can be modified or deleted without impacting the operation of
the service perimeter.
Because dry run mode inherits the enforced mode configuration, at each step
both configurations must be valid. In particular, a project can only be
in one perimeter in the enforced configuration and one perimeter in the dry run
configuration. As a result, changes that span multiple perimeters, such as
moving a project between perimeters, must be
sequenced in the proper order .
Dry run mode only logs a request if it meets both the following criteria:
The request is not already denied by the perimeter's dry run or enforced configuration.
The request violates the perimeter's dry run configuration.
For example, if identical dry run and enforced mode configurations restrict a
Cloud Storage bucket, the enforced mode blocks and logs any request to the
Cloud Storage bucket. The dry run mode only logs the differences in violations
compared to the enforced mode.
In the audit logs of a dry run mode policy check, the metadata.dryRun
field's value in the audit log is set to True . For more information, see
Audit log record content .
You can also create perimeters that have only a dry run configuration. This
allows you to simulate the impact of a new enforced perimeter in your
environment.
To evaluate the dry run configuration of a service perimeter, set the
useExplicitDryRunSpec field in the service perimeter configuration to True .
For more information, see accessPolicies.servicePerimeters .
Note: The usage of perimeter resources, ingress rules, and egress rules in the dry
run mode also contributes to the overall quota utilization of the access policy
limits. For more information, see Quotas and
limits .
Policy semantics
The following section describes the policy relationship between enforced and
dry run mode, and what order enforcement is resolved in.
Unique membership constraint
A Google Cloud project can be included only in one enforced configuration and
one dry run configuration. However, the enforced and dry run configurations
do not need to be for the same perimeter. This allows you to test the impact of
moving a project from one perimeter to another without compromising the security
currently applied to the project.
Example
Project corp-storage is currently protected by the enforced configuration of
perimeter PA. You want to test the impact of moving corp-storage to perimeter
PB.
The dry run configuration for PA hasn't been modified yet. Because the dry
run configuration is unmodified, it inherits corp-storage from the enforced
configuration.
To test the impact, you first remove corp-storage from the dry run
configuration for PA and add the project to the dry run configuration for PB.
You have to remove corp-storage from the dry run configuration for PA first
because projects can only exist in one dry run configuration at a time.
When you are satisfied that migrating corp-storage from PA to PB will not
have adverse effects on your security posture, you decide to enforce the
changes.
There are two ways to enforce the changes to perimeters PA and PB:
You can manually remove corp-storage from the enforced
configuration for PA and add the project to the enforced configuration for
PB. Because corp-storage can only be in a single enforced configuration at
a time, you need to perform the steps in this order.
-or-
You can use the gcloud command-line tool or the Access Context Manager API to
enforce all dry run configurations. This operation applies to all modified
dry run configurations for your perimeters, so you would want to coordinate
the operation with anyone else in your organization who has modified dry
run configurations for your perimeters. Because the dry run configuration
for PA already excludes corp-storage , no additional steps are required.
The enforced configuration of a perimeter is executed first
Only requests that are allowed by the enforced configuration of a perimeter
but denied by the dry run configuration are logged as dry run policy
violations. Requests that are denied by the enforced configuration but would be
allowed by the dry run configuration are not logged.
Access levels do not have a dry run mode equivalent
While you can create a dry run configuration for a perimeter, access levels
do not have a dry run configuration. In practice, this means if you want to test
how a change to an access level would affect your dry run configuration, you
must:
Create an access level that reflects the changes you want to make to an
existing access level.
Apply the new access level to the dry run configuration for the perimeter.
Dry run mode does not have a negative impact on security
Changes to a dry run configuration for a perimeter, such as adding new projects
or access levels to a perimeter, or changing what services are protected or
accessible to networks inside the perimeter, have no impact on the actual
enforcement of a perimeter.
For example, assume you have a project that belongs to service perimeter PA. If
the project is added to the dry run configuration of another perimeter, the
actual security applied to the project does not change. The project continues to
be protected by the enforced configuration of perimeter PA, as expected.
Dry run actions and configuration statuses
Using the dry run feature, you can:
Create a perimeter with only a dry run configuration
Update an existing perimeter's dry run configuration
Move a new project into an existing perimeter
Move a project from one perimeter to another
Delete a perimeter's dry run configuration
Based on the action taken in dry run mode, a perimeter can be in one of the
following configuration statuses:
Inherited from enforced: Default state for enforced perimeters. In this
state, any changes to the perimeter's enforced configuration are also applied
to the dry run configuration.
Modified: The dry run configuration for a perimeter has been viewed or
changed, and then saved. In this state, changes to the enforced configuration
of a perimeter are not applied to the dry run configuration.
New: The perimeter has only a dry run configuration. Even if changes are
made to the dry run configuration, until this perimeter has an enforced
configuration, the status remains New .
Deleted : The dry run configuration for the perimeter has been deleted. This
status remains until you create a new dry run configuration for the perimeter
or undo the action. In this state, changes to the enforced configuration
of a perimeter are not applied to the dry run configuration.
Limitations of dry run mode
Dry run mode only applies to perimeters. It does not help understand the impact
of restricting Google Cloud API access to the
restricted or private VIP . We recommend ensuring that
all services that you want to use are available on the restricted VIP before you
configure the restricted.googleapis.com domain.
If you're unsure whether the APIs you're using in an existing environment are
supported by the restricted VIP, we recommend using the private VIP. You can
still enforce perimeter security for supported services. However, if you use
the private VIP, entities within your network will have access to unsecured
services (services that are not supported by VPC Service Controls), such as the
consumer versions of Gmail and Drive. Because the private VIP allows services
that aren't supported by VPC Service Controls, it is possible for compromised code,
malware, or a malicious user within your network to exfiltrate data using those
unsecured services.
