Troubleshoot common issues
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page lists various issues that you might encounter when configuring
VPC Service Controls.
Unexpected scoped policy behavior
You might notice some unexpected VPC Service Controls violations that your
scoped policy should allow. It is a known issue that if you don't have an
organization-level access policy, then you might experience some unexpected
issues with your scoped access policies.
To overcome this issue, create an access policy at the organization level using
the following command:
gcloud access - context - manager policies create -- organization < var>ORGANIZATION_ID < / var > -- title < var>POLICY_TITLE < / var >
Replace the following:
ORGANIZATION_ID : The organization ID.
POLICY_TITLE : A human-readable title for your access policy.
For more information, see Create an access policy .
Shared VPC
When using Shared VPC, a service perimeter that includes projects that belong
to a Shared VPC network must also include the project that hosts the network.
When projects that belong to a Shared VPC network are not in the same perimeter
as the host project, services might not work as expected or might be blocked entirely.
Ensure that the Shared VPC network host is in the same service perimeter as
the projects connected to the network.
Unable to add a VPC network
The following error can occur when you try to add a VPC network
to a service perimeter:
ERROR: (gcloud.access-context-manager.perimeters.update) PERMISSION_DENIED: Permission 'compute.networks.get' denied on resource '//compute.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_NAME /global/networks/ VPC_NETWORK_NAME ' (or it may not exist)
This error occurs due to one of the following reasons:
The VPC network doesn't exist.
The VPC network exists, but doesn't have a subnet.
The caller doesn't have the required permission.
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps:
Verify if the VPC network specified in the error message
exists by viewing the
networks in your
project.
Before verifying the VPC network, make sure that the
Compute Engine API is enabled in the project associated with the API call
by completing the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the APIs & Services page. Go
to APIs & Services
On the APIs & Services page, verify if the Compute Engine API is
listed.
If the Compute Engine API is missing, enable the API. Enable the
API
Verify if at least one subnet exists in the VPC network by
viewing the
subnets . If
there are no subnets, add a
subnet to the
VPC network.
Check if the caller has the following permission on the host project of the
VPC network: compute.networks.get . This permission lets you
view VPC networks in a project.
Ask the administrator of the organization that owns the host project of
the VPC network to grant the caller an IAM
role with the compute.networks.get permission on the host project. For
example, the Compute Network Viewer role.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage
access .
Ensure that you read the
limitations
associated with using VPC networks in service perimeters.
Requests between perimeters
Normally, access levels are used to allow requests from outside a service
perimeter for protected resources inside a perimeter.
However, a request from a project in a perimeter for a protected resource
in another perimeter is denied, even if an access level normally allows the request.
For example, assume Project A in Perimeter 1 requests a resource from Project B.
The resource in Project B is protected by Perimeter 2. Because Project A is in
a perimeter, even if an access level for Perimeter 2 normally permits the
request for the protected resource, the request is denied.
Use one of the following approaches to facilitate requests between perimeters:
Use egress policy and ingress policy .
To allow requests from another perimeter to protected resources in
your perimeter, the other perimeter must use an egress policy and you must set an ingress policy in your perimeter.
Use perimeter bridges .
Bridges allow two or more projects in different perimeters to make requests
to any services in those projects. These requests are permitted even if the
services are protected by the respective perimeters.
Ensure that both the requesting service and the target resource are
unprotected by the perimeters. In this scenario, the operation succeeds
because the services are not protected.
The email address is invalid or non-existent
When updating a perimeter that contains a deleted principal, you might encounter
the The email address is invalid or non-existent error.
To fix this issue, you must remove the invalid email address from all
perimeters:
Export all your perimeters .
The following sample command exports a list of service perimeters in YAML format:
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters list \
--policy = POLICY_NAME \
--format = "json(name,title,description,perimeterType,status,spec,useExplicitDryRunSpec)" \
> my-perimeters.yaml
Remove the invalid email address from the my-perimeters.yaml file and
save it as my-perimeters-updated.yaml .
Bulk replace all your perimeters .
Ingress and egress rules violations
The audit log contains information about the ingress and egress rules violations
that help you understand perimeter violations.
Ingress rule violation
An ingress rule violation indicates that an API client outside of the perimeter
tried to access a resource inside the perimeter. The service perimeter rejects
the request as there are no matching ingress rules or access levels.
An ingress rule violation in the audit log contains the following details:
The name of the perimeter in which the ingress rule violation occurred.
The resource inside the perimeter that the API client outside the perimeter
tried to access.
In the following ingress rule violation example, an API client outside the
perimeter tries to access the Cloud Storage bucket prod-protected-storage-bucket inside the
perimeter prod-perimeter .
ingressViolations: [
0: {
targetResource: "projects/1234/buckets/prod-protected-storage-bucket"
servicePerimeter: "accessPolicies/123456789/servicePerimeters/prod-perimeter"
}
]
To resolve this issue, create an ingress rule
for your perimeter. For more information about ingress rules, see Ingress rules
reference .
Egress rule violation
An egress rule violation in the audit log indicates one of the following events:
An API client inside the perimeter tried to access a resource outside the
perimeter.
An API request that involves a resource inside the perimeter and a resource
outside the perimeter. For example, a Cloud Storage client that calls a copy
command where one bucket is within the perimeter and the other bucket is
outside the perimeter.
The service perimeter rejects the request because there are no matching egress
rules.
An egress rule violation in the audit log includes the following details:
The source type such as network or resource.
The source, which is a resource or network, whose perimeter encountered an egress
violation.
The perimeter that encountered an egress violation.
The target resource outside the perimeter that the request tried to access.
In the following egress rule violation example, the API request includes a
resource from projects/5678, which is inside the perimeter prod-perimeter ,
and an object from the Cloud Storage bucket external-storage-bucket , which is
outside the perimeter.
egressViolations: [
0: {
sourceType: "Resource"
source: "projects/5678"
targetResource: "projects/4321/buckets/external-storage-bucket/objects/corp-resources.json"
servicePerimeter: "accessPolicies/123456789/servicePerimeters/prod-perimeter"
}
]
To resolve this issue, create an egress rule
for your perimeter. For more information about egress rules, see Egress rules
reference .
Debugging requests blocked by VPC Service Controls
The VPC Service Controls audit log is the primary tool for
debugging a request blocked by VPC Service Controls.
When access has been blocked unexpectedly, consult the audit logs
in the project protected by the service perimeter. These logs contain
significant data about the requested resources and the reason why the request
was denied. For information about diagnosing the audit logs, see Access the violation analyzer .
The following sections list the violationReason values that you might encounter
when using VPC Service Controls.
NETWORK_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER
The reason for this issue might be one of the following:
A client in a VPC network within a service perimeter tries to access a project
that is not in the same perimeter. This request results in an egress violation.
Create an egress rule to fix this issue.
A client in a VPC network that is outside a service perimeter tries to access
a project that is protected by the service perimeter. This request results in
an ingress violation. Create an ingress rule to fix this issue.
The client might send the request from a Compute Engine or Google Kubernetes Engine VM, or
from an on-premises network through Cloud Interconnect or a VPN configured using a VPC network.
The following diagram shows that an egress violation occurs when a client in a VPC
network within a service perimeter tries to access a project outside the perimeter:
Here is an example of an egress violation:
egressViolations: [
{
servicePerimeter: "accessPolicies/ <POLICY_NAME> /servicePerimeters/ <PERIMETER_NAME> "
source: "projects/ <NETWORK_PROJECT_NUMBER> "
sourceType: "Network"
targetResource: "projects/ <RESOURCE_PROJECT_NUMBER> "
}
]
Where:
<POLICY_NAME> is the numeric name of your access policy.
<PERIMETER_NAME> is the name of the service perimeter.
<NETWORK_PROJECT_NUMBER> is the project number of the Google Cloud project that holds your VPC network.
<RESOURCE_PROJECT_NUMBER> is the project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the resource.
The following diagram shows that an ingress violation occurs when a client outside
the perimeter tries to access a project inside the perimeter:
Here is an example of an ingress violation:
ingressViolations: [
{
targetResource: "projects/ <RESOURCE_PROJECT_NUMBER> ",
source: "projects/ <NETWORK_PROJECT_NUMBER> "
servicePerimeter: "accessPolicies/ <POLICY_NAME> /servicePerimeters/ <PERIMETER_NAME> "
}
]
Where:
<RESOURCE_PROJECT_NUMBER> is the project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the resource.
<NETWORK_PROJECT_NUMBER> is the project number of the Google Cloud project that holds your VPC network.
<POLICY_NAME> is the numeric name of your access policy.
<PERIMETER_NAME> is the name of the service perimeter.
Resolution
To resolve this error, create an ingress or egress
rule for your
perimeter.
RESOURCES_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER
This issue occurs when a single request is accessing multiple resources but the
resources are not in the same service perimeter. This issue occurs irrespective of
where the client is located and whether the client has access to the resources.
The following diagram shows a client accessing resources from a project outside the
perimeter and from a project within the service perimeter:
The following diagram shows a client accessing resources from projects which are
in two different service perimeters but the perimeters do not communicate with each other:
Here is an example of an egress violation:
egressViolations: [
{
servicePerimeter: "accessPolicies/ <POLICY_NAME> /servicePerimeters/ <PERIMETER_NAME> "
source: "projects/ <RESOURCE_PROJECT_INSIDE_THIS_PERIMETER> "
sourceType: "Resource"
targetResource: "projects/ <RESOURCE_PROJECT_OUTSIDE_THIS-PERIMETER> "
}
]
Where:
<POLICY_NAME> is the numeric name of your access policy.
<PERIMETER_NAME> is the name of the service perimeter.
<RESOURCE_PROJECT_INSIDE_THIS_PERIMETER> is the project number of the Google Cloud project that is within the perimeter.
<RESOURCE_PROJECT_OUTSIDE_THIS_PERIMETER> is the project number of the Google Cloud project that is outside the perimeter.
Resolution
To resolve this issue, create an egress rule for your perimeter .
NO_MATCHING_ACCESS_LEVEL
This issue occurs when the IP address, device requirement, or user identity
doesn't match any ingress rules or access levels assigned to the perimeter. This
means that a client that isn't a part of the Google Cloud network tries to
access Google Cloud network resources from outside the perimeter. For
example, the IP address corresponding to the callerIp field of the audit
record doesn't match any CIDR ranges defined in the access levels for the
service perimeter.
If the caller IP address is missing or appears as an internal IP address, then
this violation might be due to a Google Cloud service that isn't
integrated with VPC Service Controls. The reason could be that the
Google Cloud service tries to access a protected service and fails, as
expected.
To fix this issue, we recommend creating an ingress rule instead of an access
level because an ingress rule provides granular access control.
The following diagram shows a client trying to access resources from outside the
perimeter:
Here is an example of an ingress violation:
authenticationInfo: {
principalEmail: " EMAIL "
}
requestMetadata: {
callerIp: " <PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS> "
deviceState: "Cross Organization"
}
ingressViolations: [
{
targetResource: "projects/ <RESOURCE_PROJECT_NUMBER> ",
servicePerimeter: "accessPolicies/ <POLICY_NAME> /servicePerimeters/ <PERIMETER-NAME> "
}
]
Where:
<EMAIL> is the email address of the service account or authenticated user.
If you use a Google Cloud service that VPC Service Controls doesn't
support , email addresses that
belong to the domain google.com are redacted and replaced with
google-internal . google-internal refers to internal Google-owned identities.
<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS> is the IP address of the
caller. For a caller from the internet, this will be the public IPv4 or IPv6
address.
<RESOURCE_PROJECT_NUMBER> is the project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the resource.
<POLICY_NAME> is the numeric name of your access policy.
<PERIMETER_NAME> is the name of the service perimeter.
Note that in this case, metadata.accessLevels could still be present since
these access levels might not be specified in the violated perimeter.
SERVICE_NOT_ALLOWED_FROM_VPC
This issue occurs when a client tries to access Google Cloud resources from a VPC network.
The client might send the request from a Compute Engine or Google Kubernetes Engine VM,
or from an on-premises network through Cloud Interconnect or a VPN configured using a VPC network.
To fix this issue, ensure that the service being called is allowed by the VPC accessible
services configuration of the service perimeter.
Note: An API request that has a malformed resource field might cause a VPC Service Controls
violation based on the request fields. For example, if a Pub/Sub CreateTopic
request specifies the topic name topic123 instead of the full path projects/{project}/topics/topic123 ,
the RESOURCES_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER violation occurs.
Example scenarios
The following examples cover issues that you might encounter while using
VPC Service Controls.
Cloud Storage access from on-premises
BigQuery access from VM outside of project
Cross-project BigQuery query
Move Cloud Storage file inside perimeter
Move Cloud Storage file outside perimeter
BigQuery dataset copy from VM inside perimeter
Managed Service for Apache Spark job reading from project
Unsupported service with restricted VIP
Log export to project outside perimeter
BigQuery extract to Cloud Storage
Cloud Storage access from on-premises
In this example, VPC Service Controls blocks a request from an employee
workstation (identified by callerIp ) to a Cloud Storage bucket in project
corp-storage .
The request generates the following audit log record:
{
insertId : "222lvajc6f7"
logName : "projects/corp-storage/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com %2F policy"
protoPayload : {
@ type : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog"

}
]
}
]
message : "Request is prohibited by organization's policy"
}
}
receiveTimestamp : "2018-11-27T21:40:43.823209571Z"
resource : {

}

}
severity : "ERROR"
timestamp : "2018-11-27T21:40:42.973784140Z"
}
The corp-storage project is included in a service perimeter. The employee
workstation is not a part of any networks within that perimeter. Because the
employee workstation exists outside the perimeter, the request is blocked.
BigQuery access from VM outside of project
In this example, a VM that belongs to project 458854174376 ( data-collector )
attempts to run a BigQuery query against a dataset in project
798816221974 ( corp-resources-protected ) and it is denied.
The VM uses the following query:
bq --project = corp-resources-protected query 'select count(*) from babynames.yob2000'
The query returns the following output:
BigQuery error in query operation: VPC Service Controls: Request is
prohibited by organization's policy. Operation ID:
33643962-6a0f-4091-9283-bcdf7e9271f0
The following audit log record is generated:
{
insertId : "1ei551d2pdq"

}
]

}
}
receiveTimestamp : "2018-11-28T23:06:13.579882505Z"

}
type : "audited_resource"
}
severity : "ERROR"
timestamp : "2018-11-28T23:06:12.799656975Z"
}
In this example, the violationReason is
NETWORK_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER . callerNetwork is included in addition
to callerIp . The IP address is private and the network is provided to
disambiguate it. The relevant resources at issue here are listed in two places:
VpcServiceControlAuditMetadata.resourceNames and
requestMetadata.callerNetwork (the project that owns the network).
The problem is that the corp-resources-protected project is inside a service
perimeter, while data-collector , the project that includes the network that
the VM belongs to, is not. In this case, access is denied as expected.
Cross-project BigQuery query
In this example, a VM that belongs to the perimeter-network project
attempts to query the BigQuery instances of two different
projects: corp-resources-protected , which is in the same service perimeter as
perimeter-network , and corp-resources-public , which is not.
The VM uses the following command:
bq query --use_legacy_sql = false \
'select count(priv.name),count(pub.name) from \
`corp-resources-protected.babynames.yob2000` as priv, \
`corp-resources-public.babynames.yob2000` as pub'
The query returns the following output:
BigQuery error in query operation: Error processing job
'example:bqjob_r211e6f6eec928ffb_000001675c996aa8_1': VPC Service Controls:

Looking at callerNetwork and
VpcServiceControlAuditMetadata.resourceNames , we can see three projects:
perimeter-network , 117961063178 ( corp-resources-public ), and 690885588241
( corp-resources-protected ). Recall that corp-resources-public is not in
the same service perimeter as perimeter-network and corp-resources-protected .
The violationReason , RESOURCES_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER indicates that
some resource in the request is outside of a perimeter that applies to the
request. In this case, that resource is corp-resources-public .
Move Cloud Storage file inside perimeter
In this example, a VM in project perimeter-network uses a command to move a
file from one Cloud Storage bucket, located in project
corp-resources-protected , to another bucket, located in project
corp-resources-public .
The VM uses the following command:
gcloud storage mv gs://corp-resources-private-1/yob2000.txt gs://corp-resources-public-1/babynames/
The command returns the following output:
Copying gs://corp-resources-private-1/yob2000.txt [Content-Type=text/plain]...
AccessDeniedException: 403 Request violates VPC Service Controls.
The following audit log record is generated:
{

}
type : "audited_resource"
}
severity : "ERROR"
timestamp : "2018-11-28T00:45:31.351140381Z"
}
In this case, the log is less clear because the method listed is
BillingRequiredRead and the action taken is move . This is a limitation of
VPC Service Controls's present audit log functionality.
While the reason is less clear, this audit log record indicates that
some resource in the request is outside of a perimeter that applies to the
request. In this case, that resource is corp-resources-public .
Move Cloud Storage file outside perimeter
In this example, a VM in project public-network uses a command to move a
file from one Cloud Storage bucket, located in project
corp-resources-protected , to another bucket, located in project
corp-resources-public .
The corp-resources-protected project is protected by a service perimeter. The
public-network and corp-resources-public projects exist outside the
perimeter.
The VM uses the following command:
gcloud storage mv gs://corp-resources-private-1/yob2000.txt gs://corp-resources-public-1/babynames/
The command returns the following output:
Copying gs://corp-resources-private-1/yob2000.txt [Content-Type=text/plain]...

In this example, the audit log indicates that one cannot copy data across the
boundary of a service perimeter (both resources are in the audit log record).
Recall that the request originates from outside the perimeter (the VM in
public-network ), and that one of the buckets exists outside the perimeter
( corp-resources-public-1 ).
From outside the perimeter, one is able to write to bucket
corp-resources-public-1 , so the check that failed in the
previous example passes. However, the subsequent check
to actually copy the data fails.
This example demonstrates how sometimes a single user operation results in
multiple internal operations that must pass VPC Service Controls enforcement.
BigQuery dataset copy from VM inside perimeter
In this example, a VM in project 927005422713 ( perimeter-network ) tries to
copy a BigQuery dataset from project corp-resources-private
to corp-resources-public ( 117961063178 ). perimeter-network and
corp-resources-private share a perimeter, while corp-resources-public exists
outside the perimeter.
The VM uses the following command:
bq cp corp-resources-private:babynames.yob2000 \
corp-resources-public:babynames.yob2000
The command returns the following output:
BigQuery error in cp operation: VPC Service Controls: Request is prohibited by
organization's policy. Operation ID: c00dbc44-460f-4bd0-9d09-cda98ac800f9

}
In this example, there is no single underlying API action that shows all the
resources at play in this request due to limitations of the logging mechanism
and the distributed architecture of BigQuery.
The audit log record indicates that the operation failed because in order to
copy the data, BigQuery must access the target project
( corp-resources-public ) using the network in project perimeter-network
(the source of the request). Recall that corp-resources-public is outside
the perimeter that protects perimeter-network . The request is denied as an
attempt to exfiltrate data to corp-resources-public .
This example illustrates that one conceptual operation, such as copying data,
can trigger multiple attempts to access data from different storage systems,
such as Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and
Bigtable. Based on how the operation is executed, the generated
audit log record differs from the original user command. Also, when multiple
checks within a given service are made and potentially fail, the generated audit
log record looks different from the original user command.
Managed Service for Apache Spark job reading from project
This example shows how to debug indirect VPC Service Controls errors that
occur when using data processing services like Managed Service for Apache Spark.
In this example, a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster is running in a project
protected by VPC Service Controls. Hello-world.py is a pyspark job that
attempts to access data from Cloud Storage bucket inside the perimeter
and then write it to another bucket that exists outside the perimeter.
VPC Service Controls blocks the operation that writes data to a bucket
outside the perimeter.
The following command is used to execute Hello-world.py :
gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark hello-world.py --cluster test-cluster-new2
The command returns the following output:
Job [ 50f 16 ca8 -5102-442 b - a545 - eed5e4f5f5da ] submitted .

Cloud Storage returns a 403 error with the message

Due to audit log limitations, the methodName for Cloud Storage
is listed as Read even though it is actually a write operation. The audit
log record indicates that the operation failed because a network in project
corp-resources-private was attempting to access the data (writing, in this
case) of a resource in bucket corp-resources-public-1 . Due to the limitations
of the Cloud Storage audit log, it is not clear which project bucket
corp-resources-public-1 belongs to.
To identify the project that contains corp-resources-public-1 , use the
following command:
gcloud storage ls gs://corp-resources-public-1 --buckets --log-http 2>&1 | grep projectNumber
The command returns the following output:
"projectNumber": "117961063178",
117961063178 is project corp-resources-public , which is outside perimeter.
Thus, the failure is expected.
Error due to unsupported services
Some Google Cloud services depend on other Google Cloud services as
part of their implementation. If an unsupported service such as
App Engine is used inside a project that is protected by a perimeter, the
service's resources might not be accessible.
For information about known problematic cases, see
Known service limitations .
Unsupported service with restricted VIP
Attempting to access an API that is not supported by the VPC Service Controls
restricted VIP results in a 403 error. For example, VPC Service Controls
does not support App Engine, so the App Engine Admin API is
not available when using the restricted VIP.
For example, suppose the following command is used to list all App Engine
services within a service perimeter:
gcloud app services list
The command returns the following output:
ERROR: (gcloud.app.services.list) User [***] does not have permission to access apps instance [***] (or it may not exist): <!DOCTYPE html>

This type of error is expected for services that are not supported by
VPC Service Controls and not available on the restricted VIP. If this error
occurs for a service that is supported by VPC Service Controls, then we
recommend that you check the known service
limitations
for that service to see if it is a known limitation. Otherwise, the issue must
be reported .
Log export to project outside perimeter
In this example, a log export is blocked by VPC Service Controls.
The export destination, project corp-resources-public , is outside of the
VPC Service Controls perimeter, while the sink is created on project
perimeter-network , which is inside the perimeter.
Note: This example specifically describes a log export to
BigQuery, but exports to other features, such as
Cloud Storage and Pub/Sub behave the same way.
For example, suppose the following command is used:
gcloud logging sinks describe example-sink
The command returns the following output:
destination : bigquery . googleapis . com / projects / corp - resources - public / datasets / logs
filter : |-
resource . type = "audited_resource"
resource . labels . service = "bigquery.googleapis.com"
name : example - sink

}
The audit log record is generated for BigQuery, not for
Logging. This is because BigQuery is the sink
service that Logging is attempting to write to.
The export fails because corp-resources-public exists outside the perimeter
that protects perimeter-network .
This example shows that for cases where one Google Cloud service calls
another using a managed service account that is internal to Google Cloud,
such as
p927005422713-439672@gcp-sa-logging.iam.gserviceaccount.com , the "network
project" (in this case, perimeter-network ) of the request is derived from that
identity. The same identity represents the log export resource itself.
This pattern is common in Google Cloud and applies to numerous cases of
service-to-service interaction.
BigQuery extract to Cloud Storage
This example describes how to debug failed BigQuery extractions
to Cloud Storage.
In this example, corp-resources-private and perimeter-network are projects
protected by a service perimeter. corp-resources-public is a project that
exists outside the perimeter.
Suppose the following command was used:
bq extract babynames.yob2000
The command returns the following output:
gs : // corp - resources - public - 1 / export . txt
Waiting on bqjob_r47ee34109d02b41_000001676b27157c_1 ... ( 1 s ) Current status : DONE
BigQuery error in extract operation : Error processing job 'corp-resources-private:bqjob_r47ee34109d02b41_000001676b27157c_1' : Access
Denied : BigQuery BigQuery : Permission denied while writing data .
In this case, the error does not specifically implicate VPC Service Controls.
A similar error is shown if there is an Identity and Access Management failure.

In this audit log record, storage-accessing@example.iam.gserviceaccount.com is
identified as the identity attempting to run the operation. In this example,
assume that storage-accessing@example.iam.gserviceaccount.com has the required
IAM permissions to execute the command.
As IAM permissions are not the issue, the next step is to
check for VPC Service Controls failures.
The audit log record for the destination service (Cloud Storage)
contains detailed reasons for the failure:

From this log, it is clear that the two projects 1004338142803
( corp-resources-private-1 ) and corp-resources-public are both being used to
complete the command. Because those projects do not share a perimeter, the
extract job fails.
This example illustrates that in complex multi-service operations, the audit
logs for both the source and destination services might contain useful debugging
data.
Perimeter access through Cloud NAT gateway
In this example, assume that project A from Org A is not configured within any
perimeter. Project B is secured by a perimeter in a different organization.
Private resources on project A use Cloud NAT gateway to reach the
internet and Google APIs and services. An access level is configured on project
B to allow access based on the external gateway IP addresses of project A.
A VM that belongs to project A (which can be a Google Kubernetes Engine node)
attempts to access a protected resource in project B but the connection fails,
and the following audit log record is generated in project B:

The callerIp resource does not record an external IP address. Instead of
the Cloud NAT gateway external IP address, the callerIp resource
shows gce-internal-ip .
The callerIp field is redacted to gce-internal-ip when the requests
originate from a different project or organization and the source
Compute Engine VM does not have an external IP address.
Cloud NAT has
an integration with Private Google Access
that automatically enables Private Google Access on the resource's subnet,
and keeps the traffic to Google APIs and services internal as opposed to
routing it to the internet using the Cloud NAT gateway external
IP address.
In this case, as the traffic is routed within the internal Google network, the
RequestMetadata.caller_ip field of the AuditLog object is redacted to
gce-internal-ip . To fix this, instead of using the Cloud NAT
gateway external IP address in the access level for IP-based allowlist ,
configure an ingress rule to allow from the project or service account.
