Example of using identity groups and third-party identities in ingress and egress rules
Stay organized with collections

This page shows how to use identity groups and third-party identities in
ingress and egress rules .
This page contains the following example of using identity groups in ingress
and egress rules:
Allow Cloud Run access to an identity group's members through
the internet and to specific service accounts from an allowlisted IP address
range.
Allow Cloud Run access to an identity group's members and to specific service accounts
The following diagram shows a user from a specific identity group and from the
allowlisted IP address range accesses Cloud Run inside a service
perimeter:
Figure 1. An example of providing Cloud Run access using an identity group.
Consider that you have defined the following service perimeter:
name: accessPolicies/222/servicePerimeters/Example
status:
resources:
- projects/111
restrictedServices:
- run.googleapis.com
- artifactregistry.googleapis.com
vpcAccessibleServices:
enableRestriction: true
allowedServices:
- RESTRICTED_SERVICES
title: Example
To find details about an existing service perimeter in your organization,
describe the service
perimeter
using the gcloud CLI command.
In this example, we also assume that you have defined the following resources:
An identity group called allowed-users@example.com that has users who you
want to provide access to Cloud Run inside the perimeter.
An access level called CorpDatacenters in the same access policy as the
service perimeter. CorpDatacenters includes an allowlisted IP address
range of the corporate data centers where requests from service accounts can
originate from.
The following ingress policy, ingress.yaml , allows Cloud Run
access to specific human accounts, who are part of the
allowed-users@example.com group, and specific service accounts, that are
limited to the allowlisted IP address range:
- ingressFrom:
identities:
- serviceAccount:my-sa@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
sources:
- accessLevel: accessPolicies/222/accessLevels/CorpDatacenters
ingressTo:
operations:
- serviceName: run.googleapis.com
methodSelectors:
- method: "*"
resources:
- "*"
- ingressFrom:
identities:
- group:allowed-users@example.com
sources:
- accessLevel: "*"
ingressTo:
operations:
- serviceName: run.googleapis.com
methodSelectors:
- method: "*"
resources:
- "*"
To apply the ingress rule, run the following command:
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update Example --set-ingress-policies=ingress.yaml
