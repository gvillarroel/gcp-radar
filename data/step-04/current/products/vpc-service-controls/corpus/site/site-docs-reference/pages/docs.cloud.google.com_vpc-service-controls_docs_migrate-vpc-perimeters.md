Example migration of VPC networks into separate perimeters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This example shows how you can migrate VPC networks of an existing
host project, which is already in a service perimeter, into separate perimeters.
In this example, the host project consists of two VPC networks.
Two service projects host their Cloud Storage resources.
The following diagram shows the perimeter configuration of an example host project
before the migration:
The architecture diagram shows the following components:
Host project . The host project contains two VPC networks
VPC1 and VPC2 .
Service projects . The service projects service-project-1 and service-project-2
contain Cloud Storage buckets and are protected by the service perimeter.
Perimeter . The service perimeter perimeter-1 protects the entire host
project and service projects. The VM VM1 in VPC network VPC1
and the VM VM2 in VPC network VPC2 can access resources in
both service-project-1 and service-project-2 .
The following diagram shows the perimeter configuration of the host project after
the migration.
The architecture diagram shows the following components:
Perimeter-1 . This perimeter protects the VPC network VPC1
and the service project service-project-1 . The VM VM1 can access the Cloud Storage
bucket in service-project-1 but cannot access the Cloud Storage bucket
in service-project-2 .
Perimeter-2 . This perimeter protects the VPC network VPC2
and the service project service-project-2 . The VM VM2 can access the Cloud Storage
bucket in service-project-2 but cannot access the Cloud Storage bucket
in service-project-1 .
In this migration example, the configuration changes are made in dry-run mode and
then verified before enforcing the dry-run configuration. This process ensures that
the VPC networks and resources are protected and the production traffic
from VPC1 to service-project-1 and from VPC2 to service-project-2 is not
disrupted during the migration.
The migration process consists of the following steps:
Get the VPC networks and perimeter details
Set up a dry-run perimeter configuration
Verify the dry-run setup
Enforce the dry-run configuration
Get the VPC networks and perimeter details
In this example, before you start the migration, you must get the list of VPC
networks and perimeter details.
List the VPC networks in the host project
The following command lists the VPC networks in the network-host-project:
gcloud compute networks list --project=network-host-project
This example produces the following output:
NAME SUBNET_MODE BGP_ROUTING_MODE IPV4_RANGE GATEWAY_IPV4
vpc1 AUTO REGIONAL
vpc2 AUTO REGIONAL
Get the perimeter details
The following command gets the details of the perimeter:
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters describe perimeter-1
This example produces the following output:
name: accessPolicies/<access policy number>/servicePerimeters/perimeter-1
status:
…
resources:
- projects/<network-host-project number>
- projects/<service-project-1 number>
- projects/<service-project-2 number>
The <access policy number> is used in the example dry-run mode commands.
You can also set up a default access policy with the following command:
gcloud alpha config set access_context_manager/policy<access policy number>
Set up a dry-run configuration
In this example, you use the dry-run command to update the perimeter perimeter-1
to remove network-host-project , service-project-2 , and add VPC1 . Then, you
run the dry-run command to create a new perimeter perimeter-2 and add service-project-2
and VPC2 .
If you add a project to a perimeter in a different access policy, you must first remove
the project from the perimeters in the existing access policy. For information about
how to remove a project from a perimeter, see Update a service perimeter .
Update the dry-run configuration
The following command updates the perimeter perimeter-1 to remove network-host-project ,
service-project-2 , and adds VPC1 :
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters dry-run update perimeter-1
--remove-resources="projects/<network-host-project number>,projects/<service-project-2 number>"
--add-resources="//compute.googleapis.com/projects/network-host-project/global/networks/vpc1"
--policy=<access policy number>
Create a new perimeter in dry-run mode
The following command creates the perimeter perimeter-2 and adds service-project-2 ,
and adds VPC2 :
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters dry-run create perimeter-2
--title=perimeter-2 --type="regular"
--resources="projects/<service-project-2 number>,//compute.googleapis.com/projects/network-host-project/global/networks/vpc2"
--restricted-services="storage.googleapis.com"
--policy=<access policy number>
Verify the dry-run configuration
In this example, run the following commands to ensure that there are no dry-run errors
from VPC1 to service-project-1 , and from VPC2 to service-project-2 :
To list the Cloud Storage buckets in service-project-1 , log in to VM1 , which is in VPC1
and run the following command:
gcloud storage ls --project=service-project-1
To list the Cloud Storage buckets in service-project-2 , run the following command:
gcloud storage ls --project=service-project-2
The commands run successfully because the dry-run configuration doesn't affect production
traffic. However, the following dry-run error appears in the audit logs for network-host-project
for accessing service-project-2 from VM1 :
egressViolations: [
0: {
servicePerimeter: "accessPolicies/<access policy number>/servicePerimeters/perimeter-1"
source: "//compute.googleapis.com/projects/network-host-project/global/networks/VPC1"
sourceType: "Network"
targetResource: "projects/<service-project-2 number>"
}
]
Similarly, Cloud Storage requests from VM2 to service-project-2 don't have dry-run errors,
and requests from VM2 to service-project-1 have the following dry-run error in
the audit logs for the network-host-project :
egressViolations: [
0: {
servicePerimeter: "accessPolicies/<access policy number>/servicePerimeters/perimeter-2"
source: "//compute.googleapis.com/projects/network-host-project/global/networks/VPC2"
sourceType: "Network"
targetResource: "projects/<service-project-1 number>"
}
]
Enforce the dry-run configuration
You must enforce all dry-run configurations at once in one atomic transaction.
Note: When you enforce a dry-run configuration, all dry-run configurations within
the access policy are enforced. Make sure that the dry-run configurations of all perimeters
in the access policy are consistent with the enforced configurations.
To enforce the dry-run configurations, run the following command:
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters dry-run enforce-all --policy=<access policy number>
After you enforce the dry-run configurations, run the following command to describe
perimeter-1 :
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters describe perimeter-1 --policy=<access policy number>
This example produces the following output in which network-host-project and service-project-2
are removed, and VPC1 is added to perimeter-1 .
name: accessPolicies/<access policy number>/servicePerimeters/perimeter-1
status:
…
resources:
- projects/<service-project-1 number>
- //compute.googleapis.com/projects/<network-host-project>/global/networks/VPC1
Run the following command to describe perimeter-2 :
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters describe perimeter-2 --policy=<access policy number>
This example produces the following output in which service-project-2 and VPC2
are added to perimeter-2 .
name: accessPolicies/<access policy number>/servicePerimeters/perimeter-2
status:
…
resources:
- projects/<service-project-2 number>
- //compute.googleapis.com/projects/<network-host-project>/global/networks/VPC2
title: perimeter-2
