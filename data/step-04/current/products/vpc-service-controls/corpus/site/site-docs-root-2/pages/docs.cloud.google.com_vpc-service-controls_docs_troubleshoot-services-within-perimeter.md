Troubleshoot common VPC Service Controls issues with Google Cloud services
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides solutions to issues that you might encounter when using a
Google Cloud service that is within a VPC Service Controls perimeter.
Cloud Build issues
Using Cloud Build resources within a VPC Service Controls perimeter has
some known limitations. For more information, see Limitations of using
VPC Service Controls with
Cloud Build .
Cloud Build service account blocked from accessing protected resources
Cloud Build uses the Cloud Build service account to execute builds on
your behalf. By default, when you run a build on Cloud Build, the build
runs in a tenant project outside of your project.
The worker VMs of Cloud Build that generate build outputs are outside of
the VPC Service Controls perimeter, even if your project is inside the
perimeter. Therefore, for your builds to access resources within the perimeter,
you must grant the Cloud Build service account access to the
VPC Service Controls perimeter by either adding it to the access
level or ingress rule .
For more information, see Granting the Cloud Build service account access
to the VPC Service Controls
perimeter .
Cloud Storage issues
Denials when targeting a non-existent logging Cloud Storage bucket
If the specified logging bucket doesn't exist, VPC Service Controls denies
access with the RESOURCES_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER violation reason.
You can review the log of the access denial using the VPC Service Controls
Unique Identifier ( vpcServiceControlUniqueIdentifier ). The following is a
sample log with the RESOURCES_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER violation reason:
"serviceName": "storage.googleapis.com",
"methodName": "google.storage.buckets.update",
"resourceName": "projects/325183452875",
"metadata": {
"violationReason": "RESOURCES_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER",
...
"egressViolations": [
{
"sourceType": "Resource",
"targetResource": "projects/0/buckets/this-bucket-does-not-exist",
"source": "projects/325183452875/buckets/bucket-in-same-project",
"servicePerimeter": "accessPolicies/875573620132/servicePerimeters/prod_perimeter"
}]}
If the targetResource field in the egressViolations object shows a target
with projects/0/buckets , then this always triggers a denial as projects/0
doesn't exist and it is considered outside the service perimeter.
Denials when accessing Google-owned public Cloud Storage buckets
A service perimeter cannot contain projects from different organizations. A
perimeter can only contain projects from its parent organization. There are
certain limitations when you want to access Cloud Storage buckets from
projects within a VPC Service Controls perimeter that resides in a different
organization.
A typical example is when you want to access Google-owned Cloud Storage
buckets. Since your project and the Google-owned project that contains the
target bucket aren't in the same perimeter, VPC Service Controls denies the
request with the RESOURCES_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER violation reason.
To resolve this issue, you can create ingress and egress rules.
Accessing a publicly accessible Cloud Storage bucket from within a perimeter
If you are trying to access a publicly accessible Cloud Storage bucket from
within a service perimeter, VPC Service Controls might block your requests
by throwing an egress violation.
In order to ensure consistent successful access to the object as needed, we
should apply an egress rule to the affected service perimeter.
Security Command Center issues
This section lists the issues you might encounter while using Security Command Center
resources that are inside a VPC Service Controls perimeter.
Security Command Center blocked from sending notification to Pub/Sub
Trying to publish Security Command Center notifications to a Pub/Sub
topic inside a VPC Service Controls perimeter fails with a
RESOURCES_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER violation.
We recommend activating Security Command Center at the organization-level.
VPC Service Controls doesn't consider a parent organization as part of its
child projects' perimeter. For this to work, you must grant perimeter access to
Security Command Center.
As a workaround, you can do either of the following:
Use a Pub/Sub topic in a project that isn't in a service
perimeter.
Remove the Pub/Sub API from the service perimeter until the
notification setup is complete.
For more information about enabling Security Command Center notifications that are
sent to a Pub/Sub topic, see Enabling finding notifications for
Pub/Sub .
Security Command Center blocked from scanning Compute Engine resources inside a perimeter
Security Command Center scans Compute Engine resources in your projects using the
per-product, per-project service account (P4SA)
service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-computescanning.iam.gserviceaccount.com . In
order for Security Command Center to be able to access resources inside the perimeter,
the P4SA needs to be added into your access level or ingress rule.
Otherwise, you might see a NO_MATCHING_ACCESS_LEVEL error.
Security Command Center blocked from scanning resources inside a service perimeter
Security Health Analytics scans resources in your projects using the P4SA (per-product,
per-project service account)
service-org- ORGANIZATION_ID @security-center-api.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
In order for Security Command Center to be able to access resources inside the
perimeter, the P4SA account needs to be added into your access level or ingress
rule. Otherwise, you will see the NO_MATCHING_ACCESS_LEVEL error.
Google Kubernetes Engine issues
This section lists the issues you might encounter while using Google Kubernetes Engine
resources that are inside a VPC Service Controls perimeter.
Autoscaler not working in perimeters with accessible services and restricted services enabled
The autoscaling.googleapis.com isn't integrated with
VPC Service Controls, therefore it cannot be added to the restricted services
neither to the accessible services. It isn't possible to allow the
autoscaling.googleapis.com API in the accessible services. Therefore, the
autoscaler of clusters that exist in a perimeter with
accessible services enabled might not work.
We suggest against using accessible services. When using restricted Virtual IP
(VIP), make an exception for autoscaling.googleapis.com to go to Private VIP
in a perimeter that contains a cluster with autoscaling.
BigQuery issues
This section lists the issues you might encounter while using BigQuery
resources that are inside a VPC Service Controls perimeter.
VPC Service Controls perimeter restrictions don't apply to BigQuery query result export
If you are trying to restrict the export of protected data from
BigQuery to Google Drive, Google Sheets, or Looker Studio, you
might see some deviation from expected behavior. When you run a query from the
BigQuery UI, the results are stored in your machine's local memory,
such as the browser cache. This means that the results are now outside
VPC Service Controls, so you can possibly save the results to a CSV file or to
Google Drive.
In this scenario, VPC Service Controls is working as intended since the result
is being exported from local machine which is outside the service perimeter, but
the overall restriction of BigQuery data is being circumvented.
To overcome this issue, restrict IAM permissions for users by
removing the bigquery.tables.export permission. Note that doing this disables
all the export options.
GKE Enterprise issues
This section lists the issues you might encounter while using
GKE Enterprise resources that are inside a VPC Service Controls
perimeter.
To troubleshoot errors related to the use of VPC Service Controls with
Cloud Service Mesh, see Troubleshoot VPC Service Controls issues for managed
Cloud Service Mesh .
GKE Enterprise Config Controller setup generates an egress violation
The process of setting up GKE Enterprise Config Controller is expected to
fail if there is no egress configuration that allows to reach
containerregistry.googleapis.com with the method
google.containers.registry.read in a project outside the perimeter.
To resolve this error, create the following egress rule:
From:
Identities: ANY_IDENTITY
To:
Projects =
NNNNNNNNNNNN
Service =
Service name: containerregistry . googleapis . com
Service methods:
containers . registry . read
The egress violation disappears after you have added the rule to the violated
perimeter.
Container Registry issues
This section lists the issues you might encounter while using Container Registry
resources that are inside a VPC Service Controls perimeter.
Container Registry API requests blocked by VPC Service Controls despite being allowed in an ingress or egress rule
If you have allowed access to Container Registry using ingress rules with the
identity_type field set to ANY_USER_ACCOUNT or ANY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT , access
is blocked by VPC Service Controls.
To resolve this issue, update the identity_type field to ANY_IDENTITY in the
ingress or egress rule.
Egress errors from a service agent while copying Artifact Registry-owned Docker image to a project in a perimeter
When you try to copy an Artifact Registry-owned image to your project that is
within a VPC Service Controls perimeter, you might encounter egress errors
in the logs from the service agent
cloud-cicd-artifact-registry-copier@system.gserviceaccount.com . This egress
error usually occurs when the perimeter policy is in the dry-run mode.
You can resolve this issue by creating an egress rule that allows the service
agent cloud-cicd-artifact-registry-copier@system.gserviceaccount.com access
to the storage.googleapis.com service in the project mentioned in the
VPC Service Controls error logs.
Vertex AI issues
This section lists the issues you might encounter while using Vertex AI
resources that are inside a VPC Service Controls perimeter.
User-managed notebooks API requests blocked by VPC Service Controls despite being allowed in an ingress or egress rule
If you have allowed access to User-managed notebooks API
using an ingress policy and you have set the identity_type
as ANY_USER_ACCOUNT or ANY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT , VPC Service Controls blocks
access to the API.
To resolve this issue, update the identity_type field to ANY_IDENTITY in the
ingress or egress rule.
Spanner issues
Spanner database backup is blocked by the NO_MATCHING_ACCESS_LEVEL
violation from the per-product, per-project service account (P4SA)
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcf-admin-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
To resolve this issue, add an ingress rule with the aforementioned service agent
or add it to an access level.
AlloyDB for PostgreSQL issues
If your AlloyDB for PostgreSQL cluster is protected by a CMEK, you might encounter
ingress errors in the logs from service agents
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com
and service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
To resolve this issue, add an ingress rule
with the aforementioned service agents access to the cloudkms.googleapis.com
service in the project mentioned in the VPC Service Controls error logs.
