Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Learn how to set up a service perimeter using VPC Service Controls. This
tutorial uses networking settings such as firewalls,
Private Service Connect, and DNS configurations that are necessary to
use a VPC Service Controls perimeter effectively. This tutorial then
demonstrates how services are allowed or denied, and how to make granular
exceptions for an allowlist of specific services.
Objectives
Configure a VPC Service Controls perimeter with additional
networking controls to mitigate exfiltration paths.
Allow or deny access to services inside the perimeter from requests that
originate from inside the perimeter or outside the perimeter.
Allow or deny
access to services outside the perimeter from requests that originate
within the perimeter.
Use the Restrict Resource Service Usage organization
policy and VPC Service Controls together.
Costs
This tutorial uses the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Compute Engine
Cloud Storage
Private Service Connect
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage, use the
pricing calculator .
When you finish this tutorial, you can avoid continued billing by deleting the
resources you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
This tutorial requires a project under your organization. If
you don't already have a Google Cloud organization, see
creating and managing an organization .
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

Set up your VPC Service Controls perimeter
To implement a VPC Service Controls perimeter for a VPC network, you must
implement networking controls that deny traffic to external services. The
following sections detail the networking configurations you must implement in
VPC networks inside your perimeter and an example perimeter configuration.
Prepare your VPC network
In this section, you set up private connectivity to Google APIs and services for your VPC network to mitigate a
range of network egress paths to the internet.
In Cloud Shell, set variables:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set compute/region REGION
gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID for the project where you will
create resources
REGION : a region that's close to your location—for example,
us-central1
ZONE : a zone that's close to your location—for example,
us-central1-a
Create a VPC network and a subnet with Private Google Access enabled:
gcloud compute networks create restricted-vpc --subnet-mode = custom
gcloud compute networks subnets create restricted-subnet \
--range = 10 .0.0.0/24 \
--network = restricted-vpc \
--enable-private-ip-google-access
Create a Private Service Connect endpoint and a
forwarding rule configured to use the
vpc-sc bundle :
gcloud compute addresses create restricted-psc-endpoint \
--global \
--purpose = PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT \
--addresses = 10 .0.1.1 \
--network = restricted-vpc
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create restrictedpsc \
--global \
--network = restricted-vpc \
--address = restricted-psc-endpoint \
--target-google-apis-bundle = vpc-sc
Configure the Cloud DNS server policy to redirect queries for Google
Cloud APIs to your Private Service Connect endpoint:
gcloud dns managed-zones create restricted-dns-zone \
--description = "Private DNS Zone to map Google API queries to the Private Service Connect endpoint for Google APIs" \
--dns-name = "googleapis.com." \
--networks = restricted-vpc \
--visibility = private
gcloud dns record-sets create googleapis.com \
--rrdatas = 10 .0.1.1 \
--type = A \
--ttl = 300 \
--zone = restricted-dns-zone
gcloud dns record-sets create *.googleapis.com \
--rrdatas = "googleapis.com." \
--type = CNAME \
--ttl = 300 \
--zone = restricted-dns-zone
Configure a firewall rule at a low priority to deny all egress traffic:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create deny-all-egress \
--priority = 65534 \
--direction = egress \
--network = restricted-vpc \
--action = DENY \
--rules = all \
--destination-ranges = 0 .0.0.0/0
Configure a firewall rule at a higher priority to allow traffic to
reach the IP address used by your Private Service Connect
endpoint:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-psc-for-google-apis \
--priority = 1000 \
--direction = egress \
--network = restricted-vpc \
--action = ALLOW \
--rules = tcp:443 \
--destination-ranges = 10 .0.1.1
These firewall rules deny egress broadly, before selectively allowing egress to
the Private Service Connect endpoint. This configuration denies
egress traffic to
the default domains
that are normally reachable by default with Private Google Access and
the
implied firewall rules .
Create a VPC Service Controls perimeter
In this section, you create a VPC Service Controls perimeter.
Note: This
tutorial implements an enforced perimeter because there are no production
resources inside the perimeter. If you're adding a perimeter to existing
production projects, we recommend testing with
dry run mode
before enforcing.
In Cloud Shell, create an access policy as a prerequisite to
create a VPC Service Controls perimeter:
gcloud access-context-manager policies create \
--organization = ORGANIZATION_ID --title "Access policy at organization node"
The output is similar to the following:
"Create request issued
Waiting for operation [operations/accessPolicies/123456789/create/123456789] to complete...done."
There can only be one access policy container at the organization node. If a
policy has already been created in your organization, the output is similar to the following:
"ALREADY_EXISTS: Policy already exists with parent ContainerKey{containerId=organizations/123456789012, numericId=123456789012}"
If you see this message, continue to the next step.
Create a VPC Service Controls perimeter that restricts the
Cloud Storage and Compute Engine services.
export POLICY_ID = $( gcloud access-context-manager policies list \
--organization = ORGANIZATION_ID \
--format = "value(name)" )
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters create demo_perimeter \
--title = "demo_perimeter" \
--resources = projects/ $( gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID --format = "value(projectNumber)" ) \
--restricted-services = "storage.googleapis.com,compute.googleapis.com" \
--enable-vpc-accessible-services \
--policy = $POLICY_ID \
--vpc-allowed-services = "RESTRICTED-SERVICES"
Caution: In this tutorial, you restrict only the Compute Engine and
Cloud Storage services. In a production perimeter, we recommend that
you restrict all supported services
to mitigate a range of exfiltration paths.
The sample perimeter configures --vpc-allowed-services flag with the
alias value RESTRICTED-SERVICES
to allow traffic from this VPC to the same set of services you define with the
--restricted-services flag.
Verify the services allowed from traffic outside your perimeter
The following sections demonstrate how the VPC Service Controls perimeter
allows or denies access to requests made from outside of the perimeter and how
you can selectively allow ingress to services by configuring access levels and
ingress policies.
To simulate traffic from outside your perimeter, you can run commands in
Cloud Shell. Cloud Shell is a resource outside your own
project and perimeter. The perimeter allows or denies requests even though the requests have sufficient Identity and Access Management privileges to succeed.
This tutorial uses the Compute Engine API, Cloud Storage API, and
Cloud Resource Manager API, but the same concepts apply to other services as well.
Verify that the perimeter denies external traffic to restricted services
In this section, you verify that the perimeter denies external traffic to
restricted services.
The previous diagram illustrates how an authorized client is denied access to
services inside the perimeter that you configured as restricted, but the client
is allowed access to services that you did not configure as restricted.
In the following steps, you verify this concept by using Cloud Shell to
attempt to create a VM inside your VPC network, which fails due
to the configuration of the VPC Service Controls perimeter.
In Cloud Shell, run the following command to create a VM
inside your VPC network.
gcloud compute instances create demo-vm \
--machine-type = e2-micro \
--subnet = restricted-subnet \
--scopes = https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \
--no-address
The output is similar to the following:
"ERROR: (gcloud.compute.instances.create) Could not fetch resource:
- Request is prohibited by organization's policy."
The request fails because Cloud Shell is outside of your perimeter,
and Compute Engine is configured with the --restricted-services
flag.
In Cloud Shell, run the following command to access the
Resource Manager service, which is not configured in the
--restricted-services flag.
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID
A successful response returns the details of your project. This response
demonstrates that your perimeter allows external traffic to the
Cloud Resource Manager API.
You have demonstrated that the perimeter denies external traffic
to services configured in --restricted-services and allows external
traffic to services not explicitly configured in --restricted-services .
The following sections introduce exception patterns to reach restricted
services inside the perimeter.
Verify that an access level allows an exception to the perimeter
In this section, you verify that an access level
allows an exception to the perimeter. An access level is useful when you want
to create an exception for external traffic to access all restricted services
inside the perimeter and you don't require granular exceptions for each service
or other attributes.
The previous diagram illustrates how an access level allows an authorized client
to access all the restricted services inside the perimeter.
In the following steps, you verify this concept by creating an access level and
then making a successful request to the Compute Engine service. This
request is allowed even you configured Compute Engine as restricted.
From Cloud Shell, create a YAML file that describes the
configuration of an access level and apply it to your perimeter. This
sample creates an access level for the user identity that you're currently
using to run the tutorial.
export USERNAME = $( gcloud config list account --format "value(core.account)" )
cat <<EOF > user_spec.yaml
- members:
- user: $USERNAME
EOF
gcloud access-context-manager levels create single_user_level \
--title = "single-user access level" \
--basic-level-spec = user_spec.yaml \
--policy = $POLICY_ID
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update demo_perimeter \
--add-access-levels = single_user_level \
--policy = $POLICY_ID
From Cloud Shell, run the following command again to attempt
to create a VM:
gcloud compute instances create demo-vm \
--machine-type = e2-micro \
--subnet = restricted-subnet \
--scopes = https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \
--no-address
This time, the request works. Your perimeter prevents external traffic from
using the restricted services, but the access level that you configured allows
an exception.
Note: After you update a service perimeter, it can take some time for the
changes to propagate and take effect. If you receive an unexpected result, wait
a minute and try again after the perimeter has fully updated.
Verify that an ingress policy allows a granular exception to the perimeter
In this section, you verify that an ingress policy allows a granular exception
to the perimeter. Compared to the coarse-grained access level, a fine-grained
ingress policy
can configure additional attributes about the traffic source and allow access to individual services or methods.
The previous diagram illustrates how an ingress policy allows an authorized
client to access only a specified service inside the perimeter, without allowing
access to other restricted services.
In the following steps, you verify this concept by replacing the access level
with an ingress policy that allows an authorized client to access only the
Compute Engine service, but does not allow access to other restricted
services.
From the Cloud Shell tab, run the following command to remove
the access level.
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update demo_perimeter \
--policy = $POLICY_ID \
--clear-access-levels
From the Cloud Shell tab, create an ingress policy that allows
your user identity to ingress to the
Compute Engine service only, and apply the policy to your perimeter.
cat <<EOF > ingress_spec.yaml
- ingressFrom:
identities:
- user: $USERNAME
sources:
- accessLevel: '*'
ingressTo:
operations:
- methodSelectors:
- method: '*'
serviceName: compute.googleapis.com
resources:
- '*'
EOF
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update demo_perimeter \
--set-ingress-policies = ingress_spec.yaml \
--policy = $POLICY_ID
From the Cloud Shell tab, run the following command to create a Cloud Storage bucket inside the perimeter.
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// PROJECT_ID -01
The output is similar to the following:
"ERROR: (gcloud.storage.buckets.create) HTTPError 403: Request is prohibited by organization's policy."
Cloud Shell is a client outside the perimeter, so the
VPC Service Controls perimeter blocks Cloud Shell from
communicating with restricted services inside the perimeter.
From the Cloud Shell tab, run the following command to make a
request to the Compute Engine service inside the perimeter.
gcloud compute instances describe demo-vm --zone = ZONE
A successful response returns the details of demo-vm . This response
demonstrates that your perimeter allows external traffic that meets the
conditions of your ingress policy to the Compute Engine service.
Verify the services allowed from traffic inside your perimeter
The following sections demonstrate how the VPC Service Controls perimeter
allows or denies requests to services from inside the perimeter, and how you can
selectively allow egress to external services by egress policies.
To demonstrate the difference between traffic inside and outside the perimeter,
the following sections use both Cloud Shell outside the perimeter and a
Compute Engine instance you create inside the perimeter. Commands that
you run from the SSH session on the Compute Engine instance inside the
perimeter use the identity of the attached service account, whereas commands run
from Cloud Shell outside the perimeter use your own identity. When
following the recommended setup for the tutorial, the perimeter allows or denies
requests even though the requests have sufficient IAM privileges to
succeed.
This tutorial uses the Compute Engine API, Cloud Storage API, and
Cloud Resource Manager API, but the same concepts apply to other services as well.
Verify that the perimeter allows internal traffic to restricted services inside the perimeter
In this section, you verify that the perimeter allows traffic from network
endpoints inside your perimeter if the service is also configured in VPC accessible services .
The previous diagram illustrates how a perimeter allows traffic from network
endpoints inside the perimeter to reach restricted services that you also
configured as VPC accessible services. Services that you did not configure as
VPC accessible services cannot be reached from network endpoints inside the
perimeter.
In the following steps, you verify this concept by establishing an SSH
connection to the Compute Engine instance inside the perimeter, then
making requests to services.
From Cloud Shell, create a firewall rule that allows SSH
traffic to your VPC network by allowing ingress from the 35.235.240.0/20 IP
address range that's used by the
IAP for TCP forwarding
service:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create demo-allow-ssh \
--direction = INGRESS \
--priority = 1000 \
--network = restricted-vpc \
--action = ALLOW \
--rules = tcp:22 \
--source-ranges = 35 .235.240.0/20
Start an SSH session to this instance:
gcloud compute ssh demo-vm --zone = ZONE
Verify that you have successfully connected to the demo-vm instance by
confirming that the command-line prompt has changed to show the hostname of your
instance:
username @demo - vm : ~ $
If the previous command fails, you might see an error message similar to the
following:
"[/usr/bin/ssh] exited with return code [255]"
In this case, the Compute Engine instance might not have completed
booting up. Wait a minute and then try again.
From the SSH session inside your perimeter, verify the services that
your perimeter allows internally by using a Google Cloud service that
is configured in the VPC accessible services allowlist. For example, try
any command using the Compute Engine service.
gcloud compute instances describe demo-vm --zone = ZONE
A successful response returns the details of demo-vm . This response
demonstrates that your perimeter allows internal traffic to the
Compute Engine API.
From the SSH session inside your perimeter, verify that the services
not included in the VPC accessible services allowlist are not allowed from
your VM. For example, the following command uses the
Resource Manager service, which is not configured in the VPC accessible
services allowlist.
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID
The output is similar to the following:
"ERROR: (gcloud.projects.list) PERMISSION_DENIED: Request is prohibited by organization's policy."
Your Compute Engine instance and other network endpoints can only
request services that are configured in the VPC accessible services allowlist.
However, serverless resources or service traffic originating from outside your
perimeter might request that service. If you want to prevent a service
from being used in your project, see the
Restricted Service Resource Usage policy .
Verify that the perimeter denies internal traffic to restricted services outside the perimeter
In this section, you verify that the perimeter blocks communication from
services inside the perimeter to Google Cloud services outside the
perimeter.
The previous diagram illustrates how internal traffic cannot communicate with
restricted services outside the perimeter.
In the following steps, you verify this concept by attempting to send internal
traffic to a restricted service inside the perimeter and to a restricted service
outside the perimeter.
From the SSH session inside your perimeter, run the following command
to create a storage bucket inside your perimeter. This command works
because the Cloud Storage service is configured in both restricted-services
and accessible-services .
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// PROJECT_ID -02
A successful response creates the storage bucket. This response
demonstrates that your perimeter allows internal traffic to the Cloud Storage
service.
From the SSH session inside your perimeter, run the following command
to read from a bucket that is outside of your perimeter. This
public bucket allows read-only permission to allUsers , but the perimeter
denies traffic from inside your perimeter to a restricted service outside
the perimeter.
gcloud storage cat gs://solutions-public-assets/vpcsc-tutorial/helloworld.txt
The output is similar to the following:
"ERROR: (gcloud.storage.objects.describe) HTTPError 403: Request is prohibited
by organization's policy."
This response demonstrates that you can use restricted services inside the
perimeter, but a resource inside the perimeter cannot communicate with
restricted services outside the perimeter.
Verify that an egress policy allows an exception to the perimeter
In this section, you verify that an egress policy allows an exception to the perimeter.
The previous diagram illustrates how internal traffic can communicate with a specific external resource when you grant a narrow exception with the egress policy.
In the following steps, you verify this concept by creating an egress policy
then accessing a public Cloud Storage bucket outside of the perimeter
allowed by the egress policy.
Open a new Cloud Shell session by clicking
add open a new tab in Cloud Shell.
In subsequent steps you switch between the first tab with the SSH session
inside your perimeter, and the second tab in Cloud Shell outside
your perimeter where the command-line prompt begins with
username@cloudshell .
From the Cloud Shell tab, create an egress policy that allows
egress from the attached service account identity of demo-vm using the
google.storage.objects.get method to a public bucket in an external
project. Update the perimeter with the egress policy.
export POLICY_ID = $( gcloud access-context-manager policies list \
--organization = ORGANIZATION_ID \
--format = "value(name)" )
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL = $( gcloud compute instances describe demo-vm \
--zone = ZONE \
--format = "value(serviceAccounts.email)" )
cat <<EOF > egress_spec.yaml
- egressFrom:
identities:
- serviceAccount: $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
egressTo:
operations:
- methodSelectors:
- method: 'google.storage.objects.get'
serviceName: storage.googleapis.com
resources:
- projects/950403849117
EOF
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update demo_perimeter \
--set-egress-policies = egress_spec.yaml \
--policy = $POLICY_ID
Return to the tab with the SSH session to the VM inside your perimeter,
where the command-line prompt begins with username@demo-vm .
From the SSH session inside your perimeter, make another request to the
Cloud Storage bucket and verify it works.
gcloud storage cat gs://solutions-public-assets/vpcsc-tutorial/helloworld.txt
The output is similar to the following:
"Hello world!
This is a sample file in Cloud Storage that is viewable to allUsers."
This response demonstrates that your perimeter and egress policy allow internal
traffic from a specific identity to a specific Cloud Storage bucket.
Note: After you update a service perimeter, it can take some time for the
changes to propagate and take effect. If you receive an unexpected result, wait
a minute and try again after the perimeter has fully updated.
From the SSH session inside your perimeter, you can also test other
methods that weren't explicitly allowed by the egress policy exception. For
example, the following command requires the google.storage.buckets.list
permission which is denied by your perimeter.
gcloud storage ls gs://solutions-public-assets/vpcsc-tutorial/*
The output is similar to the following:
"ERROR: (gcloud.storage.cp) Request is prohibited by organization's policy."
This response demonstrates that your perimeter denies internal traffic from
listing objects in the external bucket, indicating that the egress policy
narrowly allows explicitly specified methods.
For more references on common patterns for sharing data outside of your service
perimeter, see
secure data exchange with ingress and egress rules .
(Optional) Configure the Restricted Service Resource Usage policy
You might also have internal requirements or compliance requirements to
allow only individually approved APIs
to be used in your environment. In this case you might also configure the
Restricted Service Resource Usage
Organization Policy Service. By applying the Organization Policy in a project, you
restrict which services can be created in that project. However, the
Organization Policy does not prevent services in this project from
communicating with services in other projects. In comparison,
VPC Service Controls allows you to define a perimeter to prevent
communication with services outside the perimeter.
For example, if you define an Organization Policy to allow
Compute Engine and deny Cloud Storage in your project, a VM in this
project could not create a Cloud Storage bucket in your
project. However, the VM can make requests to a Cloud Storage bucket in
another project, so exfiltration with the Cloud Storage service is still
possible. The following steps show how to implement and test this scenario:
Switch to the Cloud Shell tab, where the command-line prompt
begins with username@cloudshell .
From the Cloud Shell tab, create a YAML file describing the
Organization Policy Service that will only allow usage of the Compute Engine
service and deny all other services, and then apply it to your project.
cat <<EOF > allowed_services_policy.yaml
constraint: constraints/gcp.restrictServiceUsage
listPolicy:
allowedValues:
- compute.googleapis.com
inheritFromParent: true
EOF
gcloud resource-manager org-policies set-policy allowed_services_policy.yaml \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Return to the tab with the SSH session to the VM inside your perimeter,
where the command-line prompt begins with username@demo-vm .
From the SSH session inside your perimeter, run the following command to
view the same storage bucket you previously created inside this project.
gcloud storage buckets describe gs:// PROJECT_ID
The output is similar to the following:
"ERROR: (gcloud.storage.buckets.create) HTTPError 403: Request is disallowed by organization's constraints/gcp.restrictServiceUsage constraint for 'projects/123456789' attempting to use service 'storage.googleapis.com'."
This response demonstrates that Organization Policy Service denies the Cloud Storage service
inside your project, regardless of the configuration of your perimeter.
Note: After you update an Organization Policy Service, it can take some time for the
changes to propagate and take effect. If you receive an unexpected result, wait
a minute and try again after the perimeter has fully updated.
From the SSH session inside your perimeter, run the following command
to view a storage bucket outside the perimeter that is allowed by your
egress policy.
gcloud storage cat gs://solutions-public-assets/vpcsc-tutorial/helloworld.txt
The output is similar to the following:
"Hello world!
This is a sample file in Cloud Storage that is viewable to allUsers."
A successful response returns the content of helloworld.txt in the external
storage bucket. This response demonstrates that your
perimeter and egress policy allows internal traffic to reach an external storage
bucket under certain limited conditions, but the Organization Policy Service denies the
Cloud Storage service in your project regardless of the configuration of your
perimeter. Services outside your project might still be used for exfiltration if
they are allowed by your perimeter, regardless of the Restricted Service
Resource Usage Organization Policy Service.
To deny communication with Cloud Storage or other Google services
outside the perimeter, the
Restricted Service Resource Usage
Organization Policy Service alone is not sufficient, you must configure a
VPC Service Controls perimeter. VPC Service Controls mitigates data
exfiltration paths, and
Restricted Service Resource Usage
is a compliance control to prevent creating unapproved services inside your
environment. Use these controls together to block a range of exfiltration paths
to and selectively allow approved services for internal use in your
environment.
Clean up
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Although the VPC Service Controls perimeter does not generate any
additional cost, it should be cleaned up to avoid clutter and unused resources
in your organization.
In the project selector at the top of the Google Cloud console, select the organization
you used during this tutorial.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC Service Controls
page.
Go to VPC Service Controls
Under the list of perimeters, select the perimeter you want to delete
and click Delete .
In the dialog, click Delete again to confirm deletion.
