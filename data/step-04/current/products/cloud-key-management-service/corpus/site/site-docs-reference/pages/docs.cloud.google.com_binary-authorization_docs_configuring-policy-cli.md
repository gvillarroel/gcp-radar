This page provides instructions for configuring a Binary Authorization
policy by using the Google Cloud CLI. As an alternative,
you can also perform these tasks by using the
Google Cloud console or the
REST API . This step is part of
setting up Binary Authorization .
To configure a policy using the command-line tool, you export the existing
policy as a YAML file. After you modify the file, you can import it to update
the policy, as described later in this guide. For more information on the policy
YAML format, see Policy YAML Reference .
Note: This page describes how to configure a policy for the container-based
platforms that Binary Authorization supports, including
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Distributed Cloud,
Cloud Run, and Cloud Service Mesh. Policy settings, such as rule type,
rule parameters, and parameter format can vary depending on the platforms you
use. Because of this, each section in this page notes the platforms the settings
apply to. Make sure the settings you use are supported for your platforms.
Before you begin
Enable Binary Authorization .
Create a cluster .
If you intend to use attestations , we recommend
that you create attestors before configuring the
policy. You can create attestors using a
command-line tool or through the
Google Cloud console .
Set the project ID to the project in which you enabled
Binary Authorization:
PROJECT_ID= PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
Export the policy YAML file
This section applies to GKE,
Distributed Cloud, Cloud Run, and
Cloud Service Mesh .
To update the policy, first export it to a local YAML file, as follows:
gcloud container binauthz policy export > /tmp/policy.yaml
By default, the file contents look similar to the following:
defaultAdmissionRule:
enforcementMode: ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG
evaluationMode: ALWAYS_ALLOW
globalPolicyEvaluationMode: ENABLE
name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /policy
To modify the policy, edit the file and add or update sections, as described
later in this guide. After you save the file, you can
import the policy .
To add an exempt image to the allowlist, add the
following to the policy file:
admissionWhitelistPatterns :
- namePattern : EXEMPT_IMAGE_PATH
Replace EXEMPT_IMAGE_PATH with the path to am image to exempt. To exempt additional images, add additional - namePattern entries. Learn more about admissionWhitelistPatterns .
Set the default rule
This section applies to GKE,
Distributed Cloud, Cloud Run, and
Cloud Service Mesh .
A rule is the part of a policy that defines constraints
that container images must satisfy before they can be deployed. The
default rule defines constraints that apply to
all non-exempt images that don't have their own
cluster-specific rule. Every policy must have a default rule.
The default rule is defined in the
defaultAdmissionRule node in
the policy YAML file. For more information on the parts of this rule, see
ADMISSION_RULE in the Policy YAML
Reference. For examples of default rules, see
Example Policies .
To set the default rule, edit the defaultAdmissionRule node in the
policy.yaml file as required:
defaultAdmissionRule:
evaluationMode: EVALUATION_MODE
enforcementMode: ENFORCEMENT_MODE
requireAttestationsBy:
- ATTESTOR
- ...
Replace the following:
EVALUATION_MODE : The
evaluation mode specifies
the type of constraint that the Binary Authorization enforcer enforces at deploy
time. Replace EVALUATION_MODE with one of the following
options:
ALWAYS_ALLOW : Allows all images to be deployed.
ALWAYS_DENY : Disallows all images from being deployed.
REQUIRE_ATTESTATION : Allows an image to be deployed if the image has
one or more attestations that can be verified by all of the attestors
that you add to this rule. At deploy time, the enforcer verifies the
attestation using the attestors you add to the ATTESTOR
list in this rule. To learn about creating attestors, see
Creating attestors . If you specify
REQUIRE_ATTESTATION , you must also add a requireAttestationsBy block
containing at least one attestor. To learn about creating attestors, see
Creating attestors .
ENFORCEMENT_MODE : The
enforcement mode specifies
how the enforcer responds when an image violates a rule.
Replace ENFORCEMENT_MODE with one of the following:
ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG : Block images that violate the rule
and log information about the violation to Cloud Audit Logs (default).
DRYRUN_AUDIT_LOG_ONLY : Allow all images to deploy but log enforcement
information, including information about violations, to Cloud Audit Logs.
ATTESTOR : If you set EVALUATION_MODE to
REQUIRE_ATTESTATION , you must also add a
requireAttesationsBy
block. In the block, you list one or more attestors, by resource ID. The
resource ID has the format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /attestors/ ATTESTOR_NAME .
To learn more about creating attestors, see
Creating attestors .
Note: We don't recommend using the ALWAYS_ALLOW evaluation mode in the default
rule. Doing so allows all images to deploy unless they fail to satisfy a
cluster-specific or other specific rule in the policy.
Manage exempt images
This section applies to GKE,
Distributed Cloud, Cloud Run, and
Cloud Service Mesh .
An exempt image is an image that is exempt from
policy rules. Binary Authorization always allows exempt images to be
deployed.
You specify exempt images by listing their registry paths in
admissionWhitelistPatterns . The path refers to
Container Registry or another image registry. At
deploy time, Binary Authorization exempts the list of images specified by
admissionWhitelistPatterns after the images specified by the
system policy .
To add an exempt image, add a namePattern node under an
admissionWhitelistPatterns
list in the policy.yaml file:
admissionWhitelistPatterns:
- namePattern: MATCHING_PATTERN
Replace MATCHING_PATTERN with the path to a single image in your
registry by exact match, or to any images matching a pattern using the wildcard
symbol ( * , ** ).
Cloud Run
This section applies to Cloud Run .
You cannot directly specify image names that contain a tag. For example, you cannot specify
IMAGE_PATH :latest.
If you want to specify image names that contain tags, you must specify the image name using a wildcard as follows:
* for all versions of a single image; for example, us-docker.pkg.dev/myproject/container/hello@*
** for all images in a project; for example, us-docker.pkg.dev/myproject/**
You can use path names to specify a digest in the format
IMAGE_PATH @ DIGEST .
System policy evaluation mode
This section applies to GKE and
Distributed Cloud .
System policy evaluation mode
is a policy setting that causes Binary Authorization to evaluate a system
policy before evaluating the policy that you configure. Google manages the
system policy, which exempts a list of Google-maintained system images that
GKE uses. Images listed in the system policy are not
blocked by policy enforcement. If you do not enable the setting, you must manage
the list of exempt images yourself. Learn how to
Manage exempt images .
You can view the contents of the system policy using the following command:
gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export-system-policy
To enable system policy evaluation mode, add the following line to
the policy.yaml file:
globalPolicyEvaluationMode: ENABLE
To disable system policy evaluation mode, add the following:
globalPolicyEvaluationMode: DISABLE
Note: For reliability reasons, the system policy is updated one region at a
time. As a result, the system policy can differ between regions
during an update.
You can export the system policy associated with a specific region as
follows:
gcloud alpha container binauthz policy export-system-policy \
--location = REGION > /tmp/policy.yaml
Replace REGION with the region associated with the system
policy that you want to export (or "global"). Examples include: asia-east1 ,
europe-west1 , us-central1 .
If you omit --location or specify --location=global , the command outputs a
system policy from a region in the last group of regions to receive
updates. Since most changes to the system policy are additions, the output
shows the set of system images that are currently allowed in all regions.
Set cluster-specific rules (optional)
This section applies to GKE and
Distributed Cloud .
A cluster can also have one or more
cluster-specific rules . This type of
rule applies to images that are to be deployed to specific
GKE clusters only. Cluster-specific rules are an optional
part of a policy.
Cluster-specific rules are defined in
clusterAdmissionRules nodes in
the policy YAML file. For more information on the parts of this rule, see
ADMISSION_RULE in the Policy YAML
Reference. For an example, see
Use a cluster-specific rule
in Example Policies .
To add a cluster-specific rule:
In the policy.yaml file, add a clusterAdmissionRules node:
clusterAdmissionRules:
CLUSTER_SPECIFIER :
evaluationMode: EVALUATION_MODE
enforcementMode: ENFORCEMENT_MODE
requireAttestationsBy:
- ATTESTOR
- ...
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_SPECIFIER : the resource ID of the cluster to which
the rule applies. You format the rule as follows:
For GKE, GKE attached clusters, and
GKE on AWS, the format is
CLUSTER_LOCATION.CLUSTER_NAME —for
example, us-central1-a.test-cluster .
For Google Distributed Cloud software (GKE clusters on bare metal
or VMware), the format is,
FLEET_MEMBERSHIP_LOCATION.FLEET_MEMBERSHIP_ID —for
example, global.test-membership .
Other properties are as described in Set the default rule
earlier in this guide. For an example of a cluster-specific rule, see
Example Policies .
EVALUATION_MODE : The
evaluation mode specifies
the type of constraint that the Binary Authorization enforcer enforces at deploy
time. Replace EVALUATION_MODE with one of the following
options:
ALWAYS_ALLOW : Allows all images to be deployed.
ALWAYS_DENY : Disallows all images from being deployed.
REQUIRE_ATTESTATION : Allows an image to be deployed if the image has
one or more attestations that can be verified by all of the attestors
that you add to this rule. At deploy time, the enforcer verifies the
attestation using the attestors you add to the ATTESTOR
list in this rule. To learn about creating attestors, see
Creating attestors . If you specify
REQUIRE_ATTESTATION , you must also add a requireAttestationsBy block
containing at least one attestor. To learn about creating attestors, see
Creating attestors .
ENFORCEMENT_MODE : The
enforcement mode specifies
how the enforcer responds when an image violates a rule.
Replace ENFORCEMENT_MODE with one of the following:
ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG : Block images that violate the rule
and log information about the violation to Cloud Audit Logs (default).
DRYRUN_AUDIT_LOG_ONLY : Allow all images to deploy but log enforcement
information, including information about violations, to Cloud Audit Logs.
ATTESTOR : If you set EVALUATION_MODE to
REQUIRE_ATTESTATION , you must also add a
requireAttesationsBy
block. In the block, you list one or more attestors, by resource ID. The
resource ID has the format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /attestors/ ATTESTOR_NAME .
To learn more about creating attestors, see
Creating attestors .
Set specific rules (optional)
You can create rules that are scoped to either a mesh service identity, a
Kubernetes service account, or a Kubernetes namespace.
Set a rule for a Cloud Service Mesh service identity
To set a rule for a Cloud Service Mesh service identity, edit your
policy.yaml file and add an istioServiceIdentityAdmissionRules block, for
example:
defaultAdmissionRule :
enforcementMode : ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG
evaluationMode : ALWAYS_DENY
globalPolicyEvaluationMode : ENABLE
istioServiceIdentityAdmissionRules :
SERVICE_IDENTITY_ID :
enforcementMode : ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG

requireAttestationsBy :
- < var>ATTESTOR</var>
- ...
name : projects/ PROJECT_ID /policy
Replace the following:
SERVICE_IDENTITY_ID : the Cloud Service Mesh service
identity to scope this rule to. The service identity has the following format:
PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog/ns/ NAMESPACE /sa/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT .
In the service identity ID, replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID in which you define your
Kubernetes resources.
NAMESPACE : the Kubernetes namespace.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT : the service account.
EVALUATION_MODE : The
evaluation mode specifies
the type of constraint that the Binary Authorization enforcer enforces at deploy
time. Replace EVALUATION_MODE with one of the following
