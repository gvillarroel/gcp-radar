This tutorial demonstrates how to use OpenSSF Scorecard to check container images for supply chain security best practices. The Scorecard Attestor runs as part of Cloud Build pipeline to generate an attestation that can be verified by Binary Authorization before deployment. This verification step prevents compromised container artifacts from being deployed to production, which can prevent several classes of supply chain vulnerabilities.
Overview
The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) is an organization that provides tools, services, and infrastructure for open source security initiatives.
Scorecard is a tool, maintained by the OpenSSF, that scans source code management (SCM) repositories for supply chain security best-practices.
Scorecard Attestor is a tool built into Scorecard that allows you to create Binary Authorization attestations based on a policy that you configure.
Scorecard Attestor runs Scorecard against the SCM repository of a container image, generates results, evaluates the results against the policy, and generates an attestation if the policy is satisfied.
In this tutorial, you build a sample repository and then use Scorecard Attestor. Each sample pipeline contains the following build steps:
build : Build a sample container image.
push : Push the image to Container Registry.
attest : Check and sign the image, using Scorecard Attestor to create an attestation based on the policy.
In the attest step of each pipeline, Scorecard Attestor does the following:
Fetches data about the SCM repository for the newly built container image.
Runs Scorecard on the raw data and evaluates the SCM repository against the user-specified policy.
If all policies are satisfied, Scorecard Attestor creates the attestation.
If any of the policies aren't satisfied, Scorecard Attestor doesn't create the attestation.
At deployment time, Binary Authorization checks for a verifiable attestation. Without one, the enforcer disallows the image from deploying.

Objectives
In this tutorial you do the following:
Set up Scorecard Attestor as a Cloud Build custom builder.
View and configure Scorecard Attestor policy.
Run Scorecard Attestor on a sample repository to create an attestation based on a policy.
Run Scorecard Attestor on a sample repository in verify-only mode without creating an attestation.
## Before you begin
In this section, you perform a one-time setup of the system.
Set up your environment
Store your Google Cloud project in an environment variable.
Note: This Google Cloud project is used throughout this tutorial.
export PROJECT_ID= PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project.
Set the default project ID to your Google Cloud project:
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
Store the project number in an environment variable for future steps:
export PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects list --filter = " ${ PROJECT_ID } " \
--format = "value(PROJECT_NUMBER)" )
Enable APIs:
To ensure the services required for this guide are enabled, execute the
following command:
gcloud services enable \
cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
containerregistry.googleapis.com \
containerscanning.googleapis.com \
cloudkms.googleapis.com
Set up IAM roles
Run the following commands to configure the Cloud Build service account
with the following roles:
containeranalysis.notes.editor : adds the
Artifact Analysis Notes Editor role to manage the
attestor.
containeranalysis.notes.occurrences.viewer : adds the
Artifact Analysis Occurrences for Notes role to manage both the
vulnerability and attestation occurrences.
roles/containeranalysis.occurrences.editor : adds the
Artifact Analysis
Occurrences Editor role to create attestation occurrences in
Artifact Analysis.
cloudkms.signer : adds the Cloud KMS CryptoKey Signer role that
allows the service account to access the Cloud KMS signing service.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount: $PROJECT_NUMBER @cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/containeranalysis.notes.editor
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount: $PROJECT_NUMBER @cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/containeranalysis.notes.occurrences.viewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount: $PROJECT_NUMBER @cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/containeranalysis.occurrences.editor
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount: $PROJECT_NUMBER @cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/cloudkms.signer
Create a Cloud KMS signing key
Cloud Key Management Service keys are used to create the attestation.
Create a new Cloud KMS key ring with the name
scorecard-attestor-key-ring :
gcloud kms keyrings create scorecard-attestor-key-ring \
--location global
Create a new Cloud KMS key called scorecard-attestor-key within
the key ring:
gcloud kms keys create scorecard-attestor-key \
--keyring scorecard-attestor-key-ring \
--location global \
--purpose "asymmetric-signing" \
--default-algorithm "rsa-sign-pkcs1-2048-sha256"
Store the digest algorithm and Cloud KMS in an environment variable for
future steps:
export KMS_DIGEST_ALG = SHA256
export KMS_KEY_NAME = projects/ $PROJECT_ID /locations/global/keyRings/ scorecard-attestor-key-ring /cryptoKeys/ scorecard-attestor-key /cryptoKeyVersions/1
Create the Binary Authorization attestor. Later, Scorecard Attestor creates a note associated with this attestor.
gcloud container binauthz attestors create scorecard-attestor \
--attestation-authority-note = scorecard-attestation \
--attestation-authority-note-project = $PROJECT_ID \
--description = "Attest that ossf/scorecard policy checks pass"
Associate the Binary Authorization attestor with the KMS key:
gcloud container binauthz attestors public-keys add \
--attestor = scorecard-attestor \
--keyversion = 1 \
--keyversion-key = scorecard-attestor-key \
--keyversion-keyring = scorecard-attestor-key-ring \
--keyversion-location = global \
--keyversion-project = $PROJECT_ID

Create attestations with Scorecard Attestor in a Cloud Build pipeline
Submit the failure-case sample build
In this section, you build a container image and check its supply chain security practices with OpenSSF Scorecard.
The image builds successfully, but does not create an attestation. The base repository contains some discouraged supply chain security practices, such as an unpinned dependency to Debian 10 in the Dockerfile, and a compiled binary artifact checked into the source repository.
These are violations of the attestation policy in the repository.
Clone the test repository: scorecard-binauthz-test-bad .
View the attestation policy file for the failure case.
cat policy-binauthz.yaml
(Optional) View the build configuration file for the failure case.
cat samples/signer/cloudbuild.yaml
Note: This build configuration file also contains user-defined substitutions .
Substitutions are variables, used within the build pipeline, that are passed
in through the gcloud builds submit command with the --substitutions
parameter.
Submit the build:
gcloud builds submit \
--substitutions = _KMS_KEY_NAME = $KMS_KEY_NAME ,_KMS_DIGEST_ALG = $KMS_DIGEST_ALG \
--config = cloudbuild.yaml
You should see output like the following:
time="2022-12-20T22:30:14Z" level=info msg="image failed scorecard attestation policy check"
Save the build ID from the last build:
export BUILD_ID=$(gcloud builds list --limit=1 --format="value('ID')")
Verify the result:
gcloud storage cat gs:// ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } .cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/log- ${ BUILD_ID } .txt | grep "failed scorecard attestation policy check"
Submit the success-case sample build
In this section you build a container image that satisfies its Scorecard attestation policy. In this case, the Scorecard Attestor creates an attestation.
To submit the success-case sample build to Cloud Build, do the following:
Clone the test repository: scorecard-binauthz-test-good .
View the attestation policy file for the failure case.
sh
cat policy-binauthz.yaml
(Optional) View the build configuration file for the failure case.
cat samples/signer/cloudbuild.yaml
Note: this build configuration file also contains user-defined substitutions .
Substitutions are variables, used within the build pipeline, that are passed
in through the gcloud builds submit command with the --substitutions
parameter.
Submit the build:
gcloud builds submit \
--substitutions = _KMS_KEY_NAME = $KMS_KEY_NAME ,_KMS_DIGEST_ALG = $KMS_DIGEST_ALG \
--config = cloudbuild.yaml
Verify the result:
gcloud storage cat gs:// ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } .cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/log- ${ BUILD_ID } .txt | grep "passed scorecard attestation policy check"
Get the URL of the container image that was built and checked by scorecard
export IMAGE_URI = $( gcloud storage cat gs:// ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } .cloudbuild-logs.googleusercontent.com/log- ${ BUILD_ID } .txt | grep -o "Attestation for image .* is successfully uploaded" txt | cut -d ' ' -f4 | tr -d '"' )
Confirm that an attestation was created for the container image. Scorecard Attestor uses the Note ID ossf-scorecard-attestation , and the note name projects/${PROJECT_ID}/notes/ossf-scorecard-attestation .
gcloud container binauthz attestations list \
--attestor = "projects/ ${ PROJECT_ID } /attestors/ossf-scorecard-attestor" \
--filter = "resourceUri='https:// ${ IMAGE_URI } '"
