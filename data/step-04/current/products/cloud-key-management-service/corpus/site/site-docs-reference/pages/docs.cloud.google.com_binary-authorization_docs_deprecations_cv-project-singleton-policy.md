Legacy continuous validation deprecation and shutdown
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The
Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service (section "Discontinuation of Services")
defines the deprecation policy that applies to Binary Authorization.
The deprecation policy only applies to the services,
features, or products listed therein.
After a service, feature, or product is officially
deprecated, it continues to be available for at least the period of time defined in the
Terms of Service. After this period of time, the service is scheduled for shutdown.
Binary Authorization is ending support for legacy continuous validation (legacy CV)
with project-singleton policies for GKE.
As of April 15, 2024, you can't enable legacy CV for
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on new projects.
Legacy CV will continue monitoring your
GKE Pods through project-singleton policies for existing
projects for which it is already enabled until May 1, 2025. After May 1, 2025,
legacy CV will no longer monitor your Pods, and
Cloud Logging entries will no longer be produced for Pod images that don't
conform to the project-singleton Binary Authorization policy.
Replacement: Continuous validation (CV) with check-based platform policies
Monitor your Pods using continuous validation (CV) with check-based platform policies .
In addition to support for attestations, check-based platform policies let you
monitor the metadata of container images associated with your Pods to help you
mitigate potential security issues. CV check-based policies
provide checks that include the following:
Vulnerability check : The
image is checked for security vulnerabilities that are at a level of severity
that you define.
Sigstore check : The image has
attestations that are signed by sigstore.
SLSA check : The image was built
from source in a trusted directory and by a trusted builder.
Trusted directory check :
The image must reside in a trusted directory within a trusted image
repository.
Like legacy continuous validation, CV with check-based policies also logs
Pods with non-conformant images to Logging.
If you use legacy continuous validation (legacy CV), see Migration .
For more information on how to use CV with check-based platform policies, see
Continuous validation overview .
Migration
To migrate from a legacy CV project-singleton policy to an
equivalent check-based platform policy, do the following:
For an ALWAYS_ALLOW project-singleton policy, create a check-based platform
policy without any checkSet block.
For an ALWAYS_DENY project-singleton policy, create a check-based platform
policy with a single checkSet block that has an alwaysDeny check.
For a project-singleton policy that requires attestations, create a
single check-based policy, and for each attestor in the project-singleton
policy, add one SimpleSigningAttestationCheck
to the check-based policy. By using the same key pair, the check continues to
work with your existing attestations, and logs only Pod images that don't have
valid attestations.
Check-based platform policies are scoped to a GKE cluster, rather
than a Google Cloud project. After you create a check-based platform
policy, you can apply that policy to one or more clusters.
To enable CV with check-based platform policies on a cluster,
the cluster's Binary Authorization settings must be configured
during the cluster creation or update process.
