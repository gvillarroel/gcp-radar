This page shows you how to use the Binary Authorization
continuous validation (CV) image freshness check
to check the freshness of the images associated with Pods running on
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters where CV is enabled. To do
this, CV checks when the image was uploaded to the image
registry.
This check supports only Artifact Registry and Container Registry repositories.
Costs
This guide uses the following Google Cloud services:
Binary Authorization, but CV is available free of charge during the Preview stage

Required roles
This section shows you how to set roles for this check.
Overview
If you run all of the products that are mentioned in this guide in the same
project, you don't need to set any permissions. Binary Authorization
configures the roles correctly when you enable it. If you run the products in
different projects, you must set roles as described in this section.
To ensure that the policy project's Binary Authorization Service Agent has the necessary
permissions to evaluate the CV image freshness check,
ask your administrator to grant the
following IAM roles to the policy project's Binary Authorization Service Agent:
Important: You must grant these roles
to the policy project's Binary Authorization Service Agent, not to your user account. Failure to grant the roles to the correct principal might result in permission errors.
If your cluster project is different than the policy project:
Binary Authorization Policy Evaluator ( roles/binaryauthorization.policyEvaluator )
on the cluster project Binary Authorization Service Agent, for it to access the policy project
If your Artifact Registry project—the project that stores your images—is different from your policy project:
Artifact Registry Reader ( roles/artifactregistry.reader )
on the policy project Binary Authorization Service Agent, for it to access the attestation project
If your Artifact Registry project is different from your cluster project:
Artifact Registry Reader ( roles/artifactregistry.reader )
on the cluster project Binary Authorization Service Agent, for it to access image metadata in the Artifact Registry project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Your administrator might also be able to give the policy project's Binary Authorization Service Agent
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Grant roles using the gcloud CLI
To ensure that the Binary Authorization Service Agent in each project has the
necessary permissions to evaluate this check, grant the Binary Authorization
Service Agent in each project the following IAM roles.
Cluster project different than the policy project
Grant the Binary Authorization service agent in the cluster project the
Binary Authorization Policy Evaluator
( roles/binaryauthorization.policyEvaluator )
role on the policy project.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding POLICY_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- $( gcloud projects describe CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID --format = 'value(projectNumber)' ) @gcp-sa-binaryauthorization.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = roles/binaryauthorization.policyEvaluator
Replace the following:
POLICY_PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that contains your policy.
CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the cluster.
Policy project different than the artifact project
Grant the Binary Authorization service agent in the policy project the
Artifact Registry Reader
( roles/artifactregistry.reader ) role on the artifact project.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ARTIFACT_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- $( gcloud projects describe POLICY_PROJECT_ID --format = 'value(projectNumber)' ) @gcp-sa-binaryauthorization.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = roles/artifactregistry.reader
Replace ARTIFACT_PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project that contains
your Artifact Registry repository.
Note: If you use Container Registry, migrate to Artifact Registry. Container Registry is deprecated . For migration instructions, see
Transition from Container Registry .
Cluster project different than the artifact project
Grant the Binary Authorization service agent in the cluster project the
Artifact Registry Reader
( roles/artifactregistry.reader ) role on the artifact project.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ARTIFACT_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- $( gcloud projects describe CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID --format = 'value(projectNumber)' ) @gcp-sa-binaryauthorization.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = roles/artifactregistry.reader
Replace the following:
ARTIFACT_PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that contains
your Artifact Registry repository.
Note: If you use Container Registry, you can
use the Storage Object Viewer
( roles/storage.objectViewer ) role, but we recommend that
you migrate to Artifact Registry. Container Registry is deprecated. For
migration instructions, see Transition from Container Registry .
CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID : the project ID that runs your GKE
clusters.
Create a platform policy
To create a CV platform policy with the image freshness check ,
do the following:
Create the platform policy YAML file:
cat << EOF > /tmp/my-policy.yaml
gkePolicy:
checkSets:
- checks:
- imageFreshnessCheck:
maxUploadAgeDays: MAX_UPLOAD_AGE_DAYS
displayName: CHECK_DISPLAY_NAME
displayName: CHECK_SET_DISPLAY_NAME
EOF
Replace the following:
MAX_UPLOAD_AGE_DAYS : the maximum elapsed time
since the image was uploaded to the registry, in days.
CHECK_SET_DISPLAY_NAME : an optional display name
of your choice for the check set
CHECK_DISPLAY_NAME : an optional display name of
your choice for the check
Create the platform policy:
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:

View logs for CV entries
You can search Cloud Logging entries to find CV configuration errors
and CV platform policy validation violations .
CV logs errors and violations to Cloud Logging
within 24 hours. You can usually see entries within a few hours.
View CV configuration error logs
To view CV configuration error logs, run the following command:
gcloud logging read \
--order = "desc" \
--freshness = 7d \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID \
'logName:"binaryauthorization.googleapis.com%2Fcontinuous_validation" "configErrorEvent"'
The following output shows a configuration error in which a CV

Clean up
This section describes how to clean up the CV monitoring you
configured earlier in this guide.
You can disable CV monitoring or both Binary Authorization
and CV in your cluster.
Disable Binary Authorization in a cluster
To disable both CV and Binary Authorization enforcement in your
cluster, run the following command:
gcloud beta container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--binauthz-evaluation-mode = DISABLED \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster
LOCATION : the cluster location
CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID : the cluster project ID
Disable check-based policy monitoring in a cluster
To disable CV with check-based policies in the cluster, and
re-enable enforcement using the Binary Authorization enforcement policy, run
the following command:
gcloud beta container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--binauthz-evaluation-mode = PROJECT_SINGLETON_POLICY_ENFORCE \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = " CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID "
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster
LOCATION : the cluster location
CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID : the cluster project ID
Note that --binauthz-evaluation-mode=PROJECT_SINGLETON_POLICY_ENFORCE is
equivalent to the older flag --enable-binauthz .
Delete the policy
To delete the policy, run the following command. It is not necessary to delete
the check-based platform policy to disable check-based policy auditing.
gcloud beta container binauthz policy delete POLICY_ID \
--platform = gke \
--project = " POLICY_PROJECT_ID "
Replace the following:
POLICY_ID : the ID of the policy
POLICY_PROJECT_ID : the policy project ID
What's next
Use the image freshness check
Use the simple signing attestation check
Use the Sigstore signature check
Use the SLSA check
Use the trusted directory check
Use the vulnerability check
