Continuous validation (CV) with check-based platform policies is a feature of Binary Authorization
that lets you monitor Pods that run on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to ensure that
their associated container images continue to conform to
Binary Authorization check-based platform policies that
you specify.
When CV determines that Pods violate platform policies, it
logs the violations to Cloud Logging.
CV with platform policies supersedes legacy continuous validation ( deprecated ).
Why use CV?
Although Binary Authorization enforcement provides one-time image validations
when you deploy container images, CV continuously monitors that
images associated with running Pods continue to conform to your policies.
Because of this, when you enable both Binary Authorization enforcement and
CV with check-based policies, you can ensure that policy
conformance is validated throughout the entire orchestration lifecycle.
CV is useful in the following scenarios:
Policy changes : When you update your Binary Authorization
project-singleton enforcement policies ,
Binary Authorization validates only images that are deployed after the
update. Pods that are already running aren't affected. They continue to run
even if Binary Authorization, using the updated policy, would now block the
same image from being deployed.
Because of this, when you update the Binary Authorization project-singleton
policy, we recommend that you also create or update a CV
platform policy to match the project-singleton policy. That way
CV informs you of running Pods that violate your updated
policies.
Monitoring image metadata : CV provides specific checks
for changes in image metadata, including the following:
Attestations : CV logs when the
attestations on the Pods' images are no longer valid.
Freshness : CV logs when it detects
that Pods' images are no longer fresh.
Provenance : CV can check that Pods' images
were built with a trusted builder, using build configs that reside in a
trusted source repository.
Sigstore signatures : CV logs when the
on the Pods' images lack a valid Sigstore signature.
Trusted directory : CV logs when
the Pods' images reside in a repository directory that isn't listed in your
platform policy.
Vulnerabilities : CV logs when
vulnerabilities are identified in Pods' images.
Dry run monitoring : When you enable dry run, Binary Authorization
allows all images to be deployed. By enabling CV with a
platform policy that matches your project-singleton policy, CV
regularly logs images that violate the platform policy.
Breakglass monitoring : When you deploy Pods using breakglass ,
Binary Authorization bypasses project-singleton policy enforcement and logs
a single event to Cloud Audit Logs. By using a matching platform policy, however,
CV continues to regularly log policy-violating Pods, including
those Pods deployed using breakglass.
How CV works
To use CV, you must enable it on your
GKE clusters.
After you deploy images on your cluster, CV monitors the
associated Pods to make sure they conform with your check-based platform
policy.
CV doesn't support image tags, other than those specified in
exempt images .
CV regularly reviews running Pods
To monitor running Pods, CV reviews images associated with each
Pod at least every 24 hours. CV also monitors init containers and
ephemeral containers.
During each review, CV retrieves a list of images associated with
each Pod. CV then verifies that image information satisfies the
platform policy.
CV logs violations of platform policies
When CV determines that images violate a platform policy,
it logs the violations and other findings to Cloud Logging . A
separate log entry is written for each platform policy that is violated, for
each Pod.
When CV evaluates a Pod's images using a platform policy, the
images might satisfy some checks and violate others. CV produces
a log entry whenever any image of a Pod violates any check. The log
entry contains only the Pod images that violate the platform policy. If all images
satisfy all checks, no log entries are produced.
CV continues to log policy violations until a Pod with
non-policy-conformant images terminates. When non-policy-conformant Pods are
terminated during the interval between validations, the final
CV-generated log entries can appear after termination, during the
next CV evaluation .
Non-policy-conformant Pods should be logged at least once, even for short-lived
Pods.
CV does not terminate running Pods.
CV uses a feed resource
To retrieve information about Pods running on your GKE cluster,
CV creates a feed resource called binauthz-cv-cai-feed .
Important: Deleting or modifying the binauthz-cv-cai-feed feed can cause
CV to fail. CV automatically restores missing or
altered feeds, but it can fail to log findings until it does so.
CV platform policies
To use CV, you first configure platform policies.
Platform policies are different from legacy Binary Authorization policies,
also called project-singleton policies .
Although the deployment project can have only one legacy project-singleton
policy, you can configure multiple platform policies .
Each platform policy can reside in one or more projects.
Platform policies work only with CV and don't support
Binary Authorization enforcement. Because of this, we recommend that if you
want to use both Binary Authorization enforcement and CV
monitoring, you create a project-singleton policy for enforcement and a platform
policy for monitoring.
For example, suppose that you want to configure Binary Authorization to
enforce that your images have an attestation before they are allowed to be
deployed, and you also want to ensure that your running Pods conform to the same
requirement. To do this, you configure a project-singleton enforcement policy
with an attestor . You then create a
platform policy with a simple signing attestation check .
that has an authenticator based on the same note and public key as the attestor.
Platform policies are platform specific. GKE is the only
supported platform.
You can configure checks in platform policies. Checks are grouped
into one or more check sets . Each check set can specify
one or more checks .
Platform policies can exempt images from
evaluation by CV.
Required permissions
To list or describe platform policies, you need the
binaryauthorization.policyViewer role. To create, modify, and delete platform
policies, you need the binaryauthorization.policyEditor role.
For more information, see Manage platform policies .
Policy updates
Updating a platform policy
overwrites the existing policy with a policy descriptor that you provide in
the YAML file. To add a new check to an existing platform policy, we recommend
that you describe
the existing policy, saving it to a YAML file, add the new check, and then
update the policy using the updated file.
Multiple platform policies
You can create platform policies in the same project as the cluster (a local
platform policy) or in any other project.
Because you can configure a number of platform policies, you name each one with
a unique resource name. When you run a gcloud CLI command you refer to
the local platform policy using its ID. When you refer to a platform policy in
another project, you use the resource name, in the following format:
projects/ POLICY_PROJECT_ID /platforms/gke/policies/ POLICY_ID
You can choose which platform policy to associate with each GKE
cluster, whether it's a local platform policy or one in a different project.
Multiple checks per platform policy
You can configure multiple checks in each platform policy by adding them to the
checks block of the policy. To learn more about specific checks that you
can configure, see checks .
When your CV platform policy specifies more than one check,
images that are evaluated by one check continue to be evaluated by the other
checks.
Binary Authorization evaluates all of the checks that are configured in the
platform policy for each image unless the image matches an exempt images
allowlist pattern. For more information, see Exempt images .
Single-project setup
You can set up CV in a single project.
In a single-project setup, Binary Authorization automatically sets up its
required roles in the Binary Authorization service agent.
If GKE clusters, platform policies bound to the clusters, and the
metadata that is required by checks all reside in the same project,
no additional Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles are required.
To learn more about configuring a multi-project setup for added security, see
Separation of concerns .
Multi-project setup
When you configure a multi-project CV setup with platform
policies, the platform policies, the images, the GKE cluster, and
other types of CV-dependent resources can each reside in a
different project.
In multi-project setup, it's important to know the purpose of each project and
the resources that CV needs to access and set up required
IAM roles and permissions accordingly.
How to use CV
To use CV, you typically do the following:
Decide which checks you want to use.
Compose one or more platform policies using a policy YAML file. The file
specifies which checks you want to use.
Create the platform policy .
The policy can be stored in a project of your choice.
Choose whether to enable CV on
individual clusters
or on a fleet .
Check CV logs in Logging for events.
Review logs and update your build and other processes to produce images that
satisfy the checks.
Important: When you update existing clusters to enable CV, they
might already be using Binary Authorization for enforcement. In this case, use
the following flag to ensure continued enforcement:
--binauthz-evaluation-mode=POLICY_BINDINGS_AND_PROJECT_SINGLETON_POLICY_ENFORCE
Checks
This section describes the specific checks that CV provides.
Check-based policies have the following canonical format:
gkePolicy:
checkSets:
- checks:
- CHECK_TYPE1 :
CHECK_TYPE1_PARAMETERS
displayName: CHECK_TYPE1_DISPLAY_NAME
- CHECK_TYPE2 :
CHECK_TYPE2_PARAMETERS
displayName: CHECK_TYPE2_DISPLAY_NAME
displayName: CHECK_SET_DISPLAY_NAME
The displayName field in checks and checkSets is optional. It is used only
when CV logs policy violations. It is omitted in some of the
examples later in this guide.
Always-deny check
The always-deny check guarantees that all images subject to this check fail
evaluation. Each time CV reviews running Pods with this check, it
produces a log entry for each of the Pods.
You can combine the always-deny check with allowlists or multiple check sets to
ensure that Binary Authorization always produces logs for Pods in certain
cases.
To use the always-deny check, add alwaysDeny: true in the checks block, as
follows:
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
- displayName : "My check set"
checks :
- alwaysDeny : true
The value of alwaysDeny can't be set to false . Instead, remove the check.
For examples of how the always-deny check can be used, see Use multiple check sets .
Image freshness check
The image freshness check computes the duration that an image has been running
and logs when the duration has exceeded the threshold, maxUploadAgeDays .
In the following example platform policy YAML, CV logs Pods with
images that were uploaded to the repository from which they were deployed more
than 30 days ago.
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
checks :
- imageFreshnessCheck :
maxUploadAgeDays : 30
displayName : "My image freshness check"
displayName : "My check set"
Simple signing attestation check
You can use the CV simple signing attestation check to check
that each of a Pod's images have a valid, signed attestation.
This check is equivalent to the attestation evaluation in a
Binary Authorization enforcement policy. You can configure this check with the
same notes and keys that you used in your attestor. We recommend that you use
this check instead of legacy continuous validation ( deprecated ).
The following is an example of a platform policy with a simple signing
attestation check:
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
checks :
simpleSigningAttestationCheck :
containerAnalysisAttestationProjects :
- "projects/my-attestation-project1"
- "projects/my-attestation-project2"
attestationAuthenticators :
pkixPublicKeySet :
pkixPublicKeys :
publicKeyPem : |
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQxXxgAEvgQuW1FHYZPB2PTQfOJKUkS9sjMO/1os10xOWrhl1kQo4EnzMOovROWVLo+m9mcwp7nRQ2qQDThZdSFi0nFJ1A==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
signatureAlgorithm : ECDSA_P256_SHA256
Instead of Binary Authorization attestors ,
CV attestation checks have authenticators . You specify
authenticators directly in the policy, in the attestationAuthenticators block.
In a platform policy, simpleSigningAttestationCheck can have multiple
attestationAuthenticators and multiple keys in each pkixPublicKeySet . The
check is satisfied when each of the Pods' images have a valid attestation signed
with any key in any authenticator's pkixPublicKeySet .
Important: Although Binary Authorization project-singleton policies require a
valid attestation from any key of every attestor, the simple signing attestation
check requires an attestation from any key in any authenticator. To configure
the equivalent of a project-singleton policy with multiple attestors, you must
configure multiple attestation checks in your platform policy. It is not
sufficient to configure multiple authenticators or multiple keys.
CV platform policies are different from project-singleton
enforcement policies in the following ways:
PGP keys are not supported.
Attestors are not needed. Instead, you manually create keys and then
describe
a platform policy to retrieve the key ID that you then use to create the
attestation.
You manually create and sign the payload, create the attestation JSON file,
and create the attestation using the Artifact Analysis API.
You still create an Artifact Analysis Note, but you don't
specify it in the policy. Instead CV looks for
attestations in every project that is listed in the
containerAnalysisAttestationProjects field.
Attestations are still stored in Artifact Analysis occurrences,
but they can be stored in more than one project.
You must explicitly specify one or more projects that contain attestations
by using the resource name projects/ ATTESTATION_PROJECT_ID .
CV doesn't support image tags, except those specified in exempt
images.
If images are deployed with an image tag instead of a digest, CV
first evaluates it against exempt images ,
since allowlists can include tags. If the image isn't exempted, then
CV attempts to find the image digest. Because there isn't one,
the image violates the check.
SLSA check
The SLSA check checks the SLSA-specified provenance
of Pods' images.
The following is an example of a CV platform policy YAML
configuration:
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
checks :
imageAllowlist :
allowPattern : "gcr.io/my-images/not-built-by-GCB/**"
- slsaCheck :
rules :
trustedBuilder : GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUILD
attestationSource :
- containerAnalysisAttestationProjects : "projects/attestation-project1"
- containerAnalysisAttestationProjects : "projects/attestation-project2"
# Require that images were built using a checked-in top-level config file.
configBasedBuildRequired : true
# Which repos the config file can be from.
trustedSourceRepoPatterns :
- "source.cloud.google.com/my-project/my-source-repo"
- "github.com/my-github-user/*"
displayName : "My SLSA check"
displayName : "My check set"
When CV reviews images using this platform policy, it checks the
following:
The images must have been built by a trusted builder.
Cloud Build is the only trusted builder that the SLSA check supports.
Cloud Build must have generated the attestations in either
attestation-project1 or attestation-project2 .
The images must be built using a top-level config file from either of the
following trusted repositories:
The repository source.cloud.google.com/my-project/my-source-repo/
Any repositories in github.com/my-github-user/
The images in gcr.io/my-images/not-built-by-GCB/ or its subdirectories (that
were not built by Cloud Build) are exempted from the check as they
would violate it.
Sigstore signature check
The Sigstore signature check verifies that images have been signed using Sigstore
signatures.
This check supports only images hosted in Artifact Registry. It checks if any
signature fetched from Artifact Registry can be successfully verified by any key
in the policy.
The following example platform policy describes how to configure a Sigstore
signature check:
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
- checks :
- displayName : sigstore-signature-check
sigstoreSignatureCheck :
sigstoreAuthorities :
- displayName : sigstore-authority
publicKeySet :
publicKeys :
publicKeyPem : |
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQxXxgAEvgQuW1FHYZPB2PTQfOJKUkS9sjMO/1os10xOWrhl1kQo4EnzMOovROWVLo+m9mcwp7nRQ2qQDThZdSFi0nFJ1A==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
In the platform policy, sigstoreSignatureCheck can have multiple
sigstoreAuthorities and multiple keys in each publicKeySet . The check is
satisfied when each of the Pods' images have a valid attestation signed with
any key in any authenticator's publicKeySet .
Important: Although Binary Authorization project-singleton policies require a
valid attestation from any key of every attestor, the Sigstore signature check
requires an attestation from any key in any authority. To configure the
equivalent of a project-singleton policy with multiple authorities, you must
configure multiple Sigstore signature checks in your platform policy. It is not
sufficient to configure multiple authenticators or multiple keys.
Trusted directory check
The trusted directory check checks that Pods' images reside in one of the
provided trusted directories that you specify in a platform policy.
When you use this check, we recommend that you also safeguard the repositories
that you list as trusted directories in your policy against unauthorized access.
The following example platform policy describes how to configure a trusted
directory check:
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
checks :
trustedDirectoryCheck :
trustedDirPatterns :
- "gcr.io/my-project/gcr-directory"
- "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/ar-directory"
displayName : "My trusted directory check"
displayName : "My check set"
In the example platform policy, trustedDirPatterns lists the trusted
directories. If all of the Pods' images reside in the listed directories,
they conform to the policy. Pods' images that don't reside in the listed
directories violate the policy, and CV logs the violations.
Vulnerability check
The vulnerability check uses Artifact Analysis vulnerability
scanning to check whether Pods's images contain vulnerabilities. This includes
new vulnerabilities that are identified by vulnerability scanning since the Pod
was deployed. In the vulnerability check, you can configure vulnerability
severity level thresholds and specific
vulnerabilities (as CVEs). Images with vulnerabilities that violate the
vulnerability check are logged to Logging.
To use this check, you must first enable vulnerability scanning in
Artifact Analysis.
The following example platform policy configuration contains a vulnerability
check:
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
- displayName : "Default check set"
checks :
- vulnerabilityCheck :
maximumFixableSeverity : MEDIUM
maximumUnfixableSeverity : HIGH
allowedCves :
- "CVE-2022-11111"
- "CVE-2022-22222"
blockedCves :
- "CVE-2022-33333"
- "CVE-2022-44444"
containerAnalysisVulnerabilityProjects : "projects/my-project"
In the example, maximumUnfixableSeverity and maximumFixableSeverity define
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity levels that are associated
with any vulnerability that Artifact Analysis can identify.
Additionally, blockedCves lists specific Common Vulnerability Exposures
(CVEs). If an identified vulnerability exceeds one of the specified severity
levels or matches one of the CVEs listed in blockedCves , and it doesn't match
one of the CVEs listed in allowedCves , then CV logs an entry to
Logging.
Validate updated policies
After you update a CV platform policy, we strongly recommend
that you validate that Binary Authorization and CV
continue to operate as you expect.
Validate your configuration
To check your configuration, inspect both your Binary Authorization project-singleton policies
and CV platform policies .
Validate operation
To validate that Binary Authorization and CV are operating as
you expect, you can deploy test Pods and then check Binary Authorization
entries in Logging.
Exempt images with allowlists
When you create a platform policy, you can exempt images from checks by adding
their URLs to an allowlist. An allowlist at the policy level exempts images from
the entire policy. An allowlist at the check set level exempts from the check
set, and it applies only when that check set is evaluated. An allowlist within a
check exempts images only from that check.
Allowlist patterns are patterns that match one or more image URLs. An allowlist
pattern can be one of the following:
An image name prefix, ending with the wildcard * or ** .
Just an image name, with no tag or digest.
An image name with a tag (or tag prefix with the wildcard * ).
An image name with a digest.
An image name with both a tag and a digest.
The following are examples of allowlist patterns:
us-central1.pkg.dev/my-project/my-image:latest@sha256:77b0b75136b9bd0fd36fb50f4c92ae0dbdbbe164ab67885e736fa4374e0cbb8c
matches an exact image name, tag, and digest.
us-central1.pkg.dev/my-project/my-image:latest matches the name and tag, with
any digest (or no digest).
us-central1.pkg.dev/my-image:foo* matches the name and tag prefix (such as
myimage:foo and myimage:foobar ), with any digest (or no digest).
us-central1.pkg.dev/my-project/my-image@sha256:77b0b75136b9bd0fd36fb50f4c92ae0dbdbbe164ab67885e736fa4374e0cbb8c
matches the name and digest, with any tag (or no tag).
us-central1.pkg.dev/my-project/my-image matches the name, with any tag
and/or digest.
The wildcard characters * and ** can be used to match any name with a
certain prefix. * matches suffixes that don't include / . ** matches
suffixes that can include / , but ** can only be used after a / . Note that
* and ** cannot be used with tags or digests.
For example:
us-central1.pkg.dev/my-project/my-image* matches
us-central1.pkg.dev/myproject/my-image ,
us-central1.pkg.dev/myproject/my-image1 , and
us-central1.pkg.dev/myproject/my-image2 , with any tag and/or digest.
us-central1.pkg.dev/my-project/** matches
us-central1.pkg.dev/myproject/my-image and
us-central1.pkg.dev/my-project/some-directory/other-image , with any tag
and/or digest.
Note that name prefixes and tag prefixes must not be empty. So * or ** alone
is not a valid pattern, and neither is us-central1.pkg.dev/my-image:* .
gkePolicy-level exemption
The following example shows you how to exempt images at a platform policy
level. All of the images in the exempt-images1 and exempt-images2
directories and their subdirectories are excluded from CV
monitoring.
gkePolicy :
imageAllowlist :
- allowPattern : "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /exempt-images1/**"
- allowPattern : "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /exempt-images2/**"
checkSets :
checks :
...
In the policy, images listed under imageAllowlist are exempted from all of
the check sets ( checkSets ) that are listed under gkePolicy .
checkSet-level exemption
The following example shows you how to exempt images at the check set level:
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
imageAllowlist :
- allowPattern : "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /exempt-images1/**"
- allowPattern : "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /exempt-images2/**"
checks :
...
In the policy, images listed under imageAllowlist are exempted from all of
the checks that are listed under checkSets .
checks-level exemption
The following example shows you how to exempt images at the check level:
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
checks :
imageAllowlist :
- allowPattern : "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /exempt-images1/**"
- allowPattern : "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /exempt-images2/**"
...
Use multiple check sets
A CV check-based policy can contain more than one check set.
CV evaluates one check set each time it evaluates the policy. You
can think of check sets as sub-policies that should be evaluated in different
situations. For example, if you want to apply different checks in development
environments than you do in production environments, you can put the checks for
each environment in a separate check set, one that gets evaluated only in the
development environment, and one that gets evaluated in production.
Each check set is scoped to either a Kubernetes namespace or a Kubernetes
service account. The scope determines which Pods the check set applies to.
When a check set is configured with a scope, it applies only to Pods running in
that scope.
When a check set has no scope, it's called a default check set , which means
that the checks apply to all Pods, regardless of their Kubernetes namespace or
service account scope.
Most of the example policies in the CV guides use only a default
check set.
The following example policy configuration configures three check sets:
gkePolicy :
checkSets :
- displayName : "Prod check set"
scope :
kubernetesNamespace : "prod-namespace"
checks :
- trustedDirectoryCheck :
trustedDirPatterns : "gcr.io/my-project/prod-images"
- imageFreshnessCheck :
maxUploadAgeDays : 30
- displayName : "Dev check set"
scope :
kubernetesNamespace : "dev-namespace"
checks :
- trustedDirectoryCheck :
trustedDirPatterns : "gcr.io/my-project/dev-images"
- displayName : "Default check set"
checks :
- alwaysDeny : true
In the example configuration, the first check set is scoped to prod-namespace ,
so its checks affect only Pods running in that scope. The second check set is
scoped to dev-namespace , so its checks affect only Pods running in that scope.
The third check set is a default check set. Its checks apply to all Pods in
the cluster running outside of the prod-namespace and dev-namespace scopes.
When CV evaluates the check set called Prod check set it checks
the following for Pods' images running in the prod-namespace Kubernetes
namespace:
The images are stored in the trusted prod-images directory.
The images were uploaded in the last 30 days.
When CV evaluates the check set called Dev check set it
evaluates Pods running in the dev-namespace Kubernetes namespace, checking
whether images in the Pod come from the dev-images directory.
The default check set acts as a catch-all. The always-deny check ensures
that CV logs all Pods that are running in any other namespace.
To use a Kubernetes service account as the scope of a check set, replace the key
kubernetesNamespace in the example with kubernetesServiceAccount . The value
has the format my-namespace:my-service-account .
Check set scopes have the following rules:
There can be only one check set per scope in a platform policy.
If a policy contains both namespace-scoped and service account-scoped check
sets, the service account-scoped check set must be listed first, followed by
the namespace-scoped check set.
There can be only one default check set, and it must listed last.
If a platform policy contains any check sets, it must contain at least a default
check set. A platform policy with no check sets is allowed, but since there are
no checks to violate, CV doesn't produce any log entries.
Legacy CV
Caution: Legacy continuous validation (legacy CV) with project-singleton policies is deprecated . As of April 15, 2024,
you can no longer enable legacy CV with project-singleton
policies on new projects, and support for existing projects will be removed
on May 1, 2025. Instead, use continuous validation (CV) with check-based platform policies .
Existing legacy CV users can migrate project-singleton
policies to platform policies. To learn how, see
Migration .
This section describes legacy CV policies. If you're new to
CV, we recommend that you instead use CV with check-based policies .
To support legacy CV users, CV can be enabled on
projects that run GKE. CV then uses the
Binary Authorization enforcement policy to check all Pods running on all
of the clusters in the project, including clusters for which
Binary Authorization enforcement isn't enabled.
