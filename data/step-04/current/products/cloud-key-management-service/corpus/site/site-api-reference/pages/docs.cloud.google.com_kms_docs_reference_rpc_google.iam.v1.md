IAMPolicy
API Overview
Manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
Any implementation of an API that offers access control features implements the google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy interface.
Data model
Access control is applied when a principal (user or service account), takes some action on a resource exposed by a service. Resources, identified by URI-like names, are the unit of access control specification. Service implementations can choose the granularity of access control and the supported permissions for their resources. For example one database service may allow access control to be specified only at the Table level, whereas another might allow access control to also be specified at the Column level.
Policy Structure
See google.iam.v1.Policy
This is intentionally not a CRUD style API because access control policies are created and deleted implicitly with the resources to which they are attached.
GetIamPolicy
rpc GetIamPolicy( GetIamPolicyRequest ) returns ( Policy )
Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.
Authorization scopes
Requires one of the following OAuth scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudkms
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
For more information, see the Authentication Overview .
SetIamPolicy
rpc SetIamPolicy( SetIamPolicyRequest ) returns ( Policy )
Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces any existing policy.
Can return NOT_FOUND , INVALID_ARGUMENT , and PERMISSION_DENIED errors.
Authorization scopes
Requires one of the following OAuth scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudkms
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
For more information, see the Authentication Overview .
TestIamPermissions
rpc TestIamPermissions( TestIamPermissionsRequest ) returns ( TestIamPermissionsResponse )
Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.
Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.
Authorization scopes
Requires one of the following OAuth scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudkms
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
For more information, see the Authentication Overview .
AuditConfig
Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs.
If there are AuditConfigs for both allServices and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted.
Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs:
{
"audit_configs": [
{
"service": "allServices",
"audit_log_configs": [
{
"log_type": "DATA_READ",
"exempted_members": [
"user:jose@example.com"
]
},
{
"log_type": "DATA_WRITE"
},
{
"log_type": "ADMIN_READ"
}
]
},
{
"service": "sampleservice.googleapis.com",
"audit_log_configs": [
{
"log_type": "DATA_READ"
},
{
"log_type": "DATA_WRITE",
"exempted_members": [
"user:aliya@example.com"
]
}
]
}
]
}
For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging, and aliya@example.com from DATA_WRITE logging.
Fields
service
string
Specifies a service that will be enabled for audit logging. For example, storage.googleapis.com , cloudsql.googleapis.com . allServices is a special value that covers all services.
audit_log_configs[]
AuditLogConfig
The configuration for logging of each type of permission.
AuditLogConfig
Provides the configuration for logging a type of permissions. Example:
{
"audit_log_configs": [
{
"log_type": "DATA_READ",
"exempted_members": [
"user:jose@example.com"
]
},
{
"log_type": "DATA_WRITE"
}
]
}
This enables 'DATA_READ' and 'DATA_WRITE' logging, while exempting jose@example.com from DATA_READ logging.
Fields
log_type
LogType
The log type that this config enables.
exempted_members[]
string
Specifies the identities that do not cause logging for this type of permission. Follows the same format of Binding.members .
LogType
The list of valid permission types for which logging can be configured. Admin writes are always logged, and are not configurable.
Enums
LOG_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
Default case. Should never be this.
ADMIN_READ
Admin reads. Example: CloudIAM getIamPolicy
DATA_WRITE
Data writes. Example: CloudSQL Users create
DATA_READ
Data reads. Example: CloudSQL Users list
Binding
Associates members , or principals, with a role .
Fields
role
string
Role that is assigned to the list of members , or principals. For example, roles/viewer , roles/editor , or roles/owner .
For an overview of the IAM roles and permissions, see the IAM documentation . For a list of the available pre-defined roles, see here .
members[]
string
Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. members can have the following values:
allUsers : A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account.
allAuthenticatedUsers : A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation.
user:{emailid} : An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@example.com .
serviceAccount:{emailid} : An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com .
serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}] : An identifier for a Kubernetes service account . For example, my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa] .
group:{emailid} : An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com .
domain:{domain} : The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com .
principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value} : A single identity in a workforce identity pool.
principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/group/{group_id} : All workforce identities in a group.
principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value} : All workforce identities with a specific attribute value.

principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/* : All identities in a workload identity pool.
deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid} : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901 . If the user is recovered, this value reverts to user:{emailid} and the recovered user retains the role in the binding.
deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid} : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901 . If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to serviceAccount:{emailid} and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding.
deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid} : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901 . If the group is recovered, this value reverts to group:{emailid} and the recovered group retains the role in the binding.

For example, deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/my-pool-id/subject/my-subject-attribute-value .
condition
Expr
The condition that is associated with this binding.
If the condition evaluates to true , then this binding applies to the current request.
If the condition evaluates to false , then this binding does not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this binding.
To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation .
GetIamPolicyRequest
Request message for GetIamPolicy method.
Fields
resource
string
REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See Resource names for the appropriate value for this field.
options
GetPolicyOptions
OPTIONAL: A GetPolicyOptions object for specifying options to GetIamPolicy .
GetPolicyOptions
Encapsulates settings provided to GetIamPolicy.
Fields
requested_policy_version
int32
Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy.
Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected.
Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset.
The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1.
To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation .
Policy
An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.
A Policy is a collection of bindings . A binding binds one or more members , or principals, to a single role . Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition , which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true . A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation .
JSON example:
{
"bindings": [
{
"role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",
"members": [
"user:mike@example.com",
"group:admins@example.com",
"domain:google.com",
"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
]
},
{
"role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",
"members": [
"user:eve@example.com"
],
"condition": {
"title": "expirable access",
"description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020",
"expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')",
}
}
],
"etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=",
"version": 3
}
YAML example:
bindings:
- members:
- user:mike@example.com
- group:admins@example.com
- domain:google.com
- serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin
- members:
- user:eve@example.com
role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
condition:
title: expirable access
description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020
expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
etag: BwWWja0YfJA=
version: 3
For a description of IAM and its features, see the IAM documentation .
Fields
version
int32
Specifies the format of the policy.
Valid values are 0 , 1 , and 3 . Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.
Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3 . This requirement applies to the following operations:
Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions
Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.
If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.
To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation .
bindings[]
Binding
Associates a list of members , or principals, with a role . Optionally, may specify a condition that determines how and when the bindings are applied. Each of the bindings must contain at least one principal.
The bindings in a Policy can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the bindings grant 50 different roles to user:alice@example.com , and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the bindings in the Policy .
audit_configs[]
AuditConfig
Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
etag
bytes
etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy , and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy . If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.
SetIamPolicyRequest
Request message for SetIamPolicy method.
Fields
resource
string
REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See Resource names for the appropriate value for this field.
policy
Policy
REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the resource . The size of the policy is limited to a few 10s of KB. An empty policy is a valid policy but certain Google Cloud services (such as Projects) might reject them.
update_mask
FieldMask
OPTIONAL: A FieldMask specifying which fields of the policy to modify. Only the fields in the mask will be modified. If no mask is provided, the following default mask is used:
paths: "bindings, etag"
TestIamPermissionsRequest
Request message for TestIamPermissions method.
Fields
resource
string
REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See Resource names for the appropriate value for this field.
permissions[]
string
The set of permissions to check for the resource . Permissions with wildcards (such as * or storage.* ) are not allowed. For more information see IAM Overview .
TestIamPermissionsResponse
Response message for TestIamPermissions method.
Fields
permissions[]
string
A subset of TestPermissionsRequest.permissions that the caller is allowed.
