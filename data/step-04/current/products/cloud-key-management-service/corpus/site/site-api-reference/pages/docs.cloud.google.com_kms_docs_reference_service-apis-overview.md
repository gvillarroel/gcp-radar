gRPC API
REST/HTTP API
Service Endpoints
Cloud Key Management Service has both traditional REST/HTTP and
gRPC interfaces. If you don't want to use our
client libraries to access the
Cloud Key Management Service API, you have the option of writing your own client libraries that
use its REST/HTTP or gRPC API surface. We recommend this approach only if your
programming language or other needs are not met by the provided client
libraries.
g RPC API
You can generate your own gRPC client libraries in any gRPC-supported language
for the Cloud Key Management Service API from its .proto service definition using these resources:

gRPC documentation : Everything you
need to generate and use your own gRPC client code.
RPC API Reference : Language-independent overview
of the RPC surface.
REST/ HTTP API
There are a number of options for interacting with a service's REST interface.
To create your own clients, use the following resources:
REST API Reference
Guidelines for working with Google HTTP APIs
API Discovery Service :
Exposes machine readable metadata about the REST/HTTP API surface, useful for
creating client libraries, tools, and plugins.

built with REST/HTTP APIs and the Google API Discovery Service.
Service Endpoints
Cloud KMS has global and locational service endpoints. The global
REST/HTTP endpoint is https://cloudkms.googleapis.com and the
global gRPC endpoint is cloudkms.googleapis.com . The global
endpoint routes requests to a locational service in the
location specified by the resource name.
The locational REST/HTTP endpoints are
https:// <region> -cloudkms.googleapis.com and the
locational gRPC endpoints are
<region> -cloudkms.googleapis.com , substituting
<region> for any of the supported regional,
dual-regional, or multi-regional
Cloud KMS locations . These endpoints are isolated by
location, meaning each endpoint routes requests to a locational service in the
location specified by the endpoint name. If the location specified by the
resource name doesn't match the location specified by the endpoint, the request
will fail.
