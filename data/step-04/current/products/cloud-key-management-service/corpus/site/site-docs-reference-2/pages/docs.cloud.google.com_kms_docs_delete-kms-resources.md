Delete Cloud KMS resources
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows how to permanently delete Cloud Key Management Service keys
and key versions. This operation is irreversible.
In Cloud KMS, destruction and deletion are different operations:
Destruction : Disables a key version permanently, including irreversibly
destroying the underlying key material after the specified destruction
period. A key version in the DESTROYED state can't be used for
cryptographic operations and is no longer billed. You can destroy a key
version that was used to encrypt data to crypto-shred data that you want
to be permanently unrecoverable.
Destroyed key versions are still included in lists of Cloud KMS
resources.
Deletion : Removes a key or key version from lists of
Cloud KMS resources in the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI,
Cloud Key Management Service API, and client libraries. For projects with many keys or key
versions that are no longer active, deletion streamlines search and list
operations. Deleted CryptoKey names can't be reused. You can view a list of
deleted CryptoKey names that can't be reused using the
retiredResources.list
method.
Before you begin
To get the permissions that
you need to delete and view Cloud KMS resources,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Cloud KMS administrator ( roles/cloudkms.admin )
IAM role on the key.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to delete and view Cloud KMS resources. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to delete and view Cloud KMS resources:
To delete a key version:
cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.delete
To delete a key:
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.delete
To view deleted resources:
cloudkms.retiredResources.get
cloudkms.retiredResources.list
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Delete a key version
You can delete a key version if it's in the DESTROYED , IMPORT_FAILED , or
GENERATION_FAILED state. If the key version was imported, it can only be
deleted if the import failed.
To permanently delete a key version, follow these steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Key Management page.
Go to Key Management
Click the name of the key ring that contains the key and key version
that you want to delete.
Click the key that contains the key version that you want to delete.
In the Versions table, locate the key version that you want to
delete, and then click more_vert
More actions .
In the More actions menu, click Delete .
In the confirmation prompt, enter the key name and then click
Delete .
gcloud
To delete a key version, run the following command:
gcloud kms keys versions delete KEY_VERSION \
--location= LOCATION \
--keyring= KEY_RING \
--key= KEY_NAME
Replace the following:
KEY_VERSION : the number of the key version that you want to
permanently delete. The indicated key version must be in the
DESTROYED , IMPORT_FAILED , or GENERATION_FAILED state.
LOCATION : the Cloud KMS location of the key ring.
KEY_RING : the name of the key ring that contains the key.
KEY_NAME : the name of the key that contains the key version
that you want to permanently delete.

API
To delete a key version, call the
cryptoKeyVersions.delete
method. This method returns a long-running operation that you can poll
to confirm that the key version has been deleted.
curl "https://cloudkms.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING /cryptoKeys/ KEY_NAME /cryptoKeyVersions/ KEY_VERSION " \
--request "DELETE" \
--header "authorization: Bearer TOKEN "
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that contains the key ring.
LOCATION : the Cloud KMS location of the key ring.
KEY_RING : the name of the key ring that contains the key.
KEY_NAME : the name of the key that contains the key version
that you want to permanently delete.
KEY_VERSION : the number of the key version that you want to
permanently delete. The indicated key version must be in the
DESTROYED , IMPORT_FAILED , or GENERATION_FAILED state.
The output of the command returns an
Operation .
You need the name of the operation for the next step.
To confirm that the key version has been deleted, you can call the
operations.get method:
curl "https://cloudkms.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_NAME " \
--request "GET" \
--header "authorization: Bearer TOKEN "
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that contains the key ring.
LOCATION : the Cloud KMS location of the key ring.
OPERATION_NAME : the name of the operation that was
returned by the previous method.
When the output of this method shows that done is true , the
operation has finished. If no error is indicated, then the key version
has been permanently deleted.
Delete a key
You can delete a key if it meets the following conditions:
The key contains no key versions that aren't yet deleted.
The key doesn't have automatic key rotation scheduled.
The key wasn't created by Cloud KMS Autokey.
To permanently delete a key, follow these steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Key Management page.
Go to Key Management
Click the name of the key ring that contains the key that you want to
delete.
Delete the key using in either of the following locations:
Key list page : In the Keys for " KEY_RING " key ring
table, locate the key that you want to delete, click
more_vert Key actions ,
and then click Delete .
Key details page : Click the name of the key that you want to
delete to open its Key details page. At the top of the page,
click Delete .
In the confirmation prompt, enter the key name and then click
Delete .
gcloud
To delete a key, run the following command:
gcloud kms keys delete KEY_NAME \
--location= LOCATION \
--keyring= KEY_RING
Replace the following:
KEY_NAME : the name of the key that you want to permanently
delete. The key must not contain any key versions that haven't already
been deleted, and it must not be a key that was created by
Autokey.
LOCATION : the Cloud KMS location of the key ring.
KEY_RING : the name of the key ring that contains the key.

Replace the following:

LOCATION : the Cloud KMS location of the key ring.
KEY_RING : the name of the key ring that contains the key.
KEY_NAME : the name of the key that you want to permanently

OPERATION_NAME : the name of the operation that was returned by
the previous method.
When the output of this method shows that done is true , the operation
has finished. If no error is indicated, then the key has been
permanently deleted.
View names of retired resources
The names of keys that have been deleted can't be reused in the same
Google Cloud project. This prevents two different keys from having
the same resource identifier. Names for deleted keys are stored in
retiredResources objects. You can query retiredResources to view names that
can't be reused for new Cloud KMS resources.
To view a list of all retired resources, follow these steps:
gcloud
Run the following command:
gcloud kms retired-resources list \
--location= LOCATION
Replace the following:
LOCATION : the location where you want to view retired resources.
