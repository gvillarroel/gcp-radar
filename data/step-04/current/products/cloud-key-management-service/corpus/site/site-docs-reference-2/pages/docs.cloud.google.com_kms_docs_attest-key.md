Verifying attestations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide shows you how to verify attestations for Cloud HSM
keys , which are always stored in a hardware security module
(HSM). This guide applies to both Multi-tenant Cloud HSM and
Single-tenant Cloud HSM keys.
Overview
In cryptography, an attestation is a machine-readable, programmatically
provable statement that a piece of software makes about itself. Attestations are
an important component of trusted computing, and may be required for compliance
reasons.
To view and verify the attestations, you request a cryptographically-signed
attestation statement from the HSM, along with the certificate chains used
to sign it. The attestation statement is produced by the HSM hardware, and
signed by certificates owned by Google and by the HSM manufacturer.
Note: Currently, all Cloud HSM devices are manufactured by
Marvell (formerly Cavium). "Cavium" and "HSM manufacturer" are currently
interchangeable in this topic.
After downloading the attestation statement and the certificate chains, you can
check its attributes or
verify the validity of the attestation using the
certificate chains.
The attestation script is an open source
Python script developed by Google. You can view the source code for the script
to learn more about the attestation format and how verification works, or
as a model for a customized solution.
The examples in this topic are designed for Linux environments, including the
Cloud Shell . To follow along on macOS or Windows clients, you may
need to make modifications.
Before you begin
If necessary, create a Cloud HSM key on a key ring in a
region supported by Cloud HSM .
Download and install the
scripts for parsing the attestation's values .
from the HSM manufacturer. Download each of these scripts:
verify_pubkey.py
parse_v1.py
parse_v2.py
Note: Do not download verify_attest.py . Instead, use the
verification script provided by Google.
Look over the documentation for using the scripts, provided at the same
location.
Download and install the script for verifying attestations
and its prerequisites, and look over the documentation for the script.
Verifying the attestation
The attestation verification process can either be performed automatically
through the Google Cloud console, or manually by downloading the attestation bundle
and attestation verification script and
running it locally or in the Cloud Shell.
Verifying attestations through the Google Cloud console
You can verify the attestation through the Google Cloud console, which will
open a Cloud Shell and pre-populate it with the code snippets needed to
perform the entire attestation verification process.
Go to the Key Management page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Key Management page
Select the key ring that contains the key you want to attest, then select
the key.
Click More more_vert
for the key version you want to attest, and select Verify attestation .
In the Verify attestation dialog, click Open Cloud Shell . This
will open the Cloud Shell and pre-populate it with the code snippet
needed to go through the entire verification process.
Inspect the pre-populated code snippet in the Cloud Shell. The
snippet downloads the attestation verification script
and its dependencies, runs the gcloud commands to download the attestation
and certificate chains, and then runs the script to verify the attestation.
Run the code snippet to verify the attestation.
Verifying the attestation manually
The attestation, certificate chains, and attestation verification script need to
be downloaded before manually verifying the attestation.
Download the attestation and certificate chains.
Console
Go to the Key Management page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Key Management page
Select the key ring that contains the key you want to attest, then select
the key.
Click More more_vert
for the key version you want to attest, and select Verify attestation .
In the Verify attestation dialog, click Download Attestation Bundle .
This will download a zip file containing the attestation and
certificate chains.
Extract the attestation and certificate chains from the attestation
bundle.
gcloud
Click Activate Cloud Shell at the top of
the console window.
A Cloud Shell session opens inside a new frame at the bottom of
the console and displays a command-line prompt. It can take a few
seconds for the shell session to be initialized.
At the Cloud Shell command-line prompt, use the gcloud kms
keys versions describe command to retrieve the attestation for the
key that you want to attest. The --attestation-file flag specifies
the path and filename destination for the retrieved attestation.
gcloud kms keys versions describe key-version \
--key key-name \
--location location \
--keyring keyring-name \
--attestation-file [attestation-file] \
At the Cloud Shell command-line prompt, use the gcloud kms
keys versions get-certificate-chain command to retrieve the
certificate chains for the key that you want to attest. The
--output-file flag specifies the path and filename destination for
the retrieved certificates.
gcloud kms keys versions get-certificate-chain key-version \
--key key-name \
--location location \
--keyring keyring-name \
--output-file [certificates-file] \
Download the script for verifying attestations
and its prerequisites, and go through the documentation for the script
to verify the attestation in the attestation file using the certificates in
the certificates file.
Parsing the attestation's values
The HSM manufacturer's documentation
includes full instructions for using their scripts to parse an attestation's
values and verify the public key for an asymmetric key pair. The attestation
will need to be decompressed with the following command before it can be
parsed.
Uncompress the compressed attestation.
gzip -d < compressed_attestation.dat > attestation.dat
These links go directly to specific instructions from the HSM manufacturer:
Verify an asymmetric keypair's public key
Parse the attestation's values
The instructions for parsing the attestation's value include a reference of
general fields in the attestation, not specific to HSM keys in Cloud HSM.
The following sections illustrate how to verify information about your keys that
is specific to Cloud HSM.
Verify the key's version ID
You can verify whether the SHA-256 hash of the key version resource ID is
present in the attestation. The key's resource name is part of the 0x0102
field or key ID field in the attestation file. The key ID is composed of two
concatenated SHA-256 hash digests in hex format. The second one should match
the key's resource name.
Get the key version resource ID for the key version. You can use the
Google Cloud console to get the key version resource ID or
you can run the following command:
gcloud kms keys versions list \
--location location \
--keyring key-ring-name \
--key key-name
At the command line, assign resource_name to the key version resource ID
that you just retrieved.
RESOURCE_NAME="projects/ project-id /locations/ location /keyRings/ key-ring-name /cryptoKeys/ key-name /cryptoKeyVersions/ key-version "
Since the parse script dumps all attestation fields in hex format, the key
ID would have been formatted into hex format twice. (Once while creating the
keyID, the other while parsing the attestation). To verify that the resource
name matches with the key ID, convert the resource name to a SHA-256 hex digest,
revert one hex conversion of the key ID in the attestation file, and compare
the two.
RESOURCE_NAME_HEX="$(echo -n ${RESOURCE_NAME} | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex | awk '{print $2}')"
The parse script dumps all attestation fields in hex format, and the key ID
is internally hex-encoded a second time. Set the KEYID_HEX environment
variable to the value of the key ID with one layer of hex-encoding decoded:
KEYID_HEX=$(grep -m 1 0x0102 /path/to/parsed/attestation.dat | awk '{print $2}' | xxd -p -r)
Compare the values of RESOURCE_NAME_HEX and KEYID_HEX as strings:
test ${RESOURCE_NAME_HEX} == ${KEYID_HEX:(-64)} || echo "Values don't match"
If the values match, no output is returned and the command exits with code
0 .
Verify other properties of the key
You can view various key properties, which correspond to
fields in the PKCS #11 standard . Use the following
examples as guides to verify other properties of the key.
Whether a key is extractable is stored in the 0x0102 field of the parsed
output. To determine whether a key is extractable, examine the 0x0162 field.
A value of \x01 is true and a value of \x00 is false .
Cloud HSM keys are not extractable.
grep '0x0162:' /path/to/parsed/attestation.dat
How the key got into the HSM (whether it was created directly or
imported ) is stored in the 0x0163 field. If
the key was created locally on the HSM, the field is set to \x01 . An
imported key's field is set to \x00 .
You can infer a few pieces of information from how the key came to be on the
HSM. If the key was created in Cloud HSM, that means the key has
never been stored unencrypted outside of an HSM. If the key was imported, then
the import mechanism guarantees that the key is protected at transit during the
import process, and within Cloud HSM afterward.
grep '0x0163:' /path/to/parsed/attestation.dat
A key's type is stored in the 0x0100 field. Key types are documented in
the PCKS#11 standard with prefix CKK_* . For example, an AES key has a type of
\x1f .
grep '0x0100:' /path/to/parsed/attestation.dat
Additional information
You verify an attestation to determine whether a key version was created
inside an HSM.
