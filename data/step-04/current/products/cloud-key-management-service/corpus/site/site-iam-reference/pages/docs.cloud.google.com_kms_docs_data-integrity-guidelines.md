Verifying end-to-end data integrity
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page discusses using fields in the Cloud Key Management Service API to detect and prevent
unintended changes to data as it moves between client systems and
Cloud KMS. These guidelines supplement the ways that Google Cloud
automatically protects your data at rest and in
transit.
Automatic data protection
All data on Google Cloud is automatically encrypted
in transit and
at rest within
Google Cloud.
Cloud KMS takes extra steps to protect encryption keys at rest
by encrypting each encryption key using another cryptographic key called a
key encryption key (KEK). To learn more about this technique, refer to
envelope encryption .
Each Cloud KMS cryptographic operation includes automatic checks
for data corruption. If corruption is detected, the operation is aborted and
a detailed error is logged.
These automatic protections are important, but they don't prevent client-side
data corruption. For example, data corruption during encryption can lead to data
that can't be decrypted.
This topic discusses ways to detect and prevent client-side data corruption to
minimize the risk of data loss.
Note: It is strongly recommended that callers utilize the integrity verification
scheme described below to minimize the risk of data loss caused by in-transit
data corruption.
Calculating and verifying checksums
Each cryptographic operation's request and response include
CRC32C checksum
fields, such as plaintext_crc32c . You can calculate the checksum and compare
the calculated and returned values.
On the server, the Cloud Key Management Service API sets boolean fields, such as
verified_plaintext_crc32c , to true to indicate that it received the relevant
checksum, and returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error if the checksum doesn't match
the value calculated by the server.
Keep the following guidelines in mind when calculating and comparing checksums:
Calculate checksums, using a binary encoding, as soon as data is sent or
received.
Do not store unencrypted plaintext checksums to or from the Cloud Key Management Service API. For
example, do not store the unencrypted contents of the
EncryptRequest.plaintext_crc32c or DecryptResponse.plaintext_crc32c fields.
To keep a record of a checksum, serialize it along with the relevant data and
pass the compound object to Cloud KMS for encryption. When you
decrypt data, you can verify the checksum against your calculated expected
value.
If a decryption operation results in mismatched checksums, design your
application to retry the operation a limited number of times, in case of
transient problems.
If an encryption operation results in mismatched checksums for the encrypted
data (the ciphertext), discard the encrypted result and try again.
For encryption requests:
If you include the checksum field in the request, the server sets a related
verification field in the response to true
to indicate that it received the checksum and attempted to verify its value.
If you include the checksum field but the response sets the verification field to
false , the server did not receive the checksum field, and other information may
be missing from the response. Retry the request a limited number of times in case
the error is transient.
If the checksum was received but did not match, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is
returned. The error includes the name of the field and the checksum that didn't
match. For example:
The checksum in field plaintext_crc32c did not match the data in field plaintext.
Retry the request a limited number of times in case the error is transient.
For decryption requests, you can calculate a checksum and compare it to the
value of DecryptResponse.plaintext_crc32c in the response.
The following checksum fields are included in requests to and responses from the
Cloud Key Management Service API.

Verifying resource names
Responses for
Encrypt ,
GetPublicKey ,
AsymmetricSign ,
AsymmetricDecrypt ,
Decapsulate ,
MacSign ,
and
MacVerify ,
include a name field that contains the name of the relevant Cloud Key Management Service API
object. You can compare the value of the name field to the value you expect,
and discard results that do not match.
Note: The EncryptRequest.name field can contain either a CryptoKey name or a
CryptoKeyVersion name. However, the EncryptResponse.name field always contains
a CryptoKeyVersion name. To convert a CryptoKeyVersion name to a CryptoKey
name, strip /cryptoKeyVersions/ and its value (such as /cryptoKeyVersions/2 )
from the field.
