Create protected resources using Cloud KMS Autokey
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to create protected resources using keys created by
Cloud KMS Autokey for encryption. For more information about
Autokey, see Autokey overview .
Note: CreateKeyHandle requests can intermittently complete slowly or time out
after 5 minutes. If the request has timed out, retry the operation.
Before you begin
Before you can create protected resources using Autokey, you must
complete the following steps to prepare:
If you don't already have a project where Autokey is enabled for
either centralized or delegated key management, then you must first
complete the setup steps in Enable
Cloud KMS Autokey , and then return to this document.
You need permissions to create resources in the chosen project. To find
the specific roles required for each resource, see the service-specific
documentation. You can find this documentation by locating the service in
the CMEK
integrations table and visiting the link for the type of resource that
you want to create. No additional permissions are required to use
Autokey to request keys on demand.
Using Autokey with Compute Engine resources
Autokey creates a new key for each disk, image, and machine image in
the same location as the resource that is being created.
Autokey doesn't create new keys for snapshots. Snapshots should use the
same key used to encrypt the disk. If you create a snapshot using the
Google Cloud console, the encryption key used by the disk is automatically
applied to the snapshot.
If you create a snapshot using the gcloud CLI, Terraform, or the
Compute Engine API, you must identify the key used to encrypt the disk and
use that key to encrypt the snapshot.
For more information about using CMEK with snapshots, see Create a snapshot
from a disk encrypted with CMEK .
Create a protected Compute Engine resource
Console
To create a disk, complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Disks page.
Go to Disks
Click Create disk and enter the properties for the new disk.
Under Encryption , select Cloud KMS key .
For Key type , select Cloud KMS with Autokey , and then click
Request a new key . A message indicates when your key has been
successfully created and is ready for use.
To finish creating the disk, click Create .
You can follow a similar process to create protected VM instance, image,
and machine image resources.
Terraform
The following Terraform sample creates a key handle and uses
the returned key to protect a new persistent disk resource:
resource "google_kms_key_handle" "my_key_handle" {
provider = google-beta
project = " RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID "
name = " KEY_HANDLE "
location = " LOCATION "
resource_type_selector = "compute.googleapis.com/Disk"
}
resource "google_compute_disk" "persistent_disk" {
project = " RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID "
name = " DISK_NAME "
type = "pd-ssd"
zone = " ZONE "
size = 30
physical_block_size_bytes = 4096
disk_encryption_key {
kms_key_self_link = google_kms_key_handle.my_key_handle.kms_key
}
}
Replace the following:
RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID : the project
ID of the resource project where Autokey is enabled and where you want
to create a protected resource.
KEY_HANDLE : an ID to use for the key handle.
LOCATION : the location where you want to create the protected
resource.
DISK_NAME : the name of the new disk.
ZONE : the zone of the protected resource. This must
be a zone within the location where you are creating the resource. For
example, if you are creating the resource in the location us-central1 ,
the zone could be us-central1-a .
Cloud KMS doesn't let you delete
KeyHandle resources. If you're using a create-and-destroy pattern, attempting
to recreate a KeyHandle produces an ALREADY_EXISTS error. To avoid this
issue, you can import a previously-created KeyHandle . For more information,
see Create and destroy patterns in Terraform on this
page.
API
Request a new Cloud KMS key by creating a
KeyHandle :
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: USER_PROJECT " \
-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " \
-X POST https://cloudkms.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyHandles \
-d '{"resource_type_selector": " RESOURCE_TYPE "}'
Replace the following:
USER_PROJECT : the project to be billed
for charges associated with this request.
RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID : the project
ID of the resource project where Autokey is enabled and where you want
to create a protected resource.
LOCATION : the location where you want to create the
protected resource.
RESOURCE_TYPE : the type of resource that you want to
create—for example, compute.googleapis.com/Disk .
The output is similar to the following:
{
"name" : "projects/ RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID " ,
"metadata" : {
"@type" : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.kms.v1.CreateKeyHandleMetadata"
}
}
Make note of the OPERATION_ID from the output. You need this
value to get the resource ID of the created key.
Find the Cloud KMS key associated with the key handle:
curl -H "X-Goog-User-Project: USER_PROJECT " \
-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " \
-X GET https://cloudkms.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID
Replace the following:
USER_PROJECT : the project to be billed
for charges associated with this request.
RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID : the project
ID of the resource project where Autokey is enabled and where you want
to create a protected resource.
LOCATION : the location where you want to create the
protected resource.
OPERATION_ID : The identifier of the key handle request
operation from the output of the previous step.
The output is similar to the following:
{
"name" : "projects/ RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID " ,
"done" : true ,
"response" : {
"@type" : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.kms.v1.KeyHandle" ,
"name" : "projects/ RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyHandles/ KEY_HANDLE " ,
"kmsKey" : "projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/autokey/cryptoKeys/ KEY_NAME " ,
"resourceTypeSelector" : " RESOURCE_TYPE "
}
}
The value of the kmsKey element in the output is the full resource ID
of the key created by Autokey for this resource. You can use
this resource ID the same way that you use the resource ID for any
other Cloud KMS resource.
Create an encrypted disk by using the gcloud compute disks create
command , with the
--kms-key flag:
gcloud compute disks create DISK_NAME \
--kms-key projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/autokey/cryptoKeys/ KEY_NAME
Replace the following:
DISK_NAME : the name of the new disk.
KEY_PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the
project where the key was created.
LOCATION : the location where you want to create the
resource.
KEY_NAME : the name of the key returned in the output from
the previous step.
Using Autokey with Cloud Storage resources
Autokey creates a new key in the same location as the bucket. The key
created by Autokey is assigned as the bucket default key.
Autokey doesn't create keys for objects. By default, objects created in
a bucket use the bucket default key. If you want to encrypt an object using a
key other than the bucket default key, you can create a CMEK and use
that key when creating the object.
If you want to change the default key assigned to a bucket, you can use an
existing CMEK, including keys created by Autokey.
Create a protected Cloud Storage resource
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create a bucket page.
Go to Create a bucket
Follow the instructions to Create a new bucket
up to the instruction Choose how to protect object data .
Under Choose how to protect object data , expand the Data
encryption section, and then select Cloud KMS key .
For Key type , select Cloud KMS with Autokey , and then click
Request a new key . A message indicates when your key has been
successfully created and is ready for use.
To finish creating the bucket, click Create .
Terraform
The following Terraform sample creates a key handle and uses
the returned key to protect a new storage bucket:
resource "google_kms_key_handle" "my_key_handle" {
provider = google-beta
project = " RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID "
name = " KEY_HANDLE "
location = " LOCATION "
resource_type_selector = "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket"
}
resource "google_storage_bucket" "simple_bucket_name" {
name = " BUCKET_NAME "
location = " LOCATION "
force_destroy = true
project = " RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID "
uniform_bucket_level_access = true
encryption {
default_kms_key_name = google_kms_key_handle.my_key_handle.kms_key
}
}
Replace the following:
RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID : the project
ID of the resource project where Autokey is enabled and where you want
to create a protected resource.
KEY_HANDLE : an ID to use for the key handle.
LOCATION : the location where you want to create the protected
resource.
BUCKET_NAME : the name of the new bucket.
Cloud KMS doesn't let you delete
KeyHandle resources. If you're using a create-and-destroy pattern, attempting
to recreate a KeyHandle produces an ALREADY_EXISTS error. To avoid this
issue, you can import a previously-created KeyHandle . For more information,
see Create and destroy patterns in Terraform on this
page.
API
Request a new Cloud KMS key by creating a
KeyHandle :
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: USER_PROJECT " \

"resourceTypeSelector" : " RESOURCE_TYPE "
}
}
The value of the kmsKey element in the output is the full resource ID
of the key created by Autokey for this resource. You can use
this resource ID the same way you would use the resource ID for any
other Cloud KMS resource.
Create an encrypted bucket by using the gcloud storage buckets create
command , with the
--default-encryption-key flag:
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--default-encryption-key = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/autokey/cryptoKeys/ KEY_NAME
Replace the following:
BUCKET_NAME : the name of the new bucket. The
bucket name must follow the
bucket naming requirements .
LOCATION : the location where you want to create the
bucket.
KEY_PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the
project where the key was created.
LOCATION : the location where you want to create the
resource.
KEY_NAME : the name of the key returned in the output from
the previous step.
Using Autokey with BigQuery resources
Cloud KMS is available in several editions of BigQuery. Make
sure the edition of BigQuery that you are using is compatible with
Cloud KMS before you try to use Autokey to protect
BigQuery resources. For more information about BigQuery
editions, see Understand BigQuery editions .
For each new dataset, Autokey creates a new key, in the same location
as the resource itself, which becomes the dataset default key.
Autokey doesn't create keys for tables, queries, temporary tables, or
models. By default, these resources are protected by the dataset default key. If
you want to protect a resource in a dataset using a key other than the dataset
default key, you can manually create a CMEK and use that key when creating the
resource.
For queries and temporary tables that are not inside a dataset, use project
default keys. Use a different project default key for each location in the
project that contains BigQuery resources. For more information about
using project default keys, see
Set a project default key .
For more information about using CMEK with BigQuery, see
Customer-managed Cloud KMS keys .
Create a protected BigQuery resource
Console
Before attempting to create a BigQuery dataset using
Autokey, make sure you have the required permissions. For more
information about creating datasets, see Create datasets .
In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.
Go to BigQuery
Follow the instructions to Create a dataset until
you get to Advanced options > Encryption .
Under Encryption select Cloud KMS key .
For Key type , select Cloud KMS with Autokey , and then click
Request a new key . A message indicates when your key has been
successfully created and is ready for use.
To finish creating the dataset, click Create dataset .
Terraform

command-line tool .
Using Autokey with Secret Manager resources
Autokey creates a single key to protect all secrets in the same project
and location. When the key rotates, new secrets added to the project use the new
primary version of the key.
Secret Manager is only compatible with Cloud KMS Autokey when
creating resources using Terraform or the REST API.
Create a protected Secret Manager resource
Terraform
The following Terraform sample creates a key handle and uses
the returned key to protect a new secret with automatic replication:
resource "google_kms_key_handle" "my_key_handle" {
provider = google-beta
project = " RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID "
name = "test-key-handle"
location = "global"
resource_type_selector = "secretmanager.googleapis.com/Secret"
}
resource "google_secret_manager_secret" "my_secret" {
project = " RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID "
secret_id = " SECRET_ID "
replication {
auto {
customer_managed_encryption {
kms_key_name = google_kms_key_handle.my_key_handle.kms_key
}
}
}
}
Replace the following:
RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID : the project
ID of the resource project where Autokey is enabled and where you want
to create a protected resource.
SECRET_ID : the ID to use for the new secret.
If you attempt to create a key handle for a secret in the same project and
location for which a key handle already exists, an error message returns the
details of the existing key handle. If this happens, make sure that you only
have one block creating the key handle. You can reuse the key handle using
its ID ( KEY_HANDLE ) to create additional secrets that should
share the key.
Cloud KMS doesn't let you delete
KeyHandle resources. If you're using a create-and-destroy pattern, attempting
to recreate a KeyHandle produces an ALREADY_EXISTS error. To avoid this
issue, you can import a previously-created KeyHandle . For more information,
see Create and destroy patterns in Terraform on this
page.

}
}
Make note of the OPERATION_ID from the output. You need this
value to get the resource ID of the created key.
If you attempt to create a key handle for a secret in the same project
and location for which a key handle already exists, an error message
returns the details of the existing key handle. In this case, skip over
the next step and use the key resource ID in the existingKmsKey field
to protect your new secret.
Find the Cloud KMS key associated with the key handle:
curl -H "X-Goog-User-Project: USER_PROJECT " \
-H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " \

}
}
The value of the kmsKey element in the output is the full resource ID
of the key created by Autokey for this resource. You can use
this resource ID the same way you would use the resource ID for any
other Cloud KMS resource.
Create an encrypted secret with automatic replication by using the
gcloud secrets create command ,
with the --kms-key-name flag.
gcloud secrets create " SECRET_ID " \
--replication-policy "automatic" \
--kms-key-name "projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/global/keyRings/autokey/cryptoKeys/ KEY_NAME " \
--project " RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID "
Replace the following:

Create-and-destroy patterns in Terraform
Cloud KMS doesn't let you delete KeyHandle resources. If you're using
Terraform and a create-and-destroy pattern, attempting to recreate a KeyHandle
produces an ALREADY_EXISTS error. You can avoid this issue by using an
