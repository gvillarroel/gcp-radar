Additional authenticated data
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Additional authenticated data (AAD) is any string that you pass to
Cloud Key Management Service as part of an encrypt or decrypt request. AAD is used as an
integrity check and can help protect your data from a
confused deputy attack . The AAD string must be no larger than 64 KiB.
Cloud KMS will not decrypt ciphertext unless the same AAD value is
used for both encryption and decryption.
AAD is bound to the encrypted data, because you cannot decrypt the ciphertext
unless you know the AAD, but it is not stored as part of the ciphertext. AAD also
does not increase the cryptographic strength of the ciphertext. Instead it is an
additional check by Cloud KMS to authenticate a decryption request.
In Cloud KMS, AAD is always present when you make a call to encrypt
or decrypt - if you do not provide a value for AAD, then an empty string is
used. If an empty string is used as the AAD for the encryption of plaintext,
then only an empty string will allow decryption of the ciphertext.
AAD is not logged by Cloud Audit Logs .
Warning: Ensure that you securely store the AAD, or have the ability to
reproduce the AAD, because without the AAD you will not be able to decrypt your
ciphertext.
When to use AAD
One example of using AAD is when your application serves as a wrap/unwrap proxy
with a single key and an unbounded number of clients, with each client in
distinct security boundaries. For example, the application could be a diary
application that allows users to maintain a private diary. When a user needs to
view a private diary entry, the application can use the unique user name as the
AAD in the unwrap (decrypt) request to explicitly authenticate the user. In this
scenario you can use a single key to serve multiple (unbounded) users. A primary
benefit is you don't need to maintain state for individual users.
Another example is if your application needs to use bearer tokens that contain
some private information, such as an email address. Inputs to the bearer token
would be the authenticated data used for a bearer token plus the plaintext email
address. These inputs would then get encrypted so the bearer token that gets
exchanged is in the form of Additional Encrypted Authenticated Data (AEAD).
Confused deputy attack example
This example shows how an application could be tricked into decrypting
ciphertext on behalf of a malicious user. The application is the confused deputy
in this example because the application is unaware the attacker has tricked the
application into misusing its authority. The result is the attacker is able to
view decrypted data that originally was encrypted for another user. Note in this
attack, the attacker does not need to know the encryption key, because it relies
on the confused deputy to perform the decryption.
A diary application allows users to maintain a private diary. Each diary
entry is encrypted and intended to be decrypted only by the user that created
the diary entry.
Alice creates a diary entry. The application encrypts the diary entry and
then stores the encrypted diary entry at a location reserved for diary entries
that belong to Alice.
Alice sends a request to view her diary entry. Because the encrypted diary
entry is at a location reserved for Alice, the application decrypts the data and
returns it as the response to Alice's request. This is the intended behaviour of
the application.
Mallory copies Alice's diary entry from the location reserved for Alice
to the location reserved for Mallory.
Mallory sends a request to view Mallory's copy of Alice's diary entry.
Because the copy of Alice's diary entry is at a location reserved for Mallory,
the application decrypts the diary entry and returns the plaintext as the
response to Mallory's request. Mallory can then view Alice's diary entry, which
is not the intended behaviour of the application.
To defend against this type of attack, the application can use a non-empty
string as AAD for encryption and decryption. The AAD provides an extra
check for decryption requests. When Mallory sends the decryption request to view
Mallory's copy of Alice's diary entry, Mallory's request will not succeed unless
Mallory can also trick the application into using the correct AAD.
Storing or reproducing AAD
Before encrypting with AAD, decide whether you will store the AAD side-by-side
with the encrypted data, or reproduce the AAD, for subsequent decryption.
A reason to store AAD is to make it straightforward to use the AAD when you need
to decrypt ciphertext. For example, a database row could contain both the
ciphertext and the AAD used when the plaintext was encrypted. When a decrypt
request is received, the application can retrieve both the AAD and the
ciphertext from the database. The application can then use the AAD for the
ciphertext decryption process.
A reason to reproduce AAD is to verify any non-private data while also avoiding
storage of the AAD. For example, if you want to ensure that the filepath and
filename of an encrypted file has not changed, you can include the filepath and
filename as AAD when you encrypt the file. Then, when a decrypt request is sent
for the file, you can reproduce the AAD by examining the filepath and filename.
Storing AAD
Storing AAD means AAD is saved and then readily available by your application
for future use. For example, a database table could contain a column for
ciphertext and a column for the AAD used when the ciphertext was created. When
it is time to decrypt the ciphertext, the application retrieves the AAD and uses
it for the decryption.
Warning: If you store AAD, ensure that you keep it secure.
Consider a diary application that is designed to show a diary entry only to the
user that created it. When a diary entry is created, it is encrypted and then
saved to a database, in column ENCRYPTED_DIARY_ENTRY . For each request to view
a diary entry, the application authenticates the user and then provides the
diary entry to the user.
Suppose no AAD is used (other than the default empty string) and hypothetically
Mallory was able to copy Alice's ENCRYPTED_DIARY_ENTRY data to Mallory's
ENCRYPTED_DIARY_ENTRY data. When Mallory sends a decrypt request for Mallory's
ENCRYPTED_DIARY_ENTRY data (which was copied from Alice's data), the
application performs the decryption without realizing it has been tricked.
Mallory is able to see Alice's diary entry as plaintext.
Now let's suppose the user email address is used as the AAD when a diary entry
is encrypted. When Alice creates a diary entry, the application stores her
unencrypted email address in the column EMAIL , side-by-side with the
ENCRYPTED_DIARY_ENTRY data. Let's suppose again that Mallory was able to copy
Alice's ENCRYPTED_DIARY_ENTRY data to Mallory's ENCRYPTED_DIARY_ENTRY data.
When Mallory sends a decrypt request, the application retrieves Mallory's email
address from the EMAIL column to use as the AAD for the decrypt request.
Mallory's email address will not succeed as the AAD for decryption, so the
application does not let Mallory see Alice's diary entry as plaintext.
Reproducing AAD
Reproducing AAD means it isn't stored anywhere, but you can reproduce when it is
time for decryption.
Warning: If you do not store the AAD and you cannot reproduce the AAD, you will
not be able to decrypt the ciphertext.
As an example, you can use a filepath and filename as AAD. During the encryption
process, suppose the encrypted file was saved to MY_PATH\MY_FILE1.enc , so
"MY_PATH\MY_FILE1.enc" was used as the AAD. This AAD is not stored. When a
decrypt request is received, the application reproduces the AAD by examining the
filepath and filename of the file to decrypt. If the encrypted file has not been
moved to another location, "MY_PATH\MY_FILE1.enc" will be used as the AAD
during decryption, which is the same as the AAD used during encryption, so the
decryption can proceed.
If the encrypted file has been moved, for example to
SOME_OTHER_PATH\MY_FILE1.enc , then "SOME_OTHER_PATH\MY_FILE1.enc" will be
used as the AAD for decryption. This AAD value does not match the AAD value used
for encryption, so the decryption will fail.
