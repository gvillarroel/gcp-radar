Configuring OpenSSL for manual key wrapping
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Before you can import a key into Cloud KMS, it must be wrapped
using the
PKCS#11
CKM_RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP scheme, which includes both RSA-OAEP (which is included
in OpenSSL 1.1 by default) and AES Key Wrap
with Padding (which is not). That mechanism is not included in OpenSSL.
We recommend using the Google Cloud CLI to
wrap each key automatically during
the import. If you must wrap your keys manually due to compliance or regulatory
requirements, you must first recompile OpenSSL to add support for AES Key Wrap
with Padding. After recompiling OpenSSL, you can
wrap the key manually .
Important: If you use automatic wrapping, do not follow these steps.
Instead, you need to install the Pyca cryptographic library ,
which works with the OpenSSL binaries already installed on your local system.
The Google Cloud CLI can use that library to automatically wrap your key during
the import request.
Before you begin
Caution: These steps require advanced knowledge of Linux. Most
users should allow the Google Cloud CLI command to
automatically wrap and import
keys instead of following the instructions in this topic.
Do not overwrite your system's built-in OpenSSL binaries with the
patched binaries produced by following the procedures in this topic. For example,
do not install the patched OpenSSL directly into /usr . If you follow this
procedure exactly, the patched OpenSSL is built in $HOME/build and installed
into $HOME/local/bin .
If ${HOME}/local/bin already exists, back up its contents or move those files
elsewhere before following the steps in this topic.
Patch and install OpenSSL v1.1.0
If you choose to use OpenSSL to manually wrap your keys before importing them
into Cloud KMS, OpenSSL v1.1.0 is required, with the following
patch applied. You will need to compile OpenSSL and install it into a location
separate from your system's default OpenSSL installation.
Download the source for OpenSSL 1.1.0l release from
https://www.openssl.org/source .
This is the latest release in the 1.1.0 code line. Do not use a newer
version of OpenSSL, such as v1.1.1, in this procedure. The patch will fail
to apply.
Extract the archive to ${HOME}/build/openssl/ using the following command.
This command overrides the default directory, which includes the version of
OpenSSL and changes often. Replace
/path/to/downloaded-openssl.tar.gz with the path to the downloaded
.tar.gz archive.
# Create the directory for the eventual OpenSSL binaries
mkdir -p ${HOME}/local/ssl
# Create the build directory
mkdir -p ${HOME}/build/openssl
# Extract the archive to ${HOME}/build/openssl
tar xzvf /path/to/downloaded-openssl.tar.gz \
-C ${HOME}/build/openssl/ \
--strip-components 1
Apply a custom patch to the extracted OpenSSL source, using the following
commands.The patch enables the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_FLAG_WRAP_ALLOW flag.
Warning: This patch fails to apply to versions of OpenSSL other than v1.1.0l.
cd ${HOME}/build
cat <<-EOF | patch -d . -p0

BIO_printf(bio_err, "Error setting cipher %s\n",
EOF
Run the following commands to build the OpenSSL binaries and libraries from
the patched source, test the build for validity, and install the binaries
and libraries into the ${HOME}/local directory.
CPUS=$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
cd ${HOME}/build/openssl
./config --prefix=${HOME}/local --openssldir=${HOME}/local/ssl
make -j${CPUS}
make test
make install
Do not omit or modify the --prefix or --openssldir flags, to ensure that
you do not overwrite the system's OpenSSL installation.
Run the following command to check that the new OpenSSL binary installed
successfully:
test -x ${HOME}/local/bin/openssl || echo FAIL
You should see no output if the binaries are installed correctly. If you see
FAIL , check the output of the make , make test , and make install
commands you ran earlier.
The patched OpenSSL binaries are dynamically linked against the OpenSSL
libraries in ${HOME}/local/ssl/lib/ , but the ld command does not
index these libraries by default. Run the following commands to create a
wrapper script that adds the patched libraries to the ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
before invoking the CLI for the patched OpenSSL.
cat > ${HOME}/local/bin/openssl.sh <<-EOF
#!/bin/bash
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/local/lib/ ${HOME}/local/bin/openssl "\$@"
EOF
chmod u+x ${HOME}/local/bin/openssl.sh
Check that the version of OpenSSL that the script starts is the version you
just built and installed, using the following command:
${HOME}/local/bin/openssl.sh version
You can now invoke the ${HOME}/local/bin/openssl.sh wrapper script to
manually wrap keys for import .
