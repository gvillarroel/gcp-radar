Use Public NAT with Compute Engine
This page shows a demonstration of a Public NAT gateway that provides
network address translation services for a Compute Engine VM instance. Before
you begin, read the Public NAT overview .
Prerequisites
You need to do the following before setting up Public NAT.
Get IAM permissions
The roles/compute.networkAdmin
role gives you permissions to create a NAT gateway on Cloud Router,
reserve and assign NAT IP addresses, and specify subnetworks (subnets) whose
traffic should use network address translation by the NAT gateway.
Set up Google Cloud
Before you get started, set up the following items in Google Cloud.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.

To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Note:
The Google Cloud CLI instructions on this page assume that you
have set your project ID before issuing commands. You can set a project ID
with the following command:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
You can also view a project ID that is already set:
gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)'
Example
The following is an end-to-end example that demonstrates a sample Public NAT
gateway and a sample Compute Engine VM that uses the Public NAT
gateway.
Step 1: Create a VPC network and subnet
If you already have a network and subnet, you can skip this step.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks page.
Go to the VPC networks page
Click Create VPC network .
Enter a Name of custom-network1 .
Under Subnets , set Subnet creation mode to Custom .
Under New subnet , enter a Name of subnet-us-east-192 .
In Region , select us-east4 .
Enter an IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24 .
Click Done , and then click Create .
gcloud
Create a new custom mode VPC network in your project:
gcloud compute networks create custom-network1 \
--subnet-mode custom
Specify the subnet prefix for your first region. In this example, we
assign 192.168.1.0/24 to region us-east4 .
gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-us-east-192 \
--network custom-network1 \
--region us-east4 \
--range 192.168.1.0/24
Terraform
You can use a Terraform module to create a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network
and subnet.
module "test-vpc-module" {
source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google"
version = "~> 13.0"
project_id = var.project_id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes
network_name = "custom-network1"
mtu = 1460
subnets = [
{
subnet_name = "subnet-us-east-192"
subnet_ip = "192.168.1.0/24"
subnet_region = "us-east4"
}
]
}
Step 2: Create a VM instance with no external IP address
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
Go to the VM instances page
Click Create instance .
Specify a Name of nat-test-1 for your instance.
Set the Region to us-east4 .
Set the Zone to us-east4-c .
Click the Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy link.
Click the Networking tab.
Under Network interfaces , click
edit Edit
for the VM's default interface.
Set the Network to custom-network1 .
Set the Subnetwork to subnet-us-east-192 .
Set External IP to None .
Click Done .
To create and start the instance, click Create .
gcloud
gcloud compute instances create nat-test-1 \
--image-family debian-9 \
--image-project debian-cloud \
--network custom-network1 \
--subnet subnet-us-east-192 \
--zone us-east4-c \
--no-address
Terraform
You can use a Terraform resource
to create a VM instance.
resource "google_compute_instance" "default" {
project = var.project_id
zone = "us-east4-c"
name = "nat-test-1"
machine_type = "e2-medium"
boot_disk {
initialize_params {
image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
}
}
network_interface {
network = "custom-network1"
subnetwork = var.subnet # Replace with a reference or self link to your subnet, in quotes
}
}
Step 3: Create a firewall rule that allows SSH connections
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Firewall policies page.
Go to the Firewall policies page
Click Create firewall rule .
Enter a Name of allow-ssh .
Specify a Network of custom-network1 .
Set Direction of traffic to Ingress .
Set Action on match to Allow .
Set Targets to All instances in the network .
Set Source filter to IPv4 ranges .
Set Source IP ranges to 35.235.240.0/20 .
Set Protocols and ports to Specified protocols and ports .
Select the tcp checkbox and enter port 22 .
Click Create .
gcloud
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-ssh \
--network custom-network1 \
--source-ranges 35.235.240.0/20 \
--allow tcp:22
Terraform
You can use a Terraform resource
to create a firewall rule.
resource "google_compute_firewall" "rules" {
project = var.project_id
name = "allow-ssh"
network = var.network # Replace with a reference or self link to your network, in quotes
allow {
protocol = "tcp"
ports = ["22"]
}
source_ranges = ["35.235.240.0/20"]
}
Step 4: Create IAP SSH permissions for your test instance
In a later step, use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) to connect to your test
instance.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Identity-Aware Proxy page.
Go to the Identity-Aware Proxy page
Select the SSH and TCP resources tab.
To update member permissions on resources, select the checkbox next to
All Tunnel Resources > us-east4-c > nat-test-1 .
In the right pane, click Add member .
To grant users, groups, or service accounts access to the resources,
in the New members field, specify their email addresses.
If you are just testing this feature, you can enter your own email
address.
To grant the members access to the resources through Cloud
IAP's TCP forwarding feature, in the Role drop-down
list, select Cloud IAP > IAP-secured Tunnel User .
Click Save .
gcloud
This command grants SSH access by using IAP to all VM
instances in your project. If you want to grant SSH access by using
IAP to an individual VM, use the Google Cloud console
instructions.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member= MEMBER_INFO \
--role=roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
MEMBER_INFO : a comma-separated list of
member type:email pairs. Examples:
For an individual user: user:test-user@example.com
For a group: group:admins@example.com
For a service account: serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com
Terraform
You can use a Terraform resource
to create IAP SSH permissions for your test instance.
resource "google_project_iam_member" "project" {
project = var.project_id
role = "roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor"
member = "serviceAccount:test123@example.domain.com"
}
Step 5: Log in to nat-test-1 and confirm that it cannot reach the internet
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
Go to the VM instances page
For nat-test-1 , in the Connect column, click the SSH drop-down
arrow, and then select Open in browser window .
At the command prompt of the VM, enter curl example.com and then press
Enter.
You should get no result. If you do, you might have created nat-test-1
with an external IP address, or there might be some other problem.
To troubleshoot, see
VMs can reach the internet unexpectedly without Cloud NAT .
To end the command, you might have to enter Ctrl+C .
gcloud
Add a Compute Engine SSH key to your local host:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine
Connect to nat-test-1 and run a command:
gcloud compute ssh nat-test-1 \
--zone us-east4-c \
--command "curl example.com" \
--tunnel-through-iap
You should get no result. If you do, you might have created nat-test-1
with an external IP address, or there might be some other problem.
To troubleshoot, see
VMs can reach the internet unexpectedly without Cloud NAT .
To end the command, you might have to enter Ctrl+C .
Step 6: Create a NAT configuration using Cloud Router
You must create the Cloud Router in the same region as the instances
that use Public NAT. Cloud Router is only used to place NAT
information onto the VMs. It is not used as part of the actual NAT gateway.
This configuration allows all instances in the region to use Public NAT
for all primary and alias IP ranges . It also automatically
allocates the external IP addresses for the NAT gateway. For more options, see
the Google Cloud CLI documentation.
Note: Public NAT uses Cloud Router only to group NAT
configuration information (control plane). Public NAT does not
direct a Cloud Router to use BGP or to add routes. NAT traffic does
not pass through a Cloud Router (data plane).
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud NAT page.
Go to the Cloud NAT page
Click Get started or Create NAT gateway .
Enter a Gateway name of nat-config .
Set the VPC network to custom-network1 .
Set the Region to us-east4 .
Under Cloud Router , select Create new router .
Enter a Name of nat-router .
Click Create .
Click Create .
gcloud
Create a Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers create nat-router \
--network custom-network1 \
--region us-east4
Add a configuration to the router:
gcloud compute routers nats create nat-config \
--router-region us-east4 \
--router nat-router \
--nat-all-subnet-ip-ranges \
--auto-allocate-nat-external-ips
Terraform
You can use a Terraform resource
to create a Cloud Router.
resource "google_compute_router" "router" {
project = var.project_id
name = "nat-router"
network = var.network
region = "us-east4"
}
You can use a Terraform module
to create a NAT configuration.
module "cloud-nat" {
source = "terraform-google-modules/cloud-nat/google"
version = "~> 5.0"
project_id = var.project_id
region = "us-east4"
router = google_compute_router.router.name
name = "nat-config"
source_subnetwork_ip_ranges_to_nat = "ALL_SUBNETWORKS_ALL_IP_RANGES"
}
Step 7: Attempt to connect to the internet again
It might take up to three minutes for the NAT configuration to propagate to the VM,
so wait at least a minute before trying to access the internet again.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
Go to the VM instances page
For nat-test-1 , in the Connect column, click the SSH drop-down
arrow, and then select Open in browser window .
At the command prompt of the VM, enter curl example.com and then press
Enter.
gcloud
Connect to nat-test-1 and run a command:
gcloud compute ssh nat-test-1 \
--zone us-east4-c \
--command "curl example.com" \
--tunnel-through-iap
You should see output that contains the following content:
