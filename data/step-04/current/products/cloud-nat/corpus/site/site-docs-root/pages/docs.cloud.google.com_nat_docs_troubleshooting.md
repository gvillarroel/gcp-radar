Troubleshoot configuration
This guide can help you solve common issues with Cloud NAT.
Common issues
VMs can reach the internet unexpectedly, without Cloud NAT
If your virtual machine (VM) instances or container instances can reach the
internet without Cloud NAT, but you don't want them to, check for the
following issues:
Determine if the VM's network interface has an external IP address. If the
network interface has an external IP address assigned to it, Google Cloud
automatically performs one-to-one NAT for packets whose sources match the
interface's primary internal IP address. For more information, see
Cloud NAT specifications .
To determine if a VM has an external IP address, see changing or
assigning an external IP address to an existing
instance .
Ensure that your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster is a private
cluster . Each node VM in
a non-private cluster has an external IP address, so each node can use
routes in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network whose next hop is the default
internet gateway without relying on Cloud NAT. For
more information, including how non-private clusters interact with
Cloud NAT gateways, see
Compute Engine interaction .
List routes in your Virtual Private Cloud
network, looking for ones that could provide internet connectivity through
a next hop different than the default internet gateway. As examples:
Static routes whose next
hops are VMs, internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, or Cloud VPN
tunnels might indirectly provide internet connectivity. For example, the
next hop VMs or backend VMs for an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer might
have external IP addresses themselves, or a Cloud VPN tunnel
might connect to a network that offers internet access.
Dynamic routes learned from
on-premises networks by Cloud Routers in your VPC
network might connect to a network that offers internet access.
Keep in mind that other custom routes in your VPC network might
have higher priorities than routes whose next hops are default internet
gateways. For information about how
Google Cloud evaluates routes, see routing applicability and
order .
No logs are generated
Verify that NAT logging is enabled .
Double-check that your view of the logs isn't filtering out the logs that you
are looking for. For instructions, see
Viewing logs .
Make sure that a firewall rule isn't blocking traffic. Firewall rules that
block egress (outbound) traffic are applied before the traffic would have been
sent to the NAT gateway. You can use
Firewall Rules Logging to see if
your custom egress rules are blocking outbound traffic.
Review Types of Cloud NAT .
The destination for your traffic might not be handled by NAT.
Certain logs are excluded
Verify that NAT logging is enabled and
that your log filter is not excluding logs that you want to keep. You can clear
a logs filter so that nothing is
excluded.
Cloud NAT does not log every single event. During periods of
heavy egress traffic, NAT logging is throttled, proportional to the machine
type of the VM. Translation or error logs might be dropped, and it is not
possible to determine what is omitted during throttling.
Packets dropped with reason: out of resources
If you see packet loss from VMs that use Cloud NAT, this might be
because there are not enough available NAT source IP address and source port
tuples for the VM to use at the time of the packet loss (port exhaustion). A
five-tuple (NAT source IP address, source port, and destination 3-tuple) cannot
be reused within the TCP TIME_WAIT timeout .
If there aren't enough available NAT tuples, the dropped_sent_packets_count
reason is
OUT_OF_RESOURCES . For more information about metrics, see Using VM instance
metrics .
See Reduce your port usage for ways to reduce port usage.
If you use dynamic port allocation, see the following section for ways to reduce
packet drops when dynamic port allocation is used.
Packets dropped when dynamic port allocation is configured
Dynamic port allocation detects when a VM is close to being out of
ports, and doubles the number of ports that are allocated to the VM. This helps
ensure that ports aren't wasted, but can result in dropped packets while the
number of allocated ports is increasing.
To reduce the number of dropped packets, consider the following:
If you can ramp up connections more slowly, Cloud NAT has more
time to allocate more ports.
If VMs are making TCP connections, you can configure the VMs with a larger
value for tcp_syn_retries , which gives the system more time to establish
the connection and increases the chances for the connection to succeed.
For example, for Linux VMs, you can view the current setting:
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries
If needed you can increase the setting:
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries= NUM
Note: Increasing the value for tcp_syn_retries can lead to latency
because the system keeps dropping packets until the connection succeeds
after multiple retries.
If you have bursty workloads and need to quickly allocate more ports, you
might need to adjust the minimum number of ports per VM. View
your port
usage
and determine an appropriate minimum number of ports per
VM .
Packets dropped with reason: endpoint independence conflict
Note: This section doesn't apply to Private NAT.
If you see packet loss from VMs that use Public NAT, and you have
Endpoint-Independent Mapping turned on, the packet loss might be caused by an
endpoint independent
conflict . If it is, the
dropped_sent_packets_count
reason is
ENDPOINT_INDEPENDENCE_CONFLICT . For more information about metrics, see Using
VM instance metrics .
You can reduce the chances of endpoint independent conflicts by using the
following techniques:
Turn off Endpoint-Independent Mapping .
This allows the new connection from a given source IP address and port to
use a different NAT source IP address and port than it used before. Disabling
or enabling Endpoint-Independent Mapping does not interrupt established
connections.
Increase the minimum default number of NAT ports per VM
instance ,
so that the port reservation
procedure can
assign more NAT source IP address and source port tuples to each client VM.
This decreases the probability that two or more client IP address and
ephemeral source port tuples are assigned the same NAT source IP address and
source port tuple.
Check how many ephemeral source ports are being used:
For Linux VMs:
netstat -an | egrep 'ESTABLISHED|TIME_WAIT|CLOSE_WAIT' | wc -l
For Windows VMs:
netstat -tan | findstr "ESTABLISHED TIME_WAIT CLOSE_WAIT" | find /c /v ""
Configure your VM instances to use a larger set of ephemeral source ports:
For Linux VMs:
You can view what port range is configured with this command:
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
You can set the ip_local_port_range to the maximum number
of ephemeral source ports (64,512) with this command:
echo 1024 65535 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
For Windows VMs:
You can view what port ranges are configured with these commands:
netsh int ipv4 show dynamicport tcp
netsh int ipv4 show dynamicport udp
You can set the number of ephemeral source TCP and UDP ports
to the maximum possible (64,512) with these commands:
netsh int ipv4 set dynamicport tcp start=1024 num=64512
netsh int ipv4 set dynamicport udp start=1024 num=64512
On Google Kubernetes Engine nodes, you can automate this configuration by using
a privileged DaemonSet .
For GKE clusters, disable the source NAT performed on each
node for packets sent to destinations of interest. You can do this in one of
two ways:
By deploying the
ip-masq-agent
and adding the destinations of interest to the list of
nonMasqueradeCIDRs .
By disabling SNAT for the default non-masquerade
destinations
with the
--disable-default-snat flag
when you create a cluster.
Dropped received packets
A Cloud NAT gateway maintains a connection tracking table to store active
connection details and IP address and port mappings—how VM IP addresses and ports
translate to NAT IP addresses and ports. A Cloud NAT gateway drops an ingress
data packet if the connection tracking table doesn't
contain any entry for the connection.
The absence of the connection entry in the table can be due to any of the following
reasons:
An established TCP connection timed out because the TCP Established Connection
Idle Timeout expired due to inactivity.
An external endpoint fails to establish a new connection before the TCP Transitory
Connection Idle Timeout expired. For example, a Google Cloud resource
initiates a connection with TCP SYN , but the external endpoint fails to respond
with a SYN ACK .
An external endpoint, such as a prober, tries to connect to a NAT IP address
and port. Cloud NAT doesn't accept unsolicited inbound connections.
Entries for these type of connections won't be present in the connection table.
So, any received packets will be dropped.
If you remove NAT IPs from your gateway while NAT connections are still active,
then the NAT Mappings become invalid, and these connections are immediately
removed from the connection tracking table—any return traffic is dropped.
Before you address the ingress packet drops, confirm if the drops actually impact
your application. To confirm, check your application for errors whenever spikes
in dropped ingress packets occur.
If the ingress packet drops do impact your application, try using the following
techniques to address the issue:
Use keepalive mechanisms in your application, so that long-running connections
can stay open for a longer period.
Increase the value for TCP Transitory Connection Idle Timeout, so that
external endpoints that receive traffic (initiated by Google Cloud resources)
through a Cloud NAT gateway get more time to respond and to establish
the connection.
Increase the value for TCP Established Connection Idle Timeout if you have
significantly decreased the default value.
Note: Increasing the value for TCP Transitory Connection Idle Timeout and TCP
Established Connection Idle Timeout impact the way a Cloud NAT reuses
ports. The gateway keeps a port mapped to the connection for a longer duration,
even if the connection fails to establish or if the connection doesn't receive any
traffic for a while.
Need to allocate more IP addresses
Sometimes your VMs are unable to reach the internet because you don't have
enough NAT IP addresses . Multiple
factors can cause this problem. For more information, see the following table.
Root cause
Symptom
Solution
You've manually allocated addresses, but you haven't allocated enough
of them, given your current port usage.
The Google Cloud console displays an error that reads You need
to allocate at least 'X' more IP addresses to allow all instances to
access the internet .
The value of the
nat_allocation_failed
metric is true .
Do one of the following:
Minimize your port usage, as described in
Reduce your port usage .
Manually add more IP addresses, as described in
Update external IP addresses associated with NAT .
You have surpassed a hard limit
for NAT IP addresses.
The value of the
nat_allocation_failed
metric is true .
Minimize your port usage, as described in
Reduce your port usage .
To monitor failures caused by an insufficient number of IP addresses,
create an alert for the
nat_allocation_failed
metric. This metric is set to true if Google Cloud is unable to
allocate sufficient IP addresses for any VM in your NAT gateway. For
information about alert policies, see
Defining alerting policies.
Reduce your port usage
You can minimize the number of ports that each VM uses in situations where
allocating more NAT IP addresses is not possible or desirable.
Important: If you need Endpoint-Independent Mapping, the recommendations in this
section don't apply. You must increase the number of available NAT IP address
and port tuples configured on the NAT gateway or use multiple NAT gateways. Warning: Established connections may be interrupted if you enable or disable
dynamic port allocation, or if you decrease the minimum number of ports per VM.
For more information, see Switch port allocation method
and Reduce ports per VM .
To reduce port usage, complete the following steps:
Disable Endpoint-Independent
Mapping .
Enable dynamic port allocation .
To use dynamic port allocation, you set a minimum number of ports per VM and
a maximum number of ports per VM. Cloud NAT automatically allocates
a number of NAT source IP address and source port tuples between the minimum
and maximum number of ports, inclusive. Using a low number for the minimum
number of ports reduces wasting NAT source IP address and source port tuples
on VMs with fewer active connections. If you encounter connection timeouts
while ports are being allocated, see Reduce packet drops with dynamic port
allocation .
Determine the lowest possible minimum number of ports to meet your needs.
There are several methods to do this, and most rely on reviewing the
number of used ports ( compute.googleapis.com/nat/port_usage ) as input to
the decision-making process. For information about how to find port
usage, see View port
usage .
The following are two example methods to determine a minimum number of ports:
Consider the average value of compute.googleapis.com/nat/port_usage over
a representative time period for a representative number of VMs.
Consider the most frequently occurring value of
compute.googleapis.com/nat/port_usage over a representative time period
for a representative number of VMs.
Determine the lowest possible maximum number of ports to meet your needs.
Once again, review compute.googleapis.com/nat/port_usage as input to your
decision-making process. Consider the maximum value of
compute.googleapis.com/nat/port_usage over a representative time period for
a representative number of VMs as a starting point for the maximum number of
ports. Keep in mind that setting the maximum number too high can prevent
other VMs from receiving NAT source IP address and source port tuples.
Finding the right values for minimum and maximum ports involves
iterative testing. For steps to change minimum and maximum port numbers, see
Change minimum or maximum ports when dynamic port allocation is
configured .
Review the NAT timeouts , their
meanings, and their default values. If you need to rapidly create a series of
TCP connections to the same destination 3-tuple, consider reducing the TCP
time wait so that Cloud NAT can more quickly re-use NAT source IP
address and source port tuples. This allows Cloud NAT to more
quickly use the same 5-tuple instead of needing to use a unique 5-tuple,
which might require allocation of additional NAT source IP address and source
port tuples for each sending VM. For steps to change NAT timeouts, see
Change NAT timeouts .
Frequently asked questions
Regional restriction for Cloud NAT
Can I use the same Cloud NAT gateway in more than one region?
No. A Cloud NAT gateway cannot be associated with more than one
region, VPC network, or Cloud Router.
If you need to provide connectivity for other regions or VPC
networks, create additional Cloud NAT gateways for them.
Are the external NAT IP addresses used by Cloud NAT gateways global or regional?
Cloud NAT gateways use regional external IP addresses as NAT IP
addresses. Even though they are regional, they are publicly routable. For
information about different ways that NAT IP addresses can be allocated or
assigned, see NAT IP addresses .
When Cloud NAT can and cannot be used
Does Cloud NAT apply to instances, including GKE node VMs, that have external IP addresses?
Generally, no. If the network interface of a VM has an external IP
address, Google Cloud always performs 1-to-1 NAT for packets sent
from the primary internal IP address of the network interface without using
Cloud NAT. However, Cloud NAT could still provide
NAT services to packets sent from alias IP address ranges of that same network
interface. For additional details, see Cloud NAT
specifications and Compute Engine
interaction .
Does Public NAT let a source VM whose network interface lacks an external IP address send traffic to a destination VM or load balancer that has an external IP address, even when the source and destination are in the same VPC network?
Yes. The network path involves sending traffic out of the
VPC network through a default internet gateway, and then receiving
it in the same network.
When the source VM sends a packet to the destination, Public NAT
performs source NAT (SNAT) before delivering the packet to the second instance.
Public NAT performs destination NAT (DNAT) for responses from the second
instance to the first. For a step-by-step example, see
Basic Public NAT configuration and workflow .
Can I use Private NAT for communication between VMs in the same VPC network?
No, Private NAT doesn't perform NAT on traffic between VMs in the same
VPC network.
Unsolicited incoming connections not supported
Does Cloud NAT allow for inbound connections (for example, SSH) to instances without external IP addresses?
No, Cloud NAT does not support unsolicited incoming connections.
For more information, see
Cloud NAT specifications .
However, Google Cloud's network edge might respond to pings if the
destination IP address is a Cloud NAT gateway external IP address that
has active port mappings to at least one VM instance. To see IP addresses
assigned to a Cloud NAT gateway, use the
gcloud compute routers get-nat-ip-info command .
External IP addresses marked as IN_USE might respond to pings.
If you need to connect to a VM that doesn't have an external IP address, see
Choose a connection option for internal-only VMs .
For example, as part of the Cloud NAT example Compute Engine
setup ,
you connect to a VM without an external IP address by using Identity-Aware Proxy.
Cloud NAT and ports
Why does a VM have a fixed number of ports ( 64 by default)?
When a Cloud NAT gateway provides NAT for a VM, it
reserves source address and source port tuples according to the port
reservation procedure .
For more information, see port reservation
examples .
Can I change the minimum number of ports reserved for a VM?
Yes. You can increase or decrease the minimum number of ports per
VM when you create a new Cloud NAT gateway or by editing it
later. Each Cloud NAT gateway reserves source address and source
port tuples according to the port reservation
procedure .
For additional information about decreasing the minimum number of
ports, see the next question.
Can I decrease the minimum number of ports per VM after creating the Cloud NAT gateway?
Yes; however, decreasing the minimum number of ports could
result in the port reservation
procedure reserving a
smaller number of ports per VM. When this happens, existing TCP connections
might be reset and, if so, must be re-established.
When switching NAT mapping from Primary and Secondary ranges to Primary range only, are additional ports allocated to each instance immediately released?
No. Any additional ports used by secondary ranges are retained by instances
until the minimum ports per VM setting is reduced. When Cloud NAT is
configured to map Secondary (alias) ranges for subnets, Cloud NAT
assigns a minimum of 1,024 ports per instance, based on the port reservation
procedure .
By switching to Primary ranges only, Cloud NAT conserves those
additional allocated ports for instances that have already had those ports
assigned. After changing the ranges for which Cloud NAT is applied to
Primary only, the actual number of ports assigned to those instances is not
changed until the minimum ports per VM setting is also reduced.
To reduce the amount of ports allocated to those instances, after switching to
primary ranges, the minimum ports per VM setting must be reduced. After that value is
reduced, Cloud NAT automatically adjusts the number of ports
allocated per instance down, which reduces port consumption.
Cloud NAT and other Google services
Does Cloud NAT enable access to Google APIs and services?
When you enable Cloud NAT for a subnet's primary IP
range, Google Cloud automatically enables
Private Google Access . For more
information, see
Private Google Access interaction .
