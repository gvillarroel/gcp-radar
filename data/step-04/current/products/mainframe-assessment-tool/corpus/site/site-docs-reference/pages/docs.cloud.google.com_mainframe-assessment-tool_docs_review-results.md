View and understand assessment results
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to review the assessment of the discovered
assets, and analyze the application source files using generative AI.
The assessment results provide you with details such as the lines of code
and number of calls found in the application, which help you plan your
migration. Also, the analysis provides you with a summary of the program,
which helps you understand the semantics of the program.
Before you begin
Create an assessment
Review application assessment results
To open an assessment to review results, follow these steps:
Open the Mainframe Assessment Tool in a web browser.
In the navigation menu, click Assessments .
On the Assessments page, to open a specific assessment, click
the arrow_forward expander arrow.
The assessment dashboard appears, and it includes the following pages:
Discovery : Discover and analyze source code .
Domains : Get AI-generated insights for your business domains .
Assets : View AI-generated insights for assets .
Discover and analyze source code
The Discovery page provides an overview of analysis of the application
source code that you uploaded for assessment.
To discover and analyze your source code, follow these steps:
Click Discovery .
To select a report type, in the Report type list, select the report type
that you want to view.
The following table lists different report types and their description:
Report type
Description
Details
Inventory
Provides details about the number of files, code lines, and program types, including scheduler configuration files (BMC Control-M).
Count by file type: number of files per language.
Lines of code by file type: number of code lines per file type.
Actual vs commented lines of code: number
of code lines compared to number of comment lines.
Category - batch/online: number of batch programs
compared to online programs.
Total lines of code: total number of lines of code
across all files included in the assessment. Use this data to understand
the overall size of the codebase.
Module Types
Categorizes modules based on their call relationships, specifically
for COBOL and JCL.
Modules called from COBOL programs: number of modules
that are called directly from within the COBOL source code.
Modules called from JCL: number of modules that are
called directly in your JCL files.
Top 5 COBOL module utilities: list of frequently used
utilities used by your COBOL programs.
Top 5 JCL module utilities: list of frequently used
utilities in the JCL jobs.
Complexity
For COBOL programs, shows the complexity of the source code by using
Cyclomatic complexity (McCabe's metric).
McCabe's metrics represent the number of execution paths or decision points
in the source code. This qualitative value helps you identify which
applications might be easier or more complex to modernize.
Complexity table: a file-by-file breakdown of the
calculated complexity metrics such as complexity count. A higher complexity
count suggests a more complex program.
Simple: complexity < 100
Medium: 100 <= complexity < 500
Complex: 500 <= complexity < 1000
Very complex: 1000 <= complexity
Complexity mapping: visual representation of the
complexity table that provides an overview of the complexity in your
codebase.
Call Dependency
Displays the call graph of all uploaded entities.
The size of the icons is related to the number of incoming and outgoing calls.

Shows modules used in the code but not found during input analysis.
Missing from file: the specific source file that contains
a reference to a module or component that couldn't be found within the
uploaded assessment files.
Missing module name: the name of the module or
component that is missing within the uploaded files.
Missing module type: the type of the missing component,
which helps in understanding the nature of the dependency. For example,
DATASET_SCHEMA , COPYBOOK , or PROC .
Use this tab to understand what was missing and consider adding these
modules before re-running the assessment.

shows the connection details between the jobs.
Job dependencies from writers to readers: shows
the writer job, the writer program, the data source, the reader program,
and the reader job.
JCL Substitution Params
Shows the resolved values of the JCL parameters.
Job name: uniquely identifies a specific JCL job, a
set of instructions for the mainframe that executes a batch process.
Step Name: identifies a single execution step within a
JCL job. A job consists of one or more steps; each step typically runs a
specific program or procedure.
Data definition name: shows the name of a data
definition statement in a JCL procedure.
Data set name: identifies the name of a file, or
dataset, as it exists on the mainframe's storage volumes.
Parameter Name: refers to a symbolic parameter that
acts as a variable within a JCL procedure.

Get AI-generated insights for your business domain
The Domains page provides AI-generated insights for the business domains
associated with this assessment. An assessment can have multiple domains, as many
as you specified when creating the assessment. Each domain has its own status,
summary, business logic, data flow, and associated assets. Domains help you
partition portions of your codebase as belonging to a specific business
function.
This feature requires that you enable AI insights and add a business domain when
you create the assessment. If this page is unavailable, create a new assessment,
and enable AI insights.
To get an AI-generated description of your application's business domains,
follow these steps:
Click Domains .
A list of domains is displayed, along with the status of each domain.
To see the summary, business logic, and data flow of a specific domain,
click Show more .
You see detailed AI-generated descriptions of your application's business
domain. These descriptions include the purpose, logic, processing data, data
flow, and data dependencies.
To search for a specific domain, in the Search field, enter the domain
name.
Optional: To view the list of assets associated with this domain, click
View assets .
Domain images
Note: This is an experimental feature.
The Domains page also displays AI-generated images representing your business domains.
Each domain image is generated based on the domain specification to visually represent the
functions and systems described in the domain.
Domain image generation has the following requirements:
Use of the global Vertex AI endpoint.
Supported AI models: Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview and Gemini
3 Flash Preview. Mainframe Assessment Tool uses the Gemini
3 Pro Image Preview for domain image generation.
View AI-generated insights for assets
The Assets page provides a summary, detailed logic, and code suggestions
for a program or job in your mainframe application. You can also view
the status, type, language, and execution mode (batch or online) for each asset.
For scheduler configuration assets, such as BMC Control-M, Mainframe Assessment Tool
provides AI-generated insights that help you visualize the scheduler workflow,
including a listing of scheduled jobs, timelines for daily, weekly, or
monthly schedules, and dependency graphs showing job relationships. This data
is also available in the exported HTML and JSON reports.
The Assets page displays a new entry in the table for each discovered
asset, showing its assessment status.
Pending: asset is waiting its turn for analysis.
In Progress: asset assessment is in progress.
Completed: asset analysis has been completed.
Warning: assessment is complete with a non-blocking warning during code
generation.
To narrow the selection of assets, apply filters in the Filter field.
Select a property name to filter on and enter a property value. For example,
to filter for all assets by their assessment status, set the property name to
Status , and select a value such as Warning or Completed .
