Create and manage datasets
Note : You can customize the Google Neural Machine Translation
(NMT) model using the Cloud Translation - Advanced API. We recommend that you use the Cloud Translation API to create
datasets and models because any future enhancements will apply only to the
Cloud Translation API. If you have existing AutoML resources, you can
upgrade them to work with the Cloud Translation API. For more information, see Upgrade AutoML
resources .
A dataset contains representative samples of the type of content that you want
to translate, as matching segment pairs in the source and target languages. The
dataset serves as the input for training a model.
A project can have multiple datasets; each one can be used to train a separate
model.
Create a dataset
Create a dataset to contain the training data for your model. When you create a
dataset, you specify the source and target languages of your training data. For
more information about the supported languages and variants, see Language
support for custom models .
Web UI
The Cloud Translation console lets you create a new dataset and import items
into it.
Go to the Cloud Translation console.
Go to the
Translation page
In the navigation pane, click Datasets .
On the Datasets page, click Create dataset .
In the Create dataset dialog, specify details about the dataset:
Enter a name for the dataset.
Select the source and target languages from the drop-down lists.
Click Create .
REST
The following example shows how to send a POST request to the
project.locations.datasets/create method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : The region where the dataset will be located, such as
us-central1 .
DATASET_NAME : A name for the dataset.
SOURCE_LANG_CODE : The language
code that specifies the dataset's source language.
TARGET_LANG_CODE : The language
code that specifies the dataset's target language.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets
Request JSON body:
{
"display_name": " DATASET_NAME ",
"source_language_code": " SOURCE_LANG_CODE ",
"target_language_code": " TARGET_LANG_CODE "
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_NAME /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID "
}

Import segments into a dataset
After you have created a dataset, you can import segment pairs into the dataset.
For details on preparing your source data, see
Preparing training data .
For each file, the Google Cloud console lets you tag imported segment pairs with one
or more key-value pairs. Tagging makes it easier to find and filter segments by
source. For example, a key-value pair could be Domain:costmetics or
Year:2020 .
You can add tags when you import segments through the Google Cloud console;
tagging isn't supported by the API. Also, you can't modify tags or add tags to
segments that have already been imported.
Web UI
The following steps import items into an existing dataset.
Go to the Cloud Translation console.
Go to the
Translation page
In the navigation pane, click Datasets .
From the dataset list, click the name of the dataset that want to add
training data to.
Go to the Import tab.
Add files to import segment pairs for model training.
Upload files from your local computer to a Cloud Storage bucket or select
existing files from Cloud Storage.
By default, Cloud Translation automatically splits your data into training,
validation, and test sets. If you want to upload separate files for each
split, select Use separate files for training, validation, and testing
(advanced) . Use this option if your dataset has more than 100,000 segment
pairs to avoid exceeding the maximum 10,000 segment pair limit for the
validation and test sets.
To add tags to segment pairs, expand Tags (optional) .
From the list of files, click edit
Edit to add one or more tags to all segment pairs for a given file.
In the Tags pane, click Add tag .
Enter a key and value. You'll be able to filter segments by this
key-value pair.
To add more tags, click Add tag .
Click Continue when you're done adding tags.
Click Continue to import segment pairs.
After the import is complete, you can view the imported sentence pairs in
the Sentences tab of your dataset. You filter segments by split
(training, validation, or testing) and by one or more tags.
REST
Use the projects.locations.datasets.importData method to
import items into a dataset.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : The region where the dataset will be located, such as
us-central1 .
DATASET_ID : The ID of the dataset to add data to.
FILE_DISPLAY_NAME : The name of the file that contains data to
import.
USAGE : Specifies the data split for these segment pairs
( TRAIN , VALIDATION , or TEST ).
FILE_PATH : The path to the source data file in
Cloud Storage.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID :importData
Request JSON body:
{
"input_config": {
"input_files": [

After you have created and populated the dataset, you can train a model. For
more information, see Creating and managing models ).
Import issues
When you create a dataset, Cloud Translation might drop segment pairs if
they are too long, if segments in the source and target languages are identical
(untranslated), or if there are duplicates (multiple segments with the same
source language text).
For segment pairs that are too long, we recommend that you break up segments
to roughly 200 words or less, and then recreate the dataset. The 200 word limit
is an estimate for the maximum length. While processing your data,
Cloud Translation uses an internal process to tokenize your input data,
which can increase the size of your segments. This tokenized data is what
Cloud Translation uses to measure data size.
For segment pairs that are identical, remove them from your dataset. If you want
to prevent some segments from being translated, use a glossary
resource to build a custom dictionary
instead.
Export data
You can export segment pairs from existing datasets to a Cloud Storage
bucket.
Web UI
Go to the Cloud Translation console.
Go to the
Translation page
In the navigation pane, click Datasets to view a list of your datasets.
Click the name of the dataset for which you want to export data.
On the dataset details page, click Export data .
Select a Cloud Storage destination where the exported TSV files are
saved.
Click Export .
Cloud Translation outputs TSV files that are named according to
their dataset set (train, validation, and test).
REST
Use the projects.locations.datasets.exportData method to
export data to Cloud Storage as TSV files.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : The region where the dataset to export is located,
such as us-central1 .
DATASET_ID : The ID of the dataset to export.
DESTINATION_DIRECTORY : The Cloud Storage path where
the output is sent.
