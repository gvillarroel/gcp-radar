Manage datasets
Manage existing adaptive translation datasets by using the Cloud Translation API.
You can list datasets, list files that are used by a dataset, delete all entries
from a given file, or delete datasets.
List datasets
View a list of all existing adaptive translation datasets in your project.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID : the numeric or alphanumeric ID of
your Google Cloud project
LOCATION : The region where your source dataset is located, such
as us-central1 .
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /adaptiveMtDatasets
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID " \ "https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /adaptiveMtDatasets"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /adaptiveMtDatasets" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"adaptiveMtDatasets": [
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /adaptiveMtDatasets/ DATASET_ID ",
"displayName": " DISPLAY_NAME ",
"sourceLanguageCode": " SOURCE_LANGUAGE ",
