Cloud Translation - Basic API gives you straightforward access to Google's
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model without modified settings. It also supports the standard TLLM model if you specify its full resource name. Cloud Translation - Basic supports only standard models, not customized models.
Cloud Translation - Advanced lets you choose between the default
NMT model, a state-of-the-art
LLM translation model that supports Adaptive Translation, and your
own customized versions of the TLLM or NMT
models.
Use this table to decide on the best model for your use case.
Model
Description
Model ID
Translation LLM (TLLM)
Highest quality translation model - a Large language model (LLM)
powered by Gemini and fine-tuned for translation to provide
the highest quality translations at fast latencies (2x faster latency than
Gemini 2.0 Flash).
general/translation-llm
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model
Fastest translation model - ideal for real time and latency
critical use cases. This is an updated version of Google's original
Neural Machine Translation, available through the Cloud Translation - Basic API using
[v2 client libraries](/translate/docs/reference/libraries/v2/overview-v2).
You can get going quickly using this model out of the box, without any
customization.
general/nmt
Customized
Translation LLM
Provides high quality translation customization via fine-tuning
of the Translation LLM with domain-specific language-pair
training data. It outperforms the NMT customization by offering faster model training
and serving times, as well as more fluent translations.
This is a new feature of Cloud Translation - Advanced.
translation-llm-custom/{model-id}
Adaptive Machine Translation model
This option involves real-time, lightweight customization of the
Translation LLM using
Adaptive Translation
based on a limited dataset of translation examples.
general/translation-llm-adaptive
Customized NMT model
You can train a new customized version of the NMT
model using training data specific to your domain and use case.
The model ID is generated after model training completes.
Note that each model supports its own set of languages. Refer to the
Supported languages guide to ensure that your source and
target languages are supported.
