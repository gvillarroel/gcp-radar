Customizing the NMT model
Cloud Translation - Advanced API lets you customize the Google
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model without
writing code. This means you can tailor a custom model to your domain-specific
content and produce more accurate translations than the default Google
NMT model would.
The NMT model covers a large number
of language pairs and does well with general-purpose text. Where a custom model
excels is in handling specific, niche vocabularies. Customizing the
NMT model lets you get the right translation of
domain-specific terminology that matters to you.
If you run a specialized reporting service that has the
opportunity to expand into new countries. Those markets require that your
time-sensitive content be translated correctly in real time, including
specialized terminology. Instead of having to hire bilingual staff
or contract with specialist translators, both of which come at a high price,
you can create and refine a custom model to do the job in real time at a
much lower cost.
Note : You can customize the Google Neural Machine Translation
(NMT) model using the Cloud Translation - Advanced API. We recommend that you use the Cloud Translation API to create
datasets and models because any future enhancements will apply only to the
Cloud Translation API. If you have existing AutoML resources, you can
upgrade them to work with the Cloud Translation API. For more information, see Upgrade AutoML
resources .
Data Preparation
In order to train a custom model, you supply matching pairs of segments
in the source and target languages. These are pairs of words or phrases that
mean the same thing in the language you want to translate from
and the language you want to translate to. The closer in meaning your segment
pairs are, the better your model can work.
While putting together the dataset of matching segment pairs, start with the
use case:
What outcome are you trying to achieve?
What kinds of segments are important to translate correctly in order to
achieve that outcome? Can the NMT model achieve that
out of the box?
Is it possible for humans to translate these key segments in a way that
satisfies you? If the translation task is ambiguous enough that a person
fluent in both languages would have a hard time doing a satisfactory job,
the NMT model might perform as well as a custom model.
What kinds of examples best reflect the type and range of segment pairs
that your system will need to translate?
Match data to your problem domain
You're training a custom translation model because you need a model that fits
a particular linguistic domain. Make sure your segment pairs do the best
possible job of covering the vocabulary, usage, and grammatical quirks of your
industry or area of focus. Find documents that contain typical usages you'd find
in the translation tasks you want accomplished, and make sure your parallel
phrases match as closely in meaning as you can arrange. Of course, sometimes
languages don't map perfectly in vocabulary or syntax, but try to capture the
full diversity of semantics you expect to encounter in use if that's possible.
You're building on top of a model that already does a pretty good job with
general-purpose translation - your examples are the special last step that makes
custom models work for your use case in particular, so make sure
they're relevant and representative of usage you expect to see.
Capture the diversity of your linguistic space
It's tempting to assume that the way people write about a specific domain is
uniform enough that a small number of text samples translated by a small
number of translators should be sufficient to train a model that works well for
anyone else writing about that domain. But we're all individuals, and we each
bring our own personality to the words we write. A training dataset with segment
pairs from a broad selection of authors and translators is more likely to give
you a model that's useful for translating writing from a diverse organization.
In addition, consider the variety of segment lengths and structures; a dataset
where all the segments are the same size or share a similar grammatical
structure won't produce build a good custom model that captures all the
possibilities.
Source your data
After you've established what data you need, you need to find a way to source
it. You can begin by taking into account all the data your organization
collects. You might find that you're already collecting the data you would need
to train a translation model. In case you don't have the data you need, you can
obtain it manually or outsource it to a third-party provider.
Keep humans in the loop
If it's at all feasible, make sure a person who understands both languages well
has validated that the segment pairs match up correctly and represent
understandable, accurate translations. A common mistake like misaligning the
rows of your training data spreadsheet can yield translations that sound like
nonsense. High-quality data is the most important thing you can provide to
Cloud Translation - Advanced API to get a model that's usable for your business.
Keep in mind fairness in developing segment pairs
A core principle underpinning Google's ML products is human-centered machine
learning, an approach that promotes
responsible AI practices ,
including fairness. The goal of fairness in ML is to understand and prevent
unjust or prejudicial treatment of people related to race, income, sexual
orientation, religion, gender, and other characteristics historically
associated with discrimination and marginalization, when and where they
manifest in algorithmic systems or algorithmically aided decision-making.

notes:
Tip: Be Fair-aware!
Review regulations in both your region and the locations your application
will serve, as well as existing research or product information in your
domain to learn about legal guidelines and possible cultural issues.

If you have scarce data about a particular subgroup, make sure that data is
spread representatively between your training and test sets by performing
the train-test split yourself.
When testing, think carefully about your problem domain and its potential
for unfairness and bias. Come up with cases that would adversely impact
your users if they were found in production, and test those first.

Clean up messy data
You may make mistakes when preprocessing data, and some mistakes can really
confuse a custom model. In particular, look for the following data
issues that you can fix:
Remove duplicate source segments, particularly if they have different target
translations. Cloud Translation - Advanced API uses only the first seen example and
drops all other pairs at import time. By removing duplicates, you ensure
that Cloud Translation - Advanced API uses your preferred translation.
Align source segments to the correct target segments.
Match segments to the specified language; for example, include only Chinese
segments in a Chinese dataset.
For target segments that include mixed languages, check that untranslated
words are intentionally untranslated, such as names of products or
organizations. Target segments that mistakenly include untranslated words add
noise to your training data, which can result in a lower quality model.
Fix segments with typographical or grammatical errors so that your model
doesn't learn these errors.
Remove non-translatable content such as placeholder tags and HTML tags.
Non-translatable content can result in punctuation errors.
Don't include segment pairs that replace general entities with specific nouns.
For example, avoid an example that translates a general term like president
to the name of a specific president like JFK .
That could teach the model to change all instances of president to JFK .
Instead, remove these segment pairs or change the specific nouns to
general ones.
Remove duplicate segments in the training and test sets (see
Dataset division about splitting your dataset into three
subsets).
Split multiple segments into different segment pairs. Training on a dataset
where many items have more than about 50 tokens (words) in them yields lower
quality models. Split items into individual sentences where possible.
Use consistent casing. Casing affects how a model learns, for example, to
distinguish a headline versus body text.
Remove TMX tags when importing data from a TSV file. In some cases, you
might export your existing translation memory to a TSV file, which might
include TMX tags. However, Cloud Translation - Advanced API cleans up translation
unit tags only when you import from a TMX file (not for TSV files).
Data processing
Cloud Translation - Advanced API stops parsing your data input file when:
There is invalid formatting.
There is an unreasonably long segment pair (10 MB).
The file uses an encoding other than UTF-8.
Cloud Translation - Advanced API ignores errors for problems it cannot detect, such
as:
A <tu> element in a TMX file that doesn't specify the source or target
language.
One of the input segment pairs is empty.
For automatic data splitting, Cloud Translation - Advanced API performs additional
processing (see Dataset division ):
After the dataset is uploaded, it removes segment pairs with identical
source segments.
It randomly splits your data into three sets with a ratio of 8:1:1
(train:validation:test) before training.
Dataset division
Your dataset of segment pairs is divided into three subsets, for training,
validation and testing:
Training Set
Most of your data should be in the training set. This is the data
your model "sees" during training: it's used to learn the parameters of the
model and calculate the weights of the connections between nodes of the
neural network.
Validation Set
The validation set, sometimes called the dev set, is also used during the
training process. During model learning, the framework uses the training set to
train a suite of candidate models, and then uses the model's performance on the
validation set to choose the best model generated. It uses the model's
performance on the validation set to tune the model's hyperparameters, which are
variables that specify the model's structure. If you used the training set to
tune the hyperparameters, the model would end up overly focused on your training
data. Using a somewhat novel dataset to fine-tune model structure means your
model will generalize better.
Test Set
The test set is not involved in the training process at all. After the
model has completed its training entirely, the test set is used as an
entirely new challenge for your model. The performance of your model on
the test set is intended to give you a pretty good idea of how your model
will perform on real-world data.
If you don't manually specify how your dataset is split between these functions
as described in Preparing your training data , and if your
dataset contains fewer than 100,000 segment pairs, then
Cloud Translation - Advanced API automatically uses 80% of your content documents
for training, 10% for validating, and 10% for testing. If your data is larger
than that, you must explicitly specify how it is split. Manual splitting gives
you more control over the process, not only letting you determine the split
percentages, but also letting you specify particular sets in which to include
particular segment pairs.
Importing data
After you've decided whether a manual or automatic split of your data is
right for you, there are two ways to add data:
You can import data as a tab-separated values (TSV) file containing source
and target segments, one segment pair per line.
You can import data as a
TMX file , a standard
format for providing segment pairs to automatic translation model tools
(see Prepare training data ) for more about the
TMX format). If a TMX file contains invalid XML tags,
Cloud Translation - Advanced API ignores them. If the TMX file contains XML or
TMX errors, like if an end tag or <tmx> element is missing, Cloud Translation - Advanced API ends processing and
returns an error if it skips more than 1024 invalid ` ' elements.
Preliminary evaluation of your custom model
After your model is trained, you receive a summary of your model performance.
Click the Train tab to view a detailed analysis.
The BLEU score of your custom model and of the standard Google
NMT model are shown in the Train tab, along with
the BLEU score performance gain from using the custom mode.
The higher the BLEU score, the better translations your model can give
you for segments that are similar to your training data.
Scores in the range 30-40 are considered good. For a detailed explanation
of BLEU scores, see
The BLEU translation quality metric BLEU .
There are other evaluation metrics that are often more reliable than the
BLEU score. For information about those evaluation options, see
Evaluate translation models .
Debugging
Debugging a custom model is more about debugging the data than the model
itself. If your model is not translating the way you intend, check your data
to see where it can be improved.
Testing
Even if your BLEU score looks okay, it's a good practice to check the model
yourself to make sure its performance matches your expectations. If your
training and test data are drawn from the same incorrect set of samples, the
scores might be excellent even if the translation is nonsense. Add some examples
as input on the Predict tab and compare the results from the custom model
with the Google NMT base model. You might notice that your
model comes up with the same predictions as the base model, especially on short
segments or if you have a smaller training set, since the base model is already
pretty good for a wide variety of use cases. In that case, try longer or more
complex segments. However, if all of your segments come back identical to the
predictions from the base model, it might indicate a data problem.
If there's a mistake that you're particularly worried about your model making
(like a translation mistake that might be costly in money or reputation) make sure your test set or procedure covers that case
adequately for you to feel safe using your model in everyday tasks.
