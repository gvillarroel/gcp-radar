Data collaborators
Workload author
Workload operator
In this guide, Alex and Bola want to find out who has the highest salary without
revealing numbers to each other. They decide to use Confidential Space to keep
their data confidential, and agree to take on the following
roles :
Alex: Data collaborator, workload author
Bola: Data collaborator, workload operator
This arrangement is designed to keep things as straightforward as possible for
this guide. However, it's possible for the workload author and operator to be
entirely independent from the data collaborators, and you can have as many
collaborators as you want.
Before you begin
This guide demonstrates a Confidential Space scenario using a single account in a
single organization with access to multiple projects, so you can experience the
whole process. In a production deployment, collaborators, workload authors, and
workload operators have separate accounts and their own projects contained in
discrete organizations, inaccessible to each other and keeping their
confidential data separate.
Confidential Space can interact with many of Google Cloud's services to produce its
results, including but not limited to:
Artifact Registry
Cloud Storage
Cloud Key Management Service
Compute Engine
Cloud Logging
Service accounts
Workload Identity Federation
This guide makes use of and assumes a basic understanding of all of these
features.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to complete this guide,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the project:
Cloud KMS Admin ( roles/cloudkms.admin ) for the data collaborators (Alex and Bola).
IAM Workload Identity Pool Admin ( roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolAdmin ) for the data collaborators (Alex and Bola).
Service Usage Admin ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ) for the data collaborators (Alex and Bola).
Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin ) for the data collaborators (Alex and Bola) and the workload operator (Bola).
Service Account Admin ( roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin ) for the workload operator (Bola).
Compute Admin ( roles/compute.admin ) for the workload operator (Bola).
Security Admin ( roles/securityAdmin ) for the workload operator (Bola).
Artifact Registry Administrator ( roles/artifactregistry.admin ) for the workload author (Alex).
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Set up data collaborator resources
Both Alex and Bola need independent projects that contain the following
resources:
The confidential data itself.
An encryption key to encrypt that data and keep it confidential.
A Cloud Storage bucket to store the encrypted data in.
A workload identity pool . The
workload processing the confidential data uses the pool to access the private
data and decrypt it.
To get started, go to the Google Cloud console:
Go to Google Cloud console
Set up Alex's resources
To set up the resources for Alex, complete the following
instructions.
Click terminal
Activate Cloud Shell .
In Cloud Shell, enter the following command to create a project
for Alex, replacing
ALEX_PROJECT_ID with a name of your
choice:
gcloud projects create ALEX_PROJECT_ID
Switch to the newly created project:
gcloud config set project ALEX_PROJECT_ID
Enable the APIs that Alex requires as a data
collaborator and workload author:
gcloud services enable \
artifactregistry . googleapis . com \
cloudkms . googleapis . com \
iamcredentials . googleapis . com
Create a key ring and encryption key with Cloud Key Management Service:
gcloud kms keyrings create ALEX_KEYRING_NAME \
--location=global
gcloud kms keys create ALEX_KEY_NAME \
--location=global \
--keyring= ALEX_KEYRING_NAME \
--purpose=encryption
Grant Alex the
cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypter role so they can use the newly
created encryption key to encrypt data:
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding \
"projects/ ALEX_PROJECT_ID /locations/global/\
keyRings/ ALEX_KEYRING_NAME /\
cryptoKeys/ ALEX_KEY_NAME " \
--member=user:$(gcloud config get-value account) \
--role=roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypter
Create Alex's workload identity pool:
gcloud iam workload - identity - pools create ALEX_POOL_NAME \
-- location = global
Create a Cloud Storage bucket for the input data, and another to
store the results in:
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// ALEX_INPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
gs:// ALEX_OUTPUT_BUCKET_NAME
Create a file that contains only Alex's salary as a
number:
echo 123456 > ALEX_SALARY .txt
Encrypt the file, and then upload it to Alex's
bucket:
gcloud kms encrypt \
--ciphertext-file=" ALEX_ENCRYPTED_SALARY_FILE " \
--plaintext-file=" ALEX_SALARY .txt" \
--key="projects/ ALEX_PROJECT_ID /locations/global/\
keyRings/ ALEX_KEYRING_NAME /\
cryptoKeys/ ALEX_KEY_NAME "
gcloud storage cp ALEX_ENCRYPTED_SALARY_FILE gs:// ALEX_INPUT_BUCKET_NAME
Set up Bola's resources
To set up the resources for Bola, complete the following
instructions.
In Cloud Shell, enter the following command to create a project
for Bola, replacing
BOLA_PROJECT_ID with a name of your
choice:
gcloud projects create BOLA_PROJECT_ID
Switch to the newly created project:
gcloud config set project BOLA_PROJECT_ID
Enable the APIs that Bola requires as a data
collaborator and workload operator:
gcloud services enable \
cloudkms.googleapis.com \
compute.googleapis.com \
confidentialcomputing.googleapis.com \
iamcredentials.googleapis.com
Create a key ring and encryption key with Cloud Key Management Service:
gcloud kms keyrings create BOLA_KEYRING_NAME \
--location=global
gcloud kms keys create BOLA_KEY_NAME \
--location=global \
--keyring= BOLA_KEYRING_NAME \
--purpose=encryption
Grant Bola the
cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypter role so they can use the newly
created encryption key to encrypt data:
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding \
"projects/ BOLA_PROJECT_ID /locations/global/\
keyRings/ BOLA_KEYRING_NAME /\
cryptoKeys/ BOLA_KEY_NAME " \
--member=user:$(gcloud config get-value account) \
--role=roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypter
Create Bola's workload identity pool:
gcloud iam workload - identity - pools create BOLA_POOL_NAME \
-- location = global
Create a Cloud Storage bucket for the input data, and another to
store the results in:
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BOLA_INPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
gs:// BOLA_OUTPUT_BUCKET_NAME
Create a file that contains only Bola's salary as a
number:
echo 111111 > BOLA_SALARY .txt
Encrypt the file, and then upload it to Bola's
bucket:
gcloud kms encrypt \
--ciphertext-file=" BOLA_ENCRYPTED_SALARY_FILE " \
--plaintext-file=" BOLA_SALARY .txt" \
--key="projects/ BOLA_PROJECT_ID /locations/global/\
keyRings/ BOLA_KEYRING_NAME /\
cryptoKeys/ BOLA_KEY_NAME "
gcloud storage cp BOLA_ENCRYPTED_SALARY_FILE gs:// BOLA_INPUT_BUCKET_NAME
Create a service account for the workload
In this guide, Bola operates and runs the workload, but anyone can take on these
roles, including a third party. The VM instance Bola creates to run the workload
has a service account attached, which has permission to generate attestation
tokens, write logs, read Alex and Bola's encrypted data, and write results to
specific Cloud Storage buckets.
Complete the following steps in Bola's project to set up the service account:
Create a service account to run the workload:
gcloud iam service-accounts create WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
Grant Bola the iam.serviceAccountUser role, so they can attach the service
account to the workload VM later:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member = user: $( gcloud config get-value account ) \
--role = roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
Grant the service account the
confidentialcomputing.workloadUser role so it can generate an attestation
token:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding BOLA_PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/confidentialcomputing.workloadUser
Grant the service account the logging.logWriter role to write logs to
Cloud Logging, so you can check the progress of the workload:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding BOLA_PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/logging.logWriter
Give the service account read access to both Alex and Bola's buckets that
contain their encrypted data, and write access to each of their results
buckets:
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// ALEX_INPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
--member = serviceAccount: WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/storage.objectViewer
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// ALEX_OUTPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
--member = serviceAccount: WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/storage.objectAdmin
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// BOLA_INPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
--member = serviceAccount: WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/storage.objectViewer
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// BOLA_OUTPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
--member = serviceAccount: WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/storage.objectAdmin
This assumes the user granting the access has the Storage Admin
( roles/storage.admin ) role for the project that contains the
Cloud Storage bucket that's being operated on.
Create the workload
In this guide, Alex provides the code for the workload and builds a Docker image
to contain it, but anyone can take on these roles, including a third party.
Alex needs to create the following resources for the workload:
The code that performs the workload.
A Docker repository in Artifact Registry, that the service account running the
workload has access to.
A Docker image that contains and runs the workload code.
To create and set up the resources, complete the following steps in Alex's
project:
Switch to Alex's project:
gcloud config set project ALEX_PROJECT_ID
Click Open editor to open the Cloud Shell Editor, and then create a
new file called salary.go . Copy the following code into the file, and then
save it:

Create a file named Dockerfile in Cloud Shell Editor containing the
following contents:
# Compile the provided Go code to a statically linked binary
FROM golang:latest AS build
WORKDIR /build
COPY salary.go .
RUN go mod init salary
RUN go get cloud.google.com/go/kms/apiv1 cloud.google.com/go/storage google.golang.org/api/option google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/cloud/kms/v1
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath
# Build the workload container image
FROM alpine:latest AS run
WORKDIR /test
COPY --from=build /build/salary /test/salary
ENTRYPOINT ["/test/salary"]
CMD []
# Allow the workload to access the following environment variables
LABEL "tee.launch_policy.allow_env_override"="\
COLLAB_1_NAME,\
COLLAB_2_NAME,\
COLLAB_1_ENCRYPTED_SALARY,\
COLLAB_2_ENCRYPTED_SALARY,\
COLLAB_1_INPUT_BUCKET,\
COLLAB_2_INPUT_BUCKET,\

COLLAB_2_PROJECT_ID,\
COLLAB_1_PROJECT_NUMBER,\
COLLAB_2_PROJECT_NUMBER,\
COLLAB_1_POOL_NAME,\
COLLAB_2_POOL_NAME"
This Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build to first compile the Go code, and
then copies the compiled version of that code to the final workload
container. It also
allows specific environment variables
to be used in that workload container. Values for these environment
variables are mapped later to the specific resources that the workload needs
to operate on.
Click Open Terminal to switch back to Cloud Shell, or invoke the
terminal built into Cloud Shell Editor from the View menu.
Create a Docker repository in Artifact Registry:
gcloud artifacts repositories create REPOSITORY_NAME \
--repository-format = docker \
--location = us
Grant the service account that's going to run the workload the Artifact
Registry Reader ( roles/artifactregistry.reader ) role so it can read from
the repository:
gcloud artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding REPOSITORY_NAME \
--location = us \
--member = serviceAccount: WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/artifactregistry.reader
Update your Docker credentials to include the us-docker.pkg.dev domain
name:
gcloud auth configure-docker us-docker.pkg.dev
Create a Docker image from Dockerfile by entering the following command in
the terminal:
docker build -t \
"us-docker.pkg.dev/ ALEX_PROJECT_ID /\
REPOSITORY_NAME / WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_NAME :latest" .
Push the Docker image to Artifact Registry:
docker push \
us-docker.pkg.dev/ ALEX_PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_NAME
The Docker push response lists the image's SHA256 digest, which is needed
later to authorize the workload. The digest looks similar to the following
example:
sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
Copy the image digest (including the sha256: prefix) somewhere you can
reference it. You can also enter the digest in the following code sample to
prefill the rest of the code samples in this guide that need the value:
WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_IMAGE_DIGEST
Make sure all parties audit the Docker image and verify that it's
trustworthy before authorizing its use.
Authorize the workload
With the workload approved by both parties, Alex and Bola need to add
Google Cloud Attestation as a
provider to their workload
identity pools. The provider specifies the attestation service to use, and the
properties the workload must match for it to be allowed to operate on
Alex's or Bola's data. If a malicious actor changes the Docker image, or alters
another measured property, the workload is denied access.
This guide uses
attribute mappings
to provide direct resource access to the workload based on the image digest.
However, for other situations you may prefer to use service account
impersonation to access the resources. See
External workload access
to learn more.
To set up the providers for Alex and Bola with the required conditions, complete
the following steps:
Enter the following command to create the provider for Alex:
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc attestation-verifier \
--location = global \
--workload-identity-pool = ALEX_POOL_NAME \
--issuer-uri = "https://confidentialcomputing.googleapis.com/" \
--allowed-audiences = "https://sts.googleapis.com" \
--attribute-mapping = "google.subject=\"gcpcs\
::\"+assertion.submods.container.image_digest+\"\
::\"+assertion.submods.gce.project_number+\"\
::\"+assertion.submods.gce.instance_id,\
attribute.image_digest=assertion.submods.container.image_digest" \
--attribute-condition = "assertion.swname == 'CONFIDENTIAL_SPACE'"
Get Alex's project number for the next command:
gcloud projects describe ALEX_PROJECT_ID --format = "value(projectNumber)"
Grant the federated identity defined by Alex's provider the
cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter role, specifying the image_digest attribute
so only workload containers with the specified digest can decrypt their KMS
keys:
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding \
"projects/ ALEX_PROJECT_ID /locations/global/\
keyRings/ ALEX_KEYRING_NAME /\
cryptoKeys/ ALEX_KEY_NAME " \
--member = "principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/\
projects/ ALEX_PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/\
workloadIdentityPools/ ALEX_POOL_NAME /\
attribute.image_digest/ WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_IMAGE_DIGEST " \
--role = roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter
Switch to Bola's project:
gcloud config set project BOLA_PROJECT_ID
Enter the following command to create the provider for Bola:
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc attestation-verifier \
--location = global \
--workload-identity-pool = BOLA_POOL_NAME \
--issuer-uri = "https://confidentialcomputing.googleapis.com/" \
--allowed-audiences = "https://sts.googleapis.com" \
--attribute-mapping = "google.subject=\"gcpcs\
::\"+assertion.submods.container.image_digest+\"\
::\"+assertion.submods.gce.project_number+\"\
::\"+assertion.submods.gce.instance_id,\
attribute.image_digest=assertion.submods.container.image_digest" \
--attribute-condition = "assertion.swname == 'CONFIDENTIAL_SPACE'"
Get Bola's project number for the next command:
gcloud projects describe BOLA_PROJECT_ID --format = "value(projectNumber)"
Grant the federated identity defined by Bola's provider the
cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter role, specifying the image_digest attribute
so only workload containers with the specified digest can decrypt their
KMS keys:
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding \
"projects/ BOLA_PROJECT_ID /locations/global/\
keyRings/ BOLA_KEYRING_NAME /\
cryptoKeys/ BOLA_KEY_NAME " \
--member = "principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/\
projects/ BOLA_PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/\
workloadIdentityPools/ BOLA_POOL_NAME /\
attribute.image_digest/ WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_IMAGE_DIGEST " \
--role = roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter
Test the workload
With providers added to both Alex and Bola's workload identity pools and the
required resources in place, it's time for the workload operator to test the
workload.
To test the workload, you create a new Confidential VM instance in Bola's project
that has the following properties:
A
supported configuration with
AMD SEV, Intel TDX, or Intel TDX with NVIDIA Confidential Computing ( Preview ).
Secure Boot enabled.
An OS based on the
Confidential Space debug image ,
to make troubleshooting easier.
A reference to
the Docker image that Alex created earlier . This is
loaded on top of the Confidential Space image.
An attached
service account that Bola created earlier ,
that runs the workload.
STDOUT and STDERR redirected to both Cloud Logging and the serial
console.
The resource details the workload needs set as environment variables.
Enter the following command in Bola's Cloud Shell to test the workload:
gcloud compute instances create WORKLOAD_VM_2_NAME \
--confidential-compute-type = SEV \
--shielded-secure-boot \
--scopes = cloud-platform \
--zone = us-west1-b \
--maintenance-policy = MIGRATE \
--min-cpu-platform = "AMD Milan" \
--image-project = confidential-space-images \
--image-family = confidential-space-debug \
--service-account = WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \

Note: For more sensitive data or to make managing environment variables easier,
instead of using ~tee-env- as part of the VM instance metadata you can store
the needed values somewhere like
Secret Manager .
View progress
You can view the progress of the workload in Bola's project by going to
Logs explorer .
Go to Logs explorer
To only show Confidential Space log entries, filter by the following
Log fields , if they're available:
Resource type: VM Instance
Instance ID: The instance ID of the VM
Log name: confidential-space-launcher
To refresh the log, click keyboard_tab
Jump to now . You can also scroll to earlier results, and then scroll to the
end of the log again to load the latest entries.
View the results
If the workload task ends and returns 0 , this means no errors have occurred
and it's time to check the output in Alex's and Bola's output buckets:
Switch to Alex's project:
gcloud config set project ALEX_PROJECT_ID
List all the files in their results bucket:
gcloud storage ls gs:// ALEX_OUTPUT_BUCKET_NAME
Read the latest file that is listed, replacing
ALEX_OUTPUT_CLOUD_STORAGE_PATH
with the path of the file, including the gs:// :
gcloud storage cat ALEX_OUTPUT_CLOUD_STORAGE_PATH
If no file is present, then you need to debug your workload .
Switch to Bola's project:
gcloud config set project BOLA_PROJECT_ID
List all the files in their results bucket:
gcloud storage ls gs:// BOLA_OUTPUT_BUCKET_NAME
Read the latest file that is listed, replacing
BOLA_RESULTS_CLOUD_STORAGE_PATH
with the path of the file, including the gs:// :
gcloud storage cat BOLA_RESULTS_CLOUD_STORAGE_PATH
If no file is present, then you need to debug your workload .
After you've successfully read the results, stop the VM instance:
gcloud compute instances stop WORKLOAD_VM_2_NAME --zone = us-west1-b
By reading the files, Alex and Bola each discover who earns more without ever
revealing their salaries to each other.
Debug and restart the workload
A Confidential Space environment has many parts, and it's possible that something
has been configured incorrectly that causes the workload to fail.
Unlike the production Confidential Space image, the debug image keeps the VM
instance running after the workload has finished. This means that, if the logs
don't reveal enough to solve your problem, the next step is to connect to your
VM instance over SSH and
continue debugging .
After you've finished debugging, stop the VM instance:
gcloud compute instances stop WORKLOAD_VM_2_NAME --zone = us-west1-b
To run the workload against the debugged environment, start the VM again:
gcloud compute instances start WORKLOAD_VM_2_NAME --zone = us-west1-b
Harden the environment for production
After you've successfully tested the workload , it's time to
harden the Confidential Space environment for production deployment. Alex and Bola
need to add a
support_attributes assertion
to their providers to verify that the production Confidential Space image is used
for the workload:
Switch to Alex's project:
gcloud config set project ALEX_PROJECT_ID
Enter the following command to update the provider for Alex:
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers update-oidc attestation-verifier \
--location = global \
--workload-identity-pool = ALEX_POOL_NAME \
--issuer-uri = "https://confidentialcomputing.googleapis.com/" \
--allowed-audiences = "https://sts.googleapis.com" \
--attribute-mapping = "google.subject=\"gcpcs\
::\"+assertion.submods.container.image_digest+\"\
::\"+assertion.submods.gce.project_number+\"\
::\"+assertion.submods.gce.instance_id,\
attribute.image_digest=assertion.submods.container.image_digest" \
--attribute-condition = "assertion.swname == 'CONFIDENTIAL_SPACE' \
&& 'STABLE' in assertion.submods.confidential_space.support_attributes "
Switch to Bola's project:
gcloud config set project BOLA_PROJECT_ID
Enter the following command to update the provider for Bola:
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers update-oidc attestation-verifier \
--location = global \
--workload-identity-pool = BOLA_POOL_NAME \
--issuer-uri = "https://confidentialcomputing.googleapis.com/" \
--allowed-audiences = "https://sts.googleapis.com" \
--attribute-mapping = "google.subject=\"gcpcs\
::\"+assertion.submods.container.image_digest+\"\
::\"+assertion.submods.gce.project_number+\"\
::\"+assertion.submods.gce.instance_id,\
attribute.image_digest=assertion.submods.container.image_digest" \
--attribute-condition = "assertion.swname == 'CONFIDENTIAL_SPACE' \
&& 'STABLE' in assertion.submods.confidential_space.support_attributes "
Deploy the production workload
Bola needs to create a separate VM instance to run the production workload. The
following things are different compared to the test workload :
The OS is based on the production Confidential Space image. This has SSH
disabled, and the VM instance stops after the workload finishes.
Logging redirection is removed. Only basic logs that expose no sensitive
information are shown in Cloud Logging.
Enter the following command in Bola's Cloud Shell to deploy the production
workload:
gcloud compute instances create WORKLOAD_VM_NAME \
--confidential-compute-type = SEV \
--shielded-secure-boot \
--scopes = cloud-platform \
--zone = us-west1-b \
--maintenance-policy = MIGRATE \
--image-project = confidential-space-images \
--image-family = confidential-space \
--service-account = WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ BOLA_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--metadata = "^~^tee-image-reference=us-docker.pkg.dev/\
ALEX_PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_NAME :latest\
~tee-env-COLLAB_1_NAME=Alex\
~tee-env-COLLAB_2_NAME=Bola\
~tee-env-COLLAB_1_ENCRYPTED_SALARY= ALEX_ENCRYPTED_SALARY_FILE \
~tee-env-COLLAB_2_ENCRYPTED_SALARY= BOLA_ENCRYPTED_SALARY_FILE \
~tee-env-COLLAB_1_INPUT_BUCKET= ALEX_INPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
~tee-env-COLLAB_2_INPUT_BUCKET= BOLA_INPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
~tee-env-COLLAB_1_OUTPUT_BUCKET= ALEX_OUTPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
~tee-env-COLLAB_2_OUTPUT_BUCKET= BOLA_OUTPUT_BUCKET_NAME \
~tee-env-COLLAB_1_KEYRING_NAME= ALEX_KEYRING_NAME \
~tee-env-COLLAB_2_KEYRING_NAME= BOLA_KEYRING_NAME \
~tee-env-COLLAB_1_KEY_NAME= ALEX_KEY_NAME \
~tee-env-COLLAB_2_KEY_NAME= BOLA_KEY_NAME \
~tee-env-COLLAB_1_PROJECT_ID= ALEX_PROJECT_ID \
~tee-env-COLLAB_2_PROJECT_ID= BOLA_PROJECT_ID \
~tee-env-COLLAB_1_PROJECT_NUMBER= ALEX_PROJECT_NUMBER \
~tee-env-COLLAB_2_PROJECT_NUMBER= BOLA_PROJECT_NUMBER \
~tee-env-COLLAB_1_POOL_NAME= ALEX_POOL_NAME \
~tee-env-COLLAB_2_POOL_NAME= BOLA_POOL_NAME "
The way that you view progress and
view the results is the same as when you tested the workload.
When the production workload is finished, the VM instance stops. To see
different results, you can change the salaries, re-encrypt them, reupload them
to the respective Cloud Storage buckets, and then restart the VM
instance to run the workload again:
gcloud compute instances start WORKLOAD_VM_NAME --zone = us-west1-b
