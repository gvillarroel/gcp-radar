Workload operator
A workload operator can pass options to a Confidential Space workload VM instance
to determine its behavior before it runs. While some flags have required values
that don't change, you still need to make the following choices:
Whether to base the VM instance on a
production or debug Confidential Space image .
Whether to use AMD SEV, Intel TDX, or Intel TDX with NVIDIA Confidential Computing
( Preview ) to help keep your workload data private.
What VM metadata variables need to be passed, which
include details like which workload container image to run, whether to log to
Cloud Logging, and what environment variables to set.
What service account to attach to the VM to run the
workload, and what permissions it needs to access confidential data in other
projects and write the results somewhere.
What zone the VM instance should run in.
Here's an example that creates a Confidential VM, and runs a Docker container
called WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_NAME :
CPU-based workloads
gcloud compute instances create INSTANCE_NAME \
--confidential-compute-type = CONFIDENTIAL_COMPUTING_TECHNOLOGY \
--machine-type = MACHINE_TYPE_NAME \
--maintenance-policy = MAINTENANCE_POLICY \
--shielded-secure-boot \
--image-project = confidential-space-images \
--image-family = IMAGE_FAMILY \
--metadata = "^~^tee-image-reference=us-docker.pkg.dev/ WORKLOAD_AUTHOR_PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_NAME :latest" \
--service-account = WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ WORKLOAD_OPERATOR_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--scopes = cloud-platform \
--zone = ZONE_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Provide the following values:
INSTANCE_NAME : The name of the new VM instance.
CONFIDENTIAL_COMPUTING_TECHNOLOGY :
The type of
Confidential Computing technology
to use. Choose one of the following values:
SEV
TDX
MACHINE_TYPE_NAME : The VM machine type, for example,
n2d-standard-2 . Valid machine types for Confidential VM instances are
determined by the Confidential Computing technology you've chosen, either
AMD SEV or Intel TDX. See
Machine types, CPUs, and zones .
MAINTENANCE_POLICY : For N2D machine types that use SEV,
set this to MIGRATE for live migration support. For all other machine
types, set this value to TERMINATE , as they
don't support live migration .
IMAGE_FAMILY_NAME : The family for the
Confidential Space images .
Choose one of the following:
confidential-space for production workloads
confidential-space-debug for debug workloads
WORKLOAD_AUTHOR_PROJECT : The ID of the project that
hosts the Artifact Registry repository that the workload container is stored in.
REPOSITORY_NAME : The Artifact Registry repository name that
the workload container is stored in.
WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_NAME : The name of the workload
container.
WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : The name of the
service account that runs the workload.
WORKLOAD_OPERATOR_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project
that runs the workload.
ZONE_NAME : The zone that the VM instance runs in, for
example, us-west1-b . Confidential Space requires the following services,
which are available in specific locations:
Confidential VM ,
based on the Confidential Computing technology in use
Certificate Authority Service
PROJECT_ID : Optional. The ID of the project to create
the VM instance in.
GPU-based workloads
Preview
This product is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Before you begin
Confidential Space only supports NVIDIA Confidential Computing ( Preview ) on H100 GPUs.
To make sure that you have sufficient GPU quota for the resources you're
requesting, check your GPU quota . For
Confidential VM instances with GPUs, request preemptible GPU quota to use the
resources. When you request GPU quota, you must request quota for the GPU
models that you want to create in each region, and additional global quota
( GPUs (all regions) ) for the total number of GPUs of all types in all
regions.
To understand quota consumption, read
GPU VMs and preemptible allocation quotas .
Read the
limitations
for creating a resize request in a MIG.
To install the drivers required for NVIDIA Confidential Computing ( Preview ), you
must pass the metadata variable
tee-install-gpu-driver with a value of true .
For NVIDIA drivers and the CUDA toolkit, a VM boot disk with 30GB or more
space is recommended.
Deploy a GPU-based workload
To deploy a GPU-based workload, you must create a Confidential VM instance
using the spot or
flex-start
( Preview ) provisioning model.

To use the flex-start ( Preview ) provisioning model, create an
instance template, followed by a
managed instance group
(MIG).
Create an instance template:
gcloud beta compute instance-templates create INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME \
--provisioning-model = FLEX_START \
--confidential-compute-type = TDX \
--machine-type = a3-highgpu-1g \
--maintenance-policy = TERMINATE \
--shielded-secure-boot \
--image-project = confidential-space-images \
--image-family = IMAGE_FAMILY_NAME \
--metadata = "^~^tee-image-reference=us-docker.pkg.dev/ WORKLOAD_AUTHOR_PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_NAME :latest~tee-install-gpu-driver=true" \
--service-account = WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ WORKLOAD_OPERATOR_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--scopes = cloud-platform \
--boot-disk-size = 30G \
--reservation-affinity = none \

--project = PROJECT_ID
Provide the following values:
INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME : The name of the new VM
instance template.

confidential-space-debug-preview-cgpu for debug workloads
WORKLOAD_AUTHOR_PROJECT : The project ID that
the workload is being run in.
REPOSITORY_NAME : The Artifact Registry repository
name.
WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_NAME : The name of the
workload container.
WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : The name of the
service account that runs the workload.
WORKLOAD_OPERATOR_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the
project that runs the workload.
RUN_DURATION : the duration you want the
requested VM instances to run. You must format the value as the
number of days, hours, minutes, or seconds followed by d , h ,
m , or s respectively. For example, specify 30m for
30 minutes or 1d2h3m4s for one day, two hours, three minutes,
and four seconds. The value must be between 10 minutes and seven
days.
PROJECT_ID : Optional. The ID of the project to
create the VM instances in.
Create a zonal MIG using the
instance-groups managed create command :
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME \
--template = INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME \
--size = 0 \
--zone = ZONE_NAME \
--default-action-on-vm-failure = do_nothing
Provide the following values:
INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME : The name of the MIG.
INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME : The name of the
instance template for GPU VMs.
ZONE_NAME : One of the
zones that support NVIDIA Confidential Computing
( Preview ).
In the MIG, create a resize request. Specify the number of GPU VM
instances that you want, and the duration to run those VM instances.
gcloud compute instance-groups managed resize-requests create INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME \
--resize-request = RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME \
--resize-by = COUNT \
--zone = ZONE_NAME
Provide the following values:
INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME : The name of the MIG.
INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME : The name of the
instance template for GPU VM instances.
ZONE_NAME : One of the
zones that support NVIDIA Confidential Computing
( Preview ).
RESIZE_REQUEST_NAME : The name of the resize
request.
COUNT : The number of VM instances to add all at
once in the group.
The resize request that you create stays in the ACCEPTED state
until the MIG creates all the requested GPU VM instances. After all
GPU VM instances are created in the group, the state of the request
changes to SUCCEEDED .
When enough resources are available for the resize request,
VM instances are added to the MIG and launched to run your workload.
To list instances that are present in the MIG, run the following
command:
gcloud compute instance-groups managed list-instances INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME \
--zone = ZONE_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Provide the following values:
INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME : The name of the MIG.
ZONE_NAME : The
supported zone
to get a list of VM instances from.
PROJECT_ID : Optional. The ID of the project to
get a list of VM instances from.
Attached service account
A service account must be attached to a workload's Confidential VM to run the
workload. The service account must be set up in the following way:
With the following roles:
roles/confidentialcomputing.workloadUser to generate an attestation token.
roles/artifactregistry.reader to retrieve a workload container image
stored in Artifact Registry .
roles/logging.logWriter if you want to
redirect STDOUT and STDERR to Cloud Logging .
With read access to where the data collaborators store their confidential
data, for example, a Cloud Storage bucket or BigQuery
table.
With write access to where the workload should output the data, for example,
a Cloud Storage bucket. Data collaborators should have read access
to this location.
Additionally, data collaborators and workload operators need to set up the
following things:
If data collaborators are using
service account impersonation instead of direct resources access ,
they must add the service account to their workload identity pool provider as
an attribute condition:
' WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ DATA_COLLABORATOR_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com' in assertion.google_service_accounts
The workload operator needs the roles/iam.serviceAccountUser role to
impersonate the service account. This lets them attach it to a workload VM
instance so it can run the workload.
Metadata variables
You can change the Confidential Space workload VM behavior by passing variables
into the --metadata option when you create the VM.
To pass in multiple variables, first set the delimiter by prefixing the
--metadata value with ^~^ . This sets the delimiter to ~ , as , is used in
variable values.
For example:
metadata="^~^tee-restart-policy=Always ~ tee-image-reference=us-docker.pkg.dev/ WORKLOAD_AUTHOR_PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY_NAME / WORKLOAD_CONTAINER_NAME :latest"
The following table details the metadata variables you can set for your
workload VM.
Note: Some metadata variables can be affected by launch policies set by workload authors.
