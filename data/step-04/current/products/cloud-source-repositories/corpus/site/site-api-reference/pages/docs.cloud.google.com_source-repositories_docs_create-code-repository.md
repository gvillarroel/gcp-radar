Effective June 17, 2024, Cloud Source Repositories isn't available to new customers. For alternative source hosting options, Secure Source Manager is a regionally deployed, single tenant, managed source code repository hosted on Google Cloud.
If your organization hasn't previously used Cloud Source Repositories, you can't enable the API or use Cloud Source Repositories. New projects not connected to an organization can't enable the Cloud Source Repositories API. Organizations that have used Cloud Source Repositories prior to June 17, 2024 are not affected by this change.

Creating an empty repository
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can use Cloud Source Repositories to create a new, empty repository. Creating a
repository is useful when you want to start a project or back up a Git
repository using Cloud Source Repositories.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
