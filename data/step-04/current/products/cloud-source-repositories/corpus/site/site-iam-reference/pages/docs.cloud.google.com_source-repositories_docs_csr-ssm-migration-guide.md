Effective June 17, 2024, Cloud Source Repositories isn't available to new customers. For alternative source hosting options, Secure Source Manager is a regionally deployed, single tenant, managed source code repository hosted on Google Cloud.
If your organization hasn't previously used Cloud Source Repositories, you can't enable the API or use Cloud Source Repositories. New projects not connected to an organization can't enable the Cloud Source Repositories API. Organizations that have used Cloud Source Repositories prior to June 17, 2024 are not affected by this change.

Migrate to Secure Source Manager
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide describes how to migrate a Git repository, including all its
information, from Google's Cloud Source Repositories (CSR) to Secure Source Manager (SSM).
This migration uses standard Git commands to clone and push repository data.
Prerequisites
Before you begin the migration, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:
Permissions : The user or service accounts must have the following
permissions to perform the migration:
source.repos.get , which is available in the roles/source.reader
role, on the source CSR repository
securesourcemanager.instances.access , which is available in the
roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor role, and
securesourcemanager.repositories.fetch , which is available in the
roles/securesourcemanager.repoWriter role, on the target SSM instance
and repository. If you are creating new repositories, see
Create a repository .
Git Client : You need a computer with the Git command-line tool
installed.
Google Cloud SDK : To authenticate when using HTTPS, you must install version
395.0.0 or later on the same computer where you installed the Git tool.
If you don't have the Google Cloud SDK, you must connect to both CSR and SSM
using SSH keys.
SSM Instance : Make sure you can access the SSM instance from your
computer. If your instance is configured using Private Service Connect, see
Access a private instance
for access details.
Local Storage : You need enough local disk space to temporarily store
clones of the repositories you are migrating.
Migration Steps
The migration process involves cloning the complete repository from CSR to your
local computer and then pushing the clone to the SSM repository.
Determine access principal and method for CSR, SSM repositories
You can connect to CSR using HTTP or SSH transports when you authenticate as a
user principal, or through HTTP when you authenticate as a service account. You
can connect and authenticate with SSM using HTTP or SSH transports, as a user or
service account principal.
You don't need to use the same transport or principal across CSR and SSM.
Determine the principal and transport you will use for each platform. For more
information on impersonating service accounts, see
Service account impersonation .
Ensure CSR Repository is Read-Only
This migration guide doesn't use automatic mirroring or synchronization.
Therefore, make sure no one writes to the CSR repository during or after the
migration. Update IAM permissions so no user has a role other
than roles/source.reader on the repository. Alternatively, coordinate with
your users to halt all commits during the migration.
Create Secure Source Manager Repository
You can skip this step if an administrator has already created the repository
for you.
To create an empty repository in your SSM instance, follow the guide to
create a new repository .
Make sure that:
If using the UI, don't select Initialize Repository , because this
creates a non-empty repository.
If using Google Cloud CLI, don't set the --gitignores , --readme , and
--licenses flags, because this creates a non-empty repository.
If using the API, don't set the gitignores , license , and readme
fields of the InitialConfig , because this creates a non-empty repository.
Validate SSM Repository Settings
Verify that the repository is empty by checking the UI or by cloning the
repository and running git show-ref . The output is empty if the repository
is empty.
Make sure there are no active branch protection rules by checking the UI or by
using the API. There should be no rules, or all rules should be disabled to
prevent blocking the migration.
Ensure local and remote disk space
Before cloning the CSR repository, find its total size. Run
gcloud source repos describe <var>CSR_REPO_NAME</var> . This command shows the
total number of bytes in the repository. To assess available disk space on a
Linux system, run df . to see the number of bytes available in the current
directory.
SSM has a default limit of 100 GB of storage per instance. Verify that the CSR
repository will fit before you clone it.
Clone the CSR Repository
Clone the full repository history from CSR to your local computer.
Go to the local directory where you want to temporarily store the
repository.
Clone the repository:
sh
git clone <var>CSR_REPO_URL</var> --mirror
This command creates a bare clone, which is optimized for pushing the entire
repository contents to another remote. You'll notice that the directory only
contains files like config and HEAD , instead of your repository contents.
This is expected; all the repository content has been cloned and is present in
the objects directory and others, but there is no working copy.
Add the Secure Source Manager Repository as a New Remote
Run the following command:
git remote add ssm <var>SSM_REPOSITORY_URL</var>
Push the Full Repository to Secure Source Manager
Push all branches, tags, and references from the local clone to the SSM
remote:
git push --mirror ssm
Validation
After the push operation is complete, clone the SSM repository into a different
directory. Then, compare the CSR and SSM copies of the repository:
Number of branches : Run git branch -r in each repository and verify
that the number of branches is the same. On Linux or macOS systems, piping
the command to wc -l counts lines of output.
Number of tags : Run git tag in each repository and verify that the
number of tags is the same. On Linux or macOS systems, piping the command
to wc -l counts lines of output.
HEAD commit : Run git rev-parse HEAD in each repository, and verify
that the commit hash is equal.
Commit count : Run git rev-list --all --count in each repository, and
verify that the number of commits is the same.
Cleanup
If you impersonated a service account during the migration, then run
gcloud config set account to reset your credentials.
If you disabled branch protection rules,
then re-enable Branch Protection Rules on the SSM repository.
Remove bare copies of the CSR repository from the computer you used for the
migration.
Delete the original CSR repository.
