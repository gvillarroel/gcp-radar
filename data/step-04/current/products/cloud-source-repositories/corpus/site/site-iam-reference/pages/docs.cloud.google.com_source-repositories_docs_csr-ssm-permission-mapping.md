Effective June 17, 2024, Cloud Source Repositories isn't available to new customers. For alternative source hosting options, Secure Source Manager is a regionally deployed, single tenant, managed source code repository hosted on Google Cloud.
If your organization hasn't previously used Cloud Source Repositories, you can't enable the API or use Cloud Source Repositories. New projects not connected to an organization can't enable the Cloud Source Repositories API. Organizations that have used Cloud Source Repositories prior to June 17, 2024 are not affected by this change.

Translate Cloud Source Repositories roles and permissions to Secure Source Manager
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide shows Cloud Source Repositories (CSR) users how its access controls
translate to Secure Source Manager (SSM). To follow this guide, you should know
IAM and CSR, and
have a basic understanding of SSM.
Resource Models
CSR has one Google Cloud resource that is a child of a project:
A repository, projects/<var>project</var>/repositories/<var>repo</var>
SSM has two resources that are regionalized children of a project:
An instance, projects/<var>project</var>/locations/<var>location</var>/instances/<var>instance</var>
A repository, which is the most direct equivalent to a CSR repository and
must be attached to (but is not a child of) an SSM instance in the same
project and location,
projects/<var>project</var>/locations/<var>location</var>/repositories/<var>repo</var>
SSM has other resources, but they are modeled as children of the repository.
This guide considers them part of the repository.
Roles
CSR has three roles: roles/source.reader , roles/source.writer , and
roles/source.admin . You can bind the reader and writer roles to a repository or
project. You should only bind the Administrator role to a project because the
source.repos.create permission applies only at project scope.
SSM has 11 roles for user principals, a significant increase compared to
Cloud Source Repositories. You can group these roles into two categories (plus a
superuser role).
The superuser role ( roles/securesourcemanager.admin ) grants all SSM
permissions. You must bind this role to a project because instance permissions
don't apply if you bind them to a repository, and repository permissions don't
apply if you bind them to an instance.
SSM Instance Roles
Instance roles grant permissions to access a Secure Source Manager instance's UI and
connect to it using Git. You must grant users at least one instance role to
allow them to access repositories on the instance. You can bind these roles to
an instance resource or a project.
Role
Permissions
roles/securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor
Access an instance and its repositories. Required for repository-level
roles to be effective.
roles/securesourcemanager.instanceManager
Manage instance-level configurations.
roles/securesourcemanager.instanceOwner
Full control over instance configurations.
roles/securesourcemanager.instanceRepoCreator
Create repositories on an instance.
roles/securesourcemanager.sshKeyUser
Manage SSH keys for authentication to an instance. Doesn't grant
instance access on its own.
SSM Repository Roles
Repository roles grant permissions on repositories within a Secure Source Manager
instance. You can bind these roles to a repository resource or a project, except
for repoCreator , which you must bind to a project.
Role
Permissions
roles/securesourcemanager.repoAdmin
Full control over a repository, including repository settings and user
access.
roles/securesourcemanager.repoPullRequestApprover
Approve pull requests in a repository.
roles/securesourcemanager.repoReader
Read repository content and view pull requests and issues.
roles/securesourcemanager.repoWriter
Read and write repository content, and manage pull requests and
issues.
roles/securesourcemanager.repoCreator
Create new repositories within a project.
Mapping CSR roles to SSM
To use SSM effectively, you need at least two roles: one
instance role, and one repository role. There is no 1:1 mapping from a CSR role
to an SSM role. These recipes provide equivalent access only for source control,
not for SSM features such as pull requests, issues, or instance management.
In CSR, you could create repositories across multiple projects. In Secure Source Manager,
all repositories on an instance belong to the same project as the instance.
If you bind any role at the project level in Secure Source Manager, you grant that role's
permissions to every repository on that instance. If you need to grant
permissions to specific repositories only, use repository-level bindings.
Mapping source.reader
If you bound this role at the repository level, bind
securesourcemanager.repoReader on the repository resource and
securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor on the host instance to recreate the
same level of access. If you bound the role at the project level, binding
repoReader and instanceAccessor at the project level grants read access to
all repositories on the instance.
Mapping source.writer
If you bound this role at the repository level, bind
securesourcemanager.repoWriter on the repository resource and
securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor on the host instance to recreate the
same level of access. If you bound the role at the project level, binding
repoWriter and instanceAccessor at the project level grants write access to
all repositories on the instance.
Mapping source.admin
You only bind this role at the project level. You can recreate it by binding a
combination of securesourcemanager.instanceAccessor ,
securesourcemanager.repoAdmin , securesourcemanager.instanceRepoCreator ,
and securesourcemanager.repoCreator at the project level. This combination of
roles grants permission to create repositories on any instance in the project,
and grants administrators permissions to all repositories on any instance in
the project. To grant all SSM
permissions in the same way that source.admin granted all CSR permissions,
bind the superuser role, securesourcemanager.admin , at the project level.
Differences between SSM and CSR
This section outlines key changes in how Secure Source Manager handles roles and permissions
compared to Cloud Source Repositories.
Implicit role grant
When you create a new repository resource, the calling principal is automatically
granted the repoAdmin role on the newly created repository resource.
New resource types
SSM has more features than CSR, and these features are modeled as new resource types.
These features include branch protection rules, hooks, issues, and pull requests,
in addition to comments on issues and pull requests. These resources are children of the
repository resource. Repository roles include permissions for these resources.
For example, repoAdmin and repoWriter provide write access, while repoReader
grants only read access.
Fine-grained roles
SSM includes fine-grained roles that provide specific access controls.
roles/securesourcemanager.repoPullRequestApprover grants only the
permission to approve pull requests. Use this role with repoReader and
instanceAccessor to let a user access an instance, browse the
repository, and approve pull requests without modifying other data.
roles/securesourcemanager.repoCreator grants only the permission to create
repositories in a project. Because repositories must be attached to an
instance, you must also have
roles/securesourcemanager.instanceRepoCreator to attach a repository
to an instance. Use roles/securesourcemanager.repoCreator with
instanceRepoCreator to grant permissions to create repositories and
attach them to an instance.
