Access control with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Access control in Google Cloud is controlled using
Identity and Access Management
(IAM). IAM allows you to set permissions
specifying who has what kind of access to which resources in your
project.
Cloud Source Repositories uses IAM for access control. You can use
IAM to add team members to your project and to grant them
permissions to create, view, and update repositories.
This page describes the IAM permissions and roles that apply to
Cloud Source Repositories.
Permissions

requires that the account initiating the action has the appropriate permissions.
You don't grant specific permissions to an account. Instead, you grant a role
that contains the appropriate set of permissions.

Cloud Source Repositories.
