Effective June 17, 2024, Cloud Source Repositories isn't available to new customers. For alternative source hosting options, Secure Source Manager is a regionally deployed, single tenant, managed source code repository hosted on Google Cloud.
If your organization hasn't previously used Cloud Source Repositories, you can't enable the API or use Cloud Source Repositories. New projects not connected to an organization can't enable the Cloud Source Repositories API. Organizations that have used Cloud Source Repositories prior to June 17, 2024 are not affected by this change.

Mirroring a GitHub repository
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This topic describes how to mirror a GitHub repository to Cloud Source Repositories.
With this configuration, commits that you push to the GitHub repository are
copied, or mirrored , into a repository hosted in Cloud Source Repositories.
Only Bitbucket Cloud and GitHub Cloud repositories can be mirrored to
Cloud Source Repositories; self-hosted Bitbucket and GitHub mirroring are not
supported.
If you are mirroring your GitHub repository to Cloud Source Repositories to integrate
with Cloud Build and do not need any other Cloud Source Repositories features,
follow the Cloud Build instructions on
building repositories from GitHub
instead.
Before you begin
When you mirror a repository, you must provide GitHub authentication
credentials. These credentials let Cloud Source Repositories access the
contents of the GitHub repository.
If you're using
GitHub organizations ,
we recommend that you use a
machine user account
specifically dedicated to automated tasks,
such as mirroring a repository. This account must have administrative access
to your repository.
Mirror a GitHub repository
This section shows how to mirror a GitHub repository to
Cloud Source Repositories.
Note: Make sure you're signed out of GitHub before you mirror a repository.
Signing out helps ensure you select the right GitHub account when you connect
the GitHub repository to Cloud Source Repositories.
Create a mirrored repository
In this process, you need your GitHub machine user credentials to grant
Google Cloud read access to the GitHub repository.
In the Google Cloud console, open Cloud Source Repositories.
Open Cloud Source Repositories
Click Add repository .
The Add a repository page opens.
Select Connect external repository and click Continue .
The Connect external repository page opens.
In the Project drop-down list, select the Google Cloud
project to which the mirrored repository belongs.
If you don't have a project, you can click Create project to
create a project .
In the Git provider drop-down list, select GitHub .
Select the checkbox to authorize Cloud Source Repositories to store your
credentials.
Click Connect to GitHub .
Sign in to GitHub with your machine user credentials.
Click Authorize GoogleCloudPlatform .
This option grants Google Cloud read access to all repositories in the
GitHub user account.
When authorization finishes, you're returned to the Connect external
repository page. A list of repositories opens.
From the list of repositories, select the repository you want to mirror.
Click Connect Selected Repository .
The main repository page opens. This page contains a list of the
repositories for this Google Cloud project, including the new
repository you just created.
Identify GitHub repositories
Cloud Source Repositories makes it clear which of your repositories are
mirrors of GitHub repositories:
Each GitHub repository is represented with the GitHub logo.
The name of the repository has github_ added to the beginning of its name.
Force a repository sync
After you set up mirroring, Cloud Source Repositories automatically syncs
your repository with the mirrored repository when a user commits a change.
Cloud Source Repositories lets you view the last time your mirrored
repository was synced and manually force a sync if necessary.
In the Google Cloud console, browse to the mirrored GitHub repository.
Click
Settings settings .
The sync status is displayed.
To manually force a sync of the repositories, click Sync from GitHub .
Note: Repositories connected using an older version of the connected repository
service may not have these options.
