Dataform core reference
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the methods, properties, and configuration options of
Dataform core. You can use Dataform core in SQLX
and JavaScript files.
assert()
assert
(name: string, query?: AContextable )
Adds a Dataform assertion the compiled graph.
Available only in the /definitions directory.
Example:
// definitions/file.js
assert ( "name" ). query ( ctx = > "select 1" );
CommonContext
Context methods are available when evaluating contextable SQL code,
such as within SQLX files, or when using a
Contextable argument with Dataform core.
database
() => string
Returns the database of this dataset, if applicable.
name
() => string
Returns the name of this table.
ref
(ref: Resolvable | string[], rest: string[]) => string
References another action, adding it as a dependency to this action,
returning valid SQL to be used in a from expression.
This function can be called with a Resolvable object, for example:
${ref({ name: "name", schema: "schema", database: "database" })}
This function can also be called using individual arguments for the
"database" , "schema" , and "name" values.
When only two values are provided, the default database is used and the values
are interpreted as "schema" and "name" .
When only one value is provided, the default database and schema are used,
with the provided value interpreted as `"name"`.
${ref("database", "schema", "name")}
${ref("schema", "name")}
${ref("name")}
resolve
(ref: Resolvable | string[], rest: string[]) => string
Similar to ref , but it does not add the referenced
action as a dependency to this action.
self
() => string
Equivalent to resolve(name()) .
Returns a valid SQL string that can be used to reference the table
produced by this action.
schema
() => string
Returns the schema of this dataset.
Contextable
Contextable arguments can either pass a plain value for their generic type
T or a function that is called with the context object for this
type of operation.
T | (ctx: Context) => T
Dataform
Global variable that contains the IProjectConfig object.
Required for getting IProjectConfig properties, for example:
dataform.projectConfig.vars.myVariableName === "myVariableValue"
declare()
declare
(dataset: dataform.ITarget)
Declares the dataset as a Dataform data source.
Available only in the /definitions directory.
Example:
// definitions/file.js
declare ({ name : "a-declaration" })
defaultLocation
The defaultLocation property specifies your default BigQuery
dataset location. Dataform uses this location to process your
code and store the results. This processing location must match the location of
your BigQuery datasets. However, it doesn't need to match the
Dataform repository location.
If you don't set the defaultLocation property, Dataform
determines the location based on the datasets your SQL query references. This
works as follows:
If your query references datasets from the same location,
Dataform uses that location.
If your query references datasets from two or more different locations, an
error occurs. For details about this limitation, see
Cross-region dataset replication .
If your query doesn't reference any datasets, the default location for
Dataform is the US multi-region. To choose a different
location, set the defaultLocation property. Alternatively, use the
@@location system variable
in your query.
For more information, see
Specify locations .
IActionConfig
Defines Dataform tags
and dependencies applied to a workflow action.
tags
string[]
A list of user-defined tags with which the action should be labeled.
dependencies
Resolvable| Resolvable[]

string
The database (Google Cloud project ID) in which to create
the corresponding view for this assertion.
description
string
A description of this assertion.
disabled
boolean
If set to true , this action is not run.
The action can still be depended upon. Useful for temporarily
turning off broken actions.
hermetic
boolean
Declares whether this action is hermetic. An action is hermetic
if all of its dependencies are explicitly declared.
If this action depends on data from a source which is not declared
as a dependency, then set hermetic to false .
Otherwise, set to true .
schema
string
The schema (BigQuery dataset) in which to create
the corresponding view for this assertion.
tags
string[]
A list of user-defined tags applied to this action.

Key-value pairs for the table , view ,
and materialized view options.
Some options, for example, partitionExpirationDays ,
have dedicated type/validity checked fields.
For such options, use the dedicated fields.
String values must be encapsulated in double-quotes, for example:
additionalOptions: {numeric_option: "5" ,
string_option: '"string-value"'}
If the option name contains special characters, encapsulate the name in quotes,
for example: additionalOptions: { "option-name": "value" } .
clusterBy
string[]
The keys by which to cluster partitions by .
labels
Key-value pairs for BigQuery labels.
If the label name contains special characters, for example, hyphens,
then quote its name, for example, labels: { "label-name": "value" }.
partitionBy
string
The key by which to
partition the table .
Typically the name of a timestamp or the date column.
partitionExpirationDays
number
The number of days for which BigQuery stores data in
each partition. The setting applies to all partitions in a table,
but is calculated independently for each partition based on
the partition time.
requirePartitionFilter
boolean
Declares whether the partitioned table requires a WHERE
clause predicate filter that filters the partitioning column.
updatePartitionFilter
string
SQL-based filter for when
incremental updates
are applied.

connection
string
Optional. The resource name of your Cloud Storage connection,
which provides credentials for reading from and writing to external
storage. It can be formatted in the following ways:
PROJECT_ID . LOCATION . CONNECTION_ID
Replace the following values:
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID
LOCATION : the location name of the connection
CONNECTION_ID : the name or ID of the connection
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /connections/ CONNECTION_ID
DEFAULT
Defaults to DEFAULT . For more information, see the
Default connection overview .

Optional. The file format for the table data.
Only PARQUET is supported. Defaults to PARQUET .
bucket_name
string
Required at either the table or workflow level. The name of the
Cloud Storage bucket where the table data is stored.
You must provide bucket_name in the config block
of the table definition file, or set a workflow-level default in the
workflow_settings.yaml file. If neither is provided,
compilation fails. For more information, see
Configure workflow-level defaults for Iceberg tables
.
table_folder_root
string
Optional. The name of the first-level folder inside the
Cloud Storage bucket where table data is stored.
If you don't set this property, Dataform uses the
workflow-level default from workflow_settings.yaml if it is
set. Otherwise, it defaults to _dataform .
table_folder_subpath
string
Optional. A sub-folder within the tableFolderRoot .
If you don't set this property, Dataform uses the workflow-level
default from workflow_settings.yaml if one is set. If neither
the property nor a workflow-level default is set, the subpath defaults to
DATASET_NAME / TABLE_NAME .
These values construct the Cloud Storage URI in the following format:
gs:// BUCKET_NAME / TABLE_FOLDER_ROOT / TABLE_FOLDER_SUBPATH .

You can
set IProjectConfig properties in workflow settings
at the repository level.
You can
override the defaultSchema and defaultDatabase properties for individual tables .
You can access all IProjectConfig properties in a SQL SELECT statement
in a SQLX or JavaScript file.
The following code sample shows the myVariableName custom compilation variable
set in
workflow settings
with the projectConfig.vars property, accessed in a SELECT statement in a
SQLX file:
config { type: "view" }
SELECT ${when(
dataform.projectConfig.vars.myVariableName === "myVariableValue",
"myVariableName is set to myVariableValue!",
"myVariableName is not set to myVariableValue!"

ITableContext
Context methods are available when evaluating contextable SQL code,
such as within SQLX files, or when using a Contextable
argument with Dataform core.
incremental

Returns true when the current context indicates that
the table will be built incrementally.
name
() => string
Returns the fully qualified name of this table.
ref
(ref: Resolvable | string[], rest: string[]) => string

returning valid SQL to be used in a from expression.
This function can be called with a Resolvable object, for example:
${ref({ name: "name", schema: "schema", database: "database" })}
This function can also be called using individual arguments for the
"database" , "schema" , and "name" values.
When only two values are provided, the default database is used and the values
are interpreted as "schema" and "name" .
When only one value is provided, the default database schema is used, with the
provided value interpreted as `"name"`.
${ref("database", "schema", "name")}
${ref("schema", "name")}
${ref("name")}
resolve
(ref: Resolvable | string[], rest: string[]) => string
Similar to ref , but instead of adding a dependency,
it resolves the provided reference so that it can be used in SQL,
for example, in a `from` expression.
self
() => string
Equivalent to resolve(name()) .
Returns a valid SQL string that can be used to reference
the table produced by this action.
when
(cond: boolean, trueCase: string, falseCase: string) => string

onSchemaChange
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Note: To provide feedback or request support, contact
dataform-preview-support@google.com .
After you set the onSchemaChange property, Dataform
checks the SELECT query to determine if columns were added or removed.
Dataform then performs the action specified by the
onSchemaChange property's value. You can set the action to one of the
following:
IGNORE (default): ignores added columns and shows an error for missing
columns. If onSchemaChange is unset, this is the default behavior when
the schema changes.
FAIL : stops the action if Dataform detects any schema
change, which helps to keep the schema consistent.
EXTEND : adds new columns from the query to the incremental table, and
adds NULL values for previous records. Shows an error if a column is
removed or missing from the original schema in the query. You can use this
setting to add new columns to your incremental tables during runtime.
SYNCHRONIZE : adds new columns from the query to the incremental table,
and adds NULL values for previous records. Removes columns that were in
the original schema but that are now missing from the current query.
Caution: The SYNCHRONIZE action cannot be undone, and you might lose
data when you remove columns with this option. Note: Deleting partitioned and clustered columns isn't supported, as
deleting these columns can have negative consequences. If a
partitioned or clustered column is still deleted, it's handled
with the
ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN statement .
Dataform doesn't perform checks or validations to
prevent the running of ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN statements on
partitioned or clustered columns. Therefore, if you drop such columns,
proceed cautiously and be aware of potential negative consequences.
operate()
operate
(name: string, queries?: Contextable )
Defines a SQL operation.
Available only in the /definitions directory.
Example:
// definitions/file.js
operate ( "an-operation" , [ "SELECT 1" , "SELECT 2" ])
publish()
publish
(name: string, queryOrConfig?: Contextable | ITableConfig)

Available only in the /definitions directory.
Example:
// definitions/file.js
publish ( "published-table" , {
type : "table" ,
dependencies : [ "a-declaration" ],
}). query ( ctx = > "SELECT 1 AS test" );
Resolvable
A resolvable can be either the name of a table as string ,
or the object that describes the full path to the relation.
string | ITarget
TableType
Supported types of table actions.
Tables of type view will be created as views.
Tables of type table will be created as tables.
Tables of type incremental must include a where clause.
