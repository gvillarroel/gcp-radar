Best practices for the workflow lifecycle
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes best practices for managing the workflow lifecycle in
Dataform: creating development, staging, and production environments,
and configuring compilation and execution settings for each environment.
To create a standardized lifecycle of Dataform workflows that
maintains data hygiene and optimizes development processes,
we recommend that you:
Create execution environments to isolate tables created during
development from tables available to end users.
Configure release and workflow configurations to run workflows
in a production environment, and optionally in a staging environment.
This document describes solutions for isolating development
tables with
workspace compilation overrides and
configuring staging and production environments
release configurations
and workflow configurations .
These solutions let you create execution environments within a single
Dataform repository and Google Cloud project. You may choose to have
multiple copies of a Dataform repository, housed in different
Google Cloud project, with each project corresponding to a stage of your code
lifecycle, for example, development, staging, and production. This approach
lets you customize Identity and Access Management permissions
at each stage of your code lifecycle.
Best practices for isolated execution environments
We recommend that you isolate tables created during development workflow
executions from production tables in BigQuery.
This ensures that end users can navigate to production
tables and eliminates the risk of end users accessing incorrect data by accident.
You can create isolated execution environments the following ways:
Split development and production tables by schema
Recommended for small teams. Dataform creates development and
production tables in different schemas in BigQuery.
Dataform runs all development tables in schemas that have
the same suffix, which marks that they were created during development.
Developers can overwrite each other's development tables.
Split development and production tables by schema and Google Cloud project
Recommended for medium-sized teams. Dataform creates development and
production tables in different schemas and projects in BigQuery.
Dataform published all development tables
in a dedicated development Google Cloud project.
Each Dataform developer has their own unique schema for development
tables. This solution eliminates the risk of developers
accidentally overwriting each other's development tables. The downside to
this approach is that deleting development tables and schemas, and re-creating
all tables in each environment may require more time.
Split development, staging, and production tables per Google Cloud project
Recommended for large teams or teams that require a staging environment.
Dataform runs tables from each environment in a dedicated
Google Cloud project in BigQuery. This solution gives you the
most control over the code lifecycle.
All solutions require a single Dataform repository
connected to a single third-party remote repository .
In all solutions, developers
manually trigger runs of development
tables inside their Dataform workspaces. Dataform
automatically compiles production and staging tables in a release configuration,
and runs them at the frequency set in a workflow configuration.
Split development and production by schema
This solution creates two execution environments in which Dataform
will run your workflows: development and production.
To split development and production tables by schema, you need to configure
workflow settings, workspace compilation overrides, and a release
configuration. To schedule production runs, you need to
create a workflow configuration.
Dataform runs all the development tables in the schemas that have the
same suffix, which marks that they were created during development.
Dataform runs all the production tables in the schemas without any suffix.
The following table shows a configuration that splits development
and production tables by schema, with one development schema:
Setting
Development
Production
Google Cloud project
enterprise-analytics
enterprise-analytics
Git branch
name of the workspace
main
Workspace compilation overrides
schema suffix: dev
-
Release configuration
-
production
Workflow configuration
-
production
In this solution, development and production tables are stored in a single
Google Cloud project.
Developers trigger execution manually in their Dataform workspaces.
In all manually triggered executions, Dataform runs tables in
schemas that have the same suffix, which marks that they were created
during development. Developers need to be aware that they can
overwrite each other's tables.
In Dataform, developers commit and push their changes to their custom
branches of the remote repository. Then, in the third-party Git hosting platform,
they submit pull requests. Approval of a pull request merges changes
to the main branch of the remote repository.
Dataform automatically compiles production tables from the
main branch of the remote repository into a compilation result according to
the production release configuration settings.
Dataform automatically runs the production compilation result
according to the schedule set in the production workflow configuration.
To implement this solution, configure the following Dataform settings:
Workflow settings
Depending on your version of Dataform core, workflow settings are
stored in workflow_settings.yaml or dataform.json . For more information, see
Configure Dataform workflow settings .
In workflow_settings.yaml configure the following settings:
defaultProject : enterprise-analytics
defaultDataset : analytics
In dataform.json , configure the following settings:
{
de fault Schema : "analytics" ,
de fault Da ta base : "enterprise-analytics"
}
Workspace overrides
Schema suffix: "dev"
Release configuration
Git commitish: "main"
To schedule runs of production compilation results,
create a workflow configuration .
Sample development process
In this example, developers Sasha and Kai work in the
same Dataform repository. The Dataform repository is connected
to a remote third-party Git repository.
They commit and push changes to custom branches in the remote repository,
called sasha and kai .
The following table shows applied environment settings for Sasha, Kai,
and the production environment:
Setting
Sasha
Kai
Production
Google Cloud project
enterprise-analytics
enterprise-analytics
enterprise-analytics
Git branch
sasha
kai
main
Schema
analytics_dev
analytics_dev
analytics
Sasha creates a new table and deploys it to production in the following process:
In a Dataform workspace, Sasha creates the user_stats table.
In the workspace, Sasha manually triggers execution of the table.
Dataform creates the
enterprise-analytics.analytics_dev.user_stats table in the
analytics_dev schema in the enterprise-analytics
Google Cloud project in BigQuery.
In the workspace, Sasha commits the change and pushes it to the sasha
branch in the remote Git repository.
In the remote repository, Sasha submits a pull request.
In the remote repository, Kai reviews and approves the pull request,
merging the change to the main branch.
Dataform automatically updates the compilation result in the
production release at the specified frequency. During the next update of the
production compilation result, Dataform adds the
enterprise-analytics.analytics.user_stats table to the compilation result.
During a scheduled execution of a workflow configuration, Dataform
runs the enterprise-analytics.analytics.user_stats table
in the analytics schema in the enterprise-analytics Google Cloud project
in BigQuery.
The user_stats table is available to end users in the analytics
schema in the enterprise-analytics Google Cloud project in BigQuery.
Split development and production by schema and project
This solution creates two execution environments: development and production.
To split development and production tables by schema and Google Cloud project,
you need to configure workflow settings, workspace compilation overrides,
and a release configuration. To schedule production runs, you need to
create a workflow configuration.
In this solution, Dataform runs development
in a dedicated development Google Cloud project,
in schemas with a different schema suffix for each workspace.
Dataform runs all production tables in BigQuery
a dedicated production Google Cloud project with no schema suffix.
The following table shows a configuration that splits development
and production tables by schema and Google Cloud project, with one development
schema per a Dataform workspace:
Setting
Development
Production
Google Cloud project
enterprise-dev
enterprise-prod
Git branch
name of the workspace
main
Workspace compilation overrides
schema suffix: ${workspaceName}
-
Release configuration
-
production
Workflow configuration
-
production
In this solution, Dataform runs development and production tables
in different schemas and Google Cloud projects in BigQuery.
Developers trigger execution manually in their Dataform workspaces.
Each developer works in their dedicated workspace, named after them,
for example, sasha .
When a developer triggers execution in their workspace,
Dataform appends the workspace name as the schema suffix
to all schemas. Then, Dataform runs
tables in the custom schema.
For example, Dataform creates tables from the sasha workspace
in the analytics_sasha schema in BigQuery. This way, each developer
stores their development tables in their own schema(s). There is no risk of
accidentally overwriting tables of other developers.
In Dataform, developers commit and push their changes to their custom
branches of the remote repository. Then, in the third-party Git hosting platform,
they submit pull requests. Approval of a pull request merges changes
to the main branch of the remote repository.
Dataform automatically compiles production tables from the
main branch of the remote repository into a compilation result according to
the production release configuration settings.
Dataform automatically runs the production compilation result
according to the schedule set in the production workflow configuration.
To implement this solution, configure the following Dataform settings:
Workflow settings
Depending on your version of Dataform core, workflow settings are
stored in workflow_settings.yaml or dataform.json . For more information, see
Configure Dataform workflow settings .
In workflow_settings.yaml , configure the following settings:
defaultProject : enterprise-dev
defaultDataset : analytics
In dataform.json , configure the following settings:
{
de fault Schema : "analytics" ,
de fault Da ta base : "enterprise-dev"
}
Workspace overrides
Schema suffix: "${workspaceName}"
Release configuration
Git commitish: "main"
Google Cloud project ID: "enterprise-prod"
To schedule runs of production compilation results,
create a workflow configuration
with a custom schedule that best fits your needs.
Sample development process
In this example, developers Sasha and Kai work on the
same Dataform repository. The Dataform repository is connected
to a remote third-party Git repository.
Sasha works in their dedicated workspace called sasha ,
and Kai works in their dedicated workspace called Kai .
They commit and push changes to custom branches in the remote repository,
called sasha and kai .
The following table shows applied environment settings for Sasha, Kai,
and the production environment:

Sasha creates a new table and deploys it to production in the following process:
In the sasha Dataform workspace, Sasha creates
the user_stats table.
In the sasha workspace, Sasha manually triggers execution of the table.
Dataform runs the
enterprise-dev.analytics_sasha.user_stats table in the
analytics_sasha schema in the enterprise-dev Google Cloud project
in BigQuery.
In the sasha workspace, Sasha commits the change and pushes it to the
sasha branch in the remote Git repository.
In the remote repository, Sasha submits a pull request.
In the remote repository, Kai reviews and approves the pull request,
merging the change to the main branch.
Dataform automatically updates the compilation result in the
production release at the specified frequency. During the next update of the
production compilation result, Dataform adds the
enterprise-prod.analytics.user_stats table to the compilation result.
During a scheduled execution of a workflow configuration, Dataform
runs the enterprise-prod.analytics.user_stats table
in the analytics schema in the enterprise-prod Google Cloud project
in BigQuery.
The user_stats table is available to end users in the analytics
schema in the enterprise-prod Google Cloud project in BigQuery.
It is also possible to split development and production data source declarations by project
and split development and production data source declarations by schema and project .
Split development, staging, and production by schema and project
This solution creates three execution environments: development, staging,
and production. All environments are split by Google Cloud project.
Additionally, development is split from staging and production by schema.
To split development, staging and production tables by schema and Google Cloud project,
you need to configure workflow settings, workspace compilation overrides,
and two release configurations. To schedule staging and production
executions, you need to create two separate workflow configurations.
In this solution, Dataform runs development tables in
BigQuery in multiple development schemas,
one per Dataform workspace, in a dedicated development Google Cloud project.
Dataform runs all staging tables in BigQuery
in a dedicated staging Google Cloud project in schemas that have the same suffix,
which marks that they were created in staging.
Dataform runs all production tables in BigQuery
in a dedicated production Google Cloud project in schemas that have the same suffix,
which marks that they were created in production.
The following table shows an example configuration that splits development,
staging, and production tables by schema and Google Cloud project, with one
development schema per a Dataform workspace:
Setting
Development
Staging
Production
Google Cloud project
enterprise-dev
enterprise-staging
enterprise-prod
Git branch
name of the workspace
main
prod
Workspace compilation overrides
schema suffix: ${workspaceName}
-
-
Release configuration
-
staging
production
Workflow configuration
-
staging
production
In this solution, Dataform runs development, staging, and
production tables in different Google Cloud projects in BigQuery.
Additionally, Dataform runs development tables in multiple custom
schemas, one per workspace. Dataform runs staging and production
tables in the same schema, but in different Google Cloud projects.
Developers trigger execution manually in their Dataform workspaces.
Each developer works in their dedicated workspace, named after them,
for example, sasha .
Each workspace corresponds to a custom BigQuery schema,
named after the workspace. When a developer triggers execution in their workspace,
Dataform appends the workspace name as the schema suffix
to the default schema. Then, Dataform runs
tables in the custom schema in BigQuery.
For example, Dataform runs tables from the sasha workspace
in the analytics_sasha schema in BigQuery. This way, each developer
stores their development tables in their own schema. There is no risk of
accidentally overwriting tables of other developers.
In Dataform, developers commit and push their changes to their custom
branches of the remote repository. Then, in the third-party Git hosting platform,
they submit pull requests to the main branch. Approval of a pull request
merges changes to the main branch of the remote repository.
Dataform automatically compiles staging tables from the
main branch of the remote repository into a compilation result according to
the staging release configuration settings.
Dataform automatically runs the staging compilation result
according to the schedule set in the staging workflow configuration.
To promote tables from staging to production, in the third-party Git hosting
platform, developers submit pull requests from the main branch to the prod
branch. Approval of a pull request merges changes to the prod branch
of the remote repository.
Dataform automatically compiles production tables from the
prod branch of the remote repository into a compilation result according to
the production release configuration settings.
Dataform automatically runs the production compilation result
according to the schedule set in the production workflow configuration.
To implement this solution, configure the following Dataform settings:
Workflow settings
Depending on your version of Dataform core, workflow settings are
stored in workflow_settings.yaml or dataform.json . For more information, see
Configure Dataform workflow settings .
In workflow_settings.yaml , configure the following settings:
defaultProject : enterprise-dev
defaultDataset : analytics
In dataform.json , configure the following settings:
{
de fault Schema : "analytics" ,
de fault Da ta base : "enterprise-dev"
}
Workspace overrides
Schema suffix: "${workspaceName}"
staging release configuration
Git commitish: "main"
Google Cloud project ID: "enterprise-staging"
prod release configuration
Git commitish: "prod"
Google Cloud project ID: "enterprise-prod"
To schedule runs of staging and production compilation results,
create two separate workflow configurations
with custom schedules that best fit your needs.
Sample development process
In this example, developers Sasha and Kai work in the
same Dataform repository. The Dataform repository is connected
to a remote third-party Git repository.
Sasha works in their dedicated workspace called sasha ,
and Kai works in their dedicated workspace called Kai .
They commit and push changes to custom branches in the remote repository,
called sasha and kai .
The following table shows applied environment settings for Sasha, Kai,
and the production environment:

Sasha creates a new table and deploys it to production in the following process:
In the sasha Dataform workspace, Sasha creates
the user_stats table.
In the sasha workspace, Sasha manually triggers execution of the table.
Dataform runs the
enterprise-dev.analytics_sasha.user_stats table in the
analytics_sasha schema in the enterprise-dev Google Cloud project
in BigQuery.
In the sasha workspace, Sasha commits the change and pushes it to the
sasha branch in the remote Git repository.
In the remote repository, Sasha submits a pull request to the main branch.
In the remote repository, Kai reviews and approves the pull request,
merging the change to the main branch.
Dataform automatically updates the compilation result in the
staging release at the specified frequency. During the next update of the
staging compilation result, Dataform adds the
enterprise-staging.analytics.user_stats table to the compilation result.
During a scheduled execution of a workflow configuration, Dataform
runs the enterprise-staging.analytics.user_stats table
in the analytics schema in the enterprise-staging Google Cloud project
in BigQuery.
In the remote repository, Sasha submits a pull request to the prod branch.
In the remote repository, Kai reviews and approves the pull request,
merging the change to the prod branch.
Dataform automatically updates the compilation result in the
production release at the specified frequency. During the next update of the
production compilation result, Dataform adds the
enterprise-prod.analytics.user_stats table to the compilation result.
During a scheduled execution of a workflow configuration, Dataform
runs the enterprise-prod.analytics.user_stats table
in the analytics schema in the enterprise-prod Google Cloud project in
BigQuery.
The user_stats table is available to end users in the analytics
schema in the enterprise-prod Google Cloud project in BigQuery.
Split development and production data source declarations by project
This solution separates development and production data source declarations
by project. Instead of declaring a data source with a static
project, you can dynamically modify data source declarations using
variables from the workflow settings file. This is useful when your data
sources are isolated into separate development and production projects.
In this example, the project variable from the workflow settings file is
injected to the data source declaration using the
dataform.projectConfig.vars.projectVar Dataform variable:
In the source_declaration.sqlx file, configure the following settings:
config {
type : "declaration" ,
database : dataform . projectConfig . vars . projectVar ,
schema : "source_schema" ,
name : "source_name" ,
}
When a workflow executes, Dataform injects the default project
value or any configured project compilation overrides into the declaration.
When you reference this data source in the workflow, it points to either
the development or production data source, depending on the execution
environment.
This solution requires consistent naming conventions for development and
production source schemas and tables. If you need different naming
conventions, use custom compilation variables .
Split development and production data source declarations by schema and project
Important: You must split development and production data source declarations by project
before you can split development and production data source declarations by schema and project.
This solution separates development and production data source declarations
by project and schema. In addition to using the project variable from
the workflow settings file, custom compilation variables are defined to
represent a custom source schema name and a custom source table suffix.
The default values for these variables are aligned to the development data
source and can be overridden with compilation override values for the
production data source, depending on the workflow execution environment.
In the workflow_settings.yaml file, configure the following settings:
defaultProject : development
defaultLocation : US
defaultDataset : development
defaultAssertionDataset : dataform_assertions
dataformCoreVersion : 3.0.0
vars :
sourceSchema : schema_DEV
sourceNameSuffix : _DEV
In the source_declaration.sqlx file, configure the following settings:
config {
type : "declaration" ,
database : dataform . projectConfig . vars . projectVar ,
schema : dataform . projectConfig . vars . sourceSchema ,
name : "source_name" + dataform . projectConfig . vars . sourceNameSuffix ,
}
Variable
Development (default)
Production (overrides)
projectVar
development
production
sourceSchema
schema_DEV
schema_PROD
sourceNameSuffix
_DEV
_PROD
Compiled data source
development.schema_DEV.source_name_DEV
production.schema_PROD.source_name_PROD
In this example, splitting development and production data sources by project
and schema is achieved through the projectVar variable and sourceSchema
custom variable, respectively. Optionally, source table separation is
achieved through a suffix appended to the table name.
The preceding example requires the data sources to be created beforehand in the
separate development and production projects, and requires that the source
schemas and table names follow consistent naming conventions. Additionally,
when referencing a source table, the reference needs to be modified to
use the ${ref("source_name"+dataform.projectConfig.vars.sourceNameSuffix)}
custom compilation variable in order for the references to be resolved correctly.
