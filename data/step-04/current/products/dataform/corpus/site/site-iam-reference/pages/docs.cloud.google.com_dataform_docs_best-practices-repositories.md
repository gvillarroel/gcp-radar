Overview of repository best practices in Dataform
This section presents an overview of best practices for managing repository size,
repository structure, and code lifecycle in Dataform.
Best practices for repository size
Repository size impacts multiple aspects of development in Dataform,
such as the following:
Collaboration
Codebase readability
Development processes
Workflow compilation
Workflow execution
Dataform enforces
API quotas and limits on compilation resources .
A large repository size can cause your repository to exceed these quotas
and limits. This can lead to the failed compilation and execution of your
workflow.
To mitigate that risk, we recommend splitting large repositories.
When you split a large repository, you divide a large workflow into a
number of smaller workflows housed in different repositories and connected
by cross-repository dependencies.
This approach lets you adhere to Dataform quotas and limits,
implement fine-grained processes and permissions, and improve codebase
readability and collaboration. However, managing split repositories can be more
challenging than managing a single repository.
To learn more about the impact of repository size in Dataform, see
Overview of repository size .
To learn more about best practices for splitting repositories, see
Splitting repositories .
Best practices for repository structure
We recommend structuring files in the definitions directory to reflect the
stages of your workflow. Keep in mind that you can adopt a custom structure
that best fits your needs.
The following recommended structure of definitions subdirectories reflects
the key stages of most workflows:
sources for storing data source declarations.
intermediate for storing data transformation logic.
output for storing definitions of output tables.
extras (optional) for storing additional files.
The names of all the files in Dataform must conform to
BigQuery table naming guidelines. We recommend that the names of files
in the definitions directory in a Dataform repository reflect
the subdirectory structure.
To learn more about best practices for structuring and naming files in a
repository, see
Structuring code in a repository .
Best practices for code lifecycle
The default code lifecycle in Dataform consists of the following phases:
Development of workflow code in Dataform workspaces.
You can develop with
Dataform core
or
exclusively with JavaScript .
Compilation of your code into a
compilation result
using settings from your
workflow settings file .
You can configure custom compilation results with
release configurations and workspace compilation overrides.
With
release configurations ,
you can configure custom compilation results of your whole repository. You
can later schedule their execution in
workflow configurations .
With workspace compilation overrides ,
you can configure compilation overrides for all the workspaces in your
repository, creating custom compilation results of each workspace.
Execution of the compilation result in BigQuery.
You can schedule executions or repository compilation results with
workflow configurations .
To manage code lifecycle in Dataform, you can create execution
environments such as development, staging, and production.
To learn more about code lifecycle in Dataform, see
Introduction to code lifecycle in Dataform .
You can select to keep your execution environments in a single repository,
or in multiple repositories.
Execution environments in a single repository
You can create isolated execution environments such as development, staging, and
production in a single Dataform repository with
workspace compilation overrides
and
release configurations .
You can create isolated execution environments the following ways:
Split development and production tables by schema.
Split development and production tables by schema and Google Cloud project.
Split development, staging, and production tables by Google Cloud project.
Then, you can schedule executions in staging and production environments with
workflow configurations .
We recommend triggering executions manually in the development environment.
To learn more about best practices for managing the workflow lifecycle in
Dataform, see
Best practices for the workflow lifecycle .
Code lifecycle in multiple repositories
To tailor
Identity and Access Management permissions
to each stage of the code lifecycle, you can create multiple copies of a
repository and store them in different Google Cloud projects.
Each Google Cloud project serves as an execution environment that corresponds
to a stage of your code lifecycle—for example, development and production.
In this approach, we recommend keeping the codebase of the repository the same
in all projects. To customize compilation and execution in each copy of the
repository, use
workspace compilation overrides ,
release configurations ,
and
workflow configurations .
Overview of repository size
This section helps you understand how repository size impacts workflow
development and Dataform compilation resources usage, and how to
estimate the compilation resources usage of your repository.
About repository size in Dataform
The size of a repository impacts the following aspects of development
in Dataform:
Collaboration. Multiple collaborators working on a large repository can
create an excessive number of pull requests, increasing the risk of merge conflicts.
Codebase readability. A larger number of files that make up a workflow in
a single repository can make it difficult to navigate through the repository.
Development processes. Some areas of a large workflow in a single
repository might require custom permissions or processes, such as scheduling,
that are different from the permissions and processes applied to the rest of the
workflow. A large repository size makes it difficult to tailor development processes
to specific areas of the workflow.
Workflow compilation. Dataform enforces
usage limits on compilation resources . A large
repository size can lead to exceeding these limits, causing the
compilation to fail.
Workflow execution. During execution, Dataform runs
repository code inside your workspace and deploys assets to
BigQuery. The larger the repository, the more time it takes
Dataform to run it.
If the large size of your repository negatively impacts your development in
Dataform, you can
split the repository into multiple smaller repositories.
About repository compilation resource limits
During development, Dataform compiles all the repository code inside your
workspace to generate a representation of the workflow in your repository.
This is called a compilation result . Dataform enforces usage limits on
compilation resources.
Your repository might exceed the usage limits for the following reasons:
An infinite loop bug in the repository code.
A memory leak bug in the repository code.
A large repository size, approximately more than 1000 workflow actions.
Tip:
Update
Dataform core
to the latest version to lower the risk of exceeding compilation limits.
For more information on usage limits on compilation resources, see
Dataform compilation resource limits .
Estimate the compilation resource usage of your repository
You can estimate usage of the following compilation resources for your
repository:
CPU time usage.
Wall time usage.
Maximum total serialized data size of the generated graph of actions defined
in your repository.
To obtain a rough approximation of the current compilation time usage for
the compilation of your repository, you can time the compilation of your
Dataform workflow on a local Linux or macOS machine.
To time the compilation of your workflow, inside your repository, run
the Dataform CLI command dataform compile in the following format:
time dataform compile
The following code sample shows a result of executing the
time dataform compile command:
real 0m3.480s
user 0m1.828s
sys 0m0.260s
You can treat the real result as a rough indicator of the wall time usage and the user result as a rough indicator of the CPU time usage for
the compilation of your repository.
To obtain a rough approximation of the total size of the generated graph of
actions in your repository, you can write the output of the graph to a JSON file.
You can treat the size of the uncompressed JSON file as a rough indicator of the
total graph size.
To write the output of the compiled graph of your workflow to a JSON file,
inside your repository, run the following Dataform CLI command:
dataform compile --json > graph.json
Splitting repositories
This section discusses strategies for splitting a Dataform repository
and managing cross-repository dependencies.
Repositories are the core units in Dataform. A repository stores all
the SQLX and JavaScript files that make up your workflow, as well as the
Dataform configuration files and packages. You can store a workflow
in a single repository, or split a workflow between multiple repositories.
Splitting a repository in Dataform comes with the following
advantages:
Adhering to
Dataform compilation resource limits .
Splitting a large workflow into multiple smaller repositories lowers the
risk of exceeding Dataform limits on compilation resources.
Fine-graining processes. You can set processes, such as continuous integration
(CI) rules, individually for each split fragment of your workflow and the
team developing it.
Fine-graining permissions. You can set permissions individually for each split
fragment of your workflow and the team developing it to enhance the overall
security of the workflow.
Improving collaboration by minimizing the number of collaborators working on
each split fragment of your workflow.
Improving codebase readability. Splitting the files that make up a large
workflow into multiple repositories makes it easier to navigate each
repository individually than to navigate the entire workflow at once.
Speeding up the workflow execution of each split fragment of your workflow
in comparison to the execution of the entire workflow.
Splitting a repository in Dataform comes with the following downsides:
Custom continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) configuration
required for each Dataform repository and its corresponding Git
repository.
Custom scheduling configuration required for each Dataform repository
and its corresponding Git repository.
Difficulty in managing dependencies between the objects of your workflow housed
in multiple repositories.
Lack of comprehensive directed acyclic graph (DAG) visualization of the SQL
workflow split between multiple repositories. In each repository, the generated
DAG represents only a portion of the complete workflow.
Strategies for splitting a repository
When you split a repository, you divide the files that make up a parent SQL
workflow into smaller child workflows housed in separate
Dataform repositories.
You might choose to split a repository in one of the following ways:
One repository per development team.
One repository per domain—for example, sales, marketing, or logistics.
One central repository and one repository per domain that uses the contents of
the central repository as data sources.
To house the parent workflow in a third-party Git hosting platform, you
need to individually connect each of the separate repositories containing child
workflows to a dedicated third-party Git repository.
Managing cross-repository dependencies
The most efficient way to split a repository is to divide the parent SQL
workflow into self-contained child workflows, creating independent
repositories. An independent repository does not use the contents of a different
repository as a data source. This approach does not require managing
cross-repository dependencies.
When you cannot avoid cross-repository dependencies, you can manage them by
splitting a repository into a succession of repositories, in which a
repository depends on its predecessor and is a data source for its successor.
The succession of repositories and their dependencies must best reflect the
structure of your parent workflow.
You can create dependencies between repositories with
Dataform data source declarations .
You can declare a BigQuery table type
from a different Dataform repository as a data source in the
repository being edited. After you declare a data source, you can reference it
like any other Dataform workflow action and use it to develop your
workflow.
When you schedule the execution of a workflow split between
repositories with cross-repository dependencies, you must run the
repositories one by one in the order of cross-repository dependencies.
We recommend avoiding splitting a repository into a group of repositories with
two-way dependencies. A two-way dependency between repositories occurs when a
repository is a data source for a different repository and also uses that
repository as a data source. Two-way dependencies between repositories
complicate the scheduling and execution of the parent workflow, as well as
development processes.
Structuring code in a repository
This section describes best practices for structuring and naming workflow
files in the root definitions directory of a Dataform repository. The
recommended structure of the definitions directory reflects the stages
of a workflow. You can adopt any structure that fits your business needs.
You might want to structure the workflow code in the definitions directory
for the following reasons:
Improving collaboration on the codebase by designating teams to selected
parts of your workflow.
Improving maintainability of the workflow in case of organizational
changes.
Improving navigation through your codebase.
Improving scalability of the codebase.
Minimizing administrative overhead for your team.
Recommended structure of the definitions directory
The root definitions directory in a Dataform repository
contains code that creates elements of your workflow. You can organize
files in the definitions directory into a structure of directories
that reflects the structure of the workflow.
When you develop a workflow, you declare source tables and transform them to
create output tables that you can use for business or analytics purposes.
You can distinguish three key stages of a workflow:
Declaration of data sources.
Transformation of source data.
Definition of output tables from the transformed source data.
The following structure of subdirectories in the definitions directory
reflects the key stages of a workflow:
sources
Data source declarations and basic transformation of source data—for
example, filtering.
intermediate
Tables and actions that read from sources and transform data before
you use the transformed data to define outputs tables. Tables typically not
exposed to additional processes or tools, such as business intelligence (BI)
tools, after Dataform runs them to BigQuery.
outputs
Definitions of tables consumed by processes or tools, such as BI,
after Dataform runs them in BigQuery.
extra
Files outside of the main pipeline of your workflow—for example,
files that contain workflow data prepared for additional use,
like machine learning. An optional and custom subdirectory.
Best practices for sources
The sources subdirectory contains the first stage of your workflow:
the declaration and basic transformation of source data.
In the sources subdirectory, store data source declarations and tables
that filter, categorize, cast, or rename columns.
Avoid storing tables that combine data from multiple sources.
Transform sources data in tables stored in the intermediate subdirectory.
If you declare data sources from multiple pools—for example, Google Ads
or Google Analytics—dedicate a subdirectory to each pool.
The following sample shows a subdirectory structure of sources with two
source pools:
definitions/
sources/
google_ads/
google_ads_filtered.sqlx
google_ads_criteria_metrics.sqlx
google_ads_criteria_metrics_filtered.sqlx
google_ads_labels.sqlx
google_ads_labels_filtered.sqlx
google_analytics/
google_analytics_users.sqlx
google_analytics_users_filtered.sqlx
google_analytics_sessions.sqlx
If you declare multiple data source tables within the same schema, you can
consolidate their declarations into a single JavaScript file.
For more information about creating data source declarations with JavaScript,
see
Create workflows exclusively with JavaScript .
The following code sample shows multiple data sources within one schema,
declared in a single JavaScript file:
[
"source_table_1" ,
"source_table_2" ,
"source_table_3"
]. forEach (( name ) = >
declare ({
database : "gcp_project" ,
schema : "source_dataset" ,
name ,
})
);
To protect your workflow against data source changes, you can create a view
for each data source declaration—for example, analytics_users_filtered.sqlx .
The view can contain the basic filtering and formatting of the source data.
Store the views in the sources subdirectory.
Then, when you create intermediate or outputs tables, reference the views
instead of raw source tables. This approach lets you test the source tables.
In case a source table changes, you can modify its view—for example,
by adding filters or recasting data.
Best practices for intermediate
The intermediate subdirectory contains the second stage of your workflow:
the transformation and aggregation of the source data from one or multiple
sources.
In the intermediate subdirectory, store files that significantly transform
source data from one or multiple sources in the sources subdirectory—for
example, tables that join data. Tables in the intermediate subdirectory
typically query data from source tables or other intermediate tables.
Use intermediate tables to create outputs tables. Typically, intermediate
tables are not used for additional purposes—for example, data analytics—after
Dataform runs them to BigQuery. You can think of
intermediate tables as the data transformation logic that enables the creation
of output tables.
We recommend that you
document and
test all intermediate tables.
Best practices for outputs
The outputs subdirectory contains the final stage of your workflow:
the creation of output tables for your business purposes from the transformed
data.
In the outputs directory, store tables that you plan to use in additional
processes or tools after Dataform runs them to
BigQuery—for example, reports or dashboards. Tables in the
outputs directory typically query data from the intermediate tables.
Group outputs tables by the business entity they are related to, for
example—marketing, orders, or analytics. Dedicate a subdirectory to each business
entity.
To store output tables separately in BigQuery, you can configure a
dedicated schema for output tables. For instructions to configure table schema,
see
Override table settings .
The following sample shows a subdirectory structure of outputs
with sales and marketing business entities:
definitions/
outputs/
orders/
orders.sqlx
returns.sqlx
sales/
sales.sqlx
revenue.sqlx
marketing/
campaigns.sqlx
We recommend that you
document and
test all outputs tables.
Naming strategy
The names of all the files in Dataform must conform to
BigQuery table naming guidelines .
We recommend that the names of the files in the definitions directory
in a Dataform repository reflect the subdirectory structure.
In the sources subdirectory, the filenames should point to the source
that the file is related to. Add the name of the source as a prefix to the
filenames—for example, analytics_filtered.sqlx
In the intermediate subdirectory, the filenames should identify the
subdirectory, so that collaborators can clearly distinguish intermediate files.
Select a unique prefix and apply it only to files in the intermediate
directory—for example, stg_ads_concept.sqlx .
In the outputs subdirectory, the filenames should be concise—for example,
orders.sqlx . If you have outputs tables with the same names in
different entity subdirectories, add a prefix that identifies the entity
—for example, sales_revenue.sqlx or ads_revenue.sqlx .
The following example shows a subdirectory structure inside the definitions
directory with filenames that conform to the recommended naming strategy:
definitions/
sources/
google_analytics.sqlx
google_analytics_filtered.sqlx
intermediate/
stg_analytics_concept.sqlx
outputs/
customers.sqlx
sales/
sales.sqlx
sales_revenue.sqlx
ads/
campaigns.sqlx
ads_revenue.sqlx
