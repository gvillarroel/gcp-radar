Use JavaScript in Dataform
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document helps you understand how you can use JavaScript
to develop workflows in Dataform. This document also shows you how to
use JavaScript to create workflow actions and how to create JavaScript
includes to reuse code in Dataform.
Dataform core
lets you create workflow actions with SQLX and JavaScript.
While optional, using JavaScript along with SQLX to create similar elements
repeatedly in your workflow. For example, with JavaScript you can create a
view of each table in your workflow with certain user IDs removed.
You can also develop workflow actions exclusively with JavaScript.
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Dataform page.
Go to Dataform
Select or create a repository .
Select or create a development workspace .
Additionally, you must be familiar with
JavaScript syntax
and the following JavaScript concepts:
Variables
Arrays
Conditional statements
For loops
Maps
Functions
Objects
Exporting and importing modules
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to develop a workflow with JavaScript and reuse code with JavaScript includes,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Dataform Editor ( roles/dataform.editor )
IAM role on workspaces.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Add JavaScript code to a SQLX file
You can add JavaScript code to a SQLX file in two ways:
inline or inside a JavaScript block.
You can use a JavaScript block to define functions or constants in a SQLX file.
You can use inline JavaScript to dynamically modify a SQLX or SQL query.
The following code sample shows the self Dataform core built-in
JavaScript function added inline to the post_operations block in a SQLX file:
config {type: "table"}
SELECT * FROM ...
post_operations {
GRANT `roles/bigquery.dataViewer`
ON
TABLE ${self()}
TO "group:allusers@example.com", "user:otheruser@example.com"
}
The following code sample shows a constant defined in a JavaScript block and
used inline inside a query in a SQLX file:
js {
const columnName = "foo" ;
}
SELECT 1 AS $ { columnName } FROM "..."
Reuse code across a single SQLX file with JavaScript encapsulation
You can reuse JavaScript code to streamline development in Dataform.
To reuse JavaScript constants and functions across a single SQLX file,
you can encapsulate them in a JavaScript block. To reuse JavaScript code
across a single Dataform repository, you can create includes.
To reuse JavaScript code across multiple Dataform repositories,
you can create or import a package.
To create repetitive parts of SQL code that you can reuse within
a single SQLX file, you can encapsulate functions and constants in
a JavaScript block. You can reuse code defined in a JavaScript block only
inside the SQLX file where the block is defined. For more information,
see Dataform core .
The following code sample shows a constant and function defined in a
JavaScript block and used inline inside a query in a SQLX file:
js {
const foo = 1 ;
function bar ( number ){
return number + 1 ;
}
}
select
$ { foo } as one ,
$ { bar ( foo )} as two
Reuse code across a single repository with includes
Includes are JavaScript constants or functions global to your repository.
You define includes in the includes directory of your repository. You can then
reuse them across your repository in JavaScript and SQLX files.
The following code sample shows the definition of the launch_date constant
in the includes/constants.js file:
// filename is includes/constants.js
const launch_date = "11.11.2011" ;
module . exports = { launch_date };
The following code sample shows the launch_date constant referenced in a table
definition query in a SQLX file:
config { type : "table" }
SELECT * FROM source_table WHERE date > $ { constants . launch_date }
Create a JavaScript file for includes
To create a new JavaScript file in the includes/ directory, follow these
steps:
In the Files pane, next to includes/ , click
more_vert More .
Click Create file .
In the Create new file pane, do the following:
In the Add a file path field, after includes/ , enter the name of
the file followed by .js . For example, includes/constants.js .
Filenames can only include numbers, letters, hyphens, and underscores.
Click Create file .
Create a JavaScript constant
To create a constant that you can reuse across your project, follow these steps:
Go to your development workspace.
In the Files pane, expand includes/ .
Create or select a JavaScript file with the .js extension.
In the file, enter the following code snippet:
const CONSTANT_NAME = CONSTANT_VALUE ;
module . exports = { CONSTANT_NAME };
Replace the following:
CONSTANT_NAME : the name of your constant
CONSTANT_VALUE : the value of your constant
Optional: Click Format .
The following code sample defines the PROJECT_ID constant in the
includes/constants.js file:
// filename is includes/constants.js
const PROJECT_ID = "my_project_name" ;
module . exports = { PROJECT_ID };
The following code sample references the PROJECT_ID constant in a table
definition query in a SQLX file:
config { type : "table" }
SELECT * FROM $ { constants . PROJECT_ID }. my_schema_name . my_table_name
The following code sample shows the previous
Dataform core table definition query compiled into SQL:
SELECT * FROM my_project_name . my_schema_name . my_table_name
Create a custom JavaScript function
To create a custom JavaScript function that you can reuse across your project,
follow these steps:
Go to your development workspace.
In the Files pane, expand includes/ .
Create or select a JavaScript file with the .js extension.
In the file, write your custom JavaScript function.
In the file, enter the following code snippet:
module . exports = { FUNCTION_NAME }
Replace FUNCTION_NAME with the name of your function.
Optional: Click Format .
The following code sample shows a custom JavaScript function that is called
renderScript and stored in the includes/functions.js file. The function
generates a SQL script:
function renderScript ( table , dimensions , metrics ) {
return `
select
${ dimensions . map ( field = > ` ${ field } as ${ field } ` ). join ( "," ) } ,
${ metrics . map ( field = > `sum( ${ field } ) as ${ field } ` ). join ( ",\n" ) }
from ${ table }
group by ${ dimensions . map (( field , i ) = > ` ${ i + 1 } ` ). join ( ", " ) }
` ;
}
module . exports = { renderScript };
The following code sample shows the use of the custom renderScript JavaScript
function in a Dataform core table definition query:
config {
type: "table",
tags: ["advanced", "hourly"],
disabled: true
}
${functions.renderScript(ref("source_table"),
["country", "device_type"],
["revenue", "pageviews", "sessions"]
)}
The following code sample shows the previous Dataform core table
definition query compiled into SQL:
select
country as country,
device_type as device_type,
sum(revenue) as revenue,
sum(pageviews) as pageviews,
sum(sessions) as sessions
from "dataform"."source_table"
group by 1, 2
Reference an include in a SQLX file
You can reference any include function or constant inside a SQLX file. The
syntax for referencing includes depends on the location of the include file.
A top-level includes file is located directly in the includes/ directory.
A nested includes file is located in a subdirectory of includes/ .
Reference a top-level include in a SQLX file
To reference a top-level include function or constant in a
Dataform core query, enter the include definition filename without
the .js extension followed by the name of the exported object.
The following code sample references the firstDate constant, defined in the
includes/constants.js file, in a table definition SQLX file:
config {type: "table"}
select * from source_table where date > ${constants.firstDate}
Reference a nested include in a SQLX file
To reference includes located in subdirectories of definitions , import
includes by using the JavaScript require function and a js {} block.
To reference a nested include with the require JavaScript function,
follow these steps:
Go to your development workspace.
In the Files pane, expand definitions/ .
Select a SQLX file.
In the config block, enter the following code snippet:
js {
var { VARIABLE_NAME } = require ( " SUBDIRECTORY_INCLUDE " );
}
Replace the following:
VARIABLE_NAME : the name of the constant
or function that you want to import
SUBDIRECTORY_INCLUDE : the path
of the nested includes file
Optional: Click Format .
The following code sample references the firstDate constant, defined in the
nested includes/allConstants/constants.js file, in a table definition SQLX
file:
config { type : "table" }
js {
var { firstDate } = require ( "includes/allConstants/constants" );
}
select * from source_table where date > $ { firstDate }
Use a JavaScript include function with the Dataform core ref function
To use a JavaScript include function with the Dataform core ref
function, you need to pass ref as an argument of the JavaScript include
function inside a SQLX file.
The following code sample shows the includes/script_builder.js file with
the renderScript JavaScript function that aggregates metrics by using SUM
and groups them by dimension:
function renderScript ( table , dimensions , metrics ) {
return `
SELECT
${ dimensions . map (( field ) = > ` ${ field } AS ${ field } ` ). join ( ",\\n" ) } ,
${ metrics . map (( field ) = > `SUM( ${ field } ) AS ${ field } ` ). join ( ",\\n" ) }
FROM ${ table }
GROUP BY ${ dimensions . map (( field , i ) = > ` ${ i + 1 } ` ). join ( ", " ) }
` ;
}
module . exports = { renderScript };
The following code sample shows the renderScript JavaScript function used in
the definitions/stats_per_country_and_device.sqlx file with the
Dataform core ref function passed as an argument:
$ { script_builder . renderScript (
ref ( "source_table" ),
[ "country" , "device_type" ],
[ "revenue" , "pageviews" , "sessions" ])}
The following code sample shows the
definitions/stats_per_country_and_device.sqlx query compiled to SQL:
SELECT country AS country,
device_type AS device_type,
SUM(revenue) AS revenue,
SUM(pageviews) AS pageviews,
SUM(sessions) AS sessions
FROM my_schema.source_table
GROUP BY 1, 2
For more information about the Dataform core ref function, see
Dataform core .
Reuse code across multiple repositories with packages
Packages are collections of JavaScript code that you can import and use across
multiple Dataform repositories to streamline workflow development.
You can create your own custom package in
Dataform or use one of the open-source Dataform packages,
available on the
GitHub open-source Dataform page .
To be able to use the contents of a package in Dataform, you need to
install the package in your Dataform repository, and then import it to
the individual JavaScript or SQLX file in which you want to use the package.
For more information, see Install a package .
To be able to install a private NPM package in a Dataform repository,
you need to authenticate the package .
Create workflows exclusively with JavaScript
This section shows you how to use JavaScript to create workflow actions in
Dataform. You might want to use JavaScript instead of
Dataform core to create similar elements repeatedly in your workflow.
As an alternative to developing workflows in SQLX, or SQLX combined with
JavaScript, you can create workflow actions in .js files by using only
JavaScript. You can create multiple workflow actions within one JavaScript
file with Dataform global methods and arbitrary JavaScript ES5 code,
such as loops and constants. Each of the Dataform global JavaScript
methods contain properties you can use to configure the created objects.
You can create the following workflow actions by using only JavaScript in
Dataform:
Data source declarations
Tables
Manual assertions
Custom SQL operations
With JavaScript, you can create similar actions repeatedly in your workflow. For
example, you can create a view of each table in your workflow with certain user
IDs removed.
The following JavaScript code sample lets you create a view of each table where
the value of the user_id field does not correspond to one of the values in the
blocked_user_ids list:
const tableNames = [ "user_events" , "user_settings" , "user_logs" ];
tableNames . forEach ( tableName = > {
publish ( tableName + "_blocked_removed" ). query (
ctx = > `
SELECT * FROM ${ ctx . ref ( tableName ) }
WHERE user_id NOT IN (
SELECT user_id
FROM ${ ctx . ref ( "blocked_user_ids" ) }
)`
);
});
This code sample creates three views named
user_events_blocked_removed , user_settings_blocked_removed , and
user_logs_blocked_removed that don't contain any of the blocked user IDs.
You can create multiple actions within one JavaScript file with
Dataform global methods and arbitrary JavaScript ES5 code, such
as loops and constants.
You can define the following actions with JavaScript in Dataform:
Tables
Data source declarations
Assertions
Custom SQL operations
Create a JavaScript file
Store JavaScript files for definitions and data source declarations in the
definitions/ directory. To create a new JavaScript file in the definitions/
directory, follow these steps:
In the Files pane, next to definitions/ , click
more_vert More .
Click Create file .
In the Create new file pane, do the following:
In the Add a file path field, after definitions/ , enter the name
of the file followed by .js . For example,
definitions/definitions.js .
Filenames can only include numbers, letters, hyphens, and underscores.
Click Create file .
Set workflow action properties with JavaScript
You can use the following Dataform global methods to create SQL
workflow actions with Dataform:
declare . Used to declare a data source.
publish . Used to define a table.
assert . Used to create an assertion.
operate . Used to define a custom SQL operation.
Each of the global methods contain properties you can use to configure the
created object. For more information on global methods and their properties, see
the Dataform core reference .
In the publish() method that creates a table, you can set table properties
by passing them as the second method argument.
To pass table properties as the second argument of publish() ,
follow these steps:
In your development workspace, in the Files pane, expand definitions/ .
Select a JavaScript file.
In the file, add table properties to the publish() method
in the following format:
method ( "first_method_argument" , {
property1 : "property1_value" ,
property2 : "property2_value" ,
property3 : "property3_value" ,
});
Optional: Click Format .
The following code sample shows how to set properties to the publish() method
by passing the properties as a second argument of the method:
publish ( "table1" , {
type : "table" ,
dependencies : [ "other_table" ],
description : {
"Value is 1"
}
}). query ( ctx = > "SELECT 1 AS test" );
Reference includes in a JavaScript file
You can reference any includes function, macro, or constant inside a JavaScript
file. For more information on includes in Dataform, see the
Reuse code across a single repository with includes
section of this document.
The syntax for referencing includes inside a JavaScript file depends on the
location of the include file. Dataform stores such files in the
includes directory.
Reference top-level includes
To reference a top-level includes file, reference the filename when
declaring your variables.
The following code sample references the serviceName and serviceId
variables from the includes/service.js file:
const { serviceName , serviceId } = service ;
Reference nested includes
To reference a nested includes file, enter the filename in the JavaScript
require function.
The following code sample references the serviceName and serviceId
variables from the includes/allServices/service.js file:
const { serviceName , serviceId } = require ( "includes/allServices/service.js" );
Use Dataform query functions in JavaScript methods
Dataform provides a number of built-in functions that you can use
inside queries, such as ref and self . For more information on
Dataform built-in functions, see the
Dataform API reference .
To use a built-in query function in a JavaScript method, follow these steps:
In your development workspace, in the Files pane, expand definitions/ .
Select a JavaScript file.
In the file, enter a global Dataform JavaScript method.
In the method, enter a contextable ctx argument.
Optional: If you are using JavaScript template strings, wrap the
contextable argument in backticks `` .
In the contextable argument, enter the query function with its parameter as
a context object.
Optional: Click Format .
The following code sample shows the ref query function wrapped inside a
contextable argument of the publish method:
publish ( "example" ). query ( ctx = > `SELECT * FROM ${ ctx . ref ( "other_table" ) } ` );
Declare a workflow data source with JavaScript
You can declare multiple data sources in one JavaScript declaration file with
the Dataform declare JavaScript method. For more information on
the declare method, see the Dataform core reference . For more
information on data sources in Dataform, see
Declare a data source .
To declare a data source in a JavaScript file, follow these steps:
In your development workspace, in the Files pane, expand definitions/ .
Select a JavaScript file.
In the file, enter the following code snippet:
declare ({
database : " DATABASE_PROJECT_ID " ,
schema : " BIGQUERY_SCHEMA " ,
name : " RELATION_NAME " ,
});
Replace the following:
DATABASE_PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the project which
contains the data source
BIGQUERY_SCHEMA : the BigQuery dataset in which the
external relation exists
RELATION_NAME : the name of the relation that you can later use
to reference the data source in Dataform
To declare another data source in the same file, add an extra declare
block to the file.
Optional: Click Format .
Define a table with JavaScript
You can create a table with the Dataform JavaScript publish
method. For more information on the publish method, see the
Dataform core reference .
You can define the following table types:
Table
Incremental table
View
For more information on defining tables in Dataform, see
Create tables .
To define a table in a JavaScript file, follow these steps:
In your development workspace, in the Files pane, expand definitions/ .
Select a JavaScript file.
In the file, enter the following code snippet:
publish ( " TABLE_NAME " ). query ( ctx = > " SELECT_QUERY " );
Replace the following:
TABLE_NAME : the name of the table
SELECT_QUERY : a SQL SELECT statement defining the
table
To set the table type, add table dependencies, and add table description,
set object properties of the publish method.
To define another table in the same file, repeat step 3 and step 4.
Optional: Click Format .
Define manual assertions with JavaScript
You can create manual SQL assertions in a JavaScript file with the
Dataform assert JavaScript method. For more information on the
assert method, see the Dataform core reference .
A manual assertion SQL query must return zero rows. If the query returns rows
when run, the assertion fails. You can create multiple assertions in one
JavaScript file.
For more information on assertions in Dataform, see
Test data quality .
To create a manual assertion in a JavaScript file, follow these steps:
In your development workspace, in the Files pane, expand definitions/ .
Select a JavaScript file.
In the file, enter the following code snippet:
assert ( " ASSERTION_NAME " ). query ( ctx = > " CUSTOM_ASSERTION_QUERY " );
Replace the following:
ASSERTION_NAME : the name for your custom assertion
CUSTOM_ASSERTION_QUERY : your SQL assertion query
To create another assertion in the same file, repeat step 3.
Optional: Click Format .
The following code sample shows a JavaScript assertion that asserts that no
value in source_table is NULL :
assert ( "assertion1" ). query ( ctx = > "SELECT * FROM source_table WHERE value IS NULL" );
Define custom SQL operations with JavaScript
You can define custom SQL operations in a JavaScript file with the
Dataform operate JavaScript method. For more information on
custom SQL operations in Dataform, see
Create operations .
To define a custom SQL operation with JavaScript, follow these steps:
In your development workspace, in the Files pane, expand definitions/ .
Select a JavaScript file.
In the file, enter the following code snippet:
operate ( " OPERATION_NAME " ). queries ( ctx = > " CUSTOM_SQL_QUERY " );
Replace the following:
OPERATION_NAME : the name for the custom operation
CUSTOM_SQL_QUERY : your custom SQL query
To define another custom SQL operation in the same file, repeat step 3.
Optional: Click Format .
The following code sample shows a custom SQL operation in a JavaScript file that
inserts a single new row into some_table and sets test_column of the new row
to 2 :
operate ( "operation1" ). queries ( "INSERT INTO some_table (test_column) VALUES (2)" );
