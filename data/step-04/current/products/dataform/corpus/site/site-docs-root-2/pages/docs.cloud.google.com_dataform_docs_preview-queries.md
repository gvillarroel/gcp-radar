Preview SQL queries
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows you how to preview output of a SQL query in a
Dataform workspace before executing the query to BigQuery.
About query preview in Dataform
When you develop a query in a SQLX or JavaScript file with
Dataform core ,
Dataform compiles the query to SQL in real-time. To test the output of
the compiled SQL query before you run it to BigQuery, you can preview
the query in your Dataform workspace.
When you preview a query, Dataform runs a job in
BigQuery to run your compiled query in a temporary destination
table and display query results in your workspace. You can inspect the output of
the query before you trigger execution to publish your table to
BigQuery. The temporary table with the previewed query is automatically
deleted in up to 24 hours. For more information about BigQuery jobs,
see
Manage jobs .
Warning: Clicking Run to preview a query doesn't execute code within the
pre_operations or post_operations blocks. Furthermore, any dependencies—for
example, temporary tables—created within the pre_operations or
post_operations blocks aren't available during the preview. Errors might occur
in the main query body if it relies on these missing dependencies.
Running query preview in Dataform incurs billing in BigQuery.
For more information about BigQuery pricing, see
BigQuery pricing .
During query preview, Dataform uses your Google Account user
credentials to run jobs in BigQuery. During workflow execution,
strict act-as mode
requires Dataform to use a custom service account or Google Account
user credentials to create or update assets in BigQuery.
Dataform displays results of all queries previewed during the current
browser session in the Query results panel in your workspace. In the Query
results panel, you can view the following information about each query
previewed during the current browser session:
Job information
BigQuery job ID
User running the preview
Location where the job runs, taken from your
workflow settings file
Creation, start, and end times of the BigQuery job
Duration of the BigQuery job
Bytes processed
Bytes billed in BigQuery
Job priority
Use of legacy SQL
in the query
Temporary destination table of the query
Results of the query
JSON representation of the query output
Moreover, in the Query results panel, you can navigate to the source file of
each previewed query, and navigate to BigQuery Studio to view the preview
job.
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Dataform page.
Go to Dataform
Select or create a repository .
Select or create a development workspace .
Create a SQL query, for example,
create a table .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to preview queries,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Dataform Editor ( roles/dataform.editor )
on workspaces
BigQuery Job User ( roles/bigquery.jobUser )
on the project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Preview a query
To inspect query results in Dataform before execution, run a preview
of a query in your workspace. If the file you edit contains multiple queries,
select the query that you want to preview. You can preview one query at a time.
Running a preview is a little different for tables with assertions. For more
information, see
Preview a table with assertions .
To preview a SQL query and view query results in a Dataform
workspace, follow these steps:
In the Files pane, expand definitions/ .
Select a SQLX or JavaScript file.
Click Run .
If the file contains multiple queries, in the menu, select the
query that you want to preview.
Inspect results of the preview in the Query results panel.
To inspect job details, select the Job information tab.
To inspect query results, select the Results tab.
To view the JSON output of the query, select the JSON tab.
To view the preview job in SQL workspace, click the
more_vert More menu >
View job in SQL workspace .
Preview a table with assertions
In a SQLX table definition file with assertions, you can preview the table
creation query and the defined assertion queries.
Dataform treats the table definition query as the default query. To
preview the table creation query, click Run in your workspace. To preview an
assertion query, select it in the menu next to the Run button. You can
preview one query at a time.
To preview a query in a table definition file with assertions in a
Dataform workspace, follow these steps:
In the Files pane, expand definitions/ .
Select a definition file of a table with assertions.
Run a preview:
To preview the table creation query, click Run .
To preview an assertion query, click the drop-down icon next to
Run , and then select the query that you want to preview.
Inspect results of the preview in the Query results panel.
To inspect job details, select the Job information tab.
To inspect query results, select the Results tab.
To view the JSON output of the query, select the JSON tab.
To view the preview job in SQL workspace, click the
more_vert More menu > View job in SQL workspace .
