Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to complete the tasks in this document,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Dataform Admin ( roles/dataform.admin )
IAM role on repositories.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
To enhance security for scheduling, see
Implement enhanced scheduling permissions .
To be able to update the release version of a release configuration for a
Dataform repository, you must grant the
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to the Dataform service
agent for every custom service account in the workflow configurations that are
using this release configuration. This permission is available in the
Service Account User role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ). For more information, see
Grant the required IAM roles .
Important: We recommend enabling
strict act-as mode
on existing repositories, as this helps to ensure a more secure and
predictable permissions model for your Dataform projects.
Introduction to the workflow lifecycle in Dataform
This section describes the workflow lifecycle in Dataform and
ways to configure compilation and execution within Dataform.
The Dataform workflow lifecycle consists of the following phases:
Development
You develop a workflow in a
Dataform workspace.
Compilation
Dataform compiles the workflow code in your workspace to SQL in
real time, creating a
compilation result
of the workspace that you can run in BigQuery. Dataform
uses the settings that you
define in your workflow settings file
to create the compilation result.
Dataform compilation is hermetic to ensure compilation consistency,
meaning that the same code compiles to the same SQL compilation result
every time. Dataform compiles your code in a sandbox
environment with no internet access. No additional actions, such as calling
external APIs, are available during compilation.
Execution
In a
workflow invocation ,
Dataform runs the workspace compilation result in BigQuery.
To tailor the Dataform workflow lifecycle to your needs, you can configure
the compilation result to influence where and how Dataform
runs your workflow. Then, you can manually trigger or schedule executions
to influence when Dataform runs your whole workflow or its
selected elements.
Ways to configure Dataform compilation
By default, Dataform uses settings in the
workflow settings file
to create compilation results. You can override the default settings
with compilation overrides to create custom compilation results. You can then
manually trigger an execution of a custom compilation result,
or schedule executions.
Dataform provides the following options for configuring
compilation results:
Workspace compilation overrides
You can configure compilation overrides that apply to all workspaces in a
repository. You can use workspace compilation overrides to create isolated
development environments.
Release configurations
You can create release configurations to configure templates for creating
compilation results of a Dataform repository. You can then create
a workflow configuration to schedule executions of compilation results created
in a selected release configuration.
Dataform API compilation overrides
You can pass Dataform API requests in the terminal to create and run a
single compilation result with compilation overrides.
Configure workspace compilation overrides
With
workspace compilation overrides ,
you can create compilation overrides for all workspaces in a
Dataform repository. You can create one configuration of
workspace compilation overrides for each repository.
When you manually trigger an execution in a workspace
in a repository with workspace compilation overrides, Dataform
applies these overrides to the compilation result of the workspace.
You can configure the following workspace compilation overrides:
Google Cloud project in which Dataform runs the contents of
the workspace
Table prefix
Schema suffix
You can use workspace compilation overrides to create isolated development
environments by isolating workspace compilation results in BigQuery
with dynamic compilation overrides. Dynamic table prefix
and schema suffix compilation overrides contain the ${workspaceName} variable.
When you trigger an execution in a workspace, Dataform replaces the
${workspaceName} variable with the name of the current workspace, creating
compilation overrides unique to the workspace.
Keep in mind that you cannot schedule executions of compilation results
created with workspace compilation overrides.
Create release configurations
With release configurations ,
you can configure templates of settings for creating
compilation results of repositories.
In a release configuration, you can configure compilation overrides of
workflow settings ,
compilation variables, and the frequency of creating compilation results of
your whole repository.
In a release configuration, you can configure the following
compilation overrides:
Google Cloud project
Table prefix
Schema suffix
Value of a
compilation variable
You can create multiple release configurations in a Dataform
repository, one for each stage of your development lifecycle, creating isolated
repository compilation results.
You can then
create workflow configurations to schedule executions
of compilation results created in a selected release configuration.
You can also manually
trigger the execution of a compilation result in a selected release configuration .
Configure a single compilation result with Dataform API compilation overrides
By passing Dataform API requests in the terminal, you can configure compilation
overrides for a single compilation result.
In the
compilationResults.create
request, you can create a single compilation result of a Dataform
workspace or a specified Git commitish.
In the
CodeCompilationConfig object
of the compilationResults.create request, you can configure compilation
overrides for the compilation request.
You can configure the following Dataform API compilation overrides:
Google Cloud project
Table prefix
Schema suffix
Value of a
compilation variable
Keep in mind that Dataform API compilation overrides apply to a single
compilation result and a single execution. You cannot use them to schedule
Dataform executions.
You can run a compilation result in the
workflowInvocations.create
request.
Ways to configure Dataform execution
Dataform provides the following options for configuring execution:
Manual execution in a workspace
You can manually trigger the instant execution of a workflow
in a Dataform workspace, outside of any schedule. You can run
selected actions in the workflow.
Workflow configurations
You can schedule executions of compilation results created in a selected
release configuration. You can select workflow actions to run, and
set the frequency and time zone of executions.
Trigger instant execution in a workspace
In a Dataform workspace, you can manually trigger the instant
execution of a workflow in your workspace, outside of any schedule.
You can manually run the following elements of the workflow in your
workspace:
All actions
Selected actions
Actions with selected tags
If your repository contains workspace compilation overrides, you can view what
compilation overrides Dataform will apply to the workspace
compilation result.
Create workflow configurations
With
workflow configurations ,
you can schedule executions of compilation results from a selected
release configuration .
You can create multiple workflow configurations in a Dataform
repository.
In a workflow configuration, you can configure the following execution settings:
Applied compilation release configuration.
Selection of workflow actions to be run.
Schedule and time zone of executions.
You can select the following workflow actions to be run:
All actions
Selected actions
Actions with selected tags
Then, during a scheduled execution of your workflow configuration,
Dataform deploys your selection of actions from the applied
compilation result to BigQuery.
Dataform release configurations and workflow configurations let you
configure compilation and schedule executions within Dataform,
without the need to rely on additional services.
Expiration of lifecycle resources
Dataform stores compilation results and workflow invocations for a
specific period of time.
Expiration of workflow invocations
Workflow invocations
expire after 90 days, or when you manually delete them.
In a
workflow configuration ,
you can view a list of most recent workflow invocations created by the configuration. When a workflow invocation created by a workflow
configuration expires, Dataform removes that workflow invocation
from the list of recent invocations.
Expiration of compilation results
The expiration of
compilation results
depends on whether they were created in a development workspace,
in a release configuration, or by a workflow invocation.
When you develop a workflow in a Dataform workspace,
Dataform compiles your code into a compilation result in real time
to provide query validation. Compilation results created this way expire
after 24 hours.
In a release configuration, the latest compilation result becomes the live
compilation result. A new compilation result replaces the current live
compilation result. Dataform retains the live compilation result
until it is replaced with a new compilation result. A replaced compilation
result expires in up to 24 hours.
Dataform removes expired compilation results from the list of
past compilation results on the Details page of a release configuration.
Dataform retains compilation results created by workflow invocations
for the whole life of the workflow invocation, up to 24 hours after workflow
invocation expires or is deleted.
Create workspace compilation overrides
This section shows you how to create workspace compilation overrides to isolate
tables and views created from your Dataform workspaces in
BigQuery. You can use workspace compilation overrides to create
isolated Dataform development environments.
When you develop workflow code in a Dataform workspace,
Dataform compiles the code in your workspace in real-time to create a
compilation result
of the workspace. Dataform uses settings defined in the
workflow settings file
to create the workspace compilation result. Then, when you
trigger execution
in a workspace, Dataform runs the workspace compilation result
in BigQuery.
To override the default settings set in
workflow settings
for all workspaces in your repository, you can create workspace compilation
overrides.
With workspace compilation overrides, you can override the following settings
for all workspaces in your repository:
Project
The Google Cloud project in which Dataform runs the
workspace compilation result, set in workflow_settings.yaml as
defaultProject or in dataform.json as defaultDatabase .
Note: The BigQuery job responsible for the execution is
created in the same Google Cloud project in which the
Dataform repository is present.
Table prefix
The custom prefix added to all the table names in all the workspaces in the
repository.
Schema suffix
The custom suffix appended to the schema of tables. Set as defaultDataset in
workflow_settings.yaml , defaultSchema in dataform.json , or in the
schema parameter in the config block of a table.
To create isolated development environments, you can isolate workspaces with
unique compilation overrides. You can dynamically modify the table prefix and
schema suffix compilation overrides with the ${workspaceName} variable.
When you manually trigger execution in a workspace, the ${workspaceName}
variable injects the name of the workspace into the workspace compilation
overrides.
When you set ${workspaceName} as the table prefix, Dataform
adds the name of the workspace to names of all tables in the workspace. After
execution, in BigQuery, you can identify which workspace a table
originates from.
When you set ${workspaceName} as the schema suffix, Dataform
appends the name of the workspace to defaultSchema , creating a custom schema
dedicated to the workspace. After execution, in BigQuery, you can
locate all the tables that are run from a specific workspace in the dedicated
schema.
Example of dynamic workspace compilation overrides
The following example shows dynamic workspace compilation overrides applied to a
repository that contains workspaces named after developers who work on the
repository: Sasha and Kai .
The goal of workspace compilation overrides in this example is to create
isolated development environments for Sasha and Kai.
The following default settings are set in workflow_settings.yaml :
defaultProject : analytics
defaultDataset : dataform
The following workspace compilation overrides create a dynamic table prefix and
schema suffix for each workspace in the repository:
Google Cloud Project ID : analytics_dev
Table prefix : ${workspaceName}
Schema suffix : ${workspaceName}
When Sasha manually triggers execution in the Sasha workspace,
Dataform runs its content with the following settings:
Google Cloud project: analytics_dev
Schema: dataform_sasha
Table names: sasha_ name , for example,
sasha_orders
When Kai manually triggers execution in the Kai workspace, Dataform
runs its content with the following settings:
Google Cloud project: analytics_dev
Schema: dataform_kai
Tables names: kai_ name , for example,
kai_orders
Create workspace compilation overrides
To create Dataform workspace compilation overrides, follow these
steps:
In your repository, go to Settings .
Click Edit .
In the Workspace compilation overrides pane, in the
Google Cloud Project ID field, enter the ID of the project.
In the Table prefix field, enter a prefix for all table names.
Optional: To create a dynamic table prefix that is unique for each
workspace, enter ${workspaceName} as the table prefix.
In the Schema suffix field, enter a suffix to append to the schema of
the created table or view.
Optional: To create a dynamic schema suffix that is unique for each
workspace, enter ${workspaceName} as the table suffix.
Click Save .
Dataform applies workspace compilation overrides to all the workspaces
in your repository.
Edit workspace compilation overrides
To edit Dataform workspace compilation overrides, follow these
steps:
In your repository, go to Settings .
Click Edit .
Edit workspace compilation overrides, and then click Save .
Delete workspace compilation overrides
To delete Dataform workspace compilation overrides, follow these
steps:
In your repository, go to Settings .
Click Edit .
In the Workspace compilation overrides pane, click Clear all , and
then click Save .
Configure compilation overrides with the Dataform API
This section shows you how to create and run a compilation result with
compilation overrides by using the Dataform API.
About Dataform API compilation overrides
To run your workflow, Dataform compiles your code to SQL to
create a
compilation result .
Then, during a
workflow invocation ,
Dataform runs the compilation result in BigQuery.
By default, Dataform uses the settings in the
workflow settings file
to create the compilation result. To isolate data run at different stages
of your development lifecycle, you can override the default settings with
compilation overrides.
By passing Dataform API requests in the terminal, you can create and run a
single compilation result with compilation overrides. You can create a
compilation result of a workspace or of a selected Git commitish.
To create a compilation result with compilation overrides, you need to raise the
Dataform API
compilationResults.create
request. In the request, you need to
specify a source , which should be a workspace or Git commitish,
for Dataform to compile into the compilation result. In the
CodeCompilationConfig object
of the compilationResults.create request, you can configure compilation
overrides.
You can then
run the created compilation result
in a Dataform API
workflowInvocations.create
request.
You can configure the following Dataform API compilation overrides:
Google Cloud project
The project in which Dataform runs the
compilation result, set in the workflow_settings.yaml file as the
defaultProject property or in the dataform.json file as
the defaultDatabase property.
Note: The BigQuery job responsible for the execution is
created in the same Google Cloud project in which the
Dataform repository is present.
Table prefix
The custom prefix added to all table names in the compilation result.
Schema suffix
The custom suffix appended to the schema of tables defined in
the defaultDataset property in the workflow_settings.yaml file, the
defaultSchema property in the dataform.json file, or in the schema
parameter in the config block of a table.
Value of a compilation variable
The value of a compilation variable to be used in the compilation result. You
can use compilation variables to run tables conditionally.
As an alternative to Dataform API compilation overrides that you can only use
for one compilation result, you can
configure workspace compilation overrides in the Google Cloud console .
To learn about alternative ways to configure compilation overrides in
Dataform, see
Introduction to the workflow lifecycle in Dataform .
Set a compilation result source
To raise the Dataform API
compilationResults.create
request, you need to specify a source for the compilation result.
You can set a Dataform workspace or a Git branch, Git tag, or Git
commit SHA as the source in the
compilationResults.create
request.
Set a workspace as a compilation result source
In the
compilationResults.create
request, populate the workspace property with the path of a selected
Dataform workspace in the following format:
{
"workspace": "projects/ PROJECT_NAME /locations/ LOCATION /repositories/ REPOSITORY_NAME /workspaces/ WORKSPACE_NAME "
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_NAME : the name of your Google Cloud project.
LOCATION : the location of your Dataform repository,
set in workflow settings.
REPOSITORY_NAME : the name of your Dataform
repository.
WORKSPACE_NAME : the name of your Dataform
workspace.
The following code sample shows the workspace property in the
compilationResults.create request set to a workspace called "sales-test" :
{
"workspace": "projects/analytics/locations/europe-west4/repositories/sales/workspaces/sales-test"
}
Set a Git commitish as a compilation result source
In the
compilationResults.create
request, populate the gitCommitish property with the selected Git branch,
tag, or commit SHA in the following format:
{
"gitCommitish": " GIT_COMMITISH "
}
Replace GIT_COMMITISH with the selected Git branch, Git tag, or a
Git commit SHA for the compilation result.
The following code sample shows the gitCommitish property in the
compilationResults.create request set to "staging" :
{
"gitCommitish": "staging"
}
Override the default project
To create staging or production tables in a Google Cloud project separate from
the project used for development, you can pass a different project
ID in the
CodeCompilationConfig object
in the Dataform API
compilationResults.create
request.
Passing a separate default project ID in the compilationResults.create request
overrides the default project ID configured in the
workflow settings file ,
but it does not override project IDs configured in individual
tables.
To override the default project ID, set the defaultDatabase
property to the selected project ID in the
CodeCompilationConfig object in the following format:
{
"codeCompilationConfig": {
"defaultDatabase": " PROJECT_NAME "
}
}
Replace PROJECT_NAME with the project ID that you want to set for
the compilation result.
Note: The BigQuery job responsible for the execution is
created in the same Google Cloud project in which the Dataform
repository is present.
Add a table prefix
To quickly identify tables from the compilation result, you can add a prefix to
all the table names in the compilation result by passing the table prefix in the
CodeCompilationConfig object
in the Dataform API
compilationResults.create request .
To add a table prefix, set the tablePrefix property in the
CodeCompilationConfig object in the following format:
{
"codeCompilationConfig": {
"tablePrefix": " PREFIX ",
}
}
Replace PREFIX with the prefix you want to append, for example,
staging .
For example, if your table name is table_name , Dataform
creates tables with the staging_table_name name.
Append a schema suffix
To separate development, staging, and production data, you can append a suffix
to schemas in a compilation result by passing the schema suffix in the
CodeCompilationConfig object
in the Dataform API
compilationResults.create request .
To append a schema suffix, set the schemaSuffix property in the
CodeCompilationConfig object in the following format:
{
"codeCompilationConfig": {
"schemaSuffix": " SUFFIX ",
}
}
Replace SUFFIX with the suffix you want to append, for example,
_staging .
For example, if your defaultDataset property in the
workflow_settings.yaml file is set to dataform , Dataform
creates tables in the dataform_staging schema.
Note: The CodeCompilationConfig schemaSuffix parameter overrides the schemas configured in the config block of individual files.
Run selected files conditionally with compilation variables
To run a selected table only in a specific execution setting, you can
create a compilation variable
for the execution setting and then pass its value in the
CodeCompilationConfig object
in the Dataform API
compilationResults.create request
.
To run a table conditionally in a specific execution setting by using the
Dataform API, follow these steps:
Create a compilation variable and add it to selected tables .
Set the YOUR_VARIABLE and VALUE key-value pair in the
codeCompilationConfig block of a
Dataform API compilation request in the
following format:
{
"codeCompilationConfig": {
"vars": {
" YOUR_VARIABLE ": " VALUE "
}
}
}
Replace YOUR_VARIABLE with the name of your variable, for example
executionSetting .
Replace VALUE with the value of the variable for this compilation
result that fulfills the
when condition set in the selected tables .
The following code sample shows the executionSetting variable passed to a
Dataform API compilation request:
{
"gitCommitish": "staging",
"codeCompilationConfig": {
"vars": {
"executionSetting": "staging"
}
}
}
Run a compilation result with compilation overrides
To run the compilation result created by a
compilationResults.create
request, pass the compilation result ID returned by the
compilationResults.create request in a
workflowInvocations.create
request.
The following code sample shows a compilation result ID passed in a
workflowInvocations.create
request:
{
"compilationResult": "projects/my-project-name/locations/europe-west4/repositories/my-repository-name/compilationResults/7646b4ed-ac8e-447f-93cf-63c43249ff11"
}
Create a release configuration
This section shows you how to create a release configuration in
Dataform to configure templates of compilation settings,
which you can run on a schedule. You can use release configurations to
configure execution environments, for example, staging and production.
To run workflows in BigQuery, Dataform compiles SQL
workflow code into a
compilation result .
This process happens automatically when you develop a workflow
in a Dataform workspace.
Release configurations let you customize compilation results. You can use them
to create execution environments, for example, staging.
Release configuration settings
In a release configuration, you can configure compilation overrides of
workflow settings ,
set compilation variables, and set the frequency
of creating compilation results.
A Dataform release configuration contains the following
compilation settings:
Release settings
The ID of the release, Git commitish for compilation results,
and frequency of creating compilation results. Frequency is an optional setting.
If set, the minimum frequency is 1 hour.
Compilation overrides
Overrides of the
Google Cloud project, table prefix, schema suffix, and
compilation variables
defined in
workflow settings .
How a release configuration works
Dataform creates compilation results from a release configuration at
the specified frequency, or when you trigger compilation. Frequency is an
optional setting and it is not required to create a release configuration. If
set, the minimum frequency is 1 hour. You can
manually trigger compilation on the Release configuration details page ,
or trigger compilation with the
Dataform API releaseConfigs method .
During compilation, Dataform pulls code from the specified
Git commitish of your repository. Then, Dataform compiles the
code with the applied compilation overrides (if there are any), and creates the
compilation result. The latest compilation result created for the release
configuration is the live compilation result.
You can schedule executions of compilation results from release configurations
in
workflow configurations .
You can also
run a selected release configuration
outside of any schedule. During a workflow configuration execution,
Dataform runs the live compilation result from the selected release configuration.
Create a release configuration
To create a Dataform release configuration, follow these steps:
In your repository, go to Releases & Scheduling .
In the Release configurations section, click Create .
In the Create release configuration pane, configure release settings.
In the Release ID field, enter a unique ID for the release
configuration.
IDs can only include numbers, letters, hyphens, and underscores.
In the Git commitish field, enter the Git branch or Git commit
SHA for the release.
In a Dataform repository not connected to a remote
repository, the value is always main .
Optional: In the Frequency field, select the frequency of
creating compilation results.
If set, the minimum frequency is 1 hour.
To disable automatic releases, leave the Frequency field empty.
Note: When act-as mode
is enabled on a Dataform repository that isn't
connected to a third-party Git repository, the Frequency field is
hidden.
Optional: In the Compilation overrides section, configure compilation
settings.
In the Google Cloud Project ID field, enter the ID of the
Google Cloud project in which you want to store the compilation result.
In the Schema suffix field, enter a suffix to append to the
schema configured in
workflow settings .
In the Table prefix field, enter a prefix for all table names.
Optional: In the Compilation variables section, set the compilation
variables.
Click Add variable .
In the Key field, enter the compilation variable.
In the Value field, enter the value for the compilation variable.
To add another compilation variable, click Add variable .
Click Create .
If you override the default project, make sure
your Dataform service agent or custom service account has access
to the project set in the release configuration.
For example, the following release configuration creates a production
compilation result from the main branch every hour,
without any compilation overrides:
Release ID : production
Git commitish : main
Frequency : hourly
No compilation overrides
View details of a release configuration
You can view the following details of a release configuration:
Release settings
Git commitish
Latest compilation result timestamp
Cron schedule
Compilation overrides
Compilation variables
Live compilation result
Creation timestamp
Git commitish
Commit SHA
Past compilation results
To view details of a release configuration, follow these steps:
In your repository, go to Releases & Scheduling .
Select a release configuration.
On the Release configuration details page, inspect the details
of the release configuration.
The Scheduled compilation results table displays past compilation results
created automatically by the release configuration.
The Manual/API compilation results table displays compilation results
created manually or through calls to the Dataform API out of the latest
1,000 compilation results in the repository.
Manually trigger compilation
To manually create a compilation result from a selected release configuration,
follow these steps:
In your repository, go to Releases & Scheduling .
Select a release configuration.
On the Release configuration details page, click New compilation .
If you're using the UI, a newly compiled result automatically goes live for your release configuration. If you're using the API, you must create a new compilation result from the release configuration and then update the release configuration to set the releaseCompilationResult field with this new value.
Manual compilation results are displayed in the
Manual/API compilation results table on the
Release configuration details page.
Trigger execution of a release configuration
To trigger execution of the live compilation result in a selected
release configuration to BigQuery, follow these steps:
In your repository, go to Releases & Scheduling .
In the Release configurations section, click Start execution .
In the Execute manual workflow pane, in the Release configuration
list, select a release configuration.
Select the workflow actions to be run:
To run the entire workflow, click All actions .
To run selected actions in the workflow,
click Selection of actions , and then select actions.
To run actions with selected tags, click
Selection of tags , and then select tags.
Optional: To run selected actions or tags and their dependencies,
select the Include dependencies option.
Optional: To run selected actions or tags and their dependents,
select the Include dependents option.
Optional: To rebuild all tables from scratch, select the
Run with full refresh option.
Without this option, Dataform updates incremental tables
without rebuilding them from scratch.
Click Start execution .
