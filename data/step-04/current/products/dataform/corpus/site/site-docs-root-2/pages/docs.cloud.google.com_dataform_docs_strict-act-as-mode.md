Use strict act-as mode
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The strict act-as mode enables an additional security check for the following
user actions in Dataform:
Creating or updating a repository.
Creating or updating a workflow configuration.
Creating a workflow invocation.
Updating a release configuration.
This additional security check requires that the user performing these actions
has the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on the effective service account,
which is the service account whose credentials are used to run workflows.
For more information, see
Attach service accounts to resources .
You can enable the act-as mode by doing the following:
When creating a repository .
When updating an existing repository with the strict_act_as_checks
repository flag.
Important: For existing repositories, we recommend enabling strict act-as mode,
as this helps to ensure a more secure and predictable permissions model for
your Dataform projects.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to complete the tasks in this document,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser )
on the custom service account
View logs in Logging:
Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer )
on the project
Grant IAM roles to users or service accounts:
Service Account Admin ( roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin )
on the project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Verify act-as permissions for the effective service account
To ensure your Dataform workflows run securely and without
interruption, it's important to verify the act-as permissions on the service
accounts they use. This section explains how to identify the effective service
account for your resources, use Cloud Logging to check for permission issues,
and then resolve any issues you find.
Determine the effective service account
You can determine the effective service account that is running the workflows
according to the resource type and the following conditions:
Resource type
Effective service account
Repositories
For new repositories, the custom service account you select when you create a repository is used. This service account is listed in the Repository.ServiceAccount field.
For existing repositories, this can be a custom service account (recommended) or the Dataform service agent .
Workflow configuration
For new workflow configurations, the custom service account you select when you create a workflow configuration is used. If no service account is selected, the repository's service account is used.
For existing workflow configurations, this can be a custom service account (recommended) or the repository's Dataform service agent .
Workflow invocation
If the compilation result is a WORKFLOW_CONFIG resource, then the workflow configuration's effective service account is used.
If you create a workflow invocation from a compilation result, then the service account listed in the WorkflowInvocation.InvocationConfig field is used if it's set.
Otherwise, this defaults to the service account configured at the repository level.
Important: You can't use the default Dataform service agent to
run workflows. You must use either a custom service account or your Google
Account user credentials.
Check for permission issues in Cloud Logging
To enhance security, Dataform checks if the
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission is missing on the service accounts used
by Dataform resources.
The results of these checks, including any potential permission issues, are
recorded in Cloud Logging. You should review these logs regularly to
identify and grant any missing iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permissions. Checking
these logs ensures that your Dataform workflows and
configurations continue to function without interruption.
View logs in Cloud Logging
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Logs Explorer page.
Go to Logs Explorer
Select the Google Cloud project in which you want to check the logs.
Use the query editor to filter for the Dataform actAs
logs with the following options:
To list only the actAs checks that failed and require action, use the
following query:
logName : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/dataform.googleapis.com%2Factas_dry_run_result"
jsonPayload . dryRunResult = false
To list all of the actAs checks, use the following query:
logName : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /logs/dataform.googleapis.com%2Factas_dry_run_result"
Replace PROJECT_ID with your
Google Cloud project ID.
Click Run query .
Interpret log entries
Expand a log entry in the query results to view the following jsonPayload
fields:
Field
Type
Description
dryRunResult
Boolean
true : the permission check passed. false : the check failed. The caller principal is missing the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on the service account.
caller
String
The email address of the principal (user or service account) that initiated the API call.
serviceAccount
String
The service account that the caller principal attempted to act as. This field is typically present when the dryRunResult field is false .
apiMethod
String
The Dataform API method that triggered the check, for example, CreateWorkflowInvocation or UpdateRepository .
*_context
Object
An object containing resource names relevant to the API method called. For more information, see Context objects .
Important: An exception occurs when dryRunResult is false , serviceAccount
is empty, and apiMethod is CreateWorkflowConfig , UpdateWorkflowConfig , or
CreateWorkflowInvocation . This exception means that the check has failed,
because no service account was specified in the API call where it's required.
You must update your process to provide a service account for these operations.
Context objects
The log entry includes a context object within the jsonPayload fields. The
fields in this object contain the fully qualified Google Cloud resource
names of the Dataform entities involved. These names follow the
standard structures shown in the following list, allowing you to precisely
identify the resources.
create_workflow_invocation_context : present when the API method is
CreateWorkflowInvocation .
workflowInvocation : the resource name of the workflow invocation.
The format of the resource name is the following:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /repositories/ REPOSITORY_ID /workflowInvocations/ WORKFLOW_INVOCATION_ID .
compilationResult or workflowConfig : the resource name of the source
used for the invocation.
The format of the resource name for compilationResult is the following:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /repositories/ REPOSITORY_ID /compilationResults/ COMPILATION_RESULT_ID .
The format of the resource name for workflowConfig is the following:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /repositories/ REPOSITORY_ID /workflowConfigs/ WORKFLOW_CONFIG_ID .
create_repository_context or update_repository_context : present when the
API method is CreateRepository or UpdateRepository .
repository : the resource name of the Dataform repository.
The format of the resource name is the following:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /repositories/ REPOSITORY_ID
update_release_config_context : present when the API method is
UpdateReleaseConfig .
releaseConfig : the resource name of the release configuration.
The format of the resource name is the following:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /repositories/ REPOSITORY_ID /releaseConfigs/ RELEASE_CONFIG_ID .
create_workflow_config_context or update_workflow_config_context : present
when the API method is CreateWorkflowConfig or UpdateWorkflowConfig .
workflowConfig : the resource name of the workflow configuration.
The format of the resource name is the following:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION_ID /repositories/ REPOSITORY_ID /workflowConfigs/ WORKFLOW_CONFIG_ID .
To compare the documented formats to the logging entry, replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the unique identifier of your
Google Cloud project.
LOCATION_ID : the region where your
Dataform repository is located.
REPOSITORY_ID : the user-defined ID of the
Dataform repository. This is the name given to the repository
when it was created.
COMPILATION_RESULT_ID : the system-generated unique
identifier for a Dataform compilation result.
RELEASE_CONFIG_ID : the user-defined ID of the
Dataform release configuration.
WORKFLOW_CONFIG_ID : the user-defined ID of the
Dataform workflow configuration.
Resolve permission issues
If you find log entries where the dryRunResult field is false , do the
following:
In the jsonPayload details, note the email address in the caller field
to identify the principal.
Note the email address in the serviceAccount field to identify the
service account.
Confirm that the caller principal should have permission to act as the
service account. Granting this permission lets the caller use the permissions
held by the service account.
If the access is intended, grant the
Service Account User role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) to the caller principal on the target service
account. For more information, see
Grant the required IAM roles .
After granting the role, future logs for this combination of caller and
service account should show dryRunResult: true .
Grant the required IAM roles
The Service Account User role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) contains the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
permission, which is required for the strict act-as mode. When you use the
Dataform API, you must have the Service Account User role granted
for the effective service account based on the
projects.locations.repositories method
that you're calling:
create
or
patch
If the Repository.ServiceAccount property is set, then you should have
the Service Account User role granted for that property.
If you're calling the patch method, then you should have
the Service Account User role granted for all the effective service
accounts in all the workflow configurations in the repository.
workflowConfigs.create
or
workflowConfigs.patch
You should have the Service Account User role granted for the effective
service account used in the workflow configuration.
releaseConfigs.patch
You should have the Service Account User role granted for all the
effective service accounts used in the workflow configurations using this
release configuration.
workflowInvocations.create
You should have the Service Account User role granted for the effective
service account used in the workflow invocation.
To grant the Service Account User role to a custom service account, follow
these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to IAM >
Service accounts .
Go to Service accounts
Select a project.
On the
Service accounts for project " PROJECT_NAME "
page, select your custom service account.
Go to Principals with access , and then click Grant Access .
In the New principals field, enter your default Dataform
service agent ID.
Your default Dataform service agent ID is in the following
format:
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-dataform.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with your
Google Cloud project number.
In the Select a role list, select the Service Account User role.
Click Add another role and select the Service Account Token Creator role.
Note: This role is required for Dataform to generate
the credentials necessary to run workflows as the custom service
account. For more information, see
Required roles for Dataform service agents, custom service accounts, and Google Accounts .
Click Save .
For more information, see the
required roles for creating a workflow configuration
and
required roles for creating a release configuration
Effects of strict act-as mode on automatic releases and runs
When strict act-as mode is enabled, it impacts automatic repository releases
and automatic workflow executions as follows:
For repositories that aren't connected to third-party repositories:
You can't set a
Cron schedule
for automatic releases in release configurations. This is enforced to prevent
code changes made by a user who might lack the necessary
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permissions on downstream service accounts from being automatically deployed.
Scheduled workflow runs using a Cron schedule in workflow configurations remain enabled. For these automated runs to succeed, you must grant the default
Dataform service agent the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
permission on the
effective service account
specified in the workflow configuration.
For repositories that are connected to third-party repositories:
Scheduled releases and scheduled workflow runs are permitted.
To enable an automatic release from a release configuration or an automatic
run from a workflow configuration, you must grant the default Dataform service agent the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission
on the relevant
effective service account :
For an automatic release configuration, grant the permission on the
effective service accounts of all the workflow configurations that are
triggered by this release configuration.
For an automatic workflow configuration, grant the permission on the
effective service account used by that workflow configuration.
Warning: Because there is no guarantee that the user writing the code has the
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on the effective service accounts for
a third-party repository ,
it's your responsibility to control the code changes in third-party
repositories with the code review process.
