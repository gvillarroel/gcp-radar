Dataform overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document introduces you to Dataform concepts and processes.
Dataform is a service for data analysts to develop, test,
control versions, and schedule complex workflows for
data transformation in BigQuery.
Dataform lets you manage data transformation in the Extraction,
Loading, and Transformation (ELT) process for data integration. After raw data
is extracted from source systems and loaded into BigQuery,
Dataform helps you to transform it into a well-defined, tested,
and documented suite of data tables.
Dataform lets you perform the following data transformation actions:
Develop and run workflows for data transformation.
Collaborate with team members on workflow development through Git.
Manage a large number of tables and their dependencies.
Declare source data and manage table dependencies.
View a visualization of the dependency tree of your workflow.
Manage data with SQL code in a central repository.
Reuse code with JavaScript.
Test data correctness with quality tests on source and output tables.
Version control SQL code.
Document data tables inside SQL code.
Data transformation processes in Dataform
The data transformation workflow for Dataform is as follows:
Dataform lets you create repositories to manage your code.
Dataform lets you create workspaces for development.
Dataform lets you develop workflows in a development workspace.
Dataform compiles Dataform core into SQL.
Dataform runs the dependency tree.
Dataform lets you create repositories to manage your code
In a Dataform repository , you use
Dataform core , an extension of SQL,
to write SQLX files in which you define your workflow. Dataform
repositories support version control. You can link a Dataform
repository to a third-party Git provider .
Dataform lets you create workspaces for development
You can create development workspaces inside
a Dataform repository for Dataform core development. In a
development workspace, you can make changes to the repository, compile, test,
and push them to the main repository through Git.
Dataform lets you develop Dataform core in a development workspace
In a development workspace, you can define and document tables,
their dependencies, and transformation logic to build your workflow.
You can also configure actions in JavaScript .
Dataform compiles Dataform core
During compilation , Dataform performs the
following tasks:
Compiles Dataform core into a workflow of Standard SQL.
Adds boilerplate SQL statements, such as CREATE TABLE or INSERT ,
to the code inline with your query configuration.
Transpiles (compiles source-to-source) JavaScript into SQL.
Resolves dependencies and checks for errors including missing
or circular dependencies.
Builds the dependency tree of all actions to be run in BigQuery.
Dataform compilation is hermetic to verify compilation consistency,
meaning that the same code compiles to the same SQL compilation result every time.
Dataform compiles your code in a sandbox
environment with no internet access. No additional actions, such as calling
external APIs, are available during compilation.
To debug in real-time, you can inspect the compiled workflow of
your project in an interactive graph in your development workspace.
Dataform runs the dependency tree
In BigQuery, Dataform performs the following tasks:
Runs SQL commands, following the order of the dependency tree.
Runs assertion queries against your tables and views to
check data correctness.
Runs other SQL operations that you defined.
After the execution, you can use your tables and views for all your analytics
purposes.
You can view logs to see what tables were
created, if assertions passed or failed, how long each action took to complete,
and other information. You can also view the exact SQL code
that was run in BigQuery.
Dataform features
With Dataform, you can develop and deploy tables, incremental tables, or views to BigQuery. Dataform offers a web environment for the following activities:
Workflow development
Connection with GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps Services, and Bitbucket
Continuous integration and continuous deployment
Workflow execution
The following sections describe the main features of Dataform.
Repositories
Each Dataform project is stored in a
repository .
A Dataform repository houses a collection of JSON configuration
files, SQLX files, and JavaScript files.
Note: The Dataform repositories list includes only
repositories created for Dataform workflow development.
Repositories for BigQuery Studio assets, such as notebooks or saved
queries, are managed separately and don't appear in this list.
Dataform repositories contain the following types of files:
Config files
Config JSON or SQLX files let you configure your workflows.
They contain general configuration, execution schedules, or schema for
creating new tables and views.
Definitions
Definitions are SQLX and JavaScript files that define new tables, views,
and additional SQL operations
to run in BigQuery.
Includes
Includes
are JavaScript files where you can define variables and functions to use in
your project.
Each Dataform repository is connected to the default
Dataform service agent or a custom service account. You can
connect new repositories to only custom service accounts. You select the
custom service account when you
create a repository
or
edit the service account
later.
By default, Dataform uses a service agent or service account
derived from your project number in the following format:
service- YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-dataform.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Version control
Dataform uses the Git version control system to maintain a record of
each change made to project files and to manage file versions.
Each Dataform repository can manage its own Git repository, or be
connected to a remote third-party Git repository. You can
connect a Dataform repository to a GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps Services, or Bitbucket repository .
Users
version control their workflow code
inside Dataform workspaces. In a Dataform workspace,
you can pull changes from the repository, commit all or selected changes,
and push them to Git branches of the repository.
Workflow development
In Dataform, you make changes to files and directories inside a
development workspace .
A development workspace is a virtual, editable copy of
the contents of a Git repository. Dataform preserves the state of
files in your development workspace between sessions.
In a development workspace, you can
develop workflow actions
by using Dataform core with
SQLX and JavaScript, or
exclusively with JavaScript .
You can automatically format your Dataform core or JavaScript code.
Each element of a Dataform workflow, such as a table or assertion,
corresponds to an action that Dataform performs in BigQuery.
For example, a table definition file is an action of creating or updating the
table in BigQuery.
In a Dataform workspace, you can develop the following
workflow actions:
Source data declarations
Tables and views
Incremental tables
Table partitions and clusters
Dependencies between actions
Documentation of tables
Custom SQL operations
BigQuery labels
BigQuery policy tags
Dataform tags
Data quality tests, called assertions
You can use JavaScript to reuse your Dataform workflow code
in the following ways:
Across a file with code encapsulation
Across a repository with includes
Across repositories with packages
Dataform compiles the workflow code in your workspace in real-time.
In your workspace, you can view the compiled queries and details of actions
in each file. You can also view the compilation status and errors in
the edited file or in the repository.
To test the output of a compiled SQL query before you run it to
BigQuery, you can
run preview of the query
in your Dataform workspace.
To inspect the entire workflow defined in your workspace, you can
view an interactive compiled graph
that shows all compiled actions in your workflow and relationships between them.
Workflow compilation
Dataform uses default compilation settings,
configured in the workflow settings file ,
to compile the workflow code in your workspace to SQL in real-time,
creating a compilation result of the workspace.
You can override compilation settings to customize how Dataform
compiles your workflow into a compilation result.
With workspace compilation overrides ,
you can configure compilation overrides for all workspaces in a repository.
You can set dynamic workspace overrides to create compilation results custom
for each workspace, turning workspaces into isolated development environments.
You can override the Google Cloud project in which Dataform
runs the contents of a workspace, add a prefix to names of all compiled tables,
and add a suffix to the default schema.
With
release configurations ,
you can configure templates of compilation settings for creating compilation
results of a Dataform repository. In a release configuration, you
can override the Google Cloud project in which Dataform
runs the compilation results, add a prefix to names of all compiled tables, add a
suffix the default schema, and add compilation variables. You can also set
the frequency of creating compilation results. To schedule runs of compilation
results created in a selected release configuration, you can
create a workflow configuration .
Workflow run
During a workflow run, Dataform runs the compilation results
of workflows to create or update assets in BigQuery.
To create or refresh the tables and views defined in your workflow in
BigQuery, you can
start a workflow run manually
in a development workspace or schedule runs.
You can schedule Dataform runs in BigQuery in the
following ways:
Create workflow configurations to
schedule runs of compilation results created in release configurations
Schedule runs with Cloud Composer
Schedule runs with Workflows and Cloud Scheduler
You can also
automate runs with Cloud Build triggers .
To debug errors, you can monitor runs in the following ways:
View detailed Dataform execution logs
View audit logs for Dataform
View Cloud Logging logs for Dataform
Dataform core
Dataform core is an open source meta-language to create SQL tables and
workflows. Dataform core extends SQL by providing a dependency
management system, automated data quality testing, and data documentation.
You can use Dataform core for the following purposes:
Defining tables, views, materialized views, or incremental tables.
Defining data transformation logic.
Declaring source data and managing table dependencies.
Documenting table and column descriptions inside code.
Reusing functions and variables across different queries.
Writing data assertions to verify data consistency.
In Dataform, you use Dataform core to develop workflows
and deploy assets to BigQuery.
Dataform core is part of the
open-source Dataform data modeling framework
that also includes Dataform CLI .
You can compile and run Dataform core locally through the Dataform
CLI outside of Google Cloud.
To use Dataform core, you write SQLX files. Each SQLX file contains a
query that defines a database relation that Dataform creates and
updates inside BigQuery.
Dataform compiles your Dataform core code in real time to
create a SQL compilation result that you can run in BigQuery.
Dataform compilation is hermetic to verify compilation consistency,
meaning that the same code compiles to the same SQL compilation result every time.
Dataform compiles your code in a sandbox environment with no internet
access. No additional actions, such as calling external APIs, are available
during compilation.
SQLX file config block
A SQLX file consists of a config block and a body. All config properties, and
the config block itself, are optional. Given this, any plain SQL file is a
valid SQLX file that Dataform runs as-is.
In the config block, you can perform the following actions:
Specify query metadata.
Document data.
Define data quality tests.
Specify query metadata
You can configure how Dataform materializes queries into BigQuery,
for example the output table type, the target database, or labels
using the config metadata.
Document data
You can document your tables
and their fields directly in the config block. Documentation of your tables is
pushed directly to BigQuery. You can parse this documentation and push
it out to other tools.
Define data quality tests
You can define data quality tests, called assertions ,
to check for uniqueness, null values, or a custom condition. Dataform
adds assertions defined in the config block to your workflow dependency tree
after table creation. You can also define assertions outside the config block,
in a separate SQLX file.
The following code sample shows you how to define the output table type,
document the table, and define a quality test in a config block of a SQLX file.
config {
type : "table" ,
description : "This table joins orders information from OnlineStore & payment information from PaymentApp" ,
columns : {
order_date : "The date when a customer placed their order" ,
id : "Order ID as defined by OnlineStore" ,
order_status : "The status of an order e.g. sent, delivered" ,
customer_id : "Unique customer ID" ,
payment_status : "The status of a payment e.g. pending, paid" ,
payment_method : "How the customer chose to pay" ,
item_count : "The number of items the customer ordered" ,
amount : "The amount the customer paid"
} ,
assertions : {
uniqueKey : [ "id" ]
}
}
SQLX file body
In the body of a SQLX file, you can perform the following actions:
Define a table and its dependencies.
Define additional SQL operations to run in BigQuery.
Generate SQL code with JavaScript.
Define a table
To define a new table you can use SQL SELECT statements and the ref function.
The ref function is a SQLX built-in function that is critical to dependency
management in Dataform. The ref function lets you reference tables
defined in your Dataform project instead of hard coding the schema and
table names of your data table.
Dataform uses the ref function to build a dependency tree of all the
tables to be created or updated. After compiling, Dataform adds
boilerplate statements like CREATE , REPLACE , or INSERT .
The following code sample shows you how to reference a table in a SQLX file
with the ref function.
config { type : "table" }
SELECT
order_date AS date ,
order_id AS order_id ,
order_status AS order_status ,
SUM ( item_count ) AS item_count ,
SUM ( amount ) AS revenue
FROM ${ ref ( "store_clean" ) }
GROUP BY 1 , 2 , 3
The output is similar to the following:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE Dataform . orders AS
SELECT
order_date AS date ,
order_id AS order_id ,
order_status AS order_status ,
SUM ( item_count ) AS item_count ,
SUM ( amount ) AS revenue
FROM Dataform_stg . store_clean
GROUP BY 1 , 2 , 3
For more information on additional dependency management, for example,
executing code conditionally, using other Dataform core built-in
functions, see the Dataform core reference .
Define additional SQL operations
To configure Dataform to run one or more SQL statements before or
after creating a table or view, you can
specify pre-query and post-query operations .
The following code sample shows you how to configure table or view access
permissions in a post-query operation.
SELECT * FROM ...
post_operations {
GRANT ` roles / bigquery . dataViewer ` ON TABLE ${ self () } TO "group:someusers@dataform.co"
}
Encapsulate SQL code
To define reusable functions to generate repetitive parts of SQL code, you can
use JavaScript blocks. You can reuse code defined in a JavaScript block only
inside the SQLX file where the block is defined. To reuse code across your
entire repository, you can
create includes .
To dynamically modify a query, you can use inline JavaScript anywhere in the body.
The following code sample shows how to define a JavaScript block in a SQLX file
and use it inline inside a query:
js {
const columnName = "foo" ;
}
SELECT 1 AS ${ columnName } FROM "..."
Limitations
Dataform has the following known limitations:
Dataform in Google Cloud runs on a plain V8 runtime and does not
support additional capabilities and modules provided by Node.js. If your
existing codebase requires any Node.js modules ,
you need to remove these dependencies.
Projects without a name field in package.json generate diffs on
package-lock.json every time packages are installed. To avoid this outcome,
you need to add a name property in package.json .
git + https:// URLs for dependencies in package.json are not
supported.
Convert such URLs to plain https:// archive URLs.
For example, convert git+https://github.com/dataform-co/dataform-segment.git#1.5
to https://github.com/dataform-co/dataform-segment/archive/1.5.tar.gz .
Manually running unit tests is not available.
Searching for file content in development workspaces is not available.
Note: For the list of egress IP address ranges to use when allow-listing
Dataform IPs with third-party remote repositories, see
Dataform locations .
As of Dataform core 3.0.0. ,
Dataform doesn't distribute a Docker image. You can build your own
Docker image of Dataform, which you can use to run the equivalent of
Dataform CLI commands. To build your own Docker image, see
Containerize an application
in the Docker documentation.
The following Dataform API methods don't comply with the
AIP.134 guidelines
by treating the * wildcard entry as a bad request and by
updating all fields instead of set fields when field_mask is omitted:
releaseConfigs - patch
repositories - patch
updateConfig
workflowConfigs - patch
If a scheduled workflow configuration run doesn't finish before the start of
the next scheduled run, the next scheduled run is skipped and marked with an
error.
