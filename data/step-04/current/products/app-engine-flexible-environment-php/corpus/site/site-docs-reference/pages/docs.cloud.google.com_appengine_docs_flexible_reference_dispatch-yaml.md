Region ID
The REGION_ID is an abbreviated code that Google assigns
based on the region you select when you create your app. The code does not
correspond to a country or province, even though some region IDs may appear
similar to commonly used country and province codes. For apps created after
February 2020, REGION_ID .r is included in
App Engine URLs. For existing apps created before this date, the
region ID is optional in the URL.

OK
The dispatch.yaml allows you to override routing
rules .
You can use the dispatch.yaml to send incoming requests to a specific service
(formerly known as modules) based on the path or hostname in the URL.
For more information, see How Requests are Routed .
An app can have only one dispatch.yaml file, and the routing rules in that file
apply to all of the app's services and versions.
Deploying the dispatch file
To deploy and apply the configuration settings from your dispatch file to your
App Engine environment:
gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml
Syntax
The root element in the dispatch.yaml file is dispatch: and contains a list
of routing definitions that are specified by the following subelements.
The rules that you define in your dispatch file must use HTTP URL patterns
that include the " . " notation for separating subdomains. URLs
defined with the HTTPS " -dot- " notation are not supported.
Dispatch rules are order dependent, and only the first rule that matches a URL
will be applied.
Element
Description
service
Specifies the name of the service that will handle the requests that
match the url pattern. Note that
services were previously called modules.
url
In the url element, you define the URL
pattern within quotes,
which can include the host name and URL path that are no longer than 100 characters.
For the service element, you specify the
name of the service that you want handling any incoming requests that
match the URL pattern of the url element.
Tip: You can include glob patterns like the * wildcard
character in the url element; however, those patterns
can be used only before the host name and at the end of the URL path.
URL paths that begin with /_ah/ are not routed by the
dispatch file.
Example
The following is a sample dispatch file that routes requests to
https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com and requests like
https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/favicon.ico to the default service. All
static content is served from the default service. Mobile requests like
https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile/ are routed to a mobile frontend, and
worker requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/work/ are routed to a
static backend.
Example:
dispatch :
# Default service serves the typical web resources and all static resources.
- url : "*/favicon.ico"
service : default
# Default service serves simple hostname request.
- url : "simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/"
service : default
# Send all mobile traffic to the mobile frontend.
- url : "*/mobile/*"
service : mobile-frontend
# Send all work to the one static backend.
- url : "*/work/*"
service : static-backend
If you prefer general routing rules that match many possible requests, you can
define rules with wider scopes.
Example:
# Send any path that begins with “simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile” to the mobile-frontend service.
- url : "simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile*"
service : mobile-frontend
# Send any domain/sub-domain with a path that starts with “work” to the static backend service.
- url : "*/work*"
service : static-backend
You can also write expressions that are more strict.
Example:
# Matches the path "/fun", but not "/fun2" or "/fun/other"
- url : "*/fun"
service : mobile-frontend
# Matches the hostname 'customer1.myapp.com', but not '1.customer1.myapp.com.
- url : "customer1.myapp.com/*"
service : static-backend
You can create rules to re-direct your incoming domain requests to a service.
The following rules route incoming requests from "customer1.myapp.com" to the
default service and incoming requests from subdomains to a static backend
service.
Example:
# Matches the domain name 'customer1.myapp.com' and directs all the request to default service
- url : "customer1.myapp.com/*"
service : default
# Matches all the subdomains of 'customer1.myapp.com' and directs all the request to static-backend service
- url : "*.customer1.myapp.com/*"
service : static-backend
Limits
The dispatch file can contain up to 20 routing rules. When specifying the URL
string, neither the hostname nor the path can be longer than 100 characters.
Deleting all dispatch rules
To delete all dispatch rules:
Edit the contents of the dispatch.yaml file to:
dispatch : []
Deploy the dispatch.yaml file to App Engine.
