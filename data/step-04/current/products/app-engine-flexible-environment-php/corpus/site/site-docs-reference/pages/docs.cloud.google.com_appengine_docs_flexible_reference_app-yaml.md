app.yaml Configuration File
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Go
Java
Node.js
PHP
Python
Ruby
.NET
Custom
Note: Some Python runtimes have reached end of support . You cannot re-deploy
versions that use runtimes after their end of support date. We recommend that
you upgrade your app
to use the latest version of Python.
The app.yaml file defines your configuration settings for your runtime as well
as general app, network, and other resource settings.
Do not add app.yaml to the .gcloudignore
file. app.yaml might be required for deployment, and adding it to
.gcloudignore will cause the deployment to fail.
Syntax
The syntax of the app.yaml file is the YAML format .
The YAML format supports comments, where any line that begins with the hash
symbol ( # ) character is ignored, for example:
# This is a comment.
URL and file path patterns use POSIX extended regular expression
syntax , excluding collating
elements and collation classes. Back-references to grouped matches (e.g. \1 )
are supported, as are these Perl extensions: \w \W \s \S \d \D .
General settings
An app.yaml file can include these general settings. Note that some of them
are required:
Name Description
build_env_variables
Optional. If you are using a runtime that supports
buildpacks , you
can define build environment variables in your
app.yaml file.
To learn more, see
Using build environment variables .
runtime
Required. The name of the runtime environment that is used by your app.
For example, to specify the runtime environment, use:
runtime : python
Specifying python selects a full implementation of the
Python 2.7 or 3.7 runtime.
To specify a supported version of Python or to use the new Python
runtimes, see the
runtime_config setting .
These runtimes do not support any App Engine APIs.
You must use the APIs available for the service you want to use, like
Google Cloud APIs .
For more information and an example, see
Python runtime
and Configuring your app with app.yaml .
runtime_config
Specifies the Python runtime version. Starting in Python version 3.8,
you must specify the version of the operating system.
runtime_config :
operating_system : "ubuntu24"
runtime_version : "3.14"
operating_system : Specifies the version of the Ubuntu
operating system that you want to use.
Required for Python version 3.8 and later. Not supported for Python version
3.7 and earlier. See the supported Ubuntu versions and runtimes on
the Python runtimes
page.
runtime_version : Optional for all runtime versions.
Specifies the version of the Python runtime that you want to use.
See the supported versions and the default values on the
Python runtimes
page.
env: flex
Required: Select the flexible environment.
entrypoint
The command to start your application. The entrypoint starts a process that
responds to HTTP requests on the port defined by the environment variable
PORT .
service: service_name
Required if creating a service. Optional for the default service. Each
service and each version must have a name. A name can contain numbers,
letters, and hyphens. In the flexible environment, the combined length of
VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT_ID
(where VERSION is the name of your version,
SERVICE is the name of your service, and
PROJECT_ID is your project ID) cannot be longer
than 63 characters and cannot start or end with a hyphen.
If you deploy without specifying a service name, then a new version of the
default service is created. If you deploy with
a service name that already exists, a new version of that service is
created. If you deploy with a new service name that doesn't exist, a new
service and version are created. We recommend using a unique name
for each service-version combination.
Note: Services were previously called "modules."
service_account
Optional. The service_account element lets you specify a
user-managed service account
as the identity for the version. The specified service account will
be used when accessing other Google Cloud services and
executing tasks.
The service account must be provided in the following format:
service_account : [ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME ] @ [ PROJECT_ID ] . iam.gserviceaccount.com
skip_files
Optional.
The skip_files element specifies which files in the
application directory are not to be uploaded to App Engine. The value
is either a regular expression, or a list of regular expressions. Any
filename that matches any of the regular expressions is omitted from
the list of files to upload when the application is uploaded.
For example, to skip files whose names end in .bak , add
a skip_files section like the following:
skip_files :
- ^.*\.bak$
Runtime-specific settings
See the Python
runtime page to learn more about specifying a Python interpreter using the
runtime_config settings.
Network settings
You can specify network settings in your app.yaml configuration file, for
example:
network :
name : NETWORK_NAME
instance_ip_mode : INSTANCE_IP_MODE
instance_tag : TAG_NAME
subnetwork_name : SUBNETWORK_NAME
session_affinity : true
forwarded_ports :
- PORT
- HOST_PORT : CONTAINER_PORT
- PORT /tcp
- HOST_PORT : CONTAINER_PORT /udp
You can use the following options when configuring network settings:
Option
Description
name
Every VM instance in the flexible environment is assigned to a Google Compute Engine network when it is created. Use this setting to specify a network name. Give the short name, not the resource path (for example, default rather than https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/global/networks/default ). If you do not specify a network name, instances are assigned to the project's default network (which has the name default ). If you want to specify a subnetwork name, you must specify a network name.
instance_ip_mode
Optional. To prevent instances from receiving an ephemeral external IP address, set to internal and enable Private Google Access . If your instance was previously deployed without this setting, or was deployed with this set to external , redeploying with it set to internal removes ephemeral external IP addresses from your instances. The internal setting has limitations . Default is external .
instance_tag
Optional. A tag with that name is assigned to each instance of the service when it is created. Tags can be useful in gcloud commands to target an action to a group of instances. For example, see the use of the --source-tags and --target-tags flags in the compute firewalls-create command. If not specified, the instance is tagged with aef- INSTANCE_ID when Shared VPC is not used. If Shared VPC is used, the instance is tagged with both aef- INSTANCE_ID and aef-instance .
subnetwork_name
Optional. You can segment your network and use a custom subnetwork. Ensure that the network name is specified. Give the short name, not the resource path (for example, default rather than https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/global/networks/default/subnetworks/default ).The subnetwork must be in the same region as the application.
session_affinity
Optional. Set to true to configure App Engine to route multiple sequential requests for a given user to the same App Engine instance such as when storing user data locally during a session. Session affinity enables inspecting the value of a cookie to identify multiple requests by the same user and then directs all such requests to the same instance. If the instance is rebooted, unhealthy, overloaded or becomes unavailable when the number of instances has been scaled down, session affinity will be broken and further requests are then routed to a different instance. Note that enabling session affinity can affect your load balancing setup. This parameter is disabled by default.
forwarded_ports
Optional. You can forward ports from your instance ( HOST_PORT ) to the Docker container ( CONTAINER_PORT ). HOST_PORT must be between 1024 and 65535 and cannot conflict with the following ports: 22, 8080, 8090, 8443, 10000, 10001, 10400-10500, 11211, 24231. CONTAINER_PORT must be between 1 and 65535 and cannot conflict with the following ports: 22, 10001, 10400-10500, 11211. If you only specify a PORT , then App Engine assumes that it is the same port on the host and the container. By default, both TCP and UDP traffic are forwarded. Traffic must be directly addressed to the target instance's IP address rather than over the appspot.com domain or your custom domain.
Advanced network configuration
You can segment your Compute Engine network into subnetworks. This allows
you to enable VPN scenarios, such as accessing databases within your corporate
network.
To enable subnetworks for your App Engine application:
Create a custom subnet network .
Add the network name and subnetwork name to your app.yaml file, as specified above .
To establish a simple VPN based on static routing,
create a gateway and a tunnel for a custom subnet network .
Otherwise, see how to create other types of VPNs .
Port forwarding
Port forwarding allows for direct connections to the Docker container on your
instances. This traffic can travel over any protocol. Port forwarding is
intended to help with situations where you might need to attach a debugger or
profiler. Traffic must be directly addressed to the target instance's IP address
rather than over the appspot.com domain or your custom domain.
By default, incoming traffic from outside your network is not allowed through
the Google Cloud Platform
firewalls .
After you have specified port forwarding in your app.yaml file, you must add a
firewall rule that allows traffic from the ports you want opened.
You can specify a firewall rule in the Networking Firewall Rules page in the
Google Cloud console
or using gcloud commands .
For example, if you want to forward TCP traffic from port 2222 :
In the network settings of your app.yaml , include:
network :
forwarded_ports :
- 2222/tcp
If you use the Python runtime, modify the app.yaml to include:
entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT -b :2222 main:app
Specify a firewall rule in the
Google Cloud console
or using gcloud compute firewall-rules create
to allow traffic from any source ( 0.0.0.0/0 ) and from tcp:2222 .
Resource settings
These settings control the computing resources. App Engine assigns a machine type
based on the amount of CPU and memory you've specified. The machine is
guaranteed to have at least the level of resources you've specified, it might
have more.
You can specify up to eight volumes of tmpfs
in the resource settings. You can then enable workloads that require shared memory
via tmpfs and can improve file system I/O.
For example:
resources :
cpu : 2
memory_gb : 2.3
disk_size_gb : 10
volumes :
- name : ramdisk1
volume_type : tmpfs
size_gb : 0.5
You can use the following options when configuring resource settings:
Option
Description
Default
cpu
The number of cores; it must be one, an even number between 2 and 32, or a multiple of 4 between 32 and 80.
1 core
memory_gb
RAM in GB. The requested memory for your application, which does not
include the ~0.4 GB of memory that is required for the overhead of some
processes. Each CPU core requires a total memory between 1.0 and 6.5
GB.
To calculate the requested memory:
memory_gb = cpu * [1.0 - 6.5] - 0.4
For the example above where you have specified 2 cores, you can
request between 1.6 and 12.6 GB. The total amount of memory available to
the application is set by the runtime environment as the environment
variable GAE_MEMORY_MB .
0.6 GB
disk_size_gb
Size in GB. The minimum is 10 GB and the maximum is 10240 GB.
13 GB
name
Required, if using volumes. Name of the volume. Names must be unique and
between 1 and 63 characters. Characters can be lowercase letters,
numbers, or dashes. The first character must be a letter, and the last
character cannot be a dash. The volume is mounted in the app container
as /mnt/NAME .
volume_type
Required, if using volumes. Must be tmpfs .
size_gb
Required, if using volumes. Size of the volume, in GB. The minimum is
0.001 GB and the maximum is the amount of memory available in the
application container and on the underlying device. Google does not add
additional RAM to your system to satisfy the disk requirements. RAM
allocated for tmpfs volumes will be subtracted from memory available to
the app container. The precision is system dependent.
Split health checks
By default, split health checks are enabled. You can use periodic health check
requests to confirm that a VM instance has been successfully deployed, and to
check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. Each health check must
be answered within a specified time interval.
An instance is unhealthy when it fails to respond to a specified number of
consecutive health check requests. If an instance is not live, then it is
restarted. If an instance is not ready, then it will not receive any client
requests. A health check can also fail if there is no free disk space.
There are two types of health checks that you can use:
Liveness checks confirm that the VM and Docker container
are running. App Engine restarts unhealthy instances.
Readiness checks confirm your instance is ready to accept
incoming requests. Instances that fail the readiness check are not added to
the pool of available instances.
Warning: Legacy health checks using the /_ah/health path are now deprecated,
and you should migrate to use split health checks .
By default, HTTP requests from health checks are not forwarded to your
application container. If you want to extend health checks to your application,
then specify a path for liveness checks or
readiness checks . A customized health check to your
application is considered successful if it returns a 200 OK response code.
Liveness checks
Liveness checks confirm that the VM and the Docker container are running.
Instances that are deemed unhealthy are restarted.
You can customize liveness check requests by adding an optional liveness_check
section to your app.yaml file, for example:
liveness_check :
path : "/liveness_check"
check_interval_sec : 30
timeout_sec : 4
failure_threshold : 2
success_threshold : 2
The following settings are available for liveness checks:
Field
Default
Range (Minimum-Maximum)
Description
path
None
If you want liveness checks to be forwarded to your application
container, specify a URL path, such as "/liveness_check"
timeout_sec
4 seconds
1-300
Timeout interval for each request, in seconds.
check_interval_sec
30 seconds
1-300
Time interval between checks, in seconds. Note that this value must
be greater than timeout_sec.
failure_threshold
4 checks
1-10
An instance is unhealthy after failing this number of consecutive
checks.
success_threshold
2 checks
1-10
An unhealthy instance becomes healthy again after successfully
responding to this number of consecutive checks.
initial_delay_sec
300 seconds
0-3600
The delay, in seconds, after the instance starts during which health
check responses are ignored. This setting applies to each newly
created instance and can allow a new instance more time to get up and
running. The setting delays autohealing from checking on and potentially
prematurely recreating the instance if the instance is in the process of
starting up. The initial delay timer starts when the instance is in
RUNNING mode. For example, you may want to increase the delay if your
application has initialization tasks that take a long time before it is
ready to serve traffic.
Readiness checks
Readiness checks confirm that an instance can accept incoming requests.
Instances that don't pass the readiness check are not added to the pool
of available instances.
You can customize health check requests by adding an optional readiness_check
section to your app.yaml file, for example:
readiness_check :
path : "/readiness_check"
check_interval_sec : 5
timeout_sec : 4
failure_threshold : 2
success_threshold : 2
app_start_timeout_sec : 300
The following settings are available for readiness checks:
Field
Default
Range (Minimum-Maximum)
Description
path
None
If you want readiness checks to be forwarded to your application
container, specify a URL path, such as "/readiness_check"
timeout_sec
4 seconds
1-300
Timeout interval for each request, in seconds.
check_interval_sec
5 seconds
1-300
Time interval between checks, in seconds. Note that this value must
be greater than timeout_sec.
failure_threshold
2 checks
1-10
An instance is unhealthy after failing this number of consecutive
checks.
success_threshold
2 checks
1-10
An unhealthy instance becomes healthy after successfully
responding to this number of consecutive checks.
app_start_timeout_sec
300 seconds
1-1800
This setting applies to new deployments, not individual VMs.
It specifies the maximum time in seconds allowed for a sufficient
number of instances in a deployment to pass health checks. If this
duration is exceeded then the deployment fails and is rolled back.
The timer starts when the Compute Engine instances have been
provisioned and the Load Balancer backend service has been created.
For example, you might want to increase the timeout if you wish to
provide longer timeouts during deployments for a sufficient number of
instances to become healthy.
Health check frequency
To ensure high availability, App Engine creates redundant copies of each health
checker. If a health checker fails, a redundant one can take over with no
delay.
If you examine the nginx.health_check logs for your application, you might see
health check polling happening more frequently than you have configured, due to
the redundant health checkers that are also following your settings. These
redundant health checkers are created automatically and you cannot configure
them.
Service scaling settings
The keys used to control scaling of a service depend on the type of
scaling
you assign to the service.
You can use either automatic or manual scaling. The default is automatic scaling.
Automatic scaling
You can configure automatic scaling by adding an automatic_scaling section to your app.yaml file. For example:
automatic_scaling :
min_num_instances : 1
max_num_instances : 15
cool_down_period_sec : 180
cpu_utilization :
target_utilization : 0.6
target_concurrent_requests : 100
The following table lists the settings you can use with automatic scaling:
Name
Description
automatic_scaling
Automatic scaling is assumed by default. Include this line if you are
going to specify any of the automatic scaling settings.
min_num_instances
The minimum number of instances given to your service. When a service
is deployed, it is given this many instances and scales according
to traffic.
Must be 1 or greater, default is 2 to reduce
latency.
Note: The number of running instances may drop
below this value for a short period of time during some events. If
your application requires running continuously on a certain number of
instances, consider
overprovisioning .
max_num_instances
The maximum number of instances that your service
can scale up to. The maximum number of instances in
your project is limited by your project's
resource quota .
Default is 20 .
cool_down_period_sec
The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents the
autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is initializing,
during which the collected usage would not be reliable. The cool-down
period must be greater than or equal to 60 seconds.
Default is 120 .
cpu_utilization
Use this header if you are going to specify the target CPU
utilization.
target_utilization
Target CPU utilization. CPU use is averaged
across all running instances and is used to decide when to reduce or
increase the number of instances. Note that instances are downscaled
irrespective of in-flight requests 25 seconds after an instance receives
the shutdown signal. Default is 0.5 .
target_concurrent_requests
( Beta ) Target number of concurrent connections per instance.
If you specify a value for this parameter, then the autoscaler uses the
average number of concurrent connections across all running instances to
decide when to reduce or increase the number of instances. An instance is
downscaled 25 seconds after it receives the shutdown signal, regardless
of requests that are in process.
If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the autoscaler
doesn't target a number of concurrent connections per instance.
Connections are different from requests. A connection can be reused by
a client to send multiple requests.
Note: flexible environment has a limit of
4,096 worker connections in Nginx per instance.
Manual scaling
You can configure manual scaling by adding a manual_scaling section to your app.yaml file. For example:
manual_scaling :
instances : 5
The following table lists the settings you can use with manual scaling:
Name Description
manual_scaling
Required to enable manual scaling for a service.
instances
The number of instances to assign to the service.
Note: The number of running instances may drop
below this value for a short period of time during some events. If
your application requires running continuously on a certain number of
instances, consider
overprovisioning .
Defining environment variables
You can define environment variables in app.yaml to make them available to
your app, for example:
env_variables :
MY_VAR : "my value"
where MY_VAR and my value are the name and value of the environment variable
that you want to define and each environment variable entry is indented two
spaces under the env_variables element.
Using your environment variables
To retrieve and your environment variable for the Python runtime,
use os.environ .
Also see the list of runtime environment variables
that cannot be overwritten. For example, all the environment
variables that are prefixed with GAE are reserved for system use.
