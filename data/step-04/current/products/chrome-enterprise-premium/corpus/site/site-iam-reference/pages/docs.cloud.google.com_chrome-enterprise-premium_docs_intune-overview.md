Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that focuses on mobile device management (MDM) and
mobile application management (MAM). Microsoft Intune helps administrators assess
the security posture of managed devices within their organization. Google's Chrome Enterprise Premium
integrates with Microsoft Intune to let you ensure that the devices
connecting to your organization's web resources and applications are authorized, secured, and
managed as per your organization's policies.
When to use Chrome Enterprise Premium integration with Intune
Use this integration when you want to collect the
real-time information about the devices in your organization using Intune,
and use this information to manage your devices and control access to
your organizational resources using Chrome Enterprise Premium.
How Chrome Enterprise Premium works with Intune
Chrome Enterprise Premium uses a zero trust model to grant access to your organizational
resources based on a user's device identity and context of the request.
In this integration, Intune collects the real-time device information and provides this information to
Chrome Enterprise Premium. The BCE Intune connector collects data from Intune using Microsoft Graph APIs.
Access Context Manager , which is a part of Chrome Enterprise Premium,
uses the device information collected by the BCE Intune connector, and provides security-based access
control to your resources by using access levels.
Note: Creating custom access levels in Access Context Manager is available in Chrome Enterprise Premium
, which is the paid subscription of Chrome Enterprise Premium. To upgrade, contact our sales team .
