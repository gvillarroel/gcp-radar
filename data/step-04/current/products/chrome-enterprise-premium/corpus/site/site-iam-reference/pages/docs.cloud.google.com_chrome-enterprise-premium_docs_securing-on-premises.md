Securing non-Google Cloud applications using the On-Prem Connector
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to secure an HTTP or HTTPS based, on-premises app outside of
Google Cloud with
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) by deploying an
IAP connector.
Before you begin
Before you begin, you need the following:
An HTTP or HTTPS based on-premises app.
A Cloud Identity member granted the
Owner role
on your Google Cloud project.
Note: IAM basic roles are highly
permissive roles that give broad access to Google Cloud resources. We
recommend that you avoid granting basic roles in a production environment. You
can grant basic roles in a development or test environment.
The Google APIs Service Agent granted with the owner role.
A Google Cloud project with
billing enabled .
The external URL to use as the ingress point for traffic to
Google Cloud. For example, hr.example.com .
An SSL or TLS certificate for the DNS hostname that is used as the ingress
point for traffic to Google Cloud. An existing self-managed or
Google-managed
certificate can be used. If you don't have a certificate, create one using
Let's Encrypt .
If VPC Service Controls is enabled, a VPC network with an
egress policy
on the cp action for the VM service account to the gce-mesh bucket in
project 278958399328 . The policy grants the VPC network permission to retrieve the
Envoy binary file from the gce-mesh bucket.
The permission is granted by default, if VPC Service Controls is not enabled.
Disable an external IP by completing the following steps:
Enable Private Google Access on the VPC subnet that is used for the IAP connector. For more information, see Private Google Access .
Verify that the firewall configuration of the VPC network lets the VMs access IP addresses of Google APIs and services. By default, this access is granted, but users can change it explicitly. For information on how to find the IP range, see IP addresses for default domains .
Deploy a connector for an on-premises app
Go to the IAP page.
Go to IAP
To begin setting up your connector deployment for an on-premises app, click Connect new application and select Connect via on-prem connector .
To ensure that the required APIs are enabled, click Enable APIs and continue in the right-side panel.
Select the configuration details and click Next :
Choose whether the deployment should use a Google-managed certificate or one
managed by you.
Select the network and subnet for the deployment (or choose
to create a new one).
Complete the following details for the on-premises app you want to add:
Enter the external URL of requests coming to Google Cloud. This URL is
where traffic enters the environment.
Enter a name for the app, which will also serve as the name for a new
backend service behind the load
balancer.
Select the region.
Provide the on-premises endpoint type and its details:
Fully qualified domain name (FQDN): The domain where the connector should forward the traffic.
IP address: One or more zones where the IAP connector should be
deployed (for example, us-central1-a ). For each zone, specify the IPv4 address of
the internal destination for the on-premises app to which
IAP routes traffic after a user is authorized and
authenticated.
Note: If your on-premises endpoint is an IP address, consider using a hybrid connectivity network endpoint group directly with a load balancer instead of using the IAP on-premises connector.
Select the protocol used by the on-premises endpoint.
Enter the port number used by the on-premises endpoint, such as 443 for HTTPS or 80 for HTTP.
To save the details for that app, click Done . You can also
define additional on-premises apps for the deployment.
To begin deployment of the apps you've defined, click Submit .
After the deployment is complete, your on-premises connector apps appear in the
Applications table and you can enable IAP.
If you choose to let Google auto-generate and manage the certificates, it might
take a few minutes for the certificates to provision. You can check the status
at the Cloud Load Balancing detail page. For more information about the
status, see
troubleshooting page .
Manage a connector for an on-premises app
To add more apps to your deployment, click
Connect new application and then Connect via on-prem connector .
To delete the on-premises connector by deleting the entire
deployment, do the following:
Go to the Deployment Manager page.
Go to Deployment Manager
In the list of deployments, select the checkbox next to the
"on-prem-app-deployment" deployment.
On the top of the page, click Delete .
To delete individual apps, click the delete button in the
Applications tab.
The on-premises connector must contains at least one app. To remove all apps, delete the entire deployment.
Next steps
Set richer context rules by applying access levels .
