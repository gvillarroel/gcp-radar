This page shows you how to enable and use the Policy Remediator.
When users attempt to access a Google Cloud resource but aren't compliant with
the access policy for the resource, they are denied access and receive a general
403 error message. You can use the Policy Remediator to provide users with
actionable steps that they can take to remediate their issue before reaching out
to an administrator for additional help. The specific remediation actions depend on the
access policies, but can include things such as enabling screen lock, updating
the operating system (OS) version, or accessing an app from a network allowed by
your company.
Enable Policy Remediator
Grant your organization administrator the
roles/policyremediatormanager.policyRemediatorAdmin role at the
organization level by running the following commands in the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding 'organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID ' \
--member PRINCIPAL \
--role roles/policyremediatormanager.policyRemediatorAdmin
Replace the following:
ORGANIZATION_ID : the Google Cloud organization ID.
PRINCIPAL : the identifier for the principal, or member, which
usually has the following form: PRINCIPAL_TYPE:ID . For example,
user:my-user@example.com .
Enable the Policy Remediator Manager API by running the following command:
gcloud services enable policyremediatormanager.googleapis.com
Call the Policy Remediator Manager to enable Policy Remediator for the
projects in an organization, this creates a service agent .
curl -X POST \
"https://policyremediatormanager.googleapis.com/v1alpha/organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /locations/global/remediatorService:enable" \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN ' \
--header 'X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID '
Replace the following:
ORGANIZATION_ID : the Google Cloud organization ID.
ACCESS_TOKEN : use the following command to generate the access token.
gcloud auth print-access-token
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID.
Following is an example response, which contains the service agent details:
{
"name": "organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /locations/global/operations/ ",
"metadata": {
"@type":
"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.policyremediatormanager.remediatorservicemanager.v1alph
a.OperationMetadata",
"createTime": " ",
"target": "organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /locations/global/remediatorService",
"verb": "update",
"requestedCancellation": false,
"apiVersion": "v1alpha"
},
"done": false
}
Where ORGANIZATION_ID is the Google Cloud organization ID.
In the Google Cloud CLI, run the following command to access the service agent that you created:
curl -X GET \
"https://policyremediatormanager.googleapis.com/v1alpha/organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /locations/global/remediatorService" \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN ' \
--header 'X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID '
Replace the following:
ORGANIZATION_ID : the Google Cloud organization ID.
ACCESS_TOKEN : use the following command to generate the access token.
gcloud auth print-access-token
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID.
You should receive the service agent email in the following format:
{
"name": "organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /locations/global/remediatorService",
"state": "ENABLED",
"serviceAccountEmail": "service-org- ORGANIZATION_ID @gcp-sa-v1-remediator.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
Where ORGANIZATION_ID is the Google Cloud organization ID.

In the Google Cloud CLI, run the following commands to grant the Service Agent
( policyremediator.serviceAgent ) role to the service agent at the
organization level. This gives the service agent permission to read the
Identity and Access Management and other access policies for your organization.
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding 'organizations/ ' \
--member='serviceAccount:service-org- ORGANIZATION_ID @gcp-sa-v1-remediator.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--role='roles/policyremediator.serviceAgent'

To give users permission to remediate denied access to IAP resources,
run the following command in the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud iap web add-iam-policy-binding \
--member=' PRINCIPAL ' \
--role='roles/iap.remediatorUser'
Replace PRINCIPAL with an identifier for the principal, or member,
which usually has the following form: PRINCIPAL_TYPE:ID . For example,
user:my-user@example.com .
For additional information, see gcloud IAP web add-iam-policy-binding .
To give users permission to remediate access to IAP resources at a project level,
run the following command in the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member PRINCIPAL \
--role roles/iap.remediatorUser
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the Google Cloud project ID.

Remediate with the Help Desk
When end users are denied access, they are redirected to a Chrome Enterprise Premium page

remediation token. If users don't have permission to open the remediation token,
they can copy the remediation token and send it to the Help Desk for additional
help.
