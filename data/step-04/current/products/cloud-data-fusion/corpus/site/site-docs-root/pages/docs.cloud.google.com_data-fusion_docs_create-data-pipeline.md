Create a data pipeline
This quickstart shows you how to do the following:
Create a Cloud Data Fusion instance.
Deploy a sample pipeline that's provided with your Cloud Data Fusion
instance. The pipeline does the following:
Reads a JSON file containing NYT bestseller data from
Cloud Storage.
Runs transformations on the file to parse and clean the data.
Loads the top-rated books added in the last week that cost less than $25
into BigQuery.
Before you begin
Complete the following steps before creating a data pipeline.
Set up your project
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Enable the Cloud Data Fusion API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .

Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create a Cloud Data Fusion instance and manage pipelines,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Cloud Data Fusion Admin ( roles/datafusion.admin )
IAM role on the project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
To ensure that the Compute Engine default service account has the necessary
permissions to run the Managed Service for Apache Spark job,
ask your administrator to grant the
following IAM roles to the Compute Engine default service account on your project:
Important: You must grant these roles
to the Compute Engine default service account, not to your user account. Failure to grant the roles to the correct principal might result in permission errors.
Dataproc Worker ( roles/dataproc.worker )
Cloud Data Fusion Runner ( roles/datafusion.runner )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Your administrator might also be able to give the Compute Engine default service account
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create a Cloud Data Fusion instance
Click Create an instance .
Go to Instances
Enter an Instance name .
Enter a Description for your instance.
Enter the Region in which to create the instance.
Choose the Cloud Data Fusion Version to use.
Choose the Cloud Data Fusion Edition .
For Cloud Data Fusion versions 6.2.3 and later, in the
Authorization field, choose the Managed Service for Apache Spark service account
to use for running your Cloud Data Fusion pipeline in
Managed Service for Apache Spark. The default value, Compute Engine account, is
pre-selected.
Click Create .
It takes up to 30 minutes for the instance creation process to complete.
While Cloud Data Fusion creates your instance, a progress wheel
displays next to the instance name on the Instances page. After
completion, it turns into a green check mark and indicates
that you can start using the instance.
Navigate the Cloud Data Fusion web interface
When using Cloud Data Fusion, you use both the Google Cloud console
and the separate Cloud Data Fusion web interface.
In the Google Cloud console, you can do the following:
Create a Google Cloud console project
Create and delete Cloud Data Fusion instances
View the Cloud Data Fusion instance details
In the Cloud Data Fusion web interface, you can use various pages, such
as Studio or Wrangler , to use Cloud Data Fusion functionality.
To navigate the Cloud Data Fusion interface, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, open the Instances page.
Go to Instances
In the instance Actions column, click the View Instance link.
In the Cloud Data Fusion web interface, use the left navigation panel to
navigate to the page you need.
Deploy a sample pipeline
Sample pipelines are available through the Cloud Data Fusion Hub ,
which lets you share reusable Cloud Data Fusion pipelines, plugins,
and solutions.
In the Cloud Data Fusion web interface, click Hub .
In the left panel, click Pipelines .
Click the Cloud Data Fusion Quickstart pipeline.
Click Create .
In the Cloud Data Fusion Quickstart configuration panel, click Finish .
Click Customize Pipeline .
A visual representation of your pipeline appears on the Studio page,
which is a graphical interface for developing data integration pipelines.
Available pipeline plugins are listed on the left, and your pipeline is
displayed on the main canvas area. You can explore your pipeline by holding
the pointer over each pipeline node and clicking Properties . The
properties menu for each node lets you view the objects and operations
associated with the node.
In the top-right menu, click Deploy . This step submits the pipeline to
Cloud Data Fusion. You will execute the pipeline in the next section of
this quickstart.
View your pipeline
The deployed pipeline appears in the pipeline details view, where you can do
the following:
View the structure and configuration of the pipeline.
Run the pipeline manually or set up a schedule or a trigger.
View a summary of historical runs of the pipeline, including execution
times, logs, and metrics.
Execute your pipeline
In the pipeline details view, click Run to execute your pipeline.
When executing a pipeline, Cloud Data Fusion does the following:
Provisions an ephemeral Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster
Executes the pipeline on the cluster using Apache Spark
Deletes the cluster
Note: When the pipeline transitions to the Running state, you can
monitor the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster creation and deletion . This cluster only exists for the duration of
the pipeline.
View the results
After a few minutes, the pipeline finishes. The pipeline status changes to
Succeeded and the number of records processed by each node is displayed.
Go to the BigQuery web interface .
To view a sample of the results, go to the DataFusionQuickstart dataset
in your project, click the
top_rated_inexpensive table, then run a simple query. For example:
SELECT * FROM PROJECT_ID .GCPQuickStart.top_rated_inexpensive LIMIT 10
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
Delete the BigQuery dataset
that your pipeline wrote to in this quickstart.
Delete the Cloud Data Fusion instance .
Note: Deleting your instance does not delete any of your data in
the project.
Optional: Delete the project.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
