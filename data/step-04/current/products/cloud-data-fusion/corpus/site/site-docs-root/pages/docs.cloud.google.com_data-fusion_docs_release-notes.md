Role-based access control in Cloud Data Fusion supports using the Cloud Data Fusion API Service Agent service account while emitting lineage events in RBAC-enabled instances. For more information, see View lineage in Dataplex .
To create ephemeral clusters, Cloud Data Fusion uses the Dataproc 2.1 image by default. For more information about its limitations in Cloud Data Fusion, see Change the Dataproc image to version 2.1 ( CDAP-20841 ).
Cloud Data Fusion uses the autoscaling Dataproc profile by default for ephemeral clusters.
In Source control management , GitHub PAT was removed from the Cloud Data Fusion web interface for repository configurations ( CDAP-20904 and CDAP-20581 ).
Improved latency when BigQuery pushdown is enabled by fetching artifacts from a local cache ( CDAP-20846 ).
The BigQuery sink supports flexible table names and column names ( PLUGIN-1718 ).
BigQuery sinks support ingesting data to JSON data type fields( PLUGIN-1692 ).

December 22, 2023
Fixed
The Salesforce plugin version 1.6.2 is available in Cloud Data Fusion versions 6.8.0 and later. This version includes the following changes:
Fixed an issue in the Salesforce plugin causing the following error in some pipelines that run more than 4 hours: java.lang.IllegalStateException: SSLException reading next record: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Connection reset . The Connection timeout property was added to the Salesforce plugin properties in the web interface with the default value of 3600 seconds ( PLUGIN-1719 ).
For accuracy, fixed schema handling for referenced object fields: child fields are explicitly marked as non-nullable, regardless of the schema values in the referenced object.
In earlier versions, when retrieving schema information for fields in referenced objects, such as contact.account_lastmodifieddate , the schema inherits properties from the referenced object, causing incorrect non-nullable assumptions ( PLUGIN-1720 ).
A retry mechanism was added in the Salesforce batch source and Multi-Source plugins for connection timeout issues ( PLUGIN-1706 ).
December 19, 2023

June 14, 2023
Feature
Cloud Data Fusion version 6.9.1 is in Preview . This release is in parallel with the CDAP 6.9.1 release .
Feature
Features in Cloud Data Fusion 6.9.1:
Cloud Data Fusion supports using Source Control Management to manage pipeline versions through GitHub repositories. Source Control Management is available in Preview ( CDAP-20228 ).
Data Catalog Asset Lineage Integration is in GA in versions 6.8.0 and later. In version 6.9.1, it supports the Multiple Database Tables source and the BigQuery Multi Table sink.
Cloud Data Fusion supports editing deployed pipelines ( CDAP-19425 ).
Cloud Data Fusion supports Window Aggregation operations in Transformation Pushdown to reduce the pipeline execution time by performing SQL operations in BigQuery instead of Spark ( CDAP-19628 ).
Cloud Data Fusion supports specifying filters in SQL in Wrangler and the pushdown of SQL filters in Wrangler to BigQuery. In the Wrangler transformation, added support for specifying preconditions in SQL, and added support for transformation pushdown for SQL preconditions. For more information, see Wrangler Filter Pushdown ( CDAP-20454 ).
Cloud Data Fusion supports Dataproc driver node groups . To use Dataproc driver node groups, when you create the Dataproc cluster , configure the following properties:
yarn:yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory.enforced=false
yarn:yarn.nodemanager.admin-env.SPARK_HOME=$SPARK_HOME
Note: The single quotation marks are important in the property when using the gcloud CLI to create the cluster ( 'yarn:yarn.nodemanager.admin-env.SPARK_HOME=$SPARK_HOME' ) so that the shell doesn't try to resolve the $ locally before submitting ( CDAP-20288 ).
For the Multiple Database Tables Batch Source , added field-level lineage support ( CDAP-20440 ).
Cloud Data Fusion version 6.9.1 supports the Dataproc image 2.1 compute engine, which runs in Java11. If you change the Dataproc image to 2.1 , the JDBC drivers that the database plugins use in those instances must be compatible with Java11 ( CDAP-20543 ).
Cloud Data Fusion supports the following improvements and changes for real time pipelines with a single Pub/Sub streaming source and no Windower plugins:
The Pub/Sub streaming source has built-in support—data is processed at least once.
Enabling Spark checkpointing isn't required. Pub/Sub streaming source creates a Pub/Sub snapshot at the beginning of each batch and removes it at the end of each batch.
The Pub/Sub Snapshot creation has a cost associated with it. For more information, see Pub/Sub pricing .
The snapshot creations can be monitored using Cloud Audit logs .
For more information, see Read from a Pub/Sub streaming source ( PLUGIN-1537 ).
Change
Changes in Cloud Data Fusion 6.9.1:
Updated Cloud Data Fusion docker image dependencies to include fixes for security vulnerabilities.
Added the ability to configure Java options for a pipeline run by setting the system.program.jvm.opts runtime argument ( CDAP-20381 ).
Replication pipelines generate logs for stats of events processed by source and target plugins at a fixed interval ( CDAP-20140 ).
Streaming pipelines that use Spark checkpointing can use macros if the cdap.streaming.allow.source.macros runtime argument is set to true. Note that macro evaluation will only be performed for the first run in this case, then stored in the checkpoint. It will not be re-evaluated in later runs ( CDAP-20455 ).
Improved performance of replication pipelines by caching schema objects for data events ( CDAP-20488 ).
Added a launch mode setting to the Dataproc provisioners. When set to Client mode, the program launcher will run in the Dataproc job itself, and not as a separate YARN application. This reduces start-up time and cluster resources required, but may cause failures if the launcher needs more memory, such as when there's an action plugin that loads data into memory ( CDAP-20500 ).
Removed duplicate backend calls when a program reads from the secure store ( CDAP-20504 ).
Added support to upgrade Pipeline Post-run Action (Pipeline Alerts) plugins during the pipeline upgrade process ( CDAP-20567 ).
Added Lifecycle microservices endpoint to delete a streaming application state for Kafka Consumer Streaming and Google Cloud Pub/Sub Streaming sources ( CDAP-20466 ).
Fixed
Fixed in Cloud Data Fusion 6.9.1:
For SQL Server replication sources, fixed an issue on the Review assessment page, where SQL Server DATETIME and DATETIME2 columns were shown as mapped to TIMESTAMP columns in BigQuery. This was a UI bug. The replication job mapped the data types to the BigQuery DATETIME type ( CDAP-19389 ).
For replication jobs, fixed an issue where retries for transient errors from BigQuery might have resulted in data inconsistency ( CDAP-20276 ).
Fixed an issue where a replication job got stuck in an infinite retry when it failed to process a DDL operation ( CDAP-20301 ).
When you duplicate a pipeline, Cloud Data Fusion appends _copy to the pipeline name when it opens in the Pipeline Studio. In previous releases, Cloud Data Fusion appended _<v1, v2, v3> to the name ( CDAP-20373 ).
Fixed the pipeline stage validation API to return unevaluated macro values to prevent secure macros from being returned ( CDAP-20430 ).
Fixed an issue that sometimes caused pipelines to fail when running pipelines on Dataproc with the following error: Unsupported program type: Spark . The first time a pipeline that only contained actions ran on a newly created or upgraded instance, it succeeded. However, the next pipeline runs, which included sources or sinks, might have failed with this error ( CDAP-20431 ).
Fixed an issue where the flow control running count metric ( system.flowcontrol.running.count ) might be stale if no new pipelines or replication jobs were started ( CDAP-20458 ).
Fixed an issue where executor resource settings are not honored when app.pipeline.overwriteConfig is set ( CDAP-20549 ).
In the Oracle batch source, the Oracle NUMBER data type defined without precision and scale by default was mapped to Cloud Data Fusion string data type. If these fields were used by an Oracle Sink to insert into a NUMBER data type field in the Oracle table, the pipeline failed due to incompatibility between string and NUMBER type. Now, the Oracle Sink inserts these string types into NUMBER fields in the Oracle table ( PLUGIN-1481 ).
For Oracle batch sources, fixed an issue that caused the pipeline to fail when there was a TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE column set to NULLABLE and the source had values that were NULL( PLUGIN-1494 ) .
Fixed an issue where pipelines that had a Database batch source and an Oracle sink that used a connection object (using SYSDBA) to connect to an Oracle database failed to establish a connection to the Oracle database. This was due to a package conflict between the Database batch source and the Oracle sink plugins ( PLUGIN-1503 ).
Fixed an issue where pipelines failed when the output schema was overridden in certain source plugins. This was because the output schema didn't match the order of the fields from the query. This happened when the pipeline included any of the following batch sources:
Database
Oracle
MySQL
SQL Server
PostgreSQL
DB2
MariaDB
Netezza
Cloud SQL PostgreSQL
Cloud SQL MySQL
Teradata
Pipelines no longer fail when you override the output schema in these source plugins. Cloud Data Fusion uses the name of the field to match the schema of the field in the result set and the field in the output schema { PLUGIN-1512 ).
For BigQuery Pushdown, fixed an issue when BigQuery Pushdown was enabled for an existing dataset, the Location where the BigQuery Sink executed jobs was the location specified in the Pushdown configuration, not the BigQuery Dataset location. The configured Location should have only been used when creating resources. Now, if the dataset already exists, the Location for the existing dataset is used ( PLUGIN-1513 ).
For the Database sink, fixed an issue where the pipeline didn't fail if there was an error writing data to the database. Now, if there is an error writing data to the database, the pipeline fails and no data is written to the database ( PLUGIN-1514 ).
Fixed an issue that checks GET permission on a namespace which does not exist yet during the namespace creation flow ( CDAP-18394 ).
Fixed an issue where Dataproc continued running a job when it couldn't communicate with the Cloud Data Fusion instance if the replication job or pipeline was deleted in Cloud Data Fusion ( CDAP-20216 ).
Fixed an issue that caused pipelines with triggers with runtime arguments to fail after the instance was upgraded to Cloud Data Fusion 6.8.0 and 6.9.0 ( CDAP-20568 ).
Fixed an issue where arguments set by actions and pipeline triggers don't overwrite runtime arguments. You must add the following runtime argument: system.skip.normal.macro.evaluation=true ( CDAP-20597 ).
Fixed an issue that caused the Pipeline Studio page to show an incorrect count of triggers ( CDAP-20655 ).
Fixed an issue that caused the Trigger's Payload Config to be missing in the UI for an upgraded instance ( CDAP-20660 ).
Fixed bug where initial offset was not considered in Kafka batch source ( PLUGIN-1594 ).
Deprecated
With the introduction of editing deployed pipelines in Cloud Data Fusion 6.9.1, the behavior of some APIs have significantly changed. Due to these changes, some APIs are deprecated ( CDAP-20030 ).
Deprecated
In Cloud Data Fusion 6.9.1, all datasets except FileSet and ExternalDataset are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. All the deprecated datasets use the Table dataset in some form, which only works for programs running with the native provisioner on very old Hadoop releases ( CDAP-20667 ).

Fixed
Fixed in 6.8.3:
Fixed an issue where the event publish feature did not work with RBAC-enabled instances ( CDAP-20375 ).
Fixed an issue where executor resource settings were not honored when app.pipeline.overwriteConfig was set ( CDAP-20549 ).
Fixed an issue that caused pipelines with triggers with runtime arguments to fail after the instance was upgraded to Cloud Data Fusion 6.8.0 and later ( CDAP-20568 ).
Fixed an issue where arguments set by actions and pipeline triggers don't overwrite runtime arguments. You must add the following runtime argument: system.skip.normal.macro.evaluation=true ( CDAP-20597 ).
Fixed an issue that caused the Studio page to show an incorrect count of triggers ( CDAP-20655 ).
Fixed an issue that caused the Trigger's Payload Config to be missing in the UI for an upgraded instance ( CDAP-20660 ).
Fixed an issue in the BigQuery Sink where the absence of an ordering key caused an exception ( PLUGIN-1582 ).
Fixed an issue where initial offset was not considered in the Kafka Batch Source ( PLUGIN-1594 ).

Oracle plugins version 1.8.6 is available in Cloud Data Fusion versions 6.7.1, 6.7.2, and 6.7.3. Oracle plugins version 1.9.2 is available in Cloud Data Fusion versions 6.8.0 and later. These plugin versions have the following changes:
For the Oracle Batch Source , fixed a backward compatibility issue. In plugin versions 1.8.3, 1.9.0, and earlier, Cloud Data Fusion maps the Oracle NUMBER data type with undefined precision and scale to CDAP decimal(38,0) , which can cause data loss due to rounding errors. In plugin versions 1.8.4, 1.8.5, and 1.9.1, the Oracle NUMBER data type with undefined precision and scale maps to the CDAP string data type by default, which preserves all decimal digits. In versions 1.8.6 and 1.9.2, the Oracle NUMBER data type with undefined precision and scale gets mapped to CDAP string by default and lets you edit the output schema to use the older mapping to decimal(38, 0) data type.

Change
Changes in Cloud Data Fusion 6.8.1:
Cloud Data Fusion supports upgrades for real-time pipelines that have a Kafka Consumer Streaming source from version 6.8.0 to 6.8.1 after you upgrade your environment .
Starting in Cloud Data Fusion 6.8.1, Dataproc clusters require the following OAUTH scope to function: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform . This scope is no longer required as of March 29, 2023 .
March 17, 2023 release note addition: The Oracle Batch Source version 1.9.1 (which comes with Cloud Data Fusion 6.8.1) reads the Oracle NUMBER data type with undefined precision and scale as a string in Cloud Data Fusion. In previous versions, Cloud Data Fusion reads the Oracle NUMBER data type with undefined precision and scale as decimal (38,0) , which could result in data loss. For more information, see Troubleshooting ( PLUGIN-1119 ).
Change
March 17, 2023 release note addition: The Oracle Batch Source version 1.8.5 (which comes with Cloud Data Fusion 6.7.3) reads the Oracle NUMBER data type with undefined precision and scale as a string in Cloud Data Fusion. In plugin versions 1.8.3 and earlier, Cloud Data Fusion reads the Oracle NUMBER data type with undefined precision and scale as decimal (38,0) , which could result in data loss. For more information, see Troubleshooting ( PLUGIN-1119 ).
Feature
Cloud Data Fusion version 6.7.3 is generally available ( GA ). This release is in parallel with the CDAP 6.7.3 release .
Fixed
Fixed in 6.7.3:
Fixed an issue that allowed reading secure keys in the system namespace with only the Data Fusion Viewer role ( datafusion.viewer ) or Instance Accessor role ( datafusion.accessor ). For more information about predefined roles for role-based access control in Cloud Data Fusion, see the Role-based access control (RBAC) overview .
Fixed an issue in the BigQuery Replication Target plugin that caused Replication jobs to fail when the BigQuery target table already existed. The new version of the plugin will automatically be used in new Replication jobs ( CDAP-19599 ).
Fixed an issue that prevented upgrades for MySQL and SQL Server Replication jobs in version 6.6.0. Upgrades are supported from version 6.6.0 to 6.7.3 and 6.8.1 ( CDAP-19622 ).
Fixed an issue that prevented upgrades for Oracle by Datastream Replication jobs in version 6.6.0. Upgrades are supported from versions 6.6.0 , 6.7.0, 6.7.1, and 6.7.2 to version 6.7.3 ( CDAP-20013 ).
Fixed an issue that caused pipelines to fail if they used a connection property, such as the Service Account JSON property, which used a secure macro with JSON as the value ( CDAP-20271 ).
Fixed an issue that occurred in certain upgrade scenarios, where pipelines didn't have the Use Connection property set and the UI didn't display a plugin's connection properties, such as Project ID and Service Account Type ( CDAP-20392 ).

Fixed an error in security-enabled instances that caused pipeline launch to fail and return a token expired error when evaluating secure macros in provisioner properties ( CDAP-20146 ).
In the Oracle Batch Source (version 1.8.4 and earlier), when the source data included fields with the NUMBER data type with undefined precision and scale, Cloud Data Fusion read it as decimal and set the precision to 38 and the scale to 0 . If any values in the field had scale other than 0 , values were rounded, which could have resulted in data loss. If the scale for this field is overridden in the plugin output schema, the pipeline fails. In Oracle batch source version 1.8.5, you can edit the scale of the CDAP decimal data type in the output schema. The overridden value is used to map to the Oracle NUMBER data type without failing the pipeline. If there are any numbers present in the fields with a scale greater than the scale defined in the plugin, Cloud Data Fusion rounds the values based on the scale you set in the output schema. For example, if you specify precision=10 , scale=3 , the value 123.4567 is rounded to 123.457 . For more information about setting precision and scale in a plugin, see Changing the precision and scale for decimal fields in the output schema ( PLUGIN-1433 ).
Improved performance for batch pipelines with MySQL sinks ( PLUGIN-1374 ).
For Database plugins (version 2.9.3), fixed a security issue where the database username and password were exposed in the logs ( CDAP-20235 ).

Cloud Data Fusion version 6.8.0 is in Preview . This release is in parallel with the CDAP 6.8.0 release .
Change
In Cloud Data Fusion 6.8.0, Reference name is no longer mandatory for the following plugins:
BigQuery Source
BigQuery Sink
Dataplex Source
Dataplex Sink
Spanner Sink
Cloud Storage Sink
For these plugins, their unique identifiers in lineage are generated based on their configuration properties. For example, project ID+dataset+table is used as a unique identifier for BigQuery. This identifier can be seen on the lineage diagram. For more information, see Cloud Data Fusion Plugins .
Feature
Features in 6.8.0:
Replication from Oracle to BigQuery using Datastream is generally available ( GA ).
Cloud Data Fusion supports BigQuery batch source pushdown .
Cloud Data Fusion supports AND triggers . You can create OR and AND triggers. Previously, all triggers were OR triggers.
Change
Changes in 6.8.0:
For Replication jobs with an Oracle (by Datastream) source , ensured data consistency when multiple CDC events are generated with the same timestamp, by ordering events reliably.
For Oracle replication sources, added a purge policy for a Cloud Storage bucket created by the plugin where Datastream writes its output.
In the Oracle replication source , added the GCS Bucket Location property, where Datastream writes its output.
In the Oracle replication source , added the list of Datastream regions to the Region property. You no longer need to manually enter the Datastream region.
The Oracle replication source identifies each row by the Primary key of the table. Previously, the plugin identified each row by the ROWID .
For Replication jobs, improved performance for Review Assessment.
Splitter Transformation based plugins have access to prepareRun() and onRunFinish() methods.
In Wrangler, added the Average arithmetic function, which calculates the average of the selected columns.
In Wrangler, Numeric functions support 3 or more columns.
In the Dataplex Sink plugin, added the Update Dataplex Metadata property, which adds support for updating metadata in Dataplex for newly generated data.
In the GCS Delete Action plugin, added support for bulk deletion of files and folders. You can use the ( * ) wildcard character to represent any character.
Fixed
Fixed in 6.8.0:
For custom Dataproc compute profiles, fixed the issue causing the wrong Cloud Storage bucket to be used to stage data. Cloud Data Fusion uses the bucket specified in the custom compute profile.
Fixed the issue in the BigQuery Replication Target plugin causing Replication jobs to fail when the BigQuery target table already existed. The new version of the plugin is used by default in new Replication jobs. To use the new plugin version in existing jobs, recreate the job.
Fixed an issue causing the Replication Assessment to get stuck when the Oracle (by Datastream) storage bucket property was empty, or had an invalid bucket name. Cloud Data Fusion returns a 400 error code during assessment when the property is empty or has an invalid bucket name.
Fixed an issue causing Replication jobs to fail when the source column name didn't comply with BigQuery table naming conventions. In 6.8.0, if a source column name doesn't comply with BigQuery naming conventions, Cloud Data Fusion replaces invalid characters with an underscore, prepends an underscore when the first character is a number, and truncates the name when it exceeds the maximum length.
In the File batch source, fixed an issue causing Get Schema to appear only when Format was set to delimited . Get Schema appears for all formats.
Fixed an issue with the output schema when connecting a Splitter transformation with a Joiner transformation.
Fixed an issue causing imports in the Cloud Data Fusion UI to fail for pipelines exported through the Pipeline Microservices.
In the Oracle Batch Source, when the source data included fields with the Numeric data type (undefined precision and scale), Cloud Data Fusion set the precision to 38 and the scale to 0 . If any values in the field had scale other than 0 , Cloud Data Fusion truncated the values, which could have resulted in data loss. If the scale for a field was overridden in the plugin output schema, the pipeline failed. For more information, see the CDAP 6.8.0 bug fixes .
In the Wrangler transformation, fixed the issue causing the pipeline to not fail when the Error Handling property was set to Fail Pipeline . This happened when an error was returned, but no exception was thrown, and there were 0 records in the output. For example, this happened when one of the directives (such as.parse-as-simple-date ) failed because the input data wasn't in the correct format. This fix is not available by default. Instead, contact support if you need this fix for your projects.
In Wrangler, fixed the issue causing the Wrangler page to get stuck when a BigQuery table name contained non-alphanumeric characters, such as underscores. Wrangler imports BigQuery tables that follow BigQuery table naming conventions .

Fixed an issue where the Log service left empty folders, which made the mounting of Persistent Disk slow. This caused the Log service not to start in a timely manner.
Fixed an issue that caused pipelines to take a long time to launch or get stuck. This was linked to I/O throttling that occurred on the underlying Persistent Disk.
Fixed an issue that caused pipelines to fail when two or more pipelines were scheduled to start simultaneously on a static Dataproc cluster. This was due to a file upload race condition.
Fixed an issue in flow control that caused Appfabric to return a 5xx error code in rare scenarios, instead of 429 (Too Many Requests Error) , if the number of concurrently launching or running pipelines was above certain thresholds.
Fixed an issue that resulted in an error when a compute profile was exported from the default namespace after switching from a custom namespace.
Delete, edit, and export no longer appear as operations for pre-configured connections in Cloud Data Fusion. You can view connection details for those connections.
Fixed an issue when you started a pipeline multiple times, and then stopped the pipeline before it completed, which resulted in the following UI error: Program <program name> is not running .
Removed verbose logs from the BigQuery client libraries in pipeline logs.
Fixed an issue that caused the BigQuery Execute action plugin configured with an Encryption Key Name ( CMEK ) to fail when the SQL query contained DDL Statements.
In the BigQuery Execute action plugin , added the property Store Results in a BigQuery Table to the UI, which hides the destination table related properties by default.

Preview : Cloud Data Fusion now supports customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) , which provide user encryption control over the data written to Google internal resources in tenant projects, and data written by Cloud Data Fusion pipelines.
Preview : Cloud Data Fusion Instance Admins can now create, view, duplicate, delete, import, and export connections from the Pipeline Studio, Wrangler, or the Namespace Admin page. A connection stores sensitive data, such as user credentials and host information, needed to connect to data sources. For more information, see Managing connections .
Preview : Transformation pushdown is now available. It helps you efficiently design and execute ELT workloads by pushing join transformations down to BigQuery. It gives users that prefer ELT in BigQuery access to the same visual experience that ETL users get in Cloud Data Fusion, without needing to maintain complex SQL scripts. When you enable Transformation pushdown, Cloud Data Fusion executes Join operations in BigQuery (instead of Apache Spark). All other stages in a pipeline are executed using Spark. For pipelines that perform multiple complex joins, BigQuery can execute these joins operations faster than Spark.
Preview : Dataproc cluster reuse is now available. It can be used to speed up pipeline run startup by reusing clusters from previous runs.
Change
Changes in 6.5.0:
In version 6.5.0, Spark 3 is the new default engine used when using Cloud Data Fusion Preview and when running pipelines on Dataproc clusters. After an instance is upgraded to version 6.5.0, any new or upgraded pipeline that uses a Dataproc profile without an explicit image version will use the latest Dataproc image 2.0 that has Spark 3.1 bundled. For more information, see Upgrade notes for Spark 3 .
Added support for labels in the Dataproc provisioner.
Added Shielded VMs to the configuration settings for the Dataproc provisioner. For more information, see the CDAP documentation .
Added authorization checks for preferences, logging, compute profiles, and metadata endpoints.
Added support to search for tables based on schema name when you select tables for a Replication job.
Added additional trace logging in the authorization flow for debugging.
Added support for BIGNUMERIC data type for BigQuery target in replication.
Behavior change : MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and SQL Server batch sources, sinks, actions, and pipeline alerts are now installed by default as system plugins. Previously, these plugins were available in the Hub as user plugins.
Issue
You can create connections for Database, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server sources, but the plugin properties do not include Use Connection . This means that you cannot reference a connection in a database source plugin. For more information, see Known issues: Database connections .
Fixed
Fixed in 6.5.0 preview version (for more information, see the CDAP release note ):
Fixed an issue in Replication that caused jobs to fail if more than 1000 tables were selected for replication.
Fixed an issue that caused replication jobs to hang when there were too many Delete or DDL events.
Fixed an issue that caused Wrangler to ignore all the other columns other than the given column when parsing Excel files.
Fixed Wrangler to fail pipelines upon error. In Wrangler 6.2 and above, there was a backwards-incompatible change where pipelines did not fail if there was an error and instead were marked as completed.
Improved resilience of TMS .
Fixed an issue that caused File Source Plugin validation to fail when there was a macro in the Format field.
August 16, 2021
Change
SQL Server source plugin version 1.5.5 is now available. This version fixes a NullPointerException bug that occurs in version 1.5.4. Versions 1.5.4 and above support the Datetime data type. In versions 1.5.3 and earlier, if you had a Datetime column in your SQL Server source, it mapped to the Timestamp data type. Upgrades to version 1.5.4 are backwards incompatible, but upgrades to version 1.5.5 are compatible. For more information, see Troubleshooting and the CDAP SQL Server Batch Source .
June 23, 2021
Feature
Preview: You can now replicate data continuously and in real time from operational data stores in Oracle into BigQuery using the Oracle (by Datastream) plugin. The plugin is available in Cloud Data Fusion version 6.4.0 or later.

Fixed an issue that caused pipelines with aggregations and Decimal fields to fail with an exception.
Fixed the Join Condition Type so that it is displayed in the Joiner plugin for pipelines that were upgraded from versions before 6.4.0.
Fixed Wrangler so that pipelines fail when there is an error. In Wrangler 6.2 and above, there was a backwards-incompatible change where pipelines did not fail if there was an error and were instead marked as complete.
Fixed an issue that prevented new previews from being scheduled after the preview manager had been stopped ten times.
Fixed an issue while writing non-null values to a nullable field in BigQuery.
Fixed an issue in the BigQuery plugins to correctly delete temporary storage buckets.

Change
Changed in version 6.4.0:
Behavior change: When you validate a plugin, macros get resolved with preferences. In previous releases, to validate a plugin's configuration, you had to change the pipeline to remove the macros.
Behavior change: Cloud Data Fusion now determines the schema dynamically at runtime instead of requiring arguments to be set. Multi sink runtime argument requirements have been removed, which lets you add simple transformations in multi-source/multi-sink pipelines. In previous releases, multi-sink plugins require the pipeline to set a runtime argument for each table, with the schema for each table.
You can now filter tables in the Multiple Database Tables Batch Source .
Multiple Database Batch Source and BigQuery multi-table sink have better error handling and let pipelines continue if one or more tables fail.
