Create a private instance with VPC peering
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create a Cloud Data Fusion instance with an
internal IP address. You create the instance in a
VPC network or a
Shared VPC network.
Note: In Cloud Data Fusion 6.10.0 and later, we recommend creating private
instances with
Private Service Connect ,
not with VPC network peering.
A private Cloud Data Fusion instance has the following benefits:
Connections to the instance are established over a
private VPC network in your Google Cloud project.
Traffic over the network doesn't go through the public internet.
The instance can connect to your on-premises resources, such as relational
databases because your on-premises network connects to the
Google Cloud private VPC network through
Cloud VPN or
Cloud Interconnect .
You can securely access your on-premises resources, such as databases, over
the private network without opening up access to Google Cloud.
Objectives
Set up the VPC network or the Shared VPC network.
Allocate an IP range that will be used to deploy the Cloud Data Fusion
instance in the tenant project.
Create the Cloud Data Fusion private instance.
Set up the VPC network peering between the VPC that
contains the Cloud Data Fusion instance and the VPC that
contains the associated tenant project.
For Shared VPC networks, set up Identity and Access Management (IAM)
permissions.
If your private instance uses Cloud Data Fusion version 6.2.0 or
earlier, create a firewall rule.
Let different Google Cloud services communicate internally with each
other by enabling Private Google Access on the
Managed Service for Apache Spark subnet.
Before you begin
To learn about Cloud Data Fusion's deployment architecture, see
Networking .
Set up the VPC network
If you haven't already done so, create a VPC network
or a Shared VPC network .
To set up your VPC network, you must allocate an IP address
range.
Allocate an IP range
VPC network
If you're not using a Shared VPC network,
Cloud Data Fusion allocates an IP range by default when you create an
instance.
Note: If you're not using a Shared VPC network, skip this
section and go to Create a private instance .
Shared VPC network
Note: Follow these steps only if you're using a Shared VPC network.
To use a Shared VPC you must allocate an IP
range for your Cloud Data Fusion instance.
To allocate an IP range for your Cloud Data Fusion instance, follow
these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks
page.
Go to VPC networks
In the Name column, click the VPC network in which
you want to create a private Cloud Data Fusion instance.
The VPC network details page opens.
Click Private service connection . If prompted, enable the
Service Networking API by clicking Enable API .
Click Allocate IP range .
Give your IP range a name.
For IP range , click Automatic .
Note: For custom ranges, Cloud Data Fusion supports valid
private IPv4 address ranges ,
including non-RFC 1918 IP ranges. It doesn't support privately
used external IP address ranges. This range allocation doesn't have
to consume IPs from any of your subnets, but it must not overlap
with any range allocations that you make in the future.
Specify a prefix size of 22 .
Note: The IP range /22 is required per Cloud Data Fusion
instance and cannot be shared by multiple instances. The IP range
belongs to Google Cloud and is where the underlying instance
components and infrastructure are hosted.
Click Allocate .
Create a private instance
Create the private Cloud Data Fusion instance in a VPC
network or a Shared VPC network.
Caution: After you create a Cloud Data Fusion instance, you cannot
change its edition.
VPC network
To create the instance in a VPC network, use either the
Google Cloud console or cURL.
If you use the Google Cloud console to create your private instance,
Cloud Data Fusion allocates the /22 IP address range by default. To
choose a different IP range, you must use the cURL command.
Console
Go to the Create Data Fusion instance page.
Go to Create Data Fusion instance
Enter an instance name and description for your instance.
Select the Region in which to create the instance.
Select a Cloud Data Fusion Version and
Edition .
Specify the
Managed Service for Apache Spark service account
to use for running your Cloud Data Fusion pipeline in
Managed Service for Apache Spark. The default Compute Engine
account is pre-selected.
Note: You must grant appropriate Identity and Access Management roles for your needs to
the service account. For more information, see
Granting service account user permission .
Expand the Advanced Options menu and click Enable Private IP .
In the Network field, choose a network in which to create the
instance.
Click Create . It takes up to 30 minutes for the instance creation
process to complete.
Note: While Cloud Data Fusion creates your instance, a progress
wheel displays next to the instance name on the Instances page.
After completion, it turns into a green check mark and indicates
that you can start using the instance.
cURL
For your convenience, you can export the following variables, or you can
directly substitute these values into the following commands:
export PROJECT = PROJECT_ID
export LOCATION = REGION
export DATA_FUSION_API_NAME = datafusion.googleapis.com
To create the instance, call its
create()
method:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://$DATA_FUSION_API_NAME/v1/projects/$PROJECT/locations/$LOCATION/instances?instance_id= INSTANCE_ID -X POST -d '{"description": "Private CDF instance created through REST.", "type": "ENTERPRISE", "privateInstance": true, "networkConfig": {"network": " NETWORK_NAME ", "ipAllocation": " IP_RANGE "}}'
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_ID : The ID string your new instance should get.
NETWORK_NAME : The name of the
VPC network where you want to create your private
instance.
IP_RANGE : The IP
range that you allocated . To find the IP range in the
Google Cloud console, go to VPC network details
> Private service connection >
Internal IP range .
Shared VPC network
To create your instance in a Shared VPC network, use cURL, not the
Google Cloud console.
cURL
For your convenience, you can export the following variables.
Alternatively, you can directly substitute these values in the following
commands:
export PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
export LOCATION= REGION
export DATA_FUSION_API_NAME=datafusion.googleapis.com
To create the instance, call its create()
method:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://$DATA_FUSION_API_NAME/v1/projects/$PROJECT/locations/$LOCATION/instances?instanceId= INSTANCE_ID -X POST -d '{"description": "Private CDF instance created through REST.", "type": "ENTERPRISE", "privateInstance": true, "networkConfig": {"network": "projects/ SHARED_VPC_HOST_PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME ", "ipAllocation": " IP_RANGE "}}'
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_ID : The ID string your new instance should get.
SHARED_VPC_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the
project that's hosting the Shared VPC network .
NETWORK_NAME : The name of the
VPC network in which you want to create the private
instance.
IP_RANGE : The IP range that you allocated .
To find the IP range in the Google Cloud console, go to the
VPC network details page >
Private service connection > Internal IP range .
Note: You cannot use an IP range allocated to another Google Cloud
service. It must be the same IP range that was allocated in the previous
step. Note: When using a Shared VPC network, the name of the
VPC network peering that is created between your project and the
tenant project is a combination of VPC network name and instance name.
The length of the VPC network peering name must not
exceed 63 characters.
Set up VPC network peering
Key Point: Your Cloud Data Fusion instance is created in its own
VPC and you might need to set up VPC network peering to
connect with the source and sink that you use in your pipeline.
Cloud Data Fusion services that you use in your
design environment
(for example: Wrangler, Connection Manager, and Schema Validation) initiate
network connections from the tenant project VPC to the source
systems. Cloud Data Fusion uses
VPC network peering to establish network
connectivity to the VPC or Shared VPC that contains your
instance. The VPC network peering lets Cloud Data Fusion access
resources in your network through internal IP addresses using your own
VPC and its controls. To connect with a resource in another
network, see the steps for connection use cases .
The following section describes how to
create a peering configuration
between your network and the Cloud Data Fusion
tenant project
network.
Get the tenant project ID
To create a peering configuration, you need the
tenant project ID.
Go to the Cloud Data Fusion Instances page.
Go to Instances
In the Instance Name column, select the instance.
On the Instance details page, copy the Tenant project ID , which is
required when you create a peering connection in the following steps.
Create a peering connection
Go to the VPC network peering page.
Go to VPC network peering
Click Create connection > Continue .
On the Create peering connection page that opens, do the following:
Enter a Name for your peering connection.
For Your VPC network , select the network that contains your
Cloud Data Fusion instance.
For Peered VPC network , select In another project .
For Project ID , enter the
tenant project ID you found previously in
this tutorial.
For VPC network name , select a network or enter
INSTANCE_REGION - INSTANCE_ID .
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_REGION : the region in which you created your
Cloud Data Fusion instance.
INSTANCE_ID : the ID of your Cloud Data Fusion instance.
Note: When the instance is created, a VPC network named
INSTANCE_REGION - INSTANCE_ID is created in the
tenant project. The private Cloud Data Fusion instance is deployed
in that VPC. This network already exists with the
configuration to peer with your customer project VPC.
Select the Internet Protocol version for the peering connection to
exchange IPv4 and IPv6 routes between your VPC network and
the peered VPC network. For more information, see
VPC network peering .
Select Export custom routes so that custom routes
can be exported from your VPC network to the tenant
VPC network.
Choose whether to allow subnet routes with public IPv4 to be imported or
exported into your VPC network.
Click Create .
The VPC network peering becomes active shortly after it is created.
Set up IAM permissions
VPC network
Skip this step and go to Create a firewall rule .
Shared VPC network
If you create your Cloud Data Fusion instance in a Shared VPC
network, you must grant the Compute Network User role
to the following service accounts. To give permissions to all subnets, grant
the role to the Shared VPC host project.
To further control access, instead grant the role to a specific subnet, and
the Network Viewer role on
the host project.
Cloud Data Fusion service account: service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-datafusion.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Managed Service for Apache Spark service account: service- PROJECT_NUMBER @dataproc-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com
PROJECT_NUMBER is the number of the
Google Cloud project that contains your Cloud Data Fusion
instance.
For more information, see Granting access
to the required service accounts.
Create a firewall rule
Create a firewall rule on your VPC network that allows for
incoming SSH connections from the IP range you specified when you created your
private Cloud Data Fusion instance.
This step is required for Cloud Data Fusion versions earlier than 6.2.0. It
allows communication between Cloud Data Fusion and Managed Service for Apache Spark
clusters running pipelines.
You can create the firewall rule by using the Google Cloud console
or by using the gcloud CLI .
Console
See Creating firewall rules .
gcloud
Run the following command:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create FIREWALL_NAME -allow-ssh --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges= IP_RANGE --network= NETWORK_NAME --project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
FIREWALL_NAME : The name of the firewall rule to
create.
IP_RANGE : The IP range you
allocated .
NETWORK_NAME : The name of the network to which
the firewall rule is attached. It's the name of the VPC
network in which you created the private instance.
PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that's
hosting the VPC network .
Steps for connection use cases
The following sections describe connection-related use cases for private
instances.
Enable Private Google Access
To access resources through internal IP addresses ,
Cloud Data Fusion must create the Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters and run
the data pipelines in a subnet that has Private Google Access. You must
enable Private Google Access for the subnet that contains the
Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters.
If only one subnet is present in the region where the Managed Service for Apache Spark
clusters are launched, then the cluster is launched in that subnet.
If there are multiple subnets in a region, you must configure
Cloud Data Fusion to select the subnet with
Private Google Access for launching Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters.
Caution: If Private Google Access isn't enabled on that subnet, the
pipeline run fails. To specify the subnet after you create an instance,
edit the compute profile.
To enable Private Google Access for the subnet, see
Private Google Access configuration .
Optional: Connect to other sources
After you create a private instance in Cloud Data Fusion, you can connect
to other sources, such as the following use cases:
On-premises databases and systems running in other VPC networks
Other Google Cloud services running in their own network in private mode, such as
Cloud SQL
Sources on the public internet
Optional: Enable DNS Peering
Enable DNS Peering in the
following cases:
When Cloud Data Fusion connects to systems through hostnames, and not IP
addresses
When the target system is deployed behind a load balancer, such as it does in
some SAP deployments
