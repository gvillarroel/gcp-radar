Access control with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes access control options in Cloud Data Fusion.
You can control access to resources in Cloud Data Fusion in the following
ways:
To control access for control plane operations, such as creating and updating
instances through the Google Cloud console,
Google Cloud CLI , and REST API , use
Identity and Access Management (IAM), as described on this page.
To grant access to Google Cloud data services, such as BigQuery or
Cloud Storage to a service account where pipelines are running, use
IAM.
To control granular permissions for actions performed in the
instance, known as
data plane
operations, such as starting pipelines, use role-based access control
( RBAC ).
Note: RBAC roles aren't typically assigned to pipeline service accounts.
For information about the architecture and resources involved in
Cloud Data Fusion access control, see
Networking .
For information about granting roles and permissions, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
About IAM in Cloud Data Fusion
You control access to Cloud Data Fusion features by granting
IAM roles and permissions to
service accounts
and other principals in your Google Cloud project.
To grant fine-grained access to user accounts so that they can use the
Cloud Data Fusion web interface, use
RBAC .
Key Point: You control access for Cloud Data Fusion at the project level .
For example, you can grant access to all Cloud Data Fusion resources within
a project to a group of developers.
By default, Cloud Data Fusion uses the following service accounts:
The Cloud Data Fusion Service Account
The Compute Engine default service account
Cloud Data Fusion Service Account
The Cloud Data Fusion Service Account is a Google-managed service agent
that can access customer resources at pipeline design time. This service agent
is automatically added to a project when you enable the
Cloud Data Fusion API. It's used for all instances in your project.
The service agent has the following responsibilities:
Communicating with other services, such as Cloud Storage,
BigQuery, or Datastream during pipeline design.
Enabling execution by provisioning Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters and
submitting pipeline jobs.
Roles for the Cloud Data Fusion Service Account
By default, the Cloud Data Fusion service account has only the
Cloud Data Fusion API Service Agent role
( roles/datafusion.serviceAgent ).
The principal name for this service agent is
service- CUSTOMER_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-datafusion.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Note: To prevent access control issues, we recommend keeping the default role
and permissions on the Cloud Data Fusion Service Account. You can add
roles based on your use case.
The following default resources are associated with the Cloud Data Fusion API
Service Agent role.
Role

Recommender API
Cloud Resource Manager API
Service Networking
Service Usage

See the Cloud Data Fusion API Service Agent
permissions .
Compute Engine default service account or custom service account
The Compute Engine service account is the default account that
Cloud Data Fusion uses to deploy and run jobs that access other
Google Cloud resources. By default, it attaches to a
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster VM to let Cloud Data Fusion access
Managed Service for Apache Spark resources during a pipeline run.
You can choose a custom service account to attach to the Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster when creating a Cloud Data Fusion instance or by creating new
Compute Profiles in the Cloud Data Fusion web interface.
For more information, see
Service accounts in Cloud Data Fusion .
Roles for the Compute Engine service account
By default, to access resources (such as sources and sinks) when you run a
pipeline, Cloud Data Fusion uses the
Compute Engine default service account .
Caution: If your instance uses the Compute Engine default service account , don't remove roles. Removing them might cause
problems with other Google Cloud services.
You can set up a user-managed custom service account for
Cloud Data Fusion instances and grant a role to this account. Afterwards,
you can choose this service account when creating new instances.
Note: If you launch Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters in a different
Google Cloud project, grant the roles in the project where Managed Service for Apache Spark is running .
By default, you grant them in the project containing the
Cloud Data Fusion instance.
Cloud Data Fusion Runner role
In the project containing the Cloud Data Fusion instance, for both default
and user-managed custom service accounts, grant the Cloud Data Fusion Runner
role ( datafusion.runner ).
Role
Description
Permission
Data Fusion Runner (datafusion.runner)
Lets the Compute Engine service account communicate with
Cloud Data Fusion services in the
tenant project
datafusion.instances.runtime
Service Account User role
On the default or user-managed service account in the project where
Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters are launched when you run pipelines, grant the
Cloud Data Fusion Service Account the Service Account User role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ).
For more information, see Grant service account permission .
Dataproc Worker role
To run the jobs on Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters, grant the Dataproc Worker
role ( roles/dataproc.worker ) to the default or user-managed service
accounts used by your Cloud Data Fusion pipelines.
Roles for users
To trigger any operation in Cloud Data Fusion, you (the principal) must
have enough permissions. Individual permissions are grouped into roles, and you
grant roles to that principal.
Note: The rest of this page describes managing permissions using
IAM for access control. To use RBAC, see
RBAC roles and permissions .
If RBAC isn't enabled, or if you're using a Cloud Data Fusion edition that
doesn't support RBAC, users with any Cloud Data Fusion IAM
role have full access to the Cloud Data Fusion web
interface. The Admin role only allows users to manage the instance, such as
Create , Update , Upgrade , and Delete operations.
Grant the following roles to principals, depending on the permissions they
need in Cloud Data Fusion.
Role
Description
Permissions
Cloud Data Fusion Admin ( roles/datafusion.admin )
All viewer permissions, plus permissions to create, update, and delete
Cloud Data Fusion instances.
datafusion.instances.get
datafusion.instances.list
datafusion.instances.create
datafusion.instances.delete
datafusion.instances.update

Access resources in another project at design time
This section describes access control on resources that are located in a
different Google Cloud project than your Cloud Data Fusion instance at design
time.
When you design pipelines in the Cloud Data Fusion web
interface, you might use functions, such as Wrangler or Preview, which
access resources in other projects.
The following sections describe how you determine the service account in your
environment and then give the appropriate permissions.
Determine the service account of your environment
The service account name is Cloud Data Fusion Service Account and the principal
for this service agent is
service- CUSTOMER_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-datafusion.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Give permission to access resources in another project
To grant the roles that give permission to access various resources, follow
these steps:
In the project where the target resource exists, add the
Cloud Data Fusion Service Account ( service- CUSTOMER_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-datafusion.iam.gserviceaccount.com ) as a principal.
Grant roles to the Cloud Data Fusion Service Account on the target
resource in the project where the target resource exists.
After you grant the roles, you can access resources in a different project at
design time in the same way that you access resources in the project where your
instance is located.
Access resources in another project at execution time
This section describes access control on resources that are located in a
different Google Cloud project than your Cloud Data Fusion instance at
execution time.
At execution time, you execute the pipeline on a Managed Service for Apache Spark
cluster, which may access resources in other projects. By default, the
Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster itself is launched in the same project as
the Cloud Data Fusion instance, but you can use clusters in another
project.
To access the resources in other Google Cloud projects, follow these
steps:
Determine the service account for your project.
In the project where the resource is, grant IAM roles
to the Compute Engine default service account to give it access to
resources in another project.
Determine the Compute Engine service account
For more information about the Compute Engine service account, see
About IAM in Cloud Data Fusion .
Grant IAM access resources in another project
The Compute Engine default service account requires permissions to
access resources in another project. These roles and permissions can be
different depending on the resource you want to access.
To access the resources, follow these steps:
Grant roles and permissions, specifying your Compute Engine service
account as a principal in the project where the target resource exists.
Add appropriate roles to access the resource.
Note: For more information, see the related
use case for
running Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters in another project. This use case has
a service account that's defined in the other project and has access
to BigQuery resources in that project. You can elaborate on the
use case for other scenarios.
