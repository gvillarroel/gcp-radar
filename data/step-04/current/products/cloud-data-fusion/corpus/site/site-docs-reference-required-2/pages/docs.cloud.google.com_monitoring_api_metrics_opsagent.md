Ops Agent metrics
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
When you install the Ops Agent on your VM instances, the agent
transmits data for the metric types listed in this document to
Monitoring. For information about choosing the right agent, see
Ops Agent overview .
Important: You must install the Ops Agent to collect the metrics
listed in this document. The Monitoring and
Logging agents collect similar metrics; see
Legacy Monitoring and Logging agent
metrics for the list of Monitoring and Logging
agent metrics and
Metrics from the Ops Agent and the
Monitoring agent for the list of differences.
For a general explanation of the entries in the tables,
including information about values like DELTA and GAUGE ,
see Metric types .
To chart or monitor metric types with values of type STRING , you
must use Monitoring Query Language (MQL), and you must convert the value into a
numeric value. For information about MQL string-conversion methods,
see String .
For information about the units used in the metric lists, see
the unit field in the MetricDescriptor reference.
For information about statements of the form
“Sampled every x seconds” and
“After sampling, data is not visible for up to y seconds”,
see Additional information: metadata .
The resource-hierarchy level tells you if the metric is written at the
project, organization, or folder level(s). When the level is not specified
in the metric descriptor, the metric writes at the project level by default.
The metric types in the table titled "agent" are free;
the other types are chargeable.
For pricing information, see Google Cloud Observability pricing .
For information about the meaning of launch stages such as
GA (General Availability) and BETA (Preview), see
Product launch stages .
Metrics from the Ops Agent and the Monitoring agent
The Monitoring agent has two entirely different implementations,
one for Linux VMs and one for Windows VMs. The Ops Agent runs on both
Linux and Windows VMs.

and the Monitoring agent.

Third-party application metrics
Starting with Ops Agent version 2.26.0,
all metrics written with the workload.googleapis.com domain have
two additional labels: instrumentation_source and
instrumentation_version . These new labels are populated with
instrumentation
scope information
that identifies the metric scheme in use.
For example, each of the workload.googleapis.com/iis.*
metrics has the following values for these labels:
For instrumentation_source ,
a value of agent.googleapis.com/iis
For instrumentation_version ,
a value of 2.0
The value of the metric
instrumentation_source label matches the value of the corresponding
logging.googleapis.com/instrumentation_source label on log
entries.
