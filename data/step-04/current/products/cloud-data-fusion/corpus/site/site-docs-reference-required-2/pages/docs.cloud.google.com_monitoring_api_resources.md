Monitored resource types
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page lists the monitored-resource types available in
Cloud Monitoring. The list of monitored-resource types in
Monitoring is not the same as the
list of monitored-resource types in Logging .
About the list
This list is regenerated frequently and time-stamped.
The fields listed for each resource type are defined in the
MonitoredResourceDescriptor object type
in the Monitoring API. For an introduction to monitored resources,
see Metrics, time series, and resources .
Cloud Endpoints : APIs managed by Cloud Endpoints write
serviceruntime metrics against the
api
monitored-resource type.
