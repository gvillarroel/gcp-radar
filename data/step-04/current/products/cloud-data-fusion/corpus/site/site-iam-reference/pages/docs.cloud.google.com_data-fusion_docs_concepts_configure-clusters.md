Dataproc cluster configuration
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In Cloud Data Fusion, cluster configuration refers to defining how your
data processing pipelines utilize computational resources when running Spark
jobs on Dataproc. This page describes the main approaches to
cluster configuration.
Default ephemeral clusters (recommended)
Using the default clusters is the recommended approach for
Cloud Data Fusion pipelines.
Cloud Data Fusion automatically provisions and manages ephemeral
Dataproc clusters for each pipeline execution. It creates a
cluster at the beginning of the pipeline run, and then deletes it after the
pipeline run completes.
Benefits of ephemeral clusters:
Simplicity : you don't need to manually configure or manage the
cluster.
Cost-effectiveness : you only pay for the resources used during
pipeline execution.
Note: Cloud Data Fusion, by default, uses Dataproc
Autoscaling compute profile which creates ephemeral clusters as per the
default configurations.
To adjust clusters and tune performance, see Cluster sizing .
Static clusters (for specific scenarios)
In the following scenarios, you can use static clusters:
Long-running pipelines : for pipelines that run continuously or for
extended periods, a static cluster can be more cost-effective than
repeatedly creating and tearing down ephemeral clusters.
Centralized cluster management : if your organization requires
centralized control over cluster creation and management policies, static
clusters can be used alongside tools like Terraform.
Cluster creation time : when the time it takes to create a new cluster
for every pipeline is prohibitive for your use case.
However, static clusters require more manual configuration and involve managing
the cluster lifecycle yourself.
To use a static cluster, you must set the following
properties
on the Dataproc cluster:
dataproc : dataproc . conscrypt . provider . enable = false
capacity - scheduler : yarn . scheduler . capacity . resource - calculator = "org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.resource.DefaultResourceCalculator"
Cluster configuration options for static clusters
If you choose to use static clusters, Cloud Data Fusion offers
configuration options for the following aspects:
Worker machine type : specify the virtual machine type for the worker
nodes in your cluster. This determines the vCPUs and memory available for
each worker.
Number of workers : define the initial number of worker nodes in your
cluster. Dataproc might still autoscale this number, based on
workload.
Zone : select your cluster's Google Cloud zone. Location can affect
data locality and network performance.
Additional configurations : you can configure advanced options for your
static cluster, such as preemption settings, network settings, and
initialization actions.
Best practices
When creating a static cluster for your pipelines, use the following
configurations.
Parameters
Description
yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec
Retains YARN logs.
Recommended value: 86400 (equivalent to one day)
yarn.nodemanager.pmem-check-enabled
Enables YARN to check for physical memory limits and kill containers if
they go beyond physical memory.
Recommended value: false
yarn.nodemanager.vmem-check-enabled
Enables YARN to check for virtual memory limits and kill containers if
they go beyond physical memory.
Recommended value: false
dataproc.scheduler.driver-size-mb
The average memory footprint of the driver makes Dataproc queue the job if the master node lacks sufficient memory to run the driver process. This can impact job concurrency but can be mitigated by using a master node with more memory.
Recommended value: 2048
For more information, see Run a pipeline against an existing Dataproc cluster .
Reusing clusters
You can reuse Dataproc clusters between runs to improve
processing time. Cluster reuse is implemented in a model similar to connection
pooling or thread pooling. Any cluster is kept up and running for a specified
time after the run is finished. When a new run is started, it will try to find
an idle cluster available that matches the configuration of the compute profile.
If one is present, it will be used, otherwise a new cluster will be started.
Considerations for reusing clusters
Clusters are not shared. Similar to the regular ephemeral cluster
provisioning model, a cluster runs a single pipeline run at a time. A
cluster is reused only if it is idle .
If you enable cluster reuse for all your runs, the necessary number of
clusters to process all your runs will be created as needed. Similar to the
ephemeral Dataproc provisioner, there is no direct control on
the number of clusters created. You can still use Google Cloud quotes
to manage resources. For example, if you run 100 runs with 7 maximum
parallel runs, you will have up to 7 clusters at a given point of time.
Clusters are reused between different pipelines as soon as those pipelines
are using the same profile and share the same profile settings. If profile
customization is used, clusters will still be reused, but only if
customizations are exactly the same, including all cluster settings like
cluster labeling.
When cluster reuse is enabled, there are two main cost considerations:
Less resources are used for cluster startup and initialization.
More resources are used for clusters to sit idle between the pipeline
runs and after the last pipeline run.
While it's hard to predict the cost effect of cluster reuse, you can employ a
strategy to get maximum savings. The strategy is to identify a critical path for
chained pipelines and enable cluster reuse for this critical path. This would
ensure the cluster is immediately reused, no idle time is wasted and maximum
performance benefits are achieved.
Enable Cluster Reuse
In the Compute Config section of deployed pipeline configuration or when
creating new compute profile:
Enable Skip Cluster Delete .
Max Idle Time is the time up to which a cluster waits for the next pipeline
to reuse it. The default Max Idle Time is 30 minutes. For Max Idle Time,
consider the cost versus cluster availability for reuse. The higher the
value of Max Idle Time, the more clusters sit idle, ready for a run.
Troubleshoot: Version compatibility
Problem : The version of your Cloud Data Fusion environment might
not be compatible with the version of your Dataproc cluster.
Recommended : Upgrade to the latest Cloud Data Fusion version and
use one of the supported Dataproc versions .
Earlier versions of Cloud Data Fusion are only compatible with
unsupported versions of Dataproc .
Dataproc does not provide updates and support for clusters
created with these versions. Although you can continue running a cluster that
was created with an unsupported version, we recommend replacing it with one
created with a
supported version .
Cloud Data Fusion version
Dataproc version
6.11.1
2.3, 2.2 *** , 2.1
6.10.1.1
2.2 *** , 2.1, 2.0 *
6.10
2.1, 2.0 *

2.0, 1.5 *
6.4-6.6
2.0 * , 1.3 **
6.1-6.3
1.3 **
* Cloud Data Fusion versions 6.4 and later
are compatible with
supported versions of Dataproc . Unless specific OS features
are needed, the recommended practice is to specify the
major.minor image version .
To specify the OS version used in your Dataproc cluster, the OS
version must be compatible with one of the supported Dataproc
versions for your Cloud Data Fusion in the preceding table.
** Cloud Data Fusion versions 6.1 to 6.6 are
compatible with
unsupported Dataproc version 1.3 .
*** Certain
issues are detected with this image version. This Dataproc
image version is not recommended for production use.
Troubleshoot: Container exited with a non-zero exit code 3
Problem : An autoscaling policy isn't used, and the static
Dataproc clusters are encountering memory pressure, causing an
out of memory exception to appear in the logs: Container exited with a non-zero
exit code 3 .
Recommended : Increase the executor memory.
Increase the memory by adding a task.executor.system.resources.memory runtime
argument to the pipeline. The following example runtime argument sets the memory
to 4096 MB:
"task.executor.system.resources.memory": 4096
