Cluster sizing
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud Data Fusion by default used Autoscale as the compute profile.
Estimating the best number of cluster workers (nodes) for a workload is
difficult, and a single cluster size for an entire pipeline is often not ideal.
The Managed Service for Apache Spark Autoscaling provides a mechanism for automating
cluster resource management and enables cluster worker VM autoscaling. For more
information, see Autoscaling
On the Compute config page, where you can see a list of profiles, there is a
Total cores column, which has the maximum v CPUs that the profile can
scale up to, such as Up to 84 .
If you want to use the Managed Service for Apache Spark Compute profile , you can manage
cluster sizes based on the pipeline size.
Master node
Master nodes use resources proportional to the number of pipelines or additional
applications that are running on the cluster. If you're running pipelines on
ephemeral clusters, use 2 CPUs and 8 GB of memory for the master
nodes. If you're using persistent clusters, you might need larger master nodes
to keep up with the workflow. To understand if you need larger master nodes, you
can monitor memory and CPU usage on the node. We recommend sizing your
worker nodes with at least 2 CPUs and 8 GB of memory. If you've
configured your pipelines to use larger amounts of memory, then you must use
larger workers.
To minimize execution time, ensure that your cluster has enough nodes to allow
for as much parallel processing as possible.
Workers
The following sections describe aspects of sizing worker nodes.
CPU and Memory
We recommend sizing your worker nodes with at least 2 CPU and 8 GB
memory. If you configured your pipelines to use larger amounts of memory, use
larger workers. For example, with a 4 CPU 15 GB worker node, each
worker will have 4 CPU and 12 GB available to run YARN containers. If
your pipeline is configured to run 1 CPU, 8 GB executors, YARN is
unable to run more than one container per worker node. Each worker node would
have an extra 3 CPU and 4 GB that's wasted because it can't be used to
run anything. To maximize resource utilization on your cluster, you will want
the YARN memory and CPUs to be an exact multiple of the amount needed per
Spark executor. You can check how much memory each worker has reserved for YARN
by checking the yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb property in YARN.
If you're using Managed Service for Apache Spark, the memory available for YARN
containers will be roughly 75% of the VM memory. The minimum YARN container size
is also adjusted depending on the size of the worker VMs. Some common worker
sizes and their corresponding YARN settings are given in the following table.

Keep in mind that Spark requests for more memory than the executor memory
set for the pipeline, and that YARN rounds that requested amount up. For
example, suppose you have set your executor memory to 2048 MB, and have not
given a value for spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead , which means the default
of 384 MB is used. That means Spark requests 2048 MB + 384 MB
for each executor, which YARN rounds up to an exact multiple of the YARN
minimum allocation. When running on a 8 GB worker node, because the YARN
minimum allocation is 512 MB, it gets rounded up to 2.5 GB. This
means each worker can run two containers, using up all
available CPUs, but leaving 1 GB of YARN memory (6 GB -
2.5 GB - 2.5 GB) unused. This means the worker node can actually be
sized a little smaller, or the executors can be given a little bit more memory.
When running on a 16 GB worker node, 2048 MB + 1024 MB is
rounded up to 3 GB because the YARN minimum allocation is 1024 MB.
This means each worker node is able to run four containers, with all CPUs
and YARN memory in use.
To help give context, the following table shows recommended worker sizes given
some common executor sizes.

For example, a 26 GB worker node translates to 20 GB of memory usable
for running YARN containers. With executor memory set to 4 GB, 1 GB is
added as overhead, which means 5 GB YARN containers for each executor. This
means the worker can run four containers without any extra resources leftover.
You can also multiply the size of the workers. For example, if executor memory
is set to 4096 GB, a worker with 8 CPUs and 52 GB memory would
also work well. Compute Engine VMs restrict how much memory the VM can have based
on the number of cores. For example, a VM with 4 cores must have at least
7.25 GB of memory and at most 26 GB of memory. This means an executor
set to use 1 CPU and 8 GB of memory uses 2 CPUs and 26 GB
of memory on the VM. If executors are instead configured to use 2 CPUs and
8 GB of memory, all of the CPUs are utilized.
Disk
Disk is important for some pipelines but not all of them. If your pipeline does
not contain any shuffles, disk will only be used when Spark runs out of memory
and needs to spill data to disk. For these types of pipelines, disk size and
type are generally not going to make a big impact on your performance. If your
pipeline is shuffling a lot of data, disk performance will make a difference. If
you are using Managed Service for Apache Spark, it is recommended that you use disk sizes
of at least 1tb, as disk performance scales up with disk size. For information
about disk performance, see Configure disks to meet performance
requirements .
Number of workers
In order to minimize execution time, you will want to ensure that your cluster
is large enough that it can run as much as it can in parallel. For example, if
your pipeline source reads data using 100 splits, you will want to make sure the
cluster is large enough to run 100 executors at once.
The easiest way to tell if your cluster is undersized is by looking at the YARN
pending memory over time. If you are using Managed Service for Apache Spark, a graph can
be found on the cluster detail page.
If pending memory is high for long periods
of time, you can increase the number of workers to add that much extra capacity
to your cluster. In the preceding example, the cluster should be increased by
around 28 GB to ensure that the maximum level of parallelism is achieved.
Enhanced Flexibility Mode (EFM)
EFM lets you specify that only primary worker nodes be involved when shuffling
data. Since secondary workers are no longer responsible for intermediate shuffle
data, when they are removed from a cluster, Spark jobs don't run into delays or
errors. Since primary workers are never scaled down, the cluster scales down
with more stability and efficiency. If you're running pipelines with shuffles on
a static cluster, it is recommended that you use EFM.
For more information on EFM, see Managed Service for Apache Spark enhanced flexibility mode .
