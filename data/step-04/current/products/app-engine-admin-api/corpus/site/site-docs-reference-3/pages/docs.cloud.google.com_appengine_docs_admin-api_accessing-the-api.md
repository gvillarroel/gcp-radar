Accessing the Admin API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Before users or applications can use the App Engine Admin API, you as a
Google Cloud project owner must first enable the API in your project and
then create credentials that users or applications can use to authorize HTTP
requests.
For example, an owner must first create an initial Google Cloud
project and then create credentials in that project before anyone can send HTTP
requests to the Admin API. After the owner sets up and configures
the initial project, that project can then be used for administrative purposes
to programmatically create and manage other resources, for example:
Creating other Google Cloud projects.
Creating App Engine applications for all newly created projects.
Deploying app versions to newly created App Engine applications.
Managing resources in all of the versions that you deployed.
Before you begin
To complete the following task, you must be an owner of the
Google Cloud project where you want to enable the
Admin API for users and applications to access.
Tip: You can use both the OAuth 2.0 Playground and
APIs Explorer to try out the
Admin API before you start configuring your project.
Configuring your project and creating credentials
To configure your Google Cloud project and create credentials:
Enable both the App Engine Admin API and Cloud Storage API in your
Google Cloud project:
Enable both APIs
Create credentials that users and applications use to access the
Admin API in your project.
To create credentials, review the Google Cloud Platform Auth
Guide and then choose the OAuth
2.0 authorization flow that meets your app's requirements.
Important: This API requires that you request access to one of the following
OAuth 2.0 scopes in your code:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/appengine.admin
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only
The Authorization section on each method's reference page describes
which OAuth scopes are required. Also see the list of methods, permissions,
and related roles in Controlling
Access to
help you determine which OAuth scope is adequate for your needs.
Examples
To demonstrate an authentication flow, the examples below use the client-side
OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain a token. The token is used to authorize requests to the
Admin API using the cURL command-line tool to deploy the example
app to the App Engine application of the project [MY_PROJECT_ID] .
Authentication example
In this example, the client-side authorization flow known as the implicit grant
flow , requires the user to authorize the client application for access to the
Admin API on behalf of the user. The access token that is returned is
valid for approximately 60 minutes or generally while the user is active on your
application.
Tip: For more information about the implicit grant flow and how the URL below is
formed, see
using OAuth 2.0 for client-side web
applications .
HTTP request
The following URL uses a client ID that was created in the Google Cloud console to
request an access token and then redirect the user to an authorized URI where
your app receives the token:
https : // accounts . google . com / o / oauth2 / v2 / auth ?
response_type = token &
client_id =[ MY_CLIENT_ID ] . apps . googleusercontent . com &
scope = https : // www . googleapis . com / auth / cloud - platform &
redirect_uri =[ MY_REDIRECT_URI ]
Where:
[MY_CLIENT_ID] is a Client ID from one of your credentials in the
Google Cloud console .
[MY_REDIRECT_URI] is the corresponding Authorized redirect URIs from the
same credential in the Google Cloud console .
If no redirect URI is specified, you must specify a trusted URI, for example
https://www.google.com . The redirect URI defines where the HTTP response is
sent. For production, you must specify your application's auth endpoint, which
handles responses from the OAuth 2.0 server. For more information, see Using
OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications .
HTTP response
When the application uses the URL to request authorization, the access token
is returned in a response, for example:
https : // www . google . com / #access_token =[ MY_ACCESS_TOKEN ] &
token_type = Bearer &
expires_in = 3600
Where [MY_ACCESS_TOKEN] is the returned access token that you requested.
After you obtain an access token, you can use it to access the
Admin API. For example, your application's auth endpoint can
programmatically extract the access token from the response. See the following
example for how to manually use your token in a cURL command.
HTTP request example using cURL
The following cURL command demonstrates how you can use your [MY_ACCESS_TOKEN]
access token to make an HTTP POST request. This cURL command deploys
the resources defined in the app.json configuration file to the v1 version
of the default service in the application of project MY_PROJECT_ID .
curl - X POST - T "app.json" - H "Content-Type: application/json" - H "Authorization: Bearer [MY_ACCESS_TOKEN]" https : // appengine . googleapis . com / v1 / apps /[ MY_PROJECT_ID ]/ services / default / versions
