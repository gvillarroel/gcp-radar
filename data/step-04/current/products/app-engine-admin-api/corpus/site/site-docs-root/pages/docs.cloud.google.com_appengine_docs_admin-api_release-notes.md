Feature
App Engine is now available in the us-west3 region (Salt Lake City, Utah).
February 11, 2020
Change
App Engine is changing the URLs that you use to send requests to your apps. URLs now include a region ID to help Google route your requests more efficiently and reliably. For example, an app can receive requests at https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com . This new URL is optional for existing apps and is provided for all new apps.
To ensure a smooth transition, we are slowly updating App Engine to use region IDs. If we haven't updated your Google Cloud project yet, you won't see a region ID for your app. Since the ID is optional for existing apps, you don't need to update URLs or make other changes once the region ID is available for your existing apps.
February 06, 2020

May 17, 2018
Fixed
Minor bug fixes.
May 15, 2018
Change
No more resident instances in auto scaling. Previously, if you used the min_idle_instances setting, the minimum idle instances were labelled as Resident in the Cloud Console, with the remainder of the instances labelled as Dynamic . The new scheduler simply labels all instances as Dynamic with auto scaling. However, the underlying behavior remains similar to previous behavior. If you use min_idle_instances and enable warmup requests, you will see at least that many dynamic instances running even during periods with no traffic.
For more details, see the auto scaling documentation .
Feature
New target CPU utilization setting lets you optimize between latency and cost.
Feature
New max instances setting allows you to cap the total number of instances to be scheduled.
Feature
New target throughput utilization setting lets you optimize for the number of concurrent requests at which new instances are started.
Feature
Completed a gradual rollout of an upgrade to the automatic scaling system:
Feature
New min instances setting allows you to specify a minimum number of instance to keep running for your app.
Feature
Improved efficiency resulting generally in lower instance cost (up to 6% reduction for many users) and up to 30% reduction for loading requests , which are the first request to a new instance.

December 05, 2017
Feature
For all incoming HTTP requests, dev_appserver.py now requires that all HTTP requests must have an HTTP Host header and its value is either localhost , an IPv4 or IPv6 loopback address, or if specified, the value passed in via --host . For HTTP/1.0 only, requests with no Host header are still allowed. To disable host checking, set the --enable_host_checking flag to false . However, it is strongly recommended to leave host checking enabled, as it guards against DNS rebinding attacks.
Feature
Introduced additional security-header related behavior to the dev_appserver.py admin console:
* Inbound requests containing an Origin header are rejected.
* Added the following headers to all responses:
* X-Frame-Options=SAMEORIGIN
* X-XSS-Protection=1; mode=block
* Content-Security-Policy=default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'

Change
If you have an existing domain mapping and SSL certificate, then it continues to function as expected. You can also upgrade to managed SSL certificates .
Feature
You can now use managed certificates to add SSL to your custom domain. Once you map your custom domain to your application, App Engine provisions an SSL certificate automatically and handles renewing the certificate before it expires and revoking it if you remove the custom domain. Managed certificates are in beta. For more information, see Securing Custom Domains with SSL .
Feature
The gcloud commands and Admin API methods used to map custom domains are now generally available. This includes gcloud domains verify and apps.authorizedDomains.list .

Cloud Datastore
When committing a cross-group transaction, version numbers returned for new or updated entities are all the same. With the previous behavior, entities within the same group committed as part of a cross-group transaction, had the same version number, but entities in different groups might have had different version numbers. This change ensures all new and updated entities have an identical version number, regardless of their entity group, when committed as part of a cross-group transaction. As before, entities that are not updated will not have a new version number.

Version 1.9.32
Feature
Container construction choices for Managed VMs
The gcloud preview app deploy (and mvn gcloud:deploy ) commands upload your artifacts to our servers and build a container to deploy your app to the Managed VM environment.
There are two mechanisms for building the container image remotely. The default behavior is to build the container on a transient Compute Engine Virtual Machine which has Docker installed. Alternatively, you can use the Cloud Build service. To use the Cloud Build service, follow these steps:
1. Activate the Cloud Build API for your project.
2. Use the command gcloud config set app/use_cloud_build True . This will cause all invocations of gcloud preview app deploy to use the service. (To return to the default behavior, use the command gcloud config set app/use_cloud_build False .
January 14, 2016
Feature
App Engine now supports Google Groups: Adding a Google Group as a member of a project grants the members of the group access to App Engine. For example, if a Google Group is an Editor on a project, all members of the group now have Editor access to the App Engine application.
