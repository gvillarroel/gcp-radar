Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: Cloud Deployment Manager reaches end of
support on March 31, 2026. For more information, see
Cloud Deployment Manager deprecation .
To automate the deployment of an SAP HANA scale-up system in a high-availability
cluster on Google Cloud, we recommend that you use Terraform. For more
information, see
Terraform: SAP HANA
scale-up high-availability cluster configuration guide .
This guide shows you how to automate the deployment of SAP HANA in a Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
high-availability (HA) cluster that uses an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer to manage the
virtual IP (VIP) address.
The guide uses Cloud Deployment Manager
to deploy two Compute Engine
virtual machines (VMs), two SAP HANA scale up systems, a virtual IP address
(VIP) with an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer implementation, and an OS-based HA cluster, all
according to the best practices from Google Cloud, SAP, and the OS vendor.
One of the SAP HANA systems functions as the primary, active system and the
other functions as a secondary, standby system. You deploy both SAP HANA
systems within the same region, ideally in different zones.
The deployed cluster includes the following functions and features:
The Pacemaker high-availability cluster resource manager.
A Google Cloud fencing mechanism.
A virtual IP (VIP) that uses a level 4 TCP internal load balancer
implementation, including:
A reservation of the IP address that you select for the VIP
Two Compute Engine instance groups
A TCP internal load balancer
A Compute Engine health check
In RHEL HA clusters:
The Red Hat high-availability pattern
The Red Hat resource agent and fencing packages
In SLES HA clusters:
The SUSE high-availability pattern.
The SUSE SAPHanaSR resource agent package.
Synchronous system replication.
Memory preload.
Automatic restart of the failed instance as the new secondary instance.
To deploy an SAP HANA system without a Linux high-availability cluster or standby
hosts, use the SAP HANA Deployment Guide .
This guide is intended for advanced SAP HANA users who are familiar with
Linux high-availability configurations for SAP HANA.
Prerequisites
Before you create the SAP HANA high availability cluster, make sure that the
following prerequisites are met:
You have read the
SAP HANA planning guide and the
SAP HANA high-availability planning guide .
You or your organization has a Google Cloud account and you have created
a project for the SAP HANA deployment. For information about creating
Google Cloud accounts and projects, see
Setting up your Google account
in the SAP HANA Deployment Guide.
If you require your SAP workload to run in compliance with data residency, access control, support
personnel, or regulatory requirements, then you must create the required
Assured Workloads folder. For more information,
see Compliance and sovereign controls
for SAP on Google Cloud .
The SAP HANA installation media is stored in a Cloud Storage bucket that is
available in your deployment project and region. For information about how to
upload SAP HANA installation media to a Cloud Storage bucket, see
Downloading SAP HANA in the
SAP HANA Deployment Guide.
If OS login
is enabled in your project metadata, you need to disable
OS login temporarily until your deployment is complete. For deployment
purposes, this procedure configures SSH keys in instance metadata.
When OS login is enabled, metadata-based SSH key configurations are
disabled, and this deployment
fails.
After deployment is complete, you can enable OS login again.
For more information, see:
Enabling or disabling OS Login
Add SSH keys to VMs that use metadata-based SSH keys
If you are using VPC internal DNS ,
the value of the vmDnsSetting variable
in your project metadata must be either GlobalOnly or ZonalPreferred
to enable the resolution of the node names across zones.
The default setting of vmDnsSetting is ZonalOnly . For more information,
see:
Configuring DNS names for your project or instances
Querying custom metadata
Setting project-wide custom metadata
To avoid unintentionally exposing your VM instance to the internet,
follow these recommendations:
Use a NAT gateway.
Create firewall rules
that block all external access that you don't require.
When you create your VMs:
Specify a network tag for each VM for use in routing and firewall
rules. If you use the Deployment Manager
template that Google Cloud provides, specify a tag with
networkTag: [TAG] .
Create the VMs without an external IP. If you use the
Deployment Manager templates that Google Cloud
provides, specify publicIP: No .
Creating a network
For security purposes, create a new network. You can control who has access by
adding firewall rules or by using another access control method.
If your project has a default VPC network, then don't use it.
Instead, create your own VPC network so that the only firewall rules
in effect are those that you create explicitly.
During deployment, Compute Engine instances typically require access to the internet to
download Google Cloud's Agent for SAP. If you are using one of the SAP-certified Linux
images that are available from Google Cloud, then the compute instance also requires access
to the internet in order to register the license and to access OS vendor repositories.
A configuration with a NAT gateway and with VM network tags supports this access, even if the
target compute instances don't have external IPs.
To set up networking:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks page.
Go to VPC networks
Click Create VPC network .
Enter a Name for the network.
The name must adhere to the
naming convention .
VPC networks use the Compute Engine naming convention.
For Subnet creation mode , choose Custom .
In the New subnet section, specify the following configuration parameters for a
subnet:
Enter a Name for the subnet.
For Region , select the
Compute Engine region where
you want to create the subnet.
For IP stack type , select IPv4 (single-stack) and then enter an IP
address range in the
CIDR format ,
such as 10.1.0.0/24 .
This is the primary
IPv4 range for the subnet. If you plan to add more than one subnet, then
assign non-overlapping CIDR IP ranges for each subnetwork in the network.
Note that each subnetwork and its internal IP ranges are mapped to a single
region.
Click Done .
To add more subnets, click Add subnet and repeat the preceding steps. You can add
more subnets to the network after you have created the network.
Click Create .
gcloud
Go to Cloud Shell.
Go to Cloud Shell
To create a new network in the custom subnetworks mode, run:
gcloud compute networks create NETWORK_NAME --subnet-mode custom
Replace NETWORK_NAME with the name of the new network. The
name must adhere to the
naming convention .
VPC networks use the Compute Engine naming convention.
Specify --subnet-mode custom to avoid using the default auto mode, which
automatically creates a subnet in each Compute Engine region. For more
information, see Subnet creation mode .
Create a subnetwork, and specify the region and IP range:
gcloud compute networks subnets create SUBNETWORK_NAME \
--network NETWORK_NAME --region REGION --range RANGE
Replace the following:
SUBNETWORK_NAME : the name of the new subnetwork
NETWORK_NAME : the name of the network you created in the
previous step
REGION : the
region where you want the subnetwork
RANGE : the IP address range,
specified in CIDR format ,
such as 10.1.0.0/24
If you plan to add more than one subnetwork, assign
non-overlapping CIDR IP ranges for each subnetwork in the network. Note that
each subnetwork and its internal IP ranges are mapped to a single region.
Optionally, repeat the previous step and add additional subnetworks.
Setting up a NAT gateway
If you need to create one or more VMs without public IP addresses, then you need to use network
address translation (NAT) to enable the VMs to access the internet. Use Cloud NAT, a
Google Cloud distributed, software-defined managed service that lets VMs send outbound
packets to the internet and receive any corresponding established inbound response packets.
Alternatively, you can set up a separate VM as a NAT gateway.
Key Point: When you configure Cloud NAT, specify at least
160 as the minimum number of ports per VM. Certain operating system updates run concurrent
processes that might exceed the Cloud NAT default for the number of ports, which can
result in activation or download errors.
When you create a Cloud NAT instance, specify the number of ports in the Minimum
ports per VM field under Advanced configurations on the Create a NAT gateway page in the
Google Cloud console.
To create a Cloud NAT instance for your project, see
Using Cloud NAT .
After you configure Cloud NAT for your project, your VM instances can
securely access the internet without a public IP address.
Adding firewall rules
By default, an implied firewall rule blocks incoming connections from outside
your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. To allow incoming connections,
set up a firewall rule for your VM. After an incoming connection is established
with a VM, traffic is permitted in both directions over that connection.
HA clusters for SAP HANA require at least two firewall rules, one that
allows the Compute Engine health check to check the health of
the cluster nodes and another that allows the cluster nodes to communicate
with each other.
If you are not using a shared VPC network, you need to create the firewall
rule for the communication between the nodes, but not for the health checks.
The
Deployment Manager template creates the firewall rule
for the health checks, which you can modify after deployment is complete,
if needed.
If you are using a shared VPC network, a network
administrator needs to create both firewall rules in the host project.
You can also create a firewall rule to allow external access to specified ports,
or to restrict access between VMs on the same network. If the default
VPC network type is used, some additional default rules also
apply, such as the default-allow-internal rule, which allows connectivity
between VMs on the same network on all ports.
Depending on the IT policy that is applicable to your environment, you might
need to isolate or otherwise restrict connectivity to your database host, which
you can do by creating firewall rules.
Depending on your scenario, you can create firewall rules to allow access
for:
The default SAP ports that are listed in TCP/IP of All SAP Products .
Connections from your computer or your corporate network environment to your
Compute Engine instance. If you are unsure of what IP address to use, talk
to your company's network administrator.
SSH connections to your VM instance, including SSH-in-browser .
Connection to your VM by using a third-party tool in Linux. Create a rule to
allow access for the tool through your firewall.
Note: The following procedure is a simplified version of the instructions for
creating firewall rules. For more detailed instructions, see
Creating firewall rules .
To create a firewall rule:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC network Firewall page.
Go to Firewall
At the top of the page, click Create firewall rule .
In the Network field, select the network where your VM is
located.
In the Targets field, specify the resources on Google Cloud
that this rule applies to. For example, specify
All instances in the network . Or to to limit
the rule to specific instances on Google Cloud,
enter tags in Specified target tags .
In the Source filter field, select one of the following:
IP ranges to allow incoming traffic from specific IP addresses.
Specify the range of IP addresses in the Source IP
ranges field.
Subnets to allow incoming traffic from a particular
subnetwork. Specify the subnetwork name in the following
Subnets field. You can use this option to allow access between
the VMs in a 3-tier or scaleout configuration.
In the Protocols and ports section, select Specified protocols and
ports and enter tcp: PORT_NUMBER .
Click Create to create your firewall rule.
gcloud
Create a firewall rule by using the following command:
$ gcloud compute firewall-rules create FIREWALL_NAME
--direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 \
--network= NETWORK_NAME --action=ALLOW --rules= PROTOCOL : PORT \
--source-ranges IP_RANGE --target-tags= NETWORK_TAGS
Creating a high-availability Linux cluster with SAP HANA installed
The following instructions use the Cloud Deployment Manager to create a
RHEL or SLES cluster with two SAP HANA systems: a primary single-host
SAP HANA system on one VM instance and a standby SAP HANA system on another
VM instance in the same Compute Engine region. The SAP HANA systems
use synchronous system replication and the standby system preloads the
replicated data.
You define configuration options for the SAP HANA high-availability cluster in a
Deployment Manager configuration file template.
The following instructions use the Cloud Shell, but are generally applicable
to the Google Cloud CLI.
Confirm that your current quotas for resources such as persistent disks and
CPUs are sufficient for the SAP HANA systems you are about to install. If
your quotas are insufficient, deployment fails. For the SAP HANA quota
requirements, see Pricing and quota considerations for SAP HANA .
Go to the quotas page
Open the Cloud Shell or, if you installed the Google Cloud CLI on your
local workstation, open a terminal.
Go to the Cloud Shell
Download the template.yaml configuration file template for the SAP HANA
high-availability cluster to your working directory by entering the following
command in the Cloud Shell or gcloud CLI:
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudsapdeploy/deploymentmanager/latest/dm-templates/sap_hana_ha_ilb/template.yaml
Optionally, rename the template.yaml file to identify the configuration it
defines.
Open the template.yaml file in the Cloud Shell code editor or, if
you are using the gcloud CLI, the text editor of your choice.
To open the Cloud Shell code editor, click the pencil icon in the
upper right corner of the Cloud Shell terminal window.
In the template.yaml file, update the property values by replacing the
brackets and their contents with the values for your installation. The
properties are described in the following table.
To create the VM instances without installing SAP HANA, delete or comment
out all of the lines that begin with sap_hana_ .

String
Optional but recommended if available for the target machine and OS version. Specifies the network interface to use with the VM instance. You can specify the
value GVNIC or VIRTIO_NET . To use a
Google Virtual NIC (gVNIC), you need to
specify an OS image that supports gVNIC as the value for the linuxImage property.
For the OS image list, see Operating system details .
If you do not specify a value for this property, then the network interface is
automatically selected based on the machine type that you specify for the
instanceType property.
This argument is available in Deployment Manager template versions
202302060649 or later.
The following examples show completed configuration file template that
defines a high-availability cluster for SAP HANA. The cluster uses an
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer to manage the VIP.
Deployment Manager deploys the Google Cloud
resources that are defined in the configuration file and then scripts
take over to configure the operating system, install SAP HANA, configure
replication, and configure the Linux HA cluster.
Click RHEL or SLES to see the example that is specific to your

Create the instances:
$ gcloud deployment-manager deployments create deployment-name --config template-name .yaml
The above command invokes the Deployment Manager, which
sets up the Google Cloud infrastructure and then hands control
over to a script that installs and configures SAP HANA and the HA cluster.
While Deployment Manager has control, status messages are
written to the Cloud Shell. After the scripts are invoked,
status messages are written to Logging and are viewable
in the Google Cloud console, as described in
Check the logs .
Time to completion can vary, but the entire process
usually takes less than 30 minutes.
Verifying the deployment of your HANA HA system
Verifying an SAP HANA HA cluster involves several different procedures:
Checking Logging
Checking the configuration of the VM and the SAP HANA installation
Checking the cluster configuration
Checking the load balancer and the health of the instance groups
Checking the SAP HANA system using SAP HANA Studio
Performing a failover test
Check the logs
In the Google Cloud console, open Cloud Logging to monitor installation
progress and check for errors.
Note: You might incur costs when completing this step in Cloud Logging.
For more information, see
Cloud Logging pricing .
Go to Cloud Logging
Filter the logs:
Logs Explorer
In the Logs Explorer page, go to the Query pane.
From the Resource drop-down menu, select Global , and then click
Add .
If you don't see the Global option, then in the query editor, enter
the following query:
resource . type = "global"
"Deployment"
Click Run query .
Legacy Logs Viewer
In the Legacy Logs Viewer page, from the basic selector menu, select
Global as your logging resource.
Analyze the filtered logs:
If "--- Finished" is displayed, then the
deployment processing is complete and you can
proceed to the next step.
If you see a quota error:
On the IAM & Admin
Quotas
page, increase any of your quotas that do not meet the
SAP HANA requirements that are listed in the
SAP HANA planning guide .
On the Deployment Manager
Deployments
page, delete the deployment to clean up the VMs and persistent
disks from the failed installation.
Rerun your deployment.
Check the configuration of the VM and the SAP HANA installation
After the SAP HANA system deploys without errors, connect to each VM by
using SSH. From the Compute Engine VM instances page ,
you can click the SSH button for each VM instance, or you can use your
preferred SSH method.
Change to the root user.

Check the load balancer and the health of the instance groups
To confirm that the load balancer and health check were set up correctly,
check the load balancer and instance groups in the Google Cloud console.
Open the Load balancing page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to Cloud Load Balancing
In the list of load balancers, confirm that a load balancer was
created for your HA cluster.
Note: You can disregard the warning, "1 backend service is unhealthy". In
an HA cluster, the load balancer only registers the active node as healthy.
On the Load balancer details page in the Healthy column under
Instance group in the Backend section, confirm that one of the
instance groups shows "1/1" and the other shows "0/1". After a failover,
the healthy indicator, "1/1", switches to the new active instance group.
Check the SAP HANA system using SAP HANA Studio
You can use either SAP HANA Cockpit or SAP HANA Studio to monitor and
manage your SAP HANA systems in a high-availability cluster.
Note: If your instance of SAP HANA Cockpit or SAP HANA Studio is in a
different Google Cloud region that the SAP HANA system, you need
to modify the forwarding rule of the load balancer to allow access
from outside of the region of the SAP HANA system.
To enable access to the SAP HANA system from other regions,
see Enabling global access .
Connect to the HANA system by using SAP HANA Studio. When defining the
connection, specify the following values:
On the Specify System panel, specify the floating IP address as the
Host Name.
On the Connection Properties panel, for database user authentication,
specify the database superuser name and the password that you specified
for the sap_hana_system_password property in the template.yaml file.
For information from SAP about installing SAP HANA Studio, see
SAP HANA Studio Installation and Update Guide .
After SAP HANA Studio is connected to your HANA HA system, display the
system overview by double-clicking the system name in the navigation pane on
the left side of the window.
Under General Information on the Overview tab, confirm that:
The Operational Status shows "All services started".
The System Replication Status shows "All services are active and in sync".
Confirm the replication mode by clicking the System Replication Status
link under General Information. Synchronous replication is indicated by
SYNCMEM in the REPLICATION_MODE column on the System Replication tab.
If any of the validation steps show that the installation failed:
Resolve the errors.
Delete the deployment from the Deployments
page.
Recreate the instances, as described in the last step of
the previous section .
Perform a failover test
To perform a failover test:
Connect to the primary VM by using SSH. You can connect from the
Compute Engine VM instances page
by clicking the SSH button for each VM instance, or you can use your
preferred SSH method.
At the command prompt, enter the following command:
sudo ip link set eth0 down
The ip link set eth0 down command triggers a failover by severing
communications with the primary host.
Reconnect to either host using SSH and change to the root user.
Confirm that the primary host is now active on the VM
that used to contain the secondary host. Automatic restart is enabled in the
cluster, so the stopped host will restart and assume the role of secondary
host.

Validate your installation of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP
After you have deployed a VM and installed your SAP system, validate that
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is functioning properly.
Verify that Google Cloud's Agent for SAP is running
To verify that the agent is running, follow these steps:
Establish an SSH connection with your
Compute Engine instance.
Run the following command:
systemctl status google-cloud-sap-agent
If the agent is functioning properly, then the output
contains active (running) . For example:
google-cloud-sap-agent.service - Google Cloud Agent for SAP
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/google-cloud-sap-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
Active: active (running) since Fri 2022-12-02 07:21:42 UTC; 4 days ago
Main PID: 1337673 (google-cloud-sa)
Tasks: 9 (limit: 100427)
Memory: 22.4 M (max: 1.0G limit: 1.0G)
CGroup: /system.slice/google-cloud-sap-agent.service
└─1337673 /usr/bin/google-cloud-sap-agent
If the agent isn't running, then restart the agent .
Verify that SAP Host Agent is receiving metrics
To verify that the infrastructure metrics are collected by
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP and sent correctly to the SAP Host Agent,
follow these steps:
In your SAP system, enter transaction ST06 .
In the overview pane, check the availability and content of the
following fields for the correct end-to-end setup of the SAP and Google
monitoring infrastructure:
Cloud Provider : Google Cloud Platform
Enhanced Monitoring Access : TRUE
Enhanced Monitoring Details : ACTIVE
Set up monitoring for SAP HANA
Optionally, you can monitor your SAP HANA instances using
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP. From version 2.0, you can configure the agent to
collect the SAP HANA monitoring metrics and send them to
Cloud Monitoring .
Cloud Monitoring lets you create dashboards to visualize these metrics,
set up alerts based on metric thresholds, and more.
To monitor an HA cluster using Google Cloud's Agent for SAP, make sure to follow the
guidance given in
High-availability configuration for the agent .
For more information about the collection of SAP HANA monitoring metrics using
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP, see
SAP HANA monitoring metrics collection .
Enable SAP HANA Fast Restart
Google Cloud strongly recommends enabling SAP HANA
Fast Restart for each instance of SAP HANA, especially for larger instances.
SAP HANA Fast Restart reduces restart time in the event that SAP HANA
terminates, but the operating system remains running.
Note: If you deploy SAP HANA using Google Cloud's Terraform module
sap_hana or sap_hana_ha , version 202309280828 or later, or the
Terraform module manual_sap_hana_scaleup_ha ,
then fast restart is automatically enabled.
As configured by the automation scripts that Google Cloud provides,
the operating system and kernel settings already support SAP HANA Fast Restart.
You need to define the tmpfs file system and configure SAP HANA.
To define the tmpfs file system and configure SAP HANA, you can follow
the manual steps or use the automation script that
Google Cloud provides to enable SAP HANA Fast Restart. For more
information, see:
Manual steps: Enable SAP HANA Fast Restart
Automated steps: Enable SAP HANA Fast Restart
For the complete authoritative instructions for SAP HANA Fast Restart,
see the SAP HANA Fast Restart Option documentation .
Manual steps
Configure the tmpfs file system
After the host VMs and the base SAP HANA systems are successfully deployed,
you need to create and mount directories for the NUMA nodes in the tmpfs
file system.
Display the NUMA topology of your VM
Before you can map the required tmpfs file system, you need to know how
many NUMA nodes your VM has. To display the available NUMA nodes on
a Compute Engine VM, enter the following command:
lscpu | grep NUMA
For example, an m2-ultramem-208 VM type has four NUMA nodes,
numbered 0-3, as shown in the following example:
NUMA node(s): 4
NUMA node0 CPU(s): 0-25,104-129
NUMA node1 CPU(s): 26-51,130-155
NUMA node2 CPU(s): 52-77,156-181
NUMA node3 CPU(s): 78-103,182-207
Create the NUMA node directories
Create a directory for each NUMA node in your VM and set the permissions.
For example, for four NUMA nodes that are numbered 0-3:
mkdir -pv /hana/tmpfs{0..3}/ SID
chown -R SID_LC adm:sapsys /hana/tmpfs*/ SID
chmod 777 -R /hana/tmpfs*/ SID
Mount the NUMA node directories to tmpfs
Mount the tmpfs file system directories and specify
a NUMA node preference for each with mpol=prefer :
SID specify the SID with uppercase letters.
mount tmpfs SID 0 -t tmpfs -o mpol=prefer:0 /hana/tmpfs0/ SID
mount tmpfs SID 1 -t tmpfs -o mpol=prefer:1 /hana/tmpfs1/ SID
mount tmpfs SID 2 -t tmpfs -o mpol=prefer:2 /hana/tmpfs2/ SID
mount tmpfs SID 3 -t tmpfs -o mpol=prefer:3 /hana/tmpfs3/ SID
Note: if you change machine types and the NUMA nodes increase or decrease,
you need to modify the tmpfs file system and the [persistence] section
of the SAP HANA INI file, shown in the next section, to match the new
number of NUMA nodes.
Update /etc/fstab
To ensure that the mount points are available after an operating system
reboot, add entries into the file system table, /etc/fstab :
tmpfs SID 0 /hana/tmpfs0/ SID tmpfs rw,nofail,relatime,mpol=prefer:0
tmpfs SID 1 /hana/tmpfs1/ SID tmpfs rw,nofail,relatime,mpol=prefer:1
tmpfs SID 1 /hana/tmpfs2/ SID tmpfs rw,nofail,relatime,mpol=prefer:2
tmpfs SID 1 /hana/tmpfs3/ SID tmpfs rw,nofail,relatime,mpol=prefer:3
Optional: set limits on memory usage
The tmpfs file system can grow and shrink dynamically.
To limit the memory used by the tmpfs file system, you
can set a size limit for a NUMA node volume with the size option.
For example:
mount tmpfs SID 0 -t tmpfs -o mpol=prefer:0,size=250G /hana/tmpfs0/ SID
You can also limit overall tmpfs memory usage for all NUMA nodes for
a given SAP HANA instance and a given server node by setting the
persistent_memory_global_allocation_limit parameter in the [memorymanager]
section of the global.ini file.
SAP HANA configuration for Fast Restart
To configure SAP HANA for Fast Restart, update the global.ini file
and specify the tables to store in persistent memory.
Update the [persistence] section in the global.ini file
Configure the [persistence] section in the SAP HANA global.ini file
to reference the tmpfs locations. Separate each tmpfs location with
a semicolon:
[persistence]
basepath_datavolumes = /hana/data
basepath_logvolumes = /hana/log
basepath_persistent_memory_volumes = /hana/tmpfs0/ SID ;/hana/tmpfs1/ SID ;/hana/tmpfs2/ SID ;/hana/tmpfs3/ SID
The preceding example specifies four memory volumes for four NUMA nodes,
which corresponds to the m2-ultramem-208 . If you were running on
the m2-ultramem-416 , you would need to configure eight memory volumes (0..7).
Restart SAP HANA after modifying the global.ini file.
SAP HANA can now use the tmpfs location as persistent memory space.
Specify the tables to store in persistent memory
Specify specific column tables or partitions to store in persistent memory.
For example, to turn on persistent memory for an existing table, execute
the SQL query:
ALTER TABLE exampletable persistent memory ON immediate CASCADE
To change the default for new tables add the parameter
table_default in the indexserver.ini file. For example:
[persistent_memory]
table_default = ON
For more information on how to control columns, tables and which
monitoring views provide detailed information, see SAP HANA Persistent Memory .
Automated steps
The automation script that Google Cloud provides to enable
SAP HANA Fast Restart
makes changes to directories /hana/tmpfs* , file /etc/fstab , and
SAP HANA configuration. When you run the script, you might need to perform
additional steps depending on whether this is the initial deployment of your
SAP HANA system or you are resizing your machine to a different NUMA size.
For the initial deployment of your SAP HANA system or resizing
the machine to increase the number of NUMA nodes, make sure that SAP HANA
is running during the execution of automation script that Google Cloud
provides to enable SAP HANA Fast Restart.
When you resize your machine to decrease the number of NUMA nodes,
make sure that SAP HANA is stopped during the execution of the automation script
that Google Cloud provides to enable SAP HANA Fast Restart.
After the script is executed, you need to manually update the SAP HANA
configuration to complete the SAP HANA Fast Restart setup. For more information,
see SAP HANA configuration for Fast Restart .
Note: We strongly recommend that you run the script that Google Cloud
provides to enable SAP HANA Fast Restart in a
non-production environment and verify the results thoroughly before running the
script in production environments. You assume the responsibility for correctly
enabling SAP HANA Fast Restart.
To enable SAP HANA Fast Restart, follow these steps:
Establish an SSH connection with your host VM.
Switch to root:
sudo su -
Download the sap_lib_hdbfr.sh script:
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudsapdeploy/terraform/latest/terraform/lib/sap_lib_hdbfr.sh
Make the file executable:
chmod +x sap_lib_hdbfr.sh
Verify that the script has no errors:
vi sap_lib_hdbfr.sh
./sap_lib_hdbfr.sh -help
If the command returns an error, contact Cloud Customer Care.
For more information about contacting Customer Care, see Getting support for SAP on Google Cloud .
Run the script after replacing SAP HANA system ID (SID) and password for
the SYSTEM user of the SAP HANA database. To securely provide the password,
we recommend that you use a secret
in Secret Manager .
Run the script by using the name of a secret in Secret Manager. This
secret must exist in the Google Cloud project that contains your host VM
instance.
sudo ./sap_lib_hdbfr.sh -h ' SID ' -s SECRET_NAME
Replace the following:
SID : specify the SID with uppercase
letters. For example, AHA .
SECRET_NAME : specify the name of the secret
that corresponds to the password for the SYSTEM user of the
SAP HANA database. This secret must exist in the Google Cloud project
that contains your host VM instance.
Alternatively, you can run the script using a plain text password.
After SAP HANA Fast Restart is enabled, make sure to change your
password. Using plain text password is not recommended as your password
would be recorded in the command-line history of your VM.
sudo ./sap_lib_hdbfr.sh -h ' SID ' -p ' PASSWORD '
Replace the following:
SID : specify the SID with uppercase
letters. For example, AHA .
PASSWORD : specify the password for the
SYSTEM user of the SAP HANA database.
For a successful initial run, you should see an output similar to the following:
INFO - Script is running in standalone mode
ls: cannot access '/hana/tmpfs*': No such file or directory
INFO - Setting up HANA Fast Restart for system 'TST/00'.

Connect to SAP HANA
Note that because these instructions don't use an external IP address for SAP
HANA, you can only connect to the SAP HANA instances through the bastion
instance using SSH or through the Windows server through SAP HANA Studio.
To connect to SAP HANA through the bastion instance, connect to the bastion
host, and then to the SAP HANA instance(s) by using an SSH client of
your choice.
To connect to the SAP HANA database through SAP HANA Studio, use a remote
desktop client to connect to the Windows Server instance. After connection,
manually install SAP HANA Studio
and access your SAP HANA database.
Configure HANA Active/Active (Read Enabled)
Starting with SAP HANA 2.0 SPS1, you can configure HANA Active/Active (Read Enabled) in a Pacemaker cluster. For instructions, see:
Configure HANA Active/Active (Read Enabled) in a SUSE Pacemaker cluster
Configure HANA Active/Active (Read Enabled) in a Red Hat Pacemaker cluster
Performing post-deployment tasks
Before using your SAP HANA instance, we recommend that you perform the following
post-deployment steps. For more information, see SAP HANA Installation and
Update Guide .
Change the temporary passwords for the SAP HANA system administrator and
database superuser.
Update the SAP HANA software with the latest patches.
Install any additional components such as Application Function Libraries
(AFL) or Smart Data Access (SDA).
Configure and backup your new SAP HANA database. For more information, see
