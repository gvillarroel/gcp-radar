Reference architecture: SAP S/4HANA on Google Cloud
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This reference architecture is intended for people who are evaluating
Google Cloud as a platform for deploying SAP S/4HANA workloads. It
includes considerations during the planning phase, deployment models and
automation, and common operational procedures like backup and DR tasks.
Google Cloud provides cost-effective, reliable, secure, and
high-performance SAP-certified infrastructure for running SAP S/4HANA on SAP
HANA. For a complete list of supported SAP solutions on Google Cloud, see
SAP on Google Cloud .
Architecture
The following diagrams show a high-level view of three common deployment models
for SAP S/4HANA:
centralized ,
distributed , and
distributed with high availability .
Centralized deployment
In a centralized deployment, you can install SAP S/4HANA and the
SAP HANA
database on the same Compute Engine instance. We recommend this
approach for non-production environments such as sandbox and development
environments.
The following diagram shows a reference architecture for SAP S/4HANA on
SAP HANA in a centralized deployment. Note that SAP ASCS, PAS, WD, and the SAP
HANA database are all installed on the same compute instance.
Distributed deployment
In a distributed deployment, you can install the different components on
different Compute Engine instances. We recommend this approach for
production environments or environments that require a lot of compute power to
handle heavy transaction loads.
The following diagram shows a reference architecture for SAP S/4HANA in
a distributed deployment. Note that SAP ASCS, PAS, WD, and SAP HANA are all
installed on different compute instances.
Distributed deployment with high availability
In a distributed deployment with high availability, Linux clusters are set up
across zones to help guard against component failures in a given region. You can
deploy a Linux cluster across zones using either an active/passive configuration
or an
active/active
configuration. In both cases, you start by setting up two Compute Engine
compute instances in separate zones for maximum redundancy, each with its own SAP
HANA database.
The following diagram shows an SAP S/4HANA architecture that uses a
Linux cluster to achieve high availability on both the application and the SAP
HANA database side:
The following diagrams show an SAP HANA database that is highly available during
both normal operation and a takeover operation:
Normal operation:
Takeover operation:
To combine both high availability and disaster recovery for the database, you
can use SAP HANA System Replication. The following diagram shows
a combination of both to achieve maximum availability and fault tolerance:
The cluster managing the high availability includes the following functions and
features:
Two host compute instances, each with an instance of SAP HANA.
Synchronous SAP HANA system replication.
The Pacemaker high-availability cluster resource manager.
A fencing mechanism that fences off the failed node.
Automatic restart of the failed instance as the new secondary instance
.
The architecture on the application side is similar. In this case, the cluster
manages the ABAP SAP Central Services (ASCS) and the Enqueue Replication Server
or Enqueue Replicator (ERS) that are used to provide the SAP S/4HANA
system with high availability in case something happens to any of the ASCS and
ERS instances.
Depending on the
SAP S/4HANA version you use,
the Enqueue Server and the Enqueue Replication Server / Enqueue Replicator run
on a different version:
S/4HANA 1709 and earlier: ENSA1 and ERS.
S/4HANA 1809 or later: ENSA2 and ERS2.
The following diagram shows an SAP S/4HANA system using a Pacemaker
cluster to limit the single points of failure from both the Message Server and
the Enqueue Server:
Details about the deployment of the high availability system and Linux
clustering across zones are covered later in this document.
A note on load balancing
In a distributed SAP S/4HANA
environment, load balancing is mandatory. You can configure application load
balancing using a combination of the SAP application layer and
Network Load Balancers. For more information, see
Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer VIP implementations
section in the high-availability planning guide for SAP NetWeaver on
Google Cloud.
Deployment components
SAP S/4HANA
consists of the following technical components:
SAP HANA database
ASCS: ABAP SAP Central Services
Contains the Message Server and Enqueue Server, which are required in
any SAP ABAP system.
Deployed either on their own VM instance in HA deployments or deployed
on the VM instance hosting the PAS.
In HA deployments, the ASCS resources are managed by a Linux cluster
resource manager such as Pacemaker.
ERS: Enqueue Replication Server or Enqueue Replicator
Deployed in HA deployments to keep a replica of the lock table in case
something happens to the ASCS instance.
Managed by a Linux cluster resource manager such as Pacemaker.
PAS: Primary Application Server
The first or only application server for the SAP system.
AAS: Additional Application Server
Usually deployed for application level load balancing. You can install
multiple AAS instances to achieve higher availability from an application layer
perspective as well. If one of the application servers goes down, then all
user sessions connected to that application server are terminated, but users
can sign in again to the other AAS in the environment.
SAP NetWeaver gateway
Deployed either as a standalone system or as part of the
SAP S/4HANA system.
Allows the system to connect devices, environments, and platforms to
SAP systems using Open Data Protocol (OData).
SAP Fiori front-end server
Deployed either as a standalone system or as part of the
SAP S/4HANA system.
The SAP Netweaver ABAP system is used to host SAP Fiori applications.
WD: Web Dispatcher (optional)
Intelligent software load balancer that distributes HTTP and HTTPS
requests, based on application type, to PAS and AAS.
The following Google Cloud services are used in the SAP S/4HANA
deployment:
Service
Description
VPC networking
Connects your Compute Engine instances to each other and to the internet.
Each compute instance is a member of either a legacy network with a single
global IP range, or a recommended subnet network, where the instance is
a member of a single subnetwork that is a member of a larger network.
Note that a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network cannot span
Google Cloud projects, but a Google Cloud project can have multiple
VPC networks.
To connect resources from multiple projects to a common
VPC network, you can use
Shared VPC , so that the
resources can communicate with each other securely and efficiently by
using internal IP addresses from that network. For information about how
to provision a Shared VPC including requirements, configuration
steps, and usage, see
Provision Shared VPC .
Compute Engine
Creates and manages compute instances with your choice of operating system and software
stack.
Persistent Disk and
Hyperdisk
You can use Persistent Disk and Google Cloud Hyperdisk:
Persistent Disk volumes are available as either standard hard disk
drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD). For Balanced Persistent Disk
and SSD Persistent Disk volumes,
PD Async Replication
provides asynchronous replication of SAP data between two
Google Cloud regions.
Hyperdisk Extreme volumes provide higher maximum
IOPS and throughput options than SSD Persistent Disk volumes.
Compute Engine enables
default encryption at rest ,
including content inside Persistent Disk and
Hyperdisk volumes. For more information about disk
encryption and possible encryption options, see
About disk encryption .
Google Cloud console
A browser-based tool for managing Compute Engine resources.
Use a template to describe all of the Compute Engine resources
and instances you need. You don't have to individually create and
configure the resources or figure out dependencies because the
Google Cloud console does that for you.
Cloud Storage
You can store your SAP database backups in Cloud Storage for
added durability and reliability, with replication.
Cloud Monitoring
Provides visibility into the deployment, performance, uptime, and
health of Compute Engine, network, and persistent storage disks.
Monitoring collects metrics, events, and metadata from
Google Cloud and uses these to generate insights through dashboards,
charts, and alerts. You can monitor the compute metrics at no cost through
Monitoring.
IAM
Provides unified control over permissions for Google Cloud resources.
IAM lets you control who can perform control-plane
operations on your compute instances, including creating, modifying, and deleting
instances and persistent storage disks, and creating and modifying networks.
Filestore
High-performance, fully managed NFS file storage from Google Cloud.
For multi-zonal high-availability deployments, we recommend using
Filestore Regional (formerly Enterprise) that has 99.99% availability SLA.
For information about the Filestore service tiers, see
Service tiers .
NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP
A full-featured, smart storage solution that you deploy and manage
yourself on a compute instance.
For more information about NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP, see
Overview of Cloud Volumes ONTAP .
Google Cloud NetApp Volumes
A fully managed NFS and SMB file storage solution from
Google Cloud, powered by NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
Depending on the region, there can be multiple service levels
available to select from. For more information, see
Service levels .
Design considerations
This section provides guidance to help you use this reference architecture to
develop an architecture that meets your specific requirements for security,
reliability, operational efficiency, cost, and performance.
Networking
There are multiple ways to deploy an SAP S/4HANA system from the
networking perspective and how you deploy your network has a significant impact
on its availability, resilience, and performance. As mentioned earlier, a
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private network hosted within
Google Cloud. VPCs are global in Google Cloud, so a single VPC can
span multiple regions without communicating across the internet.
A typical SAP deployment places the instances of HA systems in different zones
in the same region to ensure resilience while providing low latency. Subnets can
span multiple zones due to Google Cloud capabilities. These capabilities
also simplify SAP clustering because the cluster's virtual IP (VIP) address can
be in the same range as the instances of the HA systems. This configuration
shields the floating IP by using an internal Application Load Balancer and is applicable to HA
clustering of the application layer (ASCS and ERS) and the
SAP HANA database layer (SAP HANA primary and secondary).
There are multiple ways to build your network and connect your SAP S/4HANA
system with your infrastructure:
VPC Network Peering connects two VPC
networks so that resources in each network can communicate with each other.
The VPC networks can be hosted in the same Google Cloud project, different
projects of the same organization, or even different projects of different
organizations. VPC Network Peering establishes a direct connection between
two VPC networks, each one using their own subnets, enabling private
communication between resources in the peered VPCs.
Shared VPC is a feature in Google Cloud
that lets an organization connect resources from multiple projects to a
common VPC network. The systems using a Shared VPC can communicate
efficiently and securely using internal IP addresses. You can centrally manage
network resources such as subnets, routes, and firewalls in a host project,
while delegating administrative responsibilities for creating and managing
individual resources to service projects. This separation of concerns
simplifies network administration and enforces consistent security policies
across your organization.
For SAP systems, it is generally recommended to group resources by environment
type. For example, production environments must not share computing resources
with non-production environments so as to provide adequate isolation, but you
can use a Shared VPC for a common layer of connectivity between your
projects. You can also use independent VPCs and use VPC peering to connect
projects.
While designing your network, start with a host project containing one or more
Shared VPC networks. You can attach additional service projects to a
host project, which allows the service projects to participate in the
Shared VPC. Depending on your needs, you can deploy SAP S/4HANA
on a single Shared VPC or multiple shared VPCs. The two scenarios differ
in terms of network control, SAP environment isolation, and network inspection:
Scenario 1: Deploying SAP S/4HANA on a single Shared VPC. This
simplifies the deployment and reduces administrative overhead at the expense
of lower isolation between networks.
Scenario 2: Deploying SAP S/4HANA on multiple shared VPCs. This
increases network isolation and adds security at the expense of increasing the
complexity and the administrative overhead.
It is also possible to use a hybrid approach. For example, you can use one
Shared VPC for the production environment and one Shared VPC for
all non-production systems. For more information, see the "Networking" section
in
General checklist for SAP on Google Cloud .
Single points of failure
An SAP S/4HANA system
has some common single points of failure that can impact the availability of the
system:
SAP Central Services such as Message Server and Enqueue Server
SAP Application Server
SAP HANA database
SAP Web Dispatcher, if used as a frontend for HTTP/HTTPS access to the system
Shared storage such as NFS
There are multiple options for reducing the impact of such single points
of failure, and these options involve deploying the system using
high-availability solutions, replication services, or using other
functionalities that protect the system from failures. When planning your
SAP S/4HANA system
we recommend that you study such single points of failure and plan accordingly.
For an overview about the alternative solutions that you can use to manage
single points of failure, see the following sections in this guide:
Availability and continuity
Deployment architecture
for SAP HANA
Deployment architecture
for SAP S/4HANA
Availability and continuity
During the planning phase of implementing an SAP S/4HANA
system,
you need to specify the following data points for defining the system's
availability and continuity:
Service Level Objectives (SLO) : A target value or range of values for a
service level that is measured by a service level indicator (SLI). For
example: performance, availability, and reliability.
Service Level Indicators (SLI) : Metrics, such as latency, that help in
measuring the performance of a service. It is a carefully defined quantitative
measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.
Service Level Agreement (SLA) : A service contract between two parties
(provider, customer) that defines an agreement about the provided service in
measurable terms called Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) : The maximum tolerable duration between a
data-loss incident and its mitigation.
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) : The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the
maximum amount of data that can be lost, measured in time, without causing
significant harm. Practically, this translates to the point in time at which
the state of the impacted data must be recovered following a data loss event.
Depending on the data points and the agreed values between all the stakeholders,
the SAP S/4HANA system relies on capabilities such as high availability
or disaster recovery:
High Availability (HA) : The capability of a system that supports the goal
of business continuity while ensuring that data and services are available for
users when needed. The usual way to achieve this capability is by enabling
redundancy, including hardware redundancy, network redundancy, and data center
redundancy.
Disaster Recovery (DR) : The capability of a system to be protected from
unplanned outages through reliable and predictable recovery methods on a
different hardware and/or physical location.
Both high availability and disaster recovery are compatible, but they cover
different cases and situations. For example, an HA solution lets you continue
with your operations if one of the elements of the system has an unplanned
downtime or outage without causing any interruption for your users. The same can
be said about a DR solution with the exception of experiencing an interruption
from the moment the outage occurs until the DR solution starts the faulty
elements of the system on a different location.
The ensuing sections provide an overview of the different options that you have
when planning and deploying your SAP S/4HANA system
on Google Cloud.
Supported machine types for SAP S/4HANA
Google Cloud offers Compute Engine VM instance types that are
certified by SAP to match sizing requirements when you're deploying
SAP S/4HANA.
For more information about sizing on Google Cloud and the machine types
that are supported, see the following documents:
Supported machine types for SAP HANA on Google Cloud
Supported machine types for SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud
Custom machine types for SAP HANA on Google Cloud are also certified
by SAP. You can run SAP HANA instances with less than 64 vCPUs as long as
you maintain a vCPU-to-Memory ratio of at least 1:6.5.
To see the SAPS numbers for the Compute Engine virtual
machines that are certified for SAP applications, see the SAP note
SAP Note 2456432 - SAP Applications on Google Cloud: Supported Products and
Google Cloud machine types .
SAP provides a certified list of Google Cloud configurations for SAP
HANA on its website as well. For more information, see
Certified and Supported SAP HANA Hardware Directory .
Plan regions and zones
When you deploy a Compute Engine instance, you must choose a region and
zone. A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your
resources, and corresponds to one or more data center locations in relatively
close proximity to each other. Each region has one or more zones with redundant
connectivity, power, and cooling.
Global resources, such as pre-configured disk images and disk snapshots, can be
accessed across regions and zones. Regional resources, such as regional static
external IP addresses, can only be accessed by resources that are in the same
region. Zonal resources, such as compute instances and disks, can only be
accessed by resources that are located in the same zone. For more information, see
Global, regional, and zonal resources .
When you choose a region and zone for your compute instances, consider the
following:
The location of your users and your internal resources, such as your data
center or corporate network. To decrease latency, select a location that is in
close proximity to your users and resources.
The CPU platforms that are available for that region and zone. For example,
Intel's Broadwell, Haswell, Skylake, and Ice Lake processors are supported for
workloads of SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud.
For more information, see the SAP note
SAP Note 2456432 - SAP Applications on Google Cloud: Supported Products and
Google Cloud machine types .
For details about which regions the Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake, and
Ice Lake processors are available for use with Compute Engine,
see Available regions
and zones .
Ensure that your SAP Application Server and your database are in the same
region.
Storage options for SAP S/4HANA
The following are the storage options offered by Google Cloud that are
certified by SAP for use with SAP S/4HANA and
SAP HANA.
For general information about storage options in Google Cloud, see
Storage options .
Persistent Disk
Standard Persistent Disk ( pd-standard ): efficient and economical block
storage backed by
standard hard disk drives (HDD)
for handling sequential read-write operations, but not optimized to handle
high rates of random input-output operations per second (IOPS).
SSD Persistent Disk ( pd-ssd ): provides reliable, high-performance block
storage backed by
solid-state drives (SSD) .
Balanced Persistent Disk ( pd-balanced ): provides cost-effective and
reliable SSD-based block storage.
Extreme Persistent Disk ( pd-extreme ): SSD-based; provides higher maximum
IOPS and throughput options than pd-ssd for larger Compute Engine
machine types. For more information, see
Extreme persistent disks .
Hyperdisk
Hyperdisk Extreme ( hyperdisk-extreme ): provides higher
maximum IOPS and throughput options than SSD based Persistent Disk volumes.
You select the performance needed by provisioning IOPS, which determines the
throughput.
Its best use is
to host the /hana/data and /hana/log directories.
For more information, see
About Google Cloud Hyperdisk Extreme .
Hyperdisk Balanced ( hyperdisk-balanced ): The best fit for
most workloads. We recommend this option for use with databases that don't
require the performance of Hyperdisk Extreme. You select the
performance you need by provisioning the IOPS and throughput.
You can use
Hyperdisk Balanced volumes to host the /hana/data and
/hana/log directories.
For more information, see
About Google Cloud Hyperdisk Balanced .
Persistent Disk and Hyperdisk are designed
for high durability. They store data redundantly to ensure data integrity. Each
Persistent Disk volume can store up to 64 TB, so you can create large logical
volumes without managing arrays of disks. Hyperdisk volumes also
allow up to 64 TB of storage, depending on the type you use. One key feature is
that Persistent Disk and Hyperdisk volumes are automatically
encrypted to protect data.
Upon creation, a Compute Engine VM instance allocates a single root
Persistent Disk or Hyperdisk by default that contains the
operating system. You can add more storage options to the VM instance as
required.
For SAP implementations, review the recommended storage options in the
SAP directory structure and storage options .
File sharing solutions
Several file sharing solutions are available on Google Cloud, including
the following:
Filestore: Google Cloud high-performance, fully managed
NFS file storage with regional availability.
Google Cloud NetApp Volumes: A fully managed NFS or SMB file storage solution from
Google Cloud.
NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP: A full-featured, smart storage solution that you deploy
and manage yourself on a Compute Engine VM.
For more information about file sharing solutions for SAP S/4HANA on
Google Cloud, see
File sharing solutions for SAP on Google Cloud .
Cloud Storage for object storage
Cloud Storage is an object store for files of any type or format; it
has virtually unlimited storage, and you don't have to worry about provisioning
it or adding more capacity. An object in
Cloud Storage contains file data and its associated metadata, and can
be up to 5 TB in size. A Cloud Storage bucket
can store any number of objects.
It's common practice to use Cloud Storage to store backup files for
nearly any purpose. For example, Cloud Storage is a good place to store
the
SAP HANA
database backups. For information about database backup planning, see
Database backup and recovery .
You can also use Cloud Storage as part of a
migration process .
Additionally you can use Backup and DR Service as a centralized
solution for backup and disaster recovery operations. This service supports a
broad spectrum of databases including
SAP HANA.
For more information, see
Backup and Disaster Recovery Solutions with Google Cloud .
Choose your Cloud Storage option based on how frequently you need to
access the data. For frequent access, such as multiple times a month, select the
Standard storage class. For infrequent access, select Nearline
or Coldline storage. For archived data, which you don't expect to
access, select Archive storage.
SAP directory structure and storage options
The following tables describe the Linux directory structures for SAP HANA
databases and SAP ABAP instances on Google Cloud.
Recommended storage options for Linux directory structure on SAP HANA:
SAP HANA directory
Recommended storage option in Google Cloud

network file system using an NFS solution such as
Filestore .
For information about persistent disk storage that SAP has certified for use
with SAP ABAP instances, see
Persistent disk storage for SAP applications .
OS support for SAP S/4HANA
When choosing an operating system (OS) for SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud,
in addition to confirming that the OS version is certified by SAP, you also need
to confirm that all three companies, SAP, the OS vendor, and Google Cloud,
still support the OS version.
Your decision must also take into account the following:
Whether a given OS version is available from Google Cloud. The
OS images provided by Compute Engine are
configured to work with Google Cloud. If an OS is not available from
Google Cloud, then you can bring your own OS image (BYOI) and license.
BYOI OS images are referred to by Compute Engine as
custom images .
The available licensing options for a given OS version. Review if the OS
version has an on-demand licensing option or if you need to
bring-your-own-subscription (BYOS) from the OS vendor.
Whether the integrated high-availability capabilities of a given OS version
are enabled for Google Cloud.
The committed use discount option
for SLES for SAP and RHEL for SAP images.
The following operating systems are certified by SAP for use with SAP NetWeaver
on Google Cloud:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
You can find more information about specific OS versions and their compatibility
with both SAP S/4HANA and
SAP HANA in the following guides:
OS support for SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud
OS support for SAP HANA on Google Cloud
SAP HANA Fast Restart option
For SAP HANA 2.0 SP04 and later, Google strongly recommends the
SAP HANA Fast Restart option .
This option is automatically enabled when you deploy SAP HANA using the
following Terraform modules provided by Google Cloud: module sap_hana or
sap_hana_ha , version 202309280828 or later. For information about how to
manually enable SAP HANA Fast Restart, see
Enable the SAP HANA Fast Restart option .
SAP HANA Fast Restart reduces restart time in the event that SAP HANA
terminates, but the operating system remains running. To reduce the restart
time, SAP HANA leverages the SAP HANA persistent memory feature to preserve
MAIN data fragments of column store tables in DRAM that is mapped to the
tmpfs file system.
Additionally, on VMs in the M2 and M3 families of Compute Engine
memory-optimized machine types, SAP HANA Fast Restart improves recovery time if
uncorrectable errors occur in memory. For more information, see
SAP HANA Fast Restart option .
Deployment architecture for SAP HANA
SAP HANA is a key component of any SAP S/4HANA system because it serves
as a database for the system. There are two possible architectures that you can
use when deploying the SAP HANA database: scale-up and
scale-out .
Scale-up architecture
The following diagram shows a scale-up architecture for SAP HANA on
Google Cloud. In the diagram, notice both the deployment on
Google Cloud and the disk layout. You can use Cloud Storage to
back up your local backups available in /hanabackup . This mount must be sized
equal to or greater than the data mount.
Scale-out architecture
The scale-out architecture for SAP HANA consists of one master host, a number of
worker hosts, and, optionally, one or more standby hosts. The hosts are
interconnected through a network that supports sending data between hosts at
rates of up to 32 Gbps, or up to 100 Gbps on selected machine types using
high-bandwidth networking .
As the workload demand increases, especially when using Online Analytical
Processing (OLAP), a multi-host scale-out architecture can distribute the
load across all hosts.
The following diagram shows a scale-out architecture for SAP HANA on
Google Cloud:
Deployment architecture for SAP S/4HANA
As mentioned in the Architecture section, there are multiple
deployment architectures that you can use for deploying SAP S/4HANA
on Google Cloud.
Two-tier architecture
This architecture is presented in the
centralized deployment section. The following diagram
shows some details of a two-tier architecture for SAP S/4HANA running on
a Compute Engine VM:
Three-tier architecture
This architecture is presented in the
distributed deployment section. You can use this
architecture to deploy high-availability SAP S/4HANA systems. The
following diagram shows some details of a three-tier architecture for
SAP S/4HANA running on Compute Engine VMs:
In this architecture, the SAP S/4HANA system distributes work across
multiple NetWeaver Application Servers (AS), each hosted on a separate VM. All
the NetWeaver AS nodes share the same database, which is hosted on a separate
VM. All the NetWeaver AS nodes mount and access a shared file system that hosts
the SAP NetWeaver profiles. This shared file system is hosted on a
Persistent Disk volume shared across all nodes or on a supported
file sharing solution .
Security, privacy, and compliance
This section provides information about security, privacy, and compliance for
running SAP S/4HANA
on Google Cloud.
Compliance and sovereign controls
If you require your SAP workload to run in compliance with data residency, access control, support
personnel, or regulatory requirements, then you must plan for using Assured Workloads
- a service that helps you run secure and compliant workloads on Google Cloud without
compromising the quality of your cloud experience.
For more information, see Compliance and sovereign controls
for SAP on Google Cloud .
Networking and network security
Consider the information in the following sections when planning networking and
network security.
Minimum privilege model
One of your first lines of defense is to restrict who can reach your network and
your VMs. You do this by using
VPC firewall rules . By default,
all traffic to VMs, even from other VMs, is blocked by the firewall unless you
create rules to allow access. The exception is the default network that is
created automatically with each project and has default
firewall rules .
By creating VPC firewall rules, you can restrict all traffic on a
given set of ports to specific source IP addresses. To restrict access to the
specific IP addresses, protocols, and ports that need access, follow the minimum
privilege model. For example, always set up a
bastion host and allow SSH
communications to your SAP NetWeaver system only from that host.
Custom networks and firewall rules
You can use a network to define a gateway IP and the network range for the VMs
attached to that network. All Compute Engine networks use the
IPv4 protocol. Every
Google Cloud project is provided with a default network with preset
configurations and firewall rules, but we recommend that you add a custom
subnetwork and add firewall rules based on a
minimum privilege model . By default, a newly created
network has no firewall rules and hence no network access.
You might want to add more than one subnetwork if you want to isolate parts of
your network, or satisfy other requirements. For more information, see
Networks and subnets .
The firewall rules apply to the entire network and all the VMs in the network.
You can add a firewall rule that allows traffic between VMs in the same network
and across subnetworks. You can also configure firewalls to apply to specific
target VMs by using network tags .
SAP requires access to certain ports, so add firewall rules to allow access to
the
ports outlined by SAP .
Routes
Routes are global resources attached to a single network.
User-created routes apply to all VMs in a network. This means you can add a
route that forwards traffic from VM to VM within the same network and across
subnetworks without requiring external IP addresses.
For external access to internet resources, launch a VM with no external IP
address and configure another VM as a NAT gateway. This configuration requires
you to add your NAT gateway as a route for your SAP instance.
Bastion hosts and NAT gateways
If your security policy requires truly internal VMs, then you need to manually
set up a NAT proxy on your network and a corresponding route so that VMs can
reach the internet. It is important to note that you cannot directly connect to
a fully internal VM instance by using SSH.
To connect to such internal machines, you must set up a bastion instance that
has an external IP address and then tunnel through it. When VMs don't have
external IP addresses, they can only be reached by other VMs on the network, or
through a managed VPN gateway. You can provision VMs in your network to act as
trusted relays for inbound connections, called bastion hosts , or network
egress, called NAT gateways . For more transparent connectivity without setting
up such connections, you can use a managed VPN gateway resource.
Bastion hosts for inbound connections
Bastion hosts
provide an external facing point of entry into a network containing
private-network VMs. This host can provide a single point of fortification or
audit and can be started and stopped to enable or disable inbound SSH
communication from the internet.
SSH access to VMs that don't have an external IP address can be achieved by
first connecting to a bastion host. A complete hardening of a bastion host is
outside the scope of this document, but some initial steps taken can include:
Limit the CIDR range of source IPs that can communicate with the bastion.
Configure firewall rules to allow SSH traffic to private VMs from only the
bastion host.
By default, SSH on VMs is configured to use private keys for authentication.
When using a bastion host, you log into the bastion host first, and then into
your target private VM. Due to this two-step login, we recommend that you use
SSH-agent forwarding to reach the target VM instead of storing the target VM's
private key on the bastion host. You must do this even if you are using the same
key-value pair for both bastion and target VMs because the bastion has direct
access only to the public half of the key-pair.
NAT gateways for outbound data transfer
When a VM does not have an assigned, external IP address, it cannot make direct
connections to external services, including other Google Cloud services.
To let these VMs to reach services on the internet, you can set up and configure
a NAT gateway . The NAT gateway is a VM that can route
traffic on behalf of any other VM on the network. Use one NAT gateway per
network. A single-VM NAT gateway is not highly available and cannot support high
traffic throughput for multiple VMs. For information about how to set up a VM to
act as a NAT gateway, see the deployment guide for your operating system:
SAP NetWeaver on Linux Deployment Guide
SAP NetWeaver on Windows Deployment Guide
Cloud VPN
You can securely connect your existing network to Google Cloud through a
VPN
connection that uses
IPsec by using
Cloud VPN. Traffic traveling between the two networks is encrypted by
one VPN gateway, then decrypted by the other VPN gateway. This protects your
data as it travels over the internet. You can dynamically control which VMs can
send traffic down the VPN by using instance tags on routes. Cloud VPN
tunnels are billed at a static monthly rate plus standard charges for outbound
data transfer. Note that connecting two networks in the same project still
incurs standard charges for outbound data transfer. For more information, see:
Cloud VPN overview
Choosing Cloud VPN for networking connectivity
Security for Cloud Storage buckets
If you use Cloud Storage to host your backups for your data and log
volumes, then make sure you use TLS (HTTPS) while sending data to
Cloud Storage from your VMs to protect data in transit.
While Cloud Storage automatically encrypts data at rest, you can
instead specify your own encryption keys if you have your own key-management
system.
Email notification limits
To help protect your systems and Google's from abuse, Google Cloud
enforces limitations for sending email from Compute Engine. This has
implications for the SCOT transaction on SAP NetWeaver ABAP systems because
it requires a specific configuration compared to on-premises systems.
For more information, including information about configuring SCOT, see
Sending email from an instance .

Reliability

running SAP S/4HANA
on Google Cloud.
High availability and disaster recovery
High availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) are sets of techniques,
engineering practices, and design principles to enable business continuity in
the event of failures. These approaches work by eliminating single points of
failure and providing the ability to rapidly resume operations after a system or
component outage with minimal business disruption. Fault recovery is the process
of recovering and resuming operations after an outage due to a failed component.
For example, the following are some HA and DR tools that you can use:
Linux clustering across zones: For more information check the
High-availability planning guide for SAP NetWeaver on Google Cloud
and SAP HANA high-availability planning guide .
Live migration
VM host maintenance policy
Service Auto-Restart
Backups
Here are some further details about some of these tools:
Linux clustering across zones : Setting up your Linux cluster across
zones helps guard against component failures in
a given region.
On the SAP NetWeaver application layer, you can deploy a Linux cluster across
zones to reduce the impact of a failure on the ASCS and make it
highly available across both nodes on different zones. The Linux cluster then
moves the ASCS to the standby node in case the primary node has any issue or
maintenance is being performed. Additionally you can use an Enqueue
Replication Server to replicate the content of the enqueue table so
that the Enqueue Server maintains the content of the enqueue table on the
standby node in case the process is promoted from primary to standby.
On the SAP HANA database layer, you can deploy a Linux cluster across zones
using either an active/passive configuration or an active/active
configuration. In both cases, you start by setting up two
Compute Engine instances in separate zones, each with its own SAP HANA
database.
Active/passive configuration : Configure one instance as the cluster's
primary node (active) and the other as the secondary node (passive). Use SAP
HANA System Replication (SR) to configure the secondary node to take over as
the primary if the primary fails. For more information about how to configure
and set up HANA SR, see
HANA System Replication .
Active/active configuration (read-enabled) : Configure both instances to
be active, but the secondary node as read-only. This setup is based on
continuous log replay. The virtual IP (VIP) is configured to point to the
current read/write node. For more information, see
Active/Active (Read Enabled) .
Additionally it is possible to use SAP HANA System Replication as a Disaster
Recovery solution. The primary database replicates its content to the standby
database, which can be used in case the primary goes offline, allowing the SAP
system to keep working until the service on the primary database is restored.
Promoting the secondary node in this case doesn't happen automatically; it
must be performed manually. You can also combine both HA and DR on the SAP
HANA side to increase resilience and availability. For more information, see:
SAP HANA high-availability planning guide
SAP HANA disaster recovery planning guide
Live migration : Compute Engine offers live migration to keep your
VM instances running even when a host system event occurs, such as a software
or hardware update. In that situation, Compute Engine performs a live
migration of
your running instance to another host in the same zone, rather than requiring
your running instance to be rebooted. The mechanism replicates the original
instance's VM state, so when the new instance comes up, it already has the
original instance's memory pre-loaded.
In the rare case when live migration doesn't happen, the failed virtual
machine is automatically restarted on the new hardware within the same zone.
For more information, see
Live migration process during maintenance events .
Cost optimization
This section provides information about licensing, discounts, and estimating
workload size.
Licensing
If you're an SAP customer, then you can use your existing license to deploy SAP
SAP S/4HANA on Google Cloud under a bring-your-own-license (BYOL)
model. Google Cloud supports the BYOL model for both production and
non-production use cases. Operating system licenses are included in
Compute Engine prices.
Alternatively, you can bring your own OS image and licenses as well. For more
information, see Custom OS images .
Discounts
With Google Cloud's pay-as-you-go pricing model, you only pay for the
services you use. You don't have to be committed to a particular size or
service; you can alter or stop your usage as required. For predictable
workloads, Compute Engine provides committed use discounts (CUDs) that
help to reduce the cost of your infrastructure by committing to a contract in
return for heavily discounted VM usage prices.
Google Cloud offers these discounts in return for purchasing committed use
contracts, also known as commitments . When you purchase a commitment, you
commit either to a minimum amount of resource usage or to a minimum spend amount
for a specified term of one or three years. These discounts help you lower your
monthly bill for those resources used by your SAP S/4HANA system. For
more information, see
Committed use discounts (CUDs) .
Size estimations
The following resources provide information about how to perform size
estimations for your SAP systems before migrating them to Google Cloud:

Operational efficiency
This section provides information about how you can optimize the operational
efficiency of SAP S/4HANA
on Google Cloud.
Backup and recovery
Create backups of your application server and database on a regular basis so
that you can recover in case of a system crash, data corruption, or any other
issue.
You have a number of options to back up your
SAP HANA
data on Google Cloud, including the following:
Back up using Google's
Backup and DR Service . For
more information, see
Back up a discovered SAP HANA database and its logs .
Back up directly to Cloud Storage using the SAP-certified
Backint feature of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP .
Back up to a disk and then uploading the backups to
Cloud Storage.
Back up disks using snapshots .
Back up to Cloud Storage
From version 3.0, Google Cloud's Agent for SAP supports the Backint feature, which
allows SAP HANA to back up and recover database backups directly from
Cloud Storage. This new feature is available for SAP HANA instances running
on Compute Engine instances, on premises
servers, or on other cloud platforms so you can back up directly to, and recover
from, Cloud Storage without needing persistent disk storage for your
backups. For more information, see the
SAP HANA operations guide .
For information about the SAP certification of this feature of the agent,
see the SAP note
2031547 - Overview of SAP-certified 3rd party backup tools and associated support process .
The following diagram shows the flow of backups when you use the Backint feature
of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP:
Back up to disks
You can use the native SAP HANA backup and recovery function with
Compute Engine Persistent Disk volumes and use a
Cloud Storage bucket for longer-term storage of the backups.
During normal operation, SAP HANA automatically saves data from memory to disk
at regular save points. Additionally, all data changes are captured in redo log
entries. A redo log entry is written to disk after each committed database
transaction.
From SAP HANA 2.0 and later, use SAP HANA cockpit to create SAP HANA backups.
The following diagram shows the flow of the backup feature for SAP HANA:
Back up disks using snapshots
Another option that you can add to your backup strategy is to take snapshots of
entire disks by using the disk snapshot feature
of Compute Engine. For example, you can take scheduled snapshots of the
disk hosting your /hanabackup directory for use in disaster recovery
scenarios. It is also possible to use disk snapshots to back up and recover your
SAP HANA data volume. To ensure application consistency, take snapshots when no
changes are being made to the target volume. Snapshots occur on the block level.
After the first snapshot, each subsequent snapshot is incremental and stores
only incremental block changes, as shown in the following diagram.
When you're using version 3.0 or later of Google Cloud's Agent for SAP, you can
create backups and perform recovery for SAP HANA using the agent's disk snapshot
feature. For more information, see
Backup and recovery for SAP HANA by using disk snapshots .
Recovery
The recovery tools in SAP HANA can recover to the latest point in time or a
specific point in time, and you can use these tools to restore to a new system
or create a copy of the database. Unlike backups, which you can run while the
database is operational, you can use recovery tools only while the database is
shut down. You can choose an appropriate option from the following:
Restore to the most recent state, using any of the following resources:
Full backup or snapshot
Log backups
Redo log entries that are still available
Restore to a point in time in the past.
Restore to a specified full backup.
Monitoring
To monitor and provide support for SAP workloads running on
Compute Engine instances,
Google Cloud provides the Agent for SAP.
As mandated by SAP, to get support from SAP and to enable SAP to meet its
service-level agreements (SLAs), you must install
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP on
all Compute Engine instances that run
any SAP system. For more information about the support prerequisites, see SAP
note
SAP Note 2456406 - SAP on Google Cloud Platform: Support Prerequisites .
In addition to the mandatory collection of SAP Host Agent metrics, on Linux,
Google Cloud's Agent for SAP includes optional features such as collection of
Process monitoring metrics and Workload Manager evaluation
metrics. You can opt in to these features that enable products and services such
as
workload management for your SAP workloads.
Performance optimization
This section provides information about optimizing the performance of
SAP S/4HANA workloads through sizing and network configuration.
Sizing
Several sizing options are available based on the implementation type. For
greenfield implementations, we recommend using the SAP Quick Sizer tool. For
detailed information, see SAP's
Sizing
page. SAP also provides T-shirt guides for specific solutions and tools for
migrating current on-premises solutions to Google Cloud. For example, see
Certified and Supported SAP HANA Hardware Directory and
the SAP note
SAP Note 2456432 - SAP Applications on Google Cloud: Supported Products and
Google Cloud machine types . SAP and Google Cloud use different
units to measure IOPS (input/output operations per second). Consult your SI
(Systems Integrator) partner to convert SAP sizing requirements into
appropriately sized Google Cloud infrastructure.
Before you migrate existing systems from SAP ECC to S/4HANA, SAP recommends that
you run the /SDF/HDB_SIZING report, as described in SAP note
1872170 - ABAP on HANA sizing report (S/4HANA, Suite on HANA...) .
This sizing report analyzes your source system's current memory and processing
needs and provides information about the requirements for moving to S/4HANA.
Network configuration
Your Compute Engine VM network capabilities are determined by its
machine family, and not by its network interface (NIC) or IP address.
Based on its machine type, your VM instance is capable of 2 to 32 Gbps network
throughput. Certain machine types also support throughputs up to 100 Gbps, which
requires the use of the Google Virtual NIC (gVNIC) interface type with a Tier_1
network configuration. The ability to achieve these throughput rates is further
dependent on the traffic direction and the type of the destination IP address.
Compute Engine VM network interfaces are backed by redundant and
resilient network infrastructure using physical and software-defined network
components. These interfaces inherit the redundancy and resiliency of the
underlying platform. Multiple virtual NICs can be used for traffic separation,
but that offers no additional resilience or performance benefits.
A single NIC provides the needed performance for
SAP HANAdeployments on
Compute Engine. Your particular use case, security requirements, or
preferences might also require additional interfaces for separating traffic,
such as internet traffic, internal
SAP HANA System Replication
traffic, or other
flows that might benefit from specific network policy rules. We recommend that
you employ the traffic encryption offered by the application, and secure network
access by following a least-privilege firewall policy to restrict access.
Consider the need for traffic separation early on as part of your network design
and allocate additional NICs when you deploy VMs. Your choice for the number of network
interfaces depends on the level of isolation that you require. For more information
about multi-NIC VMs, such as network and subnetwork requirements and the maximum
number of network interfaces, see multiple network interfaces .
For example, you might define a VPC network for your SAP HANA SQL
application clients, such as SAP NetWeaver application servers and custom
applications, and a separate VPC network for inter-server
traffic, such as SAP HANA System Replication. Consider that too many segments
might complicate management and troubleshooting of network issues. If you change
your mind later, then you can use Compute Engine
machine images to recreate your VM instance
while retaining all associated configuration, metadata, and data.
