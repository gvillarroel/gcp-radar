This quickstart shows you how to invoke a function that
publishes a message constructed from the arguments that the function receives,
using the Cloud Run functions API.
Before you begin
Before you run this quickstart, make sure that you or your administrators have
completed the following prerequisites:
You have a Google Cloud account and project.
Billing is enabled for your project. See how to confirm that billing is enabled for your project .
The on-premises or any cloud edition of ABAP SDK for Google Cloud is installed and configured. See how to install and configure the on-premises or any cloud edition of ABAP SDK for Google Cloud .
Make sure that the Cloud Run functions API is enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Go to API library
Depending on the environment where your SAP system is hosted, set up
authentication for invoking Cloud Run functions. For instructions,
see Authentication to invoke Cloud Run functions . Configure the client keys as follows:
To access the Cloud Run function endpoint, create a client key named DEMO-CF .
To invoke the Cloud Run function, create a client key named DEMO-CF-INVOKER .
In the Google Cloud console, write a 2nd gen HTTP function, cf-gen2-hello-with-args ,
that publishes a message using the provided arguments:
exports.helloWorld = (req, res) => {
let name = req.body.name || req.query.name;
let full_name = `${req.body.firstname} ${req.body.lastname}`;
res.status(200).send(`Hello ${name}! Full Name: ${full_name}`);
};
For information about how to write HTTP functions, see Write Cloud Run functions .
Create a program to invoke Cloud Run functions
In the SAP system, create an executable program in your
custom namespace (for example, Z or Y ) by using transaction SE38 .
In the SAP GUI, enter transaction code SE38 .
In the Program field, enter a name of your program.
For example, ZDEMO_CLOUDFUNC_INVOKER .
Click Create .
Specify the program attributes:
In the Title field, enter a title of your program,
for example, Invoke Cloud Function using Cloud Function Invoker .
In the Type field, choose Executable Program .
Click Save .
Save the program as a Local Object .
In the ABAP Editor , add the following code:

Replace the following:
DEMO_CF : name of the client key that is used to access the Cloud Run function endpoint.
DEMO_CF_INVOKER : name of the client key that is used to invoke the Cloud Run function.
Run your application in SE38 . If successful, the following output displays:
HTTP Return Code: 200
Response: Hello Johnny! Full Name: John Doe
