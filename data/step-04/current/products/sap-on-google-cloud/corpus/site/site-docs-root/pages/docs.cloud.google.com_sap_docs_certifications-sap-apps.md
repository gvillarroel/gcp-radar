Memory-optimized machine types
The memory-optimized machine types that are certified for
SAP applications are optimized for memory-intensive workloads, such as
SAP HANA, in-memory analytics, and SQL analysis services.
X4 memory-optimized bare metal machine types
X4 is a series of memory-optimized machine types offered by
Compute Engine. They are designed to primarily support SAP workloads
that require up to 32 TB of memory.
The following restrictions apply:
Only Hyperdisk can be attached to an X4 instance. This applies
to the boot volume as well.
The X4 machine series is available in only select zones and regions .
X4 instances aren't supported with all operating system images. For information
about which operating system versions you can use with X4 instances, see
Operating system details .
The X4 machine series is only available as predefined machine types. Custom
machine shapes are not available.
For more information about the X4 machine series, see
X4 machine series .
The following table lists the X4 machine types that you can use to run SAP
workloads:
Note : From December 12, 2025, the naming convention for X4 machine types
has changed to clarify the memory they offer. For example, x4-megamem-960-metal has
changed to x4-960-16t-metal because it offers 16 TB of memory. While this naming
change is backwards compatible, we recommend that you use the updated names for new deployments.

Custom machine types
Custom machine types let you tailor the size of your
Compute Engine VM to your workload.
When you configure a custom VM instance, to ensure support from SAP, you must
conform to memory-to-vCPU ratios that are based on the machine type that
you are customizing and SAP guidelines.
You can customize only certain types of Compute Engine machines.
Each machine type has different rules for customizations. The following table
summarizes the rules for each custom machine type that SAP supports.
Machine type
vCPUs
Standard-memory option
High-memory option
N1
1, or any even number up to 96
3.75 GB or more per vCPU
6.5 GB or more per vCPU
N2
Any even number up to 32. After 32, the number of vCPUs must be
divisible by 4, up to 80 vCPUs. For example, 32, 36, and 40 vCPUs
are all valid, but 38 is invalid.
4.0 GB or more per vCPU
8.0 GB or more per vCPU
N2D
Must conform to Compute Engine N2D custom machine type rules up to a limit of 96 vCPUs.
4.0 GB or more per vCPU
8.0 GB or more per vCPU
Custom machine types need to be evaluated by SAP before SAP supports
them. Because the capacity (SAPS) of a custom machine configuration is not
predetermined, SAP cannot guarantee that a configured custom machine would
be suitable to run Business Suite workloads without first reviewing the
configuration.
Open an SAP support ticket against SAP component BC-OP-LNX-GOOGLE or
BC-OP-NT-GOOGLE to indicate your interest in a custom VM for an SAP
deployment. The SAP or Google platform team reviews your configuration to
confirm that it meets the SAP supportability requirements.

SAP Note 2456432 - SAP Applications on Google Cloud: Supported Products and
Google Cloud machine types
Creating a custom VM instance
Persistent disk storage for SAP applications
For persistent block storage, you can attach Persistent Disk and
Hyperdisk volumes to your Compute Engine VMs.
Compute Engine offers different types of Persistent Disk and
Hyperdisk. Each type has different performance characteristics.
Google Cloud manages the underlying hardware of these disks to ensure data
redundancy, and to optimize performance.
With SAP NetWeaver, you can use any of the following Persistent Disk or
Hyperdisk types:
Persistent Disk types : Standard ( pd-standard ), Balanced
( pd-balanced ), Performance or SSD ( pd-ssd ), and Extreme ( pd-extreme )
Standard Persistent Disk is backed by standard hard-disk drives (HDD).
Disks of this type are efficient and economical for handling sequential
read-write operations, but are not optimized to handle high rates of random
input-output operations per second (IOPS).
Balanced, Performance or SSD ( pd-ssd ), and Extreme Persistent Disk types
are backed by solid-state drives (SSD). These disk types provide
cost-effective and reliable block storage.
Performance (SSD) Persistent Disk provides higher performance than
Balanced Persistent Disk.
Balanced and Performance (SSD) Persistent Disk support PD Async Replication.
You can use this feature for cross-region active-passive disaster recovery.
For more information, see
PD Async Replication .
While you can use Extreme Persistent Disk ( pd-extreme ) with your SAP
applications, we recommend that you instead use Hyperdisk
volumes, which provide greater performance. For information about the
machine types that support using Extreme Persistent Disk, see
Machine shape support .
Hyperdisk types : Hyperdisk Balanced
( hyperdisk-balanced ) and Hyperdisk Extreme
( hyperdisk-extreme )
Hyperdisk Extreme provides higher maximum IOPS and throughput
options than Persistent Disk types.
For Hyperdisk Extreme, you select the performance you need by
provisioning IOPS, which also determines your throughput. For more
information, see
Size and performance limits for Hyperdisk Extreme .
For Hyperdisk Balanced, you select the performance you need
by provisioning IOPS and throughput. For more information, see
Size and performance limits for Hyperdisk Balanced .
For information about the machine types that support using
Hyperdisk, see
Machine type support .
For more information about persistent disk architecture and performance for
SAP NetWeaver, see Persistent disks .
For more information about the different types of block storage offered by
Compute Engine, their performance characteristics, and how to work with
them, see the Compute Engine documentation:
