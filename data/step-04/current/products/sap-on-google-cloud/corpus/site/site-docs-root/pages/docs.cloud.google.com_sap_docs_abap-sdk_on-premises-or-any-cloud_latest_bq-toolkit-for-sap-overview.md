The BigQuery Toolkit for SAP lets you programmatically
access BigQuery
resources within your SAP environment using ABAP .
You can access BigQuery
resources from SAP without having to write boilerplate code for common operations
such as the following:
Table definition synchronization : Keep your SAP and BigQuery
tables in sync.
Data type mapping : Map data types between SAP and BigQuery.
Data chunking : Efficiently transfer large datasets.
Error handling : Manage potential errors during data replication.
Unlike BigQuery Connector for SAP , which requires an SAP Landscape Transformation Replication Server , you can use
the BigQuery Toolkit for SAP within any SAP ERP system
where ABAP is supported.
The BigQuery Toolkit for SAP uses the BigQuery streaming API , which supports append-only operations for streaming data to
BigQuery.
The BigQuery Toolkit for SAP is shipped as a subpackage of the on-premises or any cloud edition of ABAP SDK for Google Cloud.
To use the toolkit, you need to install the SDK in your SAP environment. For information about
the installation steps, see Install and configure the on-premises or any cloud edition of ABAP SDK for Google Cloud .
The BigQuery Toolkit for SAP is only available with the on-premises or any cloud edition of ABAP SDK for Google Cloud.
Data replication from SAP to BigQuery
The BigQuery Data Transfer
module of the BigQuery Toolkit for SAP lets you replicate data from SAP
to BigQuery for analysis and reporting.
The following diagram shows the data transfer
configurations and data replication flow in the
BigQuery Data Transfer module:
Data transfer configurations
As shown in the diagram in the previous section, to establish data replication
from SAP to BigQuery, administrators
perform the following configurations:
In Google Cloud, the cloud administrator configures
BigQuery and grants necessary IAM permissions.
In the SAP system, the SAP system administrator configures
ABAP SDK for Google Cloud to allow communication with Google Cloud.
In the SAP system, the SAP system administrator configures the
BigQuery Data Transfer module to manage the data transfer
settings and BigQuery resource details. These configurations
are stored in the following tables:
/GOOG/BQTR_MASTER
/GOOG/BQTR_TABLE
/GOOG/BQTR_FIELD
/GOOG/BQTR_PARAMS
When the ABAP code runs, the BigQuery data load class reads
the configurations from these tables to guide the data replication process.
Data replication flow
As shown in the diagram in the previous section, to replicate data from SAP
systems to BigQuery, ABAP developers
write custom ABAP code that does the following:
Reads data from standard or custom SAP tables.
Uses the BigQuery data load class /GOOG/CL_BQTR_DATA_LOAD to
replicate selected data to BigQuery. This class:
Uses the configuration stored in BigQuery Data Transfer configuration tables.
Uses the /GOOG/CL_BIGQUERY_V2 class to perform table definition sync and data replication.
Implements follow-on business logic.
Handles errors and exceptions.
Supported sources for data replication
You can use the BigQuery Data Transfer module of the
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP to programmatically load data from
ABAP dictionary objects such as tables, dictionary views, CDS views, CDS entities,
or from any data objects with a flat structure
type into BigQuery.
You can use the BigQuery Toolkit for SAP for data replication in the following ways:
As a plug-in within SAP enhancement frameworks such as Business Add-Ins (BAdIs),
user exits, and routines. For example, the toolkit can be plugged into
Business Warehouse (BW) routines to send the data being processed by
BW Data Transfer Process (DTP).
For batch loading data from a custom ABAP program.
Performance planning
The BigQuery Toolkit for SAP provides the final stage of the transmission
of data to BigQuery by making synchronous calls to
the BigQuery streaming API .
When you use the BigQuery Toolkit for SAP within your custom ABAP
application, you can optimize the performance of data replication
both within your SAP workload and through the
BigQuery Data Transfer configurations.
Performance tuning options with your SAP workload and custom application
To optimize the performance of your SAP workload and custom applications,
consider the following options:
Run your SAP workload, the source system from which data is
replicated to BigQuery, on Google Cloud.
If your SAP workload is on Google Cloud, create your
BigQuery dataset in the same region as your SAP workload.
If you cannot run your SAP workload on Google Cloud, then do the following:
Create your BigQuery dataset in a Google Cloud
region that is closest to your SAP workload.
Connect to Google Cloud by using Cloud Interconnect.
Size your SAP server system optimally for your workload.
Implement parallel processing
to call the BigQuery Data Transfer module in multiple
parallel threads to increase throughput.
Because BigQuery Toolkit for SAP provides the final stage of the transmission
of data to BigQuery, its performance is influenced by various
factors within your specific environment. These factors can include the following:
Network infrastructure : Bandwidth limitations, latency, and overall network
stability play a significant role in replication speed and efficiency.
Source systems : The performance of your source databases, including their hardware, configuration, and current load, can impact replication performance.
Data volume and change rate : The amount of data being replicated and the frequency of changes affect the time and resources required for replication.
Other components : Firewalls, security policies, load balancers, and other infrastructure elements can all contribute to the overall performance of data replication.
You're responsible for performance testing the BigQuery Toolkit for SAP
in your own environment. For optimal results, consider and optimize all
relevant components of your environment.
Performance tuning options available through the BigQuery Data Transfer configurations
The BigQuery Data Transfer configurations provide the following options
to control the replication performance:
Data transfer chunk size
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP sends data to BigQuery as
chunks of records. We recommend that you use the default chunk size
with BigQuery Toolkit for SAP, which is 10,000 records.
If the records in a source table contain very few fields or the fields contain
very small size data values, then you can use a larger chunk size up to the
maximum chunk size that BigQuery Toolkit for SAP allows, which is 50,000 records.
If the number of records in a given chunk resolves to a byte size that
exceeds the BigQuery limit on the byte size for HTTP
requests, you might receive either a quotaExceeded error
or an invalid error. This can happen if the records in a source table
contain a lot of fields or the fields contain a lot of data.
If you get an error related to chunk size, try reducing the chunk size that
is specified in the mass transfer configuration for that table.
Alternatively, you can enable dynamic chunk size for that table to automatically
adjust the chunk size. For more information, see Dynamic chunk size .
If you have not enabled dynamic chunk size, then for SAP source tables like
MSEG , ACDOCA , and MATDOC , which can have large records with a lot of
fields per record, you might need to specify a chunk size as low as 2,000.
You can specify a chunk size by running the /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS
transaction. The chunk size is specified in the Chunk Size
field on the Table Attributes screen.
Record compression
By default, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP improves replication performance
by compressing the records that it sends to BigQuery.
When record compression is enabled at table level, which is the default setting,
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP omits all fields that are empty in the source record
from the records that are sent to BigQuery. When the record
is inserted into BigQuery, the fields that were omitted
from the sent data, are initialized with null in the target table in
BigQuery.
However, if you need to replicate some empty fields with their initial values
to BigQuery while still using record compression at the table level,
then you can change the record compression setting for those specific fields.
As a result, the empty values in the specified fields are not omitted
from the sent data, and retain whatever value they are initialized
in the source table.
In your mass transfer configuration , you can control the record compression
behavior by using the
Send Uncompressed Flag setting available at the table level and field level.
The following table summarizes the record compression behavior
depending on the Send Uncompressed Flag setting:
Send Uncompressed Flag at table level
Send Uncompressed Flag at field level
Record compression behavior
Yes
No
All fields are sent as uncompressed.
Yes
Yes
All fields are sent as uncompressed.
No
Yes
Only the selected fields at the field level are sent as uncompressed.
No
No
All fields are sent as compressed.
When you send the uncompressed data replication, except for date fields
and timestamp fields, the empty
fields retain whatever value they were initialized with in the source
table. The initialized value for date and timestamp fields receive
the following values:
Date field initialization value: DATE 1970-01-01
Timestamp field initialization value: TIMESTAMP 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC
The following screenshot shows an example of the record compression behavior:
The preceding image shows the following:
Row #1 : All fields are uncompressed. The Send Uncompressed Flag is
selected at table level.
Row #2 : All fields are compressed. The Send Uncompressed Flag is
clear at table level.
Row #3 : The following fields are uncompressed: int2_value ,
curr_value_154 , currency , float_value , and lang_value . For these fields,
Send Uncompressed Flag is selected at field level.
For better performance, we recommend that you don't disable record compression
by selecting Send Uncompressed Flag at the table level. It can have a
negative impact on replication performance. If you need to send uncompressed data
for only specific fields, then select Send Uncompressed Flag for those
specific fields at the field level.
Target table properties
When you configure replication in the BigQuery Data Transfer
module of BigQuery Toolkit for SAP, you can specify
settings that apply when BigQuery Toolkit for SAP creates the
target table in BigQuery.
For example, you can specify the following properties for a target
BigQuery table:
Table name
The default naming option for fields
Extra fields to capture record changes and to enable record count queries
Table partitioning
Default naming options for fields
You can configure BigQuery Toolkit for SAP to create the names for
the fields in the target BigQuery table either from the
names of the source fields or the labels and descriptions of the source
fields. The labels and descriptions are usually more informative about
the contents of the field.
By default, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP uses the names of the source fields.
You can change the default by specifying the Custom Names flag when
you specify in table creation attributes in the mass transfer
configuration of the /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS transaction. This specification
is stored in the /GOOG/BQTR_MASTR configuration table.
When creating the names, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP modifies them to conform
to the BigQuery naming convention.
Before the BigQuery Toolkit for SAP creates a table in BigQuery,
you can edit the field names in the field
mapping screen of the /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS transaction.
When the Custom Names flag is specified, the names that the
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP is going to use when it creates the
target table are shown in the External Field Name
column of the field mapping screen.
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP creates the names in the External Field Name
column from the medium field label of each source field. If a medium field
label is not specified in the source field definition, then the short
description for the field is used. If the short description isn't specified
either, then the shortest specified label is used. If nothing is specified,
then the name of the source field is used.
For more information about customizing target field names, see
Customizing target field names .
Capturing record changes and enabling record counts
To capture the type of change in the source table that triggered replication
and to be able to query record counts in the BigQuery table
for comparison with the record counts in the source
table, specify the Extra Fields Flag option in the
/GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS transaction when you're configuring replication.
When you specify the Extra Fields Flag option, the following columns
are added to the schema for the target BigQuery table:
Field name
Data type
Description
operation_flag
STRING
Identifies the type of change in the source table that triggered
the load or replication of the record into BigQuery.
To count records that were inserted in replication mode, query
records that have a value of I ,
U , or D in the operation_flag
field. For an example query, see Query the number of records inserted in replication mode .
To count records that were inserted in initial load mode, query
records that have a value of L in the
operation_flag field. For an example query, see Query the count of records inserted in initial load mode .
is_deleted
BOOLEAN
When true , indicates that the source record was
deleted from the source table.
To count only records in a BigQuery table that
have not been deleted from the source table, use the
is_deleted field to exclude deleted source records.
For an example query, see Query the total count of records in a BigQuery table .
recordstamp
TIMESTAMP
The time when the BigQuery Toolkit for SAP sent the record to
BigQuery.
To count the number of unique records in a BigQuery
table, query only the most recently inserted instance of each record.
For an example query, see Query the total count of records in a BigQuery table .
The current setting of the Extra Fields Flag option is stored in
the /GOOG/BQTR_MASTR configuration table.
For more information about how to specify the Extra Fields Flag , see
Specify table creation and other general attributes .
The BigQuery Toolkit for SAP doesn't
automatically create primary key constraints in BigQuery based on
the source SAP table definition. The toolkit replicates data into staging tables,
which by design, don't include these constraints.
To maintain data integrity for reporting, you can
implement a Change Data Capture (CDC) pattern by using
BigQuery MERGE statements
to process records from the staging table into a target table that has
informational (non-enforced) primary keys defined in its schema.
Table partitioning
You can create BigQuery tables in one of the following ways:
Tables that are partitioned
by either a timestamp field in the source table, which creates a time-unit
column-partitioned table.
Tables that are partitioned by the time at which the records are
inserted into BigQuery, which creates an ingestion-time
partitioned table.
You enable partitioning by specifying a partition type in the Partition
Type field in the /GOOG/BQTR_TABLE when you configure the replication
properties.
The partition types that you can specify adjust the granularity of the
partitioning by hour, day, month, or year.
To use a timestamp from the source table for time-unit column partitioning,
specify the name of the source field in the Partition Field field.
To use a BigQuery insertion time for ingestion-time
partitioning, you can leave Partition Field blank. The BigQuery Toolkit for SAP
creates a field in the target table to store the insertion time.
Target field properties
By default, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP uses the field names and data
types in the SAP source table as the field names and data types in the
target BigQuery.
Optionally, before the target table is created, you can customize field names
or change the BigQuery data type.
Customizing target field names
Before a table is created, you can customize target field names.
If necessary, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP modifies the custom names
that you specify to conform to the BigQuery naming convention.
When you configure replication, you can view the field names in the field
mapping screen of the /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS transaction. The
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP stores your settings in the /GOOG/BQTR_FIELD
configuration table.
Before a table is created in BigQuery, you can specify a custom field name by
editing the generated name in the Temporary Field Name column of
the field mapping screen. If you delete a value and leave the
Temporary Field Name field blank, then BigQuery Toolkit for SAP
uses the name of the source field for the name of that target field.
After you make any edits to the Temporary Field Name column, when you click
Save , BigQuery Toolkit for SAP validates the value, applies
BigQuery naming conventions as necessary,
and saves the changes. You can validate a value without
saving it by pressing Enter on your keyboard.
For more information about setting the default naming method for the target
fields, see Default naming options for fields .
Use a spreadsheet or text file to edit the BigQuery field map
Optionally, before you create a target BigQuery table, you can
save the default data types, names, and descriptions of the target fields
to a spreadsheet or text file. This approach lets BigQuery
data engineers or administrators edit the values even if they don't
have access to your SAP server.
After the values are edited, you need to convert the file and its contents
to the comma-separated values (CSV) format. You can then apply the updates
to the mass transfer settings by uploading the CSV file by using the
custom transaction /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS .
To use a CSV file to edit the BigQuery field map, do the following:
Create a spreadsheet or text file with the default field mappings.
Edit the values in the spreadsheet or text file.
Convert the spreadsheet or text file to CSV format.
In the BigQuery Data Transfer: Settings Maintenance screen, upload the CSV file.
For more information about this process, see Edit the BigQuery field map in a CSV file .
The BigQuery naming convention for fields
The BigQuery naming convention uses only lowercase letters,
numbers, and underscores.
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP applies the BigQuery naming
conventions to any input value to be used for the name of a target field.
For example, if you enter FIELD-@#!*123 as a custom field name, then the
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP changes the name to field_123 .
For more information about the BigQuery naming convention
for fields, see Column names .
Data type mapping
By default, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP assigns data types to the target
BigQuery fields based on the SAP type kind or
the SAP data type of the source SAP field.
When you configure replication, you can view the data types in the field
mapping screen of the /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS transaction. The
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP stores your settings in the /GOOG/BQTR_FIELD
configuration table.
Before the BigQuery Toolkit for SAP creates a table in BigQuery,
you can change the default data type
specification to a different BigQuery data type in
the External Data Element column of
the field mapping screen.
Booleans and timestamps: To accurately reflect the data
types of booleans and timestamps in the target table, before the target
table is created, you need to manually change their target data types
to BOOLEAN and TIMESTAMP , respectively. For
more information, see Data types that require special handling .
Data types that require special handling
To ensure accuracy and compatibility with the target BigQuery
tables, several SAP data types require special handling or
conversion during the replication process.
While the BigQuery Toolkit for SAP automatically handles some of these
conversions for you, others require your attention and manual configuration.
You need to manually handle conversions for the following data types:
Booleans
For booleans, SAP uses the data type CHAR . By default, the
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP maps this data type to the STRING data type in the
target BigQuery table.
Consequently, when you configure replication for booleans by using
the /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS transaction, you must change the default data type
assignment for boolean fields from STRING to BOOLEAN in the
field mapping screen.
Timestamps
For timestamps, SAP uses the data types P (packed decimal) or DEC
(decimal). By default, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP maps these data types to
NUMERIC in the target BigQuery table.
Consequently, for timestamps, when you configure replication by using
the /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS transaction, you must change the default data type
assignment for timestamp fields from NUMERIC to TIMESTAMP or
TIMESTAMP (LONG) in the field mapping screen.
X SAP type kind
The X SAP type kind is a hexadecimal and is represented by the RAW ,
RAWSTRING , or LRAW SAP data types. By default, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP
maps these data types to STRING in the source BigQuery
table.
If you need a source field with the X SAP type kind to map to BYTES
instead, you must change the default data type assignment for the field
in the field mapping screen of the /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS transaction.
The X SAP type kind is also sometimes used in SAP to represent integers.
In this case, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP checks the data type of the
source field for one of the SAP data types for integers, INT1 , INT2 ,
INT4 , INT8 and assigns the INTEGER data type in the target
BigQuery table.
y SAP type kind
The y SAP type kind is a byte string and is represented by the RAW ,
RAWSTRING , or LRAW SAP data types. By default, BigQuery Toolkit for SAP
maps these data types to STRING in the source BigQuery
table.
If you need a source field with the y SAP type kind to map to BYTES
instead, you need to change the default data type assignment for the field
in the field mapping screen of the /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS transaction.
Default data type mapping
The following table shows the default data type conversion of the
BigQuery Toolkit for SAP:
SAP type kind
SAP data type
BigQuery data type
Notes
b (1 byte integer)
s (2 byte integer)
I (4 byte Integer)
8 (8 byte integer)
INT1
INT2
INT4
INT8
INTEGER
F (float)
FLTP
FLOAT
P (packed)
CURR
DEC
QUAN
NUMERIC
By default, the SAP type kind P is mapped to the
BigQuery data type NUMERIC and converted
to a number in the external format.
a (decimal floating number, 16 places)
DECFLOAT16
NUMERIC
e (decimal floating number, 16 places)
DECFLOAT34
NUMERIC
N (numeric)
NUMC
STRING
X (hexadecimal)
y (byte string)
RAW
RAWSTRING
LRAW
STRING
If the SAP type kind is X , but the data-type name covers
pattern 'INT*' ( INT1 , INT2 , INT4 ), a source data element is replaced
with a new data element TYPINT8 with TYPEKIND '8' , which is mapped
to the BigQuery data type INTEGER .
C (character)
g (character string)
? (csequence)
& (clike)
CHARSTRING
STRING
D (date)
DATS
DATE
T (time)
TIMS
TIME
Note: While BigQuery Toolkit for SAP maps LRAW fields to STRING by
default, the toolkit does not support replication for
tables where an LRAW column is part of the primary key. This is a standard
limitation inherited from SAP Embedded BW, which prohibits RAW and LRAW types
in key fields or indexes. For more information about RAW and LRAW data types
in SAP, see Defining Keys .
Community resources
To accelerate the implementation of BigQuery Toolkit-based
applications within SAP S/4HANA systems that use Embedded BW, you can use
the open-source generation tools available on GitHub .
