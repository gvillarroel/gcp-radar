Configure a Google Cloud identity provider
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
You can use Cloud Identity, Google Workspace, or a third-party identity
provider (such as Okta or Azure AD) to manage users, groups, and authentication.
This page describes how to use Cloud Identity or Google Workspace.
When using Cloud Identity or Google Workspace, you create managed user accounts
to control access to Google Cloud resources and to Google SecOps.
You create IAM policies that define which users and groups have access
to Google SecOps features. These IAM policies
are defined using predefined roles and permissions provided by Google SecOps
or custom roles that you create.
As part of linking a Google SecOps instance to Google Cloud
services, configure a connection to a Google Cloud IdP. The
Google SecOps instance integrates directly with Cloud Identity
or Google Workspace to authenticate users and enforce access control based on
your configured IAM policies.
See Identities for users
for detailed information about creating Cloud Identity or Google Workspace accounts.
Grant a role to enable sign-in to Google SecOps
The following steps describe how to grant a specific role using IAM
so that a user can sign in to Google SecOps. Perform the configuration using
the Google SecOps-bound Google Cloud project you created earlier.
Grant the Chronicle API Viewer ( roles/chronicle.viewer )
role to users or groups that should have access to the Google Security Operations application.
Note: The following examples use the gcloud command. To use
the Google Cloud console, see
Grant a single role . Important: The following examples don't configure authorization to
Google SecOps features. This is done using IAM for
feature access control.
The following example grants the Chronicle API Viewer role to to a specific group:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role roles/chronicle.viewer \
--member "group: GROUP_EMAIL "
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : with the project ID of the Google Security Operations-bound project
you configured in Configure a Google Cloud project for Google Security Operations .
See Creating and managing projects for a description of fields that identify a project.
GROUP_EMAIL : the email alias for the group, such as analyst-t1@example.com .
To grant the Chronicle API Viewer role to a specific user, run the following command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--role roles/chronicle.viewer \
--member "user: USER_EMAIL "
Replace USER_EMAIL : the user's user email address, such as alice@example.com .
For examples of how to grant roles to other members, such as a group or
domain, see
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding
and Principal identifiers reference
documentation.
Configure additional IAM policies to meet your
organization's access and security requirements.
Note: Custom IAM role mappings aren't supported for the SOAR side of the
Google SecOps platform.

enabling Google Security Operations audit logging .
If you are configuring for Google Security Operations, perform additional steps in
Provision, authenticate, and map users in Google Security Operations .
To configure access to features, perform additional steps in Configure feature access control using IAM and Google Security Operations permissions in IAM .
