Configure data RBAC for users
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
This page describes how data role-based access control ( data RBAC )
administrators can configure data RBAC within Google Security Operations. Through
the creation and assignment of data scopes, which are defined by labels,
you can ensure that data is only accessible to authorized users.
Data RBAC relies on IAM
concepts including predefined roles , custom roles ,
and IAM conditions .
The following is a high-level overview of the configuration process:
Plan your implementation: identify the different types of data you want
to restrict user access to. Identify the different roles within your
organization and determine the data access requirements for each role.
Optional: Create custom labels: create custom labels (in addition to the
default labels )
to categorize your data.
Create data scopes: define scopes by combining relevant labels.
Assign scopes to users: assign scopes to user roles in IAM
based on their responsibilities.
Enable data RBAC: enable data RBAC to apply the scope assignments.
You have the following two options to set up data RBAC:
Enable data RBAC before assigning scopes: when data RBAC is
enabled, rules, reference lists, and data tables don't
have any scopes assigned. Only users with global access have access to the
data. Scoped users don't have access to any data by default. This prevents
unintended access and ensures a secure starting point. To grant
access, define scopes and assign them to users, rules, and reference lists based
on your requirement.
Enable data RBAC after assigning scopes: setting up and assigning
scopes in advance provides immediate data access to users when data RBAC is
enabled. Additionally, since rules have scopes assigned, the generated
detections are tagged with scopes. This allows users to see detections that
were generated after the scope assignments.
Important: Before data RBAC is enabled, all users, regardless of assigned
scopes, have global access and can view all data.
Before you begin
To understand the core concepts of data RBAC, different access types, and the
corresponding user roles, the working of labels and scopes, and the impact of
data RBAC on Google SecOps features, see Overview of Data RBAC .
Onboard your Google SecOps instance. For more information, see Onboarding or migrating a Google Security Operations instance .
Make sure that you have the required roles .
Create and manage custom labels
Custom labels are metadata that you can add to the SIEM ingested
Google SecOps data to categorize and organize
it based on UDM-normalized values.
For example, consider you want to monitor network activity. You want to track
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) events from a specific IP address
(10.0.0.1) that you suspect might be compromised.
To filter and identify these specific events, you can create a custom label with
the name Suspicious DHCP Activity with the following query:
metadata.event_type = "NETWORK_DHCP" AND principal.ip = "10.0.0.1"
The custom label works in the following manner:
Google SecOps continuously ingests network logs and events into its
UDM. When a DHCP event is ingested, Google SecOps checks if it
matches the criteria of the custom label. If the metadata.event_type field is
NETWORK_DHCP and if the principal.ip field (the IP address of the device
requesting the DHCP lease) is 10.0.0.1 , Google SecOps applies the
custom label to the event.
You can use the Suspicious DHCP Activity label to create a scope and assign
the scope to the relevant users. The scope assignment lets you restrict access
to these events to specific users or roles within your organization.
Custom Label requirements and limitations
We recommend that you review the following limits and requirements when you define and use custom labels:
Naming and syntax requirements
Custom Label names must be unique and can have a maximum length of 63 characters.
The name can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, and hyphens.
A deleted label name cannot be reused after deletion.
Functional limitations
Custom Label query don't support the following advanced features:
Reference lists
Enrichment fields
Data tables
Query execution time : Custom label query is subject to a maximum execution time limit of 5 seconds.
Create custom label
To create a custom label, do the following:
Log in to Google SecOps .
Click Settings > SIEM Settings > Data Access .
On the Custom labels tab, click Create custom label .
In the UDM Search window, type your query and click Run Search .
You can refine the query and click Run Search until the results display
the data that you want to label. For more information about running a query,
see Enter a UDM Search .
Click Create label .
On the Create label window, select Save as new label , and enter the
label name and description.
Click Create label .
A new custom label is created. During data ingestion, this label is applied
to data that matches the UDM query. The label is not applied to data that is
already ingested.
Modify custom label
You can only modify the label description and the query associated with a label.
Label names cannot be updated. When you modify a custom label, the changes are
applied only to new data and not to the data that is already ingested.
To modify a label, do the following:
Log in to Google SecOps .
Click Settings > SIEM Settings > Data Access .
On the Custom labels tab, click more_vert
Menu against the label that you want to edit and select Edit .
In the UDM Search window, update your query and click Run Search .
You can refine the query and click Run Search until the results display
the data that you want to label. For more information about running a query,
see Enter a UDM Search .
Click Save changes .
The custom label is modified.
Delete custom label
Deleting a label prevents new data from being associated with it. Data that is
already associated with the label remains associated with the label. After
deletion, you can't recover the custom label or reuse the label name to create
new labels.
Click Settings > SIEM Settings > Data Access .
In the Custom labels tab, click the more_vert
Menu for the label that you want to delete and select Delete .
Click Delete .
On the confirmation window, click Confirm .
The custom label is deleted.
View custom label
To view a custom label details, do the following:
Click Settings > SIEM Settings > Data Access .
In the Custom labels tab, click more_vert
Menu against the label that you want to edit and select View .
The label details are displayed.
Create and manage scopes
You can create and manage data scopes within the Google SecOps user
interface, and then assign those scopes to users or groups through IAM.
You can create a scope by applying labels that define the data that a user
with the scope has access to.
Create scopes
To create a scope, do the following:
Log in to Google SecOps .
Click Settings > SIEM Settings > Data Access .
On the Scopes tab, click Create scope .
In the Create new scope window, do the following:
Enter Scope name and Description .
In Define scope access with labels > Allow access , do the following:
To select the labels and their corresponding values that you want to
grant users the access to, click Allow certain labels .
In a scope definition, labels of the same type (for example, log type)
are combined using the OR operator, while labels of different types
(for example, log type and namespace) are combined using the AND
operator. For more information about how labels define data access in
scopes, see Data visibility with allow and deny labels .
To give access to all data, select Allow access to everything .
To exclude access to some labels, select Exclude certain labels , then
select the label type and the corresponding values that you want to deny
users the access to.
When multiple deny access labels are applied within a scope, access is
denied if they match any of those labels.
Click Test scope to verify how the labels are applied to the scope.
In the UDM Search window, type your query and click Run Search .
You can refine the query and click Run Search until the results display
the data that you want to label. For more information about running a query,
see Enter a UDM Search .
Click Create scope .
In the Create scope window, confirm the scope name and description
and click Create scope .
The scope is created. You must assign the scope to users to give them access to
the data in the scope.
Modify scope
You can only modify scope description and the associated labels. Scope names
cannot be updated. After you update a scope, the users associated with the scope
are restricted as per the new labels. The rules that are bound to the scope are
not re-matched against the updated one.
To modify a scope, do the following:
Log in to Google SecOps .
Click Settings > SIEM Settings > Data Access .
On the Scopes tab, click more_vert
Menu corresponding to the scope that you want to edit and select Edit .
Click edit Edit to edit the scope
description.
In the Define scope access with labels section, update the labels and
their corresponding values as required.
Click Test scope to verify how the new labels are applied to the scope.
In the UDM Search window, type your query and click Run Search .
You can refine the query and click Run Search until the results display
the data that you want to label. For more information about running a query,
see Enter a UDM Search .
Click Save changes .
The scope is modified.
Delete scope
When a scope is deleted, users don't have access to the data associated with
the scope. After deletion, the scope name cannot be reused to create new scopes.
To delete a scope, do the following:
Log in to Google SecOps .
Click Settings > SIEM Settings > Data Access .
On the Scopes tab, click more_vert
Menu against the scope that you want to delete.
Click Delete .
Note: After you delete a scope, you can't reuse the scope name.
In the confirmation window, click Confirm .
The scope is deleted.
View scope
To view scope details, do the following:
Log in to Google SecOps .
Click Settings > Data Access .
In the Scopes tab, click more_vert
Menu against the scope that you want to view and select View .
The scope details are displayed.
Assign scope to users
Scope assignment is required for controlling data access for users with
restricted permissions. Assigning specific scopes to users determines the data
that they can view and interact with. When a user is assigned multiple scopes,
they gain access to the combined data from all those scopes. You can assign the
appropriate scopes to users who require global access so that the users can view
and interact with all the data. To assign scopes to a user, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Select the project that is bound to Google SecOps.
Click person_add Grant access .
In the New principals field, do the following:
If you're using Workforce Identity Federation or any other third party
authentication, add your principal identifier
as follows:
principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/ POOL_ID /subject/ USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS
Replace the following:
POOL_ID : the identifier for the pool created for
your identity provider.
USER_EMAIL : the user's email address.
If you're using Cloud Identity or Google Workspace,
add your principal identifier
as follows:
user: USER_EMAIL
Replace the following:
USER_EMAIL : the user's email address.
In the Assign roles > Select a role menu, select the required role.
Click Add another role to add multiple roles. To understand which roles need
to be added, see User roles .
To assign a scope to the user, add conditions to the Chronicle Restricted
Data Access role that is assigned to the user (does not apply to global access
roles).
Note: When assigning a scope to a group, make sure that the group has at least
one member. A scope assigned to an empty group doesn't apply to any users. Members
of groups without assigned scopes can sign in to Google SecOps but
can't access data until they belong to a scoped group.
Click Add IAM condition against the
Chronicle Restricted Data Access role. The Add condition window appears.
Enter the condition title and the optional description.
Add the condition expression.
You can add a condition expression using either the Condition builder
or the Condition editor .
The condition builder provides an interactive interface to select the
condition type, operator, and other applicable details about the expression.
The following operators let you create precise rules for controlling
access to multiple scopes with a single IAM condition:
ENDS_WITH : checks if the scope name ends with a specific word. To match
the exact word, add a / before the word.
Consider an example data access scope named projects/1234/locations/us/instances/2342-434-44-3434-343434/dataAccessScopes/scopename .
ENDS_WITH /scopename matches the exact name and evaluates as true for the example scope.
ENDS_WITH scopename matches any name that ends with "scopename" and is evaluated as true for the example scope and also for projects/1234/locations/us/instances/2342-434-44-3434-343434/dataAccessScopes/testscopename .
STARTS_WITH : checks if the scope name starts with a specific word. For
example, STARTS_WITH projects/project1 grants access to all the scopes
within "project1".
EQUALS_TO : checks if the name exactly matches a specific word or phrase.
This gives access to only one scope. For example,
EQUALS_TO projects/1234/locations/us/instances/2342-434-44-3434-343434/dataAccessScopes/scopename evaluates as true for the example scope.
To add scopes to the role, we recommend the following:
Select Name in Condition type , the operator in Operator ,
and enter the scope name in Value .
/<scopename>
To assign multiple scopes, add more conditions using the OR operator.
You can add up to 12 conditions for each role binding. To add more than 12
conditions, create multiple role bindings and add up to 12 conditions to
each of these bindings.
For more information about conditions, see Overview of IAM conditions .
Click Save .
The condition editor provides a text-based interface to manually enter an
expression using CEL syntax .
Enter the following expression:
(scope-name: resource.name.endsWith(' /SCOPENAME1 ') || resource.name.endsWith(' /SCOPENAME2 ') || … || resource.name.endsWith(' /SCOPENAME '))
Replace /SCOPENAME1 , /SCOPENAME2 , and other placeholders with the
scope names that you want to assign to the principle.
Click Run Linter to validate the CEL syntax.
Click Save .
Note: Conditional role bindings don't override role bindings with no
conditions. If a principal is bound to a role, and the role binding does
not have a condition, then the principal always has that role. Adding
the principal to a conditional binding for the same role has no effect.
Click Test changes to see how your changes affect the user access to
the data.
Click Save .
The users can now access the data that is associated with the scopes.
Enable data RBAC
Enabling data RBAC applies all assigned scopes to rules and
reference lists, making sure users see only the data relevant to their scopes. To
enable data RBAC, do the following:
Log in to Google SecOps .
Click Settings > SIEM Settings > Data Access .
Navigate to the Assignments tab and review the scope assignments of the
rules and reference lists. To find specific items, use the filter or search
functionalities.
Click Enforce data access . The Enforce data access window displays the
number of rules and reference lists that will be scoped
after data RBAC is enforced.
Click Yes, Enforce .
