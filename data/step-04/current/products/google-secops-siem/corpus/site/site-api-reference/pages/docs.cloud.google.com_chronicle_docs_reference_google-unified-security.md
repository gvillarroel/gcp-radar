Google Unified Security
Google Unified Security is our new AI-powered converged security solution,
designed to address the challenges of fragmented data and siloed security tools of
which threat actors are increasingly taking advantage. By integrating Google's
leading threat intelligence, security operations, cloud security, secure enterprise browsing,
and Mandiant expertise, Google Unified Security creates a scalable
security solution running on a planet-scale security fabric to secure your organization.
Real-time insights from Gemini AI enhances threat
detection and streamlines security operations, empowering
organizations to shift from reactive to preemptive security and stay two steps ahead of increasingly sophisticated attackers
The key components of Google Unified Security are:
Modern Security Operations : Detect, investigate, and respond to threats at Google speed and scale
Threat intelligence and exposure management : Know who is targeting you
and where you are exposed.
Comprehensive Google Cloud protection and AI security : Reduce cloud risk and secure your
cloud and AI workloads, anywhere.
Secure Enterprise browser : Protect your corporate data on any device.
Incident response and expert assistance :
World class Mandiant incident experts are by your side.
Agentic AI Triage and Investigation : Automatic triage and investigation of security alerts.
Five Main Solutions Enabled by GUS
The following solutions harness the power of the Google Unified Security suite of products.
Strengthening Endpoint Security: Integrated protection with Google Chrome Enterprise Premium & Google SecOps
Chrome Enterprise Premium (CEP) integration with Google SecOps provides
critical visibility into threats originating from browser activity to strengthen
your endpoint security posture. The browser has become a common point of entry
for a wide range of threats, including malware, phishing attacks, credential theft,
and data exfiltration. As many business applications are accessed primarily with a browser,
it is essential to respond to these threats before attackers can gain access to critical data.
This integration unlocks new security operations workflows, enabling analysts
to more effectively manage browser-based risks from Google SecOps.
New curated detections : specifically designed for Chrome threats and enriched with
Safe Browsing and Google Threat Intelligence (GTI), allow for the identification of threats
that might be missed by other security controls.
Improved visibility : Security analysts gain better visibility through dedicated Google SecOps
dashboards that provide key insights into Chrome security events and anomalies to facilitate investigation.
Automated response :Leveraging native playbook orchestration capabilities, security teams can also
automate response actions on Chrome Enterprise, such as blocking malicious URLs,
blocking extensions, and even quarantining devices,
directly from the Google SecOps platform.
Simplified Onboarding : With just a few clicks, enable recommended security defaults and a direct integration of Chrome data.
This centralized approach, enhanced by Google Threat Intelligence enrichment, empowers security teams to
achieve faster detection, conduct more informed investigations, and more efficiently remediate web-based threats.
Getting Started with Google Chrome and Google SecOps
Configure the Chrome Enterprise Premium Reporting Connector to send data to Google SecOps
Connect Chrome Enterprise Premium to Google SecOps
Enable Chrome Enterprise Threats Curated Detections
Examples
Investigating Malicious Browser Extensions
A user downloads and installs a malicious browser extension from outside the Chrome Web Store, that once installed, reads their session cookies and posts them to a server on a suspicious domain that was registered within the last week. Using browser extension telemetry a security analyst can determine how many users have installed this extension and take remediation actions to remove it from their devices.
What browser activities are present on Unmanaged or Bring-Your-Own Devices (BYOD)
An employee working remotely on their personal laptop, accesses company resources through the Chrome browser to work on a project. Chrome Enterprise policies can enforce policies on how the employee can use the data from business applications. Attempts to bypass these policies such as attempting to upload/download files can be monitored to ensure sensitive data isn’t stored on the unmanaged device.
Suspicious user activities occurring within your environment
A security analyst receives an alert that a user has suddenly initiated a large data transfer to an external cloud storage service after several failed login attempts, raising suspicion of a potential account compromise or unauthorized data transfer. By analyzing the user behavior trends, the analyst can validate whether this employee typically only traditionally accesses these files during standard business hours and their account was compromised.
Measure effectiveness of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies
An administrator can measure the effectiveness of DLP rules by reviewing aggregate data to ensure that “block” and “warn” policies applied through Chrome are addressing threats and not preventing legitimate work.
Streamline SOC Operations with Security Command Center and Google SecOps
Google Unified Security includes Google Security Command Center Enterprise with the latest AI Protection suite.
Google SecOps provides Cloud Detection Investigation and Response (CDIR),
Case Management, SIEM log searching and investigation, Cloud Asset Inventory collection
for Entity Graph Enrichment, and the ability to automate common SOC workflows
using the SOAR component of Google SecOps.
With the unified capabilities between Google SecOps and Security Command Center,
SOC analysts and Cloud Security engineers have a single converged platform within which to view and respond to incidents and cases related to threats in their Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS platforms.
Since both SIEM and SOAR capabilities are front and center within the platform,
there's no need anymore to send Cloud log data and related threat events outside of the platform -
everything is included under the umbrella heading of Google Unified Security.
In order to enable the full complement of CDIR features, certain logs need to be ingested
into Google SecOps, some directly from Google Cloud, and for multi-cloud capability,
from AWS and Azure.
Getting Started with Security Command Center and Google SecOps
Activate the Enterprise Tier of SCC-E using your existing Google SecOps instance.
See activate enterprise tier
Validate Security Command Center Detection Services are enabled: See How to configure Security Command Center
Connect Security Command Center to AWS to get configuration and resource data that flows through to the Entity Graph:

(Optional) Integrate Security Command Center with ticketing systems. See Integrate ticketing system
Map users to the Google SecOps platform. See Map users
Enable the response playbooks. See Install playbooks
Ingest the Google Cloud logs into Google SecOps using direct ingestion:
See Ingest Google Cloud logs
Set up the Google Cloud Export Filter.
Ingest the AWS logs into SecOpsGoogle SecOps: See Ingest AWS logs .
Ingest Azure logs into Google SecOps: See Ingest Azure logs
Configure optional services, See Advanced Configuration
Enable the CDIR Curated Detections. See Curated Detections
Examples
CDIR : An analyst receives a high priority CDIR SCC Enhanced Privilege Escalation alert (one of many driven
by Cloud Threat Curated Detections ) that
gets automatically mapped to a Google SecOps case. They see the behavior within the alert corresponds
to a service account that is over-privileged, and is allowing an adversary to move laterally through a cloud environment,
access new systems, and escalate to higher privileges in order to carry out malicious actions.
The analyst can review the behavior and react by adjusting the account permissions or disabling the account.
SIEM Log Searching and Investigation : During a CDIR investigation, or on an ad-hoc basis,
analysts can use either natural language syntax, Yara-L syntax, or raw log searching
to surface information in various logs ingested into Google SecOps related to cloud infrastructure and services.
This allows for the verification of potential adversary behavior to rule out false positives or prove a true positive.
Common log sources used during these kinds of investigations include (but are not limited to) Google Cloud audit logs, AWS CloudTrail logs and GuardDuty events, and Azure AD activity logs.
Cloud Asset Inventory Collection : Once the various connectors between Google SecOps and Security Command Center are established,
asset inventory information about multi-cloud environments regularly flows into the Google SecOps Entity Graph.
From there, SOC analysts and other users of the system see immediate additional context, driven by this inventory,
to speed analysis and help prioritize workflow. For example, an enriched alert concerning an AWS S3 bucket
may contain additional information about the bucket such as the region, the owner, and metadata tags surrounding
the bucket even if that information wasn’t present in the source alert.

Future-Proof Your Defenses: Proactive Threat Hunting with Integrated GTI in Google SecOps
Integrating Google Threat Intelligence (GTI) directly within Google SecOps
transforms threat detection and response from reactive to proactive through the
Applied Threat Intelligence (ATI) feature.
ATI continuously analyzes your security telemetry against high-fidelity
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) curated by GTI. By applying this frontline intelligence
directly within Google SecOps, security teams gain unparalleled
visibility and context, ensuring that security events are actively interpreted
through the lens of the latest, validated threat intelligence to help you stay ahead of
novel and sophisticated attacks. This integration leverages Google SecOps
curated detections to evaluate event data against GTI IOCs, automatically generating
prioritized alerts (such as Active Breach or High )
to ensure focus on critical threats.
Key Benefits
Intelligence-Driven Detection: Leverage Google SecOps curated
detections that evaluate your event data against Mandiant IOCs. Automatically
generate alerts when matches are found for IOCs labeled Active Breach or High ,
ensuring focus on critical threats.
Enhanced Investigation Context: Accelerate investigations using the
dedicated IOC Matches page in Google SecOps.
Gain immediate context around suspicious entities (domains, IPs, hashes, URLs)
including GCTI Priority , IC-Score , threat actor/malware Associations ,
and related Campaigns , all without pivoting to external tools.
Prioritized Alerts: Benefit from intelligence-driven alert prioritization
based on Mandiant insights (e.g., Active IR, Prevalence, Attribution, Commodity status).
Focus response efforts on alerts classified as Active Breach, High, or Medium based on contextualized IOC matches.
Proactive Threat Hunting: Utilize GTI feeds and insights within Google SecOps search and detection rules (YARA-L) to proactively hunt for emerging threats and specific attacker TTPs within your environment.
Integration points between Google Threat Intelligence and Google SecOps
Continuous IOC Matching : Google SecOps automatically ingests
and evaluates GTI-curated IOCs against your normalized security data (UDM).
Curated Detections & Prioritization : Pre-built detection rules
(available in rule packs like "Applied Threat Intelligence - Curated Prioritization")
contextualize IOC matches using event data and Mandiant intelligence features to
generate prioritized alerts (Active Breach, High, Medium, Inbound IP Auth).
Native Threat Feeds : Natively
integrated threat intelligence feeds from Mandiant, VirusTotal, SafeBrowsing, and more,
enable users to create their own custom detections and scoring methodologies.
Centralized Investigation: The IOC Matches page serves as the central
hub for viewing matched IOCs, filtering results (by Type, Priority, Status, Source: Mandiant, etc.),
and drilling down into event details, UDM context, threat intelligence rationale,
and associations.
Getting Started
Enable Curated Detections: Activate the Applied Threat Intelligence curated detections rule packs within Google SecOps to enable alerting and prioritization.
Explore IOC Matches: Familiarize yourself with investigating alerts using the IOC Matches page.
Learn more about how GCTI Priority is determined by clicking on any event from a prioritized IOC Match in IOC Matches pages
Examples
Investigating a High Priority Alert: An analyst investigates an Active Breach priority alert on the IOC Matches page. They see the matched IOC is a domain associated with a known phishing campaign (visible in Associations/Campaigns) with a high IC-Score. Reviewing the event details confirms outbound traffic from a user workstation. The analyst uses this context to trigger a SOAR playbook to isolate the machine and reset user credentials.
Proactive Hunting & Validation: Following a Mandiant report on a new malware variant, an analyst uses the provided IOCs (hashes, C2 domains) in Google SecOps SIEM Search. They also check the IOC Matches page, filtering by the relevant malware association or campaign name, to confirm if ATI has already detected related activity in their environment.
