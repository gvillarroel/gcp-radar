Cases overview
Supported in:
Google secops
SOAR
Google Security Operations ingests alerts from a wide range of sources. Each
alert includes its underlying security events and key indicators (such as
sources, destinations, artifacts), which are parsed and analyzed. During this
analysis, key indicators—such as source and destination IPs, file hashes, or
user accounts—are extracted and represented as entities.
Entities are persistent objects in the platform. They collect enrichment data,
analyst comments, and historical context, letting analysts track entity
behavior over time and across cases. Entities also appear on the visual
canvas to help illustrate relationships in the threat landscape.
Case creation and grouping
The Cases page is where analysts can investigate incoming alerts and
manage incident workflows. Analysts can also:
Automatically group additional alerts into existing cases based on shared
entities and configurable rules.
Manually create cases or simulate cases for testing and training purposes.
Case queue header and views
All active cases from various connectors appear in the case queue. Each case
entry shows key metadata, such as:
Case name and unique ID
Case timestamp
Number of associated alerts
Assigned analyst (with avatar)
Case priority and stage (optional, depending on view)
Analysts can toggle between these views:
Default view : Shows case cards with essential information.
Compact view : Reduces visual footprint for faster scanning.
List view : Displays all cases in a table format for bulk operations or filtering.
Case top bar
The Case Top Bar displays case-level context and available actions,
as follows:
The case queue header displays the case title, ID, priority, stage , timestamp, change environment, and tags .
It also shows the assigned analyst (name or role), and includes controls for Chat , Close Case , Refresh , Explore , and the Case Actions menu.
For details see What's on the Cases page?
Case tab
Each case includes several tabs that help analysts review, investigate, and act on case data. These tabs organize key information—from high-level summaries to detailed logs and alert data—into a consistent, navigable format.
Case overview tab
The Case Overview tab displays case-specific widgets configured by the administrator. For details see Explore the Case Overview tab .
Case Wall tab
The Case Wall tab displays a chronological log of all case-related
events and actions, from creation to closure. When you open this tab, you can
view case-related information such as tasks, user comments, pinned chat
messages, manual and system actions, and file attachments (up to 50 MB per file).
Each type of content is represented by an icon in the upper section of the
Case Wall.
Actions you can do with this tab:
Click View More to display both the standard UI results and the corresponding JSON data.
To view event details, click one or more of the event icons.
To view events for all alerts in the case, select All Alerts .

Alert Overview tab: Lists all alerts linked to the case, including associated events and metadata.
This tab displays crucial information and events associated with the case.
The case queue—automatically refreshed every minute—lists all active cases
and lets you manually refresh, sort, filter, add, or close cases as needed.
Playbook automation
Playbooks are predefined sets of actions that collect information
from internal and external alert sources. They then make decisions on how to
handle these alerts or perform operations on remote systems, such as blocking
a firewall port or disabling an Active Directory user.
Google SecOps performs these actions automatically or semi-automatically
based on the playbook triggers on any alert ingestion.
