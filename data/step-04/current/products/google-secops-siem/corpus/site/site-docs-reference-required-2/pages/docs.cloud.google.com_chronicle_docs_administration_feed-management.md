Use the Feed Management UI
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
This document explains how to create, troubleshoot, and manage feeds within the Feed Management UI,
including instructions for modifying, enabling, and deleting them.
Before you begin
Each data feed requires specific prerequisites before setup in Google Security Operations. To find the requirements for your feed, see Configuration by source type and search for your specific data source.
Supported compression formats and file sizes
Supported compression formats for feed ingestion include .gz, .tar.gz, .tar, and solr.gz.

Log line limits and delimiters
When ingesting text-based logs (JSON, CSV, or Syslog), ensure your data adheres
to these specific ingestion limits:
Maximum Line Size : A single log line cannot exceed 4MB . If a single
line exceeds this limit, the feed fails with the error
MaxLogLineSize4MBExceeded .
Supported Delimiters : Both Newline ( \n ) and Carriage Return + Newline
( \r\n ) are supported.
Note: For log types with high data density, verify that your log source is not
grouping multiple events into a single line that exceeds the 4 MB limit. If you
encounter size errors, you may need to adjust the source logging configuration
to ensure individual entries are properly delimited.
Impact of changing your linked Cloud Project on data feeds
If you are updating the Google Cloud project associated with your Google SecOps instance, all feeds ingesting data using the following connectors will stop, and must be re-created manually:
AMAZON_S3_V2
AMAZON_SQS_V2
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_V2
AZURE_BLOBSTORE_V2
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_EVENT_DRIVEN
For all other feeds that are not utilizing these connectors, ingestion continues without any interruption. No action needs to be taken by customers.
What to expect during migration
For impacted feeds, you will observe the following changes:
Feed Status : Feeds created prior to the migration will immediately stop pulling live data and will become read-only.
Existing Data : Any data that was already transferred to Google SecOps before the migration will be ingested automatically; no data will be lost.
Error Messages : If you attempt to edit or delete an older feed, you will receive a message stating: This feed is read-only because this SecOps has now moved to a new Google Cloud Project (BYOP). To continue ingesting data from this source, please create a new feed .
Required actions for customers
To ensure continuous data ingestion, you must manually re-create your feeds in the new environment. Follow these steps to minimize disruption:
Re-create Feeds : You must create new feeds to replace the ones that existed pre-migration.
Configure Max File Age : When setting up your new feeds, set the Max File Age to around 2 hours before the BYOP update was initiated. This time buffer ensures a smooth transition.
Manage Duplicate Data : Depending on the Max File Age you select, you may experience some duplicate data transfer.
Note: This does not apply to feeds where the Delete after Transfer option is enabled.
Record and delete existing feeds (before migration) : Before you begin the
BYOP migration, record the configuration settings for all existing feeds that
use the impacted connectors (for example, Amazon S3 V2),
and then delete the feeds. If you don't delete feeds created before migration,
they become unmanageable and remain in the Google SecOps web
interface as orphaned settings.
Ways to set up feeds
There are two ways for Google SecOps customers to set up this feed in the platform. Use the method that works best for your environment:
SIEM Settings > Feeds (standard)
Content Hub > Content Packs (premium)
Note: If you're using the SIEM standalone platform, you won't have access to the Content Hub. Contact your Google SecOps representative to upgrade.
Configure your feeds
This section describes how to generally configure your feeds, starting with the standard procedural flow. The data feeds listed on the Feeds page include all the feeds that Google has configured for your account, including the feeds that you configured.
Add a feed
Caution: As of April 15, 2026 , the v1 connector framework for Google
Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, and Azure Blob Storage is deprecated. We
recommend using the v2 connector framework, which uses the
Google Cloud Storage Transfer Service (STS) for near real-time ingestion. For more
information, see Feature Deprecations .
To add a feed to your Google SecOps account, complete the following steps:
In the Google SecOps menu, select SIEM Settings > Feeds .
Click Add New Feed .
On the next page, click Configure a single feed . Note: This step is not relevant for customers who use the Google SecOps SIEM standalone platform.
Add a feed name.
In the Source type list, select the source type for importing data into Google SecOps.
You can select from the following feed source types:
Amazon Data Firehose
Amazon S3 (Deprecated)
Amazon S3 (V2)
Amazon SQS (Deprecated)
Amazon SQS (V2)
Azure Blob Storage (Deprecated)
Azure Blob Storage (V2)
Google Cloud Pub/Sub
Cloud Storage (Deprecated)
Cloud Storage (V2)
Cloud Storage Event Driven
Third party API
Webhook
Important:
When using Amazon S3 (Deprecated), Amazon SQS (Deprecated), Azure Blob Storage (Deprecated), and Google Cloud Cloud Storage (Deprecated) feeds, make sure that you have a valid directory path.
When using Amazon SQS (Deprecated) or Amazon SQS (V2), explicitly grant Google SecOps permissions to delete messages from the Amazon SQS queue.
When using Amazon SQS (Deprecated) feeds, make sure only one feed consumes messages from the queue. Messages read by another application or feed don't get ingested into the current feed.
Using Amazon SQS (Deprecated) as the feed source type is only supported for logs in Amazon S3 buckets.
In the Log type list, select the log type that corresponds to the logs you want to ingest. The available logs vary depending on the source type you selected earlier.
Note: For the AWS CLOUDTRAIL log type, verify that the logs are in JSON format and the filename is a JSON file (uncompressed) or a JSON GZipped file (compressed).
If you select Cloud Storage as the source type, use the Get service account
option to get a unique service account. See Google Cloud Storage feed setup example .
Click Next .
Specify the parameters needed from the Input Parameters tab. The options presented here vary depending on the source and log type selected on the Set Properties tab.
Hold the pointer over the question icon for each field to get additional information on what you need to provide.
Optional: You can specify a namespace in the Set Properties tab.
For more information about namespaces, see Work with asset namespaces .
Click Next .
Review your new feed configuration on the Finalize tab.
Click Submit . Google SecOps completes a validation check of the new feed. If the feed passes the check, a name is generated for the feed, it's submitted to Google SecOps, and Google SecOps begins to attempt to fetch data.
Configure multiple feeds for a product family (Google SecOps customers only)
You can configure multiple feeds per product family, based on log type.
Baseline log types : Marked as required . These log types are essential for core platform functionality.
Supplementary log types : Marked as optional . These log types provide additional context.
To simplify the setup, the platform provides specific setup instructions and predefined parameters for each configuration.
For example, for CrowdStrike Falcon, you can create multiple unique feeds under both required and optional log types to make sure there's enough comprehensive data coverage.
Configure the feed for CrowdStrike EDR
Follow these steps to configure a log feed for CrowdStrike EDR.
From Settings > Feeds , click Add New Feed
Click the CrowdStrike Falcon product:.
Select CrowdStrike EDR log type.
Alternatively, from Content Hub > Content Packs , click the CrowdStrike Falcon product:
Click Get Started .
Select CrowdStrike EDR log type.
Specify values for the following fields:
Field
Description
Source Type
Amazon SQS
Region
The AWS S3 region associated with the URI.
Queue Name
The SQS queue name to read from.
Account Number
The SQS account number.
Source Deletion Option
Indicates whether to delete files and directories after the transfer.
Queue Access Key ID
A 20-character alphanumeric access key for the account, such as AKIAOSFOODNN7EXAMPLE .
Queue Secret Access Key
A 40-character alphanumeric secret access key for the account, such as, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY .
Optional: Configure the following parameters:
Feed Name: prepopulated unique name for the feed.
Asset namespace: namespace associated with the feed.
Ingestion labels: labels applied to the events from this feed.
Click Create Feed .
You can repeat this process to create additional feeds for the same log type. You can also configure feeds for other available log types directly from this page. When finished, go to the Feed Management page to view a detailed summary of all configured log types.
IP allowlisting
Enable allowlisting and add the Google IP ranges for all log types that ingest data from third-party APIs.
Delete source files
The source deletion option lets you delete feed source objects (files and
folders) from storage, after a successful transfer. This option is only
available for selected feed source types, including
Cloud Storage. These feed source types include the SOURCE DELETION OPTION
field in their Add new and Edit feed workflows.
Note: When you configure the SOURCE DELETION OPTION field, if you select an
option to delete source objects, you must enable the required deletion
permissions for that feed type. For information about permissions, see
Configuration by source type .
Source deletion options
For supported feed source types, including Cloud Storage, the SOURCE DELETION
OPTION field offers these options:
Never delete files
Delete transferred files and empty directories
Delete transferred files
Microsoft Azure Blob Storage (AZURE_BLOBSTORE) doesn't support deletion of
source files. For the SOURCE DELETION OPTION field, only select
the Never delete files option.
For the following feed sources ( "feedSourceType" ):
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_V2 , GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_EVENT_DRIVEN ,
AMAZON_S3_V2 , AMAZON_SQS_V2 , and AZURE_BLOBSTORE_V2 , the
SOURCE DELETION OPTION field offers two options:
NEVER : Never deletes any files after transfers.
ON_SUCCESS : Deletes all files and empty directories after transfer.
Source-specific setup and permissions
Different source types require specific authentication and networking configurations to communicate with Google SecOps. This section describes how to configure permissions, set up service accounts, and establish secure connections for your specific data source. The setup outlined focuses on Cloud Storage ingestion (pull based), multi-cloud ingestion (cross-cloud pull), and push-based ingestion (API or real-time).
Google Cloud Storage feed setup example
Note: If you use the Domain Restricted Sharing organization policy in Google Cloud, make sure you add the Google SecOps customer ID C02h8e9nw to the allowlist.
From the Google SecOps menu, select Settings , and then click Feeds .
Click Add New Feed .
On the next page, click Configure a single feed . This step doesn't apply if you are using the Google SecOps SIEM standalone platform.
Select Cloud Storage v2 for Source Type .
Select the Log type . For example, to create a feed for Google Kubernetes Engine
audit logs, select Google Kubernetes Engine audit logs as the Log Type .
Click Get service account . Google SecOps provides a unique service account
that Google SecOps uses to ingest data.
Optional: Configure the service account. For more information, see
Grant access to the Google SecOps service account .
Click Next .
Based on the Cloud Storage configuration that you created, specify values for the following fields:
Storage bucket URI
Note: Use a wildcard to match an entire directory name. For example, gs://cs-myprod/*/more-data is valid (where * replaces the entire name of a single directory level). Note: For Cloud Storage Event Driven feed types, set up a Pub/Sub subscription for Cloud Storage, as described in Configure Pub/Sub .
Source deletion option
To learn more about how to set up Cloud Storage buckets, see
Create Buckets .
Note: Cloud Storage bucket feeds don't work with empty folder names.
Click Next and then click Submit .
Grant access to the Google SecOps service account
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage Buckets page.
Go to Buckets
Grant access to the service account to the relevant Cloud Storage objects.
To grant read permission to a specific file , complete the following steps:
Select the file and click Edit access .
Click Add principal .
In the New principals field, enter the name of the Google SecOps service account.
Assign a role that contains the read permission to the Google SecOps service account. For example, Storage Object Viewer
( roles/storage.objectViewer ).
This can only be done if you've not enabled uniform bucket-level access .
Click Save .
To grant read permission to multiple files , grant access at the bucket level as follows:
For "feedSourceType": "GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE" :
Add the Google SecOps service account as a principal to your
storage bucket and grant it the IAM Storage Object
Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer ) role.
If you configure the feed to delete source files, you must add the
Google SecOps service account as a principal on your bucket and
grant it the IAM Storage Object Admin
( roles/storage.objectAdmin ) role.
For "feedSourceType": "GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_V2" , grant a role from both step a and step b :
Grant either of these roles:
Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer ) if the transfer is to another Cloud Storage bucket.
Storage Object Creator ( roles/storage.objectCreator ) if the transfer is to a file system.
Grant either of these roles:
Storage Legacy Bucket Writer ( roles/storage.legacyBucketWriter ) if object delete permission is required.
Storage Legacy Bucket Reader ( roles/storage.legacyBucketReader ) if object delete permission is not required.
For "feedSourceType": "GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_EVENT_DRIVEN" :
Grant either of these roles:
Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer ) if the transfer is to another Cloud Storage bucket.
Storage Object Creator ( roles/storage.objectCreator ) if the transfer is to a file system.
Grant either of these roles:
Storage Legacy Bucket Writer ( roles/storage.legacyBucketWriter ) if object delete permission is required.
Storage Legacy Bucket Reader ( roles/storage.legacyBucketReader ) if object delete permission is not required.
Configure VPC Service Controls
If VPC Service Controls is enabled, both ingress and egress rules are required to provide access to the Cloud Storage bucket.
Ingress rules
The following Cloud Storage methods must be allowed in the ingress rule:
google.storage.objects.list : Required for a single file feed.
google.storage.objects.get : Required for feeds that require directory or subdirectory access.
google.storage.objects.delete : Required for feeds that require deletion of the source file.
Sample ingress rule
- ingressFrom:
identities:
- serviceAccount:8911409095528497-0-account@partnercontent.gserviceaccount.com
sources:
- accessLevel: "*"
ingressTo:
operations:
- serviceName: storage.googleapis.com
methodSelectors:
- method: google.storage.objects.list
- method: google.storage.objects.get
- method: google.storage.objects.delete
resources:

Enable STS access for Amazon S3 and Azure Storage
The STS is used by the following Google Cloud Storage
feeds to transfer data from Amazon S3 and Azure Storage blobstores to
Google SecOps:
Amazon S3 (V2)
Amazon SQS (V2)
Azure Blob Storage (V2)
STS sends data transfer requests to the Amazon S3 and Azure storage services
from a set of defined STS IP address ranges. These STS IP address ranges are
published in the following JSON file:
IP ranges
To use these STS feed source types, you may need to adjust IP access restrictions to enable STS to access your
Amazon S3 and Azure storage services:
Pull the latest IP ranges from the JSON file.
We recommend reading data from this JSON file at least weekly to keep your
security configuration up to date. When a new range is added to the file, the
system waits at least 7 days before using that range for requests from STS.
For a sample Python script that fetches IP ranges from a JSON file, see IP addresses for default domains .
Compare the current IP range creationTime to the IP range creationTime
read from the previous JSON file. If these differ, update the IP access
restrictions in Amazon S3 and Azure Storage blobstores.
For Amazon S3
To update the IP access restrictions in your Amazon S3 blobstore:
If your AWS project uses IP restrictions for access to storage, you must add
the IP ranges used by STS workers to your list of allowed IPs.
Note: If you're using agents instead of an agentless transfer, add your agent
machine IP address(es) to your list of allowed IPs instead.
To add these ranges as allowed IPs, use the Condition field in a bucket policy , as described in the AWS S3 documentation: Managing access based on specific IP addresses .
For Azure Storage
To update the IP access restrictions in your Azure Storage blobstore:
If you restrict access to your Azure resources using an Azure Storage
firewall, you must add the IP ranges used by STS workers to your list of
allowed IPs.
To add these ranges as allowed IPs, follow these instructions: Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks .
Set up a Pub/Sub push feed
To set up a Pub/Sub push feed, do the following:
Create a Pub/Sub push feed.
Specify the endpoint URL in a Pub/Sub subscription.
Note: The Pub/Sub push feed needs to be in your Google Cloud project bound to
Google SecOps for the subscription to authenticate. It uses a JWT token
from your service account for authentication. For more details, see
Authentication for push subscriptions .
Create a Pub/Sub push feed
In the Google SecOps menu, select Settings , and then click Feeds .
Click Add new .
In the Feed name field, enter a name for the feed.

Create a push subscription in Pub/Sub. For more information about how to create
a push subscription, see Create push subscriptions .
Specify the endpoint URL, which is available in the Google Cloud Pub/Sub push feed.
Select Enable authentication , and select a service account.
Note: If you need to push logs from an another Google Cloud project that isn't
bound to Google SecOps, such as from a user-managed service account, you must set up a log sink.
For more information about log sinks, see Route logs to supported destinations .
Set up an Amazon Data Firehose feed
To set up an Amazon Data Firehose feed, do the following:
Create an Amazon Data Firehose feed and copy the endpoint URL and secret key.

Click Generate Secret Key to generate a secret key to authenticate this feed.
Copy and store the secret key as you cannot view this secret again. You can generate
a new secret key again, but regeneration of the secret key makes
the previous secret key obsolete.
On the Details tab, copy the feed endpoint URL from the Endpoint Information field.
You need this endpoint URL when you specify the destination settings for your
delivery stream in Amazon Data Firehose.
Optional: Click the Feed Enabled toggle to disable the feed. The feed is
enabled by default.
Click Done .
Create an API key for the Amazon Data Firehose feed
To create an API key for the Amazon Data Firehose feed, do the following:
Go to the Google Cloud console Credentials page.
Click Create credentials and select API key .
Restrict the API key access to the Chronicle API.
Specify the endpoint URL
In Amazon Data Firehose, specify the HTTPS endpoint and access key, as follows:
Append the API key to the feed endpoint URL and specify
this URL as the HTTP endpoint URL in the following format:
ENDPOINT_URL ?key= API_KEY
Replace the following:
ENDPOINT_URL : the feed endpoint URL.
API_KEY : the API key to authenticate to Google SecOps.
For the access key, specify the secret key that you obtained when you created
the Amazon Data Firehose feed.
Set up an HTTPS webhook feed
Before you begin:
Ensure that a Google Cloud project for Google SecOps is configured
and the Chronicle API is enabled for the project.
Link a Google SecOps instance to Google Cloud services .
Note: Batches of data sent through Webhook feeds may
experience ingestion delays if the request size or QPS limits are
set too low. The HTTPS push endpoint supports a maximum request size
of 4 MB per request and a maximum throughput of 15 K QPS per Google SecOps
instance.
To set up an HTTPS webhook feed, do the following:
Create an HTTPS webhook feed and copy the endpoint URL and secret key.
Create an API key that is specified with the endpoint URL. You can also
reuse your existing API key to authenticate to Google SecOps.
Specify the endpoint URL in your application.
Send multiple events in a single webhook request
The following code sample shows how to format a single request body with multiple, newline-separated JSON objects after the curl --location item:
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-goog-api-key: API_KEY' \
--header 'X-Webhook-Access-Key: SECRET' \
--data '{"principal": {"asset_id": "asset 123"}, "metadata": {"event_type": "GENERIC_EVENT", "product_name": "Product Acme"}}
{"principal": {"asset_id": "asset 123"}, "metadata": {"event_type": "GENERIC_EVENT", "product_name": "Product Acme"}}'
Create an HTTPS webhook feed
In the Google SecOps menu, select Settings , and then click Feeds .

Asset namespace : the asset namespace .
Ingestion labels : the label to be applied to the events from this feed.
Click Next .
Review your new feed configuration in the Finalize screen, and then click Submit .
Click Generate Secret Key to generate a secret key to authenticate this feed.
Copy and store the secret key as you cannot view this secret again. You can generate
a new secret key again, but regeneration of the secret key makes
the previous secret key obsolete.
From the Details tab, copy the feed endpoint URL from the Endpoint Information field.
You need to specify this endpoint URL in your client application.
Optional: Click the Feed Enabled toggle to disable the feed. The feed is enabled by default.
Click Done .
Create an API key for the webhook feed
Go to the Google Cloud console Credentials page.
Click Create credentials , and then select API key .
Restrict the API key access to the Chronicle API.
Specify the endpoint URL
In your client application, specify the HTTPS endpoint, which is available in the webhook feed.
Enable authentication by specifying the API key and secret key as part of the custom header
in the following format:
X-goog-api-key = API_KEY
X-Webhook-Access-Key = SECRET
We recommend that you specify the API key as a header instead of specifying it
in the URL. If your webhook client doesn't support custom headers, you can specify
the API key and secret key by using query parameters in the following format:
ENDPOINT_URL ?key= API_KEY &secret= SECRET
Replace the following:
ENDPOINT_URL : the feed endpoint URL.
API_KEY : the API key to authenticate to Google SecOps.
SECRET : the secret key that you generated to authenticate the feed.
Manage feeds
After you configure your data feeds, use the management tools to monitor ingestion health, modify existing parameters, and manage the feed lifecycle. This section outlines how to interpret feed statuses and perform essential maintenance tasks to ensure continuous data visibility.
The Feeds page provides several tools to help you navigate and organize your
list of configured feeds:
Search: Use the search bar to find a feed by its Feed Name , Feed ID ,
or Source type .
Filter: Click the filter icon to narrow the list based on specific feed
attributes.
Download CSV: Click Download as CSV to export the current list of feeds to
a CSV file.
Pagination: Use the pagination controls to:
Change the number of Rows per page .
Navigate through multiple pages of feeds using the page tabs and arrows.
Last refreshed time: View the timestamp to see when the feed list was last
updated.
View configured feeds
The Feeds page shows all the feeds you've configured.
Go to SIEM Settings > Feeds . The main page displays all
your configured feeds.
Hold the pointer over each row to display the
more_vert
More menu.
In the menu, you can view feed details, edit, disable, or delete the feed.
Monitor the feed status
You can monitor the status of the feed on the initial Feeds page, where feeds can have the following statuses:
Active : Feed is configured and ready to ingest data into your Google SecOps account.
InProgress : Google SecOps attempts to pull data from the configured third party.
Completed : Data successfully retrieved by this feed.
Archived : Disabled feed.
Failed : Feed is failing to successfully fetch data. This is likely due to a configuration issue. Click the question to display the configuration error. Once you've corrected the error and resubmitted the feed, return to the Feeds page to determine whether or not the feed is now working.
Note: The Last succeeded on column on the Feeds page shows the last time
data was fetched successfully by that feed. For a new feed, this field is blank.
Push feeds, like Webhook and Google Cloud pubsub don't populate this column.
These push feeds don't have a schedule, meaning the data comes in when it is pushed.
Edit existing feeds
On the Feeds page, you can edit an existing feed, as follows:
Hold the pointer over an existing feed and click
more_vert in the right column.
Click Edit Feed . You can now modify the input parameters for the feed and
resubmit it to Google SecOps, which will attempt to use the updated feed.
Note: Existing feeds show [Not Configured] as a feed name on the Feeds page. Edit the feed to add a feed name.
Enable and disable feeds
In the Status column, enabled feeds are labeled as Active , InProgress , Completed , or Failed . Disabled fields are labeled as Archived . For a description, see the feed status .

Note: When you delete a feed, no new data will be ingested. There may be data
already in the queue that will still be processed.
Control the rate of ingestion
When the data ingestion rate for a tenant reaches a certain threshold,
Google Security Operations restricts the rate of ingestion for new data feeds to prevent
a source with a high ingestion rate from affecting the ingestion rate of another
data source. In this case, there is a delay but no data is lost. The ingestion
volume and tenant's usage history determine the threshold.
You can request a rate limit increase by contacting
Cloud Customer Care .
