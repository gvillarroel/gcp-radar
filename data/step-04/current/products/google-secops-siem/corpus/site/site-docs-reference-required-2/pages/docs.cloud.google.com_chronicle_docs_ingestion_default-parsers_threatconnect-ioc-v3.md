Collect ThreatConnect IOC logs using the v3 API
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
The ThreatConnect feed in Google Security Operations lets you automatically fetch
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, domains, URLs, and file hashes, along with their
context (for example, threat type, confidence score, tags) from your
ThreatConnect account. Ingesting these IOCs enriches your security data in
Google Security Operations, enhancing threat detection and investigation
capabilities.
This document describes how to configure Google SecOps to ingest
IOCs from your ThreatConnect instance using the
ThreatConnect v3 API connector. This version of the connector utilizes the
ThreatConnect
v3 REST API , and is an
updated version of the existing connector
that uses the ThreatConnect v2 REST API.
Before you begin
Ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
An active ThreatConnect instance and user account with sufficient permissions
to access the required indicators using the v3 API. This typically involves
permissions to read indicators and their attributes
A Google Security Operations instance
Sufficient Identity and Access Management permissions in your Google Cloud project to manage
Google SecOps feeds
Configuration Steps
Follow these steps to set up the ThreatConnect IOC feed:
Obtain ThreatConnect v3 API Credentials
Log in to your ThreatConnect instance.
Go to the API user management section to create a new API user or use an
existing one designated for your Google SecOps integration.
To create a new API user:
Go to Settings > Org Settings .
Go to the Membership tab in the Organization Settings page.
Click Create API User .
Fill out the fields on the API User Administration window:
First Name : enter the API user's first name.
Last Name : enter the API user's last name.
System Role : select the Api User or Exchange Admin System
role.
Note: API users with the Api User role can use all ThreatConnect
v2 and v3 API endpoints except for the v3 API TC Exchange™
administration endpoints, while the Exchange Admin role grants
access to all v2 and v3 endpoints.
Organization Role : select the API user's Organization role.
Include in Observations and False Positives : select the checkbox
to allow data provided by the API user to be included in counts.
Disabled : click the checkbox to disable an API user's account in
the event that the Administrator wants to retain log integrity.
Copy and securely store the Access ID and Secret Key .
Click Save .
Retrieve the Access ID and Secret Key for the relevant API user, and proceed
to the next step.
Configure the ThreatConnect feed in Google Security Operations
Go to SIEM Settings > Feeds .
Click Add New Feed .
On the next page, click Configure a single feed .
In the Feed name field, enter a name for the feed (for example,
ThreatConnect Logs ).
For Source Type , select Third-party API .
For Log Type , select ThreatConnect IOC V3 .
Click Next .
Enter the following details for the ThreatConnect v3 API:
Username : enter the ThreatConnect Access ID obtained in Step 1.
Secret : enter the ThreatConnect Secret Key obtained in Step 1.
API Hostname : your ThreatConnect instance's FQDN (for example:
<myinstance>.threatconnect.com ).
Owners : Specify the ThreatConnect Organization, Community, or Source
to pull indicators from. Enter one owner per line. For more information, see
the
Owners Overview .
TQL : The required TQL query to fetch IoCs based on your ingestion
requirements (see How to write TQL Queries ).
Fields : Names of additional fields to fetch, that are not fetched by
default. Enter one field per line
(see List of default and additional fields ).
Click Next .
Review the feed configuration in the Finalize screen, and then click
Submit .
Validate ingestion
After submitting the configuration, allow some time for the initial data
pull.
Check the feed status in the Feeds list. The status should eventually
show as Completed or Active .
Verify that data is being ingested by querying logs in the
Google Security Operations search page:
Use the query: log_type = "THREATCONNECT_IOC_V3"
Examine the ingested logs to ensure fields are parsed as expected.
How to write TQL Queries
In ThreatConnect, you can build structured queries with a SQL-like query
language called ThreatConnect Query Language (TQL) to perform highly targeted
searches of your data. A TQL query includes a parameter name, an operator, and a
value or list of values, and you can combine multiple queries with parentheses
and AND/OR logic.
The following example TQL query searches for high-confidence network indicators
(IPs, Hosts, URLs) added in the last 30 days that are associated with Cobalt
Strike, APTs, or Phishing. It also explicitly filters out known false positives
and internal test data.
typeName IN ( "Address" , "Host" , "URL" )
AND confidence > 75
AND dateAdded > "NOW() - 30 DAYS"
AND ( summary CONTAINS "cobalt" OR tag STARTSWITH "APT" OR tag ENDSWITH "Phish" )
AND NOT tag = "False_Positive"
AND source != "Internal_Testing"
For more information on TQL, see the ThreatConnect TQL documentation .
List of default and additional fields
This section details the specific data points retrieved from the ThreatConnect
API, categorized by whether they are included by default or require manual
configuration.

Additional fields
When retrieving data, you can use the Fields input field to include
additional fields that are not included in the list of Default Fields.
To include one or more additional fields in the API response, populate the field
value in separate lines in the Field input box while setting up your feed.
For example, to include data for associated Groups and Tags in an API response,
type in associatedGroups in line 1, press Enter , and then enter tags in
line 2.
For more information about Indicator Attributes, see Indicators Overview .
For more information about Additional Fields, see
Include Additional Fields in API Responses .
Troubleshoot common issues
Authentication Failed : Double-check the API Host, Access ID, and Secret
Key. Ensure the API user has the correct permissions for the v3 API and is not
locked. Verify there are no network firewalls blocking
Google SecOps' access to your ThreatConnect API host.
No Data Ingested :
Confirm the filters you set (e.g., confidence, tags, types) match indicators
available in your ThreatConnect instance.
Check the ThreatConnect API user's permissions.
Check the latest feed status in the Google SecOps UI for
error messages.
API Rate Limits : ThreatConnect may enforce API rate limits. The connector
should handle standard rate limits, but excessive fetching could cause delays.
Check ThreatConnect API documentation for limit details.
Data Parsing Issues : If logs are ingested but not parsed correctly, compare
the raw log from Google SecOps with the expected JSON output from
the ThreatConnect v3 API for indicators. Contact Google Cloud support if
you suspect a parser issue.
Migrate from the v2 Connector
If you were using the previous ThreatConnect feed based on the v2 API, consider
the following:
Key differences : The v3 API might have a different data structure, different
filtering parameters, or new capabilities. Review the ThreatConnect v3 API
documentation to understand changes relevant to the indicators you are
ingesting.
Setup v3 feed : Configure the new feed (as described above) using your v3 API
credentials. You can run both the v2 and v3 feeds simultaneously for a
transition period.
Validate data : Compare the data ingested by the v3 feed with the data from
the old v2 feed to ensure completeness and correctness. Note any field changes
or improvements.
Disable old feed : Once you are confident the v3 feed is working as expected,
you can disable or delete the old feed configuration that uses the v2 API to
avoid duplicate data and reduce API calls.
