Quotas and limits
This page describes the request quotas and limits for Firestore with MongoDB compatibility.
Free tier usage
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility offers a free tier that lets you get started with
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility at no cost. The free tier amounts are listed in the following
table.
Free tier amounts are applied daily and reset at midnight Pacific time.
The free tier applies to only one Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database per project.
The first database that is created in a project without a free tier database
will get the free tier. If the database with the free tier applied is deleted,
the next database created will receive the free tier.
