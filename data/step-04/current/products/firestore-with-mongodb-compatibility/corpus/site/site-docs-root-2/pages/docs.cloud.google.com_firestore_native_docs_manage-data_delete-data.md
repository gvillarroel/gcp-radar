import { doc , deleteDoc } from "firebase/firestore" ;
await deleteDoc ( doc ( db , "cities" , "DC" )); delete_document . js
Web version 8
Use the delete() method:
db . collection ( "cities" ). doc ( "DC" ). delete (). then (() = > {
console . log ( "Document successfully deleted!" );
}). catch (( error ) = > {
console . error ( "Error removing document: " , error );
}); test . firestore . js
Swift
Use the delete() method:

} else {
NSLog ( @"Document successfully removed!" );
}
}]; ViewController . m

await cityRef . DeleteAsync (); Program . cs
Ruby
Use the delete() method:
city_ref = firestore . doc " #{ collection_path } /DC"
city_ref . delete delete_data . rb
Warning: Deleting a document does not delete its subcollections!
When you delete a document, Firestore does not automatically
delete the documents within its
subcollections. You can still access the subcollection documents by reference.
For example, you can access the document at path
/mycoll/mydoc/mysubcoll/mysubdoc even
if you delete the parent document at /mycoll/mydoc .
Non-existent parent documents appear in the console ,
but they don't appear in query results and snapshots.
If you want to delete a document and all the documents within its
subcollections, you must do so manually. For more information, see
Delete Collections .
Delete fields
To delete specific fields from a document, use the following language-specific FieldValue.delete() methods
when you update a document:
Web version 9
Use the deleteField() method:
import { doc , updateDoc , deleteField } from "firebase/firestore" ;
const cityRef = doc ( db , 'cities' , 'BJ' );
// Remove the 'capital' field from the document
await updateDoc ( cityRef , {
capital : deleteField ()
}); update_delete_field . js
Web version 8
Use the FieldValue.delete() method:
var cityRef = db . collection ( 'cities' ). doc ( 'BJ' );
// Remove the 'capital' field from the document
var removeCapital = cityRef . update ({
capital : firebase . firestore . FieldValue . delete ()
}); test . firestore . js
Swift
Use the FieldValue.delete() method:
Note: This product is not available on watchOS and App Clip targets.
do {
try await db . collection ( "cities" ). document ( "BJ" ). updateData ([
"capital" : FieldValue . delete (),
])
print ( "Document successfully updated" )
} catch {
print ( "Error updating document: \( error ) " )
} ViewController . swift
Objective-C
Use the fieldValueForDelete: method:
Note: This product is not available on watchOS and App Clip targets.
[[[ self . db collectionWithPath : @"cities" ] documentWithPath : @"BJ" ] updateData : @{
@"capital" : [ FIRFieldValue fieldValueForDelete ]
} completion :^ ( NSError * _Nullable error ) {
if ( error != nil ) {
NSLog ( @"Error updating document: %@" , error );
} else {
NSLog ( @"Document successfully updated" );
}
}]; ViewController . m
Kotlin Android
Use the FieldValue.delete() method:
val docRef = db . collection ( "cities" ). document ( "BJ" )
// Remove the 'capital' field from the document
val updates = hashMapOf<String , Any > (
"capital" to FieldValue . delete (),
)
docRef . update ( updates ). addOnCompleteListener { } DocSnippets . kt
Java Android
Use the FieldValue.delete() method:
DocumentReference docRef = db . collection ( "cities" ). document ( "BJ" );
// Remove the 'capital' field from the document
Map<String , Object > updates = new HashMap <> ();
updates . put ( "capital" , FieldValue . delete ());
docRef . update ( updates ). addOnCompleteListener ( new OnCompleteListener<Void> () {
// ...
// ... DocSnippets.java

final docRef = db . collection ( "cities" ). doc ( "BJ" );
// Remove the 'capital' field from the document
final updates = < String , dynamic > {
"capital" : FieldValue . delete (),
};
docRef . update ( updates ); firestore . dart
Java
Use the FieldValue.delete() method:
DocumentReference docRef = db . collection ( "cities" ). document ( "BJ" );
Map<String , Object > updates = new HashMap <> ();

{
Path : "capital" ,
Value : firestore . Delete ,
},
})
if err != nil {
// Handle any errors in an appropriate way, such as returning them.
log . Printf ( "An error has occurred: %s" , err )
}
// ...
return err
}

city_ref = firestore . doc " #{ collection_path } /BJ"
city_ref . update ({ capital : firestore . field_delete }) delete_data . rb
Delete collections
To delete an entire collection or subcollection in Firestore,
retrieve (read) all the documents within the collection or subcollection and delete
them. This process incurs both read and delete costs. If you have larger
collections, you may want to delete the documents in smaller batches to avoid
out-of-memory errors. Repeat the process until you've deleted the entire
collection or subcollection.
Deleting a collection requires coordinating an unbounded number of
individual delete requests. If you need to delete entire collections, do so only
from a trusted server environment. While it is possible to delete a collection
from a mobile/web client, doing so has negative security and performance implications.
The following snippets are simplified for clarity and don't include error
handling, security, deleting subcollections, or performance optimizations. To learn more
about one recommended approach to deleting collections in production, see
Deleting Collections and Subcollections .

Delete data with TTL policies
A TTL policy designates a given field as the expiration time for documents in a
given collection group. TTL delete operations count towards your document delete
costs.
For information about setting TTL, see Manage data retention with TTL policies .
Bulk deletion jobs
Firestore supports several tools for bulk deletion. You should
select a tool based on the number of documents you need to delete and the
level of configurability you need.
Note: Deleting a large number of documents can impact latency .
If latency is caused by too many recent deletes, the issue should automatically
resolve after some time. If the issue does not resolve,
contact support .
For smaller jobs
of thousands of documents, use the console or the Firebase CLI. For larger
jobs, these tools might start to timeout and require you to run the tool multiple
times.
Console
You can delete documents and collections from the
Firestore page in the console . Deleting a document from the
console deletes all of the nested data in that document, including any
subcollections.
Firebase CLI
You can also use the Firebase CLI
to delete documents and collections. Use the following command to delete
data:
Note: Deleting data with the Firebase CLI incurs read and delete costs.
For more information, see Pricing .
firebase firestore:delete --database= DATABASE_ID PATH
Replace DATABASE_ID with your database ID and PATH with a path to a document or collection.
For large deletion jobs (millions of documents), use one of the following:
Managed bulk delete
Firestore supports bulk deleting one or more collection groups.
For more information, see Bulk delete data .
Dataflow connector
You can use Dataflow
for bulk operations on your database. This option is the most configurable,
but also requires more set up than other bulk delete options.
See the Firestore connector for
Dataflow introduction
blog post
has an example of deleting all documents in a collection group.
