Indexes overview
This page describes indexing for Firestore with MongoDB compatibility.
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility does not create any indexes by default. To improve database
performance, create indexes for your most commonly used queries.
Indexes have a large impact on the performance of a database. If an index exists
for a query, the database can efficiently return results by reducing the amount
of data that needs to be scanned and reducing the work needed to sort the
results. However, index entries increase storage costs and the amount of work
done during a write operation on indexed fields.
Index definition and structure
An index consists of the following:
a collection ID
a list of fields in the given collection
an order, either ascending or descending, for each field
An index can also enable the sparse , multikey , or unique options.
Index ordering
The order and sort direction of each field uniquely defines the index. For
example, the following indexes are two distinct indexes and not
interchangeable:
Collection
Fields
cities
country (ascending), population (descending)
cities
population (descending), country (ascending),
When creating an index to support a query, include the fields in the same order
as your query.
Index density
By default, index entries store data from all documents in a collection. This is
known as a non-sparse index. An index entry will be added for a document regardless
of whether the document contains any of the fields specified in the index.
Non-existent fields are treated as having a NULL value when generating index
entries. To change this behavior, you can define the index as a sparse index.
Sparse indexes
A sparse index indexes only the documents in the
collection that contain a value (including null) for at least one of the indexed
fields. A sparse index reduces storage costs and can improve performance.
Multikey indexes for array values
If you are creating an index on a field that contains array values, you must
create a multikey index. A regular index cannot
index array values. A multikey index supports up to one array field in the
index definition and can be used for operations that traverse array values.
Only use multikey indexes if you know that you need to index array values.
Regular indexes have advantages when processing a query. For example, regular
indexes can filter values within a range more efficiently.
The following situations lead to errors when working with array values and
multikey indexes:
An operation attempts to add an array value to a field indexed by a
regular index. To add the array value, you must delete existing regular
indexes on that field, and recreate them as multikey indexes.
You attempt to create a regular index on a field that contains an array
value. You must either create a multikey index or delete the array values.
An operation attempts to index multiple fields with array values. You
cannot have more than one field with an array value in a multikey index.
To proceed, modify your data model or your index definitions.
You attempt to create a multikey index where two field paths share a common
prefix like users.posts and users.zip .
Unique indexes
Set the unique index option to enforce unique values for the indexed fields.
For indexes on multiple fields, each combination of values must be unique
across the index. The database rejects any update and insert operations that
attempt to create index entries with duplicate values. If the data
of the indexed fields contains duplicate values and you attempt
to create a unique index, then the index build fails with an error message
in the operation details.
Absent fields in a unique index
If you insert a document with missing fields for the unique index, the index
sets null values for the missing fields. The resulting index entry must be
unique or the operation fails.
For example, with this index:
db.cities.createIndex ( { "name" : 1 } , { unique: true } )
If you add the document {"abbreviation": "LA"} to the collection, the unique
index creates an entry with name set to null . If you then try to add the
document {"abbreviation": "NYC"} , the operation fails because the resulting
entry for the unique index is the same.
The same behavior applies to unique indexes with multiple fields.
When creating or updating a document, missing
indexed fields are set to null and the resulting index entry must be
unique in the index.
TTL indexes
Use TTL indexes to automatically
remove stale data from your databases. A TTL index designates a given field as
the expiration time for documents in a given collection. With TTL, you can
decrease storage costs by cleaning out obsolete data. Data is typically deleted
within 24 hours after its expiration time.
Troubleshoot index building errors
You might encounter index building errors when managing your indexes. An
indexing operation can fail if the database encounters a problem with the data.
Indexing operations can fail for the following reasons:
You have reached an index limit. For example, the operation may have reached the
maximum number of index entries per document. If index creation fails, you
see an error message. If you have not reached an index limit, retry the
index operation.
A multikey index is required. At least one of the indexed fields
contains an array value. To proceed, you must either use a multikey index
or delete the array values.
An operation attempts to index multiple fields with array values. You
cannot have more than one field with an array value in a multikey index.
To proceed, modify your data model or your index definitions.
You set the unique index option and the data of the indexed fields would
create duplicate index entries. To proceed, remove duplicate combinations
of values from the data.
Warning: An ongoing index building error might impact creation of new indexes.
