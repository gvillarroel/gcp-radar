Configure Private Google Access in Firestore with MongoDB compatibility
This page describes how to enable and configure Private Google Access in
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility.
About Private Google Access in Firestore with MongoDB compatibility
By default, when a Compute Engine VM lacks an external IP address
assigned to its network interface, it can only send packets to other internal
IP address destinations. You can allow these VMs to connect to the
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility service by enabling Private Google Access on the subnet
used by the VM's network interface.
Applicable services and protocols
Instructions in this guide apply only to Firestore with MongoDB compatibility .
The default and VIP domains used by the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility and their IP
ranges support only the MongoDB protocol on port 443. All other protocols
aren't supported.
Note: To configure Private Google Access for Firestore and other
services, see
Configure Private Google Access .
Network requirements
A VM interface can reach Google APIs and services through the internal Google
network using Private Google Access if all these conditions are met:
The VM interface is connected to a subnet where Private Google Access is
enabled.
The VM interface doesn't have an external IP address assigned.
The source IP address of packets sent from the VM matches one of the following
IP addresses.
The VM interface's primary internal IPv4 address
An internal IPv4 address from an alias IP range
A VM with an
external IPv4 address assigned to its network interface
doesn't need Private Google Access to connect to Google APIs and services.
However, the VPC network must meet
the requirements for accessing Google APIs and services .
IAM permissions
Project owners, editors, and IAM principals with the
Network Admin
role can create or update subnets and assign IP addresses.
For more information on roles, read the
IAM roles
documentation.
Logging
Cloud Logging captures all API requests made from VM instances in subnets
that have Private Google Access enabled. Log entries identify the source of
the API request as an internal IP address of the calling instance.
You can configure daily usage and monthly rollup reports to be delivered to a
Cloud Storage bucket. See the
Viewing Usage Reports
page for details.
Configuration summary
The following table summarizes the different ways that you can configure
Private Google Access in Firestore with MongoDB compatibility. For more detailed instructions
information, see Network configuration .
Domain option
IP ranges
DNS configuration
Routing configuration
Firewall configuration
Default domain ( firestore.goog )
The default domains are used when you don't configure DNS records
for restricted.firestore.goog .
136.124.0.0/23
You access the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility service through its public IP
addresses, so no special DNS configuration is required.
Check that your VPC network can route traffic to
the IP address ranges that are used by the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility
service.
Basic configuration :
Confirm that you have default routes with next hop
default-internet-gateway and a destination
range of 0.0.0.0/0 . Create those routes if they are
missing.
Custom configuration :
Create routes to the 136.124.0.0/23 IP address
range.
Check that your firewall rules allow
egress to the 136.124.0.0/23 IP address range.
The default allow egress firewall rule allows this traffic, if there
is no higher priority rule that blocks it.
restricted.firestore.goog
Use restricted.firestore.goog to access the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility
service by using a set of IP addresses only routable from within
Google Cloud. Can be used in VPC Service Controls scenarios.
199.36.153.2/31
Configure DNS records to send requests
to the 199.36.153.2/31 IP address range.
Check that your VPC network has
routes to the 199.36.153.2/31
IP address range.
Check that your firewall rules allow
egress to the 199.36.153.2/31 IP address range.
Network configuration
This section describes how to configure your network to access the
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility using Private Google Access.
DNS configuration
Note: There are public DNS records restricted.firestore.goog . However, you can't
use the public records when you configure Private Google Access. You must
create a private DNS zone and records.
Unlike other Google APIs, the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility API
uses different domain names and IP addresses for Private Google Access:
restricted.firestore.goog enables API access to the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility API.
IP addresses: 199.36.153.2 and 199.36.153.3 .
Because Firestore with MongoDB compatibility is compliant with VPC Service Controls, you
can use this domain in VPC Service Controls scenarios.
To create a DNS zone and records for Firestore with MongoDB compatibility:
Create a private DNS zone for firestore.goog .
Consider
creating a Cloud DNS private zone
for this purpose.
In the firestore.goog zone, create the following records:
An A record for restricted.firestore.goog
that points to the following IP addresses:
199.36.153.2 and 199.36.153.3 .
A CNAME record for *.firestore.goog that points to
restricted.firestore.goog .
To create these records in Cloud DNS, see
add a record .
Routing configuration
Your VPC network must have appropriate routes whose next hops
are the default internet gateway. Google Cloud doesn't support routing
traffic to Google APIs and services through other VM instances or custom next
hops. Despite being called default internet gateway , packets sent from VMs
in your VPC network to Google APIs and services remain within
Google's network.
If you select the default domain option, your VM instances connect to the
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility service using the following public IP address
range: 136.124.0.0/23 . These IP addresses are publicly
routable, but the path from a VM in a VPC network to those
addresses remains within Google's network.
Google doesn't publish routes on the internet to any of the IP addresses used
by the restricted.firestore.goog domain. Consequently, this domain can only be
accessed by VMs in a VPC network or on-premises
systems connected to a VPC network.
If your VPC network contains a
default route
whose next hop is the default internet gateway, you can use that route to
access the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility service, without needing to create custom
routes. See routing with a default route for details.
If you have replaced a default route (destination 0.0.0.0/0 or ::0/0 ) with
a custom route whose next hop is not the default internet gateway, you can
meet the routing requirements for the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility service
using custom routing instead.
Routing with a default route
Each VPC network contains an IPv4 default route ( 0.0.0.0/0 )
when it is created.
The default route provides a path to the IP addresses for the following
destinations:
Default domain ( firestore.goog ):
136.124.0.0/23
restricted.firestore.goog : 199.36.153.2/31
For Google Cloud console and Google Cloud CLI instructions on how to check the
configuration of a default route in a given network, see
Configure Private Google Access .
Routing with custom routes
As an alternative to a default route, you can use custom static routes, each
having a more specific destination, and each using the default internet gateway
next hop. The destination IP addresses for the routes depend on
the domain that you choose :
Default domain ( firestore.goog ):
136.124.0.0/23
restricted.firestore.goog : 199.36.153.2/31
For Google Cloud console and Google Cloud CLI instructions on how to check the
configuration of custom routes in a given network, see
Configure Private Google Access .
Firewall configuration
The firewall configuration of your VPC network must allow
access from VMs to the IP addresses used by the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility
service. The implied allow egress rule satisfies this requirement.
In some firewall configurations, you need to create specific egress allow rules.
For example, suppose you've created an egress deny rule that blocks traffic to
all destinations ( 0.0.0.0 for IPv4). In that case, you must create one egress
allow firewall rule whose priority is higher than the egress deny rule for each
IP address range used by the the domain that you choose :
Default domain ( firestore.goog : 136.124.0.0/23
restricted.firestore.goog : 199.36.153.2/31
To create firewall rules, see
Creating firewall rules .
You can limit the VMs to which the firewall rules apply when you define
the target of
each egress allow rule.
Private Google Access configuration
You can enable Private Google Access after you've met the
network requirements in your VPC
network. For Google Cloud console and Google Cloud CLI instructions, follow the
steps outlined in
Enable Private Google Access .
