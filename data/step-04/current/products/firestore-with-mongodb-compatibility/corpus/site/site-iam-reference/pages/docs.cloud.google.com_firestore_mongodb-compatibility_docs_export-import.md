Import and export data
You can use the managed export and import service to
recover from accidental deletion of data and to export data for offline
processing. You can export all documents or just specific collections. Likewise,
you can import all data from an export or only specific collections. Data
exported from one Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database can be imported into another
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database. You can also load
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility exports into BigQuery .
This page describes how to export and import Firestore with MongoDB compatibility documents using
the managed export and import service and Cloud Storage . The
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility managed export and import service is available through
the gcloud
command-line tool and the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility
API ( REST , RPC ).
Caution: Exporting data from Firestore with MongoDB compatibility will incur one read
operation per document exported. However, these reads will not appear in the
usage section of the console. Make sure you understand this before setting up
recurring exports to avoid an unexpected bill.
Before you begin
Before you can use the managed export and import service, you must complete the
following tasks:
Enable
billing for your Google Cloud project. Only Google Cloud
projects with billing enabled can use the export and import functionality.
Create a
Cloud Storage bucket for your project in a location near your
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database location . You cannot use a
Requester Pays bucket for export and import operations.
Make sure your account has the necessary permissions for
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility and Cloud Storage. If you are the project owner,
your account has the required permissions. Otherwise, the following
roles grant the necessary permissions for export and import operations and
for access to Cloud Storage:
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility roles:
Owner , Cloud Datastore Owner , or Cloud Datastore Import Export Admin
Note: These Datastore roles also grant
permissions in Firestore with MongoDB compatibility.
Cloud Storage roles:
Owner or Storage Admin
Service agent permissions
Export and import operations use a Firestore service agent to
authorize Cloud Storage operations. The Firestore service agent
uses the following naming convention:
Firestore service agent
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-firestore.iam.gserviceaccount.com
To learn more about service agents, see
Service agents .
Note: Firestore previously used the App Engine default service
account instead of the Firestore service agent. If your database
still uses the App Engine service account to import or export data, we
recommend that you
migrate to the service specific Firestore service agent .
You can view which account your import and export operations use
in the Google Cloud console.
If you use VPC Service Controls, you must use the service-specific
Firestore service agent to fully protect import and export
operations. VPC Service Controls are not compatible with the App Engine service
account.
The Firestore service agent requires access to the
Cloud Storage bucket used in an export or import operation. If your
Cloud Storage bucket is in the same project as your Firestore
database, then the Firestore service agent can access the
bucket by default .
If the Cloud Storage bucket is in another project, then you
must give the Firestore service agent access to the Cloud Storage
bucket.
Assign roles to the service agent
You can use the gsutil command-line tool to
assign one of the roles below. For example, to assign the Storage Admin role
to the Firestore service agent, run the following:
gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-firestore.iam.gserviceaccount.com:roles/storage.admin \
gs:// [ BUCKET_NAME ]
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with your project number, which
is used to name your Firestore service agent. To view the
service agent name, see View service agent name .
Alternatively, you can
assign this role using the Google Cloud console .
View service agent name
You can view the account that your import and export operations use to authorize
requests from the Import/Export page in the Google Cloud console. You can also
view whether your database uses the Firestore
service agent or the legacy App Engine service account.
View the authorization account next to the
Import/Export jobs run as label.
The service agent needs the Storage Admin role for the Cloud Storage
bucket to be used for the export or import operation.
Set up gcloud for your project
You can initiate import and export operations through the Google Cloud console or
the gcloud command-line tool. To use gcloud , set up the command-line tool
and connect to your project in one of the following ways:
Access gcloud from the Google Cloud console using Cloud Shell .
Start Cloud Shell
Make sure gcloud is configured for the correct project:
gcloud config set project [ PROJECT_ID ]
Install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK.
Import data
Once you have export files in Cloud Storage, you can import documents in those
files back into your project or to another project. Note the following points
about import operations:
When you import data, the required indexes are updated using your database's
current index definitions. An export does not contain index definitions.
Imports don't assign new document IDs. Imports use the IDs captured at
the time of the export. As a document is being imported, its ID is reserved
to prevent ID collisions. If a document with the same ID already exists, the
import overwrites the existing document.
If a document in your database is not affected by an import, it will remain
in your database after the import.
The .overall_export_metadata filename must match the name of its parent
folder:
gs://BUCKET_NAME/OPTIONAL_NAMESPACE_PATH/ PARENT_FOLDER_NAME / PARENT_FOLDER_NAME .overall_export_metadata
If you move or copy the output files of an export, keep the
PARENT_FOLDER_NAME and .overall_export_metadata filename the
same.
An import to a Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database from an export with
sub-collections fails since sub-collections are not supported in
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility.
An import to a Firestore Standard edition database from an export with
BSON types fails since BSON types are not supported in Firestore Standard edition.
An import to a Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database cannot import data from non-default namespaces (Datastore API).
An import to a Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database from data files that contain non-default
namespaces is permitted only if the export operation included a
--namespace-ids
filter with the default namespace. Only data from the default namespace is imported.
Import all documents from an export
Google Cloud Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select a database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Import/Export .
Click Import .
In the Filename field, enter the filename of an
.overall_export_metadata file from a completed export operation. You can
use the Browse button to help you select the file.
Click Import .
The console returns to the Import/Export page. If the operation successfully starts,
the page adds an entry to the recent imports and exports page. On failure,
the page displays an error message.
gcloud
Use the firestore import command to import documents from a
previous export operation.
gcloud firestore import gs:// [BUCKET_NAME] / [EXPORT_PREFIX] / --database= [DATABASE]
Replace the following:
BUCKET_NAME/EXPORT_PREFIX : location of your
export files.
DATABASE : name of the database.
For example:
gcloud firestore import gs://my-bucket/2017-05-25T23:54:39_76544/ --database='cymbal'
You can confirm the location of your export files in the
Cloud Storage browser in the Google Cloud console:
Open Cloud Storage browser
Once you start an import operation, closing the terminal does not cancel the
operation, see cancel an operation .
Import specific collections
Note: To import specific collections, you must use the output
of an export operation where you
exported specific collections .
Google Cloud Console
You cannot select specific collections in the console. Use gcloud instead.
gcloud
To import specific collections from a set of export files, use the
--collection-ids flag. The operation imports
only the collections with the given collection IDs.
Specify the database name using the --database flag.
Only an export of specific collections supports an import of specific
collections. You cannot import specific collections from an export of all
documents.
gcloud firestore import gs:// [BUCKET_NAME] / [EXPORT_PREFIX] / \
--collection-ids= [COLLECTION_ID_1] , [COLLECTION_ID_2] \
--database= [DATABASE]
Import from an export with PITR data
Use the same steps as in Import all documents
or Import specific collections to import
PITR data. If any document already exists in your database, it will be
overwritten.
Export data
An export operation copies documents in your database to a set of files in a
Cloud Storage bucket. Note that an export is not an exact database snapshot taken
at the export start time. An export may include changes made while the operation
was running.
Note: You must
export specific collections
if you plan to:
Import only specific collections
Load Firestore with MongoDB compatibility
data into BigQuery
Export all documents
Google Cloud Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select the required database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Import/Export .
Click Export .
Click the Export entire database option.
Select Export current state of database to export current data.
In the Destination section, enter the name of a Cloud Storage bucket
or use the Browse button to select a bucket.
Click Export .
The console returns to the Import/Export page. If the operation successfully starts,
the page adds an entry to the recent imports and exports page. On failure,
the page displays an error message.
gcloud
Use the firestore export command to export all
the documents in your database, replacing [BUCKET_NAME] with the name of your
Cloud Storage bucket. Add the --async flag to prevent the gcloud tool from
waiting for the operation to complete.
gcloud firestore export gs:// [BUCKET_NAME] \
--database= [DATABASE]
Replace the following:
BUCKET_NAME : organize your exports by adding a file prefix after
the bucket name, for example, BUCKET_NAME/my-exports-folder/export-name . If
you don't provide a file prefix, the managed export service
creates one based on the current timestamp.
DATABASE : name of the database from which you want to export
the documents.
Once you start an export operation, closing the terminal does not cancel the
operation, see cancel an operation .
Export specific collections
Google Cloud Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select the required database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Import/Export .
Click Export .
Click the Export one or more collection groups option. Use the drop-down
menu to select one or more collections.
Select Export current state of database to export current data.
In the Destination section, enter the name of a Cloud Storage bucket
or use the Browse button to select a bucket.
Click Export .
The console returns to the Import/Export page. If the operation successfully starts,
the page adds an entry to the recent imports and exports page. On failure,
the page displays an error message.
gcloud
To export specific collections, use the
--collection-ids flag. The operation exports only
the collections with the given collection IDs.
gcloud firestore export gs:// [BUCKET_NAME] \
--collection-ids= [COLLECTION_ID_1] , [COLLECTION_ID_2] \
--database= [DATABASE]
For example, you can design a restaurants collection in the foo database to include additional collections, such as ratings , reviews , or outlets . To export specific collection restaurants and reviews , your command looks as
follows:
gcloud firestore export gs:// [BUCKET_NAME] \
--collection-ids=restaurants,reviews \
--database='cymbal'
Export from a PITR timestamp
You can export your database to Cloud Storage from PITR data .
You can export PITR data where the timestamp is a whole minute timestamp within
the past seven days, but not earlier than the earliestVersionTime . If data no
longer exists at the specified timestamp, the export operation fails.
The PITR export operation supports all filters, including exporting all
documents and exporting specific collections.
Note the following points before exporting PITR data:
Specify the timestamp in
RFC 3339 format . For example, 2020-09-01T23:59:30.234233Z .
Make sure that the timestamp you specify is a whole minute timestamp
within the past seven days, but not earlier than the
earliestVersionTime . If data no longer exists at the specified
timestamp, an error is generated.
You are not charged for a failed PITR export.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select a database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Import/Export .
Click Export .
Configure the export source to export either the entire database or only specific collections.
In the Choose the state of your database to export section,
select Export from an earlier point in time .
Select a snapshot time to use for the export
In the Destination section, enter the name of a Cloud Storage
bucket or use the Browse button to select a bucket.
Click Export .
The console returns to the Import/Export page. If the operation successfully starts,
the page adds an entry to the recent imports and exports page. On failure,
the page displays an error message.
gcloud
You can export your database to Cloud Storage from
PITR data using the gcloud firestore export command.
Export the database, specifying the snapshot-time parameter to a recovery timestamp. Run the following command to export the database to your bucket.
gcloud firestore export gs : //[ BUCKET_NAME_PATH ] \
--snapshot-time=[ PITR_TIMESTAMP ]
Where PITR_TIMESTAMP is a PITR timestamp at the minute granularity, for example, 2023-05-26T10:20:00.00Z .
Add the --collection-ids flag to export specific collections.
Manage export and import operations
After you start an export or import operation, Firestore with MongoDB compatibility assigns
the operation a unique name. You can use the operation name to delete,
cancel, or status check the operation.
Operation names are prefixed with projects/[PROJECT_ID]/databases/[DATABASE_ID]/operations/ ,
for example:
projects/my-project/databases/my-database/operations/ASA1MTAwNDQxNAgadGx1YWZlZAcSeWx0aGdpbi1zYm9qLW5pbWRhEgopEg
However, you can leave out the prefix when specifying an operation name for
the describe , cancel , and delete commands.
List all export and import operations
Google Cloud Console
You can view a list of recent export and import operations in the
Import/Export page of the Google Cloud console.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select the required database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Import/Export .
gcloud
Use the operations list command to see all running and
recently completed export and import operations:
gcloud firestore operations list
Check operation status
Google Cloud Console
You can view the status of a recent export or import operation in the
Import/Export page of the Google Cloud console.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select the required database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Import/Export .
gcloud
Use the operations describe command to show the status of an export
or import operation.
gcloud firestore operations describe [OPERATION_NAME]
Estimate the completion time
A request for the status of a long-running operation returns the metrics
workEstimated and workCompleted . Each of these metrics is returned in both
number of bytes and number of entities:
workEstimated shows the estimated total number of bytes and documents an
operation will process. Firestore with MongoDB compatibility might omit this metric if it
cannot make an estimate.
workCompleted shows the number of bytes and documents processed so far.
After the operation completes, the value shows the total number of
bytes and documents that were actually processed, which might be larger than the
value of workEstimated .
Divide workCompleted by workEstimated for a rough progress estimate. This
estimate might be inaccurate, because it depends on delayed statistics
collection.
Cancel an operation
Google Cloud Console
You can cancel a running export or import operation in the
Import/Export page of the Google Cloud console.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select the required database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Import/Export .
In the Recent imports and exports table, currently running
operations include a Cancel button in the Completed column. Click the
Cancel button to stop the operation. The button changes to a Cancelling
message and then to Cancelled when the operation stops completely.
gcloud
Use the operations cancel command to stop an operation in progress:
gcloud firestore operations cancel [OPERATION_NAME]
Cancelling a running operation does not undo the operation. A cancelled export
operation will leave documents already exported in Cloud Storage, and a cancelled
import operation will leave in place updates already made to your database. You
cannot import a partially completed export.
Delete an operation
Use the gcloud firestore operations delete command to remove
an operation from the list of recent operations. This command will not delete
export files from Cloud Storage.
gcloud firestore operations delete [OPERATION_NAME]
Billing and pricing for export and import operations
You are required to enable billing for your Google Cloud project before you use
the managed export and import service.
Export and import operations are charged
for read units and write units at the rates listed in
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility pricing .
Output files stored in Cloud Storage count towards your
Cloud Storage data storage costs .
Export or import operations won't trigger your
Google Cloud budget alerts until after completion. Export and import
operations won't affect the usage shown in the usage section of the console.
Viewing export and import costs
Export and import operations apply the goog-firestoremanaged:exportimport
label to billed operations. In the Cloud Billing reports page ,
you can use this label to view costs related to import and export operations:
Note: Export and import operations executed before September 8th, 2020 did not
apply the goog-firestoremanaged label.
Export to BigQuery
You can load data from a Firestore with MongoDB compatibility export into BigQuery,
but only if you specified a collection-ids filter. See
Loading data from Firestore with MongoDB compatibility exports .
When loading Firestore with MongoDB compatibility data into BigQuery, BSON data types are
represented with the STRING data type.
BigQuery column limit
BigQuery imposes a limit of 10,000 columns per table.
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility export operations generate a BigQuery table
schema for each collection. In this schema, each unique field name within
a collection becomes a schema column.
If a collection's BigQuery schema surpasses 10,000 columns, the
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility export operation attempts to stay under the column limit
by treating map fields as bytes. If this conversion brings the
number of columns below 10,000, you can load the data into
BigQuery, but you cannot query the subfields within the map fields.
If the number of columns still exceeds 10,000, the export operation does not
generate a BigQuery schema for the collection and you cannot load
its data into BigQuery.
Export format and metadata files
The output of a managed export uses the
LevelDB log format .
Metadata files
An export operation creates a metadata file for each collection
you specify. Metadata files are typically named
ALL_NAMESPACES_KIND_[COLLECTION_GROUP_ID].export_metadata .
The metadata files are protocol buffers and you can decode them with the
protoc protocol compiler .
For example, you can decode a metadata file to determine the collections
the export files contain:
protoc --decode_raw < export0.export_metadata
