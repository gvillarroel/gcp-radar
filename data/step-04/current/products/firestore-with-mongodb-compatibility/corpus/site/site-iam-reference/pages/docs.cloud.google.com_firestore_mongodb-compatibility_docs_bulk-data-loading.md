Best practices for bulk data loading
This page describes the best practices when bulk loading data to Firestore with MongoDB compatibility
with tools like mongoimport .
Firestore is a highly distributed system offering automatic
scaling to meet the needs of your business. Firestore dynamically
splits and combines your data based on the load received by the system.
Load-based splitting happens automatically without any required
pre-configuration. The Firestore load-based splitting system has some
important, unique characteristics compared to other document databases that
are important to keep in mind as you model your data.
Firestore's distributed nature can require changing some design choices
to change, particularly for workloads that were optimized for
databases where the primary replica is the bottleneck for write throughput.
Best Practices
Workloads that process large amounts of data in a single threaded client can
create a bottleneck. Clients might be able to use single threading to bulk load
data, as the throughput of the client and server are similarly matched.
A Firestore database can handle significantly more parallelism, but
this requires that you configure clients to send requests in parallel.
mongoimport
When using the mongoimport tool, requests are made sequentially by default.
To improve the load time into Firestore,
set the number of workers with the --numInsertionWorkers flag.
The correct setting might require tuning based on
the size of your client, but we generally recommend starting with at least 32 .
async programming
When developing your own software using MongoDB compatible operations, you can
improve parallelism in the following ways:
Async frameworks : using async frameworks let you process and respond
to requests in parallel. It is not necessary to
develop any complex pooling or queuing when making calls to your database.
Each request flow can use independent connections and make their
database calls in parallel.
Use parallelized compute offerings : using services like Cloud Run,
your system can scale the number of computation workers required to process data.
Transient Failures
When working with a large distributed system like Firestore, you might encounter
transient failures such as network blips or contention on a
document.
When bulk loading large amounts of information, it's important to
maintain a retry strategy for failed writes without failing the larger bulk load
operation.
Note: Firestore with MongoDB compatibility does not support
retryWrites . We recommend using transactions to ensure your application
guarantees idempotency.
