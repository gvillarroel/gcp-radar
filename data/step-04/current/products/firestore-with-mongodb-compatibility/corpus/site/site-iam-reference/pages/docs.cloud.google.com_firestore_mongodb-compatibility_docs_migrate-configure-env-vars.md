Configure environment variables
This page describes the preparation part of the
migration process
where you configure environment variables in your local environment. From this
environment, you will later execute the commands that configure and actuate the
migration process. Each of these commands will use one or more environment
variables that you set at this stage.
At this stage, you do the following:
Set environment variables that are common to all supported
MongoDB-compatible sources.
Set environment variables that are specific to the type of the
MongoDB-compatible source database and to how it is deployed.
Set common environment variables
The following template helps to set up environment variables that are common to
all supported MongoDB-compatible sources. You will add extra variables that are
specific to your MongoDB source later.
The template configures the following set of environment variables:
General parameters that are applicable to the entire migration procedure.
Datastream connection parameters that are used to create
and manage
Datastream connection profiles .
Datastream data placement parameters for managing data
placement in the Cloud Storage bucket during the migration.
Dataflow template parameters for managing the pipeline
that will copy data from the Cloud Storage bucket into your
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database.
Additional Dataflow template parameters these parameters
are derived from other parameters that you specify and you don't need to set
them.
Firestore connection parameters for establishing a
connection to your destination Firestore with MongoDB
compatibility database.
Set the following variables before proceeding with other commands in this guide:
# General parameters
PROJECT_ID = " PROJECT_ID "
LOCATION = " LOCATION "
# Datastream connection parameters
SRC_CONNECTION_PROFILE_NAME = " SRC_CONNECTION_PROFILE_NAME "
DST_CONNECTION_PROFILE_NAME = " DST_CONNECTION_PROFILE_NAME "
DATASTREAM_NAME = " DATASTREAM_NAME "
# Datastream data placement parameters
GCS_BUCKET_NAME = " GCS_BUCKET_NAME "
GCS_BUCKET_ROOT_PATH = " GCS_BUCKET_ROOT_PATH "
GCS_BUCKET_SUB_PATH = " GCS_BUCKET_SUB_PATH "
# Dataflow template parameters
GCS_BUCKET_TEMPLATE_PATH = " GCS_BUCKET_TEMPLATE_PATH "
NUM_WORKERS = NUM_WORKERS
MAX_WORKERS = MAX_WORKERS
WORKER_TYPE = " WORKER_TYPE "
# Additional Dataflow template parameters: these are initialized
# from parameters above and don't require further customization
INPUT_FILE_LOCATION = "gs:// ${ GCS_BUCKET_NAME } / ${ GCS_BUCKET_ROOT_PATH } / ${ GCS_BUCKET_SUB_PATH } /"
TEMP_OUTPUT_LOCATION = "gs:// ${ GCS_BUCKET_NAME } / ${ GCS_BUCKET_ROOT_PATH } /tmp"
DLQ_LOCATION = "gs:// ${ GCS_BUCKET_NAME } / ${ GCS_BUCKET_ROOT_PATH } /dql"
STAGING_LOCATION = "gs:// ${ GCS_BUCKET_NAME } / ${ GCS_BUCKET_ROOT_PATH } /staging"
# Firestore connection parameters
FIRESTORE_CONNECTION_URI = " FIRESTORE_CONNECTION_URI "
FIRESTORE_DATABASE_NAME = " FIRESTORE_DATABASE_NAME "
Replace the following:
General parameters:
PROJECT_ID : a
Project ID
of the Google Cloud project where the migration pipeline will run.
Example: example-project .
It's possible to use a destination Firestore with
MongoDB compatibility database that is located in another project.
However, this guide assumes that all relevant resources are located in
the same project.
LOCATION :
a region where the
migration pipeline will run. Examples: nam5 , us-central1 .
We recommed to use the same region as the destination
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database.
Datastream connection parameters:
SRC_CONNECTION_PROFILE_NAME : a human-readable name for the
Datastream connection profile
of the MongoDB-compatible source database.
Example: source-mongo-profile .
You create a connection profile with this name later.
DST_CONNECTION_PROFILE_NAME : a human-readable name for the
Datastream connection profile
for the destination Cloud Storage bucket. Example:
destination-gcs-profile .
You create a destination connection profile with this name later.
DATASTREAM_NAME : A human-readable name of a
Datastream stream
that will transfer the data from the MongoDB-compatible source database
into Cloud Storage. Example: mongo-to-gcs-stream .
You create this stream later.
Datastream data placement parameters:
Note: Wildcards are not supported in the Cloud Storage paths.
GCS_BUCKET_NAME : the name of the
Cloud Storage bucket that you've
created earlier .
Example: mongo-migration-bucket .
This value is used to create a destination connection profile later.
GCS_BUCKET_ROOT_PATH : The name of the top-level directory
in the Cloud Storage bucket for placing the intermediate data
during the migration. Example: mongo-migration-root .
This value is used to create a destination connection profile later.
GCS_BUCKET_TEMPLATE_PATH : A sub-path in the
GCS_BUCKET_ROOT_PATH directory for a given
Datastream instance.
The same destination connection profile can be used for multiple
exports to Cloud Storage. However you must designate a
unique sub-path for each migration. Example: mongo-migration-data-0 .
This value is used to create a stream later.
Dataflow template parameters:
GCS_BUCKET_TEMPLATE_PATH : A sub-path in the
GCS_BUCKET_ROOT_PATH directory where a
Dataflow template
will be staged. Example: mongo-migration-template-path .
NUM_WORKERS : The starting number of workers to run the
Dataflow template with. Example: 2 .
MAX_WORKERS : The maximum number of workers to run the
Dataflow template with. Example: 8 .
WORKER_TYPE : The Compute Engine instance type to use for
the Dataflow job. The recommended machine type is
e2-highmem-8 .
Firestore connection parameters:
FIRESTORE_DATABASE_NAME : The name of the
Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database
where you migrate the data. Example: firestore-database-name .
FIRESTORE_CONNECTION_URI : The
connection URI string
for the Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database.
Example: mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@CONNECTION_STRING:443/ FIRESTORE_DATABASE_NAME ?loadBalanced=true&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256&tls=true&retryWrites=false .
Set environment variables specific to the source database type
The following templates help to set up environment variables that are specific
to the type of the MongoDB-compatible source database and to how it is deployed.
MongoDB on Compute Engine
The following variables are specific for MongoDB source databases located in a
self-managed cluster (Compute Engine). Set them before proceeding
with other commands in this guide:
# Google Compute Engine VM MongoDB Parameters
MONGODB_USERNAME = " MONGODB_USERNAME "
MONGODB_PASSWORD = " MONGODB_PASSWORD "
MONGODB_IP_ADDRESS = " MONGODB_IP_ADDRESS "
REPLICA_SET = " REPLICA_SET "
MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME = " MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME "
PRIVATE_CONNECTION_NAME = " PRIVATE_CONNECTION_NAME "
Replace the following:
MONGODB_USERNAME : The username of the MongoDB-compatible source
database. Example: mongouser .
MONGODB_PASSWORD : The password of the MongoDB-compatible source
database. Example: mongopassword .
MONGODB_IP_ADDRESS : specify the internal IP address, along with
the port number, of the VM that hosts your MongoDB server.
Example: 10.0.0.1:27017 .
For deployments that are not sharded, but configured with
replica sets ,
the IP address of any replica in the set is valid. However, we
recommend to use one of the secondary replicas.
For sharded clusters ,
specify the address of one of your mongos servers.
(Only for clusters with replica sets that aren't sharded)
REPLICA_SET : Specify the name of the replica
set that must be used for the migration process. Example: rs0 .

database. Example: source_db .
PRIVATE_CONNECTION_NAME : The ID of the private connectivity
configuration that
you've created earlier .
Example: pc_name .
MongoDB over SSH
If you are managing a private MongoDB deployment outside of
Compute Engine, Datastream supports connecting to your source
database over a forward-SSH tunnel. For more information, see SSH tunnels .
The following variables are specific for connecting to MongoDB source
databases over a forward-SSH tunnel. Set them before proceeding with other
commands in this guide:
# MongoDB over an SSH Tunnel Parameters

set that must be used for the migration process. Example: rs0 .
MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME : The name of the MongoDB-compatible source
database. Example: source_db .
BASTION_IP_ADDRESS : the address of the host on your network that
can accept an SSH connection. This can be the MongoDB server itself, or
a designated Bastion host that
allows SSH access from a public network, and also provides internal
connectivity to the actual MongoDB server.
Example: 30.0.0.1 .
BASTION_SSH_PORT : The SSH port on the host. Example: 22 .
BASTION_SSH_USERNAME : Username for the ssh connection.
BASTION_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY : The full payload of the SSH private key.
For example, for an RSA key, this payload would include the
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- header and the
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- footer.
Example: BASTION_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/private_key)
Note: Datastream also accepts an SSH password. This alternative is
described in the Connection Profile section.
Amazon DocumentDB
Ensure that you have the private SSH key for the Amazon EC2 instance that
will provide the connection to the DocumentDB cluster. Also ensure that you
have downloaded the region-specific Certificate Bundle as described in the
Resource Configuration
section, and extracted and validated a specific certificate.
