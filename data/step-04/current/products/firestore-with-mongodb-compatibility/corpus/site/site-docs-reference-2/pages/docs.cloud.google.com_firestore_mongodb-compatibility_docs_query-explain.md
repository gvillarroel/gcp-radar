Analyze query execution with Query Explain
This page describes how to retrieve query execution information when you execute a query.
Use Query Explain
You can use Query Explain to understand how your queries are being executed.
This provides details that you can use to optimize your queries .
You can use Query Explain through the Google Cloud console or the explain command.
Console
Execute a query in the Query Editor and open the Explanation tab:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
From the list of databases, select a Firestore with MongoDB compatibility database.
The Google Cloud console opens the Firestore Explorer for that database.
Enter a query in the query editor and click Run .
Click the Explanation tab to view the query analysis output.
MongoDB API
Query Explain in the MongoDB API is supported through the
explain
command which you can use in tools such as Mongo Shell and Compass.
The explain command is supported with the aggregate ,
find , distinct , and count
commands, for example:
db.collection.explain('executionStats').find(...)
You can also use the explain() method, for example:
db.collection.find({ QUERY }).explain('executionStats')
Limitations
Note the following limitations and differences:
Query Explain does not support commands which return a cursor. For example,
invoking explain by calling the following command directly is not supported:
db . collection . aggregate (..., explain: true )
Query Explain is only supported on the
find , aggregate , count , and distinct
commands.
The Verbosity and Comment options of Query Explain
are not supported through the MongoDB API. The behaviour matches the
executionStats option. The allPlansExecution and
queryPlanner options are ignored if provided.
If no verbosity is provided, the shell uses the queryPlanner
verbosity and filters out execution stats. You must use the
executionStats or allPlansExecution verbosity
to see the full output.
Analysis
The output of Query Explain contains two main components-the Summary Statistics and Execution Tree.
Consider this query as an example:
db.order.aggregate(
[
{ "$match": { "user_id": 1234 } },
{ "$sort": { "date_placed": 1 } }
]
)
Summary Statistics
The top of the explained output contains a summary of the execution statistics.
Use these statistics to determine if a query has high latency or cost. It also
contains memory statistics which let you know how close your query is
to memory limits .
Billing Metrics:
read units: 1
Execution Metrics:
request peak memory usage: 4.00 KiB (4,096 B)
results returned: 1
Execution Tree
The execution tree describes the query execution as a series of nodes. The
bottom nodes (leaf nodes) retrieve data from the storage layer which traverses
up the tree to generate a query response.
For details about each execution node,
refer to the Execution reference .
For details on how to use this information to optimize your queries,
see Optimize query execution .
The following is an example of an execution tree:
• Compute
| $out_1: map_set($record_1, "__id__", $__id___1, "__key__", $__key___1, "__row_id__", $__row_id___1, "__$0__", $__$0___2)
| is query result: true
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 1
|
└── • Compute
| $__$0___2: UNSET
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 1
|
└── • Compute
| $__key___1: UNSET
| $__row_id___1: UNSET
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 1
|
└── • Compute
| $__id___1: _id($record_1.__key__)
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 1
|
└── • MajorSort
| fields: [$v_5 ASC]
| output: [$record_1]
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 1
| peak memory usage: 4.00 KiB (4,096 B)
|
└── • Compute
| $v_5: array_get($v_4, 0L)
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 1
|
└── • Compute
| $v_4: sortPaths(array($record_1.date_placed), [date_placed ASC])
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 1
|
└── • Filter
| expression: $eq($user_id_1, 1,234)
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 1
|
└── • TableScan
source: **/my_collection
order: STABLE
properties: * - { __create_time__, __update_time__ }
output record: $record_1
output bindings: {$user_id_1=user_id}
variables: [$record_1, $user_id_1]
Execution:
records returned: 1
records scanned: 1
