View and act on justifications
This page describes how you can view and act on justifications that Key Access Justifications
sends to request access to your encryption keys. Whenever your information is
encrypted or decrypted, Key Access Justifications sends you a justification describing the
reason for the access. The way you view and act on justifications depends on the
type of keys you're using with Key Access Justifications:
For externally managed keys, the Cloud EKM partner may provide the
ability to set a policy that automatically approves or denies access requests
based on the content of the justifications. For more information about setting
a policy, see the relevant documentation for your chosen key manager. The
following partners support Key Access Justifications:
Fortanix
Thales
For all keys configured with Key Access Justifications policies—regardless of key
type—you can view access requests in the Cloud KMS
audit logs.
Denying access can hinder the ability of Google personnel to help you with a
contracted service. For example:
Denying access for requests with reasons of CUSTOMER_INITIATED_ACCESS or
GOOGLE_INITIATED_SYSTEM_OPERATION results in your service becoming
unavailable.
Denying access for requests with the reason of CUSTOMER_INITATED_SUPPORT
limits the ability of Google personnel to respond to support tickets on the
rare occasion that your support ticket requires access to sensitive customer
information. Support tickets typically don't require this access and our
frontline support personnel don't have this access.
Denying access for request with the reason of GOOGLE_INITIATED_SERVICE
reduces service availability and reliability and inhibits Google's ability to
recover from outages.
Important: Justification codes for Key Access Justifications are similar to
Access Transparency codes ,
but they are not equivalent and shouldn't be directly compared.
View justifications for EKM keys
You can use the Google Cloud console to view the justification Key Access Justifications
sends to your external key manager when your data is accessed. To access the
justification, you first need to enable Cloud Audit Logs with Cloud KMS
on the project containing the key used for encryption.
After you have completed the setup, the Cloud Audit Logs also includes the
justification used in the external request for cryptographic operations. The
justification is included in the Data Access logs on the resource key, in
the metadata entries for protoPayload . For more information on these fields,
see Understanding audit logs .
For more information about using Cloud Audit Logs with Cloud KMS, see
Cloud KMS audit logging information .
Note that unlike the justification shared with the external key manager, the
justification in the Cloud Audit Logs cannot be used for approving or denying the
associated cryptographic operation. Google Cloud logs the justification only
after the operation is completed. Therefore, the logs in Google Cloud must be
used primarily for record keeping.
View justifications for Cloud HSM and software keys
When Cloud HSM and software keys
configured with Key Access Justifications
have been used to perform encryption or decryption operations, you can view the
Cloud KMS audit logs to
view the following information:
key_access_justification : The
justification code
associated with the request.
key_access_justification_policy_metadata : The Key Access Justifications policy metadata
for the key containing the following information:
customer_configured_policy_enforced : Indicates whether or not the
Key Access Justifications policy set on the key was enforced for the operation.
customer_configured_policy : Indicates the justification codes that allow
access to the key.
justification_propagated_to_ekm : Indicates whether the access request was
propagated to the external key manager (if configured).
The following example demonstrates a Cloud KMS audit log entry for an
Cloud HSM key configured with Key Access Justifications:
{
@ type : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog"
(...)
metadata : {
entries : {
key_access_justification : {
@ type : "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.ekms.v0.AccessReasonContext"
reason : "CUSTOMER_INITIATED_ACCESS"
}
key_access_justification_policy_metadata : {
customer_configured_policy_enforced : "true"
customer_configured_policy : {
allowed_access_reasons : [ "CUSTOMER_INITIATED_ACCESS" , "GOOGLE_INITIATED_SYSTEM_OPERATION" ]
}
justification_propagated_to_ekm : "false"
}
}
}
methodName : "useVersionToDecrypt"
serviceName : "cloudkms.googleapis.com"
(...)
}
