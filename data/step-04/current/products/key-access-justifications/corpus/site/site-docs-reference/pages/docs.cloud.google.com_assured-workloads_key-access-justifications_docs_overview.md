Overview of Key Access Justifications
This page provides an overview of Key Access Justifications. Key Access Justifications is a part of
Google's long-term commitment to transparency, user trust, and customer
ownership of their data. Key Access Justifications directs Google systems to generate access
justification codes
for each cryptographic operation involving enrolled Cloud Key Management Service
(Cloud KMS) keys.
Key Access Justifications works alongside
Access Approval
and Access Transparency in the
following way: Access Approval lets you authorize requests from Google
personnel to access Customer Data ,
Access Transparency helps you discover information about when Customer Data is
accessed, and Key Access Justifications provides key access control for all interactions with
at-rest Customer Data that is encrypted by a customer-managed key. Together,
each of these products provide access management capabilities that give you
control over and context for administrative requests to access Customer Data.
Overview
Key Access Justifications lets you set a policy on Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) keys to
view, approve, and deny key access requests depending on the provided
justification code .
For select external key management partners, you can configure Key Access Justifications
policies outside of Google Cloud to be exclusively enforced by the external key
manager rather than by Cloud KMS.
Depending on the
Assured Workloads control package
you choose, the following Key Access Justifications features are available:
For select
regional control packages ,
Key Access Transparency logs these justification codes in your Cloud KMS
audit logs .
For select regional,
regulatory , or
sovereign
control packages, Key Access Justifications lets you set a policy on your keys to approve
or deny key access requests depending on the provided justification code. Some
regional data boundaries provide this feature in addition to Key Access Transparency.
For select sovereign control packages, you can use a supported external key
management partners to configure Key Access Justifications policies outside of
Google Cloud. These policies are exclusively enforced by the external
key manager rather than by Cloud KMS.
In addition to these features, the Assured Workloads control package
you choose will also determine which of the following Cloud KMS key
types are available:
Cloud EKM keys
Cloud HSM keys
Cloud KMS software keys
How encryption at rest works
Google Cloud encryption at rest works by encrypting your data stored on
Google Cloud with an encryption key that lives outside the service where the
data is stored. For example, if you encrypt data in Cloud Storage, the
service only stores the encrypted information you have stored, whereas the key
used to encrypt that data is stored in Cloud KMS (if you are using
customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)) or in your external key manager (if you
are using Cloud EKM).
When you use a Google Cloud service, you want your applications to
continue working as described, and this will require your data to be decrypted.
For example, if you run a query using BigQuery, the BigQuery
service needs to decrypt your data to be able to analyze it. BigQuery
accomplishes this by making a decryption request to the key manager to get the
required data.
Why would my keys be accessed?
Your encryption keys are most often accessed by automated systems while
servicing your own requests and workloads on Google Cloud.
In addition to customer-initiated accesses and automated system accesses, a
Google employee might need to initiate operations which use your encryption keys
for the following reasons:
Back up your data : Google might need to access your encryption keys to
back up your data for disaster recovery reasons.
Resolve a support request : A Google employee might need to decrypt your
data to fulfill the contractual obligation of providing support.
Manage and troubleshoot systems : Google personnel can initiate operations
which use your encryption keys to perform technical debugging needed for a
complex support request or investigation. Access might also be needed to
remediate storage failure or data corruption.
Ensure data integrity and compliance, and protect against fraud and abuse :
Google might need to decrypt data for the following reasons:
To ensure the safety and security of your data and accounts.
To make sure that you are using Google services in compliance with
the Google Cloud Terms of Service .
To investigate complaints by other users and customers, or other signals of
abusive activity.
To verify that Google Cloud services are being used in accordance with
applicable regulatory requirements, such as anti-money laundering
regulations.
Maintain system reliability : Google personnel can request access to
investigate that a suspected service outage doesn't affect you. Also, access
might be requested to ensure backup and recovery from outages or system
failures.

justification reason codes for Key Access Justifications .
Managing access to your keys
Key Access Justifications provides a reason every time your Cloud KMS-managed keys
or externally managed keys are accessed. When your key is used for any
cryptographic operation, you receive a justification for both service-based
access (for supported services) and direct API access.
After your key projects are enrolled in Key Access Justifications, you immediately begin
receiving justifications for every key access for new keys. For previously
existing keys, you will begin receiving justifications for every key access
within 24 hours.
Enabling Key Access Justifications
Key Access Justifications can only be used with Assured Workloads, and is enabled by
default when you create a new Assured Workloads folder configured for
a control package that includes Key Access Justifications. See the
Assured Workloads overview for more
information.
Note: It can take up to 24 hours to enable Key Access Justifications with external key
managers after you've created your Assured Workloads folder. Therefore,
we recommend that you don't reject key access requests in production
environments during this time. There is no delay when using
non-external Cloud KMS keys.
Key Access Justifications exclusions
Key Access Justifications only applies to the following situations:
Operations on encrypted data : For the fields within a given service that
are encrypted by a customer-managed key, refer to the service's documentation.
The transition from data-at-rest to data-in-use : While Google continues to
apply protections to your data-in-use, Key Access Justifications only governs the
transition from data-at-rest to data-in-use.
The following Compute Engine and Persistent Disk features are exempted when used
with CMEK:
Local SSDs
Automatic restart
Machine image operations
Key Access Justifications with Access Approval
For workloads with Access Approval enabled with a custom signing key,
Key Access Justifications will also apply to processing signed access approval requests.
Access Approval requests can only be processed if the associated
justification for the key access associated is also permitted by the key's
Key Access Justifications policy. When a customer signs an Access Approval request,
the associated justification is reflected in the signing request for the
approval.
All Customer Data accesses that occur from an approved, signed access approval
request will appear in Access Transparency logs linked to the approval request.
