This page describes how to enforce SSL/TLS encryption for an instance to ensure
that all connections are encrypted. You can also
learn more about how Cloud SQL uses self-managed SSL/TLS certificates
to connect to Cloud SQL instances securely.
Overview
Cloud SQL creates a server certificate
automatically when you create your instance. We recommend that you
enforce all connections to use SSL/TLS .
To validate client/server identity using SSL/TLS certs, you need to create a
client certificate and download the certificates to your MySQL client
host machine.
Note: Cloud SQL recommends mutual
authentication, which involves using certificates to authenticate both the
client and server. Enforcing SSL/TLS encryption with valid client certificates
makes mutual TLS required for all clients. However, if SSL/TLS is not
enforced with valid client certificates, then connecting with non-mutual TLS using
the server certificate is still possible.
For more information, consult the documentation for your database engine .
If you enforce SSL for an instance, then the instance requires a restart.
A restart might also be required after you change SSL/TLS certificates.
When a restart is required, Cloud SQL automatically restarts the instance for you.
The restart of an instance can incur downtime.
Enforce SSL/TLS encryption
You can use the SSL mode
setting to enforce SSL encryption in the following ways:
Allow both non-SSL/non-TLS
and SSL/TLS connections.
The client certificate
isn't verified for SSL/TLS connections. This is the default.
Only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS.
The client certificate isn't
verified for SSL connections.
Only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid
client certificates.
If you select Allow non-SSL/non-TLS and SSL/TLS connections for your
Cloud SQL instance, SSL/TLS connections are
accepted, as well as unencrypted and unsecure connections.
If you do not require SSL/TLS for all connections, unencrypted
connections are still allowed.
For this reason, if you are accessing
your instance using public IP, we strongly recommend that you enforce SSL
for all connections.
You can connect either directly to instances by using SSL/TLS certificates, or
you can connect by using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
or Cloud SQL Connectors .
If you connect by using Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or Cloud SQL Connectors, then the connections
are automatically encrypted with SSL/TLS. With Cloud SQL Auth Proxy and Cloud SQL Connectors,
client and server identities are also automatically verified regardless of the
SSL mode setting.
Note: We recommend that you update instances using SSL mode instead of using the legacy require-ssl parameter.
If you update the SSL enforcement configuration on an existing instance,
make sure that the values don't conflict with the require-ssl parameter.
To enable requiring SSL/TLS, do the following:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Click Connections from the SQL navigation menu.
Select the Security tab.
Select one of the following:
Allow unencrypted network traffic (not recommended)
Allow only SSL connections. This option only allows
connections using SSL/TLS encryption. Certificates aren't
validated.
Require trusted client certificates. This option only
allows connections from clients that use a valid client certificate
and are SSL encrypted.
gcloud
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME \
--ssl-mode= SSL_ENFORCEMENT_MODE
Replace SSL_ENFORCEMENT_MODE with one of the following
options:
ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED allows non-SSL/non-TLS and
SSL/TLS connections. For SSL connections, the client certificate is not
verified. This is the default value.
ENCRYPTED_ONLY only allows connections encrypted with
SSL/TLS. The client certificate isn't verified for SSL connections.
TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED only allows
connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid client certificates.
For more information, see
Settings for Cloud SQL for MySQL .
Terraform
To enforce SSL/TLS encryption, use a Terraform resource :
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "mysql_instance" {
name = "mysql-instance"
region = "asia-northeast1"
database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
settings {
tier = "db-f1-micro"
ip_configuration {
# The following SSL enforcement options only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with
# valid client certificates. Please check the API reference for other SSL enforcement options:
# https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/admin-api/rest/v1beta4/instances#ipconfiguration
ssl_mode = "TRUSTED_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED"
}
}
# set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by
# use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.
deletion_protection = false
}
Apply the changes
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module ).
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension—for example main.tf . In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete!" message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Delete the changes
To delete your changes, do the following:
To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the
deletion_protection argument to false .
deletion_protection = "false"
Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and
entering yes at the prompt:
terraform apply
Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following
command and entering yes at the prompt:
terraform destroy

Server certificates
Cloud SQL creates a server certificate automatically when you create your
instance. As long as the server certificate is valid, you don't need
to actively manage your server certificate .
Cloud SQL lets you select between three different
certificate authority (CA) hierarchies .
The CA hierarchy that you select becomes the server CA mode
of the instance. If you're using per-instance CA as the server CA mode for your
instance, then the server certificates have an expiration date of 10 years.
If you're using shared CA or customer-managed CA as the server CA mode of
your instance, then the server certificate has an expiration date of 1 year * .
After the expiration date, the server certificate is no longer valid, and clients
can no longer establish a secure connection to your instance using that certificate.
If a client is configured to verify the CA or verify the hostname in the server
certificate, then that client's connections to Cloud SQL instances with
expired server certificates will fail. To prevent disruption to client connections,
enable automatic server certificate rotation or manually
rotate the server certificate before the certificate expires. You're
periodically notified that the server certificate is nearing expiration. The
notifications are sent the following number of days before the expiration date:
90, 30, 10, 2, and 1.
* For customer-managed CA, the expiration date of your server
certificate might be shorter than 1 year if you selected a
shorter expiration date for the validity period of your CA.
List and create server certificates
To view the details of your server certificates in the Google Cloud console,
go to the Connections page and click the
Security tab.
In the certificates table, you can see the following details:
Certificate Status :Upcoming, Active, or Previous
Upcoming : The certificate is available for use, but isn't
active. To make the certificate active, use the rotate procedure.
Active : The certificate is in use.
Previous : The certificate is no longer in use.
To make the certificate active, use the rollback procedure.
Created : The date and time the certificate was created
Expires : The date and time the certificate expires
Before the active certificate expires, you can create a new certificate manually.
Console
For instances that use self-signed server certificates (per-instance CA) :
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Click Connections from the SQL navigation menu.
Select the Security tab.
Go to the Manage server CA certificates section.
Click to expand Manage certificates .
Click Create new CA certificate .
The new server CA certificate appears in the Upcoming slot. If you want to rotate to the new server CA certificate immediately, proceed with server CA certificate rotation by updating your clients and completing the rotation.
For instances that use server certificates issued by a shared CA :
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Click Connections from the SQL navigation menu.
Select the Security tab.
Go to the Manage server certificates section.
Click to expand Manage certificates .
Click Create server certificate .
The new server certificate appears in the Upcoming slot. If you want to use the new server certificate immediately, proceed with server certificate rotation by updating your clients and completing the rotation.
gcloud
For instances that use self-signed server certificates (per-instance CA) :
To get information about the server certificate, use the sql ssl server-ca-certs list command:
gcloud sql ssl server-ca-certs list \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME
To create a server certificate, use the sql ssl server-ca-certs create command:
gcloud sql ssl server-ca-certs create \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME
Download the certificate information to a local PEM file:
gcloud sql ssl server-ca-certs list \
--format = "value(cert)" \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME > \
FILE_PATH / FILE_NAME .pem
Update all of your clients to use the new information by
copying the downloaded file to your client host machines, replacing the
existing server-ca.pem files.
For instances that use server certificates issued by a shared CA :
To get information about the server certificate, use the
sql ssl server-certs list command:
gcloud sql ssl server-certs list \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME
To create a server certificate, use the sql ssl server-certs create command:
gcloud sql ssl server-certs create \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME
Download the certificate information to a local PEM file:
gcloud sql ssl server-certs list \
--format = "value(ca_cert.cert)" \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME > \
FILE_PATH / FILE_NAME .pem
Update all of your clients to use the new information by
copying the downloaded file to your client host machines, replacing the
existing server-ca.pem files.
Terraform
To provide server certificate information as an output, use a Terraform data source :
Add the following to your Terraform configuration file:
data "google_sql_ca_certs" "ca_certs" {
instance = google_sql_database_instance.default.name
}
locals {
furthest_expiration_time = reverse(sort([for k, v in data.google_sql_ca_certs.ca_certs.certs : v.expiration_time]))[0]
latest_ca_cert = [for v in data.google_sql_ca_certs.ca_certs.certs : v.cert if v.expiration_time == local.furthest_expiration_time]
}
output "db_latest_ca_cert" {
description = "Latest CA certificate used by the primary database server"
value = local.latest_ca_cert
sensitive = true
}
To create the server-ca.pem file, run the following command:
terraform output db_latest_ca_cert > server-ca.pem
Client certificates
Create a new client certificate
You can create up to 10 client certificates for each instance. To create client
certificates, you must have the Cloud SQL Admin IAM role .
Here are some important things to know about client certificates:
If you lose the private key for a certificate, you must create a new one; the private key cannot
be recovered.
By default, the client certificate has an expiration date of 10 years.
You are not notified when client certificates are nearing expiration.
Your Cloud SQL instance must be in the running state to create a SSL certificate.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Click Connections from the SQL navigation menu.
Select the Security tab.
Click Create client certificate .
In the Create a client certificate dialog, add a unique
name.
Click Create .
In the first section of the New SSL certificate created
dialog, click Download client-key.pem to download the private
key to a file named client-key.pem .
Important: Store this private key securely. If you lose it, you must
create a new client certificate.
In the second section, click Download client-cert.pem to download
the client certificate to a file named client-cert.pem .
In the third section, click Download server-ca.pem to download
the server certificate to a file named server-ca.pem .
Click Close .
gcloud
Create a client certificate using the
ssl client-certs create command:
gcloud sql ssl client-certs create CERT_NAME client-key.pem \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME
Important: Store this private key securely. If you lose it, you must
create a new client certificate.
Retrieve the public key for the certificate you just created
and copy it into the client-cert.pem file with the
ssl client-certs describe
command:
gcloud sql ssl client-certs describe CERT_NAME \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--format = "value(cert)" > client-cert.pem
Copy the server certificate into the server-ca.pem file
using the
instances describe
command:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME \
--format = "value(serverCaCert.cert)" > server-ca.pem
Terraform
To create a client certificate, use a Terraform resource :
resource "google_sql_ssl_cert" "mysql_client_cert" {
common_name = "mysql_common_name"
instance = google_sql_database_instance.mysql_instance.name
}

At this point, you have:
A server certificate saved as server-ca.pem .
A client public key certificate saved as client-cert.pem .
A client private key saved as client-key.pem .
Depending on which tool you use to connect, these three items are specified
in different ways. For example, when connecting using MySQL client, these three
files are the values for the --ssl-ca , --ssl-cert , and
--ssl-key command options, respectively. For a sample connection
using MySQL client and SSL/TLS,
see
Connecting with MySQL Client .
Server identity verification
Server identity verification depends on the server
certificate authority (CA) hierarchy
configuration of your Cloud SQL instance.
For instances that use a per-instance CA, verifying the CA also
verifies the server identity since each instance has a unique CA.
For instances that use a shared CA,
verifying the hostname along with verifying the CA is required for server
identity verification since server CAs are shared across instances.
If you have per-instance CA, then you can perform DNS name-based server
identity verification only for instances that are configured with
Private Service Connect.
If you have a shared CA, then you can
perform DNS name-based server identity verification for all types of instances,
namely Private Service Connect ,
private service access ,
and public IP instances.
If you're using a customer-managed CA, then you can verify the
CA trust chain and perform DNS name-based server identity verification
for any type of instance that uses
customer-managed CA for its serverCAmode .
When you select the customer-managed CA option for your instance, you
can insert custom DNS names in the SAN field of
the server certificate. For more information,
see Edit a custom SAN field .
You can view which CA hierarchy is configured for a Cloud SQL instance by
viewing instance details. For more information, see View instance information .
Enable server identity verification
If you select shared CA as the server CA mode of your Cloud SQL
instance or if you set up custom DNS names using custom SAN values , then we recommend that
you also enable server identity verification.
Instances that use shared CA as
the server CA mode contain the instance DNS name in the
Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of the server certificate. You can get this
DNS name by using the instance lookup API and using the response as a hostname
for server identity verification. You need to set up DNS resolution for the DNS
name.
To enable server identity verification for an instance that uses a shared CA,
complete the following steps:
Retrieve the DNS name.
To view summary information about a Cloud SQL instance,
including the DNS name of the instance, use the
gcloud sql instances describe
command:
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Make the following replacements:
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the Cloud SQL instance
PROJECT_ID : the ID or
project number
of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance
In the response, look for the dnsNames: field.
This field can return multiple DNS names, which have the following formats:
Network configuration
DNS name format
Name level
Private Service Connect or Public IP address
INSTANCE_UID . PROJECT_DNS_LABEL . REGION_NAME .sql.goog.
Example :
1a23b4cd5e67.1a2b345c6d27.us-central1.sql.goog.
Instance
Private services access
INSTANCE_UID . PROJECT_DNS_LABEL . REGION_NAME .sql-psa.goog.
Example :
1a23b4cd5e67.1a2b345c6d27.us-central1.sql-psa.goog.
Instance
Create the DNS record in a DNS zone .
If you are connecting privately, then
create the DNS record in a private DNS zone
in the corresponding Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.
When you connect to the Cloud SQL for MySQL instance, configure the DNS name as the
hostname. Then enable server identity
verification in your client.
For example, when using the MySQL client, specify the flag
--ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY . Other MySQL client drivers have similar configuration
flags.
