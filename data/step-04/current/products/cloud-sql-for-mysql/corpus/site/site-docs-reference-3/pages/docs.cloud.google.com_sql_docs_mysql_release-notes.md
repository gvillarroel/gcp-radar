Feature
The QueryData tool lets you to query the data in your database using conversational language and build data agents. For more information, see QueryData tool overview . This feature is available in ( Preview ).
The preview release increases the accuracy of SQL generation with value search queries which match values and their context within a database. Value search queries trigger automatically.
Feature
If the storage capacity of a Cloud SQL instance is larger than your application
needs, then you can manually reduce, or shrink, your storage capacity to a smaller
size.
Depending on underlying disk size, storage shrink operations might incur
considerable downtime. If your instance requires limited downtime, rather than
using storage shrink capabilities, we recommend migrating your data to a new,
smaller instance using Database Migration Service.

Feature
To help prevent out-of-memory (OOM) events, you can enable managed buffer pool
for Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.0 and later instances. When you enable managed buffer
pool, Cloud SQL reduces the value of the
innodb_buffer_pool_size configuration and frees up memory when memory usage
is high, and the instance is in danger of an OOM event.
After memory usage stabilizes at a lower value, MySQL increases the
value of innodb_buffer_pool_size incrementally to its original value.
To enable managed buffer pool, your Cloud SQL instance must use a
maintenance version of [$MYSQL_VERSION].R20251004.01_07
or later. You can't enable managed buffer pool for instances that use a
shared core or for instances that are running MySQL 5.6 or MySQL 5.7.
For more information, see Enable managed buffer pool .
Support for managed buffer pool is in Preview .

Allowed number of client connections to the read pool
November 13, 2025
Feature
Cloud SQL for MySQL now lets you have more control over the number of results
that are returned when you perform an ANN vector search with filters.
You can use iterative filtering when the selective filters of the
WHERE clause in your ANN search query produce fewer results
than the number of results specified in your LIMIT clause.
To enable iterative filtering for your ANN search query, set the
cloudsql_vector_iterative_filtering flag to ON .
You can set the flag at a session or global level.
To enable and use iterative filtering for your ANN search query, you must have
[MYSQL_$VERSION].R20251004.01_07
or later installed on your MySQL instance.
For more information, see Search approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) .
