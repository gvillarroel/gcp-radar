This page describes how committed use discounts work with Cloud SQL.
What are Cloud SQL committed use discounts?
Committed use discounts (CUDs) for Cloud SQL provide deeply discounted
prices in exchange for your commitment to continuously use database instances in
a particular region for a one- or three-year term.
Cloud SQL CUDs are ideal for workloads with predictable
resource needs. You commit to a consistent amount of usage, measured in cost per
hour of equivalent on-demand spending, for a one- or three-year term. In
exchange, you receive a discounted rate for Google Cloud SQL on the
applicable usage your commitment covers.
Note : This document discusses some spend-based committed use discounts (CUDs) that
automatically migrate to a new consumption model, which leverages discounts rather than credits.
The migration date is indicated by a notification in the Google Cloud console Billing Overview
page. For more information about the improvements, the affected CUDs, and any required actions on
your part, see Spend-based CUDs .
You can purchase CUDs from any Cloud Billing
account, and the discount applies to any eligible usage in projects that the
Cloud Billing account pays for. When you purchase a Cloud SQL
CUD, you pay the same commitment fee for the entirety of the
commitment term, even if the price of applicable usage changes. You still
receive the same discount percentage on applicable usage in the event of a price
change. The commitment fee is billed monthly.
IMPORTANT: Any overage in usage is charged at
the on-demand rate.
For more information about your bill, see Analyze the effectiveness of your
spend-based committed use discounts .
What types of usage are Cloud SQL CUDs used for?
CUDs automatically apply to aggregate Cloud SQL instance
usage in a region, giving you low, predictable costs, without the need to make
any manual changes or updates yourself. This flexibility helps you achieve high
utilization rates across your commitments, saving you time and money.
Cloud SQL CUDs apply to all Cloud SQL database
instance CPU and memory usage in the region in which you have committed,
except shared CPU machine types (such as db-f1-micro and db-g1-small).
Cloud SQL CUDs apply to usage from all supported
databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server). Cloud SQL CUDs do not
apply to storage, backups, IP Addresses, outbound data transfer, or licensing.
Cloud SQL CUDs automatically apply to both Cloud SQL Enterprise edition and Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition
instances within the same region.
Pricing
25% discount : You get this by committing to a 1-year term. For the duration of your term, you pay the Cloud SQL CUD 1-year price (consumption model ID 61F8-639B-D89C) as your committed hourly spend amount.
52% discount : You get this by committing to a 3-year term. For the duration of your term, you pay the Cloud SQL CUD 3-year price (consumption model ID 52FB-D69D-95BE) as your committed hourly spend amount.
This discount significantly reduces Cloud SQL costs. These discount percentages are the same in every region.

See committed use discount pricing for pricing
details.
Purchase Cloud SQL CUDs
After your purchase a CUD, you cannot cancel your commitment. Make sure the
size and duration of your commitment aligns with both your historical and your
expected minimum expenditure on Cloud SQL for MySQL capacity. For more
information, see
Cancelling commitments .
To purchase or manage Cloud SQL for MySQL committed use discounts for your
Cloud Billing account, follow the instructions at
Purchasing spend-based
commitments .
Example use case
Key points to keep in mind:
Cloud SQL CUDs apply only to vCPUs and memory.
Cloud SQL CUDs do not apply to storage, backups,
IP Addresses, network egress, or licensing.
Cloud SQL CUDs apply to all instances in a given
region.
Cloud SQL CUDs are measured in dollars per hourly
on-demand commitment .
Cloud SQL CUDs can be applied to both Cloud SQL Enterprise edition and Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition .
If you have an existing CUD with a Cloud SQL Enterprise edition instance and want to upgrade
the instance to Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition, then your existing CUD can be applied to cover
all or part of the cost of the newly upgraded instance.
How to calculate an hourly on-demand commitment
When calculating the hourly rate for vCPUs and memory across all
instances in the region where you want to benefit from a CUD, first consider
whether it saves money for your situation. Any usage higher than that limit is
charged at the regular on-demand price.
For example:
Assume you are running 100 instances in each of two different regions. The
instances are using 2 high availability (HA) vCPUs with 7.5GB HA RAM, and are
located in region us-central1 and Singapore asia-southeast1 . You're interested in buying a 1-year CUD.
In the legacy CUDs program, your commitment amount is the on-demand price instead. For more information about the differences between the legacy and new spend-based CUDs program, see
Improvements to the spend-based CUDs program .
From the pricing table , you can calculate the approximate hourly one-year commitment cost as follows:
us-central1
100 * 2x HA vCPU * ($0.0826 per vCPU - 25% discount) per hour = ~$12.39 per hour
100 * 7.5GB HA RAM * ($0.0140 per GB - 25% discount) per hour = ~$7.875 per hour
For a total of $20.27 per hour in discounted committed use hourly pricing
asia-southeast1
100 * 2x HA vCPU * ($0.1156 per vCPU - 25% discount) per hour = ~$17.34 per hour
100 * 7.5GB HA RAM * ($0.0735 per GB - 25% discount) per hour = ~$11.025 per hour
For a total of $28.37 per hour in discounted committed use hourly pricing
Calculating the monthly cost (730 hours in a month):
us-central1
On-demand pricing = ($26.50 per hour * 730 hours) = $19,345 per month
After 25% 1-year CUD discount = ~$14,508 per month
For a total savings of ~$4,837 per month
asia-southeast1
On-demand pricing = ($35 per hour * 730 hours) = $25,550 per month
After 25% 1-year CUD discount = ~$19,162 per month
For a total savings of ~$6,388 per month
Once you make the commitment, you're charged that amount even if you decide to
stop or scale down the actual number of vCPUs or RAM during the month.
Final recommendations
When making the decision on whether to purchase CUDs, keep in
mind the following considerations:
Regions: Purchase CUDs for regions. If you're running in multiple
regions, calculate and purchase CUDs in each region separately.
Projects: Determine the consistent baseline vCPU/RAM usage per project.
Consider that production loads usually run 100% of the time, while development
or staging environments are usually run more intermittently.
Instances: Cloud SQL instances are usually run 24/7, so it's common to
buy CUDs for 100% consumption. If you have instances that are run only for
bursts or shorter durations, exclude them from your calculations, and pay
on-demand rates for those instances.
Machine types: CUDs are not tied to any machine type, but are just the
total of vCPUs and amount of memory used in the region.
