Connect from Cloud Run functions

| SQL Server
This page contains information and examples for connecting to a
Cloud SQL instance from a service running in Cloud Run functions.
For step-by-step instructions on running a Cloud Run functions sample web
application connected to Cloud SQL, see the
quickstart for connecting
from Cloud Run functions .
Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that helps you set up,
maintain, manage, and administer your relational databases in the cloud.
Cloud Run functions is
a lightweight compute solution for developers to create single-purpose,
standalone functions that respond to Cloud events without the need to manage
a server or runtime environment.
Set up a Cloud SQL instance
Enable the Cloud SQL Admin API in the Google Cloud project that you are connecting from, if you
haven't already done so:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Create a Cloud SQL
for MySQL instance . We recommend that you choose a Cloud SQL
instance location in the same region as your Cloud Run service for better latency, to avoid some networking costs, and to reduce
cross region failure risks.
By default, Cloud SQL assigns a public IP address to a new
instance.
You also have the option to assign a private IP address. For more
information about the connectivity options for both, see the
Connecting Overview
page.
When you create the instance, you can choose the
server certificate (CA) hierarchy for the instance and then configure the hierarchy
as the serverCaMode for the instance. You must select the
per-instance CA option ( GOOGLE_MANAGED_INTERNAL_CA ) as the server CA mode
for instances that you want to connect to from
web applications.
Configure Cloud Run functions
The steps to configure Cloud Run functions depend on the type of
IP address that you assigned to your Cloud SQL instance.
Public IP (default)
To configure Cloud Run functions to enable connections to a Cloud SQL
instance:
Confirm that the instance created above has a public IP address. You can
confirm this on the Overview page for the instance in the
Google Cloud console . If you
need to add a public IP address, see
Configure public IP .
Get the instance's INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME . This value is
available:
On the Overview page for the instance, in the
Google Cloud console , or
By running the following command:
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
Configure the service account for your function. If the authorizing
service account belongs to a different project from the Cloud SQL
instance, then you must enable the Cloud SQL Admin API, and add the Cloud SQL
Client IAM role to both projects.
Confirm that the
service account has this role so that the account can connect to Cloud SQL.
If you're using
Cloud Run functions and not Cloud Run functions (1st gen) , the
following are required (also see
Configure Cloud Run ):
Initially deploy your function.
When you first begin creating a Cloud Run function in the
Google Cloud console, the underlying Cloud Run
service hasn't been created yet. You can't configure a
Cloud SQL connection until that service is created (by deploying
the Cloud Run function).
In the Google Cloud console, in the upper right of the
Function details page, under Powered by Cloud Run , click the
link to access the underlying Cloud Run service.
On the Cloud Run Service details page, select the
Edit and deploy new revision tab.
Follow the
standard steps
(as in the case of any configuration
change) for setting a new configuration for a Cloud SQL connection.
This creates a new Cloud Run revision, and subsequent revisions
automatically receive this Cloud SQL connection, unless you
explicitly change it.
Private IP
If the authorizing service account belongs to a different project than the
one containing the Cloud SQL instance, do the following:
In both projects, enable the Cloud SQL Admin API.
For the service account in the project that contains the Cloud SQL instance, add the IAM permissions .
A Serverless VPC Access connector uses private IP addresses to
handle communication to your VPC network.
To connect directly with private IP addresses, you must do the following:
Make sure that the Cloud SQL instance created previously has a
private IP address. If you need to add one, see
Configure private IP
for instructions.
Create
a Serverless VPC Access connector in the same VPC
network as your Cloud SQL instance. Note the following conditions:
Unless you're using
Shared VPC , your connector must be in the same project and
region as the resource that uses it, but it can send traffic to resources in
different regions.
Serverless VPC Access supports communication to
VPC networks connected using Cloud VPN
and VPC Network Peering .
Serverless VPC Access doesn't support legacy networks .
Configure Cloud Run functions to use the connector.
Connect using your instance's private IP address and port 3306 .
Connect to Cloud SQL
After you configure Cloud Run functions, you can connect to your
Cloud SQL instance.
Public IP (default)
For public IP paths, Cloud Run functions can be set up to use the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy for encryption
in two ways:
Through Unix sockets
By using a Cloud SQL connector
Connect with Unix sockets
Once correctly configured, you can connect your service to your Cloud SQL
instance's Unix domain socket accessed on the environment's filesystem
at the following path:
/cloudsql/ INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME .
The INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME uses the format
project:region:instance-id . You can find it
on the Overview page for your instance in the
Google Cloud console or by running the
following command:
gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]
These connections are automatically encrypted without any additional
configuration.
The code samples shown below are extracts from more complete examples on
the
GitHub site. Click View on GitHub to see more.
Warning: Linux-based operating systems have a
maximum socket path length of 108 characters. If the total length of the
path exceeds this length, you cannot connect with a socket from
Cloud Run functions.

Best practices and other information
You can use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy when testing
your application locally. See the
quickstart for using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
for detailed instructions.
Connection Pools
Connections to underlying databases may be dropped, either by the database
server itself, or by the infrastructure underlying Cloud Run functions. We
recommend using a client library that supports connection pools that
automatically reconnect broken client connections.
Additionally, we recommend using a globally scoped connection pool to
increase the likelihood that your function reuses the same connection for
subsequent invocations of the function, and closes the connection naturally when
the instance is evicted (auto-scaled down).
For more detailed examples on how to use connection pools, see
Managing database connections .
Connection Limits
Cloud SQL imposes a maximum limit on concurrent connections, and these limits
may vary depending on the database engine chosen (see
Cloud SQL Quotas and Limits ).
It's recommended to use a connection with Cloud Run functions, but it is important
to set the maximum number of connections to 1.
Note: Cloud Run functions limits concurrent executions to
one per instance. You never have a situation where a single function instance
is processing two requests at the same time. In most situations, only a single
database connection is needed.
Where possible, you should take care to only initialize a connection pool for
functions that need access to your database. Some connection pools will create
connections preemptively, which can consume excess resources and count towards
your connection limits. For this reason, it's recommended to use
Lazy Initialization to delay the creation of a connection pool until
needed, and only include the connection pool in functions where it's used.
For more detailed examples on how to limit the number of connections, see
Managing database connections .
API Quota Limits
Cloud Run functions provides a mechanism that connects using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy,
which uses the Cloud SQL Admin API.
API quota limits apply to the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy. The Cloud SQL Admin API quota
used is approximately two times the number of Cloud SQL instances
configured times the total number of functions deployed. You can
set the
number of max concurrent invocations to modify the expected API quota
consumed. Cloud Run functions also imposes
rate limits on the number
of API calls allowed per 100 seconds.
