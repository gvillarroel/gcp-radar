Required roles and permissions
To get the permissions that
you need to create and manage a private services access connection,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Compute Network Admin ( roles/compute.networkAdmin )
IAM role on on the project where you plan to host your Cloud SQL instance.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to create and manage a private services access connection. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to create and manage a private services access connection:
compute.addresses.create
compute.addresses.list
compute.globalAddresses.create
compute.globalAddresses.createInternal
compute.globalAddresses.list
compute.networks.list
compute.networks.use
servicenetworking.services.addPeering
serviceusage.services.list
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Important: If you're using a Shared VPC network ,
then you need to enable the same APIs, add the same user, and provide the same
permissions to the user in the host project.
Private services access
When you create a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network in your
project, you need to
configure private services access
to allocate an IP address range and create a private services access connection. This
allows resources in the VPC network to connect to Cloud SQL
instances. The Google Cloud console provides a wizard to help you set
up this configuration.
Assigning different VPC networks to
Cloud SQL for MySQL instances with private IP addresses provides better isolation
than attaching all of them to the default VPC
network.
Configure an instance to use private IP
You can configure a Cloud SQL instance to use private IP when you create
the instance, or for an existing instance.
After you configure an instance to use private IP, you
cannot disable private IP connectivity for that instance.
If you choose to let Cloud SQL allocate your private IP for an
instance, the addresses for all instances you later configure in that VPC
network are automatically allocated in the same IP address range.
For each project, there's an internal limit for the number of different
network-region combinations in which Cloud SQL instances can be setup with
Private Services Access. To avoid reaching this limit, we recommend reusing
existing available networks.
Configure private IP for a new instance
To configure a Cloud SQL instance to use private IP when creating
an instance:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Click Create instance .
Expand Show configuration options .
Expand Connections .
Select Private IP .
A drop-down list shows the available VPC networks in your
project. If your project is the service project of a
Shared VPC ,
then VPC networks from the host project are also shown.
Select the VPC network you want to use.
If you see a message indicating that you need to set up a private service
connection, do the following:
Click Set up connection .
In the Allocate an IP range section, select one of the following
options:
Select one or more existing IP ranges or create a new one from the
dropdown. The dropdown includes previously allocated ranges, if there
are any, or you can select Allocate a new IP range and enter a
new range and name.
Use an automatically allocated IP range in your network .
Note: You can specify an address range only for
a primary instance, not for a read replica or clone.
Click Continue .
Click Create connection .
Verify that you see the message: Private service connection for
network VPC_NETWORK_NAME has been successfully
created .
Optionally, you can specify an allocated IP range for your instances to use for connections.
Expand Show allocated IP range option .
Select an IP range from the drop-down menu.
Optional. If you want to allow other Google Cloud services, such as
BigQuery, to access data in Cloud SQL and make queries against
this data over a private IP connection, then select Enable private
path .
Finish configuring your instance.
Click Create instance .
gcloud
Before you create an instance using a private IP address, ensure that your project is configured for
private services access .
Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:
INSTANCE_ID : The instance ID
PROJECT_ID : The project ID
NETWORK_PROJECT_ID : The project ID of the VPC network
Note: If the VPC network is a Shared VPC, then PROJECT_ID must be the ID of the Shared VPC service project, and NETWORK_PROJECT_ID must be
the ID of the Shared VPC host project.
VPC_NETWORK_NAME : The name of the VPC network
RANGE_NAME : Optional. If specified, sets a range name for which an IP range is allocated. The range name must comply with RFC-1035 and contain 1-63 characters.
REGION_NAME : The region name
To specify the name of your VPC network, use the --network parameter. To disable public IP, use the
--no-assign-ip flag.
Also, optionally, use the --enable-google-private-path parameter to allow other Google Cloud services such as
BigQuery to access data in Cloud SQL and make queries against this
data over a private IP connection. This parameter is valid only if:
You use the --no-assign-ip parameter.
You use the --network parameter to specify the name of the
VPC network that you want to use to create a private connection.
To enforce the use of the new network
architecture for the instance, use the --enforce-new-sql-network-architecture flag.
Make sure that you have allocated enough
IP addresses. When you use new network architecture enforcement before
a project is fully upgraded, you might experience instance
creation failure if sufficient IP address space isn't available.
For more information, see
Upgrade an instance to the new network architecture and Allocate an IP address range .
Note: After you create an instance, you can't
assign an allocated range name for that instance. After you assign a range to an
instance, you can't modify the range.

Terraform
To configure private IP for a new instance, use the following Terraform resources:
google_compute_network
google_compute_global_address
google_service_networking_connection
google_sql_database_instance
resource "google_compute_network" "peering_network" {
name = "private-network"
auto_create_subnetworks = "false"
}
resource "google_compute_global_address" "private_ip_address" {
name = "private-ip-address"
purpose = "VPC_PEERING"
address_type = "INTERNAL"
prefix_length = 16
network = google_compute_network.peering_network.id
}
resource "google_service_networking_connection" "default" {
network = google_compute_network.peering_network.id
service = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
reserved_peering_ranges = [google_compute_global_address.private_ip_address.name]
}
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "instance" {
name = "private-ip-sql-instance"
region = "us-central1"
database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
depends_on = [google_service_networking_connection.default]
settings {

private_network = google_compute_network.peering_network.id
}
}
# set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by
# use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.
deletion_protection = false
}
resource "google_compute_network_peering_routes_config" "peering_routes" {
peering = google_service_networking_connection.default.peering
network = google_compute_network.peering_network.name
import_custom_routes = true
export_custom_routes = true
}
## Uncomment this block after adding a valid DNS suffix
# resource "google_service_networking_peered_dns_domain" "default" {
# name = "example-com"
# network = google_compute_network.peering_network.name
# dns_suffix = "example.com."
# service = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
# }
Apply the changes
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module ).
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension—for example main.tf . In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete!" message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Delete the changes
To delete your changes, do the following:
To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the
deletion_protection argument to false .
deletion_protection = "false"
Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and
entering yes at the prompt:
terraform apply
Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following
command and entering yes at the prompt:
terraform destroy
REST v1
Create a new instance with a private IP address:
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID: The project ID
INSTANCE_ID: The instance ID
VPC_NETWORK_NAME: Specify the name of the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network that
you want to use for this instance. Private services access must already be configured for the
network.
RANGE_NAME: Optional. If specified, sets a range name for which an IP range
is allocated. The range name must comply with RFC-1035
and contain 1-63 characters.
AUTHORIZED_NETWORKS: For public IP connections, specify the connections from authorized
networks that can connect to your instance.
For the ipv4Enabled parameter, set the value to true
if you're using a public IP address for your instance or false if your instance has a
private IP address.
If you set the enablePrivatePathForGoogleCloudServices parameter to true ,
then you allow other Google Cloud services, such as BigQuery, to access data in
Cloud SQL and make queries against this data over a private IP connection. By setting this parameter to
false , other Google Cloud services can't access data in Cloud SQL over a private IP connection.
You can use the sqlNetworkArchitecture field to enforce the use of the new network
architecture for the instance upon creation, even if the project isn't fully upgraded.
For more details about the new network architecture and its implications, see
Upgrade an instance to the new network architecture and Allocate an IP address range .

Configure private IP for an existing instance
Configuring an existing Cloud SQL instance to use private IP
causes the instance to restart, resulting in downtime.
Note: You can't assign a private IP address for an existing Cloud SQL
instance in a Shared VPC network. You also can't assign an allocated
range name for an existing instance.
To configure an existing instance to use private IP:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Select Connections from the Cloud SQL navigation menu.
On the Networking tab, select the Private IP checkbox.
A drop-down list shows the available networks in your project.
Select the VPC network you want to use:
If you see Private service connection required :
Click Set up connection .
In the Allocate an IP range section, choose one of the following options:
Select one or more existing IP ranges or create a new one from the
dropdown. The drop down includes previously allocated ranges, if there
are any, or you can select Allocate a new IP range and enter a
new range and name.
Use an automatically allocated IP range in your network.
Note: You can specify an address range only for
a primary instance, not for a read replica or clone.
Click Continue .
Click Create connection .
Verify that you see the Private service connection for
network VPC_NETWORK_NAME has been successfully created
status.
Optional. If you want to allow other Google Cloud services, such as
BigQuery, to access data in Cloud SQL and make queries against
this data over a private IP connection, then select the Enable private
path check box.
Click Save .
gcloud
Ensure your project is configured for
private services access .
Update your Cloud SQL instance by using the
--network parameter
to specify the name of your selected VPC network.
To enforce the use of the new network
architecture for the instance when you add a private IP network
configuration, use the --enforce-new-sql-network-architecture flag.
Make sure that you have allocated enough
IP address space in your IP range.
When you use new network architecture enforcement before
a project is fully upgraded, you might experience instance
creation failure if sufficient IP address space isn't available.

REST v1beta4
Create a new instance with a private IP address:
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID: The project ID
INSTANCE_ID: The instance ID
VPC_NETWORK_NAME: Specify the name of the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network that
you want to use for this instance. Private services access must already be configured for the
network.
RANGE_NAME: Optional. If specified, sets a range name for which an IP range
is allocated. The range name must comply with RFC-1035
and contain 1-63 characters.
AUTHORIZED_NETWORKS : For public IP connections, specify the connections from authorized
networks that can connect to your instance.
For the ipv4Enabled parameter, set the value to true
if you're using a public IP address for your instance or false if your instance has a
private IP address.
If you set the enablePrivatePathForGoogleCloudServices parameter to true ,
then you allow other Google Cloud services, such as BigQuery, to access data in
Cloud SQL and make queries against this data over a private IP connection. By setting this parameter to
false , other Google Cloud services can't access data in Cloud SQL over a private IP connection.
You can use the sqlNetworkArchitecture field to enforce the use of the new network
architecture for the instance upon creation, even if the project isn't fully upgraded.
For more details about the new network architecture and its implications, see
Upgrade an instance to the new network architecture and Allocate an IP address range .

Connect to an instance using its Private IP
You use private services access
to connect to Cloud SQL instances from Compute Engine or Google Kubernetes Engine
instances in the same VPC network (defined here as internal
sources) or from outside of that network (an external source).
Connect from an internal source
To connect from a source in the same Google Cloud project as your Cloud SQL instance, such as the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy running on a
Compute Engine resource, that resource must be in the same VPC
network where private services access has been established for the
Cloud SQL instance.
To connect from a serverless source, such as App Engine standard environment ,
Cloud Run ,
or Cloud Run functions ,
your application or function connects directly to your instance through
Serverless VPC Access without the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
Connect from an external source
If an external network (for example, an on-premises network or a VPC
network), is connected to the VPC network to which your
Cloud SQL instance is connected, then you can use Cloud VPN
or Cloud Interconnect to connect
to the instance from a client in the external network.
To permit connections from an external network, do the following:
Ensure your VPC network is connected to the external
network using a
Cloud VPN tunnel or a VLAN attachment for
Dedicated Interconnect or
Partner Interconnect .
Ensure the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) sessions on the
Cloud Routers managing your Cloud VPN tunnels and
Cloud Interconnect attachments (VLANs) have received specific
prefixes (destinations) from your on-premises network.
Default routes (destination 0.0.0.0/0) cannot be imported into the
Cloud SQL VPC network because that network has its own
local default route. Local routes for a destination are used even
though the Cloud SQL peering is configured to import custom routes from
your VPC network.
Identify the peering connections produced by the private services
connection. Depending on the service, the private services connection might
create one or more of the following peering connections, but not necessarily all
of them:
cloudsql-mysql-googleapis-com
cloudsql-postgres-googleapis-com
servicenetworking-googleapis-com
Update all of the peering connections to enable Export custom
routes .
Identify the allocated range used by the private services connection.
Configure Cloud Router custom advertisement mode for the allocated
range on the Cloud Routers managing BGP sessions for your
Cloud VPN tunnels or Cloud Interconnect attachments (VLANs).
Note: If you're using a non-RFC 1918 IP address range for your application, then to allow access from this range, configure the authorized network for your instance.
Connect from Cloud Shell
Cloud Shell uses a Compute Engine
virtual machine that's managed by Google Cloud and is outside of your
VPC network. Therefore, a connectivity path doesn't exist between
Cloud Shell and the private IP address space of the your VPC
network.
As a result, Cloud Shell doesn't support connecting to a Cloud SQL
instance that has only a private IP address.
To connect to Cloud SQL instances from an external network using Private
IP connectivity, see
Connect to a Cloud SQL instance from outside its VPC .
Connect from non-RFC 1918 IP addresses
RFC 1918 specifies IP
addresses that are assigned to be used internally (that is, within an
organization) and will not route on the Internet. Specifically, these are:
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16
Connections to a Cloud SQL instance using a private IP address are
automatically authorized for RFC 1918
address ranges . This way, all private clients can access the database
without going through the proxy.
Note: You must configure all the non-RFC 1918 IP address ranges
as authorized networks of the
Cloud SQL for MySQL instances. Alternatively, you can connect to your instance
using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy client .
To connect from a non-RFC 1918 IP address, you must set
per-instance IP authorization to allow traffic from non-RFC 1918 IP address
ranges.
For example, use a gcloud command like the following:
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME \
--authorized-networks = 192 .88.99.0/24,11.0.0.0/24
Note: This command overwrites all existing authorized networks, so you must
include all desired authorized networks.
Cloud SQL doesn't learn non-RFC 1918 subnet routes from your
VPC network by default. You need to update the network peering to
Cloud SQL to export any non-RFC 1918 routes.
gcloud compute networks peerings update PEERING_CONNECTION \
--network = VPC_NETWORK_NAME \
--export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
PEERING_CONNECTION is the name of the peering connection produced by the private services
connection between your VPC network and the service producer network.
VPC_NETWORK_NAME is the name of your VPC network.
PROJECT_ID is the ID of the project of the VPC network.
If you're using Shared VPC, then use the host project ID.
To mitigate IP address exhaustion, you can use
privately used public IP addresses .
Connect from privately used public IP addresses
If you want to configure your instance in a privately used public IP address range, then enable
export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip on the network peering between your network
and the Cloud SQL network.
gcloud compute networks peerings update PEERING_CONNECTION \
--network = VPC_NETWORK_NAME \
--export-subnet-routes-with-public-ip \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
PEERING_CONNECTION is the name of the peering
connection produced by the private services
connection between your VPC network and the service producer network.
To know the name of the peering connection, go to the VPC network peering page.
VPC_NETWORK_NAME is the name of your VPC network.
PROJECT_ID is the ID of the project of the
VPC network. If you're using Shared VPC, then use the host project ID.
Connect to an instance configured with privately used public IP addresses
If your instance is configured in a privately used public IP address range
and you want to connect to it,
then enable import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip on the network peering
between your network and the Cloud SQL network.
gcloud compute networks peerings update PEERING_CONNECTION \
--network = VPC_NETWORK_NAME \
--import-subnet-routes-with-public-ip \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
PEERING_CONNECTION is the name of the peering connection produced by the private services
connection between your VPC network and the service producer network.
To know the name of the peering connection, go to the VPC network peering page.
VPC_NETWORK_NAME is the name of your VPC network.
PROJECT_ID is the ID of the project of the VPC network. Use the host project ID if you're using Shared VPC.
Connect by using a write endpoint
In addition to a private IP address, you can use a write endpoint in a SQL connection string. A write endpoint is a global domain name service (DNS) name that resolves to the IP address of the current primary instance automatically. By using a write endpoint, you can avoid having to make application connection changes when a region failure occurs.
If a replica failover or switchover occurs, then the write endpoint can help manage private IP addresses of instances. When this happens, use the write endpoint to connect to the instance that acts as the primary instance.
Note : A write endpoint is available only for Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition instances that have private IP addresses and associated networks. For more information on creating instances that meet this criteria, see Create instances .
How Cloud SQL creates a write endpoint
If you enable the Cloud DNS API for your Google Cloud project, and then you
create a primary Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition instance ,
promote the replica for the instance ,
or upgrade the instance from Cloud SQL Enterprise edition ,
Cloud SQL generates a write endpoint automatically and assigns it to
the instance.
If the primary instance changes during the switchover or failover processes,
then Cloud SQL assigns the write endpoint to the failover replica
because this replica is the new primary instance.
For more information, see
View the write endpoint .
Assign a write endpoint to an instance
If you don't enable the Cloud DNS API for your Google Cloud project, and then you
create, promote, or upgrade your instance, Cloud SQL doesn't assign the
write endpoint to the instance automatically.
To have Cloud SQL generate a write endpoint and assign it to the
instance, see Generate the write endpoint .
