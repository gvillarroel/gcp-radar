Google Cloud offers Identity and Access Management (IAM), which lets you give
access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevent unwanted
access to other resources. This page describes how Cloud SQL is integrated with
IAM
and how you can use IAM for managing access to Cloud SQL
resources and for database authentication.
For a detailed description of Google Cloud IAM, see
IAM documentation .
Cloud SQL provides a set of predefined roles
designed to help you control access to your Cloud SQL resources. You can
also create your own custom roles ,
if the predefined roles don't provide the sets of permissions you need.
In addition, the legacy basic roles (Editor, Viewer, and Owner) are also still
available to you, although they don't provide
the same fine-grained control as the Cloud SQL roles. In particular, the
basic roles provide access to resources across Google Cloud, rather than just
for Cloud SQL. For more information about basic Google Cloud roles, see
Basic roles .
You can set an IAM policy at any level in the
resource hierarchy : the
organization level, the folder level, or the project level.
Resources inherit the policies of all of their parent resources.

IAM authentication concepts
When using IAM authentication, permission to access a resource
(a Cloud SQL instance) isn't granted directly to the end user. Instead,
permissions are grouped into roles , and roles are granted to principals . For
more information, see the
IAM overview .
Administrators who have users log in through IAM database authentication can use
IAM authentication to centrally manage access control to their instances
using IAM policies.
IAM policies involve the following entities:
Principals . In Cloud SQL, you can use several
types of principals: a user account , a service account
(for applications), or a group .
For more information, see
Concepts related to identity .
Roles . A role is a collection of permissions. You can grant roles to
principals to provide them with the privileges required to accomplish
specific tasks.
For example, with IAM database authentication, a principal requires
the cloudsql.instances.login permission to log in to an instance, which is
included in the Cloud SQL Instance User role.
To get the permission, you bind the user, service account,
or group to the predefined Cloud SQL role or a custom role that
includes the permission. For more information about IAM roles,
see Roles .
Resource . The resources that principals access are Cloud SQL
instances. By default, IAM policy bindings are applied at the
project-level, such that principals receive role permissions for all
Cloud SQL instances in the project.
IAM database authentication
Database authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user who is
attempting to access databases. In Cloud SQL, you can use the following
types of database authentication for database users:
The database's built-in authentication
uses a username and password to authenticate a database user.
IAM database authentication uses IAM to authenticate a user by using an access
token. You have two options for managing users or service
accounts.
Individually : By default, when you use IAM database authentication, you grant
IAM roles and assign database privileges to individual
users and service accounts.
You add individual accounts to instances and manage the privileges of
each account separately.
By group : IAM group authentication lets you control
access to Cloud SQL instances at a group level.
For example, you can assign Identity and Access Management roles and database privileges
to a Cloud Identity group.
All the users and service accounts in the Cloud Identity
group inherit the IAM roles and database
privileges that are assigned to the group.
Note: If you're using Workforce Identity Federation ,
database authentication for user logins isn't supported for
Cloud SQL for MySQL
databases. For more information, see
Identity federation limitations .

IAM group authentication
IAM group authentication lets you manage Cloud SQL users at a group level. An example
of a group includes a Cloud Identity group .
This feature simplifies database user management. You can manage the Cloud SQL
IAM role or permissions for multiple accounts at once instead of
having to update each user or service account individually. You can also grant
and revoke the database privileges for a Cloud Identity group.
Any new accounts that you add to the Cloud Identity group inherit the
privileges of that group.
With IAM group authentication, you can do the following:
Add a user to a group and have the user inherit their IAM roles
and database privileges automatically.
Remove a user from a group to remove their login access and database
privileges from Cloud SQL databases.
Grant login or database privileges to a group a single time instead of
having to grant the same privileges multiple times to different users.
Remove login permissions or access to a database object for a group all
at once.
Even though IAM roles and permissions are assigned at the
group level, users and service accounts use their individual
IAM accounts and credentials and not a shared group account to
log in. Cloud SQL creates a database account on the instance for that user
or service account after their first login.
Individual login and database
activity for each user or service account appears in audit logs. For
auditing purposes, you get the benefit of viewing which account performed which
action in your database.
For more information about working with Cloud Identity groups, see the
Overview of Cloud Identity .
When you add a user or service account to a group, the
following changes in Cloud SQL occur:
If you have already given IAM login permissions to the group,
then the user or service account gains the ability to log in to the
Cloud SQL instance because the user or service account belongs to
the group.
The user automatically inherits any database privileges
that have been granted to the group.
Note: If you're adding an account that already has access to the
instance through individual IAM authentication, first
remove that IAM user or service account from the instance .
Then add the user or service account to the group.
When you remove a user or service account from the group, the following
changes in Cloud SQL occur:
The user loses any database privileges that were previously inherited by
being a member of the group.
The user might still be able login if they receive IAM login
permissions for the Cloud SQL instance through other group memberships.
However, the user won't have database privileges from their former group
membership upon logging in.
Note: Group membership changes take time to propagate. After a user has been
removed from a group, it can take some time to revoke their inherited group
database privileges.
IAM group authentication best practices
When you revoke the login permission ( cloudsql.instances.login )
for an IAM group in Cloud Identity,
make sure that you also delete the group from the Cloud SQL instance.
When you delete a group from a Cloud Identity, make sure that you also
delete that group from the Cloud SQL instance.
Use groups to configure role-based access control in your database. Always
provide the least required privileges to the group.
Don't grant IAM group authentication roles to built-in users. For example, if you
have a built-in user, user-a and create an IAM group authentication
user, user-b@example.com , then don't grant the
user-b@example.com role to user-a .
IAM group authentication restrictions
You can add a maximum of 200 IAM groups to an instance.
You can't add individual IAM user or service accounts
that belong to a group on the same instance. In other words, you can't add an
account with the type CLOUD_IAM_USER or CLOUD_IAM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
if an identical account with type CLOUD_IAM_GROUP_USER or
CLOUD_IAM_GROUP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT already exists.
If an individual account already exists on an instance with the
type CLOUD_IAM_USER or CLOUD_IAM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT ,
then the account can't be used for IAM group authentication. These user types
don't inherit IAM roles and database privileges from a group.
To fix this issue and use the account with IAM group authentication,
remove the individual IAM user or service account.
For more information, see
An existing IAM user or service account isn't inheriting the database privileges granted to their group .
Changes to Cloud Identity group membership, such as the addition of
an account, take about 15 minutes to propagate.
This is in addition to the time required for IAM changes .
Automatic versus manual IAM database authentication
Cloud SQL for MySQL has two options for IAM database authentication: automatic and manual.
Automatic IAM database authentication
Automatic IAM database authentication lets you hand off requesting and managing access tokens
to
an intermediary Cloud SQL connector ,
such as the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or one of the Cloud SQL Language Connectors. With automatic
IAM database authentication, users need to pass only the
IAM database username in a connection request from the client.
The connector submits the access token information for the password attribute on
behalf of the client.
Automatic IAM database authentication requires the use of a Cloud SQL connector and
is supported by the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy , the Go connector , the
Java connector , and the
Python connector .
For the most secure and reliable experience, we recommend you use automatic
IAM database authentication. IAM database authentication uses OAuth 2.0 access tokens, which are short-lived and
valid for only one hour. Cloud SQL connectors are able to request and refresh
these tokens, ensuring that long-lived processes or applications that rely on
connection pooling can have stable connections. Automatic IAM database authentication is strongly
recommended over manual authentication.
For more information, see Log in with automatic IAM database authentication .
Manual IAM database authentication
Manual IAM database authentication requires the IAM principal to explicitly pass
the access token for the password attribute in the client connection request.
Principals must first log in to Google Cloud and explicitly request the access
token from IAM.
Using the gcloud CLI , you can explicitly request an
OAuth 2.0 token with the
Cloud SQL Admin API scope that is used to log in to the database. When you log in as a
database user with IAM database authentication, you use your email address as the username and
the access token as the password. You can use this method with either a direct
connection to the database or with a Cloud SQL connector.
Warning: OAuth 2.0 access tokens are short lived
and are only valid for one hour. Any new connections or logins created after
this time fail. For this reason, we don't recommend that you use manual
IAM database authentication for long-lived processes or applications that rely on connection
pooling.
Logging in with IAM database authentication can only be performed over an SSL
connection.
For more information, see
Logging in with manual IAM database authentication .
Context-aware access and IAM database authentication
If you're using context-aware access
in your IAM configuration, then you can't use a
Cloud SQL connector such as the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or one of the
Cloud SQL Language Connectors with IAM database authentication. Attempts to login either manually or
automatically with IAM authentication will fail.
Connect directly to the instance instead.
User and service account administration
To provide users and service accounts access to databases on an instance using
IAM database authentication, you need to add them to the instance or add
them to a group that has access to the instance. For more information,
see Add a user or service account that uses IAM .
If you use the Google Cloud console to add users or service accounts, Cloud SQL
asks you to add the "Cloud SQL User" role to the user. This role is required
for users to log in to the instance.
After you've added the IAM user to the database, you need to grant database privileges
manually. Use the MySQL GRANT command to
grant other database privileges .
Instance configuration for Cloud SQL IAM database authentication
You can enable IAM database authentication on an instance using the cloudsql_iam_authentication
flag. Once you enable this flag, the instance enables logins from accounts that
are configured for IAM database authentication. This flag is enabled by default if you create
the instances using the Google Cloud console.
This flag is required for IAM group authentication and IAM database authentication.
Note: If a Cloud SQL instance already has an IAM user ( CLOUD_IAM_USER )
or service account ( CLOUD_IAM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT ) and you want to
switch the
account to use IAM group authentication ( CLOUD_IAM_GROUP_USER or
CLOUD_IAM_GROUP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT ), then you must
remove the existing IAM user or service account
from the instance first.
Setting the flag does not prevent existing, non-IAM users from
using their usernames and passwords to log in. However, if you disable this flag
on the instance, any user that you previously added using IAM database authentication loses
access to the instance. For more information, see
Configuring instances for IAM database authentication .
Cloud SQL IAM database authentication for different instance scenarios
Read replicas
IAM database authentication is not enabled in a read replica automatically, even when it
is enabled on the primary instance. After you create a read replica, you
need to add IAM database authentication. For more information, see
Configure read replica logins for IAM database authentication .
Restored instances
If an instance was previously backed up and later restored to the same or
a different instance in the same project, the current user login
authorizations apply. If you restore a backup to a new instance in another
project, you need to set up the user authorizations for the new instance. For
more information, see
Add a user or service account that uses IAM database authentication .
Point-in-time restored instances
If you perform a point-in-time restore within the same project, the
current user login authorizations apply for the target instance. If you
point-in-time restore an instance to a different project, you need to set
up the user authorizations for the new instance. For more information, see
Add a user or service account that uses IAM database authentication .
About IAM Conditions
IAM Conditions lets you grant
roles based on a variety of attributes. For example, you can allow
access only at certain dates and times or grant access only to
Cloud SQL resources with certain names.
For more information about IAM Conditions, see
the Overview of IAM Conditions
page. You can also learn more about
Using IAM Conditions
with Cloud SQL, including examples.
Work with Cloud Audit Logs
To keep records of data access, including logins, you can use audit logs.
Cloud Audit Logs is turned off, by default. You
need to turn on Data Access audit logs for
login tracking. Using audit logging for this purpose incurs costs for data
logging. For more information, see Audit Logs ,
Configuring Data Access audit logs
and Pricing for logging data .
Restrictions
The login for an IAM database authentication user account must be all lowercase. For example,
example-user@example.com . Example-User@example.com
is not allowed.
For security, logins using IAM database authentication are only available on an SSL
connection. Unencrypted connections are rejected.
There is a per-minute login quota for each instance, which includes both
successful and unsuccessful logins. When the quota is exceeded, logins are
temporarily unavailable. We recommend that you avoid frequent logins and
restrict logins using authorized networks .
The quota for authorization of logins is 12,000 per minute, per instance.
IAM database authentication is not supported for instances that use MySQL 5.6.
