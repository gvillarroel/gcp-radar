Cloud SQL organization policies

This page explain how to use an organization
policy with your Cloud SQL project. To get started creating
organization policies, see
Add organization policies .
Overview
Organization policies let organization administrators set restrictions on
how users can configure instances under that organization. Organization
policies use rules, called constraints, that the organization administrator
places on a project, folder, or organization. Constraints enforce the policy
across all instances. If, for example, you try to create an instance in an entity
that has an organization policy, the constraint runs a check to ensure the
instance configuration follows the requirements of the constraint. If the check
fails, Cloud SQL doesn't create the instance.
As you add projects to an organization or folder that uses an organization
policy, the projects inherit the constraints of that policy.
For more information about organization policies, see Organization Policy Service , Constraints , and
Hierarchy Evaluation .
The types of organization policies specific to Cloud SQL are as follows:
Predefined organization policies
Connection organization policies
Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) organization policies
Custom organization policies
Predefined organization policies
You can use the predefined constraints to control the public IP settings and Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) settings of Cloud SQL instances. For more granular, customizable control over other supported settings, you can use custom constraints. For more information, see custom organization policies .
Connection organization policies
Connection organization policies provide centralized control of the public IP
settings for Cloud SQL, to reduce the security attack surface of
Cloud SQL instances from the Internet. An organization policy
administrator can use a connection policy to restrict public IP configurations
of Cloud SQL at the project, folder, or organization level.
Connection organization policy constraints
For the connection organization policy, there are two types of predefined constraints that
enforce access to Cloud SQL instances. There are also
custom organization policies that
can be used to enforce connection organization policies.
For more information, see the ipConfiguration examples in example custom constraints .
Constraint
Description
Default behavior
Restrict public IP access on Cloud SQL instances
This boolean constraint restricts configuring public IP
on Cloud SQL instances where this constraint is set to
True . This constraint isn't retroactive. Cloud SQL
instances with existing public IP access still work even after this
constraint is enforced.
By default, public IP access to Cloud SQL instances is allowed.
constraints/sql.restrictPublicIp
Allowed
Restrict Authorized Networks on Cloud SQL instances
When set to True , this boolean constraint restricts
adding Authorized Networks for unproxied database access to
Cloud SQL instances. This constraint isn't retroactive.
Cloud SQL instances with existing Authorized Networks still work
even after this constraint is enforced. By default, you can add
Authorized Networks to Cloud SQL instances.
constraints/sql.restrictAuthorizedNetworks
Allowed
Restrictions for connection organization policies
When you set the organization policy for each project, you need to determine if
any one of the following apply to your project:
Read replicas public IP conflicts
Incompatibility using gcloud CLI sql connect
Google Cloud hosted services access
MySQL failover replica public IP conflicts
Non-RFC 1918 private IP addresses
Read replicas public IP address conflicts
Cloud SQL read replicas connect to the primary instance over the
non-proxied database connection. You use the primary instance
Authorized Networks setting to either explicitly or implicitly configure
the read replica public IP addresses.
If both the primary and replica instances are within the same region and enable
private IP, there's no conflict with connection organization policy constraints.
Incompatibility using gcloud sql connect
The gcloud sql connect command uses a public IP address to connect to
Cloud SQL instances directly. Therefore, it is incompatible with the
sql.restrictPublicIp constraint. This is generally a problem for
instances that use private IP.
In addition, the gcloud sql connect command doesn't use the proxy, making it
incompatible with the sql.restrictAuthorizedNetworks constraint.
Instead, use the beta version of the command:
gcloud beta auth login
gcloud beta sql connect [ INSTANCE_ID ]
This version uses the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy. See
gcloud beta sql connect for
reference information.
The first time you run this command, you are prompted to install the gcloud CLI
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy component. For that, you need to have write permission to
the gcloud CLI SDK installation directory on your client machine.
Google Cloud hosted services access
If your application requires access to Cloud SQL instances from other
Google Cloud hosted services, such as App Engine, the application must use public IP
addresses. Don't enforce the sql.restrictPublicIp
constraint on the project. You can, however, enforce
sql.restrictAuthorizedNetworks , as connections from
App Engine go through the secure (proxied) connection .
MySQL failover replica public IP conflicts
A MySQL failover replica acts the same as a read replica for connection
organization policies. If both the primary and replica instances are within the
same region and enable private IP, there's no conflict with connection
organization policy constraints.
Non-RFC 1918 private IP addresses
Connections to a Cloud SQL instance using a private IP address are
automatically authorized for RFC 1918
address ranges . This lets all private clients access the database without
going through the proxy. You must configure non-RFC 1918 address ranges as
authorized networks .
To use non-RFC 1918 private IP ranges that are not configured in
the authorized networks, you can take one or both of the following actions:
Don't enforce sql.restrictAuthorizedNetworks . If the authorized
networks also enforce sql.restrictPublicIp , you can't configure
them in the console. Instead, use the Cloud SQL API or the
gcloud CLI .
Use proxied connections for private IP instances.
Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) organization policies
Cloud SQL supports two organization policy constraints that help ensure
CMEK protection across an organization: constraints/gcp.restrictNonCmekServices
and constraints/gcp.restrictCmekCryptoKeyProjects .
The constraints/gcp.restrictNonCmekServices constraint requires CMEK
protection for the sqladmin.googleapis.com . When you add this constraint and
add the sqladmin.googleapis.com to the Deny policy list of services,
Cloud SQL refuses to create new instances unless they are enabled with
CMEK.
The constraints/gcp.restrictCmekCryptoKeyProjects constraint limits which
Cloud KMS CryptoKeys to use for CMEK protection in
Cloud SQL for MySQL instances. With this constraint, when Cloud SQL
creates a new instance with CMEK, the CryptoKey must come from an allowed
project, folder, or organization.
These constraints are only enforced on newly created Cloud SQL for MySQL
instances.
For more overview information, see
CMEK organization policies .
For information about CMEK organization policy constraints, see
Organization policy constraints .
Custom organization policies
For granular, customizable control over the settings, you can create custom constraints and use those custom
constraints in a custom organization policy. You can use custom organization policies to improve your security, compliance, and governance.
To learn how to create custom organization policies, see
Add custom organization policies . You can also view a list of supported fields for custom constraints .
Organization policy enforcement rules
Cloud SQL enforces the organization policy during the following
operations:
Instance creation
Replica creation
Instance restart
Instance migration
Instance clone
Like all organization policy constraints , policy changes don't apply retroactively to existing instances.
A new policy has no effect on existing instances.
An existing instance configuration remains valid, unless a user changes
the instance configuration from a compliance to non-compliance state
using the Console, gcloud CLI , or RPC.
A scheduled maintenance update doesn't cause a policy enforcement, because
maintenance doesn't change the configuration of instances.
