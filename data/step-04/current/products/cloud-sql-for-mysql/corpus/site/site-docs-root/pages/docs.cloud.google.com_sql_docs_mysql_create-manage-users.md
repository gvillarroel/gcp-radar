| SQL Server
This page describes how to enable and use Cloud SQL built-in authentication.
For an overview, see Cloud SQL built-in database authentication .
Before creating users
Create a Cloud SQL instance. For more information, see
Create instances .
Enable password policies for the instance. For more information, see Instance password policies .
If you plan to use your database's administrative client to manage users,
then do the following:
Connect the client to your instance.
See Connection options for external applications .
Configure the default user on the instance by setting the password.
See Set the password for the default user account .
Set the password for the default user account
When you create a new Cloud SQL instance, you must set a password for the
default user account before you can connect to the instance.
For Cloud SQL for MySQL, the default user is root@% This signifies a database user with a username of root which can connect from any host ( @% ).
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Select Users from the SQL navigation menu.
Find the root user and then select Change password
from the more actions menu .
Consider the listed stipulations for the password, which are derived from
the password policy
set for the instance.
Provide a strong password that you can remember and
click OK .
gcloud
Use the
gcloud sql users set-password command as follows to set the password for the default user.
Replace INSTANCE_NAME with the name of the instance before running
the command.
gcloud sql users set-password root \
--host = % \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--prompt-for-password
REST v1
To update the password for the default user account, use a PUT request with the
users:update method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
project-id : Your project ID
instance-id : The desired instance ID
password : The password for the user
HTTP method and URL:
PUT https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id /users?name=root&host=%25
Request JSON body:
{
"name": "root",
"password": " password "
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X PUT \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id /users?name=root&host=%25"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method PUT ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id /users?name=root&host=%25" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:

}
Create a user
After setting up the default user account , you can create other users.
Note: Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.0 uses mysql_native_password as the default
authentication plugin for new users instead of caching_sha2_password .
However, Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.4 uses caching_sha2_password for the
default authentication plugin for new users. For more
information, see MySQL authentication .
When you create a built-in user, you can assign the user with
one or more database roles.
To assign a custom database role to a user, you must
create the role in the MySQL database first.
To create a role in MySQL, see Using roles .
Console
Note : You can't assign
database roles to MySQL users by using the
Google Cloud console. To assign a database role or roles to a
MySQL user, use the gcloud CLI or the Cloud SQL Admin API instead.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Select Users from the SQL navigation menu.
Click Add user account .
In the Add a user account to instance instance_name page,
you can choose whether the user authenticates with the built-in database
method (username and password) or as an
IAM user .
Select Built-in authentication (the default) and add the
following information:
A User name .
Optional. A Password . Provide a strong password that you can remember.
Optional. The user password policy .
In the Host name section, the default is Allow any host ,
which means that the user can connect from any IP address. Optionally,
select Restrict host by IP address or address range
and enter an IP address or address range in the Host section.
The user can then connect only from the IP address or
addresses specified.
Click Add .
If you create a user that uses built-in authentication for a MySQL 8.0 or later instance and don't
specify any database roles, then the user is granted the cloudsqlsuperuser role automatically.
For more information about the privileges associated with the cloudsqlsuperuser role,
see MySQL 8.0 user privileges (cloudsqlsuperuser) and
MySQL 8.4 user privileges (cloudsqlsuperuser) .
If you want to change the privileges for the user, then assign one or more custom MySQL roles
when you create the user in Cloud SQL. If you assign one or more custom database roles
when you create the user in Cloud SQL, then the user isn't granted the cloudsqlsuperuser role.
If you create a user that uses built-in authentication for a MySQL 5.7 instance,
then the user is granted all privileges except for FILE and SUPER
automatically. If you need to change the privileges for the user, then use the
GRANT or
REVOKE command in the
mysql client.
For more information about these user accounts and privileges,
see
Other MySQL user accounts .
gcloud
Caution: When you use the gcloud sql users create
command to create a user, Cloud SQL doesn't check to see if the user exists.
If a user with the same name exists, then the command overwrites the user.
To create a user, use the
gcloud sql users create command.
Replace the following:
USER_NAME : the username.
HOST : the user's host name as a specific IP address, address
range, or any host ( % ).
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance.
PASSWORD : The password for the user.
ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 ..., ROLE_ N :
optional. The database role or roles to assign to the user.
gcloud sql users create USER_NAME \
--host = HOST \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--password = PASSWORD \
--database-roles = ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 , ..., ROLE_ N
If you create a user that uses built-in authentication for a MySQL 8.0 or later instance and don't
specify any database roles, then the user is granted the cloudsqlsuperuser role automatically.
For more information about the privileges associated with the cloudsqlsuperuser role,
see MySQL 8.0 user privileges (cloudsqlsuperuser) and
MySQL 8.4 user privileges (cloudsqlsuperuser) .
If you want to change the privileges for the user, then assign one or more custom MySQL roles
when you create the user in Cloud SQL. If you assign one or more custom database roles
when you create the user in Cloud SQL, then the user isn't granted the cloudsqlsuperuser role.
If you create a user that uses built-in authentication for a MySQL 5.7 instance,
then the user is granted all privileges except for FILE and SUPER
automatically. If you need to change the privileges for the user, then use the
GRANT or
REVOKE command in the
mysql client.
For more information about these user accounts and privileges,
see
Other MySQL user accounts .
Username length limits are the same for Cloud SQL as for
on-premises MySQL; 32 characters for MySQL 8.0 and later,
16 characters for earlier versions.
When you create a user, you can add user password policy parameters.
Terraform
To create a user, use a Terraform resource .
resource "random_password" "pwd" {
length = 16
special = false
}
resource "google_sql_user" "user" {
name = "user"
instance = google_sql_database_instance.default.name
password = random_password.pwd.result
}
You can also create a user and assign database roles.
resource "google_sql_user" "builtin_user" {
name = "test-user1"
password = "password"
instance = google_sql_database_instance.default.name
# Specify the list of database roles to be granted to the user
# The database roles must exist in the database.
database_roles = ["cloudsqlsuperuser"]
}
Apply the changes
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module ).
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension—for example main.tf . In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete!" message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Delete the changes
To delete your changes, do the following:
To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the
deletion_protection argument to false .
deletion_protection = "false"
Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and
entering yes at the prompt:
terraform apply
Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following
command and entering yes at the prompt:
terraform destroy

mysql Client
To create a user, at the mysql prompt, use the following
CREATE USER statement:
CREATE USER ' USER_NAME ' @ '%'
IDENTIFIED BY ' PASSWORD ' ;
Optionally, add the user password policy parameters.
You can confirm the user creation by displaying the user table:
SELECT user , host FROM mysql . user ;
For a Second Generation instance,
the output looks similar to this example:
+----------+-----------+
| user | host |
+----------+-----------+
| root | % |
| newuser | % |
+----------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
Give the user privileges with the
GRANT
statement.
For more information, see
Privileges Provided by MySQL .
Flush the mysql.user table to ensure that the change persists:
FLUSH TABLES mysql . user ;
Set a user password policy
You can set a password policy with the
built-in authentication type.
Note: Password policies don't apply to encrypted passwords.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.

a user can try the password incorrectly before the account is locked.
Supported only on Cloud SQL for MySQL 8.0 and later.
Require current password when password is changed : Requires
users to enter their existing password when attempting to change it.
User password policy options are supported on Cloud SQL for
MySQL 8.0 and later. The Set password to expire option is also supported on
Cloud SQL for MySQL 5.7.
gcloud
To set the user password policy, use the
gcloud sql users set-password-policy command.
Use the --password-policy-enable-password-verification to make it
mandatory for users to enter their existing password when attempting to change
the password. To disable this parameter, use --no-password-policy-enable-password-verification .
Replace the following:
USER_NAME : The user name.
INSTANCE_NAME : The name of the instance.
HOST : The user's host name as a specific IP address, address
range, or any host ( % ).
PASSWORD_POLICY_ALLOWED_FAILED_ATTEMPTS : Optional: The number of
times that a user can try the password incorrectly before the account is

mysql Client
To list MySQL users, at the mysql prompt, use the following
SELECT statement:
SELECT user , host FROM mysql . user ;
For a Second Generation instance with only the root user account configured,
the output looks similar to this example:
+------+-----------+
| user | host |
+------+-----------+
| root | % |
+------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
This example shows the users for an instance with
the root user. This user can connect from any host ( % ). The password field shows the hash of the password.
Note: You can't use the Google Cloud console or
gcloud to display system users.
Add database roles to an existing user
After you create a built-in user, you can assign additional roles to the user.
These roles are added to their existing roles and don't replace the existing
set of roles assigned to user account.
Before you can assign a role to a user in Cloud SQL for MySQL, the role
must already exist. To assign a custom role,
create the role in the MySQL database first.
To create a role in MySQL, see Using roles .
You can't assign roles to any of the MySQL system users
on the instance.
You can assign the cloudsqlsuperuser
system role to existing MySQL users on the instance.
gcloud
To assign roles to a user, use the
gcloud sql users assign-roles command.
gcloud sql users assign-roles USER_NAME \
--host = HOST \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--type = BUILT_IN \
--database-roles = ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 , ..., ROLE_ N
Replace the following:
USER_NAME : the username.
HOST : the user's host name as a specific IP address, address
range, or any host ( % ).
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance.
ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 , ..., ROLE_ N :
the database role or roles to assign to the user.

Replace database roles for an existing user
If you want to replace or remove database roles from the user,
you must revoke all of their existing roles while specifying new
database roles, if any.
By default, when you create a built-in MySQL user, the user is
granted the cloudsqlsuperuser role automatically. If you don't want a user
to keep the cloudsqlsuperuser role, then revoke the existing roles of the user.
gcloud
To replace the database roles for a user, you revoke the existing roles
for the user and assign new roles. To replace database roles for a user,
use the following
gcloud sql users assign-roles command.
gcloud sql users assign-roles USER_NAME \
--host = HOST \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--database-roles = ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 \
--revoke-existing-roles
Replace the following:
USER_NAME : the username.
HOST : the user's host name as a specific IP address, address
range, or any host ( % ).
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance.
ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 :
the new database role or roles to assign to the user.
You can also revoke the existing roles for a user and assign zero roles.
For example:
gcloud sql users assign-roles USER_NAME \
--host = HOST \
--instance = INSTANCE_NAME \
--database-roles = \
--revoke-existing-roles
REST v1
To update a user, use a PUT request with the

REST v1beta4
To update a user, use a PUT request with the
users:update method.
When you replace a user's database roles, you can't update password policy
parameters in the same API request.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
INSTANCE_ID : the desired instance ID
USER_ID : the ID of the user
ROLE_1 , ROLE_2 , ..., ROLE_ N :
the new database role or roles to assign to the user. You can also specify an empty list.
HTTP method and URL:
PUT https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_ID /users

Remove a user
The default user can remove users.
The methods described in this section do not allow
you to remove an anonymous user from your Cloud SQL instance. MySQL
includes an anonymous user that allows anyone to connect to the MySQL server
without a user account. If you want to remove an anonymous user, connect
to your Cloud SQL instance and remove the user manually. For more
information about removing anonymous users, refer to the
MySQL official documentation .
Before removing a user, you must drop all the objects it owns or reassign their
ownership, and revoke any privileges the role has been granted on other objects.
