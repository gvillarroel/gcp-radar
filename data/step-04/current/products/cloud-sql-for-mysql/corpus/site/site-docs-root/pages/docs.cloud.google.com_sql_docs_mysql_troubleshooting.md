Troubleshooting
You can't see the current operation's status.
The Google Cloud console reports only success or failure when the operation
is done. It isn't designed to show warnings or other updates.
Run the
gcloud sql operations list command to list all
operations for the given Cloud SQL instance.
You want to find out who issued an on-demand backup operation.
The user interface doesn't show the user who started an operation.
Look in the logs
and filter by text to find the user. You may need to use audit logs for
private information. Relevant log files include:
cloudsql.googlapis.com/mysql-general.log
cloudsql.googleapis.com/mysql.err
If Cloud Audit Logs is enabled and
you have the required permissions to view them,
cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity may also be available.
After an instance is deleted, you can't take a backup of the instance.
If you delete an instance without taking a final backup of the data, then no data recovery is possible. However, if you restore the instance, then Cloud SQL also restores the backups. For more
information on recovering a deleted instance, see
Retain backups after instance deletion .
If you have done an export operation, create a new instance
and then do an import operation to recreate the database. Exports are
written to Cloud Storage and imports are read from there.
Note: Cloud SQL recommends that you take a final backup of your data before you delete the instance. This way, you can recreate any instances that you delete accidentally without contacting Cloud Customer Care .
An automated backup is stuck for many hours and can't be canceled.
Backups can take a long time depending on the database size.
If you really need to cancel the operation, you can ask
customer support to force restart the instance.
A restore operation can fail when one or more users referenced in the
SQL dump file don't exist.
Before restoring a SQL dump, all the database users who own objects or
were granted permissions on objects in the dumped database must exist in the
target database. If they don't, the restore operation fails to recreate the
objects with the original ownership or permissions.
Create the database users before restoring the SQL dump.
You want to increase the number of days that you can keep automatic
backups from seven to 30 days, or longer.
You can
configure the number of automated backups to retain ,
from 1 to 365. Automated backups get pruned
regularly based on the retention value configured. Unfortunately, this means that the
currently visible backups are the only automated backups you can restore from.
To keep backups indefinitely, you can
create
an on-demand backup , as they are not deleted in the same way as
automated backups. On-demand backups remain indefinitely. That is, they
remain until they're deleted or the instance they belong to is deleted.
Because that type of backup is not deleted automatically, it can affect
billing.
An automated backup failed and you didn't receive an email notification.
To have Cloud SQL notify you of the backup's status, configure a log-based alert .
Unable to delete an instance when you elect to
take a final backup at instance deletion.
When you delete an instance, you're required to confirm whether you want to
take a final backup for your instance prior to deleting it. If you enabled
final backup using the final-backup instance setting, then the selection
you make when you delete your instance must match the final backup
instance configuration you set when you enabled final backup for your
instance. To mitigate this issue, do one of the following:
Set the final backup value to match the instance's existing backup
configuration.
Leave the final backup field empty when you delete your instance. If
you leave the field empty, then Cloud SQL takes the final backup
configuration set in instance settings to take a final backup and define
its retention.
To view your instance's final backup instance configuration, see
View instance information .
Unable to create a replica instance after successfully creating a
primary instance with the final backup setting.
If you create a new instance with the final backup instance setting
enabled, then you must update the final backup organization policy
to apply the backup configurations to the primary instance only.
Final backups aren't supported for replica instances.
For more information, see
Cloud SQL organization policies .
Cancel import and export
Issue
Troubleshooting
Error message: You can't cancel operation [operation-ID] because
this operation isn't in progress.
You're trying to cancel an import or export operation that's completed,
failed, or cancelled. If the operation is running, you can cancel it.
Error message: You can't cancel operation [operation-ID] because
Cloud SQL doesn't support the cancellation of an [operation-type]
operation.
Cloud SQL
doesn't support the cancellation of the operation because it has an operation type other than IMPORT
or EXPORT .
Error message: The [operation-type] operation isn't cancelled. Wait
and retry in a few seconds.
Cloud SQL can't cancel the import or export operation at this time.
Try again in a few seconds. If the problem persists, contact
Google Cloud Support .
Clone
Issue
Troubleshooting
Cloning fails with constraints/sql.restrictAuthorizedNetworks error.
The cloning operation is blocked by the Authorized Networks configuration.
Authorized Networks are configured for public IP addresses in the Connectivity section
of the Google Cloud console, and cloning is not permitted due to
security considerations .
Remove all Authorized Networks entries from the Cloud SQL
instance if you can. Otherwise,
create a replica
without any Authorized Networks entries.
Error message: Failed to create subnetwork. Couldn't find free
blocks in allocated IP ranges. Please allocate new ranges for this service
provider. Help Token: [help-token-id].
You're trying to use the Google Cloud console to clone an instance with a private IP
address, but you didn't specify the allocated IP range that you want
to use and the source instance isn't created with the specified range. As
a result, the cloned instance is created in a random range.
Use gcloud to clone the instance and provide a value for
the --allocated-ip-range-name parameter. For more information,
see Cloning an instance with a private IP .
Connect
Issue
Troubleshooting
Aborted connection .
The issue might be:
Networking instability.
No response to TCP keep-alive commands (either the client or the
server isn't responsive, possibly overloaded)
The database engine connection lifetime was exceeded and the server
ends the connection.
Applications must tolerate network failures and follow
best practices
such as connection pooling and retrying. Most connection poolers catch
these errors where possible. Otherwise the application must either retry or
fail gracefully.
For connection retry, we recommend the following methods:
Exponential
backoff . Increase the time interval between each retry, exponentially.
Add randomized backoff also.
Combining these methods helps reduce throttling.
Error message: Login failed for user ""
You might encounter this login error during
Microsoft Entra ID authentication .
To resolve this issue, make sure that a SQL Server login exists for this
Microsoft Entra ID user.
Network connectivity issues with private IP instances
You might experience some of the following issues during integration
setup:
Slow operations to create Microsoft Entra ID logins
Unable to create Microsoft Entra ID logins
Unable to connect to the instance using Microsoft Entra ID authentication
For more information on how to help address these issues, see
Troubleshooting Microsoft Entra ID integration .
Certificate verify failed .
The client certificates have expired or the path to the certificates isn't correct.
Regenerate the certificates by recreating them .
Create instances
Issue
Troubleshooting
Error message: The zone or region does not have sufficient
resources to handle the request at the moment.
The selected zone lacks capacity for the requested resources or
the VM type at the time of the instance creation request.
There might be simultaneous high operational demand in that specific
regional location at the time of request.
To resolve this issue, retry creating the instance
in another zone or retry creating the instance in the same zone that received
the error at a different time of day.
Error message: Failed to create subnetwork. Couldn't
find free blocks in allocated IP ranges. Please allocate new ranges for
this service provider .
There are no more available addresses in the allocated IP range. There
can be several possible scenarios:
The size of the allocated IP range for the private service connection
is smaller than /24.
The size of the allocated IP range for the private service connection
is too small for the number of Cloud SQL instances.
The requirement on the size of allocated IP range will be larger if
instances are created in multiple regions.
See allocated range size
To resolve this issue, you can either expand the
existing allocated IP range or allocate an additional IP range to the
private service connection. For more information, see
Allocate an IP address range .
If you used the --allocated-ip-range-name flag while creating
the Cloud SQL instance, you may only expand the specified IP range.
If you're allocating a new range, take care that the allocation doesn't
overlap with any existing allocations.
After creating a new IP range, update the vpc peering with the following
command:
gcloud services vpc-peerings update \
--service = servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--ranges = OLD_RESERVED_RANGE_NAME , NEW_RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \
--network = VPC_NETWORK \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--force
If you're expanding an existing allocation, take care to increase only the
allocation range and not decrease it. For example, if the original allocation
was 10.0.10.0/24, then make the new allocation at least 10.0.10.0/23.
In general, if starting from a /24 allocation, decrementing the /mask by
1 for each condition (additional instance type group, additional region) is
a good rule of thumb. For example, if trying to create both instance type
groups on the same allocation, going from /24 to /23 is enough.
After expanding an existing IP range, update the vpc peering with
following command:
gcloud services vpc-peerings update \
--service = servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--ranges = RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \
--network = VPC_NETWORK \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Error message: Failed to create subnetwork. Router status is
temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. Help Token:
[token-ID] .
Try to create the Cloud SQL instance again.
Error message: HTTPError 400: Invalid request: Incorrect Service Networking config for instance: PROJECT_ID : INSTANCE_NAME :SERVICE_NETWORKING_NOT_ENABLED.
Enable the Service Networking API using the following command and try to create the Cloud SQL instance again.
gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Error message: Failed to create subnetwork. Required
'compute.projects.get' permission for PROJECT_ID .
When you create an instance using with a Private IP address, a service
account is created just-in-time using the Service Networking API. If
you have only recently enabled the Service Networking API, then the
service account might not get created and the instance creation fails. In
this case, you must wait for the service account to propagate throughout
the system or manually add it with the required permissions.
Error message: More than 3 subject alternative names are not
allowed.
You're trying to use a custom SAN to add more than three DNS names to
the server certificate of a Cloud SQL instance. You can't add more
than three DNS names to the instance.
Error message: Subject alternative names %s is too long. The
maximum length is 253 characters.
Make sure that any DNS names that you want to add to the server
certificate of a Cloud SQL instance don't have more than 253
characters.
Error message: Subject alternative name %s is invalid.
Verify that the DNS names that you want to add to the server
certificate of a Cloud SQL instance meet the following criteria:
They don't have wildcard characters.
They don't have trailing dots.
They meet RFC
1034 specifications.
Export
Issue
Troubleshooting
HTTP Error 409: Operation failed because another operation was
already in progress.
There is already a pending operation for your instance. Only one operation
is allowed at a time. Try your request after the current operation is
complete.
HTTP Error 403: The service account does not have the required
permissions for the bucket.
Ensure that the bucket exists and the service account for the Cloud SQL
instance (which is performing the export) has the
Storage Object Creator role
( roles/storage.objectCreator ) to allow export to the bucket. See
IAM roles for Cloud Storage .
CSV export worked but SQL export failed.
CSV and SQL formats do export differently. The SQL format exports the
entire database, and likely takes longer to complete. The CSV format lets
you define which elements of the database to include in the export.
Use CSV exports
to export only what you need.
Export is taking too long.
Cloud SQL does not support concurrent synchronous operations.
Use
export offloading . At a high level, in export offloading, instead of
issuing an export on the source instance, Cloud SQL spins up an
offload instance to perform the export. Export offloading has several
advantages, including increased performance on the source instance and the
unblocking of administrative operations while the export is running. With
export offloading, total latency can increase by the amount of time it takes
to bring up the offload instance. Generally, for reasonably sized exports,
latency is not significant. However, if your export is small enough, then
you may notice the increase in latency.
You want exports to be automated.
Cloud SQL does not provide a way to automate exports.
You could build your own automated export system using Google Cloud
products such as Cloud Scheduler, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Run functions,
similar to this article on
automating backups .
External primary
Issue
Troubleshooting
Lost connection to MySQL server during query when dumping table .
The source may have become unavailable, or the dump contained packets
too large.
Make sure the external primary is available to connect.
You can also modify the values of the
net_read_timeout
and net_write_timeout
flags on the source instance to stop the error.
For more information on the allowable values for these flags, see
Configure database flags .
To learn more about using mysqldump flags for managed
import migration, see
Allowed and default initial sync flags
The initial data migration was successful, but no data is being
replicated.
One possible root cause could be your source database has defined
replication flags which result in some or all database changes not being
replicated over.
Make sure the replication flags such as binlog-do-db ,
binlog-ignore-db , replicate-do-db or
replicate-ignore-db are not set in a conflicting way.
Run the command show master status on the primary instance to
see the current settings.
The initial data migration was successful but data replication stops
working after a while.
Things to try:
Check the
replication metrics for your replica instance in the Cloud Monitoring
section of the Google Cloud console.
The errors from the MySQL IO thread or SQL thread can be
found in Cloud Logging in the
mysql.err log files.
The error can also be found when connecting to the replica instance.
Run the command SHOW SLAVE STATUS , and check for the
following fields in the output:
Slave_IO_Running
Slave_SQL_Running
Last_IO_Error
Last_SQL_Error
mysqld check failed: data disk is full .
The data disk of the replica instance is full.
Increase the disk size of the replica instance. You
can either manually increase the disk size or enable auto storage increase.
External replica
Issue
Troubleshooting
Error message: The slave is connecting ... master has purged
binary logs containing GTIDs that the slave requires .
The primary Cloud SQL instance has automatic backups and binary
logs and point-in-time recovery is enabled, so it should have enough logs
for the replica to be able to catch up. However, in this case although the
binary logs exist, the replica doesn't know which row to start reading from.
Create a new dump file using the correct flag settings, and configure the
external replica using that file
Connect to your mysql client
through a
Compute Engine instance .
Run
mysqldump and use the --master-data=1 and
--flush-privileges flags.
Important: Do not include the --set-gtid-purged=OFF
flag .
Learn
more .
Ensure that the dump file just created contains the
SET @@GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED='...' line.
Upload the dump file to a Cloud Storage bucket and
configure the replica using the dump file .
Flags
Issue
Troubleshooting
After enabling a flag the instance loops between panicking and crashing.
Contact customer support to
request flag removal followed by a hard drain . This forces the
instance to restart on a different host with a fresh configuration without
the undesired flag or setting.
You see the error message Bad syntax for dict arg when
trying to set a flag.
Complex parameter values , such as comma-separated lists, require special
treatment when used with gcloud commands.
High availability
Issue
Troubleshooting
You can't find the metrics for a manual failover.
Only automatic failovers go into the metrics .
Cloud SQL instance resources (CPU and RAM) are near 100% usage,
causing the high availability instance to go down.
The instance machine size is too small for the load.
Edit the instance to upgrade to a larger machine size to get more CPUs
and memory.
Import
Issue
Troubleshooting
HTTP Error 409: Operation failed because another operation was already in progress .
There is already a pending operation for your instance. Only one operation
is allowed at a time. Try your request after the current operation is
complete.
The import operation is taking too long.
Too many active connections can interfere with import operations.
Close unused operations. Check the CPU and memory usage of your
Cloud SQL instance to make sure there
are plenty of resources available. The best way to ensure maximum resources
for the import is to restart the instance before beginning the operation.
A restart:
Closes all connections.
Ends any tasks that may be consuming resources.
An import operation can fail when one or more users referenced in the
dump file don't exist.
Before importing a dump file, all the database users who own objects or
were granted permissions on objects in the dumped database must exist in the
target database. If they don't, the import operation fails to recreate the
objects with the original ownership or permissions.
Create the database users before importing.
An import operation fails with an error that a table doesn't exist.
Tables can have foreign key dependencies on other tables, and depending on
the order of operations, one or more of those tables might not yet exist
during the import operation.
Things to try:
Add the following line at the start of the dump file:
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0 ;
Additionally, add this line at the end of the dump file:
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1 ;
These settings deactivate data integrity checks while the import
operation is in progress, and reactivate them after the data is loaded. This
doesn't affect the integrity of the data on the database, because the data was
already validated during the creation of the dump file.
Integrate with Vertex AI
Issue
Troubleshooting
Error message: Google ML integration API is supported only on MySQL version 8.0.36 or above.
To enable the Vertex AI integration in Cloud SQL, you must have a Cloud SQL for MySQL database, version 8.0.36 or later. To upgrade your database to this version, see Upgrade the database minor version .
Error message: Google ML Integration API is not supported on shared core instance. Please upsize your machine type.
If you selected a shared core for the machine type of your instance, then you can't enable the Vertex AI integration in Cloud SQL. Upgrade your machine type to dedicated core. For more information, see Machine Type .
Error message: Google ML Integration is unsupported for this maintenance version. Please follow https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/self-service-maintenance to update the maintenance version of the instance.

Logging
Issue
Troubleshooting
Audit logs are not found.
Data-Access logs are only written if the operation is an authenticated
user-driven API call that creates, modifies, or reads user-created data,
or if the operation accesses configuration files or metadata of resources.
Operations information is not found in logs.
You want to find more information about an operation.
For example, a user was deleted but you can't find out who did it.
The logs show the
operation started but don't provide any more information. You must
enable
audit logging for detailed and personal identifying
information (PII) like this to be logged.
Logging is using a lot of disk space.
There are three kinds of log files that use disk space: redo logs,
general logs and binary logs.
Connect to the database and run these commands for details on each type:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_log_file%' ;
SELECT ROUND ( SUM ( LENGTH ( argument ) / POW ( 1024 , 2 ), 2 )
AS GB from mysql . general_log ;
SHOW BINARY LOGS ;
Log files are hard to read.
You'd rather view the logs as json or text.You can use the
gcloud logging read
command along with linux post-processing commands to download the logs.
To download the logs as JSON:
gcloud logging read \
"resource.type=cloudsql_database \
AND logName=projects/ PROJECT_ID \
/logs/cloudsql.googleapis.com%2F LOG_NAME " \
--format json \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--freshness = "1d" \
> downloaded-log.json
To download the logs as TEXT:
gcloud logging read \
"resource.type=cloudsql_database \
AND logName=projects/ PROJECT_ID \
/logs/cloudsql.googleapis.com%2F LOG_NAME " \
--format json \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--freshness = "1d" | jq -rnc --stream 'fromstream(1|truncate_stream(inputs)) \
| .textPayload' \
--order = asc
> downloaded-log.txt
Manage instances
Issue
Troubleshooting
Slow performance after restarting MySQL.
Cloud SQL allows caching of data in the InnoDB buffer pool.
However, after a restart, this cache is always empty, and all reads require
a round trip to the backend to get data. As a result, queries can be slower
than expected until the cache is filled.
Slow crash recovery.
A large general_log may have accumulated.
You can reduce crash recovery time by preventing a large
general_log from accumulating. If you have general_log
on, truncate the table and only enable general_log for short
periods of time.
You can find out the size of the general logs by connecting to the
database and running this query:
SELECT ROUND(SUM(LENGTH(argument)/POW(1024,2)),2) from mysql.general_log;
You want to find out what is using up storage.
For example, you notice that your database is using only three GB, but
storage says that 14 GB is being used. Most of the space not used by tables
is used by binary logs and/or temporary files.
Things to try:
You can check the storage occupied by binary logs using the following
command in the MySQL command line interface:
SHOW BINARY LOGS;
Temporary tables may also be occupying a significant amount of
storage space. To check the temporary space usage, use the
following command:
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME='innodb_temporary'\G .
The following command lets you check the redo log size:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_log_file%';
You can check the size of general_log , if it is
enabled, with the help of this command:
SELECT ROUND(SUM(LENGTH(argument)/POW(1024,2)),2) AS GB from mysql.general_log;
If needed, you can truncate your log tables by using the API. For more
information, see the
instances.truncateLog reference page .
Learn more
about setting
and
configuring slow-query logs.
Queries are blocked.
It's possible for queries to lock the MySQL database causing all
subsequent queries to block/timeout.
Connect to the database and execute this query:
SHOW PROCESSLIST .
The first item in the list may be the one holding the lock, which the
subsequent items are waiting on.
The SHOW INNODB STATUS query can also be helpful.
You are unable to manually delete binary logs.
Binary logs cannot be manually deleted. Binary logs are automatically
deleted with their associated automatic backup, which generally happens
after about seven days.
You want to find information about temporary files.
A file named ibtmp1 is used for storing temporary
data. This file is reset upon database restart. To find information about
temporary file usage, connect to the database and
execute the following query:
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME='innodb_temporary'\G
You want to find out about table sizes.
This information is available in the database.
Connect to the database and execute the following query:
SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME, sum(DATA_LENGTH+INDEX_LENGTH)/pow(1024,2)
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA NOT IN ('PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA','INFORMATION_SCHEMA','SYS','MYSQL')
GROUP BY TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME;
mysqld got a signal 11.
Try refactoring queries so that they don't create too many connections.
If that doesn't resolve the issue, contact customer support .
Signal 11 usually represents a MySQL software issue.
InnoDB: page_cleaner: 1000ms intended loop took 5215ms. The
settings might not be optimal.
The page cleaner can't keep up with the rate of change on the instance.
Once per second, the page cleaner scans the buffer pool for dirty pages to
flush from the buffer pool to disk. The warning you see shows it has lots
of dirty pages to flush, and it's taking more than one second to flush a
batch of them to disk.
Shard the instance
if possible. Using many smaller Cloud SQL instances is better than one
large instance.
Temporary storage increased automatic storage.
Automatic storage is enabled.
Restart deletes the temporary files but not
reduce the storage. Only
customer support can reset the instance size.
Data is being automatically deleted.
Most likely a script is running somewhere in your environment.
Look in the logs around the time of the deletion and see if there's a
rogue script running from a dashboard or another automated process.
The instance cannot be deleted.
You might see the error message ERROR: (gcloud.sql.instances.delete) HTTP Error
409: The instance or operation is not in an appropriate state to handle the
request , or the instance may have a INSTANCE_RISKY_FLAG_CONFIG
flag status.
Some possible explanations include:
Another operation is in progress. Cloud SQL operations do not
run concurrently. Wait for the other operation to complete.
The INSTANCE_RISKY_FLAG_CONFIG warning is triggered
whenever at least one beta flag is being used. Remove the
risky flag settings and restart the instance
The instance is stuck due to large temporary data size.
The system can create many temporary tables at one time, depending on
the queries and the load.
Unfortunately, you can't shrink the ibtmp1 file by any method
other than restarting the service.
One mitigation option is to create the temporary table with
ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED , so it is stored
in file-per-table tablespaces in the temporary file directory. However, the
downside is performance costs associated with creating and removing a
file-per-table tablespace for each temporary table.
Fatal error during upgrade.
Logs may reveal more, but in any case
customer support may be needed to
force re-create the instance.
Instance is stuck on restart after running out of disk space.
Automatic storage increase capability isn't enabled.
If your instance runs out of storage, and the automatic storage increase
capability isn't enabled, your instance goes offline. To avoid this issue,
you can
edit the instance to enable automatic storage increase.
Your on-premises primary instance is stuck.
Google Cloud can't help with instances that are not in Cloud SQL.
Slow shutdown on restart.
When an instance shuts down, any outstanding connections that don't
end within 60 seconds make the shutdown unclean.
By having connections that last less than 60 seconds, most unclean
shutdowns can be avoided, including connections from the database
command prompt. If you keep these connections open for hours or days,
shutdowns can be unclean.
A user cannot be deleted.
The user probably has objects in the database that depend on it. You
need to drop those objects or reassign them to another user.
Find out which objects are dependent on the user, then drop or reassign
those objects to a different user.
This article discusses how to find the objects owned by the user.
Particular queries are running slow.
Queries can be slow for many reasons, mostly due to specific database
aspects. One reason that can involve Cloud SQL is network latency,
when the source (writer or reader) resource and the destination
(Cloud SQL) resource are in different regions.
Refer to
general performance tips in particular.
For slow database inserts, updates, or deletes, consider the following
actions:
If you enable the long_query_time flag, you can check the
logs for slow queries. Go to the
Logs Explorer page for your project
and run a query like this:
resource.type = "cloudsql_database"
resource.labels.database_id = " INSTANCE-ID "
log_name = "projects/ PROJECT-ID /logs/cloudsql.googleapis.com%2Fmysql-slow.log"
You can
download the logs in JSON or TEXT format for local processing.
Check the locations of the writer and database; sending data a long
distance introduces latency.
Check the location of the reader and database; latency affects read
performance even more than write performance
To reduce the latency the recommendation is to locate both the source and
destination resources in the same region.
Out of memory is indicated but monitoring charts don't show that.
An instance can fail and report Out of memory but the
Google Cloud console or Cloud Monitoring charts seem to show there's still
memory remaining.
There are other factors beside your workload that can impact memory
usage, such as the number of active connections and internal overhead
processes. These aren't always reflected in the monitoring charts.
Ensure that the instance has enough overhead to account for your workload
plus some additional overhead.
Recovering a deleted instance.
All data on an instance, including backups, is permanently lost when
that instance is deleted.
To preserve your data,
export it to Cloud Storage before you
delete an instance .
The Cloud SQL Admin role includes the permission to delete the
instance. To prevent accidental deletion, grant this role only as needed.
You want to rename an existing Cloud SQL instance.
Renaming an existing instance is not supported.
There are other ways to accomplish the goal by creating a new instance.
You can clone the instance
you want to rename and set a new name for the
cloned instance. This allows you to create the new instance without
having to import data manually. Just as when creating a new instance,
the cloned instance has a new IP address.
You can export
data from your instance into a Cloud Storage
bucket, create a new instance with the new name you want, and then
import the data
into the new instance.
In both cases, you can delete your old instance after the operation is
done. We recommend going with the cloning route since it has no impact on
performance and doesn't require you to redo any instance configuration
settings such as flags, machine type, storage size and memory.
Error when deleting an instance.
If deletion protection is enabled for an instance, confirm your plans
to delete the instance. Then
disable deletion protection before deleting the instance.
Private Service Connect
Issue
Troubleshooting
The service attachment of the instance doesn't accept the Private Service Connect endpoint.
Check the endpoint's status.
gcloud
To check the status, use the gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe command.
gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe ENDPOINT_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--region = REGION_NAME \
| grep pscConnectionStatus
Make the following replacements:
ENDPOINT_NAME : the name of the endpoint
PROJECT_ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the endpoint
REGION_NAME : the region name for the endpoint
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the Private Service Connect endpoint
REGION_NAME : the name of the region
ENDPOINT_NAME : the name of the endpoint
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT_NAME
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT_NAME "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT_NAME " | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"kind": "compute#forwardingRule",
"id": " ENDPOINT_ID ",
"creationTimestamp": "2024-05-09T12:03:21.383-07:00",
"name": " ENDPOINT_NAME ",
"region": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME ",
"IPAddress": " IP_ADDRESS ",
"target": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME /serviceAttachments/ SERVICE_ATTACHMENT_NAME ",
"selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION_NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT_NAME ",
"network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/default",
"serviceDirectoryRegistrations": [
{
"namespace": "goog-psc-default"
}
],
"networkTier": "PREMIUM",
"labelFingerprint": " LABEL_FINGERPRINT_ID ",
"fingerprint": " FINGERPRINT_ID ",
"pscConnectionId": " CONNECTION_ID ",
"pscConnectionStatus": "ACCEPTED",
"allowPscGlobalAccess": true
}
Verify that the status of the endpoint is ACCEPTED . If the status is PENDING , then the instance isn't allowing the Google Cloud project that contains the endpoint. Make sure that the network project in which the endpoint is created is allowed. For more information, see Edit an instance with Private Service Connect enabled .
ERROR: (gcloud.compute.forwarding-rules.create) Could not fetch resource: The resource 'projects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET_NAME' was not found
This error message can occur when reserving a static internal IP address for the Private Service Connect endpoint.
Make sure the subnet specified exists in the project specified by the URI. If you want to create an endpoint in a service project but use a subnet from a Shared VPC network,
you need to specify the subnet by its URI and use the host project's project ID in the URI.
For more information, see Create the endpoint manually .
ERROR: (gcloud.compute.forwarding-rules.create) Could not fetch resource:
- The resource 'projects/PROJECT_ID/global/networks/NETWORK_NAME' was not found
This error message can occur when you create a Private Service Connect endpoint manually.
Make sure the network specified exists in the project specified by the URI. If you want to create an endpoint in a service project but use a Shared VPC network,
you need to specify the network by its URI and use the host project's project ID in the URI.
For more information, see Create the endpoint manually .
Invalid consumer network status for PSC auto connection .
The consumer network is either not configured correctly, or not
configured at all, and therefore, no endpoint is available to connect to. To
connect to the endpoint, you'll need to check the status of the endpoint,
and fix the error before trying to connect again.
To check the status of an endpoint,
see Retrive the endpoint .
The status of the endpoint can be one of the following:
CONNECTION_POLICY_MISSING : there is no matching service
connection policy on the consumer network. Service connection policies
are configured by network, by region. To reconfigure the network,
see Update a service connection policy .
CONSUMER_INSTANCE_PROJECT_NOT_ALLOWLISTED : there is a
matching service connection policy, but the
Service
instance scope field in the policy is not configured to allow
connection to this Cloud SQL instance. Update the policy to
configure the value of the Service instance scope field
( --producer-instance-location ) with the project, folder, or
organization where the Cloud SQL instance resides. To reconfigure
the service connection policy, see
Update a service connection policy .
POLICY_LIMIT_REACHED : the service connection policy
has reached its endpoint limit. To resolve, you'll need to increase the
endpoint limit by
updating the service connection policy .
No permission to create a service connection policy .
You don't have the required permissions to create a service
connection policy. To create a service connection policy, you need the
Compute Network Admin IAM role. For more information,
see Roles and permissions .
The network attachment is unable to accept connections from the
Private Service Connect interface when
using
Private Service Connect outbound connectivity .
If your external network is unable to accept connections from
the Private Service Connect interface,
then the connection policies on your network attachment may not be
configured correctly.
Network attachments need to be configured to either
accept all connections automatically, or configured manually
with a list of accepted connections.
For more information, see Connection policies .
Use the following command to verify the accepted connections
in your network attachment:
gcloud compute network-attachments describe default
--region = REGION_ID
If the Private Service Connect interface isn't on the accepted
list, then update your network attachment . For more information, see
Manage network attachments .
Replication
Issue
Troubleshooting
Read replica didn't start replicating on creation.
There's probably a more specific error in the log files.
Inspect the logs in
Cloud Logging to find the actual error.
Unable to create read replica - invalidFlagValue error.
One of the flags in the request is invalid. It could be a flag you
provided explicitly or one that was set to a default value.
First, check that the value of the max_connections flag is
greater than or equal to the value on the primary.
If the max_connections flag is set appropriately,
inspect the logs in
Cloud Logging to find the actual error.
Unable to create read replica - unknown error.
There's probably a more specific error in the log files.
Inspect the logs in
Cloud Logging to find the actual error.
If the error is: set Service Networking service account as
servicenetworking.serviceAgent role on consumer project , then disable
and re-enable the Service
Networking API . This action creates the service account necessary
to continue with the process.
Disk is full.
The primary instance disk size can become full during replica creation.
Edit the primary instance to upgrade it to a larger disk size.
The replica instance is using too much memory.
The replica uses temporary memory to cache often-requested read
operations, which can lead it to use more memory than the primary instance.
Restart the replica instance to reclaim the temporary memory space.
Replication stopped.
The maximum storage limit was reached and automatic storage
increase isn't enabled.
Edit the instance to enable automatic storage increase .
Replication lag is consistently high.
The write load is too high for the replica to handle. Replication lag
takes place when the SQL thread on a replica is unable to keep up with the
IO thread. Some kinds of queries or workloads can cause temporary or
permanent high replication lag for a given schema. Some of the typical
causes of replication lag are:
Slow queries on the replica. Find and fix them.
All tables must have a unique/primary key. Every update on such a
table without a unique/primary key causes full table scans on th
replica.
Queries like DELETE ... WHERE field < 50000000 cause
replication lag with row-based replication since a huge number of
updates are piled up on the replica.
Some possible solutions include:
Configure parallel replication .
Set the
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit
flag on the read replica to 2.
See Tips
for working with flags for more information about this flag.
Edit the instance to increase the size of the replica.
Reduce the load on the database.
Send read traffic to the read replica.
Index the tables.
Identify and fix slow write queries.
Recreate the replica.
Replication lag suddenly spikes.
This is caused by long-running transaction(s). When a transaction
(single statement or multi-statements) commits on the source instance, the
start time of the transaction is recorded in the binary log. When the
replica receives this binlog event, it compares that timestamp with the current
timestamp to calculate replication lag. Hence, a long-running transaction
on the source would result in an immediate large replication lag on the
replica. If the amount of row changes in the transaction is large, the
replica would also spend a long time to execute it. During the time,
replication lag is increasing. Once the replica finishes this
transaction, the catch up period would depend on the write workload on the
source and the replica's processing speed.
To avoid a long transaction, some possible solutions include:
Break the transaction into multiple small transactions
Chunk a single large write query into smaller batches
Try to separate long SELECT queries from a transaction mixed with DMLs
Changing parallel replication flags results in an error.
An incorrect value is set for one of or more of these flags.
On the primary instance that's displaying the error message, set the
parallel replication flags:
Modify the binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking and
transaction_write_set_extraction flags:
binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking=COMMIT_ORDER
transaction_write_set_extraction=OFF
Add the slave_pending_jobs_size_max flag:
slave_pending_jobs_size_max=33554432
Modify the transaction_write_set_extraction flag:
transaction_write_set_extraction=XXHASH64
Modify the binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking flag:
binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking=WRITESET
Replica creation fails with timeout.
Long-running uncommitted transactions on the primary instance can cause
read replica creation to fail.
Recreate the replica after stopping all running queries.
