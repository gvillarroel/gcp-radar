This page explains cloning, and describes how to clone an instance.
Overview
Cloning a Cloud SQL instance creates a new instance that is
a copy of the source instance. The new instance is completely independent from
the source instance.
Note: If there are many changes done recently on your instance, then cloning the
instance might start a long-running operation.
Standard clone
Standard clone creates a full backup of the source instance. The instance then
uses that backup to provision a new, separate instance. The new instance is a
functionally independent copy of the source at the time the operation began. The
duration of a standard cloning operation is proportional to the database size.
Fast clone
Fast clone uses an Instant Snapshot to create a new instance, which is
a significant evolution from standard clone.
When you initiate a clone operation in the same zone as the source instance,
fast clone takes an Instant Snapshot. It then creates the new
disk using this Instant Snapshot. This process is a metadata-only
operation, so the size of the data does not affect the clone creation time.
When fast clone is used
Cloud SQL automatically uses fast clone when the following conditions are met:
Same-zone operations: the clone operation must be initiated within the same
zone as the source instance. Specifying a different zone (or even
re-specifying the same zone) will default the process to the standard clone
workflow.
Disk properties consistency: the new clone's disk properties must exactly
match the source instance (e.g., Persistent Disk versus Google Cloud Hyperdisk,
encryption type, block size).
Database engine support: the database engine is Cloud SQL for MySQL or
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
If your cloning operation requires restoring to a specific point-in-time
recovery (PITR) timestamp, the
system defaults to the standard clone workflow.

Frequently asked questions
Question
Answer
Does cloning impact performance?
No. Cloning has no performance impact on the source instance.
Are backups copied to the new instance?
No. The new instance creates new automated backups. Manual
backups are not copied over from the source instance.
Does the new instance have the same IP address or addresses?
No. The new instance has a new IP address or addresses.
Does the new instance have the same configuration settings?
Yes. The new instance has the same settings such as database
flags, connectivity options, machine type, and storage and memory
settings.
Are replicas copied to the new instance?
No. You need to create new replicas for the new instance.
Can you clone a replica?
No. You can't clone a replica.
Can you make a clone from an earlier point in time?
Yes.
Point-in-time recovery uses cloning to restore an instance
from an earlier point in time. This helps you recover your database from
a destructive event.
Are the maintenance settings
of the source instance automatically copied to the clone instance?
No. You need to configure the maintenance settings for the clone instance.
Can you clone an instance that was once a clone?
Yes. You can clone an instance that was cloned from another instance.
Are database users copied to the new instance?
Yes, but database user passwords are not copied, and need to be
recreated.
Clone an instance
You can clone a Cloud SQL instance by using the Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI , Terraform, or the API.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Find the row of the instance to clone.
In the Actions column, click the more_vert More Actions menu.
Click Create clone .
On the Create a clone page, update the instance ID if needed, and
click Create clone , leaving Clone current state of instance
selected.
You are returned to the instance listing page while the clone initializes.
gcloud
To clone an instance, use the gcloud sql instances clone command:
gcloud sql instances clone SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME DESTINATION_INSTANCE_NAME \
--project PROJECT_ID \
--preferred-zone ZONE_NAME \
--preferred-secondary-zone SECONDARY_ZONE_NAME
Make the following replacements:
SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the Cloud SQL instance to clone.
DESTINATION_INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the cloned instance.
PROJECT_ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the source and destination instances.
ZONE_NAME : Optional. The name of the primary zone for the destination instance. Use this if you want the destination instance to be in a different primary zone than the Cloud SQL instance that you're cloning. For a regional instance, this zone replaces the primary zone, but the secondary zone remains the same as the source instance.
SECONDARY_ZONE_NAME : Optional. The name of the secondary zone for the destination instance. Use this to specify a different secondary zone for the regional Cloud SQL instance that you want to clone.
If you're using the --preferred-zone and --preferred-secondary-zone parameters, then the following conditions apply:
Both the primary and secondary zones must be valid zones.
Both zones must belong to the same region as the source instance.
The primary and secondary zones must be different.
For zonal instances, you can't use the --preferred-secondary-zone parameter. If you do, then the process to clone the instance fails.
If you don't specify values for either the --preferred-zone or --preferred-secondary-zone parameters, then the cloned instance has the same primary and secondary zones as the source instance.
To run the gcloud sql instances clone
command, you must have the cloudsql.instances.clone permission. For more information about required permissions to run gcloud CLI commands, see Cloud SQL permissions .
Note: If you want to clone an instance that has Private Service Connect enabled for it, then you don't need to specify the enable-private-service-connect , allowed-psc-projects , and no-assign-ip flags. The cloned instance inherits these flags from the source instance.
Terraform
To clone the instance, use a Terraform resource
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "clone" {
name = "mysql-instance-clone-name"
region = "us-central1"
database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
clone {
source_instance_name = google_sql_database_instance.source.id
}
# set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by
# use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.
deletion_protection = false
}
Apply the changes
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module ).
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension—for example main.tf . In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete!" message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Delete the changes
To delete your changes, do the following:
To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the
deletion_protection argument to false .
deletion_protection = "false"
Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and
entering yes at the prompt:
terraform apply
Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following
command and entering yes at the prompt:
terraform destroy

If you don't specify an allocated IP range, the following behavior is applied:
If the source instance was created with a specified range, the cloned instance
is created in the same range.
If the source instance was not created with a specified range, the cloned instance
is created in a random range.
Troubleshoot
Issue
Troubleshooting
Cloning fails with constraints/sql.restrictAuthorizedNetworks error.
The cloning operation is blocked by the Authorized Networks configuration.
Authorized Networks are configured for public IP addresses in the Connectivity section
of the Google Cloud console, and cloning is not permitted due to
security considerations .
Remove all Authorized Networks entries from the Cloud SQL
instance if you can. Otherwise,
create a replica
without any Authorized Networks entries.
Error message: Failed to create subnetwork. Couldn't find free
blocks in allocated IP ranges. Please allocate new ranges for this service
provider. Help Token: [help-token-id].
You're trying to use the Google Cloud console to clone an instance with a private IP
address, but you didn't specify the allocated IP range that you want
to use and the source instance isn't created with the specified range. As
a result, the cloned instance is created in a random range.
Use gcloud to clone the instance and provide a value for
the --allocated-ip-range-name parameter. For more information,
see Cloning an instance with a private IP .
