MySQL

| SQL Server
You can use point-in-time-recovery (PITR) to restore your primary Cloud SQL
instances whether the instance is live, or is deleted. PITR lets you restore
the instance to a specific point-in-time. For a deleted instance, you
can restore the instance to a specific point-in-time to a new or existing
instance.
Cloud SQL provides the following options to restore your instance
using PITR:
Perform a PITR on a live instance
Perform a PITR using the backup vault
Perform a PITR on an unavailable instance
Perform a PITR on a deleted instance
Perform a PITR using binary log event positions
For performing a PITR on an unavailable or deleted instance, you'll need to
find the
latest and earliest recovery time .
Perform a PITR by a using timestamp
Using a timestamp is the recommended approach for performing
a PITR.
Cloud SQL uses the mysqlbinlog utility to restore
instances up to a specific time. For more information about the mysqlbinlog
utility, see the MySQL reference documentation .
To complete the following task, you must have the following:
Binary logging and backups enabled for the instance, with continuous binary
logs since the last backup before the event from which you want to recover.
For more information, see Enable binary logging .
A timestamp to define the recovery point. The events that occur at and after
this timestamp aren't reflected in the new instance.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Open the more actions menu for the instance you
want to recover and click Create clone .
Optionally, on the Create a clone page, update the ID of the
new clone.
Select Clone from an earlier point in time .
Enter a PITR time.
Click Create clone .
gcloud
Create a clone using PITR.
Replace the following:
SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME - Name of the instance you're
restoring from.
NEW_INSTANCE_NAME - Name for the clone.
TIMESTAMP - UTC timezone for the source instance in RFC
3339 format. For example, 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.

Perform a PITR using the backup vault
If your Cloud SQL instance is enabled to use
enhanced backups ,
then you can perform point-in-time-recovery for your instance using the
backup vault.
Note: If you're using Terraform or the Cloud SQL API to perform PITR
and your instance uses enhanced backups, then Cloud SQL uses the
PITR settings from the instance's associated backup plan.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Open the more actions menu for the instance you
want to recover and click Create clone .
Select Clone from an earlier point in time .
Enter a PITR time.
Click Create clone .
gcloud
To perform a PITR on an instance from the backup vault, you'll need to find the
data-source for the backup that is nearest to the time you want to perform
the PITR. To find the backup, see
List all the backups in the backup vault for an instance . Once you've identified the backup, run the following command to perform the PITR:
gcloud sql instances point - in - time - restore DATA_SOURCE TARGET_INSTANCE_NAME PITR_TIMESTAMP \
-- project = TARGET_PROJECT \
-- region = REGION
Replace the following:
DATA_SOURCE : the path of the data-source for the source instance.
that is closest to the PITR timestamp you want to recover to.
TARGET_INSTANCE_NAME : the name for the new instance that is created by the PITR operation.
PITR_TIMESTAMP : the UTC timestamp for the source
instance PITR log you want to restore your instance to, in
RFC 3339 format. For example, 2025-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.
TARGET_PROJECT : the project ID for the new instance.
REGION : the region of the target instance.
This field is required if the data source of source instance is located in a multi-region. The target instance region must be the same as the region of the source instance.

Perform a cross-project PITR
With enhanced backups, you can restore a Cloud SQL instance to a
project other than the one where either the source instance or backup vault is
located.
Cross-project PITR is supported only through the gcloud CLI and REST APIs.
To perform a cross-project PITR, do one of the following:
If you're using the gcloud CLI, set the --project flag to the
project where you want to create the target instance.
If you're using REST APIs, set the PROJECT_ID field to the project where
you want to create the target instance.
Perform PITR on an unavailable instance
Console
You might want to recover an
instance that isn't available
to a different zone because of the following reasons:
The zone in which the instance is configured isn't accessible. This
instance has a FAILED state.
The instance is undergoing maintenance. This instance has a
MAINTENANCE state.
To recover an unavailable instance, complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Find the row of the instance to clone.
In the Actions column, click the
more_vert More Actions menu.
Click Create clone .
On the Create a clone page, complete the following actions:
In the Instance ID field, update the instance ID, if needed.
Click Clone from an earlier point in time .
In the Point in time field, select a date and time from which you
want to clone data. This recovers the state of the instance from that point
in time.
Click Create clone .
While the clone initializes, you're returned to the instance listing page.

Perform a PITR by using binary log positions
While we recommend that you perform PITR using timestamps, as
described in Perform PITR by using a timestamp , you can also
perform PITR by providing a specific binary log position, or event position, in
a binary log file.
For more information about PITR using binary log positions, see
PITR Using the Binary Log .
Before you begin
Before completing this task, you must have:
Binary logging and backups enabled for the instance, with continuous binary
logs since the last backup before the event you want to recover from.
For more information, see Enable binary logging .
The binary logs must be available on disk for you to
browse them for events. To check the retention length of your binary logs on
disk, see Set transaction log retention .
For more information, see Log retention period .
You can't browse binary logs that are stored in Cloud Storage with the
mysqlbinlog utility.
A binary log filename and the position of the event you want to
recover from (that event and all events that came
after it aren't reflected in the new instance).
For more information, see Identify the binary log position .
After identifying the binary log filename and position,
perform the PITR using binary log event positions .
Identify the recovery position
Use the MySQL client to connect to the instance you want to restore to.
To do so, use the Cloud Shell or your local client machine.
For more information, see
Connection options for external applications .
Show the binary log files for the instance:
SHOW BINARY LOGS ;
Display the first 100 events in the most recent binary log file:
SHOW BINLOG EVENTS IN '<BINARY_LOG_FILE>' LIMIT 100 ;
You can adjust the number of rows to show, but don't show all of
the events in the file until you know how large the file is. Displaying a
large number of events can affect system performance.
If the event you're looking for isn't displayed, use the last position
displayed as the starting point to search the next set of events:
SHOW BINLOG EVENTS IN '<BINARY_LOG_FILE>' FROM < POSITION > LIMIT 100 ;
When you find the event that marks the point in time you want to restore up
to, record the position (shown as Pos ) and the name of the binary log file.
The binary log filename and the position are the values you use for the
PITR.
The following is a sample output from the SHOW BINLOG EVENTS command:
+------------------+-----+-------------+-----------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

16 rows in set (0.04 sec)
To restore up to the DROP TABLE statement, bolded in the previous
sample, you would use 865 in mysql-bin.000011 as the
recovery position. The DROP TABLE statement and all operations after
it are not reflected in the new instance.
Note: MySQL provides a more sophisticated tool for examining binary logs called
mysqlbinlog . It's available with the MySQL Server software. If you
have the MySQL Server installed, you can use it to determine the recovery
position you want to use. For more information, see
the MySQL documentation for mysqlbinlog .
Perform PITR using binary log event positions
gcloud
Use the
gcloud sql instances clone command with the
--bin-log-file-name and --bin-log-position
flags.
Create the new instance using the binary log filename and recovery
position.
Replace the following:
SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME : Name of the instance you're
restoring from.
NEW_INSTANCE_NAME : Name for the clone.
BINLOG_FILE_NAME : Name for the binary log, such as
mysql-bin.187288 .
POSITION : The position in the binary log to restore up
to, such as 50001356 .
gcloud sql instances clone SOURCE_INSTANCE_NAME \
NEW_INSTANCE_NAME \
--bin-log-file-name = " BINLOG_FILE_NAME " \
--bin-log-position = POSITION
For example, a gcloud sql instances clone command might look
similar to the following:
gcloud sql instances clone instance1 \
instance1-clone \
--bin-log-file-name = mysql-bin.0000031 \
--bin-log-position = 107 \
Use the operation ID returned from the clone command to
check the status of the restore operation.
gcloud sql operations describe OPERATION_ID
When the operation is in progress, a state of RUNNING is
returned. When the operation is complete, a state of DONE
is returned.

Get the earliest and latest recovery time
For an available instance, you can perform a PITR to any timestamp in the
instance's PITR window. The PITR window starts a the earliest recovery time
and ends at the latest recovery time. If the
instance is unavailable and the instance logs are stored in Cloud Storage ,
or the instance was deleted and had
PITR retention enabled ,
then you can retrieve the earliest and latest recovery time, and perform the
PITR to any timestamp in that window.
In all cases, you can restore the instance to a different primary or secondary zone
by providing values for the preferred zones.
