MySQL
| PostgreSQL
| SQL Server
The Cloud SQL Connectors are libraries that provide encryption and
Identity and Access Management (IAM)-based authorization when connecting to a
Cloud SQL instance. They can't provide a network path to a Cloud SQL
instance if one is not already present.
Other ways to connect to a Cloud SQL instance include
using a database client or the
Cloud SQL Auth Proxy . See
the About connection options
page for more information about connecting to a Cloud SQL instance.
This page discusses the following Cloud SQL Connectors:
The Cloud SQL Java Connector
The Cloud SQL Python Connector (Open in Colab)
The Cloud SQL Go Connector
The Cloud SQL Node.js Connector
Benefits
Using a Cloud SQL connector provides the following
benefits:
IAM authorization: Uses
IAM permissions to control who or
what can connect to your Cloud SQL instances.
Convenience: Removes the requirement to manage
SSL certificates, configure firewall rules, or enable authorized
networks.
Before you begin
Enable the Cloud SQL Admin API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Create a Cloud SQL instance, including configuring the default user.
For more information about creating instances, see
Create instances .
For more information about configuring the default user, see
Set the password for the default user account .
Configure the roles and
permissions required to connect to a Cloud SQL instance.
Note:
If the authorizing IAM principal belongs to a different
project than the one that contains the Cloud SQL instance, then you
must do the following:
Enable the Cloud SQL Admin API in both the projects.
Add the IAM permissions for the IAM
principal in the project that contains the Cloud SQL instance.
Setup
Java
The Cloud SQL Java Connector is a library that provides
IAM-based authorization and encryption when connecting to a
Cloud SQL instance. It can not provide a network path to a
Cloud SQL instance if one is not already present.
Install
For instructions on building and using the drivers for JDBC and R2DBC
with the Cloud SQL Java Connector, see the following links:
JDBC: Connecting to Cloud SQL using JDBC .
R2DBC: Connecting to Cloud SQL using R2DBC .
For examples of this library being used in the context of an application, check out these
sample applications .
Authenticate
This library uses Application Default Credentials
to authenticate the connection to the Cloud SQL server.
To activate credentials locally, use the following
gcloud command:
gcloud auth application-default login
Connect with Intellij
In order to connect IntelliJ
to your Cloud SQL instance, you will need to add the library as a jar with dependencies in the
Additional Files section on the driver settings page. For example, prebuilt fat jars can be found on the
Cloud SQL Java Connector Releases
page for this purpose.
Python
The Cloud SQL Python Connector is a library that can be used alongside a
database driver to allow users with sufficient permissions to connect to a
Cloud SQL database without having to manually allowlist IPs or manage
SSL certificates.
For interactive examples of using the Cloud SQL Python Connector, open the Cloud SQL Python Connector notebook .
The driver that MySQL supports is pymysql .
Install
To install the latest release of the Cloud SQL Python Connector, use the pip install command and specify the pymysql driver for your database:
pip install "cloud-sql-python-connector[pymysql]"
Authenticate
This library uses Application Default Credentials
to authenticate the connection to the Cloud SQL server.
To activate credentials locally, use the following
gcloud command:
gcloud auth application-default login
Go
The Cloud SQL Go connector is a Cloud SQL connector designed for use with
the Go language. For improved security, this connector uses robust,
manually authenticated TLS 1.3 encryption between the client connector
and the server-side proxy, independent of the database protocol.
Install
You can install this repo with go get :
go get cloud.google.com/go/cloudsqlconn
Node.js
The Node.js Connector is a library designed for use with the Node.js
runtime that allows you to connect securely to your Cloud SQL instance.
Install
You can install the library with npm install :
npm install @google-cloud/cloud-sql-connector

Enforce
By using connector enforcement , you can enforce using only the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or Cloud SQL Language Connectors to connect to Cloud SQL instances. With connector enforcement, Cloud SQL rejects direct connections to the database.
If you're using a Private Service Connect-enabled instance , then there's a limitation. If the instance has connector enforcement enabled, then you can't create read replicas for the instance. Similarly, if the instance has read replicas, then you can't enable connector enforcement for the instance.
gcloud
To enforce using only the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or Cloud SQL Language Connectors to connect to an instance, use the gcloud sql instances patch command:
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME \
--connector-enforcement = REQUIRED
Replace INSTANCE_NAME with the name of your Cloud SQL instance.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of your Cloud SQL instance
Note: By setting the value of the connectorEnforcement parameter to REQUIRED , all connections must use the Cloud SQL Language Connectors, including the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy and the Java, Python, Go, and Node.js connectors.
HTTP method and URL:
PATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME
Request JSON body:
{
"kind": "sql#instance",
"name": INSTANCE_NAME ,
"project": PROJECT_ID ,
"settings": {
"connectorEnforcement": "REQUIRED",
"kind": "sql#settings"
}
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method PATCH ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME " | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"kind": "sql#operation",
"targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME ",
"status": "PENDING",
"user": "user@example.com",
"insertTime": "2020-01-16T02:32:12.281Z",
"operationType": "UPDATE",
"name": " OPERATION_ID ",
"targetId": " INSTANCE_NAME ",
"selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /operations/ OPERATION_ID ",
"targetProject": " PROJECT_ID "
}
Troubleshoot
Driver versions
Make sure you are using the latest version of the Cloud SQL Connectors
and your database driver to avoid incompatibilities. Some older versions
of drivers are not supported.
Connection paths
The Cloud SQL Connectors provide authorization for connections, but they
don't provide new paths to connectivity. For example, in order to
connect to a Cloud SQL instance using a Private IP address, your
application must already have VPC access.
Debug connection issues
For additional help with connection issues, see the
Troubleshoot
and Debug connection issues
pages.
