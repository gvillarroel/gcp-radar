Legacy configuration for high availability

MySQL
| PostgreSQL
| SQL Server
Important: As of January 13, 2025, the
legacy configuration for high availability (HA) is deprecated for all instances.
You can't create instances with legacy high availability configuration, and you can't
enable legacy high availability configuration on any existing instances.
In addition, after January 13, 2025, legacy high availability instances
are no longer covered by the Cloud SQL SLA .
We recommend that you
update your remaining legacy high availability instances to the current high availability configuration.
You can do so by following the instructions in
Update an instance from legacy to current high availability .
Starting on May 1, 2025, Cloud SQL will begin updating any
instances that use the legacy high availability configuration to use the current regional
persistent disk-based high availability configuration automatically.
This page describes the legacy configuration for a MySQL instance for high availability (HA).
In a legacy HA configuration,
a Cloud SQL for MySQL instance uses a failover replica to add high availability to the instance.
This feature isn't available in Google Cloud console. The recommended configuration doesn't use
failover replicas. Instead, the current high availability configuration uses Google
regional persistent disks , which synchronously
replicate data at the block-level between two zones in a region.
For more information about the current high availability configuration, see
Overview of the High Availability Configuration .
Update an instance from legacy to current high availability
To update your instance from the legacy to the current high availability
configuration, do the following:
Update your instance to the current high availability configuration.
Delete the failover replica for the MySQL instance you want to update.
For more information, see Disable high availability on an instance .
Configure the primary instance to use the current version of high availability.
For more information, see Configure an existing instance for high availability .
As another option, use Database Migration Service to migrate to an instance
that uses the current high availability configuration.
Create a read replica instance
to offload any read workloads that you don't want to perform on the primary instance.
Initiate failover
Testing failover is optional, but is recommended so that you can see how your
application responds in the event of a failover.
Note: This feature helps you test your application's response to an automatic
failover. Make sure your instance has completed any previous failover (so it is
responding to connection requests) before you trigger another failover.
To learn more about failovers, see the
Failover overview .
gcloud
Initiate the failover:
gcloud sql instances failover PRIMARY_INSTANCE_NAME
curl
Describe the primary instance to get the value of the
settingsVersion field.
gcloud auth login
ACCESS_TOKEN = " $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) "
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ ACCESS_TOKEN } " \
-X GET \
https://www.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT-ID /instances/ PRIMARY_INSTANCE_NAME
Initiate the failover:
gcloud auth login
ACCESS_TOKEN = " $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) "
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ ACCESS_TOKEN } " \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"failoverContext":{"settingsVersion":" SETTINGS_VERSION "}}' \
-X POST \
https://www.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT-ID /instances/ PRIMARY_INSTANCE_NAME /failover
The instance fails over and is not available to serve data for a few minutes.
Legacy configuration: Create an alert for replication lag
The time required for a failover operation depends on the amount of replication
lag when the failover is initiated. You can use Cloud Monitoring in the
Google Cloud console to alert you when replication lag exceeds a threshold.
Note: Failover downtime caused by replication lag greater than 1200 seconds is
not counted against the SLA for the instance.
For more information about replication lag, search for "seconds_behind_master"
on the
SHOW SLAVE STATUS Syntax
page in the MySQL documentation.
For more information about Cloud Monitoring, see
the Cloud Monitoring documentation .
Note: A newly created Cloud SQL instance can take time to appear in
the Cloud Monitoring interface. If you don't see a new instance, then
check again in an hour.
Legacy configuration: Set an alert for a specific failover replica
In the navigation panel of the Google Cloud console,
select Monitoring , and then select Alerting .
Click Create Alerting Policy .
Enter a descriptive name for your alert.
Select Metric Threshold and click Next to open the Target tab.
For Resource Type , select Cloud SQL .
For Applies To , select Single , then select your failover replica.
Click Next to open the Configuration tab.
Enter the following values:
Field
Value
If Metric
Seconds Behind Master
Condition
above
Thresholds
120 (or whatever value is appropriate for your environment)
For
3 minutes
Select your Notification methods, and click Save Condition .
Legacy configuration: Set an alert for a group of failover replicas
If you plan to create multiple failover replicas in the same project, it could
be easier to set the alert for the entire group, rather than on each failover
replica individually. To create a group for monitoring, use a suffix for the
failover replicas' names, such as "-failover". Make sure you don't use this
suffix for any other types of Cloud SQL instances.
Create your failover replica group:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Monitoring page.
Go to Monitoring
From the upper menu bar, select Groups > Create... .
Enter a descriptive name for your group.
Leave Name and Contains selected, and enter your name substring.
Click Save Group . The summary page for the new group opens.
Confirm that the expected instances are included in the group.
Note: If you open the Groups Overview page, where all existing groups are
listed, then your group shows 0 instances. This is because Cloud Monitoring
uses the term
"instances" to mean VMs and VM clusters. Cloud SQL instances are shown
under Resources .
Create the alert for the failover replica group:
In the navigation panel of the Google Cloud console,
select Monitoring , and then select Alerting .
Click Create Alerting Policy .
Enter a descriptive name for your group alert.
Select Metric Threshold and click Next to open the Target tab.
For Resource Type , select Cloud SQL .
For Applies To , select Group , then select your failover group.
Leave Any Member Violates selected and click Next to open the
Configuration tab.
Enter the following values:
Field
Value
If Metric
Seconds Behind Master
Condition
above
Thresholds
120 (or whatever value is appropriate for your environment)
For
3 minutes
Select your desired Notification methods, and click Save Condition .
Legacy configuration: Disable high availability on an instance
You need to delete the failover replica instance to remove high availability from the
primary instance.
Before you perform this procedure, make sure there are no operations currently
running on the primary instance.
To disable high availability:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
Select the failover instance associated with the instance you want to
disable high availability on.
On the Instance details page, click Delete .
In the Delete Replica window, retype the name of failover
instance.
Click Delete . The configuration for the original instance changes
to zonal.
gcloud
For reference information, see gcloud sql instances delete .
gcloud sql instances delete FAILOVER_REPLICA_NAME
curl
The following request uses the instances:delete method to delete the instance.
gcloud auth login
ACCESS_TOKEN = " $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) "
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ ACCESS_TOKEN } " \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-X DELETE \
https://www.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT-ID /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME
