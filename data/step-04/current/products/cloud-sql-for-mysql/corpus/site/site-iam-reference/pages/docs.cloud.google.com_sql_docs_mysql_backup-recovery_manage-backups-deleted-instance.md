Manage backups for deleted instances

MySQL

| SQL Server
You can manage backups after an instance is deleted if you elected to
retain backups after instance deletion ,
or took a final backup
prior to deleting your instance. Retained backups include automated and
on-demand backups that were taken when the instance was live. When you delete
your instance, these backups become independent of your instance and are stored
at the project level. For more information about how backups work and which
backups are retained, see
Cloud SQL backups overview .
You can use these backups to restore an instance
after your instance is deleted.
Before you begin
To manage retained backups in a Google Cloud project, you need the following
permissions:

List all backups for a deleted instance
You can see a list of all retained and final backups for a deleted instance
for your Google Cloud console project. Backups include details such as the name of
the backup, the instance it belonged to, the type of backup, and the time
the instance was deleted. Since the name of a deleted instance can be reused
after its been deleted, we recommend using the
instance deletion time field to differentiate which instance a particular
backup belongs to. For a live instance, this field is blank.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Backups page.
Go to Cloud SQL Backups
Select your instance's backup option :
standard tier or enhanced tier .
Click Filter , then Instance status , and select
Deleted instance .
This page lists all deleted instances in your
Google Cloud console project.
Click the name of the deleted instance you want to view backups for.
This page lists all retained automed and on-demand backups, and the
final backup, if available, for your deleted instance.
gcloud
To get a list of all backups that are associated with a Google Cloud project,
use the gcloud sql backups list
command:
gcloud sql backups list
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project.
To view details about a specific retained backup, use the
gcloud sql backups describe
command:
gcloud sql backups describe BACKUP_NAME
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
BACKUP_NAME : the name of your retained backup.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project.

Update a retained or final backup after instance deletion
After you delete an instance, you can update the settings for any retained or final backups
associated with that instance that are stored at the project level. Depending
on the type of backup, the details you can update might be different.
You can update the description and the retention settings of a final backup
taken prior to deleting your instance. However, for on-demand or automated
backups that are retained after instance deletion, you can only update the
description of for these backups. For retained backups, the retention settings
are set based on the retention settings of the backups when the instance
was live. For more information, see
Retain backups after instance deletion .
Update a final backup
You can update the retention settings and the description of a final backup
taken before an instance is deleted. To update the backup, do the following:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Backups page.
Go to Cloud SQL Backups
Click the name of the deleted instance you want to view backups for.
You will see a list of all retained and final backups, and their
details for the deleted instance.
For the final backup you want to update, click more actions
, and then do the following:
If you want to edit the description of the final backup, click
Edit description .
Enter the description in the Describe this backup field, then
click Update .
If you want to edit the retention period for the final backup,
click Edit retention period .
Select the date in the Retain backup until field. The retention
period can range from 1 to 365 days after instance deletion. Once
you select the date to retain the backup until, click Update .
gcloud
You'll need the backup-name of the final backup you want to update.
To get the backup-name , see
List backups for a deleted instance .
To update the retention period or the description of a final backup, use
the gcloud sql backups patch
command and specify either the expiry-time or the ttl-days for
the backup:
gcloud sql backups patch BACKUP_NAME
--description= BACKUP_DESCRIPTION
--expiry-time= EXPIRY_TIME | --ttl-days= TTL_DAYS
Replace the following:
BACKUP_NAME : the name of the final backup.
BACKUP_DESCRIPTION : the new description you want to
add to final backup.
One of the following:
EXPIRY_TIME : the new date and time for when you
want the final backup to be deleted. The maximum time is 365 days
from instance deletion.
TTL_DAYS : the number of days you want to retain your
final backup. This can range from 1 to 365 days, where the default is
30 days.
