Cloud SQL provides a REST API for administering your instances
programmatically. The REST API is defined by BackupRuns, Databases, Instances,
Flags, Operations, SslCerts, Tiers, and Users resources. Each resource supports
methods for accessing and working with it. For example, the Instances resource
supports methods such as get, insert, and list. For details of all the resources
and their methods, see the
Cloud SQL Admin API Reference .
Important: The Cloud SQL Admin API v1 is now generally available. It is
and will continue to be compatible with the v1beta4 version. There is no
requirement to migrate from v1beta4 to the v1 Admin API.
When you send requests directly to the Cloud SQL REST API, you must create the
correct form of the request, authorize the request as an authenticated user, and
process any responses returned. Many of the tasks in this documentation provide
API examples using cURL .
For more examples of using the APIs, see the page for the request in the
Cloud SQL Admin API Reference . Each page has
examples calling the API in several programming languages, as well as a
request-specific Explorer to help you see what goes into a well-formed request
and what to expect in the response.
You are also using the Cloud SQL Admin API, indirectly, when you use any of the
following ways of administering instances:
gcloud CLI , which contains a command-line
interface you can use to work with your instances.
One of the Client Libraries , such
as for Java, Python, or .NET.
Google Cloud console , a graphical web interface.
The advantage of using these methods, especially the
Google Cloud console, is that they can greatly simplify administering your
instances (depending on your use case). If you are just starting out with
Cloud SQL, we recommend that you start with one of these tools first
before working with the REST API directly.
Enable the API
To use the Cloud SQL Admin API, you need to enable it:
Console
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Select your project.
Select Continue .
gcloud
Enter the following to display the project IDs for your Google Cloud
projects:
gcloud projects list
Set your default project:
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
Enable the Cloud SQL Admin API:
gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
Authorize requests
Your application needs to identify itself every time it sends a request to
the Cloud SQL Admin API, by including an API key with each
request.
Acquiring and using an API key
To acquire an API key:
Open the Credentials page in the Google Cloud console.
This API supports two types of credentials.
Create whichever credentials are appropriate for your project:
OAuth 2.0: Whenever your application requests private user
data, it must send an OAuth 2.0 token along with the request. Your
application first sends a client ID and, possibly, a client secret to
obtain a token. You can generate OAuth 2.0 credentials for web
applications, service accounts, or installed applications.
Note: Since this API doesn't have any methods
that require OAuth 2.0 authorization, you might only need to obtain
API keys , which are described
below. However, if your application calls other APIs that require user
authorization, then you still need OAuth 2.0 credentials.
For more information, see the OAuth 2.0 documentation .
API keys:
A request that does not provide an OAuth 2.0 token must send an API
key.
The key identifies your project and provides API access, quota, and
reports.
The API supports several types of restrictions on API keys. If the API key that you
need doesn't already exist, then create an API key in the Console by
clicking Create credentials
> API key . You can restrict the key before using it
in production by clicking Restrict key and selecting one of the
Restrictions .
To keep your API keys secure, follow the best practices for
securely using API keys .
After you have an API key, your application can append the query parameter
key= yourAPIKey to all request URLs.
The API key is safe for embedding in URLs; it doesn't need any encoding.
Note: For more information on authorizing requests, see
Authorize Requests .
Permissions
In addition to authorization, the principal must have the required permissions
for the API request. For more information, see
IAM permissions in Cloud SQL .
API examples
You can see examples of using the API with cURL on the REST v1 and the
REST v1beta4 tabs in the How-to Guides for
this documentation set.
Provide JSON data from a file
When you use the API with cURL, you provide property values using the command
line. If you are working with sensitive values such as passwords or security
keys, providing them on the command line poses a security risk. For increased
security, you can create a file containing the JSON data for the API call, and
provide the path to the file on the command line.
To provide JSON data to your cURL API call from a file:
Create a file containing everything enclosed in the single quotes for the
--data field.
Include the curly brackets, but do not include the single quotes.
At the command line, provide the path to the file, preceded by the
@ character, as the --data parameter:
--data @<path-to-file>/<filename>
For example, to create a database user, you could create a file
named data.json with the following content:
{"host": "%", "name": "user1", "password": "abc123"}
Then you would use the following cURL command at the command line:
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ ACCESS_TOKEN } " \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data @./data.json \
-X POST \
https://www.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/myProject/instances/myInstance/users
Work with long-running API calls
Some API calls, such as object creation, can take some time to complete. Because
the API is asynchronous, the call returns immediately, even if the operation is
still in progress. If a subsequent API call uses the newly created object, you
must wait for the first operation to complete before proceeding.
You can wait programmatically by using the operation resource, which is returned
for all insert calls. Provide the value of the name property to the operation
get method and inspect the
status of the operation, When the status property changes from PENDING to
DONE , you can access the newly created object.
Cloud SQL and Google APIs Discovery Service
Google APIs Discovery Service is a service that you can use to
discover Google APIs. For example, when you use the Google APIs Explorer
tool, you are using the Discovery Service. In the Discovery
Service, Cloud SQL is represented as "sqladmin" (for example:
https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/ sqladmin /v1beta4/sql.operation).
This is different than the base path "sql" that you use in requests to the REST
API (for example:
https://www.googleapis.com/ sql /v1beta4/projects/example-id/instances).
Some client libraries also use the Discovery Service. In the client creation
code, be sure to use "sqladmin" to access the correct discovery document. For
more information, see
Client Libraries .
Use VPC Service Controls with the Cloud SQL Admin API
VPC Service Controls let you create a service perimeter around the
Cloud SQL Admin API to help mitigate data
exfiltration. The service perimeter allows free communication within the
perimeter, but blocks all communication across the perimeter.
Before adding VPC Service Controls, it is recommended that you enable private IP
and disable public IP on the Cloud SQL instances that you plan to add to
the service perimeter. These requirements also apply to clones, read replicas,
and failover replicas.
See Configure VPC Service Controls .
