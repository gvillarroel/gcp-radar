The Cloud SQL Admin API is built on HTTP and JSON, so any standard HTTP client can
send requests to it and parse the responses. However, instead of creating HTTP
requests and parsing responses manually, you may want to use the Google APIs
client libraries. The client libraries provide better language integration,
improved security, and support for making calls that require user authorization.
Client libraries can use
Application Default Credentials
to easily authenticate with Google APIs and send requests to those APIs. With
Application Default Credentials, you can test your application locally and
deploy it without changing the underlying code. For more information, see
Authenticate for using client libraries .
Application Default Credentials are part of the client libraries you can use to
access Cloud SQL. Default credentials identify your application with either a
user credential or a default service account. When working with a library, it's
typical to choose credentials based on the type of environment where
you run code. For example, in a development environment, you can authenticate
with the gcloud auth command and the client libraries will use those
credentials. For more information about environments, see
Authentication overview in the Google Cloud Platform Auth Guide .
Access the service
Depending on the Cloud SQL Admin API client library you use, you may need to
configure how the library discovers the default service path. For client
libraries that use the Google APIs Discovery Service, use the API name
sqladmin to build a client. This includes libraries for Python and JavaScript.
The following code snippets show how to create a client and list
Cloud SQL instances in a project.
C++
For the C++ Client Library ,
follow Setting up a C++ development environment to install the
library.
#include "google/cloud/sql/v1/sql_instances_client.h"
#include "google/cloud/project.h"
#include <iostream>
int main ( int argc , char * argv []) try {
if ( argc != 2 ) {
std :: cerr << "Usage: " << argv [ 0 ] << " project-id \n " ;
return 1 ;
}
namespace sql = :: google :: cloud :: sql_v1 ;
auto client = sql :: SqlInstancesServiceClient (
sql :: MakeSqlInstancesServiceConnectionRest ());
google :: cloud :: sql :: v1 :: SqlInstancesListRequest request ;
request . set_project ( argv [ 1 ]);
for ( auto database : client . List ( request )) {
if ( ! database ) throw std :: move ( database ). status ();
std :: cout << database - > DebugString () << " \n " ;
}
return 0 ;
} catch ( google :: cloud :: Status const & status ) {
std :: cerr << "google::cloud::Status thrown: " << status << " \n " ;
return 1 ;
}
Java
For the Client Library for Java ,
you can optionally specify the service path directly.
// Set up global SQLAdmin instance.
client = new SQLAdmin.Builder(httpTransport, JSON_FACTORY, credential)
.setServicePath(" sql/v1beta4/ ")
.setApplicationName(APPLICATION_NAME).build();
InstancesListResponse resp = client.instances().list("PROJECT_ID").execute();
List<DatabaseInstance> list = resp.getItems();
for (DatabaseInstance d : list) {
System.out.println(d.getName());
}
Go
For the Client Library for Go ,
import the sqladmin package.
func ListInstances ( projectId string ) ([] * sqladmin . DatabaseInstance , error ) {
ctx := context . Background ()
// Create an http.Client that uses Application Default Credentials.
hc , err := google . DefaultClient ( ctx , sqladmin . SqlserviceAdminScope )
if err != nil {
return nil , err
}
// Create the Google Cloud SQL service.
service , err := sqladmin . New ( hc )
if err != nil {
return nil , err
}
// List instances for the project ID.
instances , err := service . Instances . List ( projectId ). Do ()
if err != nil {
return nil , err
}
return instances . Items , nil
}
Java
For the Client Library for Java ,
you can optionally specify the service path directly.
// Set up global SQLAdmin instance.
client = new SQLAdmin.Builder(httpTransport, JSON_FACTORY, credential)
.setApplicationName(APPLICATION_NAME).build();
InstancesListResponse resp = client.instances().list("PROJECT_ID").execute();
List<DatabaseInstance> list = resp.getItems();
for (DatabaseInstance d : list) {
System.out.println(d.getName());
}
JavaScript
For the Client Library for JavaScript ,
specify sqladmin to build a client.
gapi.client.load(' sqladmin ', 'v1beta4', function() { console.log('loaded');});
gapi.client.sql.instances.list({'project': PROJECT_ID}).execute(showResult);
function showResult(result) {
// Process the result.
};
Python
For the Client Library for Python ,
specify sqladmin to build a client.
from googleapiclient import discovery
# Construct the service object for the interacting with the Cloud SQL Admin API.
service = discovery.build(' sqladmin ', 'v1beta4', http=http)
req = service.instances().list(project="PROJECT_ID")
resp = req.execute()
print(json.dumps(resp, indent=2))
The service object queries the discovery document and uses the correct
service path, in this case, "sql/v1beta4/projects/".

Cloud SQL, see the Connecting overview page.
