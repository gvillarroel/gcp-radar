This page describes how to use the authorized networks settings for connecting
to Cloud SQL instances that use IP addresses.
Configure authorized networks
Your client application's IP address or address range must be configured as
authorized networks for the following conditions:
Your client application is connecting directly to a
Cloud SQL instance on its public IP address.
Your client application is connecting directly to a
Cloud SQL instance on its private IP address, and your client's
IP address is a non-RFC 1918 address
The IP address can be either a single endpoint or consist of a range in
CIDR notation .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Go to Cloud SQL Instances
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
From the SQL navigation menu, select Connections .
Click the Networking tab.
Select the Public IP checkbox.
In the Authorized networks section, expand New IP range .
In the Name field, enter a name for the New IP range .
In the IP range field, enter the public IPv4 address or address
range from which you want to allow connections.
Alternatively, click Use My IP to let Cloud SQL populate
the IPv4 address of the client machine from which you are accessing
Google Cloud.
The Use my IP option isn't available for clients that use IPv6
addresses.
For the address range, you must use a valid
CIDR notation (for example, 10.10.10.0/24).
Click Done .
Click Save .
gcloud
Configuring authorized networks replaces the existing authorized networks
list.
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_ID \
--authorized-networks = NETWORK_RANGE_1 , NETWORK_RANGE_2 ...
Terraform
To configure authorized networks, use a Terraform resource .
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "instance" {
name = "mysql-instance-with-authorized-network"
region = "us-central1"
database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
settings {
tier = "db-f1-micro"
ip_configuration {
authorized_networks {
name = "Network Name"
value = "192.0.2.0/24"
expiration_time = "3021-11-15T16:19:00.094Z"
}
}
}
# set `deletion_protection` to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by
# use of Terraform whereas `deletion_protection_enabled` flag protects this instance at the GCP level.
deletion_protection = false
}
Apply the changes
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell .
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT= PROJECT_ID
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module ).
In Cloud Shell , create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension—for example main.tf . In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf .
mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf .
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
terraform init
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
terraform init -upgrade
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
terraform plan
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
terraform apply
Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete!" message.
Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
Note: Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are
enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Delete the changes
To delete your changes, do the following:
To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the
deletion_protection argument to false .
deletion_protection = "false"
Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and
entering yes at the prompt:
terraform apply
Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following
command and entering yes at the prompt:
terraform destroy
REST v1
Configuring authorized networks replaces the existing authorized networks
list.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
project-id : The project ID
instance-id : The instance ID
network_range_1 An authorized ip address or range
network_range_2 Another authorized ip address or range
HTTP method and URL:
PATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id
Request JSON body:
{
"settings":
{
"ipConfiguration":
{
"authorizedNetworks":
[{"value": " network_range_1 "}, {"value": " network_range_2 "}]
}
}
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method PATCH ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id " | Select-Object -Expand Content

Limitations
Some IP address ranges can't be added as authorized networks.
Address range
Notes
10.0.0.0/8
RFC 1918 address range. These are automatically and implicitly
included in the authorized networks by Cloud SQL
172.16.0.0/12
RFC 1918 address range. These are automatically and implicitly
included in the authorized networks by Cloud SQL
192.168.0.0/16
RFC 1918 address range. These are automatically and implicitly
included in the authorized networks by Cloud SQL
Note: The authorized networks list is implemented on
the Cloud SQL instance VM by a local firewall. Learn more about
managing
connections .
Cloud SQL doesn't support IPv6 authorized networks. If your client
machine uses the IPv6 protocol, then the optional Use my IP button isn't
available in the Networking tab of the Google Cloud console.
If you're using a VPN or proxy server, then the Use my IP option
doesn't display the client machine's actual IP address. This is by design.
