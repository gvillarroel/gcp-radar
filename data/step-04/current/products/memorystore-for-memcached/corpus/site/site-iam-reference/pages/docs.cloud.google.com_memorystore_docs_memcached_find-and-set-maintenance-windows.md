Memorystore for Memcached is being deprecated and will be shut down on January 31, 2029. After February 1, 2027, you can't create Memorystore for Memcached instances in new projects unless these instances already exist in these projects. We recommend that you migrate your workloads to Memorystore for Valkey , which offers superior performance and features.

Find and set maintenance windows
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides instructions how to find scheduled maintenance, set
maintenance windows, reschedule planned maintenance, and more.
For an overview of maintenance updates and maintenance windows, see Maintenance policy .
Set a preferred window for maintenance on an instance
Console
Go to the Memorystore for Memcached page in the Google Cloud console.
Memorystore for Memcached
Click the instance ID of the instance you want to set a maintenance window
for.
Click Edit .
Under the Maintenance section, select the desired day, time, and
duration for the maintenance window. The time is set in your local time
zone.
Click Save .
gcloud
Run the following command to set a maintenance window for a Memcached instance:
gcloud memcache instances update INSTANCE_ID --region= REGION --maintenance-window-day= DAY --maintenance-window-start-time= START_TIME --maintenance-window-duration= DURATION
Where:
INSTANCE_ID is the ID of the instance.
REGION is the region where your instance is located.
DAY is the day you want maintenance to occur. Acceptable values
are: MONDAY , TUESDAY , WEDNESDAY , THURSDAY , FRIDAY , SATURDAY , SUNDAY .
START_TIME is the hour of day (0 to 23) for the start of
the maintenance window, in the UTC time zone.
DURATION is a window between 3 and 8 hours in length. Acceptable
values are 3h through 8h , integers only.
For reference information, see gcloud memcached instances update
Opt in to maintenance notifications
Note: Even if you turn on maintenance notifications, you do not receive
notifications unless you set a maintenance window
for that instance.
To turn on maintenance notifications:
Go to the Communication page in the Google Cloud console:
Communication
Click the Product Notifications tab.
Select your project from the dropdown menu.
In the row for Memorystore, toggle the email button to ON .
A maintenance notification email uses the title, "Upcoming maintenance for your
Cloud Memorystore instance [your-instance-name]" . Each person who needs to
needs to receive notifications must opt in separately.
Maintenance notifications are set at the project level rather than on instances.
Email notifications are sent to the email address associated with your Google
account. It is not possible to configure a custom email alias (for instance, a
team email alias).
Find scheduled maintenance
If maintenance has been scheduled for your instance, you can view it using the
following instructions:
Console
Go to the Memorystore for Memcached page in the Google Cloud console.
Memorystore for Memcached
Click the instance ID of the instance that you want to view scheduled
maintenance for.
Under the Maintenance section, you can view the date and time of any
scheduled maintenance updates.
gcloud
gcloud memcache instances describe INSTANCE-ID --region= REGION
where:
INSTANCE_ID is the ID of the instance
REGION is the region where your instance is located
The output for scheduled maintenance is as follows:
maintenancePolicy:
createTime: 'TIME_STAMP'
updateTime: 'TIME_STAMP'
maintenanceWindow:
- day: DAY
duration: 180 minutes
hour: HOUR
maintenanceSchedule:
endTime: 'TIME_STAMP'
startTime: 'TIME_STAMP'
Where:
maintenancePolicy shows information on the creation time of your
preferred maintenance policy and the last time the policy was updated.
createTime is when the maintenance policy is first created.
updateTime is when the maintenance policy was last updated.
DAY indicates the day of the week maintenance occurs.
duration indicates the length of the maintenance window in minutes.
HOUR indicates the hour in UTC time that maintenance begins.
startTime indicates the specific start time for a maintenance update
that is scheduled for your instance.
endTime indicates the specific ending time for a maintenance update that
is scheduled for your instance.
TIME_STAMP uses the RFC 3339 format.
Reschedule planned maintenance
Caution: if you programmatically reschedule maintenance in bulk requests (not
natively supported by Memorystore for Memcached), limit batch reschedule sizes to
100 instances per batch. For more information, see Rescheduling maintenance .
To reschedule maintenance, see the instructions below:
Console
Go to the Memorystore for Memcached page in the Google Cloud console.
Memorystore for Memcached
Click the instance ID of the instance you want to reschedule maintenance
for.
Under the Maintenance section, click RESCHEDULE .
You can only reschedule maintenance if you have a scheduled update ,
for your instance.
Choose between Update now , Defer to next scheduled window , and
Custom day and time . For more information, see the overview of rescheduling maintenance .
If you want to update your instance immediately, select Update now
and click Update .
If you want to delay the scheduled maintenance by one week, select
Defer to the next scheduled window and click Reschedule .
If you want to designate a specific time, select Custom day and time ,
choose the new time, and click Reschedule .
gcloud
gcloud memcache instances reschedule-maintenance INSTANCE_ID --region= REGION --reschedule-type= RESCHEDULE_TYPE [--schedule-time= RESHEDULE_TIME ]
where:
INSTANCE_ID is the ID of the instance
REGION is the region where your instance is located
RESCHEDULE_TYPE is the type of rescheduled update. Available values are:
IMMEDIATE : Starts the maintenance update immediately
NEXT_AVAILABLE_WINDOW : Defers maintenance until the next maintenance
window. The next window is one week from the window in which maintenance
was originally scheduled
SPECIFIC_TIME : Allows you to designate a specific time for the update.
The rescheduled time must be no more than seven days from time of the
original maintenance window
RESHEDULE_TIME You can only specify this value if you set --reschedule-type to SPECIFIC TIME . This value uses the ISO 1801 format. For example, 2020-01-16T16:56:00.000Z . The time is set in UTC time.
For reference information, see gcloud memcache instances reschedule-maintenance .
Manually applying maintenance updates
After you receive a notification of upcoming maintenance you have the option
to apply the maintenance update to nodes manually. Manual maintenance is only
available after a maintenance event is scheduled for your instance, and you must
opt in to maintenance notifications and set a maintenance window to be informed
of this upcoming maintenance. For more information, see Manual maintenance .
Updating individual nodes in the Memcached cluster
To update individual nodes in your cluster, run the following command, replacing
VARIABLES with appropriate values:
gcloud beta memcache instances apply-software-update INSTANCE_NAME --node-ids= NODE_ID_1 , NODE_ID_2 --region= REGION
Updating all nodes in the Memcached cluster
To update all nodes in your cluster, run the following command, replacing
VARIABLES with appropriate values:
gcloud beta memcache instances apply-software-update INSTANCE_NAME --apply-all --region= REGION
Checking for available updates and verifying node updates
Signing up for maintenance notifications is the best way to learn when an update
is available, but you can also use the command to below to manually check if
maintenance is available. The following command also shows what nodes have been
updated for your instance.
gcloud memcache instances describe INSTANCE_NAME --region= REGION --format="table(updateAvailable.yesno(yes="YES",no="NO"),memcacheNodes:format='table(nodeId,updateAvailable.yesno(yes="YES", no="NO"))')"

required to manage maintenance windows for your Memcached instance.
