Memorystore for Memcached is being deprecated and will be shut down on January 31, 2029. After February 1, 2027, you can't create Memorystore for Memcached instances in new projects unless these instances already exist in these projects. We recommend that you migrate your workloads to Memorystore for Valkey , which offers superior performance and features.

Instance and node properties
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page lists the properties of Memorystore for Memcached instances and
nodes, as well as the possible values for those properties.
Instance settings
The following table lists the settings that you can modify for your
Memorystore for Memcached instances and nodes.
Setting
Possible Values
Instance ID
Compose of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
Must start with a letter.
Cannot exceed 40 characters.
Display name
Optional. The display name of the instance cannot exceed 80 characters.
Labels
String key/value pairs. Keys must start with a lowercase character and can
contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers.
Network association
A network from your project, or a shared VPC network.
Number of nodes
1-20
Cores/vCPUs per node
Minimum: 1 or 2 vCPUs depending on the region
Maximum: 32 vCPUs
With the exception of a single vCPU (depending on the region), you must
provision vCPUs in even numbers. For example, 1 vCPU, 2 vCPUs, 12 vCPUs,
and 26 vCPUs can be acceptable values.
Memory per node
Minimum: 1 GB or (0.9 GB * vCPUs per node), whichever is greater.
Maximum: 256 GB.
Note: Memory per node is constrained by the
number of vCPUs that the node has. You can provision up to 8 GB of memory for
every vCPU and must provision at least 0.9 GB for every vCPU. Therefore, to
reach the maximum memory per node of 256 GB, you need to
provision 32 vCPUs for each node.
Region
The Google Cloud region in which you want to deploy your instance
Zones
Optional. The zone(s) within a region where you want to deploy your node(s).
Memcached version
The Memcached version your instance uses. Available versions are 1.5.16 and 1.6.15 . For more information, see Supported versions .
Minimum vCPU according to region
Nodes in your Memcached instances have a minimum vCPU count of 2, except for the
following regions whose minimum is 1 vCPU:

Output fields
The following tables list the output properties of instances and nodes that you
can query to learn about an instance or node. To view these properties, run
the following command, replacing the variables with appropriate
values:
gcloud memcache instances describe instance-id --region= region
Instance property
Description
memcacheFullVersion:
Memcached version used in the instance. For a list of available versions, see Supported versions .
state:
Instances can be in the following states:
Creating : Instance is being created.
Ready : Instance is ready to be used in Memcached clients.
Deleting : Instance is being deleted.
zones:
User designated zones in which nodes are provisioned.
Node property
Description
memcacheFullVersion:
Memcached version used by the node. For a list of available versions, see Supported versions .
nodeID:
Auto-generated ID of the Memcached node used to view node-level metrics in Cloud Monitoring.
state:
Nodes can be in the following states:
Creating : Node is being created.
Ready : Node is ready to be used in Memcached clients. If a node is undergoing a repair by the Memorystore for Memcached system, that state will not be reflected here.
Deleting : Node is being deleted.
zone:
The Google Cloud zone where the node is located.
