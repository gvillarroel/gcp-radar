This page provides an overview of maintenance for Memorystore for Memcached.
For instructions on scheduling maintenance windows, see Finding and setting maintenance windows .
Overview
Memorystore for Memcached routinely updates instances to ensure that the service is
reliable, performant, secure, and up-to-date. Most of these updates are
performed while your Memcached instance is up and running. However, certain
system updates require a brief service interruption to be performed. These
updates are called maintenance . Maintenance typically falls into the following
categories:
Memorystore features. To launch some features,
Memorystore requires a maintenance update.
Operating system patches. We continuously monitor for newly identified
security vulnerabilities in the operating system. Upon discovery, we patch the
operating system to protect you from new risks.
Database version upgrades. Maintenance can include an OSS
Memcached patch minor version update which does not include breaking or
incompatible changes.
Users have two ways to perform maintenance: automatically or manually. The
maintenance windows
feature allows users to specify a recurring time frame when maintenance can be
automatically scheduled and performed. For users who want finer control over
their instance's maintenance, manual maintenance
provides a gcloud interface for updating an instance based on your desired
schedule and logic.
Impact of maintenance
During maintenance, a Memorystore for Memcached cluster experiences dropped
connections and a full cache flush.
The nodes in your cluster are updated sequentially and evenly across the entire
duration of your maintenance window. When a node is updated the cache is flushed
and data is not restored post maintenance. The downtime is usually on the order
of 5 minutes per node.
When a node undergoes maintenance, the connection is dropped and reset for that
node. You should create a retry mechanism with exponential backoff
to reconnect your application to the nodes after maintenance occurs.
For users who have opted for manual maintenance ,
you control the update timing for the individual nodes of your cluster.
Maintenance settings
Memorystore offers you the ability to configure maintenance to
occur at the most opportune time for your application. You can do this by
configuring a maintenance window.
Maintenance windows are set per Memorystore instance and allow the
following configuration options:
Day of the week. Designates the day when maintenance occurs.
Start hour. The hour that maintenance begins.
Duration. The length of the maintenance window, ranging from 3 hours to 8
hours.
If a maintenance window is configured for an instance, future automatic
maintenance is scheduled to respect these preferences. If a maintenance window
is not specified for your instance, maintenance can begin at any time without
advanced notification.
Maintenance example
Assume you are a developer at a retailer managing a shopping cart service. You
have one Memorystore for Memcached instance for a production environment. You
want maintenance to occur at the time when your instance handles the lowest
amount of traffic, which is around midnight on Sundays.
In this case, you set your production instance's maintenance window to:
Day of the week. Sunday.
Start hour. 1 AM.
Duration. 3 hours.
In this case, we've opted for the shortest allowed duration, which ensures that
maintenance takes place during this period of low traffic. For an application
that has steady 24/7 traffic, specifying a longer duration may be preferred, as
this more evenly spreads the impact of cache flushes. For applications which are
particularly sensitive to any service impact, we recommend performing
maintenance manually .
Upcoming maintenance notifications
You can have a notification about upcoming maintenance sent to your email at
least one week before maintenance is scheduled. If you want to set an email
filter for notifications, the email title is "Upcoming maintenance for your
Cloud Memorystore instance [your-instance-name]" .
Maintenance notifications are not sent out by default. If you want to get a
notification for an upcoming maintenance you must do both of the following:
Set a maintenance window .
Opt in to maintenance notifications .
Notifications are sent to the email address associated with your Google account.
It is not possible to configure a custom email alias (for instance, a team email
alias), nor is it possible to subscribe another email address other than your
own.
When subscribing you opt into maintenance notifications for all
Memorystore instances that have maintenance windows in a given
project. You receive one notification per instance.
For instructions on finding scheduled maintenance, see Find scheduled maintenance .
Rescheduling maintenance
If you have a maintenance window for your instance, you can reschedule
maintenance at any time before maintenance is currently scheduled. For example,
if you have a new service launching during your currently scheduled maintenance
time, you might want to reschedule the maintenance window to a few days after
your launch.
You may reschedule maintenance multiple times so long as it's not more than one
week after the originally scheduled time. You have a few scheduling options for
the new maintenance window:
Update now. You can apply the update to your instance immediately instead of waiting
for the scheduled maintenance window.
Defer to next scheduled window. This defers maintenance by one week.
Custom day and time. This lets you choose any specific time within one
week after the originally scheduled maintenance time.
Rescheduling maintenance has the following additional behavior:
You cannot reschedule maintenance if less than an hour remains before
currently scheduled maintenance.
You cannot reschedule for multiple Memcached instances with a single
operation. They must be rescheduled individually.
For instructions on rescheduling maintenance see Reschedule planned maintenance .
Caution: Although Memorystore does not provide the option to
reschedule maintenance for multiple instances at once, some
Memorystore users with large instance counts opt to
programmatically reschedule in bulk.
If you are rescheduling in bulk, it is important to batch your operations into
appropriate sized requests. We recommend limiting the batch size to
100 instances and waiting ample time between requests. Exceeding
this limit can result in failed rescheduling events.
Best practices
Set a maintenance window and subscribe to notifications for all production
instances.
Choose an appropriate duration. Nodes are updated sequentially over the course
of your entire specified duration. Choosing a longer duration spreads node
cache flushes over a longer period of time which yields less impact to your
application. However, a shorter duration allows the update to complete more
quickly which may be desirable for applications that have well known low
traffic periods or applications that are sensitive to any level of cache
disruption.
Take measures so that the System Memory Utilization
metric is at 50% or lower at the time of the scheduled maintenance. You can do
this by scheduling for a time when instance traffic is low, or by temporarily
scaling up your instance size during the maintenance window so that the
System Memory Utilization metric is at 50% or lower.
Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff
to reconnect your application to the instance after maintenance.
Leverage the reschedule features to test the update on a non-production
instance once the update becomes available
Manual maintenance
While we expect that automatic maintenance via maintenance windows meets the
requirements for the majority of Memorystore users, manual
maintenance provides a gcloud interface for updating an instance. By using this
interface, you can individually update your cluster nodes at a rate and time
that makes the most sense for your application. As each node is updated by
calling the gcloud interface, the individual node cache is flushed and
connections are dropped similar to automatic maintenance .
To perform manual maintenance you must first set a maintenance window for your
instance and subscribe for maintenance notifications. Once an update is
available you receive an email notification with the scheduled maintenance time
for your instance. At this point, you can begin to manually apply updates to your instance .
If the Memorystore for Memcached cluster is not fully updated by the scheduled
maintenance time, any remaining cluster nodes are updated automatically
during the maintenance window. If you have fully updated your instance prior to
the scheduled maintenance time, there is no impact to the instance during
the defined maintenance window.
FAQ
The following are some frequently asked questions about the maintenance policy
for Memorystore for Memcached:
What is the impact of maintenance on Memcached instances?
During maintenance the nodes in your cluster are updated sequentially over the
duration of your maintenance window. Each node undergoes a cache flush with a
downtime of approximately 5 minutes per node. For more details on impact, see
Impact of maintenance .
What is the duration of a maintenance update?
The window duration is user configurable from 3 to 8 hours. Node updates are
spaced evenly across the designated duration.
How do I know when maintenance is scheduled for my instance?
We recommend subscribing for notifications to learn when maintenance is
scheduled for your instance. You can also check manually in the Cloud console.
If the Cloud console is blank and you have already set a maintenance window,
you do not have upcoming maintenance scheduled yet.
When am I notified of upcoming maintenance?
If you are subscribed for maintenance notifications and have set a maintenance
window, you are alerted by email at least seven days before a maintenance event.
How long can I defer maintenance?
Once maintenance has been scheduled for your instance, you may start the update
for your instance immediately or defer the update for up to seven days from the
originally scheduled maintenance time. For example, if maintenance is scheduled
for Oct. 11 at 11:15 PM, you can defer until Oct. 18 at 11:15 PM. Maintenance
is applied at the scheduled time if no action is taken.
For more details, see Reschedule planned maintenance .
Is the IP address of my instance change during maintenance?
No. The IP address of your Memcached instance does not change.
Does setting or adjusting a maintenance window impact my instance?
No. Setting or adjusting the maintenance window does not cause any downtime for
your instance. Also, it does not change the IP address of the instance, or
cause any other changes to your instance.
What best practices should I follow for a smooth maintenance update experience?
We recommend that you follow the guidance in the best practices section
for maintenance updates.
When should I apply maintenance immediately?
One circumstance when you should apply maintenance immediately is on a test
instance to see how it affects a production instance. You can
reschedule planned maintenance
to have it apply immediately on a test instance. This allows you to observe the
impact it has, and defer maintenance on production instances as needed/allowed.
Do maintenance updates always complete inside the maintenance window?
Updates start inside of the maintenance window you specify. The update almost
always completes within the window.
Can I opt out of maintenance or schedule maintenance on certain instances first?
No, you can neither opt out of maintenance nor control the initial scheduling of
maintenance. However, you can reschedule maintenance
to defer it for up to seven days.
Can an update ever be applied outside a maintenance window?
In very rare circumstances, in order to protect against vulnerabilities that are
time sensitive, maintenance can be applied to a Memcached instance
outside of your designated maintenance window.
What happens if Memorystore cancels maintenance?
If Memorystore cancels a maintenance event you receive a
notification that maintenance is cancelled. In rare cases, it might not be
possible for Memorystore to send a cancellation notification in
advance. In this case, you are notified that maintenance was not applied after
the scheduled maintenance window has passed.
The maintenance is then rescheduled for a future maintenance window based on
your selected preferences. You receive a new notification of upcoming
maintenance when the maintenance event is rescheduled.
What time format is used for maintenance windows?
When using the Google Cloud console, maintenance windows are displayed and
set in your local time zone but stored in UTC time; the Google Cloud console
also displays the maintenance window time relative to UTC time. When setting
windows with the Google Cloud CLI, you set the time using UTC time.
You should schedule windows based off UTC time because the Google Cloud console
shows the window in the viewer's local time zone. This can cause confusion
if users are setting the window in different time zones.
Maintenance windows do not undergo daylight savings time changes.
