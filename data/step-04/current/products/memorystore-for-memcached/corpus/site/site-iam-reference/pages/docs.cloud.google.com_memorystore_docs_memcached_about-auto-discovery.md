Memorystore for Memcached is being deprecated and will be shut down on January 31, 2029. After February 1, 2027, you can't create Memorystore for Memcached instances in new projects unless these instances already exist in these projects. We recommend that you migrate your workloads to Memorystore for Valkey , which offers superior performance and features.

About the Auto Discovery service

This page provides an overview of the Auto Discovery service for
Memorystore for Memcached. To learn how to access and connect to the Auto Discovery
service, see Using the Auto Discovery Service .
The Auto Discovery service is a programmatic way for clients to automatically
adapt to the addition and removal of node IP addresses that happens when you
scale your Memcached instance.
If you don't use the Auto Discovery service, you must manually manage the node
IP address list in your memcached client during scaling. Manually managing the
node IP address list adds additional overhead because you must ensure that the
clients are updated as the instance scales up and down. The Auto Discovery helps
to automate this work for you.
You should use the Auto Discovery endpoint for its intended purpose, and not
to run Memcached commands such as get , set , and delete .
Overview of Auto Discovery service architecture
Memorystore for Memcached exposes the Auto Discovery service using a discovery
endpoint . The discovery endpoint is a dedicated IP address for your instance
that returns a current list of nodes in your Memcached instance. Every
Memorystore for Memcached instance has a unique discovery endpoint. Once the
instance is created, the IP address of the discovery endpoint does not change.
To get the instance's Auto Discovery information, you query the discovery
endpoint. The discovery endpoint returns the following information:
Field
Description
Datatype
Example
Configuration version ID
ID that increments for each node list change
Integer
9
Node List
Returns a list of current nodes and their IP addresses.
String
node1-ip|node1-ip|node1-port node2-ip|node2-ip|node2-port
Memorystore for Memcached directly exposes the discovery endpoint, however auto
discovery must also be available in your client libraries. There are two ways to
have auto discovery in your clients:
Use a client library that supports auto discovery.
Golang
memcached client fork.
Manually add auto discovery logic to your client library.
Auto Discovery service behavior
The Auto Discovery service is eventually consistent. There can be a delay (on
the order of seconds) while the Auto Discovery node list catches up to the
current cluster configuration after a scaling operation.
Eventual consistency, in addition to the distributed nature of the service,
can produce the following behavior for clients. The client logic should be
designed to account for this behavior:
Same client on two separate queries to the Auto Discovery service can receive
two different Auto Discovery responses from the service (while the service is
inconsistent). However, one of the responses has a higher Configuration
version ID which clients can use to handle the responses.
Two clients can receive two different Auto Discovery responses from the
service (while the service is inconsistent), but they don't have a way to find
which one is latest as clients don't talk to each other. While in this state,
the instance can return cache misses. In this scenario, clients have to wait
for the Auto Discovery service to become consistent.
