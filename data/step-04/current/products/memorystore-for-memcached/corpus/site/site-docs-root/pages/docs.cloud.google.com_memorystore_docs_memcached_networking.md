Memorystore for Memcached is being deprecated and will be shut down on January 31, 2029. After February 1, 2027, you can't create Memorystore for Memcached instances in new projects unless these instances already exist in these projects. We recommend that you migrate your workloads to Memorystore for Valkey , which offers superior performance and features.

This page gives an overview of networking for Memorystore for Memcached. For a list of
common networking errors, see Networking error scenarios .
Private services access
Memorystore for Memcached uses private services access
to create a network peering between your project and an internal network for
some Google Cloud services like Cloud SQL, Memorystore for Redis,
and Memorystore for Memcached.
This means that you must first establish a private services access connection
for a network before you can create a Memcached instance using that network.
Using a private services access connection offers you the benefit of
centralized, customizable IP address ranges for the aforementioned services. For
instructions on selecting a specific IP range allocation, see Creating a Memcached instance that uses a specific IP address range .
Important: Once a private services connection is established for any of these
services on a network, it is established for all other services on that network
that use the private services access networking architecture.
On-premises access with private services access
You can connect from a client in an on-premises network if the on-premises
network is connected to the VPC network to which your
Memorystore for Memcached instance is connected. To permit connections from an
on-premises network, do the following:
Ensure your Shared VPC network is connected to your on-premises
network using a one of the following options
Cloud VPN tunnel
an interconnect attachment (VLAN) for
Dedicated Interconnect or
Partner Interconnect .
Identify the peering produced by the private services connection.
The peering used by Memorystore for Memcached is named
servicenetworking-googleapis-com .
Update the peering connection to exchange custom routes by setting both
--import-custom-routes and --export-custom-routes
flag
Identify the allocated range used by the private services connection.
Create a Cloud Router custom advertised route for the allocated
range on the Cloud Routers managing BGP sessions for your
Cloud VPN tunnels or Cloud Interconnect attachments (VLANs).
Communicating networking requirements
Usually the networking team and/or network admin for your organization is
responsible for setting up a private services access connection. This allows the
networking team to ensure that no IP addresses or ranges used for other
Google Cloud resources overlap, which can cause connectivity issues.
We recommend that you contact the network\security team in your organization to
set up the private service connection for you, especially if you encounter an
error during the setup process. When reaching out to your networking team, send
them the following information:
The Memorystore for Memcached instance cannot be created due to the following
error:
"Google private services access is not enabled. Enable privates service access
and try again."
Before an instance can be created, a private service access connection needs to
be established for network <project name: network>. Please refer to the
following Memorystore documentation links for more information on how to create
this connection:
* Networking .
* Establishing a private services access connection .
* Verifying a private services access connection .
IP addresses
Each Memorystore for Memcached instance has a discovery endpoint ,
and each node in the instance has its own IP address. You can view these IP
addresses in the Google Cloud console, or by using gcloud memcache instances describe .
IP addresses for nodes and for the discovery endpoint do not change.
Supported networks and client IP ranges
The following network or instances with RFC 1918 IP addresses are supported:
VPC networks except legacy networks
Shared VPC networks
on-premise systems
Compute Engine VM instances except for 172.17.0.0/16 because this IP range is reserved for internal components
We recommend using a private services access range with a block size of at
least /24 to support Memorystore for Memcached and other services. However, the
minimum block size needed to support Memorystore for Memcached is /26 .
What's next
Establish a private services access connection .
Create a Memcached instance .
