Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
We recommend that you migrate your Memorystore for Memcached workloads to
Memorystore for Valkey . Memorystore for Memcached is
a key-value datastore, but Memorystore for Valkey is a more feature-rich data
structure server.
Memorystore for Valkey provides you with similar functionality to
Memorystore for Memcached. In addition, Memorystore for Valkey has the
following benefits:
It offers a fully managed, high-performance, in-memory datastore for Valkey, a
Redis-compatible, open-source project.
It's a fully managed Valkey service for Google Cloud, which supports
both Cluster Mode Enabled and Cluster Mode Disabled instances.
Your applications that run on Google Cloud can achieve extreme
performance by leveraging the highly scalable, available, secure Valkey service
without the burden of managing complex Valkey deployments.
Memorystore for Valkey features
Migrating to Memorystore for Valkey provides you with access to features
that aren't available in Memorystore for Memcached. These features provide you with
better application development, reliability, and performance.
The following table lists and describes features that are available in
Memorystore for Valkey, and explains the advantages of using these
features.
Feature
Description
Advantages
Multiple databases
Memorystore for Memcached is a single, flat keyspace. However, by default,
the Cluster
Mode Disabled mode of Memorystore for Valkey supports up to 16
databases for an instance. You can configure your environment so that you
can have up to 100 databases for an instance.
Having multiple databases for an instance prevents a single point of
failure for the instance, lets you backup or restore a single database
without impacting the availability or consistency of other databases, and
lets you scale or migrate your databases more efficiently.
Rich data structures
In addition to strings, Memorystore for Valkey supports lists,
sets, sorted sets, hashes, and bitmaps. Memorystore for Valkey also
supports Bloom
filters , vector
search , and JSON .
You can use Memorystore for Valkey for complex use cases such as
leaderboards, task queues, and object caching, without application
serialization. You can also use vector search to perform semantic queries at
sub-millisecond latencies.
Transactions
You can use the MULTI
and EXEC
commands to run a group of commands as a single, indivisible unit
atomically.
Although you can use the compare-and-swap (CAS) capabilities of
Memorystore for Memcached for optimistic locking on a key level,
Memorystore for Valkey lets you run a group of commands atomically.
Pub/Sub messaging
By using Pub/Sub with
Memorystore for Valkey, your client applications can subscribe to
channels and receive real-time messages.
Memorystore for Valkey lets you transform your cache into a
lightweight message broker for real-time updates and inter-service
communication.
Lua scripts
You can use Lua to
run complex application logic atomically on your server by using the
EVAL command.
Using server-side scripts reduces your network round trips and ensures
that Memorystore for Valkey can perform complex operations without
interruptions. This boosts your application's performance.
High-availability, replication, and shard support
Memorystore for Valkey's architecture supports and provides
high availability (HA) .
Your client applications can access Memorystore for Valkey nodes
directly by connecting to individual endpoints (or shards).
HA and replication enhance your system's reliability and minimize
interruptions during critical updates. Using shards helps you distribute the
high load of traffic associated with your client applications effectively.
Persistence
Memorystore for Valkey supports the following types of
persistence :
Append-only file (AOF) : used for data durability. It stores
data durably by recording every write command to a log file called the
AOF file. If a system failure or restart occurs, then the server replays
AOF file commands sequentially to restore your data.
Redis database (RDB) : used for data protection. It protects
your data by saving snapshots of your data on durable storage. If node
failures occur, then you can recover your data.
By using AOF and RDB persistence, you can store your critical data in
Memorystore for Valkey durably. You can recover your data at any
time. Memorystore for Valkey handles the underlying persistence
mechanism so there's little ramp-up to using persistence.

FAQ
This section contains frequently asked questions (FAQs) about migrating your
Memorystore for Memcached workloads to Memorystore for Valkey.
Why are you migrating to Memorystore for Valkey?
Valkey is a high-performance, open-source project fork of the Redis codebase.
Memorystore for Valkey provides a managed service that's compatible with
the Redis protocol. This ensures that all existing Redis client libraries and
commands work seamlessly. Migrating to Memorystore for Valkey is
functionally equivalent to migrating to a standard, Redis-compatible server.
Do you have to reconfigure your network firewall rules?
Memorystore for Memcached instances typically use port 11211 whereas
Memorystore for Valkey instances use port 6379 . You must ensure that
your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) firewall rules allow egress traffic from your
applications to the Memorystore for Valkey instances on the correct
port.
Note: If you created a Cluster Mode Enabled instance when you deployed and verified the migration , then your instance requires additional ports. For more information, see Which ports do you need to set up networking in Memorystore for Valkey? .
How does Valkey handle the serialization of complex objects?
Because Memcached doesn't know the structure of complex objects, such as Python
objects or Java objects, it treats all objects as opaque blobs.
As a result, before any data hits the network, serialization happens entirely on
the side of the client applications. The server sees only byte arrays. For
example, to read a single property such as a user's email address, you must
retrieve the entire serialized object, deserialize it in your applications, and
then read the field associated with the property.
Valkey can store blobs and understand the structure of the complex objects. You
can also use Valkey to expand an object's fields into a Valkey hash table. You
can use this table to retrieve deep-nested values directly.
The following example uses a Valkey hash table to retrieve a user's email
address:
# valkey-py
client.hset("user:101", mapping={
"name": "username",
"email": "username@example.com",
"login_count": 10
})
client.hget("user:101", "email") # -> b"username@example.com"
How do communication protocols differ between Memcached and Valkey?
Memcached uses an ASCII protocol and an optional binary protocol. Valkey uses
the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).
Although these are different protocols, modern Valkey client application
libraries handle the RESP protocol automatically. This makes the difference
between the protocols transparent to the application code.
After you migrate to Memorystore for Valkey, how do you map the flags field?
Memorystore for Memcached supports the flags field. This field contains a
32-bit unsigned integer that client application libraries use to store metadata
about stored values.
Memorystore for Valkey doesn't support this field. To map the flags
field to Memorystore for Valkey, complete the following steps:
Serialize the flags into the key name of a string object.
Serialize the flags into the value of a string object.
Use a hash object with a designated field for flags.
Does Memorystore for Valkey offer better performance?
In most scenarios, performance is better in Memorystore for Valkey. This
is due to Valkey's advanced data structures, persistent connections, pipelining
support, and improved efficiency for multi-key operations. However, you must
modify your client libraries and commands
correctly.
Note: For more information about configuring Memorystore for Valkey for
optimal performance, see Best practices for Memorystore for Valkey .
If your Memorystore for Memcached instances use multiple nodes, then what do you do in Memorystore for Valkey?
When you deploy and verify your migration , create
Cluster Mode Enabled instances in Memorystore for Valkey. These
instances handle sharding and high availability internally, and appear as single
endpoints to your applications. This simplifies the client-side logic of your
applications.
If your Memorystore for Memcached instances use multiple nodes, then which node type do we recommend for your Memorystore for Valkey instances?
For each of your Memorystore for Memcached instances, to determine its node size,
check the value that's associated with the Memory per node property. Then, to determine the node type for your
corresponding Memorystore for Valkey instances, use the following table:
Memorystore for Memcached node size
Memorystore for Valkey node type
Total node capacity
vCPU count
shared-core-nano
1.4 GB
0.5 (Shared)
1 GB – 5 GB
standard-small
6.5 GB
2
6 GB – 12 GB
highmem-medium
13.0 GB
2
13 GB – 50 GB
highmem-xlarge
58.0 GB
8
The shared-core-nano node type is for small workloads. This node type provides
variable performance and
doesn't have an SLA, making it unsuitable for production workloads.
The more virtual CPUs (vCPUs) that you select for your
Memorystore for Valkey instance, the better the performance. If your
instance runs resource-intensive workloads, then select a node type with a
higher vCPU (for example, highmem-xlarge ). If your instance performs
less-demanding tasks, then select a node type with a lower vCPU (for example,
highmem-medium ).
Note: For more information about the Memorystore for Valkey node types,
see Instance and node specification .
