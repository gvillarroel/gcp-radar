Use FSDP to fine-tune Llama 4 on an A4 Slurm cluster
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial shows you how to fine-tune a Llama-4-Scout-17 large language
model (LLM) on a multi-node, multi-GPU Slurm cluster on Google Cloud. The cluster
uses two A4 virtual machine (VM) instances which each have 8 NVIDIA B200 GPUs.
The two main processes described in this tutorial are as follows:
Deploy a production-grade, high-performance Slurm cluster by using the
Google Cloud Cluster Toolkit. As part of this deployment,
you create a custom VM image with the necessary software pre-installed.
You also set up a shared Filestore instance, and configure
high-speed RDMA networking.
After the cluster is deployed, you run a distributed fine-tuning job by
using the set of scripts that accompany this tutorial. The job leverages
PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), which you access through the
the Hugging Face
Transformer Reinforcement Learning
Important: To complete this tutorial, you must have reserved the capacity to
create two A4 VMs. To
learn more about your options for reserving capacity in
AI Hypercomputer for a future date and time, see
Choose a consumption option .
This tutorial is intended for machine learning (ML) engineers, platform
administrators and operators, and for data and AI specialists who are interested
in using Slurm job scheduling capabilities to handle fine-tuning workloads.

Prepare your environment
To prepare your environment, follow these steps:
Clone the Cluster Toolkit GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cluster-toolkit.git
Create a Cloud Storage bucket:
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
BUCKET_NAME : a name for your
Cloud Storage bucket that follows
bucket naming requirements .
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the
Google Cloud project where you want to create your
Cloud Storage bucket.
Create an A4 Slurm cluster
To create an A4 Slurm cluster, follow these steps:
Go to the cluster-toolkit directory:
cd cluster-toolkit
If it's your first time using Cluster Toolkit, then build the
gcluster binary:
make
Go to the examples/machine-learning/a4-highgpu-8g directory:
cd examples/machine-learning/a4-highgpu-8g/
Open the a4high-slurm-deployment.yaml file, and then edit it as follows:
terraform_backend_defaults :
type : gcs
configuration :
bucket : BUCKET_NAME
vars :
deployment_name : a4-high
project_id : PROJECT_ID
region : REGION
zone : ZONE
a4h_cluster_size : 2
a4h_reservation_name : RESERVATION_URL
Replace the following:
BUCKET_NAME : the name of the
Cloud Storage bucket that you created in the previous section.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the
Google Cloud project where your Cloud Storage exists and
where you want to create your Slurm cluster.
REGION : the region where your
reservation exists.
ZONE : the zone where your reservation
exists.
RESERVATION_URL : the URL of
the reservation that you want to use to create your Slurm cluster. Based
on the project in which the reservation exists, specify one of the
following values:
The reservation exists in your project:
RESERVATION_NAME
The reservation exists in a different project, and your project can
use the reservation:
projects/ RESERVATION_PROJECT_ID /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME
Deploy the cluster:
./gcluster deploy -d examples/machine-learning/a4-highgpu-8g/a4high-slurm-deployment.yaml examples/machine-learning/a4-highgpu-8g/a4high-slurm-blueprint.yaml --auto-approve
The ./gcluster deploy command is a two-phase process, which is as follows:
The first phase builds a custom image with all software pre-installed,
which can take up to 35 minutes to complete.
The second phase deploys the cluster by using that custom image. This
process should complete more quickly than the first phase.
If the first phase succeeds but the second phase fails, then you can try to
deploy the Slurm cluster again by skipping the first phase:
./gcluster deploy -d examples/machine-learning/a4-highgpu-8g/a4high-slurm-deployment.yaml examples/machine-learning/a4-highgpu-8g/a4high-slurm-blueprint.yaml --auto-approve --skip "image" -w
Prepare your workload
To prepare your workload, you do the following:
Create workload scripts .
Upload scripts to the Slurm cluster .
Connect to the Slurm cluster .
Install frameworks and tools .
Create workload scripts
To create the scripts that your fine-tuning workload will use, follow these
steps:
To set up the Python virtual environment, create the
install_environment.sh file with the following content:
#!/bin/bash
# This script sets up a consistent environment for FSDP training.
# It is meant to be run once on the login node of your Slurm cluster
set -e

Upload scripts to the Slurm cluster
To upload the scripts that you created in the previous section to the Slurm
cluster, follow these steps:
To identify your login node, list all A4 VMs in your project:
gcloud compute instances list --filter = "machineType:a4-highgpu-8g"
The name of the login node is similar to a4-high-login-001 .
Upload your scripts to the login node's home directory:
gcloud compute scp --project = " $PROJECT_ID " --zone = " $ZONE " --tunnel-through-iap \
./install_environment.sh \
./requirements-fsdp.txt \
./llama4-train-distributed.py \
./submit.slurm \
" ${ LOGIN_NODE_NAME } " :~/
Replace LOGIN_NODE_NAME with the
name of the login node.
Connect to the Slurm cluster
Connect to the Slurm cluster by connecting to the login node through SSH:
gcloud compute ssh LOGIN_NODE_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--tunnel-through-iap \
--zone = ZONE
Install frameworks and tools
After you connect to the login node, install frameworks and tools by doing the
following:
Export your Hugging Face token:
# On the login node
export HF_TOKEN = "hf_..." # Replace with your token
Run the installation script:
# On the login node
chmod +x install_environment.sh
./install_environment.sh
This command sets up a virtual environment with all the required
dependencies, and downloads the model weights into the ~/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct
file.
Because the model download is very large (~200 GB), this process takes around
30 minutes, depending on network conditions.
Start your fine-tuning workload
To start training your workload, do the following:
Submit the job to the Slurm scheduler:
sbatch submit.slurm
On the login node in your Slurm cluster, you can monitor the job's progress
by checking the output files created in your home directory:
# On the login node
tail -f llama4-*.out
If your job successfully starts, then the .err file shows a progress bar
that updates as your job progresses.
This job should take a bit over an hour to complete on the Slurm Cluster. The
job has two main phases:
Copying the large base model to the local SSD of each compute node.
The training job, which begins once the copying of the model is complete.
This job takes about 35 minutes to run.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete your project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
