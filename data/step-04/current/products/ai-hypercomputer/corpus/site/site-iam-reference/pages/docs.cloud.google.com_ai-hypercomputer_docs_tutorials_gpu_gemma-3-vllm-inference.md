Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the required API:
Roles required to enable APIs

Sign in to Hugging Face
Create a Hugging Face read access token .
Click Your Profile > Settings > Access tokens > +Create new token
Copy and save the read access token value. You use it later in
this tutorial.
Prepare your environment
To prepare your environment, set the default environment variables:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set billing/quota_project PROJECT_ID
export PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get project )
export RESERVATION_URL = RESERVATION_URL
export REGION = REGION
export CLUSTER_NAME = CLUSTER_NAME
export HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN = HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN
export NETWORK = NETWORK_NAME
export SUBNETWORK = SUBNETWORK_NAME
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project
where you want to create the GKE cluster.
RESERVATION_URL : the URL of the reservation that you want
to use to create your GKE cluster. Based on the project in
which the reservation exists, specify one of the following values:
The reservation exists in your project:
RESERVATION_NAME
The reservation exists in a different project, and your project can
use the reservation:
projects/ RESERVATION_PROJECT_ID /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME
REGION : the region where you want to create your
GKE cluster. You can only create the cluster in the region
where you reservation exists.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the GKE cluster
to create.
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN : the Hugging Face access token that
you created in the previous section.
NETWORK_NAME : the network that the GKE
cluster uses. Specify one of the following values:
If you created a custom network, then specify the name of your network.
Otherwise, specify default .
SUBNETWORK_NAME : the subnetwork that the
GKE cluster uses. Specify one of the following values:
If you created a custom subnetwork, then specify the name of your
subnetwork. You can only specify a subnetwork that exists in the same
region as the reservation.
Otherwise, specify default .
Create a GKE cluster in Autopilot mode
To create a GKE cluster in Autopilot mode, run the
following command:
gcloud container clusters create-auto $CLUSTER_NAME \
--project = $PROJECT_ID \
--region = $REGION \
--release-channel = rapid \
--network = $NETWORK \
--subnetwork = $SUBNETWORK
Creating the GKE cluster might take some time to complete. To
verify that Google Cloud has finished creating your cluster, go to
Kubernetes clusters
on the Google Cloud console.
Create a Kubernetes secret for Hugging Face credentials
To create a Kubernetes secret for Hugging Face credentials, follow these steps:
Configure kubectl to communicate with your GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $REGION
Create a Kubernetes secret to store your Hugging Face token:
kubectl create secret generic hf-secret \
--from-literal = hf_api_token = ${ HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN } \
--dry-run = client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
Deploy a vLLM container to your GKE cluster
To deploy the vLLM container to serve the Gemma 3 27B model by using Kubernetes
Deployments, follow these steps:
Create a vllm-3-27b-it.yaml file with your chosen vLLM deployment:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :

Apply the vllm-3-27b-it.yaml file to your GKE cluster:
kubectl apply -f vllm-3-27b-it.yaml
During the deployment process, the container must download Gemma 3 from
Hugging Face. For this reason, deployment of the container might take up to
30 minutes to complete.
Wait for the deployment to complete:
kubectl wait \
--for=condition=Available \
--timeout=1800s deployment/vllm-gemma-deployment
Interact with Gemma 3 by using curl
To verify your deployed Gemma 3 27B instruction-tuned models, follow these
steps:
Set up port forwarding to Gemma 3:
kubectl port-forward service/llm-service 8000:8000
Open a new terminal window. You can then chat with your model by using
curl :
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"model": "google/gemma-3-27b-it",
"messages": [
{
"role": "user",
"content": "Why is the sky blue?"
}
]
}'
The output is similar to the following:
{
"id" : "chatcmpl-e4a2e624bea849d9b09f838a571c4d9e" ,
"object" : "chat.completion" ,
"created" : 1741763029 ,
"model" : "google/gemma-3-27b-it" ,
"choices" : [
{
"index" : 0 ,
"message" : {
"role" : "assistant" ,
"reasoning_content" : null ,
"content" : "Okay, let's break down why the sky appears blue! It's a fascinating phenomenon rooted in physics, specifically something called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's the explanation: ..." ,
"tool_calls" : []
},
"logprobs" : null ,
"finish_reason" : "stop" ,
"stop_reason" : 106
}
],
"usage" : {
"prompt_tokens" : 15 ,
"total_tokens" : 668 ,
"completion_tokens" : 653 ,
"prompt_tokens_details" : null
},
"prompt_logprobs" : null
}
If you want to observe your model's performance, then you can use the vLLM
dashboard integration in Cloud Monitoring. This dashboard helps you view
critical performance metrics for your model like token throughput, network
latency, and error rates. For information, see
vLLM in the
Monitoring documentation.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete your project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete your GKE cluster
To delete your GKE cluster, run the following command:
gcloud container clusters delete $CLUSTER_NAME \
--region = $REGION
Delete the yaml file and Kubernetes secret
To delete the vllm-3-27b-it.yaml file and the Kubernetes secret from the
GKE cluster, run the following commands:
kubectl delete -f vllm-3-27b-it.yaml
kubectl delete secret hf-secret
