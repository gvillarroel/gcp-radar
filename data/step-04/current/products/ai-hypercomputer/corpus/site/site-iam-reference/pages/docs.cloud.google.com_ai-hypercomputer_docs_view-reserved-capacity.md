This document explains how to view your requests for reserved capacity and
your reserved capacity for AI Hypercomputer. By viewing the
availability, properties, and topology of your reserved capacity and requests,
you can plan reserved capacity for your workloads.
The scope of this document is limited to workloads that use a capacity option
that mentions future reservations . For more information about the
capacity options for AI Hypercomputer, see
Capacity overview .
After Google Cloud approves a future reservation request, Compute Engine
automatically creates ( auto-creates ) an empty reservation for your
requested resources. You can then view the reservation to plan your workload.
Later, at the requested start time, the following occurs:
Compute Engine adds your reserved Compute Engine instances to the reservation.
You can then start using the reservation by creating compute instances that match the
reservation.
You can modify the reservation to allow Vertex AI training or prediction jobs to use
it. For instructions, see
Modify the sharing policy of a reservation .
Limitations
You can view a shared reservation or shared future reservation request only in the project where
Google created it.
Before you begin
Reserve capacity: If your project hasn't already, reserve capacity for
AI Hypercomputer by using one of the following options:
Reserve capacity through your account team
Create a future reservation request in calendar mode
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console gcloud REST
More
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
In one of the following development environments, set up the gcloud CLI:
Cloud Shell : to use an online terminal with the gcloud CLI
already set up, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell on this page
At the bottom of this page, a Cloud Shell session starts and displays a
command-line prompt. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Local shell : to use a local development environment,
install and
initialize the gcloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the
credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using REST
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to view reservations,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Compute Future Reservation User ( roles/compute.futureReservationUser )
IAM role on the project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to view reservations. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to view reservations:
To view the details of a future reservation request:
compute.futureReservations.get
on the project
To view the details of a reservation:
compute.reservations.get
on the project
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
View your requests for reserved capacity
To view your future reservation requests, use one or more of the following methods:
To get an overview of all future reservation requests in your project,
view a list of your future reservation requests .
To view the full details of a single future reservation request,
view the details of a future reservation request .
View a list of your future reservation requests
You can view a list of your future reservation requests to see the reservation period, status,
and zone of your requests.
To view a list of your future reservation requests, select one of the following options:
Console gcloud REST
More
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Reservations page.
Go to Reservations
Click the Future reservations tab. The table lists each future reservation request, and
each table column describes a property.
Optional: To refine your list of requests, in the
filter_list Filter field, select the properties that you
want to filter the requests by.
To view a list of your future reservation requests, use the
gcloud compute future-reservations list command :
gcloud compute future-reservations list
The output is similar to the following example:
NAME: fr-01
TOTAL_COUNT: 100
START_TIME: 2026-07-20T07:00:00Z
END_TIME: 2026-08-05T07:00:00Z

END_TIME: 2026-12-01T00:00:00Z
PROCUREMENT_STATUS: PENDING_APPROVAL
ZONE: us-west4-b
If you want to refine your list of future reservation requests, then use the same command with
the
--filter
flag .
To view a list of your future reservation requests, make a GET request to one of the
following methods:
To view a list of requests across all zones:
futureReservations.aggregatedList method
To view a list of requests in a specific zone:
futureReservations.list method
For example, to view a list of requests across all zones, make a GET request as
follows:
GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /aggregated/futureReservations
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project where the requests
exist.
The output for a list of future reservations requests in a single zone is similar to the

compute instances that are already deployed in
the reservation.

View the topology of a reservation
You can view the detailed topology information of a reservation to
help you decide where to create compute instances
within the reserved blocks and sub-blocks. For information about the placement of reserved
compute instances that are already deployed, see
View topology of a compute instance .
If you want to view other details about a reservation, see view the details of a reservation instead.
View reserved blocks
To list and describe the available blocks in a reservation, use any of the following methods.
This task helps you determine the following:
Which blocks of capacity are in the reservation.
How much capacity is available in each block.
The health of each block, including its number of healthy sub-blocks.
(Only available by using gcloud CLI or REST.)
The name, block, and sub-block of all the
compute instances that are deployed in the
block. (Only available when viewing a specific block by using gcloud CLI or
REST.)
Console gcloud REST
More
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Reservations page.
Go to Reservations
In the On-demand reservations table, in the Name column, click the name of the
reservation that you want to view the details of. The details page of the reservation opens.
In the Resource topology section, you can view information about your reserved blocks.
This information includes the following for each block:
Block ID : the name of the block.
Count : the total number of
compute instances that can be deployed in
the block.
In use : the number of
compute instances that are already deployed
in the block.
You can view the blocks in a reservation using the following commands:
To view all the available blocks in a reservation, use the
gcloud compute reservations blocks list command :
gcloud compute reservations blocks list RESERVATION_NAME \
--zone= ZONE
To view a specific block in a reservation, use the
gcloud compute reservations blocks describe command .
To also view the name and topology of all the
compute instances that are deployed in the
block, add the --full-view=BLOCK_VIEW_FULL flag.
gcloud compute reservations blocks describe RESERVATION_NAME \
--zone= ZONE \
--block-name= BLOCK_NAME \
--full-view=BLOCK_VIEW_FULL
Replace the following:
RESERVATION_NAME : the name of the
reservation.
ZONE : the zone where the reservation exists.
