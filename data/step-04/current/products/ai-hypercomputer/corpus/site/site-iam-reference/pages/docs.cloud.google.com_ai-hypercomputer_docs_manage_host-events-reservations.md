What's next
This document explains how to use the host maintenance features that are
available in AI Hypercomputer. It explains how to monitor, plan for,
and perform scheduled maintenance on your reserved blocks of capacity. To manage
maintenance on your Compute Engine instances, see instead
Manage host events across compute instances .
You can proactively manage upcoming
maintenance host events on
your reserved blocks of capacity, whether instances are running on them or not. This
approach helps you minimize disruptions and maintain optimal performance.
Before you begin
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console gcloud REST
More
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
In one of the following development environments, set up the gcloud CLI:
Cloud Shell : to use an online terminal with the gcloud CLI
already set up, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell on this page
At the bottom of this page, a Cloud Shell session starts and displays a
command-line prompt. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Local shell : to use a local development environment,
install and
initialize the gcloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the
credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using REST
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to manage host maintenance events across reservations,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Compute Admin ( roles/compute.admin )
on the project
For read-only access to System Event audit logs:
Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer )
on the project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to manage host maintenance events across reservations. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to manage host maintenance events across reservations:
To start host maintenance for a reservation:
compute.reservations.performMaintenance
on the project
To start host maintenance for a reservation block:
compute.reservationBlocks.performMaintenance
on the project
To start host maintenance for a reservation sub-block:
compute.reservationSubBlocks.performMaintenance
on the project

on the project
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Overview
If you haven't already, then review
Understand and handle host maintenance .
To optimize the maintenance of your reserved blocks of capacity, complete the
following steps:
Set up notification alerts . Create log-based alerts to get notified
about scheduled, started, or completed maintenance events for a reservation,
a reservation block, or a reservation sub-block. This approach helps you
proactively plan your activities and avoid unexpected downtime.
Manage maintenance across blocks of capacity . View and, if needed,
manually start maintenance across your reservations, reservation blocks, or
reservation sub-blocks. This process helps you increase the resilience of
your workloads to host errors, prevent downtime, and ensure that your
applications remain available.
Set up notification alerts for reservations
You can get notified about scheduled, started, or completed maintenance events
for a reservation, reservation block, or reservation sub-block by
creating log-based alerting policies .
For a shared reservation, both the owner project and any project that the
reservation is shared with receive notifications.
To create an alert for the maintenance events of a reservation, a reservation
block, or a reservation sub-block, complete the following procedure. Repeat this
procedure for each alert that you want to create.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
segment
Logs Explorer page:
Go to Logs Explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Logging .
Click the Show query toggle to the on position.
In the Query pane, build one of the following queries. These queries
filter log entries to identify specific maintenance events. Repeat this
procedure for each query you want to create.
Receive maintenance alerts for a reservation :
To receive alerts when maintenance is scheduled:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.upcomingGroupMaintenance" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "scheduled"
To receive alerts when maintenance has completed:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.completedGroupMaintenance" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "completed"
Receive maintenance alerts for a reservation block :
To receive alerts when maintenance is scheduled:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.block.upcomingGroupMaintenance" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "scheduled"
To receive alerts when maintenance has started:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.block.startGroupMaintenance" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "started"
To receive alerts when maintenance has completed:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.block.completedGroupMaintenance" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "completed"
Receive maintenance alerts for a reservation sub-block of A4X Max or A4X instances :
To receive alerts when maintenance is scheduled:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.subBlock.upcomingGroupMaintenance" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "scheduled"
To receive alerts when maintenance has started:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.subBlock.startGroupMaintenance" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "started"
To receive alerts when maintenance has completed:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.subBlock.completedGroupMaintenance" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "completed"
To receive alerts when an A4X Max or A4X machine encounters an error and
Compute Engine starts maintenance:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.subblock.unusedmachinerepair" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "maintenance"
To receive alerts when maintenance for an A4X Max or A4X machine that
encountered an error has completed:
protoPayload.methodName="compute.reservations.subblock.unusedmachinerepaircomplete" severity>=DEFAULT
protoPayload.status.message =~ "repaired"
To validate the query, click Run query . If the query is valid, then the
Query results pane displays log entries that match the query.
In the Query results toolbar, click the Actions list, and then
select add_alert Create log alert .
The Create logs-based alert policy pane appears.
In the Alert details section, do the following:

severity).
Click Next .
In the Choose logs to include in the alert section, click Next .
In the Set notification frequency and autoclose duration section,
specify the following:
In the Time between notifications list, select how often you want to
be notified.
In the Incident autoclose duration list, select after how long
Cloud Logging stops sending notifications and automatically closes
the incident.
Click Next .
In the Who should be notified? section, specify a
notification channel for
Logging to send notifications to.
Click Save .
Manage maintenance across reservations
You can view and control maintenance for your reservations, reservation blocks,
and reservation sub-blocks as follows:
To check the state and scheduled time of upcoming maintenance for your
reservations, reservation blocks, or reservation sub-blocks,
view maintenance state .
To manually start maintenance on a reservation, reservation block, or
reservation sub-block, rather than waiting for the scheduled maintenance
date and time, manually start maintenance .
To manage how early you want to receive notifications when a compute instance's
host requires emergency, unplanned maintenance after a host error or faulty
host report,
manage hardware emergency maintenance notifications .
View maintenance state
You can view the upcoming maintenance state for a reservation, a reservation
block, or a reservation sub-block by checking the value of the
upcomingGroupMaintenance field in their metadata. If a reservation lacks the
upcomingGroupMaintenance field, then no maintenance is scheduled for the
reservation, reservation block, or reservation sub-block. For more information
about the fields in upcomingGroupMaintenance , see
Maintenance status definitions
in the Compute Engine documentation.
Additionally, if maintenance is scheduled for a reservation block or sub-block,
the upcomingGroupMaintenance field contains the maintenanceReasons field.
This field describes why maintenance was scheduled for your reservation block or
sub-block, as described in the following table:
Maintenance type
Maintenance reason
Compute instance state
Planned maintenance after faulty host report
FAILURE_GPU_CUSTOMER_REPORTED
Applies only to instances that are running on the host that you reported as
faulty.
Planned maintenance for regular maintenance
PLANNED_UPDATE : planned
infrastructure maintenance
PLANNED_NETWORK_UPDATE : planned
network maintenance
Applies to running, stopped, or suspended instances.
Unplanned, emergency maintenance
FAILURE_DISK : unplanned
maintenance scheduled due to an error with a disk attached to an instance.
FAILURE_GPU : unplanned maintenance
scheduled due to a GPU-related error.
FAILURE_GPU_TEMPERATURE : unplanned
maintenance scheduled due to a GPU-related error after the GPU
reached a high temperature.
FAILURE_GPU_XID : unplanned
maintenance after you received an
Xid message due to a GPU-related error.
FAILURE_INFRA : unplanned maintenance
scheduled due to an error with the infrastructure.
FAILURE_INTERFACE : unplanned
maintenance scheduled due to an error with the NIC.
FAILURE_MEMORY : unplanned
maintenance scheduled due to an error with an instance's memory.
FAILURE_NETWORK : unplanned
maintenance scheduled due to an error with the network.
FAILURE_NVLINK : unplanned
maintenance scheduled due to an error with the NVLink.
Applies only to running instances.
To view the maintenanceReasons field in a reservation block or sub-block, or
view the maintenance state of a sub-block, you must use the
gcloud CLI or REST API. Otherwise, select one of the
following options:
Console gcloud REST

In the Google Cloud console, go to the Reservations page.
Go to Reservations
In the Maintenance status column, Compute Engine displays
the maintenance state of your reservations. If you don't see this column
in the On-demand reservations table, then click
view_column
Column display options , select the Maintenance status checkbox,
and then click OK .
To view the maintenance state of a reservation block, complete the
following steps:
In the Name column, click the name of the reservation. A page
that gives the details of the reservation appears.
In the Blocks table, in the Maintenance column,
Compute Engine displays the maintenance state of the blocks
within the reservation.
To view the maintenance state of a reservation, use the
gcloud compute reservations describe command
with the --flatten flag set to
resourceStatus.reservationMaintenance :
gcloud compute reservations describe RESERVATION_NAME \
--flatten=resourceStatus.reservationMaintenance \
--zone= ZONE
Replace the following:
RESERVATION_NAME : the name of the reservation.
ZONE : the zone where the reservation exists.
The output is similar to one of the following:
If maintenance is scheduled for your reservation, then the output is
similar to the following:
---
maintenanceOngoingCount: 0
maintenancePendingCount: 6

windowStartTime: '2025-11-13T12:00:00.000-08:00'
If the schedulingType field is set to INDEPENDENT , then the
upcomingGroupMaintenance field doesn't contain the
windowStartTime and windowEndTime fields. To see when
maintenance is scheduled for an instance that runs on a reserved host,
view the maintenance state for the instance .
If maintenance isn't scheduled for your reservation, then the output
is similar to the following:
---
schedulingType: GROUPED
If maintenance is scheduled for your reservation, then, to view the
maintenance state of the blocks within the reservation, use the
gcloud compute reservations blocks list command :
gcloud compute reservations blocks list RESERVATION_NAME \
--zone= ZONE
If maintenance is scheduled or ongoing for a reservation block, then the
output is similar to the following:
---

If maintenance is scheduled for a reservation block, then, to view the
maintenance state of sub-blocks within the reservation block, use the
gcloud compute reservations sub-blocks list command :
gcloud compute reservations sub-blocks list RESERVATION_NAME \
--block-name= BLOCK_NAME \
--zone= ZONE
Replace BLOCK_NAME with the name of a block that
exists within the reservation.
If maintenance is scheduled or ongoing for a reservation sub-block, then
the output is similar to the following:
...
reservationSubBlockMaintenance:
instanceMaintenanceOngoingCount: 0
instanceMaintenancePendingCount: 3
maintenanceOngoingCount: 0
maintenancePendingCount: 32
schedulingType: GROUPED

windowStartTime: '2025-11-13T12:00:00.000-08:00'
...
To view the maintenance state of your reservations, make a GET request
to one of the following methods:
To view reservations across all zones, use the
reservations.aggregatedList method .
To view reservations in a specific zone, use the
reservations.list method .
In the request URL, include the following query parameters:
To only show the name, reserved machine type, and maintenance status
of a reservation, include the fields query parameter set to
items.name,items.specificReservation.instanceProperties.machineType,items.resourceStatus.reservationMaintenance .
To only filter by reservations that specify a specific machine type,
include the filter query parameter set to
specificReservation.instanceProperties.machineType: MACHINE_TYPE
by using URL-encoded values.
For example, to view reservations across all zones, make a GET request
as follows:
GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /aggregated/reservations?fields=items.name,items.specificReservation.instanceProperties.machineType,items.resourceStatus.reservationMaintenance&filter=specificReservation.instanceProperties.machineType%3A MACHINE_TYPE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where the
reservations exist.
MACHINE_TYPE : the reserved machine type that you
want to filter your reservations by.
If maintenance is scheduled or ongoing for a reservation, then the
output is similar to the following:
{
"items": [
{
"specificReservation": {
"instanceProperties": {
"machineType": " MACHINE_TYPE "
}
},
"name": "example-reservation",
"resourceStatus": {
"reservationMaintenance": {
maintenanceOngoingCount: 0,
maintenancePendingCount: 6,

"maintenanceStatus": "PENDING"
}
}
}
},
...
]
}
Optionally, to further narrow down a list of compute instances, set the
filter query parameter to a different
filter expression .
If maintenance is scheduled for your reservation, then, to view the
maintenance state of the blocks within the reservation, make a GET
request to the
reservationBlocks.list method .
In the request URL, include the fields query parameter set to
items.name,items.reservationMaintenance :
GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME /reservationBlocks?fields=items.name,items.reservationMaintenance
Replace RESERVATION_NAME with the name of the
reservation.
If maintenance is scheduled or ongoing for a reservation block, then the
output is similar to the following:
{
"items": [
{
"name": "example-fr-a3u-dense-1-block-0001",
"reservationBlockMaintenance": {
"maintenanceOngoingCount": 0,

"maintenanceStatus": "PENDING",
"maintenanceReasons": [
"PLANNED_UPDATE",
"PLANNED_NETWORK_UPDATE"
]
}
}
},
...
]
}
If the schedulingType field is set to INDEPENDENT for a block, then
the upcomingGroupMaintenance field doesn't contain the
windowStartTime and windowEndTime fields. To see when maintenance is
scheduled for an instance that runs on a reserved block,
view the maintenance state for the instance .
If maintenance is scheduled for a reservation block, then, to view the
maintenance state of the sub-blocks within the reservation block, make a
GET request to the
reservationSubBlocks.list method :
GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME /reservationBlocks/ BLOCK_NAME /reservationSubBlocks
Replace BLOCK_NAME with the name of a block that
exists within the reservation.
If maintenance is scheduled or ongoing for a reservation sub-block, then
the output is similar to the following:
{

Manually start maintenance
You can manually start maintenance for your reservations, reservation blocks, or
reservation sub-blocks instead of waiting for the scheduled time. This action
helps you more proactively control disruptions to your workloads.
Depending on the maintenance state of a reservation, reservation block, or
reservation sub-block, the following occurs:
Maintenance state
Description
What you see
Scheduled
Compute Engine has scheduled maintenance for the reservation.
You can manually start maintenance before the scheduled time.
In the Google Cloud console, the maintenance state shows as
Ready to run - will run on DATE .
In the gcloud CLI or REST API,
Compute Engine sets the maintenanceStatus field
to PENDING .
In progress
Maintenance is underway. You can't reschedule it.
In the Google Cloud console, the maintenance state shows as
Running .
In the gcloud CLI or REST API,
Compute Engine sets the maintenanceStatus field
to ONGOING .
Complete
Maintenance is finished. Compute Engine has removed all
maintenance notifications from the instance.
In the Google Cloud console, the maintenance state shows as
— .
In the gcloud CLI or REST API, the
maintenanceStatus field doesn't exist.
Important: If you
manually start maintenance on individual instances
that exist on a reserved block, then the maintenance state of the reservation,
reservation block, or reservation sub-block might change from PENDING to
ONGOING , and then back to PENDING . This process repeats until maintenance
completes on all instances that exist in a reservation, reservation block, or
reservation sub-block.
To manually start maintenance on specific hosts within a reservation block, or
manually start maintenance on a reservation sub-block, use the
gcloud CLI or REST API. Otherwise, select one of the
following options:
Console gcloud REST

or suspended instances: unused
ZONE : the zone where the reservation exists.
To start maintenance on a reservation, make a POST request to the
reservations.performMaintenance method :
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME /performMaintenance
{
"maintenanceScope": " RESERVATION_MAINTENANCE_SCOPE "
}
To start maintenance on a reservation block, make a POST request to
the
reservationBlocks.performMaintenance method :
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME /reservationBlocks/ BLOCK_NAME /performMaintenance
{
"maintenanceScope": " BLOCK_MAINTENANCE_SCOPE "
}
To start maintenance on a reservation sub-block, make a POST request
to the
reservationSubBlocks.performMaintenance method :
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME /reservationBlocks/ BLOCK_NAME /reservationSubBlocks/ SUB_BLOCK_NAME /performMaintenance
{
"maintenanceScope": " BLOCK_MAINTENANCE_SCOPE "
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where
Compute Engine automatically created the reservation.
ZONE : the zone where the reservation exists.
RESERVATION_NAME : the name of the reservation.
RESERVATION_MAINTENANCE_SCOPE : the maintenance scope
for the reservation. Specify one of the following values:
To start maintenance on all blocks: ALL
To start maintenance only on blocks with running instances: RUNNING
To start maintenance only on unused blocks and blocks with stopped
or suspended instances: UNUSED
BLOCK_NAME : the name of a block that exists within
the reservation.
SUB_BLOCK_NAME : the name of a sub-block that exists
within the reservation block.
BLOCK_MAINTENANCE_SCOPE : the maintenance scope for
the reservation block. Specify one of the following values:
To start maintenance on all hosts: ALL
To start maintenance only on hosts with running instances: RUNNING
To start maintenance only on unused hosts and hosts with stopped
or suspended instances: UNUSED
Manage hardware emergency maintenance notifications
After an instance encounters a host error, or you report its host as faulty, the
instance's host requires emergency, unplanned maintenance. By default,
Compute Engine provides a few hours of advance notice when it schedules
this type of maintenance. For reserved hosts, you can enable emergency
maintenance notifications to increase this notice period to at least seven days.
This approach helps you more proactively control disruptions to your workloads.
Note: After you enable this feature and receive a notification, you can either
let Compute Engine start maintenance at the scheduled date and time, or
you can manually start maintenance before the scheduled
date.
To enable or disable hardware emergency maintenance notifications for a
reservation, select one of the following options:
gcloud REST
More
To enable hardware emergency maintenance notifications for a
reservation, use the
gcloud compute reservations update command
with the --enable-emergent-maintenance flag:
gcloud compute reservations update RESERVATION_NAME \
--enable-emergent-maintenance \
--zone= ZONE
To disable hardware emergency maintenance notifications for a
reservation, use the
gcloud compute reservations update command
with the --no-enable-emergent-maintenance flag:
gcloud compute reservations update RESERVATION_NAME \
--no-enable-emergent-maintenance \
--zone= ZONE
Replace the following:
RESERVATION_NAME : the name of the reservation.
ZONE : the zone where the reservation exists.
To enable or disable hardware emergency maintenance notifications for a
reservation, make a PATCH request to the
reservations.update method .
In the request URL, include the paths query parameter set to
enableEmergentMaintenance .
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME ?paths=enableEmergentMaintenance
{
"name": " RESERVATION_NAME ",
"enableEmergentMaintenance": EMERGENCY_MAINTENANCE_NOTIFICATIONS
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where the
reservation exists.
ZONE : the zone where the reservation exists.
RESERVATION_NAME : the name of the reservation.
EMERGENCY_MAINTENANCE_NOTIFICATIONS : specify one of
the following values:
To enable notifications: true
To disable notifications: false
