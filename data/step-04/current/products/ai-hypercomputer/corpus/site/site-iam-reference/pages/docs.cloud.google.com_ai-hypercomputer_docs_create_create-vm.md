Overview
Creating an instance with the A4 or A3 Ultra machine type includes the following steps:
Create VPC networks
Optional: Create a compact placement policy
Create an instance
Create VPC networks
Tip: If you are setting up a quick test, you can skip this step and specify a
single NIC --network-interface=nic-type=GVNIC instead.
To set up the network for A4 or A3 Ultra machine types, create three VPC
networks for the following network interfaces:
2 regular VPC networks for the gVNIC
network interfaces (NICs). These are used for host to host communication.
1 VPC network with the RoCE network profile
for the CX-7 NICs.
The RoCE VPC network needs to have 8 subnets, one subnet for
each CX-7 NIC. These NICs use RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE),
providing the high-bandwidth, low-latency communication that's essential for
GPU to GPU communication.
For more information about NIC arrangement, see
Review network bandwidth and NIC arrangement .
Create the networks either manually by following the instruction guides or automatically by using
the provided script.
Instruction guides Script
More
To create the networks, you can use the following instructions:
To create the regular VPC networks for the gVNICs, see
Create and manage Virtual Private Cloud networks .
To create the RoCE VPC network, see
Create a Virtual Private Cloud network for RDMA NICs .
For these VPC networks, we recommend setting the
maximum transmission unit (MTU) to a larger value.
For A4 or A3 Ultra machine types, the recommended MTU is 8896 bytes.
To review the recommended MTU settings for other GPU machine types, see
MTU settings for GPU machine types .
To create the networks, follow these steps.
For these VPC networks, we recommend setting the
maximum transmission unit (MTU) to a larger value.
For A4 or A3 Ultra machine types, the recommended MTU is 8896 bytes.
To review the recommended MTU settings for other GPU machine types, see
MTU settings for GPU machine types .
Use the following script to create VPC networks for the gVNICs and CX-7 NICs.
#!/bin/bash
# Create regular VPC networks and subnets for the gVNICs
for N in $(seq 0 1); do
gcloud compute networks create GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX -net-$N \
--subnet-mode=custom \
--mtu=8896
gcloud compute networks subnets create GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX -sub-$N \
--network= GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX -net-$N \
--region= REGION \
--range=10.$N.0.0/16
gcloud compute firewall-rules create GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX -internal-$N \
--network= GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX -net-$N \
--action=ALLOW \
--rules=tcp:0-65535,udp:0-65535,icmp \
--source-ranges=10.0.0.0/8
done
# Create SSH firewall rules
gcloud compute firewall-rules create GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX -ssh \
--network= GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX -net-0 \
--action=ALLOW \
--rules=tcp:22 \
--source-ranges= IP_RANGE
# Assumes that an external IP is only created for vNIC 0
gcloud compute firewall-rules create GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX -allow-ping-net-0 \
--network= GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX -net-0 \
--action=ALLOW \
--rules=icmp \
--source-ranges= IP_RANGE
#!/bin/bash
# List and make sure network profiles exist in the machine type's zone
gcloud compute network-profiles list --filter "location.name= ZONE "
# Create network for RDMA NICs
gcloud compute networks create RDMA_NAME_PREFIX -mrdma \
--network-profile= ZONE -vpc-roce \
--subnet-mode custom \
--mtu=8896
# Create subnets
for N in $(seq 0 7); do
gcloud compute networks subnets create RDMA_NAME_PREFIX -mrdma-sub-$N \
--network= RDMA_NAME_PREFIX -mrdma \
--region= REGION \
--range=10.$((N+2)).0.0/16 # offset to avoid overlap with gVNICs
done
Replace the following:
GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX : the custom name prefix to use for the regular
VPC networks and subnets for the gVNICs.
RDMA_NAME_PREFIX : the custom name prefix to use for the RoCE
VPC network and subnets for the CX-7 NICs.
ZONE : specify a zone in which the machine type that you want to
use is available, such as us-central1-a . For information about regions, see
GPU availability by regions and zones .
REGION : the region where you want to create the
subnets. This region must correspond to the zone specified. For example,
if your zone is us-central1-a , then your region is us-central1 .
IP_RANGE : the IP range to use for the
SSH firewall rules .
Optional: To verify that the VPC network resources are created successfully, check the network settings in the Google Cloud console:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks page.
Go to VPC networks
Search the list for the networks that you created in the previous step.
To view the subnets, firewall rules, and other network settings, click the name of the network.
Optional: Create a compact placement policy
Tip: To place your VMs in single or adjacent blocks, specify VM
placement by creating and applying a placement policy to your VMs. To place VMs on a specific
block, skip this step and provide the name of the block when you create VMs.
You can specify VM placement by creating a compact placement policy. When you apply a compact
placement policy to your VMs, Compute Engine makes best-effort attempts to create VMs that
are as close to each other as possible. If your application is latency-sensitive and requires
maximum compactness, then specify the maxDistance field
( Preview ) when you create a
compact placement policy. A lower maxDistance value ensures closer VM placement, but
it also increases the chance that some VMs won't be created.
To create a compact placement policy, select one of the following options:
gcloud REST
More
To create a compact placement policy, use the
gcloud beta compute resource-policies create group-placement command :
gcloud beta compute resource-policies create group-placement POLICY_NAME \
--collocation=collocated \
--max-distance= MAX_DISTANCE \
--region= REGION
Replace the following:
POLICY_NAME : the name of the compact placement policy.
MAX_DISTANCE : the maximum distance configuration for your VMs. The
value must be 3 to place VMs in the adjacent blocks, or 2 to place VMs
in the same block. For information about the maximum number of VMs supported for each
maxDistance per machine series, see
About compact placement policies
in the Compute Engine documentation.
REGION : the region where you want to create the compact placement policy.
Specify a region in which the machine type that you want to use is available. For information
about regions, see
GPU availability by regions and zones .
To create a compact placement policy, make a POST request to the
beta
resourcePolicies.insert method .
In the request body, include the
collocation field set to COLLOCATED , and the maxDistance
field.
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /resourcePolicies
{
"name": " POLICY_NAME ",
"groupPlacementPolicy": {
"collocation": "COLLOCATED",
"maxDistance": MAX_DISTANCE
}
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID.
POLICY_NAME : the name of the compact placement policy.
MAX_DISTANCE : the maximum distance configuration for your VMs. The
value must be 3 to place VMs in the adjacent blocks, or 2 to place VMs
in the same block. For information about the maximum number of VMs supported for each
maxDistance per machine series, see
About compact placement policies
in the Compute Engine documentation.
REGION : the region where you want to create the compact placement policy.
Specify a region in which the machine type that you want to use is available. For information
about regions, see
GPU availability by regions and zones .
Create an A4 or A3 Ultra VM
To create an A4 or A3 Ultra VM that specifies a compact placement policy, use
the Google Cloud CLI or REST API. Otherwise, select one of the following
options:
The following commands also set the access scope for your instances. To simplify permissions
management, Google recommends that you set the access scope on an instance to
cloud-platform access and then use IAM roles to define what services the instance can
access. For more information, see
Scopes best practice .

creating the VPC networks and subnets that use RDMA NICs.
RESERVATION : either the reservation name or a specific block within a
reservation. To get the reservation name or the available blocks, see View reserved capacity . Based on your
requirement for instance placement, choose one of the following:
To create the instance on any block:
projects/ RESERVATION_OWNER_PROJECT_ID /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME
Additionally,
to create multiple instances in the same block, apply the same compact placement policy
that specifies a block collocation ( maxDistance=2 )
when creating each instance.
Compute Engine then applies the policy to the reservation and creates instances on the
same block.
To create the instance on a specific block:
projects/ RESERVATION_OWNER_PROJECT_ID /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME /reservationBlocks/ RESERVATION_BLOCK_NAME
Tip: If the reservation exists in the current project, then you can omit
projects/ RESERVATION_OWNER_PROJECT_ID /reservations/ from the reservation
value.

Complete the following steps:
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the project where you want to create the
VM.
ZONE : the zone in which the machine type that you want to
use is available.
If you want to specify a compact placement policy, then
you must use a zone in the same region as the compact placement policy.
For information about regions, see
GPU availability by regions and zones .
MACHINE_TYPE : the machine type to use for the VM. For more information,
see GPU machine types .
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the VM.
DISK_SIZE : the size of the boot disk in GB.
IMAGE_PROJECT : the project ID of the OS image.
IMAGE_FAMILY : the image family of the OS image that you want to use.
For a list of supported operating systems, see Operating system details .
NETWORK_PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the network.
GVNIC_NAME_PREFIX : the name prefix that you specified when
creating the standard VPC networks and subnets that use gVNICs.
REGION : the region of the subnetwork.
RDMA_NAME_PREFIX : the name prefix that you specified when
creating the VPC networks and subnets that use RDMA NICs.
REQUEST_VALID_FOR_DURATION : the duration, in seconds, that the
request to create the VM remains valid.
Based on the zonal requirements for your workload, specify one of the following durations to help
increase your chances that your VM creation request succeeds:
Workloads with strict zonal requirements : if your workload requires you to create the
VM in a specific zone, then specify a duration between 90 seconds ( 90 ) and two
hours ( 7200 ). Longer durations give you higher chances of obtaining resources.
Workloads without strict zonal requirements : if the VM can run in any zone within the
region, then specify a duration of zero seconds ( 0 ). This action specifies that
Compute Engine only allocates resources if they are immediately available. If the VM creation
request fails because resources are unavailable, then retry the request in a different zone.
MAX_RUN_DURATION : the duration you want the requested VMs to run. You
must format the value as the number of seconds. For example, specify 86400 for 86,400
seconds (24 hours). The value must be between 10 minutes and seven days.
TERMINATION_ACTION : whether Compute Engine stops
( STOP ) or deletes ( DELETE ) the VM at the end of its run duration.
