How to obtain capacity
AI Hypercomputer supports several
consumption options
to help you get and use compute resources. This document provides an overview of
how you can obtain capacity for each consumption option.
How to obtain capacity
The following table describes how you can obtain capacity for each consumption
option.
Consumption option
Process for obtaining capacity
Pricing implications
Future reservations in AI Hypercomputer
To get future reservation resources, the process is as follows:
Reserve capacity
by contacting your account team.
Quota is automatically increased before capacity is delivered. No
action is required from you.
When you
create a
Compute Engine instance or cluster , specify the reservation-bound
provisioning model. Compute instances and clusters are provisioned from
your reserved capacity.
You're charged for the entire reservation period, whether or not you use
the reserved resources for the entire period. For more information, see the
Reservation billing section of the Compute Engine reservations
documentation.
Future reservations for less than 90 days (in calendar mode)
To get future reservation resources, the process is as follows:
Search for available capacity and reserve resources by using the
Google Cloud console, gcloud CLI, or Compute Engine API .
No quota is charged and no action is required from you.
When you
create a compute
instance or cluster , you must specify the reservation-bound
provisioning model. Compute instances and clusters are provisioned from
your reserved capacity.
You're charged for the entire reservation period, whether or not you use
the reserved resources for the entire period. For more information, see
Dynamic Workload Scheduler pricing .
Flex-start
For this consumption option, no reservation is required . To get
Flex-start resources, the process is as follows:
You must request
preemptible quota for the GPU
machine type that you want to use.
When you create compute instances or clusters by using one of the
following options, specify the flex-start provisioning model:
Create a
standalone virtual machine (VM) instance
Create MIGs with resize requests
Create Slurm clusters
Create GKE clusters:
Create a cluster with the default configuration
Create a custom cluster
When your requested capacity becomes available, Compute Engine
provisions it. You obtain resources for up to seven days.
You're charged when the resources are in use. Resources provisioned
using Flex-start automatically get discounts through
Dynamic Workload Scheduler pricing .
Spot
For this consumption option, no reservation is required . To get
Spot resources, the process is as follows:
You must request
preemptible quota for the GPU
machine type that you want to use.
When you
create a compute
instance or cluster , specify the spot provisioning model. Resources
are provisioned for you as capacity becomes available, but can be
preempted at any time.
You're charged when the resources are in use. Spot VMs
automatically get discounts through
Spot VMs
pricing .
