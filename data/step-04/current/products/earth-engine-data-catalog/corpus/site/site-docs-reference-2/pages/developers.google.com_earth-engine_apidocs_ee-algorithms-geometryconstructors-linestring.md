Earth Engine is introducing noncommercial quota tiers to safeguard shared compute resources and ensure reliable performance for everyone. All noncommercial projects will need to select a quota tier by April 27, 2026 or will use the Community Tier by default. Tier quotas will take effect for all projects (regardless of tier selection date) on April 27, 2026 . Learn more.

Constructs a LineString from the given coordinates.
Usage Returns ee.Algorithms.GeometryConstructors.LineString(coordinates, crs , geodesic , maxError ) Geometry Argument Type Details coordinates List The list of Points or pairs of Numbers in x,y order. crs Projection, default: null The coordinate reference system of the coordinates. The default is the projection of the inputs, where Numbers are assumed to be EPSG:4326. geodesic Boolean, default: null If false, edges are straight in the projection. If true, edges are curved to follow the shortest path on the surface of the Earth. The default is the geodesic state of the inputs, or true if the inputs are numbers. maxError ErrorMargin, default: null Max error when input geometry must be reprojected to an explicitly requested result projection or geodesic state.
