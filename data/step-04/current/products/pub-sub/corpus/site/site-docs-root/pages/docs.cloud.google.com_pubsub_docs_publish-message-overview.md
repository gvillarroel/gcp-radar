Publish message overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
To publish a message with Pub/Sub, a publisher application
creates and sends messages to a topic.
This document provides an overview about the publish workflow, including the
concept of topics and messages.
About topics
A Pub/Sub topic is a named resource that represents a feed of
messages. When a publisher sends a message, it targets a specific topic. The
Pub/Sub service uses this topic name to route the message to all
subscriptions attached to the topic. If there are multiple subscribers for a
subscription, only one subscriber in the subscription receives the message.
Publishers don't have to know how many subscribers exist. They focus
on the topic, ensuring the separation of concerns between message sending
and message receiving.
Pub/Sub supports two kinds of topics: a standard topic
and an import topic.
Properties of a topic
When you create or update a topic, you can specify the topic properties.
For more information about the topic properties, see Properties of a topic .
About import topics
An import topic lets Pub/Sub ingest streaming data from
another source and act as the publisher application that sends the data to
the topic. You can enable ingestion on a
topic by using the console, Google Cloud CLI, REST
calls, or the client libraries. As part of managing the import topic,
Google Cloud provides monitoring and scaling of the ingestion pipeline.
Without an import topic, streaming data into Pub/Sub from a data
source requires an additional service. This additional service pulls
data from the original source and publishes it to Pub/Sub. The
additional service can be a streaming engine such as Apache Spark or a
custom-written service. You must also configure, deploy, run, scale, and
monitor this service.
The following is a list of important information regarding import topics:
Similar to a standard topic, you can still manually publish to an
import topic.
You can only attach a single ingestion source to an import topic.
We recommend import topics for streaming data. If you are considering
batch data ingestion into BigQuery instead of streaming
data ingestion, you can try
BigQuery Data Transfer Service .
If you want to ingest data into Cloud Storage,
Storage Transfer Service
(STS) is a good option.
Pub/Sub supports the following sources for
import topics:
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
Cloud Storage
Azure Event Hubs
Amazon MSK
Confluent Cloud
Data replication in a topic
A Pub/Sub topic uses three zones to store data. The service
supports synchronous replication to at least two zones, and best-effort
replication to an additional third zone. Pub/Sub replication is
within just one region.
About messages
A Pub/Sub message is the data that moves through the service.
A message consists of fields with the message data and metadata. A message
must contain either message data or at least one attribute.
The message data : This is the core content of the message and can be
any text or binary data. It represents the actual information
you want to communicate between publishers and subscribers. If you're using
the REST API directly,
the message data must be base64-encoded.
See the example in the REST tab in the Publish messages section.
An ordering key : This is an optional
identifier that represents the entity for which messages must be ordered.
Messages with the same ordering key are expected to be delivered to
a subscriber in the order they were published. An ordering key is only
required if you want ordered delivery of your messages. For more information
about ordering keys, see Order message .
Attributes : These are optional key-value pairs that provide additional
context and information about the message. They can be used for routing,
filtering, or enriching the message content. For example, you could add
attributes such as timestamps or transaction IDs.
For more information about attributes used in publishing messages, see
Use attributes to publish a message .
The Pub/Sub service adds the following fields to the message:
A message ID unique to the topic
A timestamp for when the Pub/Sub service receives the message
For example, here is a message format in JSON :
{
"data" : "This is the core message content." ,
"attributes" : {
"category" : "notification" ,
"user_id" : "12345" ,
"priority" : "medium"
},
"orderingKey" : "12345"
}
When publishing messages using Pub/Sub client libraries,
provide the message data as a byte array, such as a Node.js
Buffer . If your data is a string, you must first encode it to bytes, for
example by using UTF-8 encoding, before passing it to the client library.
If you're using the REST API directly,
the message data must be base64-encoded and sent as a string.
Publish message workflow
To publish a message with Pub/Sub, a publisher application creates
and sends messages to a topic .
Create a message containing your data.
Select any optional publishing attributes.
Send a request to the Pub/Sub server to publish the message
to a specified topic.
The Pub/Sub service receives the message and processes it as follows:
The message is stored for distribution.
The message is replicated across multiple zones for durability and high availability.
Pub/Sub identifies subscribers with subscriptions matching
the message's topic, and delivers a copy of the message to each.
Pub/Sub offers at-least-once message delivery and best-effort ordering to
existing subscribers.
For more information about the Pub/Sub system, see
Overview of the Pub/Sub service .
