This document describes how to integrate Apache Kafka and Pub/Sub by
using the Pub/Sub Group Kafka Connector.
Note: You can also use this connector with Pub/Sub Lite. See
Connect Pub/Sub Lite to Apache Kafka .
About the Pub/Sub Group Kafka Connector
Apache Kafka is an open source platform for streaming events. It is commonly
used in distributed architectures to enable communication between loosely
coupled components. Pub/Sub is a managed service for sending and
receiving messages asynchronously. As with Kafka, you can use
Pub/Sub to communicate between components in your cloud
architecture.
The Pub/Sub Group Kafka Connector allows you to integrate these two systems.
The following connectors are packaged in the Connector JAR:
The sink connector reads records from one or more Kafka topics and
publishes them to Pub/Sub.
The source connector reads messages from a Pub/Sub topic
and publishes them to Kafka.
Here are some scenarios in which you might use the Pub/Sub Group Kafka Connector:
You are migrating a Kafka-based architecture to Google Cloud.
You have a frontend system that stores events in Kafka outside of
Google Cloud, but you also use Google Cloud to run some of your backend
services, which need to receive the Kafka events.
You collect logs from an on-premises Kafka solution and send them to
Google Cloud for data analytics.
You have a frontend system that uses Google Cloud, but you also store data
on-premises using Kafka.
The connector requires
Kafka Connect ,
which is a framework for streaming data between Kafka and other systems. To use
the connector, you must run Kafka Connect alongside your Kafka cluster.
This document assumes that you are familiar with both Kafka and
Pub/Sub. Before you read this document, it's a good idea to
complete one of the
Pub/Sub quickstarts .
The Pub/Sub connector does not support any integration
between Google Cloud IAM and Kafka Connect ACLs.
Get started with the connector
This section walks you through the following tasks:
Configure the Pub/Sub Group Kafka Connector.
Send events from Kafka to Pub/Sub.
Send messages from Pub/Sub to Kafka.
Note: This section uses Kafka Connect in standalone mode, which is suitable for
testing. For production systems, distributed mode is recommended. For
information about running Kafka Connect in distributed mode, see
Running Kafka Connect
in the Apache Kafka documentation.
Prerequisites
Install Kafka
Follow the
Apache Kafka quickstart
to install a single-node Kafka on your local machine. Complete these steps in
the quickstart:
Download the latest Kafka release and extract it.
Start the Kafka environment.
Create a Kafka topic.
Authenticate
The Pub/Sub Group Kafka Connector must authenticate with Pub/Sub in order
to send and receive Pub/Sub messages. To set up authentication,
perform the following steps:
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Create local authentication credentials for your user account:
gcloud auth application-default login
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/pubsub.admin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.

gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Create local authentication credentials for your user account:
gcloud auth application-default login
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/pubsub.admin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Note: For production workloads, we recommend using
Workload identity federation to
authenticate.
Download the connector JAR
Download the connector JAR file to your local machine. For more information, see
Acquire the connector
in the GitHub readme.
Copy the connector configuration files
Clone or download the
GitHub repository
for the connector.
git clone https://github.com/googleapis/java-pubsub-group-kafka-connector.git
cd java-pubsub-group-kafka-connector
Copy the contents of the config directory into the config subdirectory of
your Kafka installation.
cp config/* [ path to Kafka installation ] /config/
These files contain configuration settings for the connector.
Update your Kafka Connect configuration
Navigate to the directory that contains the Kafka Connect binary that you
downloaded.
In the Kafka Connect binary directory, open the file named
config/connect-standalone.properties in a text editor.
If the plugin.path property is commented out, uncomment it.
Update the plugin.path property to include the path to the connector JAR.
Example:
plugin.path = /home/PubSubKafkaConnector/pubsub-group-kafka-connector-1.0.0.jar
Set the offset.storage.file.filename property to a local file name. In
standalone mode, Kafka uses this file to store offset data.
Example:
offset.storage.file.filename = /tmp/connect.offsets
Forward events from Kafka to Pub/Sub
This section describes how to start the sink connector, publish events to Kafka,
and then read the forwarded messages from Pub/Sub.
Use the Google Cloud CLI to create a Pub/Sub topic with a
subscription.
gcloud pubsub topics create PUBSUB_TOPIC
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION --topic = PUBSUB_TOPIC
Replace the following:
PUBSUB_TOPIC : The name of a Pub/Sub topic to
receive the messages from Kafka.
PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION : The name of a Pub/Sub
subscription for the topic.
Open the file /config/cps-sink-connector.properties in a text editor. Add
values for the following properties, which are marked "TODO" in the
comments:
topics = KAFKA_TOPICS
cps.project = PROJECT_ID
cps.topic = PUBSUB_TOPIC
Replace the following:
KAFKA_TOPICS : A comma-separated list of Kafka topics to read
from.
PROJECT_ID : The Google Cloud project that contains your
Pub/Sub topic.
PUBSUB_TOPIC : The Pub/Sub topic to receive the
messages from Kafka.
From the Kafka directory, run the following command:
bin/connect-standalone.sh \
config/connect-standalone.properties \
config/cps-sink-connector.properties
Follow the steps in the
Apache Kafka quickstart
to write some events to your Kafka topic.
Use the gcloud CLI to read the events from Pub/Sub.
gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION --auto-ack
Forward messages from Pub/Sub to Kafka
This section describes how to start the source connector, publish messages to
Pub/Sub, and read the forwarded messages from Kafka.
Use the gcloud CLI to create a Pub/Sub topic with a
subscription.
gcloud pubsub topics create PUBSUB_TOPIC
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION --topic = PUBSUB_TOPIC
Replace the following:
PUBSUB_TOPIC : The name of a Pub/Sub topic.
PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION : The name of a Pub/Sub
subscription.
Open the file named /config/cps-source-connector.properties in a text
editor. Add values for the following properties, which are marked "TODO" in
the comments:
kafka.topic = KAFKA_TOPIC
cps.project = PROJECT_ID
cps.subscription = PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION
Replace the following:
KAFKA_TOPIC : The Kafka topics to receive the
Pub/Sub messages.
PROJECT_ID : The Google Cloud project that contains your
Pub/Sub topic.
PUBSUB_TOPIC : The Pub/Sub topic.
From the Kafka directory, run the following command:
bin/connect-standalone.sh \
config/connect-standalone.properties \
config/cps-source-connector.properties
Use the gcloud CLI to publish a message to Pub/Sub.
gcloud pubsub topics publish PUBSUB_TOPIC --message = "message 1"
Read the message from Kafka. Follow the steps in the
Apache Kafka quickstart
to read the messages from the Kafka topic.
Message conversion
A Kafka record
contains a key and a value, which are variable-length byte arrays. Optionally, a
Kafka record can also have headers, which are key-value pairs. A
Pub/Sub message
has two main parts: the message body and zero or more key-value attributes.
Kafka Connect uses converters to serialize keys and values to and from Kafka.
To control the serialization, set the following properties in the connector
configuration files:
key.converter : The converter used to serialize record keys.
value.converter : The converter used to serialize record values.
The body of a Pub/Sub message is a ByteString object, so the
most efficient conversion is to copy the payload directly. For that reason, we
recommend using a converter that produces primitive data types (integer, float,
string, or bytes schema) where possible, to prevent deserializing and
reserializing the same message body.
Conversion from Kafka to Pub/Sub
The sink connector converts Kafka records to Pub/Sub messages as
follows:
The Kafka record key is stored as an attribute named "key" in the
Pub/Sub message.
By default, the connector drops any headers in the Kafka record. However, if
you set the headers.publish configuration option to true , the connector
writes the headers as Pub/Sub attributes. The connector skips
any headers that exceed the Pub/Sub
limits on message attributes .
For integer, float, string, and bytes schemas, the connector passes the bytes
of the Kafka record value directly into the Pub/Sub message
body.
For struct schemas, the connector writes each field as an attribute of the
Pub/Sub message. For example, if the field is { "id"=123 } ,
the resulting Pub/Sub message has an attribute "id"="123" . The
field value is always converted to a string. Map and struct types are not
supported as field types within a struct.
For map schemas, the connector writes each key-value pair as an attribute of
the Pub/Sub message. For example, if the map is
{"alice"=1,"bob"=2} , the resulting Pub/Sub message has two
attributes, "alice"="1" and "bob"="2" . The keys and values are converted
to strings.
Struct and map schemas have some additional behaviors:
Optionally, you can specify a particular struct field or map key to be the
message body, by setting the messageBodyName configuration property. The
value of the field or key is stored as a ByteString in the message body. If
you don't set messageBodyName , then the message body is empty for struct and
map schemas.
For array values, the connector supports only primitive array types. The
sequence of values in the array is concatenated into a single ByteString
object.
Conversion from Pub/Sub to Kafka
The source connector converts Pub/Sub messages to Kafka records
as follows:
Kafka record key : By default, the key is set to null . Optionally, you
can specify a Pub/Sub message attribute to use as the key, by
setting the kafka.key.attribute configuration option. In that case, the
connector looks for an attribute with that name and sets the record key to the
attribute value. If the specified attribute is not present, the record key is
set to null .
Kafka record value . The connector writes the record value as follows:
If the Pub/Sub message has no custom attributes, the connector
writes the Pub/Sub message body directly to the Kafka record
value as a byte[] type, using the converter specified by
value.converter .
If the Pub/Sub message has custom attributes and
kafka.record.headers is false , the connector writes a struct to the
record value. The struct contains one field for each attribute, and a field
named "message" whose value is the Pub/Sub message body
(stored as bytes):
{
"message": "<Pub/Sub message body>",
"<attribute-1>": "<value-1>",
"<attribute-2>": "<value-2>",
....
}
In this case, you must use a value.converter that is compatible with
struct schemas, such as org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter .
If the Pub/Sub message has custom attributes and
kafka.record.headers is true , the connector writes the attributes as
Kafka record headers. It writes the Pub/Sub message body
directly to the Kafka record value as a byte[] type, using the converter
specified by value.converter .
Kafka record headers . By default, the headers are empty, unless you set
kafka.record.headers to true .
Note: In your Kafka broker configuration, set message.max.bytes large enough
to handle your Pub/Sub messages. Pub/Sub has a
maximum message size .
Configuration options
In addition to the configurations provided by the Kafka Connect API, the
Pub/Sub Group Kafka Connector supports the sink and source configuration as
described in
Pub/Sub connector configs .
