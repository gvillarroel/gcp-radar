Create a Cloud Storage import topic
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A Cloud Storage import topic lets you continuously ingest data from
Cloud Storage into Pub/Sub. Then you can stream the data
into any of the destinations that Pub/Sub supports. Pub/Sub
automatically detects new objects added to the Cloud Storage bucket
and ingests them.
Cloud Storage is a service for storing your objects in
Google Cloud. An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a
file of any format. You store objects in containers called buckets .
Buckets can also contain managed folders, which you use to provide expanded
access to groups of objects with a shared name prefix.
For more information about Cloud Storage, see the
Cloud Storage documentation .
For more information about import topics,
see About import topics .
Before you begin
Learn more about the Pub/Sub publish process .
A Cloud Storage bucket must already exist before you create
a Cloud Storage import topic. If you are using the console to
create the import topic, the workflow
lets you create a Cloud Storage bucket.
For other configuration methods, see Create buckets .
If applicable, ensure that the message storage policy of the Pub/Sub topic
overlaps with the region where your Cloud Storage bucket is located.
For more information, see
Message storage policy is compliant with the bucket location .
Some Google Cloud services have Google Cloud-managed service accounts that
lets the services access your resources. These service accounts are known as
service agents. Pub/Sub creates and maintains a service
account for each project in the format
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Configure the required roles and permissions on the Pub/Sub
service account to manage Cloud Storage
import topics including the following:
Grant the
Pub/Sub publisher role ( roles/pubsub.publisher ) to the
Pub/Sub service account. This service account is going
to publish to the import topic. To grant this role, you require
a user account with the
Pub/Sub Admin role ( roles/pubsub.admin ) .
For more information, see
Add the Pub/Sub publisher role to the Pub/Sub service account .
Grant Cloud Storage permissions to the Pub/Sub
service account. To grant these permissions, you require
a user account with the
Storage Admin role ( roles/storage.admin ) .
For more information, see
Assign Cloud Storage roles to the Pub/Sub service account .
Required roles and permissions
To get the permissions that
you need to create and manage a Cloud Storage import topic,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Pub/Sub Editor ( roles/pubsub.editor )
IAM role on your topic or project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to create and manage a Cloud Storage import topic. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to create and manage a Cloud Storage import topic:
Create an import topic:
pubsub.topics.create
Delete an import topic:
pubsub.topics.delete
Get an import topic:
pubsub.topics.get
List an import topic:
pubsub.topics.list
Publish to an import topic:
pubsub.topics.publish
Update an import topic:
pubsub.topics.update
Get the IAM policy for an import topic:
pubsub.topics.getIamPolicy
Configure the IAM policy for an import topic:
pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
You can configure access control at the project level and the
individual resource level.
Message storage policy is compliant with the bucket location
Note: This section only applies if you have a message storage policy for Pub/Sub.
To check if your topic has a message storage policy and, if required,
to update the message storage policy, see
Update message storage policies .
The message storage policy of the Pub/Sub topic must overlap
with the regions where your Cloud Storage bucket is located. This policy
dictates where Pub/Sub is allowed to store your message data.
For buckets with location type as region: The policy must include that
specific region. For example, if your bucket is in the us-central1 region,
the message storage policy must also include us-central1 .
For buckets with location type as dual-region or multi-region: The policy
must include at least one region within the dual-region or multi-region
location. For example, if your bucket is in the US multi-region ,
the message storage policy could include us-central1 , us-east1 , or
any other region within the US multi-region .
If the policy doesn't include the bucket's region, topic creation fails. For
example, if your bucket is in europe-west1 and your message storage
policy only includes asia-east1 , you'll receive an error.
If the message storage policy includes only one region that overlaps with the
bucket's location, multi-region redundancy might be compromised. This is
because if that single region becomes unavailable, your data might not be
accessible. To ensure full redundancy, it's recommended to include at least
two regions within the message storage policy that are part of the bucket's
multi-region or dual-region location.
For more information about the bucket locations, see
the documentation .
Enable publishing
To enable publishing, you must assign the Pub/Sub publisher role
to the Pub/Sub service account so that Pub/Sub
is able to publish to the Cloud Storage import topic.
Enable publishing to all Cloud Storage import topics
Choose this option when you don't have a Cloud Storage import
topic available in your project.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Select the Include Google-provided role grants checkbox.
Look for the Pub/Sub service account that has the format:
service-{PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com
For this service account, click the Edit Principal button.
If required, click Add another role .
Search and select the Pub/Sub publisher role ( roles/pubsub.publisher ).
Click Save .
Enable publishing to a single Cloud Storage import topic
If you want to grant Pub/Sub the permission to publish to a specific
Cloud Storage import topic that already exists,
follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Run the gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding command:
gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding TOPIC_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/pubsub.publisher"
Replace the following:
TOPIC_ID is the ID or name of the Cloud Storage import topic.
PROJECT_NUMBER is the project number. To view the project
number, see Identifying projects .
Assign Cloud Storage roles to the Pub/Sub service account
To create a Cloud Storage import topic, the Pub/Sub
service account must have permission to read from the
specific Cloud Storage bucket. The following permissions are required:
storage.objects.list
storage.objects.get
storage.buckets.get
To assign these permissions to the Pub/Sub service account,
choose one of the following procedures:
Grant permissions at the bucket level. On the specific Cloud Storage
bucket, grant the Storage Legacy Object Reader
( roles/storage.legacyObjectReader ) role and the
Storage Legacy Bucket Reader ( roles/storage.legacyBucketReader ) roles to the
Pub/Sub service account.
If you must grant roles at the project level, you might instead grant
the Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin ) role on the project containing
the Cloud Storage bucket. Grant this role to the
Pub/Sub service account.
Bucket permissions
Perform the following steps to grant the Storage Legacy Object Reader
( roles/storage.legacyObjectReader ) role and the
Storage Legacy Bucket Reader ( roles/storage.legacyBucketReader ) roles to the
Pub/Sub service account at the bucket level:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage page.
Go to Cloud Storage
Click the Cloud Storage bucket from which you would like to
read messages and import to the Cloud Storage import topic.
The Bucket details page opens.
In the Bucket details page, click the Permissions tab.
In the Permissions > View by Principals tab, click Grant access .
The Grant access page opens.
In the Add Principals section, enter the name of your Pub/Sub
service account.
The format of the service account is
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
For example, for a project with PROJECT_NUMBER = 112233445566 ,
the service account is of the format
service-112233445566@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
In the Assign roles > Select a role drop-down,
enter Object Reader and select the Storage Legacy Object Reader role.
Click Add another role .
In the Select a role drop-down, enter Bucket Reader ,
and select the Storage Legacy Bucket Reader role.
Click Save .
Project permissions
Perform the following steps to grant the Storage Admin
( roles/storage.admin ) role at the project level:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
In the Permissions > View by Principals tab, click Grant access .
The Grant access page opens.
In the Add Principals section, enter the name of your Pub/Sub
service account.
The format of the service account is
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
For example, for a project with PROJECT_NUMBER = 112233445566 ,
the service account is of the format
service-112233445566@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
In the Assign roles > Select a role drop-down,
enter Storage Admin and select the Storage Admin role.
Click Save .

Properties of Cloud Storage import topics
For more information about the common properties across all topics,
see Properties of a topic .
Bucket name
This is the name of the Cloud Storage bucket from which
Pub/Sub reads the data that is published to a
Cloud Storage import topic.
Input format
When you create a Cloud Storage import topic, you can
specify the format of the objects to be ingested as Text , Avro , or
Pub/Sub Avro .
Text . Objects are assumed to hold data with plain text. This input
format attempts to ingest all objects in the bucket as long as the object
meets the minimum object creation time
and matches the glob pattern criteria .
Delimiter . You can also specify a delimiter by which objects are split
into messages. If unset, this defaults to the newline character ( \n ).
The delimiter must only be a single character.
Avro . Objects are in the
Apache Avro binary format.
Any object that is not in a valid Apache Avro format is not ingested.
Here are the limitations regarding Avro:
Avro versions 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 are not supported.
The maximum size of an Avro block is 16 MB.
Pub/Sub Avro . Objects are in the Apache Avro binary format with a
schema matching that of an object written to Cloud Storage
using a Pub/Sub Cloud Storage subscription
with the Avro file format .
Here are some important guidelines for Pub/Sub Avro:
The data field of the Avro record is used to populate the data field
of the generated Pub/Sub message.
If the
write_metadata option
is specified for the Cloud Storage
subscription, any values in the attributes field are populated as
the attributes of the generated Pub/Sub message.
If an ordering key is specified in the
original message written to Cloud Storage, this field is
populated as an attribute with the
name original_message_ordering_key in the generated
Pub/Sub message.
Minimum object creation time
You can optionally specify a minimum object creation time when creating a
Cloud Storage import topic. Only objects that were created at or after
this timestamp are ingested. This timestamp must be provided
in a format like YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ .
Any date, past or future,
from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z inclusive, is valid.
Match glob pattern
You can optionally specify a match glob pattern when creating a
Cloud Storage import topic. Only objects with names that match this pattern
are ingested. For example, to ingest all object with suffix .txt ,
you can specify the glob pattern as **.txt .
For information about
supported syntax for glob patterns, see the Cloud Storage documentation .
Use Cloud Storage import topics
You can create a new import topic or edit an existing topic.
Considerations
Caution: If you already have data in the Cloud Storage bucket, first
create a standard topic and the required subscriptions
without enabling the ingestion settings. Then,
convert the topic to a Cloud Storage import topic .
This method ensures that all messages are received by the subscriptions.
Creating the topic and subscription separately, even if done in rapid
succession, can lead to data loss. There's a short window where the topic
exists without a subscription. If any data is sent to the topic during this
time, it is lost. By creating the topic first, creating the subscription,
and then converting the topic to an import topic, you guarantee that no
messages are missed during the import process.
Create a Cloud Storage import topic
To create a Cloud Storage import topic, follow these steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Topics page.
Go to Topics
Click Create topic .
The topic details page opens.
In the Topic ID field, enter an ID for your
Cloud Storage import topic.
For more information about naming topics, see the naming guidelines .
Select Add a default subscription .
Select Enable ingestion .
For ingestion source, select Google Cloud Storage .
For the Cloud Storage bucket, click Browse .
The Select bucket page opens. Select one of the following options:
Select an existing bucket from any appropriate project.
Click the create icon and follow the instructions on the screen to
create a new bucket. After you create the bucket, select the bucket
for the Cloud Storage import topic.
When you specify the bucket, Pub/Sub checks for the
appropriate permissions on the bucket for the Pub/Sub
service account. If there are permissions issues, you see a message
similar to the following:
Unable to verify if the Pub/Sub service
agent has write permissions on this bucket. You may be
lacking permissions to view or set
permissions.
If you get permission issues, click Set permissions . For more
information, see Grant Cloud Storage
permissions to the Pub/Sub service account .
For Object format , select Text , Avro , or Pub/Sub
Avro .
If you select Text , you can optionally specify a Delimiter
with which to split objects into messages.
For more information about these options, see Input format .
Optional. You can specify a Minimum object creation time for your
topic. If set, only objects created after the minimum object creation time
are ingested.
For more information see Minimum object creation time .
You must specify a Glob pattern . To ingest all objects in the bucket,
use ** as the glob pattern. If set, only objects that
match the given pattern are ingested.
For more information, see Match a glob pattern .
Retain the other default settings.
Click Create topic .
gcloud
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Run the gcloud pubsub topics create command:
gcloud pubsub topics create TOPIC_ID \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-bucket = BUCKET_NAME \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-input-format = INPUT_FORMAT \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-text-delimiter = TEXT_DELIMITER \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-minimum-object-create-time = MINIMUM_OBJECT_CREATE_TIME \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-match-glob = MATCH_GLOB
In the command, only TOPIC_ID , the
--cloud-storage-ingestion-bucket flag,
and the --cloud-storage-ingestion-input-format
flag are required. The remaining flags are optional
and can be omitted.
Replace the following:
TOPIC_ID : The name or ID of your topic.
BUCKET_NAME : Specifies the name of an existing bucket.
For example, prod_bucket .
The bucket name must not include the project ID.
To create a bucket, see Create buckets .
INPUT_FORMAT : Specifies the format of the objects that is ingested.
This can be text , avro , or pubsub_avro .
For more information about these options, see Input format .
TEXT_DELIMITER : Specifies the delimiter with which to split
text objects into Pub/Sub messages.
This should be a single character and should only be set when
INPUT_FORMAT is text .
It defaults to the newline character ( \n ).
When using gcloud CLI to specify the delimiter, pay close attention
to the handling of special characters like newline \n .
Use the format '\n' to ensure the delimiter is correctly interpreted.
Simply using \n without quotes or escaping results in a
delimiter of "n" .
MINIMUM_OBJECT_CREATE_TIME : Specifies the minimum time
at which an object was created in order for it to be ingested.
This should be in UTC in the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ .
For example, 2024-10-14T08:30:30Z .
Any date, past or future, from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to
9999-12-31T23:59:59Z inclusive, is valid.
MATCH_GLOB : Specifies the glob pattern to match in
order for an object to be ingested. When you are using gcloud CLI,
a match glob with * characters must have the *
character formatted as escaped in the form \*\*.txt
or the whole match glob must be in quotes
"**.txt" or '**.txt' .
For information about supported syntax for glob patterns, see
the Cloud Storage documentation .

Edit a Cloud Storage import topic
You can edit a Cloud Storage import topic to update its properties.
For example, to restart ingestion, you can change the bucket or update the
minimum object creation time .
To edit a Cloud Storage import topic, perform the following steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Topics page.
Go to Topics
Click the Cloud Storage import topic.
In the topic details page, click Edit .
Update the fields that you want to change.
Click Update .
gcloud
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
To avoid losing your settings for the import topic, make sure to
include all of them every time you update the topic. If you leave something
out, Pub/Sub resets the setting to its original default value.
Run the gcloud pubsub
topics update command with all the flags mentioned in the following
sample:
gcloud pubsub topics update TOPIC_ID \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-bucket = BUCKET_NAME \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-input-format = INPUT_FORMAT \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-text-delimiter = TEXT_DELIMITER \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-minimum-object-create-time = MINIMUM_OBJECT_CREATE_TIME \
--cloud-storage-ingestion-match-glob = MATCH_GLOB
Replace the following:
TOPIC_ID is the topic ID or name. This field cannot be updated.
BUCKET_NAME : Specifies the name of an existing bucket.
For example, prod_bucket .
The bucket name must not include the project ID.
To create a bucket, see Create buckets .
INPUT_FORMAT : Specifies the format of the objects that is ingested.
This can be text , avro , or pubsub_avro .
See
Input format for more information on these options.
TEXT_DELIMITER : Specifies the delimiter with which to split
text objects into Pub/Sub messages.
This should be a single character and should only be set when
INPUT_FORMAT is text .
It defaults to the newline character ( \n ).
When using gcloud CLI to specify the delimiter, pay close attention
to the handling of special characters like newline \n . Use the
format '\n' to ensure the delimiter is correctly interpreted.
Simply using \n without quotes or escaping results in a
delimiter of "n" .
MINIMUM_OBJECT_CREATE_TIME : Specifies the minimum time
at which an object was created in order for it to be ingested.
This should be in UTC in the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ .
For example, 2024-10-14T08:30:30Z .
Any date, past or future, from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to
9999-12-31T23:59:59Z inclusive, is valid.
MATCH_GLOB : Specifies the glob pattern to match in
order for an object to be ingested. When you are using gcloud CLI,
a match glob with * characters must have the *
character formatted as escaped in the form \*\*.txt
or the whole match glob must be in quotes
"**.txt" or '**.txt' .
For information about supported syntax for glob patterns, see
the
Cloud Storage documentation .
Quotas and limits for Cloud Storage import topics
The publisher throughput for import topics is bound by the publish quota
of the topic. For more information, see
Pub/Sub quotas and limits .
