BigQuery subscriptions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides an overview of a BigQuery subscription,
its workflow, and associated properties.
A BigQuery subscription is a type of export subscription
that writes messages to an existing BigQuery table as
they are received. You don't need to configure a separate subscriber client.
Use the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, the client libraries, or
the Pub/Sub API to create, update, list, detach, or delete a
BigQuery subscription.
Key Point: Understand the workflow for a BigQuery subscription and
read about the permissions, properties, quotas, and pricing related to
the subscription.
Without the BigQuery subscription type,
you need a pull or push subscription and a subscriber
(such as Dataflow) that reads messages and writes them to
a BigQuery table. The overhead of running a
Dataflow job is not necessary when messages don't require
additional processing before storing them in a BigQuery table;
you can use a BigQuery subscription instead.
For lightweight modifications on messages, you can attach a
Single Message Transform to your
BigQuery subscription. However, a Dataflow
pipeline is recommended for Pub/Sub systems where more complex
data transformation is required before the data is stored in a
BigQuery table, especially if you want to window or aggregate
across messages.
To learn how to stream data from Pub/Sub to
BigQuery with transformation by using Dataflow,
see Stream from Pub/Sub to
BigQuery .
The Pub/Sub subscription to BigQuery template from Dataflow enforces exactly once delivery by
default. This is typically achieved through deduplication mechanisms within
the Dataflow pipeline. However, the BigQuery
subscription only supports at least once delivery. If exact deduplication is
critical for your use case, consider downstream processes in
BigQuery to handle potential duplicates.
Before you begin
Before reading this document, ensure that you're familiar with the following:
How Pub/Sub works and the different
Pub/Sub terms.
The different kinds of subscriptions
that Pub/Sub supports and why you might want to use a
BigQuery subscription.
How BigQuery works and how to configure
and manage BigQuery tables.
BigQuery subscription workflow
The following image shows the workflow between a BigQuery
subscription and BigQuery.
Figure 1. Workflow for a BigQuery subscription
Here is a brief description of the workflow that references Figure 1:
Pub/Sub uses the
BigQuery Storage Write API to send data to the
BigQuery table.
The messages are sent in batches to the BigQuery table.
After a successful completion of a write operation, the API returns an OK
response.
If there are any failures in the write operation, the
Pub/Sub message itself is negatively acknowledged. The
message is then re-sent. If the message fails enough times and there's a
dead letter topic configured on the subscription, then the message is moved
to the dead letter topic.
Properties of a BigQuery subscription
The properties that you configure for a BigQuery subscription
determine the BigQuery table to which Pub/Sub
writes messages and the type of schema of that table.
For more information, see
BigQuery properties .
Schema compatibility
This section is only applicable if you select the
option Use topic schema
when you create a BigQuery subscription.
Pub/Sub and BigQuery use different ways to
define their schemas. Pub/Sub schemas are defined in Apache
Avro or Protocol Buffer format while
BigQuery schemas are defined using a
variety of formats .
The following is a list of
important information regarding the schema compatibility between a
Pub/Sub topic and a BigQuery table.
Any message that contains an improperly formatted field is not written to
BigQuery.
In the BigQuery schema, INT , SMALLINT , INTEGER ,
BIGINT , TINYINT , and BYTEINT are aliases for INTEGER ; DECIMAL is an
alias for NUMERIC ; and BIGDECIMAL is an alias for BIGNUMERIC .
When the type in the topic schema is a string and the type in the
BigQuery table is JSON , TIMESTAMP , DATETIME , DATE ,
TIME , NUMERIC , or BIGNUMERIC , then any value for this field in a
Pub/Sub message must adhere to the format specified for the
BigQuery data
type .
Some Avro logical types are supported, as specified in the following table.
Any logical types not listed only match the equivalent Avro type that they
annotate, as detailed in the Avro specification .
The following is a collection of mapping of different schema formats to
BigQuery data types.

Date and time integer representation
When mapping from an integer to one of the date or time types, the number must
represent the correct value. The following is the mapping from BigQuery data
types to the integer that represents them.
BigQuery Data Type
Integer Representation
DATE
The number of days since the Unix epoch, January 1, 1970
DATETIME
The date and time in microseconds expressed as civil time using the
CivilTimeEncoder
TIME
The time in microseconds expressed as civil time using the
CivilTimeEncoder
TIMESTAMP
The number of microseconds since the Unix epoch, January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC
BigQuery change data capture ingestion
BigQuery subscriptions support change data capture (CDC)
ingestion updates when
use_topic_schema or
use_table_schema
is set to true in the subscription properties. To use the feature with
use_topic_schema , set the schema of the topic with the
following fields:
_CHANGE_TYPE (required): A string field set to UPSERT or DELETE .
If a Pub/Sub message written to the
BigQuery table has _CHANGE_TYPE set to UPSERT ,
then BigQuery updates the row with the same key if
it exists or inserts a new row if it does not.
If a Pub/Sub message written to the
BigQuery table has _CHANGE_TYPE set to DELETE ,
then BigQuery deletes the row in the table with the
same key if it exists.
_CHANGE_SEQUENCE_NUMBER (optional): A string field set to ensure that
updates and deletes made to the BigQuery table are processed
in order. Messages for the same row key must contain a monotonically
increasing value for _CHANGE_SEQUENCE_NUMBER . Messages with sequence
numbers that are less than the highest sequence number processed for a row
don't have any effect on the row in the BigQuery table. The
sequence number must follow the
_CHANGE_SEQUENCE_NUMBER format .
To use the feature with use_table_schema , include the preceding fields in
the JSON message.
Note: When using BigQuery CDC ingestion, the
BigQuery table must have a primary key. For more information, see
BigQuery CDC ingestion prerequisites .
For information about pricing, see
BigQuery CDC ingestion pricing .
BigLake tables for Apache Iceberg in BigQuery
BigQuery subscriptions can be used with BigLake
tables for Apache Iceberg in BigQuery
with no additional changes required.
BigLake tables for Apache Iceberg in BigQuery provide the
foundation for building open-format lakehouses on Google Cloud. These tables
offer the same fully managed experience as standard (built-in)
BigQuery tables , but store data in
customer-owned storage buckets using Parquet to be interoperable with
Iceberg open table formats.
For information on how to create an BigLake tables for Apache Iceberg
in BigQuery , see Create an Iceberg
table .
Handle message failures
When a Pub/Sub message cannot be written to
BigQuery, the message cannot be acknowledged. To forward such
undeliverable messages, configure a dead-letter
topic on the
BigQuery subscription. The Pub/Sub message
forwarded to the dead-letter topic contains an attribute
CloudPubSubDeadLetterSourceDeliveryErrorMessage that has the reason that the
Pub/Sub message couldn't be written to
BigQuery.
If Pub/Sub cannot write messages to BigQuery,
then Pub/Sub backs off delivery of messages in a way similar to
push backoff behavior . However, if the
subscription has a
dead-letter topic attached
to it, Pub/Sub does not back off delivery when message failures
are due to schema compatibility errors.
Quotas and limits
There are quota limitations on the BigQuery subscriber
throughput per region. For more information, see Pub/Sub quotas
and limits .
BigQuery subscriptions write data by using the
BigQuery Storage Write API . For information about the
quotas and limits for the Storage Write API, see
Storage Write API requests .
BigQuery subscriptions only consume the throughput quota for the Storage Write API. You
can ignore the other Storage Write API quota considerations in this instance.
Pricing
For the pricing for BigQuery subscriptions, see the
Pub/Sub pricing page .
