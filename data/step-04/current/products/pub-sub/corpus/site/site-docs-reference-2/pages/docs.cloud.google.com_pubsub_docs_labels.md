Reporting usage with labels
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Labels in Pub/Sub help you with cost management and resource
organization. For example, imagine you have multiple subscriptions for different
types of news updates. You can label each subscription with a relevant category,
such as news_category=sports or news_category=entertainment .
Note: Reporting usage with labels is not supported for fees related to
Pub/Sub data transfer costs. For cost management of data
transfer costs, consider using tags , which support
detailed usage cost data export .
What are labels?
A label is a key-value pair that you can assign to Google Cloud resources.
They help you organize these resources and manage your costs at scale, with the
granularity you need. You can attach a label to each resource, then filter the
resources based on their labels. Information about labels is forwarded to the billing system that
lets you break down your billed charges by label. With built-in billing reports ,
you can filter and group costs by resource labels.
You can also use labels to
query billing data exports .
Requirements for labels
The labels applied to a resource must meet the following
requirements:
Each resource can have up to 64 labels.
Each label must be a key-value pair.
Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 63
characters, and cannot be empty. Values can be empty, and have a maximum length
of 63 characters.
Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters,
underscores, and dashes. All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and
international characters are allowed. Keys must start with a lowercase letter or
international character.
The key portion of a label must be unique within a single resource.
However, you can use the same key with multiple resources.
These limits apply to the key and value for each label, and to the
individual Google Cloud resources that have labels. There
is no limit on how many labels you can apply across all resources
within a project.
Common uses of labels
Here are some common use cases for labels:
Team or cost center labels : Add labels based on team or
cost center to distinguish resources owned by different
teams (for example, team:research and team:analytics ). You can use this
type of label for cost accounting or budgeting.
Component labels : For example, component:redis ,
component:frontend , component:ingest , and component:dashboard .
Environment or stage labels : For example,
environment:production and environment:test .
State labels : For example, state:active ,
state:readytodelete , and state:archive .
Ownership labels : Used to identify the teams that are
responsible for operations, for example: team:shopping-cart .
Note: Don't include sensitive information in labels, including
personally identifiable information, such as an individual's name or title.
Labels are not designed to handle sensitive information.
We don't recommend creating large numbers of unique labels, such as
for timestamps or individual values for every API call.
The problem with this approach is that when the values change frequently or with
keys that clutter the catalog, this makes it difficult to effectively filter and
report on resources.
Labels and tags
Labels can be used as queryable annotations for resources, but can't be used
to set conditions on policies. Tags provide a way to conditionally allow or
deny policies based on whether a resource has a specific tag, by providing fine-grained
control over policies. For more information, see the
Tags overview .
Managing labels in Pub/Sub
In Pub/Sub, labels are often used to organize
fees for a given billing account. Fees are associated with
the billing account of the project that contains the requested resource, but you
might want to establish additional associations. For example, a subscription
that belongs to one project might be created for a topic that belongs to a
different project. You can use labels to associate that topic
and subscription with a common cost center.
Note: While you can use labels to organize fees by billing account, no
additional fees are charged for the use of Pub/Sub labels.
Pub/Sub resources don't inherit labels from each other. In the
preceding example, you would set the same label on both the topic and the
subscription in order to associate those charges.
You can use the following features to apply labels to Pub/Sub
resources:
The Google Cloud console :
Select a resource and change to the LABELS tab.
Pub/Sub Client Libraries
(specifically Java
and Python ).
The Google Cloud CLI for Pub/Sub .
For example, see the create topic
command.
