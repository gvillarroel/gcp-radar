Choose Pub/Sub or Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document guides you in choosing between Pub/Sub and
Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka. Both Pub/Sub and
Managed Service for Apache Kafka are horizontally scalable, managed
messaging services capable of handling high-volume workloads.
This document is intended for developers, architects, or decision-makers who are
seeking a managed service for handling streaming data and messaging workloads.
Several options for running Apache Kafka exists, including partner services
and self-managed open source software. This document does not cover those options.
For an overview of Pub/Sub concepts, see
Overview of the Pub/Sub service .
For an overview of Managed Service for Apache Kafka concepts, see
Managed Service for Apache Kafka overview .
Operational ease versus portability
The choice between Pub/Sub and
Managed Service for Apache Kafka is a tradeoff between
operational simplicity and portability .
Operational simplicity of Pub/Sub
Pub/Sub is a wholly managed, serverless, and globally
distributed service that uses Google Cloud infrastructure. It automatically
scales to handle your workload, so you don't need to worry about managing
infrastructure. Pub/Sub dynamically adjusts capacity for
individual topics and subscriptions. Publishers and subscribers can scale
independently, not only across different topics and subscriptions, but also
within the same ones.
Pub/Sub also seamlessly moves data across multiple regions.
This means publishers and subscribers can
connect to their nearest region, and the service handles the rest.
Managed Service for Apache Kafka can also handle large volumes of data.
However, you must manage the cluster size and configure several other properties
based on the scaling needs of your topics. Most importantly, you must consider
the number of partitions to assign to your topics. Too many partitions can waste
resources. Too few partitions can overload the brokers in your Kafka cluster.
You must also consider the number of replicas that you have to configure per
partition depending on your latency and consumer fan-out requirements.
As a Kafka deployment is tied to a specified region, if you move data across
regions, that data movement must happen outside of the service. Ensuring the
continued health of the data movement and meeting the needs of the topics in
your Kafka cluster adds to your operational work.
Portability of Managed Service for Apache Kafka
While Pub/Sub's autoscaling and global data distribution make it
easier to operate, Apache Kafka APIs are much more broadly adopted.
If you plan to use independent messaging systems in different on-premises or
cloud-provider environments, Managed Service for Apache Kafka can give you
a more consistent experience across your applications. This is because you can
standardize on Kafka and use the same API to communicate with the Kafka service
in each environment.
While you can certainly use Pub/Sub as a central messaging
system across all your environments, it's important to remember that it is a
distinct service with its own API. If you need to interact with a messaging
system for a specific environment, using
Managed Service for Apache Kafka might offer a more unified development
experience.
Which service is right for you
If consistent experience across diverse environments is paramount, choose
Managed Service for Apache Kafka. If your focus is on minimal
configuration for scaling workloads or inter-region data movement,
Pub/Sub offers a compelling advantage.
Choose Pub/Sub if the following factors describe your
requirements:
You prioritize operational simplicity within Google Cloud.
You need a scalable and serverless solution with minimal overhead
management.
You have unpredictable or changing workload sizes. Pub/Sub
also works great when the workload throughput is stable.
You require per-message processing tracking to minimize pipeline effects due
to single bad messages. Pub/Sub, with its built-in
dead-letter queues (DLQs) and support for out-of-order message processing,
lets your system remain operational even when encountering problematic
messages.
You need inter-region data aggregation.
You need independent publisher and subscriber scaling.
Choose Managed Service for Apache Kafka if the following factors describe
your requirements:
Portability across multiple cloud providers or on-premises environments is
critical.
You have existing Kafka workloads that you want to migrate to
Google Cloud. For more information,
see Choose based on the existing Kafka setup .
You have consistent traffic volume without much variation.
You are willing to handle capacity management.
You require message ordering at high throughput per key.
You want to use the event sourcing pattern with an event log as a source of truth.
Choose based on the existing Kafka setup
If you're already using Kafka and seek a managed, secure, and reliable
solution on Google Cloud, Managed Service for Apache Kafka
is the recommended choice.
If you're already running Kafka and willing to
rewrite your applications to get the benefits of a highly
scalable, autoscaling, global service, Pub/Sub is a good
recommendation. To migrate from Kafka to Pub/Sub, see
Migrate from Kafka to Pub/Sub .
For new workloads or users new to streaming on Google Cloud,
Pub/Sub is recommended due to its ease of use. If you want to
move your existing Kafka workloads to the Cloud with minimal code changes,
Managed Service for Apache Kafka is the ideal choice.
Integration with Cloud products
Both Google Managed Service for Apache Kafka and Pub/Sub
integrates with various Google Cloud services like Dataflow,
BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and more.
If you need a multi-cloud strategy and prioritize portability across different
cloud providers, Managed Service for Apache Kafka offers greater
flexibility. This is because Kafka integrates with a wider range of
systems outside of Google Cloud as compared to Pub/Sub.
Feature comparison
If these high level decision criteria in the previous sections don't help,
you can make a choice based on specific feature support. For a detailed
