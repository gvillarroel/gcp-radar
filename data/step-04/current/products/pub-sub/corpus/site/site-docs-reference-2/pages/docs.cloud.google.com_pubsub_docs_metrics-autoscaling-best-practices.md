Best practices for using Pub/Sub metrics as a scaling signal
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
If you use Pub/Sub metrics as a signal to autoscale your pipeline, here
are some recommendations.
Use more than one signal to autoscale your pipeline
Don't use only Pub/Sub metrics to autoscale your pipeline. It
might lead to scenarios where you have a single point of failure for your
autoscaling decisions. Instead, use a combination of signals to trigger
autoscaling. An example of an additional signal is the client's CPU
utilization level. This signal can indicate whether the client tasks are
handling work and if scaling up can let the client tasks handle more work.
Some examples of signals from other
Cloud products that you can use for your pipeline are as follows:
Compute Engine supports autoscaling based on signals such as
CPU utilization and Monitoring metrics.
Compute Engine also supports multiple metrics and multiple signals
for better reliability.
For more information about scaling with Monitoring metrics, see
Scale based on Monitoring metrics .
For more information about scaling with CPU utilization, see Scale based on CPU utilization .
Google Kubernetes Engine Horizontal Pod autoscaling (HPA) supports
autoscaling based on resource usage such as CPU and memory usage,
custom Kubernetes metrics, and external metrics such as
Monitoring metrics for Pub/Sub.
It also supports multiple signals.
For more information, see Horizontal Pod autoscaling .
Use the regional version of the metrics instead of global versions
Pub/Sub offers two versions of each metric typically used with
autoscaling. Make sure you use the versions with the by_region suffix:
subscription/num_unacked_messages_by_region
subscription/oldest_unacked_message_age_by_region
Don't use the global versions of these metrics if you want your autoscaling to
be resilient to single-region outages. The global version of these metrics
require the calculation of the backlog across all regions known to have
messages, which means unavailability in a single region region results in a data
gap. In contrast, the by_region versions of the metrics calculate and report
the backlog on a per-region basis. If the backlog cannot be computed for a
single region, the metric still reports values for the other regions.
Avoid using subscriber-side throughput metrics to autoscale subscribers
Avoid using subscriber-side throughput metrics like
subscription/ack_message_count to autoscale subscriber clients. Instead,
consider using metrics that directly reflect the backlog of messages waiting
to be processed, such as the previously mentioned
subscription/num_unacked_messages or
subscription/oldest_unacked_message_age .
Issues with using subscriber-side throughput metrics for autoscaling
Using these metrics can cause problems because they represent the amount
of traffic between Pub/Sub and subscribers. Scaling based on such
metric can create a self-referential loop where a decrease in delivered or
acknowledged messages leads to scaling down of clients. For example, this
might occur if there is a temporary dip in traffic or there is an issue with
one of your subscribers.
If your clients scale down to zero or near-zero, all on-going subscribe traffic
can stop, and subscribers may not be able to process messages, even if new
messages arrive. This can result in significant ingestion lag and lead to an
unrecoverable state for your subscriber clients.
Deal with metrics gaps when they occur
Don't assume that the absence of metrics means that there are no messages to
process. For example, if in response to missing metrics, you scale down
processing tasks to zero, messages already in the backlog or that get published
during this time might not be consumed. This increases the end-to-end latency.
To minimize latency, set a minimum task count greater than zero so that you
are always prepared to handle published messages,
even if recent Pub/Sub metrics indicate an empty queue.
Both Compute Engine autoscalers and Google Kubernetes Engine HPAs are designed to
maintain the current replica count when metrics are unavailable. This provides a
safety net if no metrics are available.
You can also implement
Pub/Sub flow control mechanisms
to help prevent tasks from being overwhelmed if they are unintentionally
downscaled due to missing metrics.
