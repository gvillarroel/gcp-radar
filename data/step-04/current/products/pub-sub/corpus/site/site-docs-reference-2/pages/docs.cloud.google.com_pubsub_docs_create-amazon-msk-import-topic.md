Create a Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka import topic
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
An Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) import
topic lets you continuously ingest data from Amazon MSK as an
external source and into Pub/Sub. Then you can stream the data
into any of the destinations that Pub/Sub supports.
Note: Only Amazon MSK provisioned
clusters
can be imported into Pub/Sub. Your clusters also must be
public. Clusters behind private VPCs aren't supported.
This document shows you how to create and manage Amazon MSK
import topics. To create a standard topic, see Create a standard
topic .
For more information about import topics, see About import topics .
Before you begin
Know more about the Pub/Sub publish
process .
Configure the required roles and permissions to manage Amazon MSK
import topics including the following:
Add the Pub/Sub publisher role to the
Pub/Sub service account
Add the Pub/Sub service agent role to the Pub/Sub service account , if not already granted.
Add the service account user role to the service account
Set up workload identity federation so that
Google Cloud can access the external streaming service.
Required roles and permissions
To get the permissions that
you need to create and manage Amazon MSK import topics,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Pub/Sub Editor ( roles/pubsub.editor )
IAM role on your topic or project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to create and manage Amazon MSK import topics. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to create and manage Amazon MSK import topics:
Create an import topic:
pubsub.topics.create
Delete an import topic:
pubsub.topics.delete
Get an import topic:
pubsub.topics.get
List an import topic:
pubsub.topics.list
Publish to an import topic:
pubsub.topics.publish and pubsub.serviceAgent
Update an import topic:
pubsub.topics.update
Get the IAM policy for an import topic:
pubsub.topics.getIamPolicy
Configure the IAM policy for an import topic:
pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
You can configure access control at the project level and the
individual resource level.
Set up federated identity to access Amazon MSK
Workload Identity Federation lets Google Cloud services access workloads
running outside of Google Cloud. With identity federation, you don't need
to maintain or pass credentials to Google Cloud to access your resources
in other clouds. Instead, you can use the identities of the workloads themselves
to authenticate to Google Cloud and access resources.
Create a service account in Google Cloud
This is an optional step. If you already have a service account, you can use
it in this procedure instead of creating a new service account.
If you are using an existing service account, go to
Record the service account unique ID for the
next step.
For Amazon MSK import topics, Pub/Sub uses the
service account as the identity to access resources from AWS.
For more information about creating a service account, including prerequisites,
required roles and permissions, and naming guidelines, see
Create service accounts . After you create
a service account, you might need to wait for 60 seconds or more before you
use the service account. This behavior occurs because read operations are
eventually consistent; it can take time for the new service account to
become visible.
Record the service account unique ID
You need a service account unique ID to set up a role in the AWS console.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service account details page.
Go to service account
Click the service account that you just created or the one that you are
planning to use.
From the Service account details page, record the Unique ID number.
You need the ID as part of the workflow to set up a role in the AWS console .
Add the service account token creator role to the Pub/Sub service account
Note: Pub/Sub creates and maintains a service account for each
project. The service account has the following format:
service-{PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com . Perform this procedure only if the
Pub/Sub service account does not have the Pub/Sub
Service Agent role ( roles/pubsub.serviceAgent ).
The Service account token creator role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator )
lets principals create short-lived credentials
for a service account. These tokens or credentials are used to impersonate
the service account.
For more information about service account impersonation, see
Service account impersonation .
You can also add the Pub/Sub publisher role ( roles/pubsub.publisher )
during this procedure. For more information about the role and why you are adding it,
see Add the Pub/Sub publisher role to the Pub/Sub service account .
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Click the Include Google-provided role grants checkbox.
Look for the service account that has the format service-{PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
For this service account, click the Edit Principal button.
If required, click Add another role .
Search and click the Service account token creator role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ).
Click Save .
Create a policy in AWS
You need a policy in AWS to let Pub/Sub authenticate to AWS so
that Pub/Sub can ingest data from Amazon MSK.
For more methods and information about how to create a policy in AWS, see
Creating IAM policies .
To create a policy in AWS, perform the following steps:
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the
IAM console .
In the navigation pane of the console for IAM ,
click Access Management > Policies .
Click Create policy .
For Click a service , click MSK .
For Action allowed, click Read > GetBootstrapBrokers .
This action grants permission to get the bootstrap brokers that Pub/Sub
uses to connect to the MSK cluster.
Click Add more permissions .
For Select a service , click Apache Kafka APIs for MSK .
For Action allowed , select the following:
List > DescribeTopic
This action grants permission to allow the Pub/Sub ingestion
topic to get details about the Amazon MSK Kafka topic.
Read > ReadData
This action grants permission to read data from the Amazon MSK Kafka topic.
Write > Connect
This action grants permission to connect and authenticate to the
Amazon MSK Kafka cluster.
For Resources , specify the cluster ARN (if you want
to restrict the policy to specific clusters, which is recommended).
Click Add more permissions .
For Select a service , click STS .
For Action allowed , click Write > AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity .
This action grants permission to obtain a set of temporary security
credentials for Pub/Sub to authenticate to Amazon MSK
by using identity federation.
Click Next .
Enter a policy name and description.
Click Create policy .
Create a role in AWS using a custom trust policy
You must create a role in AWS so that Pub/Sub can authenticate
to AWS to ingest data from Amazon MSK.
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console .
In the navigation pane of the console for IAM , click Roles .
Click Create role .
For Select trusted entity , click Custom trust policy .
In the Custom trust policy section, enter or paste the following:
{
"Version" : "2012-10-17" ,
"Statement" : [
{
"Effect" : "Allow" ,
"Principal" : {
"Federated" : "accounts.google.com"
},
"Action" : "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity" ,
"Condition" : {
"StringEquals" : {
"accounts.google.com:sub" : "<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_ID>"
}
}
}
]
}
Replace <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_ID> with the unique ID of
the service account that you recorded in
Record the service account unique ID .
Click Next .
For Add permissions , search and click the custom policy that
you just created.
Click Next .
Enter a role name and description.
Click Create role .
Add the Pub/Sub publisher role to the Pub/Sub principal
To enable publishing, you must assign a publisher role to the
Pub/Sub service account so that Pub/Sub is able to
publish to the Amazon MSK import topic.
Add the Pub/Sub service agent role to the Pub/Sub service account
Note: The Pub/Sub service agent role is granted by default for all projects after April 9, 2021. If your project has been created after this date and the Pub/Sub service agent role has not been removed, your Pub/Sub service account will already have this role.
To allow Pub/Sub to use your import topic project's publish quota, the Pub/Sub service agent requires the serviceusage.services.use permission on your import topic's project.
To provide this permission, we recommend you add the Pub/Sub service agent role to the Pub/Sub service account.
If the Pub/Sub service account does not have the Pub/Sub service agent role, it can be granted as follows:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Click the Include Google-provided role grants checkbox.
Look for the service account that has the format
service-{PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
For this service account, click the Edit principal button.
If required, click Add another role .
Search and click the Pub/Sub Service Agent role ( roles/pubsub.serviceAgent ).
Click Save .
Enable publishing from all topics
Use this method if you have not created any Amazon MSK import
topics.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Click the Include Google-provided role grants checkbox.
Look for the service account that has the format
service-{PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
For this service account, click the Edit principal button.
If required, click Add another role .
Search and click the Pub/Sub publisher role ( roles/pubsub.publisher ).
Click Save .
Enable publishing from a single topic
Use this method only if the Amazon MSK import topic already exists.
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Run the gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding command:
gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding TOPIC_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/pubsub.publisher"
Replace the following:
TOPIC_ID : the topic ID of the Amazon MSK import topic.
PROJECT_NUMBER : the project number. To view the project
number, see Identifying projects .
Add the service account user role to the service account
The Service Account User role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) includes the
permission iam.serviceAccounts.actAs that lets a principal attach a service
account to the Amazon MSK import topic's ingestion settings and
use that service account for federated identity.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to IAM
For the principal that's issuing the create or update topic calls, click the
Edit principal button.
If required, click Add another role .
Search and click the Service account user role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ).
Click Save .
Use Amazon MSK import topics
You can create a new import topic or edit an existing topic.
Considerations
Caution: If you already have data in Amazon MSK, first create a
standard topic and a default subscription without enabling the ingestion
settings. Then, convert the topic to an import topic . This method ensures
that all messages are received by the subscription.
Creating the topic and subscription separately, even if done in rapid
succession, can lead to data loss. There's a short window where the topic
exists without a subscription. If any data is sent to the topic during this
time, it is lost. By creating the topic first, creating the subscription,
and then converting the topic to an import topic, you guarantee that no
messages are missed during the import process.
If you need to re-create the Kafka topic of an existing import topic with
the same name, you can't just delete the Kafka topic and re-create it.
This action can invalidate Pub/Sub's offset management, which can lead to
data loss. To mitigate this, follow these steps:
Delete the Pub/Sub import topic.
Delete the Kafka topic.
Create the Kafka topic.
Create the Pub/Sub import topic.
Data from an Amazon MSK Kafka topic is always read from the earliest
offset .
Create Amazon MSK import topics
To know more about properties associated with a topic, see Properties of a
topic .
Ensure that you have completed the following procedures:
Set up federated identity to access Amazon MSK
Add the Pub/Sub publisher role to the Pub/Sub
service account
Add the service account user role to the service account
To create an Amazon MSK import topic, follow these steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Topics page.
Go to Topics
Click Create topic .
In the Topic ID field, enter an ID for your Amazon MSK
import topic. For more information about naming topics, see the naming
guidelines .
Select Add a default subscription .
Select Enable ingestion .
For ingestion source, select Amazon MSK .
Enter the following details:
Cluster ARN : The ARN of the Amazon MSK that you are ingesting
into Pub/Sub. The ARN format is as follows: arn:aws:kafka:${Region}:${Account}:cluster/${ClusterName}/${ClusterId} .
Topic : The name of the Amazon MSK Kafka topic
that you are ingesting into Pub/Sub.
AWS Role ARN : The ARN of the AWS role. The ARN format of the role is
as follows: arn:aws:iam::${Account}:role/${RoleName} .
Service account : The service account that you created in Create a
service account in Google Cloud .
Click Create topic .
gcloud
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Run the gcloud pubsub topics create command:
gcloud pubsub topics create TOPIC_ID \
--aws-msk-ingestion-cluster-arn MSK_CLUSTER_ARN \
--aws-msk-ingestion-topic MSK_TOPIC \
--aws-msk-ingestion-aws-role-arn MSK_ROLE_ARN \
--aws-msk-ingestion-service-account PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
Replace the following:
TOPIC_ID : the name or ID of your Pub/Sub
topic.
MSK_CLUSTER_ARN : the ARN for the Amazon MSK
cluster that you are ingesting into Pub/Sub. The ARN format
is as follows:
arn:aws:kafka:${Region}:${Account}:cluster/${ClusterName}/${ClusterId} .
MSK_TOPIC : the name of the Amazon MSK
Kafka topic that you are ingesting into Pub/Sub.
MSK_ROLE_ARN : the ARN of the AWS role. The ARN
format of the role is as follows: arn:aws:iam::${Account}:role/${RoleName} .
PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT : the service account that
you created in Create a service account in Google Cloud .
