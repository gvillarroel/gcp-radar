Access control with Identity and Access Management
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the access control options available to you in Pub/Sub.
Overview
Pub/Sub uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access
control.
IAM allows you to grant specific roles to users, groups,
and service accounts, giving them the necessary permissions to perform their
tasks. You can grant these IAM roles using the
Google Cloud console or the IAM API.
In Pub/Sub, access control can be configured at the project
level and at the individual resource level. Here are some examples for
using Pub/Sub access control:
Grant access on a per-resource basis, rather than for the whole Cloud project.
Grant access with limited capabilities, such as to only publish messages to a
topic, or to only consume messages from a subscription, but not to delete the
topic or subscription.
Grant access to all Pub/Sub resources within a project to a
group of developers.
If you have view-only access to a single resource such as a topic or a
subscription, you cannot view the resource using the Google Cloud console.
Instead, you can use Google Cloud CLI to view the resource.
For a detailed description of IAM and its features, see the
IAM documentation . In particular, see
Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources .
Note: Pub/Sub is not associated with any specific IP address.
This is relevant if you rely on IP-based firewall rules.
Types of roles in Pub/Sub
Similar to other Google Cloud products, Pub/Sub supports
three types of roles:
Basic roles : Basic roles are highly permissive roles that existed prior
to the introduction of IAM. For more information about
basic roles, see Basic roles .
Predefined roles : Predefined roles give granular access to specific
Google Cloud resources. For more information about
predefined roles, see Predefined roles .
The Pub/Sub predefined roles are included in a
later part of this section.
Custom roles : Custom roles help you enforce the principle of least
privilege. For more information about custom roles, see
Custom roles .

Controlling access through the Google Cloud console
You can use the Google Cloud console to manage access control for your topics
and projects.
To set access controls at the project level, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go
to IAM
Select your project.
Click person_add Add .
Type in one or more principal names.
In the Select a role list, select the role you want to grant.
Click Save .
Verify that the principal is listed with the role that you granted.
To set access controls for topics and subscriptions, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Pub/Sub Topics list.
Go
to Topics
If needed, select your Pub/Sub-enabled project.
Perform one of the following steps:
To set roles for one or more topics, select the topics.
To set roles for a subscription attached to a topic, click the topic
ID. In the Topic details page, click the subscription ID. The
Subscription details page appears.
If the info panel is hidden, click Show info panel .
In the Permissions tab, click
person_add Add principal .
Type in one or more principal names.
In the Select a role list, select the role you want to grant.
Click Save .
Controlling access through the IAM API
The Pub/Sub IAM API lets you set and get policies on
individual topics and subscriptions in a project, and test a user's permissions
for a given resource. As with the regular Pub/Sub methods, you
can invoke the IAM API methods through the client libraries, or the API
Explorer, or directly over HTTP.
Note that you cannot use the Pub/Sub IAM API to
manage policies at the Google Cloud project level.
The following sections give examples for how to set and get a policy, and how to
test what permissions a caller has for a given resource.
Get a policy
The getIamPolicy() method allows you to get an existing policy .
This method returns a JSON object containing the policy associated with the
resource.
Here is some sample code to get a policy for a subscription :
C#
Before trying this sample, follow the C# setup instructions in
Quickstart: Using Client Libraries .
For more information, see the Pub/Sub C# API reference documentation .

Policy policy = publisher . IAMPolicyClient . GetIamPolicy ( new GetIamPolicyRequest
{
ResourceAsResourceName = subscriptionName
});
return policy ;
}
}
gcloud
Get the subscription policy:
gcloud pubsub subscriptions get-iam-policy \
projects/ ${ PROJECT } /subscriptions/ ${ SUBSCRIPTION } \
--format json

Set a policy
The setIamPolicy() method lets you attach a policy
to a resource. The setIamPolicy() method takes a SetIamPolicyRequest , which
contains the policy to be set and the resource to which the policy is attached.
It returns the resulting policy.
Here is some sample code to set a policy for a subscription :

UIs and command-line tools, not authorization. This operation
might fail open without warning.

Cross-project communication
Pub/Sub IAM is useful for fine-tuning access in
cross-project communication.
Suppose a service account in Cloud Project A wants to publish messages to a
topic in Cloud Project B. First, enable the Pub/Sub API
in Project A.
Second, grant the service account Edit permission in
Cloud Project B. However, this approach is often too coarse. You can use the
IAM API to achieve a more fine-grained level of access.
For example, this snippet uses the setIamPolicy() method in project-b and a prepared
topic_policy.json file to grant the service account
foobar@ project-a .iam.gserviceaccount.com of project-a the publisher role on the topic
projects/ project-b /topics/ topic-b :
gcloud pubsub topics set-iam-policy \
projects/ project-b /topics/ topic-b \
topic_policy.json
Output:
Updated IAM policy for topic topic-b .
bindings:
- members:
- serviceAccount:foobar@ project-a .iam.gserviceaccount.com
role: roles/pubsub.publisher
etag: BwWGrQYX6R4=
Partial availability behavior
Authorization checks depend on the IAM subsystem. In order to
offer consistently low response latency for data operations (publishing and
message consumption), the system may fall back on cached IAM
policies. For information about when your changes will take effect, see the
IAM documentation .
