Client (
subscriber_options : typing . Union [
google . cloud . pubsub_v1 . types . SubscriberOptions , typing . Sequence
] = (),
** kwargs : typing . Any
)
A subscriber client for Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
This creates an object that is capable of subscribing to messages.
Generally, you can instantiate this client with no arguments, and you
get sensible defaults.
Properties
api
The underlying gapic API client.
.. versionchanged:: 2.10.0
Instead of a GAPIC SubscriberClient client instance, this property is a
proxy object to it with the same interface.
deprecated:
Use the GAPIC methods and properties on the client instance directly
instead of through the api attribute.
api_endpoint
Return the API endpoint used by the client instance.
Returns
Type
Description
str
The API endpoint used by the client instance.
closed
Return whether the client has been closed and cannot be used anymore.
.. versionadded:: 2.8.0
open_telemetry_enabled
Returns True if Open Telemetry is enabled. False otherwise.
target
Return the target (where the API is).
transport
Returns the transport used by the client instance.
Returns
Type
Description
SubscriberTransport
The transport used by the client instance.
universe_domain
Return the universe domain used by the client instance.
Returns
Type
Description
str
The universe domain used by the client instance.
Methods
Client
Client (
subscriber_options : typing . Union [
google . cloud . pubsub_v1 . types . SubscriberOptions , typing . Sequence
] = (),
** kwargs : typing . Any
)
Instantiates the subscriber client.
Parameters
Name
Description
credentials
Optional[google.auth.credentials.Credentials]
The authorization credentials to attach to requests. These credentials identify the application to the service; if none are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the credentials from the environment.
transport
Optional[Union[str,SubscriberTransport,Callable[..., SubscriberTransport]]]
The transport to use, or a Callable that constructs and returns a new transport. If a Callable is given, it will be called with the same set of initialization arguments as used in the SubscriberTransport constructor. If set to None, a transport is chosen automatically.
client_options
Optional[Union[google.api_core.client_options.ClientOptions, dict]]
Custom options for the client. 1. The api_endpoint property can be used to override the default endpoint provided by the client when transport is not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and transport was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment variable, which have one of the following values: "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is the default value). 2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable is "true", then the client_cert_source property can be used to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not set, no client certificate will be used. 3. The universe_domain property can be used to override the default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that the api_endpoint property still takes precedence; and universe_domain is currently not supported for mTLS.
client_info
google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo
The client info used to send a user-agent string along with API requests. If None , then default info will be used. Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing your own client library.
Exceptions
Type
Description
google.auth.exceptions.MutualTLSChannelError
If mutual TLS transport creation failed for any reason.

) - > None
Acknowledges the messages associated with the ack_ids in the
AcknowledgeRequest . The Pub/Sub system can remove the
relevant messages from the subscription.
Acknowledging a message whose ack deadline has expired may
succeed, but such a message may be redelivered later.
Acknowledging a message more than once will not result in an
error.

Creates a snapshot from the requested subscription. Snapshots
are used in
Seek <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview> __
operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in
bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages
in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot.
If the snapshot already exists, returns ALREADY_EXISTS . If
the requested subscription doesn't exist, returns NOT_FOUND .
If the backlog in the subscription is too old -- and the
resulting snapshot would expire in less than 1 hour -- then
FAILED_PRECONDITION is returned. See also the
Snapshot.expire_time field. If the name is not provided in
the request, the server will assign a random name for this
snapshot on the same project as the subscription, conforming to
the resource name format .
The generated name is populated in the returned Snapshot object.
Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the
request.

Parameters
Name
Description
request
Union[google.pubsub_v1.types.Subscription, dict]
The request object. A subscription resource. If none of push_config , bigquery_config , or cloud_storage_config is set, then the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods. At most one of these fields may be set.
name
str
Required. Identifier. The name of the subscription. It must have the format "projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}" . {subscription} must start with a letter, and contain only letters ( [A-Za-z] ), numbers ( [0-9] ), dashes ( - ), underscores ( _ ), periods ( . ), tildes (
), plus ( <code>+</code><code>) or percent signs (</code><code>%</code><code>). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with </code>"goog"<code>. This corresponds to the </code>name<code> field on the </code>request<code> instance; if </code>request is provided, this should not be set.
topic
str
Required. The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving messages. Format is projects/{project}/topics/{topic} . The value of this field will be deleted-topic if the topic has been deleted. This corresponds to the topic field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set.
push_config
google.pubsub_v1.types.PushConfig
Optional. If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to configure it. This corresponds to the push_config field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set.
ack_deadline_seconds
int
Optional. The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be outstanding . During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call ModifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ack_id if using non-streaming pull or send the ack_id in a StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message. This corresponds to the ack_deadline_seconds field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set.
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry
Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
timeout
float
The timeout for this request.
metadata
Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]

Returns
Type
Description
google.pubsub_v1.types.Subscription
A subscription resource. If none of push_config, bigquery_config, or cloud_storage_config is set, then the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods. At most one of these fields may be set.

) - > None
Removes an existing snapshot. Snapshots are used in Seek
operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in
bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages
in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot.
When the snapshot is deleted, all messages retained in the
snapshot are immediately dropped. After a snapshot is deleted, a
new one may be created with the same name, but the new one has
no association with the old snapshot or its subscription, unless
the same subscription is specified.

by the subscriber, or to make the message available for
redelivery if the processing was interrupted. Note that this
does not modify the subscription-level ackDeadlineSeconds
used for subsequent messages.

Parameters
Name
Description
request
Union[google.pubsub_v1.types.ModifyAckDeadlineRequest, dict]
The request object. Request for the ModifyAckDeadline method.
subscription
str
Required. The name of the subscription. Format is projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub} . This corresponds to the subscription field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set.
ack_ids
MutableSequence[str]
Required. List of acknowledgment IDs. This corresponds to the ack_ids field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set.
ack_deadline_seconds
int
Required. The new ack deadline with respect to the time this request was sent to the Pub/Sub system. For example, if the value is 10, the new ack deadline will expire 10 seconds after the ModifyAckDeadline call was made. Specifying zero might immediately make the message available for delivery to another subscriber client. This typically results in an increase in the rate of message redeliveries (that is, duplicates). The minimum deadline you can specify is 0 seconds. The maximum deadline you can specify in a single request is 600 seconds (10 minutes). This corresponds to the ack_deadline_seconds field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set.
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry
Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
timeout
float
The timeout for this request.
metadata
Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]

]
] = _MethodDefault . _DEFAULT_VALUE ,
timeout : typing . Union [ float , object ] = _MethodDefault . _DEFAULT_VALUE ,
metadata : typing . Sequence [ typing . Tuple [ str , typing . Union [ str , bytes ]]] = ()
) - > None
Modifies the PushConfig for a specified subscription.
This may be used to change a push subscription to a pull one
(signified by an empty PushConfig ) or vice versa, or change
the endpoint URL and other attributes of a push subscription.
Messages will accumulate for delivery continuously through the
call regardless of changes to the PushConfig .

.policy_pb2.Policy
Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources. A Policy is a collection of bindings . A binding binds one or more members to a single role . Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions (defined by IAM or configured by users). A binding can optionally specify a condition , which is a logic expression that further constrains the role binding based on attributes about the request and/or target resource. **JSON Example** :: { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": ["user:eve@example.com"], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01t00:00:00.000z')",="" }="" }="" ]="" }="" **yaml="" example**="" ::="" bindings:="" -="" members:="" -="" user:mike@example.com="" -="" group:admins@example.com="" -="" domain:google.com="" -="" serviceaccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com="" role:="" roles/resourcemanager.organizationadmin="" -="" members:="" -="" user:eve@example.com="" role:="" roles/resourcemanager.organizationviewer="" condition:="" title:="" expirable="" access="" description:="" does="" not="" grant="" access="" after="" sep="" 2020="" expression:="" request.time="">< timestamp('2020-10-01t00:00:00.000z')="" for="" a="" description="" of="" iam="" and="" its="" features,="" see="" the=""> IAM developer's guide __.

Establishes a stream with the server, which sends messages down
to the client. The client streams acknowledgments and ack
deadline modifications back to the server. The server will close
the stream and return the status on any error. The server may
close the stream with status UNAVAILABLE to reassign
server-side resources, in which case, the client should
re-establish the stream. Flow control can be achieved by
configuring the underlying RPC channel.

Parameters
Name
Description
requests
Iterator[google.pubsub_v1.types.StreamingPullRequest]
The request object iterator. Request for the StreamingPull streaming RPC method. This request is used to establish the initial stream as well as to stream acknowledgments and ack deadline modifications from the client to the server.
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry
Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
timeout
float
The timeout for this request.
metadata
Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]
Key/value pairs which should be sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type str , but for metadata keys ending with the suffix -bin , the corresponding values must be of type bytes .
Returns
Type
Description
Iterable[google.pubsub_v1.types.StreamingPullResponse]
Response for the StreamingPull method. This response is used to stream messages from the server to the client.
subscribe
subscribe (
subscription : str ,
callback : typing . Callable [[ subscriber . message . Message ], typing . Any ],
flow_control : typing . Union [
google . cloud . pubsub_v1 . types . FlowControl , typing . Sequence
] = (),
scheduler : typing . Optional [ subscriber . scheduler . ThreadScheduler ] = None ,
use_legacy_flow_control : bool = False ,
await_callbacks_on_shutdown : bool = False ,
) - > google . cloud . pubsub_v1 . subscriber . futures . StreamingPullFuture
Asynchronously start receiving messages on a given subscription.
This method starts a background thread to begin pulling messages from
a Pub/Sub subscription and scheduling them to be processed using the
provided callback .
The callback will be called with an individual
xref_Message. It is the
responsibility of the callback to either call ack() or nack()
on the message when it finished processing. If an exception occurs in
the callback during processing, the exception is logged and the message
is nack() ed.
The flow_control argument can be used to control the rate of at
which messages are pulled. The settings are relatively conservative by
default to prevent "message hoarding" - a situation where the client
pulls a large number of messages but can not process them fast enough
leading it to "starve" other clients of messages. Increasing these
settings may lead to faster throughput for messages that do not take
a long time to process.
The use_legacy_flow_control argument disables enforcing flow control
settings at the Cloud Pub/Sub server, and only the client side flow control
will be enforced.
This method starts the receiver in the background and returns a
Future representing its execution. Waiting on the future (calling
result() ) will block forever or until a non-recoverable error
is encountered (such as loss of network connectivity). Cancelling the
future will signal the process to shutdown gracefully and exit.
Note:
properties that may be surprising. Please take a look at
https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pull#streamingpull for
more details on how streaming pull behaves compared to the
synchronous pull method.
Example:
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
subscriber_client = pubsub_v1. SubscriberClient ()
# existing subscription
subscription = subscriber_client .subscription_path(
'my-project-id', 'my-subscription')
def callback(message):
print(message)
message. ack ()
future = subscribe r_client. subscribe (
subscription, callback)
try:
future.result()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
future.cancel() # Trigger the shutdown.
future.result() # Block until the shutdown is complete.
Parameter
Name
Description
use_legacy_flow_control
bool
If set to True , flow control at the Cloud Pub/Sub server is disabled, though client-side flow control is still enabled. If set to False (default), both server-side and client-side flow control are enabled.

subscription_path ( project : str , subscription : str ) - > str
Returns a fully-qualified subscription string.
