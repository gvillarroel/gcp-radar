Applied Threat Intelligence Fusion Feed overview
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
The Applied Threat Intelligence (ATI) Fusion Feed is a collection of Indicators of Compromise
(IoCs), including hashes, IPs, domains, and URLs, that are associated with known
threat actors, malware strains, active campaigns, and finished intelligence reporting. The feed also includes IoCs from open-source feeds that Mandiant Intelligence has carefully checked and validated, which maximizes value and provides high accuracy.
Mandiant's curation process includes the following phases:
Frontline incident response: While investigating breaches, Mandiant analysts gain first-hand knowledge of
attacker tools and techniques.
Threat research: Dedicated teams track threat actors, analyze malware, and
uncover emerging attack infrastructure.
Contextualization: IoCs are mapped to specific threats and campaigns, which
helps in understanding and prioritizing incidents.
The Breach Analytics feed builds upon the ATI Fusion Feed by including indicators from new and active Mandiant breach investigations. It provides real-time insights into the latest attack trends. To enhance indicator matching, YARA-L rules can use contextual information from the ATI Fusion Feed, such as associated threat groups, an indicator's presence in compromised environments, or Mandiant's automated maliciousness score.
Write YARA-L rules with the ATI Fusion Feed
Writing YARA-L rules that use the ATI Fusion Feed in Google Security Operations follows a similar process to writing YARA-L rules that use other context entity sources. For more information, see Create context-aware analytics .
Note: If Data RBAC is enabled
in your system, select bind to scope to test your rule.
Events and match sections
To write a rule, follow these steps:
1. Filter the selected context entity graph. In this case, Fusion Feed .
1. Filter a specific indicator type. For example, FILE . See the following example:
events:
$context_graph.graph.metadata.product_name = "MANDIANT_FUSION_IOC"
$context_graph.graph.metadata.vendor_name = "MANDIANT_FUSION_IOC"
$context_graph.graph.metadata.source_type = "GLOBAL_CONTEXT"
$context_graph.graph.metadata.entity_type = "FILE"
You can add any other conditions of the event or context entity in the events section. You can join a field from the context entity and UDM event field.
In the following example, the placeholder variable ioc is used to do a transitive join between the context entity and the event. The ioc variable is then used in the match section to make sure there's a match in a specific timeframe.
$ioc = $context_graph.graph.entity.file.md5
$ioc = $e1.principal.process.file.md5
match:
$ioc over 1h
Note: The system doesn't use the MANDIANT_FUSION_IOC log source for automatic IOC matching. This source lets you use these IOCs within your rules.
For more information about context entity fields that can be used in YARA-L rules, see the Fusion Feed context entity fields section.
Outcome section
Continuing with the previous example, the basic indicator matching rule is set up
against file hashes in the context entities in the graph.entity.file.md5
field and principal.process.file.md5 UDM field.
Because this rule can match a large number of events, it is recommended that you refine the rule to match on context entities that have specific intelligence. For example, you may want to match on the confidence score that Mandiant assigned to the indicator, whether it was seen in a breached environment or the malware family associated with the indicator. This can all be done in the outcome section of the rule.
outcome:
// Extract the Mandiant Automated Intel confidence score of maliciousness
$confidence_score = max(if($context_graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict_info.source_provider = "Mandiant Automated Intel", $context_graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict_info.confidence_score, 0))
// Extract the status of the indicator as seen in a breached environment
$breached = max(if($context_graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict_info.pwn = true, 1, 0))
// Intermediary outcome variable to combine conditions of intelligence extracted in the previous outcome variables.
// Return 1 if conditions are met, otherwise return 0.
$matched_conditions = if($confidence_score >= 80 AND $breached = 1, 1, 0)
In the outcome section of the YARA-L rule, the confidence score is
extracted using an if statement wrapped in a max function. This technique is
required for multi-event rules. The same technique is used to extract the
pwn variable from verdict_info , which indicates whether an
indicator has been seen in a breached environment identified by Mandiant.
These two outcome variables are then combined together in another
matched_conditions variable, which allows the use of chained logic
in the condition section.
Condition section
The condition section ensures that e1 ,
context_graph , and matched_conditions exist and or
match the specified condition.
condition:
// Ensure $e1, $context_graph and $matched_conditions conditions are met.
$e1 AND $context_graph AND $matched_conditions = 1
Complete YARA-L rule
At this point the rule is ready for use and should look like the following:
rule fusion_feed_example_principal_process_file_md5 {
meta:
rule_name = "File Hash - Applied Threat Intelligence"
description = "Matches file hashes against the Applied Threat Intelligence Fusion Feed."
events:
// Filter graph
$context_graph.graph.metadata.product_name = "MANDIANT_FUSION_IOC"
$context_graph.graph.metadata.vendor_name = "MANDIANT_FUSION_IOC"
$context_graph.graph.metadata.entity_type = "FILE"
$context_graph.graph.metadata.source_type = "GLOBAL_CONTEXT"
// Do join
$ioc = $context_graph.graph.entity.file.md5
$ioc = $e1.principal.process.file.md5
match:
$ioc over 1h
outcome:
// Extract the Mandiant Automated Intel confidence score of maliciousness
$confidence_score = max(if($context_graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict_info.source_provider = "Mandiant Automated Intel", $context_graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict_info.confidence_score, 0))
// Extract the status of the indicator as seen in a breached environment
$breached = max(if($context_graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict_info.pwn = true, 1, 0))
// Intermediary outcome variable to combine conditions of intelligence extracted in the previous outcome variables.
// Return 1 if conditions are met, otherwise return 0.
$matched_conditions = if($confidence_score >= 80 AND $breached = 1, 1, 0)
condition:
// Ensure $e1, $context_graph and $matched_conditions conditions are met.
$e1 AND $context_graph AND $matched_conditions = 1
}
ATI Fusion Feed context entity fields
You can use many fields from the ATI Fusion Feed in rules. These fields
are all defined in the Unified Data Model field list .
The following fields are relevant for prioritizing indicators:
Entity field
Possible values
metadata.threat.associations.type
MALWARE , THREAT_ACTOR
metadata.threat.associations.name
Threat association name
metadata.threat.verdict_info.pwn
TRUE , FALSE
metadata.threat.verdict_info.pwn_first_tagged_time.seconds
Timestamp (seconds)
Some fields have key-value pairs that need to be used in combination to access
the correct values. For example:
Entity field 1
Values
Entity field 2
Values
metadata.threat.verdict_info.source_provider
Mandiant Global Intel
metadata.threat.verdict_info.global_hits_count
Integer
metadata.threat.verdict_info.source_provider
Mandiant Global Intel
metadata.threat.verdict_info.global_customer_count
Integer
metadata.threat.verdict_info.source_provider
Mandiant Analyst Intel
metadata.threat.verdict_info.confidence_score
Integer
metadata.threat.verdict_info.source_provider
Mandiant Automated Intel
metadata.threat.verdict_info.confidence_score
Integer
In the outcome section of a YARA-L rule, you can access a value designated
by a specific key using the following command:
$hit_count = max(if($context_graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict_info.source_provider = "Mandiant Global Intel", $context_graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict_info.global_hits_count, 0))
Examining entity matches in Google Security Operations helps you gain a comprehensive view of
the data, revealing additional fields that can be valuable in assessing the
priority and context of an indicator alert.

Complex conditions
To use multiple fields in a context entity, you can combine
multiple outcome variables to create more complex conditional logic. Intermediary outcome variables can be used to combine multiple fields. These variables are then combined to form a new outcome variable that can be used in the condition section.
For example:
// Value will be 1 if threat.associations.type = "MALWARE"
// Wrapper max function required for multi-event rules
$is_attributed_malware = max(if($entity_context.graph.metadata.threat.associations.type = "MALWARE", 1, 0))
// Value will be 1 if threat.associations.type = "THREAT_ACTOR"
$is_attributed_actor = max(if($entity_context.graph.metadata.threat.associations.type = "THREAT_ACTOR", 1,0))
// Value will be the sum of the $is_attributed_malware $is_attributed_malware and $is_attributed_actor
$is_attributed = if($is_attributed_malware = 1, 1, 0)
+
if($is_attributed_actor = 1, 1, 0)
// If the value of $is_attributed is greater than 1, this indicates the indicator has been attributed at least once with the type "MALWARE" or "THREAT_ACTOR"
In this example, two intermediary outcome variables, is_attributed_malware
and is_attributed_actor , are combined in an outcome variable
is_attributed .
The intermediary outcome values return numerical values, which
allows numerical comparisons in the new outcome variable.
The value in is_attributed will be 1 or greater if
the indicator has at least one threat association of type MALWARE
or THREAT_ACTOR .
Flexible joins in YARA-L rule
To reduce the number of rules required, you can use flexible joins between IoCs to connect multiple UDM fields to a context entity.
The following example shows the use of flexible joins for multiple UDM fields in the event section:
events:
// Filter graph
$mandiant.graph.metadata.product_name = "MANDIANT_FUSION_IOC"
$mandiant.graph.metadata.vendor_name = "MANDIANT_FUSION_IOC"
$mandiant.graph.metadata.entity_type = "FILE"
$mandiant.graph.metadata.source_type = "GLOBAL_CONTEXT"
$mandiant.graph.entity.file.md5 = strings.coalesce($e.target.process.file.md5, $e.target.process.file.md5) OR
$mandiant.graph.entity.file.md5 = strings.coalesce($e.principal.process.file.md5, $e.principal.process.file.md5)
