Dashboards overview
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
Caution: For all Google Security Operations instances provisioned after August 06, 2025,
you can no longer use Looker to create new dashboards
in Google SecOps SIEM or Google SecOps. Use Dashboards instead.
Use the Google Security Operations SIEM dashboards to view and analyze the
data in Google Security Operations SIEM, including security telemetry, ingestion metrics,
detections, alerts, and IoCs. These dashboards are based on the
capabilities of Looker .
Google Security Operations SIEM provides you with multiple default dashboards,
described in this document. You can also create custom dashboards .
Default dashboards
Click Dashboards & Reports > Dashboards to open the Dashboards page.
Default dashboards contain predefined visualizations of the data stored within
your Google Security Operations SIEM instance. These dashboards are designed for a specific use case, such as understanding the state of the Google Security Operations SIEM data ingestion system or monitoring the threat status in your enterprise.
Each default dashboard includes a time range filter that lets you view data
for a specific time period. This can be helpful when troubleshooting issues or
identifying trends. For example, you can use the filter to view data
for the past week or over a specific time range.
Note: Default dashboards can't be modified. You can make a copy of a default dashboard, and then modify the new dashboard to support a specific use case.
Google Security Operations SIEM provides the following default dashboards:
Main
Cloud Detection and Response
Context Aware Detections - Risk
Health Hub
Data Ingestion and Health
IoC Matches
Rule Detections
User Sign In Overview
Main dashboard
The Main dashboard displays information about the status of the
Google Security Operations SIEM data ingestion system. It also includes a global map
highlighting the geographic location of the IoCs detected within your enterprise.
You can view the following visualizations in the Main dashboard:
Ingested Events : the total number of events ingested.
Throughput : the volume of data that is ingested for a specific time.
Alerts : the total number of detections that have occurred over a period
of time. The number of alerts displayed on the Alerts & IoCs page may
differ, as this page shows only current alerts. For more
information, see View alerts .
Events Over Time : a column chart that displays the events that
occurred over a period of time.
Global Threat Map - IoC IP Matches : the location from which Indicator of Compromise (IoC)
matching events occurred.
Note: The mapping feature is unavailable in some regions of the world.
Cloud Detection and Response Overview dashboard
Note: The Cloud Detection and Response dashboard requires Security Command Center Premium.
The Cloud Detection and Response dashboard helps you monitor
the security status of your cloud environment and investigate potential threats.
The dashboard shows visualizations that help you understand the volume of data
sources, rule sets, alerts, and other information.
The Time filter lets you filter the data by time period.
The GCP Log Type filter lets you filter the data by Google Cloud log type.
You can view the following visualizations in the Cloud Detection and Response Overview dashboard:
CDIR Rulesets Enabled : displays the percentage of Google Security Operations SIEM rule sets enabled
for your cloud environment from the total rule sets provided by GCTI for Google Security Operations SIEM
users. GCTI provides multiple prepackaged curated rules. You can enable or disable
these rule sets.
GCP Data Sources Covered : displays the percentage of data sources covered, out of the total Google Cloud
data sources available. For example, if you can ingest data by using 40 log types
but you send data for only 20, the tile displays 50%.
CDIR alerts : displays the number of alerts raised from the rules within your GCTI rulesets
or Cloud threats. You can use the Time filter to set the number of days for which
this data is displayed.
Recent Alerts : displays recent alerts with their severity
and risk score. You can sort the table using the Event Timestamp Time column and
navigate to each alert for more information. It provides the number of aggregated
security findings enhanced by Security Command Center. These security findings are generated
by GCTI curated detection rule sets and categorized by finding type. You can use
the Time filter to set the number of days for which this data is displayed.
Alerts by Severity Over Time : displays the total alerts by severity,
trending over time. You can use the Time filter to set the number of days
for which this data is displayed.
Detection Coverage : provides information about Google Security Operations SIEM
rule sets and their status, total detections, and the date of the most recent detection.
You can use the Time filter to set the number of days for which this data is displayed.
Cloud Data Coverage : provides information about all available Google Cloud
services, parsers that cover each service, first seen event, last seen event,
and the total throughput.
For more information about CDIR rule sets, see Overview of Cloud Threats Category .
The table is followed by graphs of all Google Cloud services with their associated
data that show their ingestion trend over the following time intervals:
Last 24 hours
Last 30 days
Last six months
Context Aware Detections - Risk dashboard
The Context Aware Detections - Risk dashboard provides insight into the
current threat status of assets and users in your enterprise. It is built
using fields in the Rule Detections explore interface.
The severity and risk score values are variables defined in each rule. For an
example, see Outcome section syntax . In each panel, data
is sorted based on severity, and then risk score to identify users and
assets most at risk.
You can view the following visualizations in the Context Aware Detections - Risk dashboard:
Assets and Devices at Risk : lists the top 10 assets based on the severity
that you set the rule in the Meta > Severity . See
Meta section syntax .
The severity levels are Super High , Critical , High ,
Large , Medium , and Low . If the hostname value is not present in
the record, then it displays the IP address.
Users at Risk : lists the top 10 users based on severity. The
severity levels are Super High , Critical , High , Large , Medium ,
and Low . If the username value is not present in the record, then it
displays the email ID.
Aggregate Risk : for each date, displays the total aggregated risk score.
Detection Results : displays details about the detections returned by detection
engine rules. The table includes the rule name, detection ID, risk score, and severity.
Data Ingestion and Health dashboard
The Data Ingestion and Health dashboard provides information about the type,
volume, and health of data being ingested into your Google Security Operations SIEM tenant.
You can use this dashboard to monitor for anomalies in your environment. This dashboard provides visualizations that help you understand the volume of ingested logs, ingestion errors, and other relevant information.
Note: The data on the Data Ingestion and Health dashboard refreshes every 15 minutes. Wait up to 15 minutes to view the latest information. Note: To monitor the operational status and health of all of your data sources and parsers, go to the Health Hub . It includes information about failed and irregular sources and log types, and provides context to diagnose and remediate issues.
You can view the following visualizations in the Data Ingestion and Health dashboard:
The Global Time Filter configured on the dashboard applies to the following visualizations:
Ingested Events Count : displays the total number of ingested events.
Log Type Distribution by Throughput : displays the log types distribution based on the throughput.
Throughput : displays the ingestion throughput.
Log Type Distribution by Events Count : displays the log types distribution based on the number of events for each log type.
Ingestion Error Count : displays the total number of errors encountered during ingestion.
Ingestion - Events by Status : displays a table with events based on their status—sortable by column: Date , Ingested Logs , Normalized Events , Parsing Errors , Validation Errors , Indexing Errors .
Burst Limit Graph - Ingestion Rate : displays the log-ingestion hourly rate over time (see Burst limits ).
Burst Limit Graph - Quota Limit : displays the hourly log-ingestion quota over time (see Burst limits ).
Burst Rejection Graph : displays the hourly volume over time of logs that were rejected for exceeding the burst limit (see Burst limits ).
Ingestion - Events by Log Type : displays events based on log type—sortable by column: Log Type , Ingested Throughput , Ingested Logs , Normalized Events , Parsing Errors , Validation Errors , Indexing Errors .
Note: The Ingested Throughput and Ingested Logs columns display 0 values for UDM logs if there are only ENTITY_RISK_CHANGE events in the specified timeframe. This is because ENTITY_RISK_CHANGE events aren't counted in ingestion metrics, and they have no effect on billing.
Bindplane Agent Logging - Logs by Severity over Time : displays the number of logs by severity over time. The dashboard displays this visualization only when your Google SecOps ingests logs from a Bindplane agent.
Bindplane Agent Logging - Message Count : displays the number of logs by message text—sortable by column: Severity , Message , Total , First Seen , Last Seen . The dashboard displays this visualization only when your Google SecOps ingests logs from a Bindplane agent.
The timeframes for the following visualizations are preselected and aren't affected by the Global Time Filter :
Recently Ingested Events : displays recently ingested events for each log type.
Daily Log Information : displays the numbers of logs for a day for each log type.
Event Count (Last 24 Hours) and Event Size (Last 24 Hours) : display the event counts and the event sizes for the last 24 hours.
Event Count (Last 7 Days) and Event Size (Last 7 Days) : display the event counts and the event sizes for the last 7 days.

Number of Days Since Host Reported an Event (Last 7 Days) : displays the number of days since hosts reported an event (in the last 7 days).
IoC Matches dashboard
The IoC Matches dashboard provides visibility
into the IoCs present in your enterprise.
Note: The IoC Matches dashboard shows IoC details at the time of the IoC matching
(like confidence score and severity), whereas the IOC Matches tab of the Alerts & IoCs
page shows the UNIX seconds value for the day bucket in which the IoC match occurred.
You can view the following visualizations in the IoC Matches dashboard:
IoC Matches Over Time by Category : displays the number
of IoC matches based on their category.
Top 10 Domains IoC indicators : lists the top 10 domain
IoC indicators and their counts.
Top 10 IP IoC Indicators : lists the top 10 IP address IoC
indicators and their counts.
Top 10 Assets by IoC Matches : lists the top 10
assets by IoC matches, and their counts.
Top 10 IoC matches by Category, Type, and Count : lists the top 10
IoC matches by category, type, and their counts.
Top 10 IoC Values : lists the top 10 IoC values
along with the count.
Top 10 Rarely Seen Values : lists the top 10 rarely
occurring IoC matches and their counts.
The IoC Matches visualizations include the Event Timestamp Filter under
Filter-only fields .
Important: We recommend that you don't filter directly on Event Timestamp Filter .
Rule Detections dashboard
The Rule Detections dashboard provides insight into the detections returned
by detection engine rules. To receive detections, you must enable rules.

addresses which appeared in events that triggered detections.
User Sign In Overview dashboard
The User Sign in Overview dashboard provides insight into users
logging into your enterprise. This information can be useful for tracking
attempts by malicious actors to access your enterprise.
For example, you might find that a particular user has attempted to access your enterprise from a
country where you don't have an office or that an specific user appears to
repeatedly access an accounting application.
