Forwarder Management
Caution: The forwarder is deprecated . The forwarder component is being phased out of the Google SecOps platform and will reach end-of-life (EOL) in January 2027. Apr 1, 2026 : New Google SecOps customers cannot use the forwarder component. Jan 1, 2027 : The forwarder is officially EOL. No further patches, including security patches, will be released. Apr 1, 2027 : Data is no longer allowed to be ingested from the forwarder component.
Google recommends using Bindplane for Google SecOps as the primary solution for log collection. For more information, see Use Bindplane with Google SecOps .
You can use the Google Security Operations Forwarder Management API Methods to do the following programmatically:
Create and manage forwarders.
Create and manage collectors.
Get the file contents for a Google SecOps forwarder's configuration.( .conf ) and authentication ( _auth.conf ) files.
Note: Pre-existing forwarders can't be managed with this API and must be
re-created using the API to take advantage of the Forwarder Management API features.
Forwarders are composed of one or more collectors. Each collector's configuration
specifies its ingestion mechanism (for example, File, Kafka, PCAP, Splunk, or Syslog) and log type .
Assuming hardware requirements are met, you can use many collectors on the same
forwarder to ingest data from a variety of mechanisms and log types. For
example, you can install a forwarder with two syslog collectors listening for
PAN_FIREWALL and CISCO_ASA_FIREWALL data on separate ports, respectively.
The API lets you create forwarders and their collectors in your Google SecOps instance. Once a forwarder is created, you can use the Generate Forwarder Files endpoint to get the file contents (as JSON payload) for a forwarder's configuration ( .conf ) and authentication ( _auth.conf ) files. These contents can then be written to their respective .conf files for deployment with the Google SecOps
Forwarder service on a Windows or Linux system.
For Python samples that use the Forwarder Management API, see the GitHub repository .
Create a forwarder and its collector(s)
A forwarder must be created before any of its collectors can be created.
To create a forwarder and its collector(s):
Create a forwarder .
Create a collector for the forwarder.
(Optional) Repeat Step 2 to add more collectors.
Get API authentication credentials
Your Google Security Operations representative will provide you with a Google Developer
Service Account
Credential to enable the API client to communicate with the API.
You also must provide the Auth Scope when initializing your API client. OAuth 2.0 uses
a scope to limit an application's access to an account. When an application requests a scope,
the access token issued to the application is limited to the scope granted.
Use the following scope to initialize your Backstory API client:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chronicle-backstory
Python example
The following Python example demonstrates how to use the OAuth2 credentials
and HTTP client using google.oauth2 and googleapiclient .
# Imports required for the sample - Google Auth and API Client Library Imports.
# Get these packages from https://pypi.org/project/google-api-python-client/ or run $ pip
# install google-api-python-client from your terminal
from google.auth.transport import requests
from google.oauth2 import service_account
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chronicle-backstory']
# The apikeys-demo.json file contains the customer's OAuth 2 credentials.
# SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE is the full path to the apikeys-demo.json file
# ToDo: Replace this with the full path to your OAuth2 credentials
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = '/customer-keys/apikeys-demo.json'
# Create a credential using the Google Developer Service Account Credential and Backstory API
# Scope.
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)
# Build a requests Session Object to make authorized OAuth requests.
http_session = requests.AuthorizedSession(credentials)
# Your endpoint GET|POST|PATCH|etc. code will vary below
# Reference List example (for US region)
url = 'https://backstory.googleapis.com/v2/lists/COLDRIVER_SHA256'
# You might need another regional endpoint for your API call; see
# https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/ingestion-api#regional_endpoints
# requests GET example
response = http_session.request("GET", url)
# POST example uses json
body = {
"foo": "bar"
}
response = http_session.request("POST", url, json=body)
# PATCH example uses params and json
params = {
"foo": "bar"
}
response = http_session.request("PATCH", url, params=params, json=body)
# For more complete examples, see:
# https://github.com/chronicle/api-samples-python/
Backstory API query limits
The Backstory API enforces limits on the volume of requests that can be made by
any one customer against the Google SecOps platform. If you reach or exceed the
query limit, the Backstory API server returns HTTP 429 (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED) to
the caller. When developing applications for the Backstory API, Google
recommends that you enforce rate limits within your system to avoid resource
exhaustion. These limits apply to all of the Backstory APIs, including the
Search, Forwarder Management, and Tooling APIs.
See the detailed list of the Backstory API quotas .
The following limit for the Forwarder Management is being enforced
and is measured in queries per second (QPS):

the authentication ( _auth.conf ) file that is used by the forwarder to authenticate with
the Google SecOps instance.
Forwarder configuration fields
The following table lists the forwarder configuration settings that you can
specify using Create Forwarder and Update Forwarder. If you don't specify a value
for a setting when you use Create Forwarder, the setting's default value (shown
below) is applied.

Collector API Methods reference
This section describes the endpoints for working with collectors.
When creating and updating collectors, note that each collector configuration can specify ingestion settings for one, but not more than one, of the following:
Log file data
Kafka topics
Packet data (pcap)
Splunk data
Syslog data
Note: You must create a forwarder using Create Forwarder
before you can create one of its collectors using Create Collector.
For endpoints for working with forwarders, see the
Forwarder API reference .
Important: Although the authentication fields (username and password) for
Splunk and Kafka data collection are optional, data collection cannot succeed
without these values.
Create Collector
Creates a new collector in the Google SecOps account. Configuration
values for collectors must be specified using Create Collector after using
Create Forwarder.
For certain settings, configuration
values that are missing or zero-valued in the request body are set to default
values. For details about collector configuration fields and values, see
Collector configuration fields .
Note: The metadata and regex settings in a forwarder configuration are
global settings that apply to the forwarder and the forwarder's collectors.
These settings can be overridden on a per-collector basis.

Update Collector
When updating a collector with the API, you can choose to
overwrite the entire collector configuration or to overwrite only specific
fields of the collector configuration. It is usually best to overwrite specific
fields, so you avoid accidentally overwriting all of your data. To overwrite
specific fields, supply a FieldMask to your update request.
To supply a FieldMask to update the display name for a collector,
supply the updateMask URL query parameter in the patch request. For example:
?updateMask=displayName
The request body should only contain the fields that you wish to update (in
their exact locations).
Request
