Integrate ANY.RUN with Google SecOps
This document describes how to integrate ANY.RUN with
Google Security Operations (Google SecOps).
Important: This integration is no longer actively maintained.
For enhanced functionality, we strongly recommend that you transition to
the following dedicated Partner Integrations :
ANYRUN Sandbox
ANYRUN TI Feeds
ANYRUN TI Lookup
Product permission
Integration is working on API Key authentication. You can generate a new API Key
on the ANY.RUN page .
Integration parameters
For detailed instructions about how to configure an integration in
Google SecOps, see Configure
integrations .
Use the following parameters to configure the integration:
Parameter name
Type
Default value
Is mandatory
Description
Instance Name
String
N/A
No
Name of the Instance you intend to configure integration for.
Description
String
N/A
No
Description of the Instance.
Api Key
Password
N/A
Yes
Api Key to use with integration.
Run Remotely
Checkbox
Unchecked
No
Check the field in order to run the configured integration remotely. Once checked, the option appears to select the remote user (agent).
For instructions about how to configure an integration in
Google SecOps, see Configure
integrations .
You can make changes at a later stage, if needed. After you configure an
integration instance, you can use it in playbooks. For more information about
how to configure and support multiple instances, see Supporting
multiple instances .
Actions
For more information about actions, see
Respond to pending actions from Your Workdesk and Perform a
manual action .
Analyze File
Create ANY.RUN file analysis task.
This action doesn't run on Google SecOps entities. The full path
to the file for analysis should be provided as an action input parameter.
