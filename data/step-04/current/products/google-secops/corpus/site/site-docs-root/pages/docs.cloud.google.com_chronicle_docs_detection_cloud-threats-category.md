Cloud Threats category overview
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
This document provides an overview of the rule sets in the Cloud Threats category, the
required data sources, and configuration you can use to tune the alerts generated
by each rule set. These rule sets help identify threats in Google Cloud
environments using Google Cloud data and in AWS environments using AWS data.
Rule set descriptions
Important: Rule sets in the Cloud Threats category are available with
the Google Security Operations Enterprise license tier and Security Command Center Enterprise license tier.
The following rule sets are available in the Cloud Threats category.
Rule sets for Google Cloud data
Rule sets for AWS data
Rule sets for Azure data
Rule sets for Office 365 data
Rule sets for Okta data
The CDIR abbreviation stands for Cloud Detection, Investigation, and Response .

Gmail considered anomalous compared to a 30-day baseline.
Potential Workspace Account Compromise : Detects insider threat behaviors indicating
that the account could have been potentially compromised and may lead to privilege
escalation attempts or lateral movement attempts within a Google Workspace organization.
This would include behaviors considered rare or anomalous compared to a 30-day baseline.
Suspicious Workspace Administrative Actions : Detect behaviors indicating potential
evasion, security downgrading or rare and anomalous behaviors never seen in the
last 30 days from users with higher privileges, including administrators.

about setting up ingestion of AWS data.
For a list of all supported data sources,
see Supported default parsers .
The following sections describe the required data needed by rule sets that
identify patterns in data.
You can ingest AWS data using an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
bucket as a source type or, optionally, using Amazon S3 with Amazon Simple Queue
Service (Amazon SQS). At a high level, you will need to do the following:
Configure Amazon S3 or Amazon S3 with Amazon SQS to collect log data.
Configure a Google SecOps Feed
to ingest data from either Amazon S3 or Amazon SQS
See Ingest AWS logs into Google SecOps
for the detailed steps required to configure AWS services and configure a
Google SecOps Feed to ingest AWS data.
You can use AWS Managed Detection Testing test rules to verify that AWS data
is being ingested to Google SecOps SIEM. These test rules help verify whether AWS
log data is being ingested as expected. After setting up the ingestion of AWS
data, you perform actions in AWS that should trigger the test rules.
See Verify AWS data ingestion for Cloud Threats category
for information about how verify the ingestion of AWS data using AWS Managed Detection Testing test rules.

predefined test rules.
Verify the ingestion of Azure data
The Google SecOps Data Ingestion and Health dashboard
lets you see information about the type, volume, and health of all data being ingested
into Google SecOps using SIEM ingestion features.
You can use also Azure Managed Detection Testing test rules to
verify the ingestion of Azure data. After setting up the ingestion, you perform
actions in the Azure portal that should trigger the test rules.
They are intended to verify that data is ingested and in the expected format
to use the curated detections for Azure data.

Testing .
Enable both Status and Alerting for the Broad and Precise
rules.
Send user action data to trigger the test rules
To verify that data is ingested as expected, create a user and login to verify that
these actions trigger the test rules. For information about creating users in Microsoft Entra ID, see
How to create, invite, and delete users .
In Azure, create a new Microsoft Entra ID user.
Important: The following steps must be performed as a user in the chosen account
that has permission to create a new user in Microsoft Entra ID.
