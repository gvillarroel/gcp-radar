Integrate Anomali STAXX with Google SecOps
This document explains how to integrate Anomali STAXX with
Google Security Operations (Google SecOps).
Integration parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the integration:
Parameter name
Type
Default value
Is mandatory
Description
Instance Name
String
N/A
No
Name of the Instance you intend to configure integration for.
Description
String
N/A
No
Description of the Instance.
Server Address
String
https://<ip>:<port>
Yes
Server address of the Anomali STAXX instance.
Username
String
N/A
Yes
Username of the Anomali STAXX account.
Password
Password
N/A
Yes
Password of the Anomali STAXX account.
Verify SSL
Checkbox
Unchecked
No
If enabled, verifies that the SSL certificate for the connection to the Anomali STAXX server is valid.
Run Remotely
Checkbox
Checked
No
Check the field in order to run the configured integration remotely. Once checked, the option appears to select the remote user (agent).
For instructions about how to configure an integration in
Google SecOps, see Configure
integrations .
You can make changes at a later stage, if needed. After you configure an
integration instance, you can use it in playbooks. For more information about
how to configure and support multiple instances, see Supporting
multiple instances .
Actions
For more information about actions, see
Respond to pending actions from Your Workdesk and Perform a
manual action .
Ping
Test connectivity to Anomali STAXX with parameters provided at the integration
configuration page in the Google Security Operations Marketplace tab.
Parameters
None.
Run on
This action doesn't run on entities, nor has mandatory input parameters.
Action results
Script result
Script result name
Value options
Example
is_success
True or False
is_success:False
Case wall
Result type
Description
Type
Output message*
The action should not fail nor stop a playbook execution:
if successful: "Successfully connected to the Anomali STAXX server with the provided connection parameters!"
The action should fail and stop a playbook execution:
If not successful: "Failed to connect to the Anomali STAXX server! Error is {0}".format(exception.stacktrace)
General
Connectors
To learn more about configuring connectors in Google SecOps,
see Ingest your data (connectors) .
Note: To prevent data loss, connectors utilize Event Flattening . If a raw alert
contains a list of entities (such as multiple email addresses, hostnames, or IP addresses),
connectors automatically flatten them into separate, unique events.
For example, a single raw alert containing three different email addresses is ingested as three
separate events, each containing one distinct email address.
This process ensures that every entity is correctly indexed as a unique asset, making it fully
searchable and actionable in playbooks.
Anomali STAXX - Indicators Connector
Pull indicators from Anomali STAXX.
Connector parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the connector:
Parameter name
Type
Default value
Is mandatory
Description
Product Field Name
String
Product Name
Yes
The name of the field where the product name is stored.
The product name primarily impacts mapping. To streamline and improve the mapping process for
the connector, the default value resolves to a fallback value that is referenced
from the code. Any invalid input for this parameter resolves to a fallback
value by default.
The default value is Product Name .
Event Field Name
String
itype
Yes
The name of the field that determines the event name (subtype).
Environment Field Name
String
""
No
The name of the field where the environment name is stored.
If the
environment field is missing, the connector uses the default value.
Environment Regex Pattern
String
.*
No
A regular expression pattern to run on the value found in the
Environment Field Name field. This parameter lets you manipulate
the environment field using the regular expression logic.
Use the default value .* to retrieve the required raw
Environment Field Name value.
If the regular expression pattern is null or empty, or the environment
value is null, the final environment result is the default environment.
Script Timeout (Seconds)
Int
180
Yes
The timeout limit, in seconds, for the Python process that runs the
current script.
Server Address
String
https://<ip>:<port>
Yes
Server address of the Anomali STAXX instance.
Username
String
N/A
Yes
Username of the Anomali STAXX account.
Password
Password
N/A
Yes
Password of the Anomali STAXX account.
Server Timezone
String
N/A
No
Specify which timezone is set on the Anomali STAXX server in regards to UTC,
such as +1 or -1 . If nothing is specified, the
connector uses UTC as a default timezone.
Lowest Severity To Fetch
String
Medium
Yes
Lowest severity that will be used to fetch Indicators.
Possible values:
Low
Medium
High
Critical
Lowest Confidence To Fetch
Integer
0
No
Lowest confidence that will be used to fetch indicators.
Fetch Max Hours Backwards
Integer
1
No
The number of hours prior to now to retrieve indicators.
This parameter can apply to the initial connector iteration after you enable
the connector for the first time, or the fallback value for an expired connector
timestamp.
Max Indicators To Fetch
Integer
50
No
How many indicators to process per one connector iteration.
Use whitelist as a blacklist
Checkbox
Unchecked
Yes
If selected, the connector uses the dynamic list as a blocklist.
Verify SSL
Checkbox
Unchecked
Yes
If selected, the integration validates the SSL certificate when connecting to
the Anomali STAXX server.
Proxy Server Address
String
N/A
No
The address of the proxy server to use.
Proxy Username
String
N/A
No
The proxy username to authenticate with.
Proxy Password
Password
N/A
No
The proxy password to authenticate with.
Connector rules
The connector supports proxies.
