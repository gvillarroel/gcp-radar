Onboard a Google SecOps instance
Supported in:
Google secops
This document describes how to onboard (deploy) a Google SecOps
(SIEM and SOAR) instance, and enable Google SecOps features based on your
Google SecOps package tier and entitlements. These onboarding steps apply to the
following Google SecOps packages : Standard , Enterprise , and
Enterprise Plus .
Your designated onboarding SME , also referred to as the
Google SecOps SME or the billing administrator , performs the
onboarding process. This person serves as your organization's main point of
contact for Google SecOps.
Prerequisites
Before you can onboard a new Google SecOps instance, make sure
your organization has met these prerequisites:
An active registration for one of the following
Google SecOps packages :
Standard , Enterprise , or Enterprise Plus .
A signed Google SecOps contract from your organization. This contract gives
you permission to provision each new Google SecOps instance.
Deploy a new Google SecOps instance
Perform these steps to deploy a new Google SecOps instance:
Sign the Google SecOps contract.
Provisioning a new Google SecOps instance starts when your
organization signs a Google SecOps contract. This action
triggers Google's internal onboarding workflow and registers the contract
details in Google's system, including your billing account and your
onboarding SME's email address.
Prepare your environment for onboarding .
Your onboarding SME should prepare your environment before you onboard a new
Google SecOps instance.
Onboard a new Google SecOps instance .
Contact your account team or partner team to deploy additional instances.
Prepare your environment for onboarding
The onboarding SME should prepare your environment before onboarding a
Google SecOps instance, as described in these sections:
Grant permissions to perform onboarding .
Set up an Assured Workloads folder (optional) .
Configure a Google Cloud project .
Configure an identity provider .
Grant permissions to perform onboarding
For each new Google SecOps instance, grant the required
onboarding roles and permissions to the onboarding SME, as described in
Required roles and permissions .
Set up an Assured Workloads folder (optional)
To create an Assured Workloads folder:
Go to the Create a new Assured Workloads folder page.
In the list, select the control package * type you want to apply to the
Assured Workloads folder.
Make sure you have the required permissions listed in the Required IAM
roles section.
Follow the steps in the
Create an Assured Workloads folder for... section.
Note: If you manage multiple organizations, select the correct
organization where the Assured Workloads folder should be
created. For region , select US , which corresponds to the US
multi-region .
As you set up your folder, consider these guidelines:
A compliance controlled tenant (instance) is one that must conform to one or
more of the following compliance control standards: FedRAMP ,
FedRAMP_MODERATE , HIPAA , PCI_DSS , FedRAMP_HIGH , IL4 ,
IL5 , CMEK_V1 , or DRZ_ADVANCED .
All files associated with a compliance-controlled tenant must reside in an
Assured Workloads folder that is configured for the appropriate
compliance control standard.
An Assured Workloads folder is created at the organization level.
An organization can create multiple Assured Workloads folders, each
dedicated to a specific compliance control package based on its requirements.
For example, one folder may support FedRAMP_MODERATE instances, while
another FedRAMP_HIGH instances.
Consider these guidelines when you deploy a compliance controlled tenant (instance):
You must link the compliance controlled tenant (instance) to a Google Cloud
project that is located within an Assured Workloads folder.
If you plan to create a new Google Cloud project for your
Google SecOps instance, you must create the project within an
Assured Workloads folder that is configured for the required
compliance control package.
If your organization doesn't have an Assured Workloads folder, you must create one.
Each new Google SecOps instance must be linked to a
Google Cloud project. You can use an existing Google Cloud project or
create a new one.
To create a new Google Cloud project:
For a FedRAMP-compliant tenant (instance), create the project within your
organization's Assured Workloads folder. If your organization
doesn't have an Assured Workloads folder for the required control
package, create one .
Follow the steps in
Create a project .
Note: Use the <CUSTOMER-name>-chronicle naming convention and confirm that
the project's billing account matches your Google SecOps
instance's billing account. Note: To allocate charges to a different billing account, you must enter a new order.
Configure a Google Cloud project
A Google Cloud project acts as the control layer for the linked
Google SecOps instance.
To set it up properly, follow the steps in
Configure a Google Cloud project for Google SecOps .
Configure an identity provider
Configure an identity provider to manage users, groups, and authentication for your Google SecOps instance.
There are two supported options:
Option 1: Google Cloud Identity :
Use this option if you have a Google Workspace account, or you sync
identities from your IdP to Google Cloud.
Create managed user accounts to control access to Google Cloud resources and
your Google SecOps instance.
Define IAM policies using predefined or custom roles to grant
feature access to users and groups.
For detailed instructions, see
Configure a Google Cloud identity provider .
Note: This option is not supported for FedRAMP , IL4 , or IL5 compliance customers.
Option 2: Workforce Identity Federation :
Use this option if you use a third-party IdP (such as Okta or Azure AD).
Configure Google's
Workforce Identity Federation
and create a workforce identity pool. Google's
Workforce Identity Federation lets you grant on-premises or multi-cloud
workloads access to Google Cloud resources, without using
service account keys.
For detailed instructions, see
Configure a third-party identity provider .
Onboard a new Google SecOps instance
The Google system sends a Google SecOps onboarding invitation
email to your onboarding SME. This email includes an activation link to
initiate the setup process.
Important: The Google Cloud project that hosts your Google SecOps instance must be linked to the exact same billing account ID that was used to book your Google SecOps subscription order. If these accounts do not match, the system can't apply your subscription credits to your usage, resulting in incorrect charges. To allocate charges to a different billing account, you must enter a new order.
After preparing your environment for onboarding, the onboarding SME should do
the following:
Click the activation link in the invitation email.
Perform the steps in the following sections to deploy the
Google SecOps instance:
Configure a new Google SecOps instance
and link it to a Google Cloud project.
Configure feature access control using IAM .
Configure data RBAC for users .
Map IdP groups to access control parameters
to complete the deployment.
Required roles and permissions
This section lists the roles and permissions required to deploy a Google SecOps instance.
Grant these permissions to the onboarding SME performing the deployment tasks:
All roles and permissions must be granted at the project level . These
permissions apply only to the specified Google Cloud project and the
associated Google SecOps instance. To deploy additional
instances, contact your account team or partner team.
If you deploy another Google SecOps instance under a different
contract, you must grant a new set of roles and permissions for that
deployment.
Grant the onboarding SME the roles and permissions listed in these following
sections:
Permissions in the Google billing account
Predefined IAM roles
Permissions to create an Assured Workloads folder
