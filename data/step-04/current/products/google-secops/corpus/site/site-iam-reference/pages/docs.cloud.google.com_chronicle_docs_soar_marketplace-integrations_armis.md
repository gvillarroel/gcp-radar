General
Connector
To learn more about configuring connectors in Google SecOps,
see Ingest your data (connectors) .
Note: To prevent data loss, connectors utilize Event Flattening . If a raw alert
contains a list of entities (such as multiple email addresses, hostnames, or IP addresses),
connectors automatically flatten them into separate, unique events.
For example, a single raw alert containing three different email addresses is ingested as three
separate events, each containing one distinct email address.
This process ensures that every entity is correctly indexed as a unique asset, making it fully
searchable and actionable in playbooks.
Armis - Alerts Connector
Pull alerts with related activities from Armis.
Connector parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the connector:
Parameter name
Type
Default value
Is mandatory
Description
Product Field Name
String
alert_type
Yes
The name of the field where the product name is stored.
The default
value is alert_type .
The product name
primarily impacts mapping. To streamline and improve the mapping process for
the connector, the default value alert_type resolves to a
fallback value that is referenced from the code. Any invalid input for this
parameter resolves to a fallback value by default.
Event Field Name
String
type
Yes
The name of the field that determines the event name (subtype).
Environment Field Name
String
""
No
The name of the field where the environment name is stored.
If the
environment field is missing, the connector uses the default value.
Environment Regex Pattern
String
.*
No
A regular expression pattern to run on the value found in the
Environment Field Name field. This parameter lets you manipulate
the environment field using the regular expression logic.
Use the default value .* to retrieve the required raw
Environment Field Name value.
If the regular expression pattern is null or empty, or the environment
value is null, the final environment result is the default environment.
Script Timeout (Seconds)
Integer
180
Yes
The timeout limit, in seconds, for the Python process that runs the
current script.
API Root
String
https://{{api_root}}
Yes
API root of the Armis instance.
API Secret
Password
N/A
Yes
API Secret of the Armis account.
Lowest Severity To Fetch
Low
Low
No
Lowest severity that will be used to fetch alerts. Possible values:
Low , Medium , High .
Max Hours Backwards
Integer
1
No
The number of hours before the first connector iteration to retrieve the
alerts.
This parameter can apply to the initial connector iteration after you enable
the connector for the first time, or the fallback value for an expired connector
timestamp.
Max Alerts To Fetch
Integer
10
No
The number of alerts to process per one connector iteration. The maximum
value is 1000 .
Use whitelist as a blacklist
Checkbox
Checked
Yes
If selected, the connector uses the dynamic list as a blocklist.
Verify SSL
Checkbox
Unchecked
Yes
If selected, the integration validates the SSL certificate when connecting to
the Armis server.
Proxy Server Address
String
No
The address of the proxy server to use.
Proxy Username
String
No
The proxy username to authenticate with.
Proxy Password
Password
No
The proxy password to authenticate with.
Connector rules
The connector supports proxies.
