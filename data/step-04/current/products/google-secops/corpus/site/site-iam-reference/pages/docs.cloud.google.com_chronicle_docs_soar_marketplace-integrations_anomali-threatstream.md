Integrate Anomali ThreatStream with
Google SecOps
This document describes how to integrate Anomali ThreatStream with
Google Security Operations (Google SecOps).
Integration parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the integration:
Parameter name
Type
Default value
Is mandatory
Description
Web Root
String
https://siemplify.threatstream.com
Yes
Web Root of the Anomali ThreatStream instance.
This parameter is used for creating report links across integration items.

For instructions about how to configure an integration in
Google SecOps, see Configure
integrations .
You can make changes at a later stage, if needed. After you configure an
integration instance, you can use it in playbooks. For more information about
how to configure and support multiple instances, see Supporting
multiple instances .

Output message*
The action should not fail nor stop a playbook execution:
If successful and at least one hash across entities is found (is_success=true): "Successfully added tags to the following entities in Anomali ThreatStream:\n{0}".format(entity.identifier list)
If not found specific entities (is_success=true): "The following entities were not found in Anomali ThreatStream\n: {0}".format([entity.identifier])

General
Enrich entities
Retrieve information about IPs, URLs, hashes, email addresses from Anomali
ThreatStream.

Type
Default value
Is mandatory
Description
Severity Threshold
DDL
Low
Possible values:
Very High
High
Medium
Low
Yes
Specify what should be the severity threshold for the entity, in order to mark it as suspicious. If multiple records are found for the same entity, action will take the highest severity out of all available records.
Confidence Threshold
Integer
N/A
Yes
Specify what should be the confidence threshold for the entity, in order to mark it as suspicious. Note: Maximum is 100. If multiple records are found for the entity, action will take the average. Active records have priority.
Ignore False Positive Status
Checkbox
Unchecked
No
If enabled, action will ignore the false positive status and mark the entity as suspicious based on the Severity Threshold and Confidence Threshold. If disabled, action will never label false positive entities as suspicious, regardless, if they pass the Severity Threshold and "Confidence Threshold" conditions or not.
Add Threat Type To Case
Checkbox
Unchecked
No
If enabled, action will add threat types of the entity from all records as tags to the case. Example: apt
Only Suspicious Entity Insight
Checkbox
Unchecked
Yes
If enabled, action will create insight only for entities that exceeded the Severity Threshold and Confidence Threshold.
Create Insight
Checkbox
Unchecked
Yes
If enabled, action will add an insight per processed entity.

Entity
Connectors
To learn more about configuring connectors in Google SecOps,
see Ingest your data (connectors) .
Note: To prevent data loss, connectors utilize Event Flattening . If a raw alert
contains a list of entities (such as multiple email addresses, hostnames, or IP addresses),
connectors automatically flatten them into separate, unique events.
For example, a single raw alert containing three different email addresses is ingested as three
separate events, each containing one distinct email address.
This process ensures that every entity is correctly indexed as a unique asset, making it fully
searchable and actionable in playbooks.
Anomali ThreatStream - Observables Connector
Pull observables from Anomali ThreatStream.
Source names are used in the dynamic list.
To find the ID of a trusted circle, locate the trusted circle on Anomali
ThreatStream, and click its name. The URL displayed in the address bar shows
the ID, such as https://siemplify.threatstream.com/search?trustedcircles=13 .
Connector parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the connector:
Parameter name
Type
Default value
Is mandatory
Description
Product Field Name
String
Product Name
Yes
The name of the field where the product name is stored.
The product name primarily impacts mapping. To streamline and improve the mapping process for
the connector, the default value resolves to a fallback value that is referenced
from the code. Any invalid input for this parameter resolves to a fallback
value by default.
The default value is Product Name .
Event Field Name
String
type
Yes
The name of the field that determines the event name (subtype).
Environment Field Name
String
""
No
The name of the field where the environment name is stored.
If the
environment field is missing, the connector uses the default value.
Environment Regex Pattern
String
.*
No
A regular expression pattern to run on the value found in the
Environment Field Name field. This parameter lets you manipulate
the environment field using the regular expression logic.
Use the default value .* to retrieve the required raw
Environment Field Name value.
If the regular expression pattern is null or empty, or the environment
value is null, the final environment result is the default environment.
Script Timeout (Seconds)
Integer
300
Yes
Timeout limit for the python process running the current script.
API Root
String
https://api.threatstream.com
Yes
API root of the Anomali ThreatStream instance.
Email Address
String
N/A
Yes
Email address of the Anomali ThreatStream account.
API Key
Password
N/A
Yes
API Key of the Anomali ThreatStream account.
Lowest Severity To Fetch
String
High
Yes
Lowest severity that will be used to fetch observables.
Possible values:
Low
Medium
High
Very-High
Lowest Confidence To Fetch
Integer
50
Yes
