Ingestion API
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
This document explains how to use Backstory Ingestion to forward logs directly to your Google Security Operations instance, eliminating the need for additional hardware or software (for example, forwarders) in your environment.
Note: To use Ingestion methods in Chronicle API, see Ingestion methods (new) . Note: The maximum log size is 1 MB.
The Ingestion method is a RESTful API with a JSON payload. Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) and Technology Partners can develop systems to call Ingestion directly and forward logs to Google SecOps.
The Ingestion supports:
UDM events
Unstructured logs
Log types retrieval
You can forward your data to Google SecOps using either of the following types of Ingestion endpoints:
Unified Data Model (UDM) event
Unstructured log
If you have formatted your log data using Google SecOps UDM, you can forward UDM events to your Google SecOps account using the UDM API endpoint. Since UDM events are standardized, Google SecOps is better able to process and interpret the data, increasing Google SecOps's ability to recognize security compromises and threats within your enterprise. See Format log data as UDM for information about converting raw logs to UDM.
You can also forward your data to Google SecOps as unstructured logs using the unstructured log API endpoints. Your unstructured log data is normalized within the Google SecOps infrastructure and made available to you through the Google SecOps UI. However, some information may be difficult to extract from the unstructured log data and might only be searchable using Raw Log Scan.
Important: Occasionally, logs sent through the ingestion API or streaming endpoints
(Webhook, Pub/Sub, Amazon Data Firehose) don't contain separate log lines.
This causes Google SecOps to treat multiple lines as a single entry, leading
to parsing errors. To avoid parsing errors, ensure that all log lines start on a new
line.
When the Ingestion API takes a batch of logs, it generates a
batch ID for those logs. If the batch ID of those logs is a duplicate of an
existing batch ID, then the new batch of logs is not forwarded to the
Google SecOps instance. The deduplication of the batch depends on the batch
ID, which is the same for different batches if the logs contained in those
batches are the same. Deduplication occurs across feeds when the Customer ID, raw log payload, and UDM data are identical for a customer. The Log Type is not included in the deduplication hash.
Whenever possible, we recommend forwarding your data to Google SecOps as UDM events.
Get API authentication credentials
Your Google Security Operations representative provides you with a Google Developer
service account credential to enable the API client to communicate with the API, and share its credentials (JSON key) so your API client can authenticate to the API.
You also must provide the Auth Scope when initializing your API client. OAuth 2.0 uses
a scope to limit an application's access to an account. When an application requests a scope,
the access token issued to the application is limited to the scope granted.
Use the following scope to initialize your Google API client:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/malachite-ingestion
Python example
The following Python example demonstrates how to use OAuth 2.0 credentials and the
HTTP client, with google.oauth2 and googleapiclient . Note, you may need
to use the OAuth 2.0 credentials contained in the apikeys-demo.json
file.
# Imports required for the sample - Google Auth and API Client Library.
# Install these packages from https://pypi.org/project/google-api-python-client/
# or run from your terminal: pip install google-api-python-client
import json
from google.auth.transport import requests
from google.oauth2 import service_account
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/malachite-ingestion']
# The apikeys-demo.json file contains the OAuth 2 credentials.
# ING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE is the full path to the ingestion apikeys.json file.
# ToDo: Replace with the full path to the OAuth 2.0 credentials file.
ING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = '/customer-keys/apikeys.json'
# Customer ID is available at /settings/profile on your Google Security Operations.
CUSTOMER_ID= CUSTOMER_ID
# Create a credential using an Ingestion Service Account Credential file
# and the Google Security Operations API Scope.
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(ING_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)
# Build a requests Session Object to make authorized OAuth requests.
http_session = requests.AuthorizedSession(credentials)
# UDM Event example (example: US region)
url = 'https://malachiteingestion-pa.googleapis.com/v2/udmevents:batchCreate'
# For other regions, you may need to use another regional endpoint for your API call; see
# https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/ingestion-api#regional_endpoints
# json_events are a collection of UDM events in (serialized) JSON format.
body = {
"customerId": CUSTOMER_ID,
"events": json.loads(json_events),
}
response = http_session.request("POST", url, json=body)
# For more complete examples, see:

The Service Account Credential provided to you corresponds to one Google SecOps instance. The requests that are issued to the Ingestion API include a field, customer_id , which is a unique identifier for a Google SecOps instance. This is provided by your Google SecOps representative. The credential used when issuing requests and the unique identifier must correspond.

Ingestion API reference
This sections describes how to use the Ingestion API methods.
udmevents
Use this method to forward UDM events to Google SecOps in batches.
The udmevents endpoint ingests pre-parsed telemetry that has been structured into UDM events. Because these events are already normalized, they bypass the internal Configuration-Based Normalizer (CBN) parsing layer and move directly to the indexing and rules engine. Use this ingestion path if you manage your own data transformation before transmission. This approach reduces end-to-end latency by eliminating your need for server-side parsing.
Note: Events ingested with udmevents won't have any raw logs associated with them since this endpoint only ingests UDM events. Ingested data has the log_type = "UDM" and you can find this data by using a search string, such as metadata.log_type = "UDM" .
Request
POST https://malachiteingestion-pa.googleapis.com/v2/udmevents:batchCreate
Request body
The following example illustrates how you could format your log data using the udmevents API endpoint. It shows how to format your enterprise log data using UDM.
Note: The <Noun>.mac field accepts both uppercase and lowercase characters.
Noun is principal , src , target , observer , intermediary , or about .
Character values will be converted and stored as lowercase.

customer_id
string
Yes
Unique identifier (UUID) corresponding to a particular Google SecOps instance. Provided by your Google SecOps representative.
events[]
array
Yes
Array of UDM events.
Response
You shouldn't receive a response unless there's an error in the method syntax.
unstructuredlogentries
Use this method to forward unstructured log entries to Google SecOps one batch at a time.
Each batch of log data has a maximum size limit of 1 MB (uncompressed). Use only one timestamp format per batch—either ts_epoch_microseconds or ts_rfc3339 , but not both.
If no separate timestamp is provided, ensure that a timestamp is included within the log_text field.
Note: The 1 MB maximum size limit applies to uncompressed payload data. If you send compressed payload data,
ensure that the batch size is limited to 1 MB after decompression.
Request
POST https://malachiteingestion-pa.googleapis.com/v2/unstructuredlogentries:batchCreate
Request body
The following example illustrates how you could format your log data using the unstructuredlogentries API endpoint. It shows how to format three BIND DNS logs.
When sending the timestamp as a separate name-value pair, use the same key for all entries in the batch. For example, in a single batch, don't use ts_epoch_microseconds for one entry and ts_rfc3339 for another entry.
For example, this payload will return an error because it includes both ts_epoch_microseconds and ts_rfc3339 .

Frequently asked questions
What is the maximum batch size (per HTTP request)?
4 MB when uncompressed (in case the incoming batch is compressed).
Can a customer create an allowlist to include certain public IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the collector API endpoint? Or do you support other forms of client authorization?
Google SecOps doesn't support IP allowlisting. Any client with a valid API key can connect.
Does the API endpoint vary depending on the region?
Yes. Your API endpoint will vary depending on where your customer account is provisioned. See Regional Endpoints .
What should the request timeout be?
Clients should use a request timeout of 90 seconds.
What should we do if an HTTP request fails? What are the error codes?
See AIP-193 Errors , specifically the following:
Clients should retry on 5XX errors with exponential backoff. The minimum delay should be 1s unless it is documented otherwise. For 429 errors, the client may retry with minimum 30s delay. For all other errors, retry may not be applicable.
Do you support standard HTTP GZIP compression (for example, Accept-Encoding: gzip header)?
Yes, Google SecOps supports standard HTTP GZIP compression.
What time format should my raw logs follow?
Most of the prebuilt parsers expect one of the following time formats: RFC3339 , UNIX and ISO8601 .
Is there a default timezone if it's missing in the raw log timestamp?
Most of the prebuilt parsers can extract timezone information correctly if it's included in raw logs. In raw logs where the timezone information is missing, the parser applies the UTC timezone to the timestamp in the raw log. This may cause the raw logs to appear as delayed or early during a UDM search. For this reason, it's recommended to include proper timezone information from the source while configuring the syslogs. This is especially important for logs ingested using the Ingestion API, Forwarder and Bindplane agents.
