Search for events and alerts
Supported in:
Google secops
SIEM
The search function lets you find Unified Data Model (UDM) events and alerts
in your Google Security Operations instance using YARA-L 2.0 syntax . Search includes options to refine and navigate through your UDM data. You can search for individual UDM events and groups of UDM events that match the same query.
Note: UDM search is limited to 100 UDM fields per single query in the UDM Search prompt.
On systems that use data RBAC, you can only see data that matches your scopes. For more information, see data RBAC impact on Search .
For Google SecOps customers, alerts can also be ingested from
connectors
and webhooks . You
can use search to find these alerts as well.
For more information about UDM, see Format log data as
UDM and UDM field
list .
Search limits and quotas
Google SecOps enforces limits on search queries to ensure
platform stability and consistent performance across programmatic and web interface.
These limits apply to both Backstory and Chronicle APIs.
Feature
Programmatic access limit
Web interface limit
QPH limit
2,000
1,000
Simple query concurrency
40
40
Complex query concurrency
10
10
Concurrency limits
Concurrency limits define the number of simultaneous search operations allowed
per tenant:
Simple queries: Queries that span less than one day, use a single data source,
and don't include stats.
Complex queries: Queries that span more than 1 day, use multiple sources,
or include stats.
If your simple query concurrency limit is exhausted, they automatically
consume available complex query quota.
Quota errors
When a limit is reached, the web interface displays a quota error. For programmatic
access, the API returns a 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED error containing a
google.rpc.QuotaFailure message that details the specific limit you exceeded.
Access search
You can access Google SecOps search using the following options:
On the navigation bar, click Investigation > Search .
In the Search field, enter a valid UDM field
for any search field in Google SecOps, and then press CTRL+Enter .
Figure 1. Example of the Search window used to explore event trends.
The following sections detail how to use the search features.
Use the search feature
A search expression consists of a UDM field to search, an operator , and a
data value to search for.
If the query expression is valid, the Google SecOps console
enables the Run search button.
UDM queries are based on fields defined in the
Unified Data Model field list .
You can browse and select these UDM fields using Filters or Raw Log Search .
To adjust the number of events returned, click
more_vert More and select
Search settings . For details, see Search settings .
To change the data range, open the Date range window.
To use the search feature, complete the following steps:
Go to the Search page.
In the Search field, enter a search expression.
To search for events, enter a UDM field name in the Search field. As you
type, the automatic completion feature suggests valid UDM fields based on
your input.
Once you have entered a valid UDM field, select a valid operator. The user
interface displays the available valid operators based on the UDM field you
entered. The following operators are supported:
<, >
<=, >=
=, !=
nocase -- supported for strings
After you enter a valid UDM field and operator, add the log data value you
want to search for. For details, see Format the data value to search
for .
Click Run search to run your search.
The event results are displayed in the
Events timeline table on the Search page.
Optional: Narrow the results by adding additional UDM filters manually or
using the console.
Format the data value to search for
Format the data value using the following guidelines:
Data type: Format the data value based it's the data type:
Enumerated values: Use a valid enumerated value defined for the
selected UDM field.
For example: A text value, all caps enclosed in double quotes:
metadata.event_type = "NETWORK_CONNECTION"
Additional values: Use the field[key\] = value format to search
within additional and labels fields.
For example:
additional.fields["key"]="value"
Boolean values: Use true or false (case-insensitive, no quotes needed).
For example:
network.dns.response = true
Integers : Use numeric values without quotes.
For example:
target.port = 443
Float values: For UDM fields of the float type, enter a decimal
value, such as 3.1 , or an integer, such as 3 .
For example:
security_result.about.asset.vulnerabilities.cvss_base_score = 3.1
Regular expressions: Enclose the regular expression between forward
slashes (/).
For example:
principal.ip = /10.*/
Search for the execution of psexec.exe (Window):
target.process.command_line = /\bpsexec(\.exe)?\b/ nocase
For details about regular expressions, see the
regular expressions page .
Strings: Enclose text values in double quotes.
For example:
metadata.product_name = "Google Cloud VPC Flow Logs"
Case-insensitive strings : Use the nocase operator to match any
combination of uppercase and lowercase characters in a string.
For example:
principal.hostname != "http-server" nocase
principal.hostname = "JDoe" nocase
principal.hostname = /dns-server-[0-9]+/ nocase
Escape characters in strings : Escape special characters with a
backslash, as follows:
Use \\ to escape a backslash (\).
Use \" to escape a double quote ( " ).
For example:
principal.process.file.full_path = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Application\\chrome.exe"
target.process.command_line = "cmd.exe /c \"c:\\program files\\a.exe\""
Boolean expressions : Use AND , OR , and NOT to combine conditions
and narrow results.
The following examples show supported boolean
operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ):
A AND B
A OR B
Use parentheses ( ) to group expressions and control evaluation order:
(A OR B) AND (B OR C) AND (C OR NOT D)
Examples:
Search for login events on the finance server:
metadata.event_type = "USER_LOGIN" and target.hostname = "finance-svr"
Use the operator (>) to search for connections where more than 10 MB of
data was sent:
metadata.event_type = "NETWORK_CONNECTION" and network.sent_bytes > 10000000
Use multiple conditions to search for winword.exe launching cmd.exe or powershell.exe :
metadata.event_type = "PROCESS_LAUNCH" and
principal.process.file.full_path = /winword/ and
( target.process.file.full_path = /cmd.exe/ or
target.process.file.full_path = /powershell.exe/ )
Search key-value pairs in additional and labels fields:
The additional and labels fields act as customizable containers for
event data that doesn't map to standard UDM fields. Each entry stores a
single key-value pair.
additional fields may contain multiple key-value pairs.
labels fields can only contain a single key-value pair.
Use this syntax to specify the key-value pairs to search in the additional
and labels fields:
field[key\] = value .
For example:
additional.fields["key"]="value"
Examples of searches using specific key-value pairs in the additional and
labels fields:
Search for events containing specified key-value pairs:
additional.fields["pod_name"] = "kube-scheduler"
metadata.ingestion_labels["MetadataKeyDeletion"] = "startup-script"
Use the AND operator with key-value pair searches:
additional.fields["pod_name"] = "kube-scheduler" AND additional.fields["pod_name1"] = "kube-scheduler1"
Search for all events that contain the specified key, regardless of the value:
additional.fields["pod_name"] != ""
Search for events that contain a specific key, using a regular expression:
additional.fields.value.string_value = "mystring"
Note: You can also use value.bool_value or value.number_value for
boolean and numeric matches.
Search for events that use
multiple keys with the same name, using a regular expression:
additional.fields.key = /myKeynumber_*/
Use regular expressions and the nocase operator:
additional.fields["pod_name"] = /br/
additional.fields["pod_name"] = bar nocase
Use block and single-line comments.
Use a block comment:
additional.fields["pod_name"] = "kube-scheduler"
/*
Block comments can span
multiple lines.
*/
AND additional.fields["pod_name1"] = "kube-scheduler1"
Use a single-line comment:
additional.fields["pod_name"] != "" // my single-line comment
Search settings
You can set the maximum number of search results in UDM search settings .
These settings are user-specific.
Click Search settings from the
more_vert More next to Run search .
Select Max results to return . The options are 1K , 30K , 100K , 1M
and custom , which can take values between 1 and 1M . The default value
is 1M . Queries usually run faster when you choose a smaller result set
size.
Use auto-suggestions to build queries
When you write a query, the editor provides auto-suggestions to
help you build queries efficiently.
Navigate and select suggestions
As you type, a list appears with field suggestions matching your text.
Select a field : Use the Up or Down arrow keys to navigate the list,
and press Enter to select a field.
View metadata : After you use the Up or Down arrow keys to highlight
a suggestion, click chevron_right
to view the field description.
Complete fields incrementally : The editor suggests the immediate children
of the current field and hides the typed prefix to save screen space. These
suggestions are followed by all other matching fields in alphabetical order.
Complete operators and values : After you select a field, the editor suggests
valid operators (such as =, !=) based on the field's data type. For enumerated fields, the editor displays suggestions for all valid values (for
example, NETWORK_EVENT ) after you type an operator and a double quote ( " ).
Understand suggestion ranking
The editor organizes suggestions into three distinct categories to help you find
fields quickly:
Recently used fields : The top seven suggestions are based on fields you
have used recently that match your typed field. This list is saved in your
browser session history across the Search, Rules, and Dashboard editors.
Clearing your cache or switching browsers resets this history.
Immediate children : The next set of suggestions displays only the first-level
children of the current field.
Global matches : The final section displays all matching fields alphabetically.
Manage auto-suggestion settings
To globally manage how suggestions are displayed, do the following:
Click your profile avatar and select User Preferences from the list.
The User Preferences dialog appears.
In the dialog, click Autosuggestion .
To control the auto-suggestions shown in the query editor, adjust the following
settings:
Enable suggestions while typing : Enables auto-suggestion.
Rank recently used fields first : Displays your most recently used fields
at the top of the list
Suggest immediate child fields : Completes nested fields incrementally,
one child node at a time.
Suggest all available paths : Displays the full, expanded paths for all
nested field suggestions
Click Save .
Identify and resolve query errors
The query editor provides immediate, contextual feedback to help you resolve
syntax and runtime errors. If you enter a query with a syntax or compilation error,
the editor displays a red squiggly line directly beneath the problematic text.
Hold the pointer over the red squiggly line to view a tooltip that displays the
specific error description.
Note: The query editor highlights only one error at a time. This means that you
must fix errors sequentially.
View runtime errors
If your query returns an error, the specific runtime error message appears
persistently in the Results panel. This persistent display ensures the error
context remains visible, helping you troubleshoot and resolve the error.
Search returns too many results
If your search is too broad, Google SecOps displays a warning
message indicating that not all search results can be shown.
In such cases, the system retrieves only the latest results, up to the
search limit of 1M events and 1,000 alerts. However, there may be many more
matching events and alerts that are not displayed.
To capture all relevant results, refine your search by applying additional filters.
Narrow the time range to reduce the dataset size.
Use specific search queries or filters instead of broad terms.
Query precise UDM fields instead of grouped fields when you need results for a single field.
The search results page displays the latest 10,000 results. You can filter
and refine the search results to display the older
results, as an alternative to modifying and rerunning the search.
Limit results
You can limit search results by adding the limit keyword with the maximum
number of search results you want to display. This is useful for generating
quick previews of data, performance optimization, or when you only need a subset
of the results.
For example, if you add the following to your search, it limits the results to a maximum of 25:
limit: 25
Note: You can also add the limit keyword to custom dashboards.
Navigate search results using pagination
To improve browser stability and performance when loading a large number of results,
Google SecOps provides paginated search results.
Use the Rows per page list, on the Events table, to select the number of
rows to display per page (25 to 1,000 events). This pagination applies only to the
10,000 results displayed in the table.
25 to 1,000 events. This pagination applies to the 10,000 results displayed in the table.
Search large result sets
Google SecOps supports returning and navigating up to 1 million results.
This lets you investigate large datasets directly in the web interface without
exporting results. For large searches, the visible fields are limited by default.
Note: After results load, you can apply filters to refine the data without rerunning
the search. This helps you narrow the result sets quickly.
Configure result limits
Use the UDM search settings dialog to control the number of results a search
returns.
Click settings on the
Search page to view the UDM Search Settings dialog.
Select the maximum result limit from the following options:
1k
30k (default)
100k
1M
Custom
Selecting Custom displays a text field that lets you specify
the number of results you want to display.
Select how the results should be returned If a search exceeds the configured
limit:
Sampled events (default): Shows a subset of the complete
results.
Most recent events : Shows only the newest results.
Click Apply .
Navigate result sets
To improve browser stability and performance when loading a large number of events,
Google SecOps provides paginated search results. Use the Rows
per page list in the Events table to select the number of rows to display
per page. Options range from 25 to 1,000 events.
View aggregated results
For statistics-based searches, Google SecOps supports large aggregated
result sets.
Charts show a limited number of values to maintain readability.
When results exceed the visualization limit, the tool displays a notice.
For example, Showing top results .
Selecting a chart value filters the results.
Search grouped fields
Grouped fields are aliases for groups of related UDM fields. You can use them to
query multiple UDM fields at the same time without typing each field
individually.
The following example shows how to enter a query to match the common UDM fields
that might contain the specified IP address:
ip = "1.2.3.4"
You can match a grouped field using a regular expression and using the nocase
operator. Reference lists are also supported. Grouped fields can also be used in
combination with regular UDM fields as shown in the following example:
ip = "5.6.7.8" AND metadata.event_type = "NETWORK_CONNECTION"
Grouped fields have a separate section in Aggregations .
Note: Grouped UDM field searches typically take longer than single UDM field
searches.
Types of grouped UDM fields
You can search across all of the following grouped UDM fields:
Grouped field name
Associated UDM fields

Find a UDM field for search query
While writing a search query, you may not know which UDM field to include.
The UDM Lookup lets you quickly find a UDM field name that contains a text
string in the name or that stores a specific string value. The UDM Lookup
function is not intended to be used to search other data types, such as bytes,
boolean, or numeric. You select one or more results returned by UDM Lookup , and use it
as a starting point for a Search query .
To use UDM Lookup , do the following:
On the Search page, click UDM Lookup .
In the UDM Lookup dialog, select one or more of the following matching
options, to specify the scope of data to search:
UDM Fields : Search for text in UDM field names.
For example: network.dns.questions.name or principal.ip
Values : Search for text in the values assigned to UDM Fields.
For example: dns or google.com .
Note: Text value matching is used to search UDM field name strings and
string field values.
Enter or modify the string in the UDM fields/values Look up field.
As you type, search results appear in the dialog.
The results are slightly different when searching in UDM Fields versus
Values :
Searching for a text string in UDM field names returns an exact match
found at any location in the name.
Figure 2. Search within UDM field names in the UDM Lookup .
Searching for text in Values returns results as follows:
If the string is found at the beginning or end of the value, it is
highlighted in the result, along with the UDM field name and the log
ingestion time.
If the text string is found elsewhere in the value, the result displays
the UDM field name and the text Possible value match .
Figure 3. Search within Values in the UDM Lookup .
In the results list, you can perform the following:
Click the name of a UDM field to see a description of that field.
Select one or more results by clicking the checkbox on the left of each
UDM field name.
Click the Reset button to deselect all selected fields in the
results list.
To append the selected results to the Search field on the Search
page, do one of the following:
Click Append to search .
Click Copy UDM to copy the selected results to the clipboard. Then, close the
UDM lookup dialog, and paste the search query string into the Search
field on the Search page.
Google SecOps converts the selected results to a search query
string as the UDM field name or a name-value pair. If you append multiple
results, each result is added to the end of the existing query in the Search
field using the OR operator.
The appended query string is different depending on the type of match
returned by UDM lookup .
If the result matches a text string in a UDM field name, the full UDM
field name is appended to the query. For example:
principal.artifact.network.dhcp.client_hostname
If the result matches a text string at the beginning or end of a value,
the name-value pair contains the UDM field name and the complete value in
the result. The following are examples:
metadata.log_type = "PCAP_DNS"
network.dns.answers.name = "dns-A901F3j.hat.example.com"
If the result includes the text Possible value match , the name-value pair contains the UDM field name and a regular expression containing the
search term. For example:
principal.process.file.full_path = /google/ NOCASE
The query string generated by UDM Lookup serves as a starting point for
a search query. Edit the Search query on the Search page to fit your use case.
UDM Lookup behavior summary
This section provides more details about UDM Lookup capabilities.
UDM Lookup searches data ingested after August 10, 2023. Data ingested
before this is not searched. It returns results found in unenriched UDM
fields. It does not return matches to enriched fields. For information about
enriched versus unenriched fields, see View events in the Event
Viewer .
Searches using UDM Lookup are case-insensitive. The term hostname returns
the same result as HostName .
Hyphens ( - ) and underscores ( _ ) in a query text string are ignored when
searching Values . The text string dns-l and dnsl both return the value
dns-l .
When searching Values , UDM Lookup does not return matches in the following cases:
Matches in the following UDM fields:
metadata.product_log_id
network.session_id
security_result.rule_id
network.parent_session_id
Matches in UDM fields with a full path that ends in one of the
following values:
.pid For example target.process.pid .
.asset_id For example principal.asset_id .
.product_specific_process_id For example principal.process.product_specific_process_id .
.resource.id For example principal.resource.id .
When searching Values , UDM Lookup displays Possible value match when a match is found in the following cases:
Matches in the following UDM fields:
metadata.description
security_result.description
security_result.detection_fields.value
security_result.summary
network.http.user_agent
Matches in fields with a full path that ends in one of the following values:
.command_line For example principal.process.command_line .
.file.full_path For example principal.process.file.full_path .
.labels.value For example src.labels.value .
.registry.registry_key For example principal.registry.registry_key .
.url For example principal.url .
Matches in fields with a full path that begins with the following values:
additional.fields.value. For example additional.fields.value.null_value .
View alerts in search
To view alerts, click the Alerts tab, located next to the Events tab, at
the top right of the Search page.
How alerts are surfaced
Google SecOps evaluates the events returned in search against
events that exist for alerts in the customer environment. When a search query
event matches an event present in an alert, it is displayed in the
Alert timeline and the resulting Alert table.
Definition of events and alerts
An event is generated from a raw log source that is ingested into
Google SecOps and processed by Google SecOps's
ingestion and normalization process.
Multiple events can be generated from a single raw log source record. An event
represents a set of security-relevant data points that are generated from that
raw log.
In search, an alert is defined as a YARA-L rule detection with alerting
enabled. See running a rule against live data
to learn more.
Other sources of data can be ingested into
Google SecOps as alerts, such as Crowdstrike Falcon Alerts.
These alerts don't surface within search unless they are processed by the
Google SecOps Detection Engine as a YARA-L rule.
Events that are associated with one or more alerts are marked with an Alert chip
in the Event Timeline . If there are multiple alerts associated with the
timeline, the chip displays the numbers of associated alerts.
The timeline displays the latest 1,000 alerts retrieved from search
results. When the 1,000 limit is reached, no more alerts are retrieved. To make
sure you see all the results relevant to your search, refine your search with
filters.
How to investigate an alert
To learn how to use Alert graph and Alert details to investigate an
alert, follow the steps outlined in Investigate an
alert .
Use data tables in Search
You can use the data tables feature in Search. This lets you use your own
existing databases of threat information in conjunction with Search to hunt for
threats in your enterprise.
For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP
addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search
instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search:
events:
$e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip
You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP
addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user
resources:
events:
$e.metadata.event_type = "USER_RESOURCE_UPDATE_CONTENT"
$e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip
You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match
against multiple data table columns. The following example searches
for NETWORK_COONECTION events where the security result is ALLOW . It then
matches those events against the hostnames column and the ip column in the
badApps data table.
events:
$e.metadata.event_type = "NETWORK_CONNECTION"
$e.security_result.action = "ALLOW"
$e.target.asset.asset_id = $assetid
// Event hostname matches at least one value in table column hostname.
$e.target.hostname in %badApps.hostname
// Event IP matches at least one value in table column ip.
$e.target.ip in %badApps.ip
For more information, see Use data tables .
View data table rows in Search
You can view data table rows directly in Search. When you use a data table in
your YARA-L search, the results reference the data table rows linked to the
matching events. These results appear in the Events tab.
Use the Column Manager in Search to select which data table and columns to
display in the results.
Search displays the current state of the data table and its rows when you view
the results.
For more information, see Use data tables .
Refine the search results
Use the Search page features to filter and refine results, as an
alternative to modifying and rerunning the search. For example:
Optimized results view
Timelines chart
Aggregations window
Optimized results view
To maximize the space available for viewing search results,
Google SecOps provides an event-focused view. When you run a
query, the search editor panel automatically collapses to provide more space for
the results.
You can also hide the Charts and Aggregations panels by
default by clearing the related checkboxes in the View Options list. To make
the panels visible again, select the same checkboxes in the list.
Timelines chart
The Timelines chart provides a graphical representation of the number of events
and alerts occurring each day that are being surfaced by the current search.
Events and alerts are displayed on the same timeline chart, which is available
in both the Events and Alerts tab.
The width of each bar depends on the time interval searched. For example, each
bar represents 10 minutes when the search spans 24 hours of data. This chart is
updated dynamically as you modify the existing search.
Note: The maximum search window is 365 days, from the start to end time.
Time range adjustment
Move the slider controls to adjust the chart's time range. When you adjust the time range, the
UDM fields and values and Events tables update to reflect your
selection. You can also click any bar in the histogram to apply its time range
as a snapshot filter and view events from that period.
Note: The time range is based on the parsed event timestamp.
After you adjust the time range, the Filtered events and Query events
checkboxes appear, which lets you further limit the types of events displayed.
Figure 4. Events timelines chart with time range controls.
Perform all-time searches
You can run searches over your entire retention period.
On the search editor panel, click the Time picker to open the Range tab.
From the list, select All time .
Aggregations window
The Aggregations window displays Grouped fields and
UDM fields generated by your UDM search. Grouped fields are used to
search across multiple UDM Fields of a similar type.
A Grouped field , for example, ip , namespace , or user , is a placeholder
variable that groups the values of similar UDM fields . For example, the
namespace grouped field groups all the values from the following UDM Fields :
principal.namespace , src.namespace , and target.namespace .
An Events count is displayed for each Grouped field and UDM field .
The Events count is the number of event records having the same value for
that field.
Grouped fields and UDM fields are sorted from highest to lowest
Events count , and in alphabetical order within the same Events count .
To pin a field to the top of the Aggregations list, click the field's
keep Keep icon.
Figure 5. Aggregations help identify high frequency values.
Using Aggregations , you can further narrow your UDM search . You can
either scroll through the list of UDM fields or search for specific UDM
fields or values using the Search field.
Note: For best results, we recommend narrowing your search down as much as
possible to help improve accuracy and reduce search times.
Filter aggregation fields
Use filter options to narrow the list of UDM fields displayed in the
Aggregations list, as follows:
Figure 6. Example of events that include the selected UDM field value .
Select a UDM field in the Aggregations list, to display a list
Values for that field.
Select a Value from that list and click the
more_vert More menu icon.
Select one of the filter options:
Show only : Only show events that include the selected UDM field value .
Filter out : Filter out events that include the selected UDM field value .
Copy : Copy the UDM field value to your clipboard.
You can add these additional UDM filters to the Filter events field.
Filter events field
The Filter events field displays the filters you've created, and lets you apply
them to the Search field, or remove them as needed.
When you click Apply to search and run , the displayed events are filtered
based on the displayed additional filters, and the Search field is updated. The
search is automatically run again using the same date and time parameters.
Figure 7. Filter events field.
If you click Add filter , a window opens letting you select additional UDM
fields.

View alerts in the Alerts table
You can view alerts by clicking the Alerts tab.
Use Aggregations to sort
alerts by:
Case
Name
Priority
Severity
Status
Verdict
This helps you to focus on the alerts that are most important to you.
Alerts are displayed on the same timeframe as the events are in the Events tab.
This helps you see the connection between events and alerts.
If you want to learn more about a specific alert, click the alert. An
individual Alert detail page opens containing in-depth information
about that alert.
View events in the Events table
All filters and controls affect the list of events shown in the Events
table. Click any event to open the Event Viewer , where you can view both the
raw log and the corresponding UDM record. When you click the event's
timestamp , you can then navigate to the associated Asset , IP address ,
Domain , Hash , or User view. You can also use the Search field to
find a specific event.
Note: The Events table only displays the 10,000 latest events based on any
filters that have been applied.

Download search results with raw log correlation
You can download a maximum of 1 million normalized UDM events as a CSV file for offline analysis. This download includes an option to bundle the original raw logs, giving you precise correlation between parsed UDM records and their source telemetry.
This feature is designed for teams that require external analysis processing or audit trails where you must preserve the relationship between normalized data and original ingestion.
Note: Before you download, use the Column Manager to specify which UDM fields to include in the CSV. The Raw Log column is appended based on your selection.
To download all search results (up to 1 million events):
Click more_vert More and select Download as CSV .
In the configuration dialog, enable the Include raw logs option to append the source log data to each UDM record in the download.
The console displays the exact number of specified events.
View events in the Event Viewer

Use the Pivot Table to analyze events
The Pivot Table lets you analyze events using expressions and functions against
the results from the search.
Complete the following steps to open and configure the Pivot Table:
Run a search.
Click the Pivot tab to open the Pivot Table.
Specify a Group by value to group the events by a specific UDM field.
You can display the results using the default capitalization or using
lowercase only by selecting lowercase from the menu. This option is only
available for string fields. You can specify up to five Group by values by
clicking Add Field .
If your Group by value is one of the hostname fields, you have the following
additional Transform options:
Top N-Level Domain : Pick which level of the domain to display.
For example, using a value of 1 displays just the top level domain
(such as com , gov , or edu ). Using a value of 3 displays the next
two levels of the domain names (such as google.co.uk ).
Get Registered Domain : Displays just the registered domain name (such as google.com , nytimes.com , youtube.com ).
If your Group by value is one of the IP fields, you have the following additional Transform options:
(IP) CIDR Prefix length in bits : You can specify 1 through 32 for IPv4 addresses. For IPv6 addresses, you can specify values up to 128.
If your Group by value includes a timestamp, you have the following additional Transform options:
(Time) Resolution in milliseconds
(Time) Resolution in seconds
(Time) Resolution in minutes
(Time) Resolution in hours
(Time) Resolution in days
Specify a Value for your Pivot from the list of Fields in your results. You
can specify up to five values. After you specify a Field, you must select a
Summarize option. You can summarize by the following options:
sum
count
count distinct
average
stddev
min
max
Specify a value of Event count to return the number of events identified
for this particular search and Pivot Table.
The Summarize options are not universally compatible with the Group by fields. For example, the sum , average , stddev , min , and
max options can only be applied to numeric fields. If you attempt to
associate an incompatible Summarize option with a Group by field,
you receive an error message.
Specify one or more UDM fields and select one or more sorts by using the
Order by option.
Click Apply when you're ready. The results are displayed in the Pivot
Table.
Optional: To download the Pivot Table, click more_vert More and select Download as CSV . If you did not select a pivot, this option is disabled.
