line and displays a tooltip with the specific error description when you hover
over it. Additionally, runtime errors now display persistently in the Results panel
to assist with troubleshooting.
For more information, see
Use auto-suggestions to build queries .

Deprecated
v1 Cloud Storage Feed Types (GCS, S3, SQS, Azure)
The v1 feed types for GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE , AMAZON_S3 , AMAZON_SQS , and AZURE_BLOBSTORE are deprecated and will be discontinued on March 15, 2027 . The new v2 feed types uses the Google Cloud Storage Transfer Service (STS) to provide improved performance, scalability, and reliability.
To ensure continued ingestion, transition your feeds before the March 15, 2027 shutdown date:
Google SecOps will automatically migrate your feeds using v1 feed types to v2 in waves starting from April 6, 2026. To facilitate this, some feeds may require additional IP allowlist or service account permission updates. You can also self-migrate by replacing your existing data feeds with new feeds using v2 feed types.
You can also self-migrate by creating new feeds using v2 feed types to substitute your existing feeds using v1 feed types by following the steps documented in our feed configuration guides before March 15, 2027.
Key Dates:
April 6, 2026: Transition begins; auto-migration available.
September 15, 2026: Support for v1 feeds is discontinued.
March 15, 2027: v1 feeds reach End of Life (EOL) and will stop returning data.
For more information, see Feature deprecations .
April 04, 2026
Feature
Playbook Condition and Multi-Choice Question Flows
The maximum number of branches supported in Playbook Conditions and Multiple Choice Questions has been increased from 6 to 20. This allows for more complex branching logic within a single step.

Deprecated
Chronicle.soarAnalyst , chronicle.soarViewer , chronicle.soarEngineer roles in Cloud IAM are being deprecated and will be fully removed in six months. Although these roles were accessible and can historically be assigned to users in Cloud IAM, they were non-operational. SOAR roles were managed through Permission Groups and with its migration to Cloud IAM as part of the SOAR Migration to Google Cloud , the preceding roles are being deprecated.
To maintain seamless access and adhere to the principle of least privilege, transition your SOAR users to the following options:
Automatically convert your SOAR Permission Groups to custom roles in IAM through self-service migration .
Pre-defined roles: Utilize the enhanced Google SecOps pre-defined roles now available in Cloud IAM.
Custom Roles: Create tailored roles with specific permissions to meet your organization's unique security requirements.

Google Secops has launched a unified rules interface that
brings custom and curated rule management into a single, cohesive workflow.
This update optimizes detection engineering with a redesigned dashboard, an
advanced rule editor, and expanded API capabilities to streamline rule
deployment and troubleshooting.
Key enhancements
Developer and IDE enhancements :
Centralized management: A unified, single dashboard lets you browse, filter, and
manage both custom and curated rules from one location. You can also update
configurations for multiple rules simultaneously.
Curated rule transparency: You can now view the YARA-L text of
curated rules, search directly within their logic, and independently toggle
individual rule statuses without needing to alter the parent rule pack
deployment.
Integrated IDE experience: The rule editor now features an enhanced IDE
experience with inline error highlights, UDM field definitions on hover.
Expanded API and structured search :
The Rules API and dashboard have been upgraded to support deeper programmatic
access and complex filtering:
Robust search syntax: Both the UI and API now support AIP-160 compliant
structured search. You can filter rules by text, tags, author, and execution
state.
Batch modifications: The rules.modifyRules method now supports
non-atomic batch updates, letting you change live status, alerting status, tags,
and archive status across multiple rules in a single API request.
Advanced resource views: The rules.list method introduces CONFIG_ONLY
and TRENDS views. These views provide expanded deployment information, access
to curated rule resources, and larger page sizes (up to 5000 results) for
efficient querying.
For details, see Manage unified rules .

Feature
Added support for Google Cloud VPC Service Controls
This feature is currently in Preview.
VPC Service Controls helps protect against accidental or targeted action
by external entities or insider entities, which helps to minimize unwarranted
data exfiltration risks from Google Cloud services. You can use VPC Service Controls to create perimeters
that protect the resources and data of services that you explicitly specify. For more information, see Overview of VPC Service Controls .

Search
Dashboards
For more information, see Cross joins in multi-stage queries .
Feature
RBAC for ingestion metrics
Administrators can now use RBAC for ingestion metrics to restrict visibility of system health data, such as ingestion volume, errors, and throughput, based on a user's business scope.
The Data Ingestion and Health dashboard now uses Data Access scopes. When a scoped user loads the dashboard, the system automatically filters metrics to show only data that matches their assigned labels: Namespace, Log Type, and Ingestion Source.
For more information, see Ingestion metrics .

Feature
Advanced Joins in Search
Google SecOps now supports expanded capabilities for correlating data across
multiple sources. These join operations are also supported in multistage queries.
Joins without a match section : You can now use join operations to correlate
and combine data from multiple sources based on common field values without
requiring a match section (unlike statistical joins). Results are displayed in a
Joins table, which you can download as a CSV, or for event-to-event joins,
exported to a datatable for further analysis.
For more information, see Implement joins without a match section .
Outer joins : Search now supports left and right outer joins. Unlike standard
inner joins, these operations let you retrieve all records from a primary
data source even if no matching entry exists in the secondary source (unmatched
fields are returned as null ). This action lets you correlate data
without losing unmatched events.
For more information, see Correlate data with outer joins .

Announcement
Enhanced rule observability: New metadata, visual indicators, and dashboards
Google Security Operations has introduced updates to how detection and alert data is processed and visualized. These changes help Google SecOps teams distinguish between primary rule runs and rule replays , which provides clarity on detection delays and the impact of late-arriving enrichment data.
Key improvements
Enhanced metadata : Detection and alert objects now include specific metadata that identifies whether they were produced during a primary rule run, or as part of a rule replay or retrohunt.
Improved troubleshooting : This data lets Google SecOps teams definitively answer critical operational questions, such as the cause of perceived detection delays or the specific impact of late-arriving enrichment data on active rules.
Rule replay insights : Learn more about the distinction between primary runs and replays to manage the re-enrichment of Unified Data Model (UDM) events. For detailed definitions and technical workflows, see Understand rule replay and Understand rule detection delays .
New detection dashboard : To support these backend metadata changes, a new Detection Health dashboard is now available. This interface provides a visual representation of rule performance and replay status, letting teams monitor detection health more effectively.
Custom reporting : There are new fields available in the Detections schema , letting you build custom dashboards.
New metadata and third-party integration : Detections and alerts now emit specific metadata to help customers track timing and latency. This data is available for integration with third-party systems using the following fields:
detectionTimingDetails : An enum identifying the run type:
DETECTION_TIMING_DETAILS_REPROCESSING
DETECTION_TIMING_DETAILS_RETROHUNT
DETECTION_TIMING_DETAILS_UNSPECIFIED
latencyMetrics : Includes timestamps for oldestIngestionTime , newestIngestionTime , oldestEventTime , and newestEventTime .
Enhanced platform and visual indicators :
Alerts and rule details : A new visual indicator in the Detection Type column provides granular details on hover.
Filter facets : The Alerts lister page now includes detection timing details as a filterable facet.
SOAR integration : In the Case Overview , the Composite Detections table now carries through the same iconography for a consistent investigation experience.
February 04, 2026
Feature
The re.capture_all function is now available
The new re.capture_all YARA-L 2.0 function is available in Rules, Search, and Dashboards.

Structured SOAR Python integration logs
Python integration logging has been upgraded to a structured format to eliminate visibility gaps and ensure comprehensive diagnostic coverage in Google Cloud.
This upgrade changes how Python logs are interpreted in the Google Cloud Logging Explorer. Previously, logs were bundled into a single block per execution. Now, every log line is interpreted as a separate entry, allowing for granular filtering, better searchability, and easier debugging of specific events.
Recommended Actions:
Update Log-Based Alerts: Ensure alerts triggered by string matches are compatible with individual log entries rather than bundled blocks.
Review Automation Scripts: Test any external scripts or BigQuery exports that parse textPayload against the new granular format.
Verify Dashboards: Custom monitoring dashboards may show an increase in event counts as executions are no longer bundled.

Note: Because the reference list functionality is being phased out of the Google SecOps platform (see "Reference lists" in Feature deprecations ), we recommend that you use data tables to provide expanded functionality, instead of reference lists.

Announcement
Forwarder component: end-of-life and migration
The forwarder component is being phased out of the Google SecOps platform and will reach end-of-life (EOL) in January 2027. This impact will change all any data collection pipelines that currently use the forwarder.
Action required : If you're currently using the forwarder component, you must migrate your data collection workflows to an alternative mechanism before April 1, 2027. You'll need to use another data pipeline management application for log ingestion.
We recommend that you migrate to the Bindplane OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector , which provides a scalable, open-standard solution for log and metric ingestion.
The following are key dates to note:
Apr 1, 2026 : New Google SecOps customers cannot use the forwarder component.
Jan 1, 2027 : The forwarder is officially EOL. No further patches, including security patches, will be released.
Apr 1, 2027 : Data is no longer allowed to be ingested from the forwarder component.

has been replaced by the Alerts API. To ensure that your data feeds continue without
interruption, you may need to update your API permissions.
This change impacts you if your Google SecOps tenant meets both of the following conditions:
You use the CrowdStrike Detection Monitoring API connector, which ingests the CS_DETECTS log type.
The CrowdStrike API client configured for that feed lacks the permissions to read alerts Read.
To prevent disruption to your CrowdStrike data ingestion, you must update your API
client permissions before September 30, 2025.
Follow the instructions in Migrate from CrowdStrike Detects API to Alerts API
to migrate your configuration to use the Alerts API.
For more details, see CrowdStrike’s official decommissioning notice .

Feature
Data tables
Data tables are multicolumn data constructs that let you input your own data into Google SecOps. They can act as lookup tables with defined columns and the data stored in rows. You can create or import a data table to your Google SecOps account using the Google SecOps UI, the data tables API, or by using a YARA-L query in rules. This feature is in public preview.
Feature
Enhanced Cloud Threat Detections by adding three new rules to the AWS - GuardDuty rule set.
February 15, 2025
Feature
This feature is available in Preview.
New options to close a case
New custom field options have been added to the SOAR Settings > Case Data > Close Case page. Once you define these fields, analysts must enter specific types of information when closing a case.
For more information, refer to Customize the Close Case dialog .
Feature

Change
The Google SecOps team identified that a cloud threat detection rule pack (azure-defender-for-cloud-vm-extensions) was inadvertently made available to all customers. The licensing requirements restrict the availability of this rule pack to only Enterprise and Enterprise+ customers and this has been corrected.
This change should not remove any prior detections for customers who have enabled this rule pack and do not meet the licensing requirements but the rules themselves will now be unavailable and no new detections will generate.
Deprecated
After July 2025, the Enterprise Insights page and the CBN alerts will no longer be available. Use the Alerts and IOCs page to view the alerts. We recommend that you migrate the existing CBN alerts to the YARA-L detection engine .
Change
The prioritization logic of Applied Threat Intelligence (ATI) rule set has been improved to remove alerts from events that have a specified security result action of BLOCKED or QUARANTINED. This change only impacts the IP address indicator types for both High and Active Breach priority. For more information, see View details about rule sets .

Change
Looker dashboard updates
The following changes have been made to the Looker dashboards in Google SecOps:
All dashboards have been moved to the ingestion_metrics_connector explore.
The ingestion_stats , ingestion_metric_with_ingestion_stats and ingestion_metrics explores are no longer supported.
The total_entry_number and total_size_bytes fields are defined in the new explore and used to query the log count and log volume for the Google SecOps Ingestion API. For more information, see the Ingestion metrics field reference for dashboards .
The default dashboards for Context aware detections risk and Cloud detection and response overview have been updated to use a different field for the risk score. It was rule_detections.outcomes['risk_score'] and is now rule_detections.risk_score . This change aligns the risk score in the Google SecOps dashboards to the risk score used in the Google SecOps user interface.
The severity field in the Rules and detections default Dashboard has been updated so that it would show the severity for both Curated Detections and custom rules.

Feature
You can now set up feeds to push logs using an HTTPS endpoint by using either the feed management user interface or the feed management API . You can use the following feed management source types to set up ingestion using an HTTPS endpoint:
Amazon Data Firehose
Google Cloud Pub/Sub
Webhooks
You can also generate a secret key and API key to authenticate feeds that use Amazon Data Firehose and webhooks as the feed source type.
Change
The feed management feature is now enhanced to include the following:
Feed names : You can assign custom names to new and existing data feeds.
Troubleshooting information : You can diagnose error feeds by accessing detailed information about the cause of an issue and recommended actions.
Last succeeded time : Stay informed about the status of a feed, with a timestamp identifying when data was last successfully fetched by each feed.

April 22, 2024
Deprecated
The ingestion alerting system using Chronicle has been deprecated. This system will no longer be updated, and no alerts will be sent from this system after September 01, 2024. We recommend that you use the Cloud Monitoring integration which provides more flexibility in alert logic, alert workflow, and integration with third-party ticketing systems.
Deprecated
The ingestion_stats table in BigQuery is deprecated and will no longer be updated after May 15, 2024. We recommend that you use the Chronicle ingestion_metrics table in BigQuery, which provides more accurate ingestion metrics.
April 15, 2024
Deprecated
The following labels fields for UDM nouns are deprecated and these fields will not appear in the search results after November 29, 2024: about.labels , intermediary.labels , observer.labels , principal.labels , src.labels , security_result.about.labels , and target.labels . For existing parsers, in addition to these UDM fields, the logs fields are also mapped to key and value additional.fields UDM fields. For new parsers, the key and value settings in additional.fields UDM fields are used instead of the deprecated labels UDM fields. We recommend that you update the existing rules to use the key and value settings in the additional.fields UDM fields instead of the deprecated labels UDM fields.
April 03, 2024
Announcement
On or after May 1, 2024, in an effort to improve enrichment quality, the enrichment process using telemetry events and entities will prioritize values set by parsers over values from aliases in unenriched events. If a parser does not set the value, the enrichment process will set the enriched value to using aliases.
Feature
Curated Detections rule packs covering AWS threats are generally available to Chronicle Enterprise and Enterprise Plus customers.
March 26, 2024
Announcement
Gemini in Security Operations
Duet AI in Google Cloud is now Gemini for Google Cloud. See our blog post for more information.
March 25, 2024
Feature
Chronicle Applied Threat Intelligence helps you identify and respond to threats. When enabled, it ingests IOCs curated by Mandiant Threat Intelligence with an IC-Score greater than 80 and generates an error when a match is found. The following are some of the features of Applied Threat Intelligence.
Event-level enrichment : All telemetry in Chronicle is enriched with Google Threat Intelligence which is a combination of Mandiant and Virus Total, including all threat intelligence associations like campaigns and actors.
Sophisticated indicator matching : Curated out-of-the-box detections that deliver sophisticated indicator matching using augmented prioritization logic, noise reduction based on customer environment context, and other correlation techniques to maximize signal to noise.
Active breach alerting : Uses Mandiant's incident response intelligence to alert on potential active breaches delivering on our no patient 1 vision.
Curated behavioral detections for emerging threats : To protect against newly emerging risks and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), Applied Threat Intelligence uses real-time insights.
DIY detection engineering and response automation : Access to Fusion intelligence (formerly known as Mandiant Fusion) for the following.
Customer authoring of rules
Customer development of response playbooks
Curated views for Investigation and triage Insights : Applied Threat Intelligence provides curated views that show valuable associations between an indicator and threat actor, threat campaign, or malware, statistics about a threat observed in customer environments. These views are invaluable for all security operations workflows.
For more information about Applied Threat Intelligence, see Applied Threat Intelligence overview .
This note incorrectly states that an error is generated when an IOC match is found. See the entry for May 8, 2024 for the updated statement.
March 22, 2024
Feature
Chronicle now supports direct ingestion and parsing of reCAPTCHA Enterprise logs from Google Cloud.

Chronicle has added a new rule set to Cloud Threat Detections , called Serverless Threats , that detects activity associated with potential compromise or abuse of server-less resources in Google Cloud, such as Cloud Run and Cloud Functions.
Change
There is no longer a limit on the number of feeds you can create for the same log type in Feed Management.
March 20, 2024
Change
Case filter and URL now in a reciprocal relationship
In the Cases page, the filter and the URL now directly affect each other. Changing the filter changes the URL, and conversely, changing the URL changes the filter.
You can take advantage of this feature by setting a filter for cases and putting the newly created URL in an external dashboard. Clicking on this link would then take you directly to the filtered case queue.
Feature
Chronicle has expanded Cloud Threat Detections to create a detection when findings from Security Command Center Event Threat Detections , Cloud Armor , Sensitive Actions Service , and Custom modules for Event Threat Detection are identified. These detections are available through the following rule sets: CDIR SCC Cloud IDS, CDIR SCC Cloud Armor, CDIR SCC Impact, CDIR SCC Enhanced Persistence, CDIR SCC Enhanced Defense Evasion, and CDIR SCC Custom Module.

Jobs Enhancement
When updating an integration, the jobs will now be updated automatically.
This does not apply to any legacy jobs that were created before October 2023.
The Marketplace integration will clearly identify the legacy jobs that are affected and provide instructions on how to proceed.
In addition, legacy jobs are now marked as such in the Jobs Scheduler page so that you can take action and resolve issues beforehand.

Feature
Risk Analytics
Google has introduced Risk Analytics to Chronicle. Risk Analytics looks for patterns of risk across your enterprise, assigning risk scores to all entities and activities. These scores are surfaced in the Risk Analytics dashboard which lets you better understand risk in your environment by visualizing entity risk trends.
The dashboard helps you to identify unusual behavior and the potential risk that entities pose to your enterprise. You can specify watchlists of entities you suspect of having greater risk. The watchlists let you more easily monitor risk within your environment.
Risk Analytics also provides both predefined curated detections and YARA-L metric functions for authoring custom rules.
Risk Analytics is available with Enterprise and Enterprise Plus licenses.
Change
When the data ingestion rate for a tenant reaches a certain threshold, Chronicle controls the rate of ingestion for new data feeds to prevent a source with a high ingestion rate from affecting the ingestion rate of another data source. The ingestion volume and tenant's usage history determine the threshold. If the rate of ingestion does not deviate greatly then there is no effect on the ingestion rate.
Change
Chronicle requires a minimum Transport Layer Security (TLS) version of 1.2 to maintain security compliance. Ingestion routing connections that use lower TLS versions are automatically blocked. Upgrade any custom ingestion mechanisms to adhere to TLS 1.2 or higher.

A new section called General has been added to the placeholders. It contains the following placeholders
HostUrl
CurrentUserEmail
CurrentUserID
CurrentUserFullName
CurrentUserRole
Note that the Current User placeholders cannot be used in playbooks or jobs.

Announcement
Welcome to Chronicle Security Operations (SecOps), a Google Cloud service built as a specialized layer on top of Google's core infrastructure, designed for enterprises to privately retain, analyze, and search petabytes of security and network telemetry.
The SecOps platform provides instant context about suspicious and malicious activity. It can be used to detect threats, investigate the scope and cause of those threats, and provide remediation using pre-built integrations with enterprise workflow, response, and orchestration platforms.
The SecOps platform fuses key capabilities of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) and Threat Intelligence from Google Cloud, VirusTotal, and Mandiant.
The Chronicle SecOps platform enables security analysts to analyze and mitigate a security threat throughout its lifecycle by employing the following capabilities:
Collection : Data is ingested into the platform using software forwarders, parsers, connectors, and webhooks.
Detection : This data is aggregated, normalized using the Universal Data Model (UDM), and linked to detections and threat intelligence.
Investigation : Threats are investigated through case management, search, collaboration, and contextual mapping.
Response : Security analysts can respond quickly and provide resolutions using automated playbooks, incident management, and closed-loop feedback.
